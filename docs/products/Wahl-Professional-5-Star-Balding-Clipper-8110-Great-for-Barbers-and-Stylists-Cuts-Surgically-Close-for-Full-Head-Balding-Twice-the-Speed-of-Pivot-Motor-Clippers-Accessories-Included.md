<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> To avoid harm to your skin you have to adjust the cutting blades ( it was not done on factory), otherwise, you will be severely cut.&lt;br /&gt; all other things are fine.</li>
    <li> the clippers cut great and fast don&#x27;t bog down at all  buy them you will love them</li>
    <li> Balding clippers failed to meet my expectations. Based on the reviews that I read, I was hoping for a much closer shave. Using an electric razor works much better if you don&#x27;t want to shave your head on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> One word, outstanding!</li>
    <li> I was in search for a new pair of clippers to shave my head clean as I have for 25 years. The 5 star balding clippers by Wahl just didn&#x27;t cut close enough and required to much effort. Then to top it off, the blades began to darken and show signs of rust 24 hours out of the box!</li>
    <li> GREAT CLIPPERS, QUIET &amp; EXTREMELY EASY TO CLEAN, GREAT TOOL TO KEEP YOU LOOKING .&lt;br /&gt; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!</li>
    <li> This will do what it intends to and can be used with attachments for longer hair. I ordered a set of Wahl attachments that work perfectly. Be careful with the blade if you get it at a point like the side of the back of the neck it will cut you up. Make sure the entire blade is always completely flat touching your skin.</li>
    <li> these are perfect if you are not bald, but have a strong hankerin&#x27; to become bald.  its written right there in the product name.  &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; clipper.  Oh OH! I just remembered something funny to do; if you ever happen to catch a squirrel, give him a hilarious haircut with these.  He&#x27;ll be the talk of the tree-top town.  Maybe he&#x27;ll quit stealing your nuts!</li>
    <li> As others have said if you have any blemishes, skin tags or moles this device will happily remove them for you.  That being said, I love this clipper.  It is so easy to use once you get used to the weight.</li>
    <li> This is the best of many clippers I&#x27;ve purchased over the past 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the construction in comaparison to other brands I&#x27;ve owned is noticeable and appealing. The cut of this balding clipper is excellent, and the blades have not gotten too hot, nor have I suffered cuts or knicks (caution is advised, however, as the closeness of the shave is precise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this clipper lasts over time, I would not hesitate to give it a five-star rating, indicating the perfect match of quality and low price.</li>
    <li> They do just as they say they will. Had no problems with them cutting my head. Wahl is always a safe bet.</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers I have ever used, hands down. Delivers a super close shaved without any knicking, biting, or cutting. Takes me about 5 minutes now to do what took at least a half hour with a Remington. S++ Grade.</li>
    <li> very good stuff i am happy thanks amazon</li>
    <li> They worked well out of the box, and gave a close shave.  I had to use a razor blade to get hair around my ear.  Felt like going to a hair salon without leaving the house.</li>
    <li> I called Wahl and spoke to customer service about which product would be best for me. I wanted something to shave my head and do line ups for my beard. This is what was recommended to me. The item looks beautiful, however, the blade has a slight curve to it, meaning, once adjusted to &amp;#34;zero gap&amp;#34;, it is zero gapped in the center for approximately one-third of the width of the blade, while the edges have a .2mm to .4mm gap. How do I know such minute measurements you say? I am a dental student, and millimeters is what we measure everything in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, it&#x27;s good for balding, but in terms of line ups, not so much. Also, the unit is kinda big, and uncomfortable maneuvering over my own head. I ended up going with the Andis T Outliner instead; it&#x27;s small, and does what I want.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it said it would do.  If you are a man and need to shave bald, then this is the clipper for you.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper gives a very close cut. It&#x27;s almost as if you shaved your head. I like to cut my own hair, it&#x27;s a little tricky cutting around the ears. You have to be careful, because you can cut yourself!</li>
    <li> Very smooth. It has a powerful motor and cuts down to 1 days growth with no nicks or cuts, which says a lot as my skin is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. You&#x27;ve got to keep the blade well oiled d/t overheating. One drawback, after about 10 minutes of coninuous use the clipper casing gets hot.</li>
    <li> It gives a close enough shave for when I don&#x27;t have time to use the Gillette pro glide  power razor</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Exactly what I was looking for. These aren&#x27;t your cheap WalMart special. By neighbor is a professional barber and he pointed them out to me. He was actually going to get them for me but amazon had a better price.</li>
    <li> These clippers keep their promise.  If you don&#x27;t want a close cut, then don&#x27;t buy these clippers.  I searched hard for clippers that would give me the bald fade and these deliver.  Don&#x27;t waste your time buying other clippers that say balding, as I made that mistake.  Get the Wahl 8110 Balding Clippers.</li>
    <li> The clippers were not what I thought.  I wanted balding clippers.</li>
    <li> Wow!  If you are as cheap as I am, then you have been using those $17 clippers from Walmart, Target etc.. Wait until you use these.  These are super sharp and have a heavy feel of quality.  The noise isn&#x27;t outrageous.  My only wish was that it came with a few more choices for length.  I don&#x27;t know why that matters since I&#x27;ve been bald for over 45 years but just the thought I could leave the fringes a little over 1/16th of inch makes me feel good!</li>
    <li> I have used Wahl clippers for over 15 years.  After adjusting my former clippers to the lowest that they could possibly go and without the 0 guard, I was able to achieve a very short cut.  Unfortunately, my hair would grow back within 4-5 days.  I just received the 8110 and could not believe it!  It cuts very short, very comfortable, and I didn&#x27;t have to go over any area that I cut.  I approve these clippers 1000% and can say that as short (bald) as it cuts, no nicks or cuts whatsoever.  I wish that I had known about this product years ago because it would have saved tons of time and discomfort.  This is DEFINITELy worth the 40 bucks.  Now knowing how it performs, I would easily have paid over 100 bucks for this, and I am frugal.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS BALDING CLIPPER ABOUT A MONTH AGO &amp; THE CLIPPER GIVES YOU A VERY CLOSE CUT. THE CLIPPER IS ALSO VERY POWERFUL &amp; EASY TO USE. I GIVE THIS WAHL CLIPPER A 5 STAR RATING!</li>
    <li> This is NOT a true balding clipper. A true balding clipper removes all the hair from your head. This clipper leaves about a two day growth of hair and it is bucky and heavy. Before these I used a Conair clipper that was truely a balding clipper but it is not manufactured anymore.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works as described.  Balding clippers \\&quot;shave\\&quot; your scalp without having to use a razor.  I have been using clippers for years to keep my hair cropped closely and these are the best I have used for that purpose.  This clipper is not for a \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; cut so be careful.  They perform as advertised and leaves your head \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; with just a bit of stubble.  There is no adjustment on this clipper meaning that you can&#x27;t adjust the blades for the length of hair to be left after clipping.  The only downside (if you want to call it that) is that since it can&#x27;t be adjusted for length it really only has one use, although it performs that one job very well.  If you are like me and also have a goatee it was easier to trim my hair and goatee at the same time using the same device by adjusting length.  Now I need to use a beard trimmer along side my balding clippers.  But the upside is that the trims last longer since these clippers cut closer.  Hope this helps guide your decision.  Thanks for reading.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only using the 1/2 guard for now, but these things are spectacular. Well made and do the job that they were meant to do. One day, I&#x27;ll go for the 0 guard..should be fun.</li>
    <li> Great clippers.  The clippers do grab here and there but only when the hand position changes the angle of the blade on the scalp.  Overall, great clippers.  The power does not seem to be anything better than the other Wahls that I have owned and I have been cutting my hair for 15 years.  These are not quiet clippers.  I do think that there are better Wahl clippers out there once they are adjusted.  If you do have problems with these clippers, small adjustments to the blade may fix your problems.  Hope this helped.</li>
    <li> The mechanical action is great and cut is very close, but the blade rusts very quickly if not cleaned immediately.</li>
    <li> If you want the closest thing to a shaved head, these are the clippers to have.  High quality, very smooth, quiet and gets the job done right.  Was using an Oster product for years and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.</li>
    <li> Well, I can&#x27;t complain. For a 42$ clipper, It gets the job done, and it looks well built. I use the #1.5 guard, but it sucks that it don&#x27;t come with #1. Didn&#x27;t really have to run over the head to cut all the long hair, but I ran over once after the first time just to make sure. Overall, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for quite a few years and quite frankly, while I enjoy the razor shave, it gets to be very expensive. At $14 bucks a pack of 4 razors, which last me for about a month, I wanted to find something that shaved me pretty close without all the cost. This certainly does that. I grew out my hair for 7 days and it zipped through it like nothing and was about as close as I could get without a razor. I&#x27;d say it was about one day of growth, maybe slightly less, after I was done.   Yes, it can be messy with all the little hairs, but anyone who has shaved at all knows that is just how it goes. For the $40 I paid for this, it was well worth it. It sounds powerful, comes with two attachments if you chose to use them, small bottle of oil and combs/brushes to use to clean it. All in all, I am very happy with the purchase and for the use I chose for it.</li>
    <li> This balding clipper is solidly built, fast cutting, and comes with very sharp clipping blades. It has a nice heft to it and appears to be well built. I bought this for my husband.  He was struggling with his old clipper to the point he neglected to keep his beautiful head shaved. This clipper is so nice his head is always looking good now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a 7 1/2&#x27; permanently-attached cord which is convenient, and it has a built-in loop on the back for hanging. It comes with 1/16\\&quot; and 3/16\\&quot; cutting guides. Because he wants a shorter cut, my husband just uses the clipper with the built-in head only and it gives him the look we both want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with anything so powerful, fast and sharp you do have to use caution until you get used to using this clipper. I can see where it could nick or cut you if you weren&#x27;t careful--especially using it without a cutting guide as my husband does.  He shaves his head every few days and hasn&#x27;t nicked or cut himself yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb, cleaning brushes, and lubricating oil are the same as you get with the less expensive clippers. It would be nice if it came with a zippered or plastic storage container but it doesn&#x27;t. The thin plastic tray that came as packaging is not going to last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the purchase of this clipper my husband always used the less expensive clippers and after awhile the blades would become dull and the clipper head clogged and he would just throw it out and buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The didn&#x27;t work like the said they but it was ok</li>
    <li> These clippers are everything the advertisement claims. At least one previous review from a barber warns these clippers are very sharp. This is true, but after a couple of uses, they dull down just a bit like every other clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. Not in the sense of cutting less well, but they aren&#x27;t likely to cut your scalp quite so easily. As an aging man who is nearly bald, I use this product every five days or so to keep the remaining hair down near the scalp and out of my way. In my experience, you can get a closer cut from razors, but that&#x27;s a lot more work and risk to the skin. You can&#x27;t buy at any price clippers which would cut closer than these with the same level of safety.</li>
    <li> Shaves quick but an hour later my head and neck still burn pretty bad first few times using it (wanted closest shave so didnt use the attachments). Perhaps using the pre-shave brush would have helped, but, um.... Don&#x27;t know how to use that... Now a few years later doesn&#x27;t really burn afterwards anymore.  Not that great with hair on back of neck though</li>
    <li> It does what it says. The other statements as far as the sharpness of this are true so be careful. Also, don&#x27;t let your 10 year old even out the back edging like I did!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product and it did work well for about 4 months. Now I need to hit it on something to start the blades. I only give one star because I know people only read the 5 star reviews and the 1&#x27;s. With saying that my 2 friends have the same clippers and it works well for them. I will be buying another balding clippers hoping it not a piece of *&amp;$# this time.</li>
    <li> A pair of clippers that won&#x27;t cut me. Very smooth. Cleans everything.  I can cut my hair in 5 mins...  Thanks.</li>
    <li> A well made product that does the job I expected.You could not get any closer unless you shaved your head.</li>
    <li> Very good clipper that meets all of the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Bottom line up front - This set of clippers are the best I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a few others have noted you get the clippers, a small bottle of oil, barber comb, cleaning brush, pre-shave brush, and two guards. On the first haircut I could easily see the quality of the clippers. They do cut very close to the skin but my son didn&#x27;t experience any irritation, nor any anything worse. (I did check and slightly realign the blades when I first opened the box.). In short, they cut perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who likes tight haircuts then these are the clippers you need. High quality, very close cutting, and much better than using regular clippers for the same type of haircut. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy, well constructed one purpose clipper. If what you want is a good, very close cropped head then this is the tool to use. They&#x27;re not to be used for styling or \\&quot;touch ups\\&quot;. They allow two heights, almost gone and gone. They&#x27;re easy to use, no mirror necessary, your hand will tell you whether you&#x27;ve covered the whole head. The up side is that if you&#x27;re used to paying as little as $6.00 (the local going price for a \\&quot;crew\\&quot; or \\&quot;butch\\&quot; cut, or just to have your head shaved)then it won&#x27;t take long to save the money the clippers cost. Even if one uses a blade occasionally to really get it bald, these are still helpful as a \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; tool. Their closet cut produces as close to bald as one can get without a blade. Worthwhile purchase for those who will use it but, remember, it only cuts one way. If you&#x27;re contemplating anything thing other than the shortest of cuts, look elsewhere.    I should add that elsewhere on Amazon.com it&#x27;s possible to buy additional blades that will allow longer cuts.</li>
    <li> this was a gift to my son, he loves it</li>
    <li> Great quality set of clippers. Wahl made a great set of clippers that are made to last, just lightly oil after each use and this will last a really long time.</li>
    <li> I Haven&#x27;t use it on my hair yet, only on fical hair but it seem to work just great.   The only problem is, it leave mark on your skin, but the marks goes away in few days.  It is a good balding Clipper. I give it 4 out of 5 stars</li>
    <li> If you want a close, like \\&quot; peachfuzz \\&quot; close these clippers are for you. Don&#x27;t assume that all clippers cut this close. They don&#x27;t. Only \\&quot;balding clippers\\&quot; cut super close. So if you want super close comfortable haircut these clippers are for you. Wahl makes a superior products that I have used for many years.</li>
    <li> This product is the Cadillac of clippers. Its so effective, I cut every morning and it takes me about 3 minutes each morning. Been using it for about 6 months continuously, and it still cuts great. People say its very sharp, I guess that might mean their skin is not conditioned to skin barbing, I guess they will have to use it a couple of time. Though you still have to be careful no matter what type of clipper you are using. If you are looking for something to give you an almost nothing look, get this. Always remember to clean and oil after every cut (important). Bought one also from Amazon UK (has a different voltage setting) and sent to my brother in Germany, he reported that it works the same. Overall, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers. Work perfectly, very smooth, &amp; I like the extra combs and accessories. Perfect for me.</li>
    <li> the clipper is powerful and does the job well. don&#x27;t forget this is a head balding clipper and don&#x27;t use it on your face. because i tried it to shave my beard, thing this clipper is not made for, its contact with the skin causes feeling of electric tingling.</li>
    <li> After reading the many reviews (mostly positive) I decided to purchase this.  I have to say it works well.  While it doesn&#x27;t compare to shaving your head with a straight razor, it does come very close.  The only negative is that it is a little on the heavy side, but considering the price and the great job it does, it&#x27;s really not much of an issue.    I live in Chicago, and generally spend about $20 to get my head shaved at a barber shop so this thing paid for itself after just a few cuts.      Thumbs Up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many clippers throughout my life, most of which I have chosen the shorter (buzz cut) hairstyle.  This set cuts the closest, and is of the highest quality I have ever used.  I don&#x27;t imagine this one will fail nearly as soon, but would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Gives you a nice close cut.. Easy to use and Includes mirror,  comb and cleaning brush.. And enough  blade oil for about 3-6 months how often you cut.. Not bad as a trimmer also.</li>
    <li> I just sent this message to Wahls...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello Wahls,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving my head with a razor blade for about 7 years, but the high cost of quality razor blades provoked me to purchase your \\&quot;balding clippers\\&quot;. I thought that I would save money in the long run by purchasing an electric device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been so disappointed in a product in my life. My head is cut to shreds, with patches of irritated skin throughout. Your clippers are simply too sharp to be used by a non-barber. I have used electric shavers on my head from time to time, but nothing I&#x27;ve ever used resulted in such a disaster as these clippers. I&#x27;m ashamed to go to work tomorrow my head is so destroyed from your product. The back of my neck is burning with intense irritation...I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m going to sleep comfortably this evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahls is a trusted brand with a great reputation. I have used other Wahls products before and was always satisfied. However, because this product caused me such discomfort and embarrassment, I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER WAHLS PRODUCT EVER AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The employees who are responsible for creating and testing these clippers should be fired immediately. These clippers are a danger to the user and an absolute embarrassment to the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for...well nothing,</li>
    <li> Works great for me. Just keep up with the cleaning after every use. Oil the blades to keep it from scrathing you up.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent clipper; very well built.  It rivals a professional clipper. It cuts effortlessly with virtually no skin sensation.  Very quiet also. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The problem that I find with this clipper is that its billing as the \\&quot;balding clipper\\&quot; is misleading.      With all those pictures at the Wahl website illustrating the results obtained with this clipper, with heads looking shaved (as with a blade), I expected a closer cut than what I got.  In my head, you can clearly see stubble (unlike in those pictures), and you can feel it just as well.    Someone said that the results are similar to a day&#x27;s growth from a razor shave.  In my case,  it&#x27;s more like a 3rd day&#x27;s growth from my razor shaves.     I bought this clipper because I was looking for a faster alternative to the blade.  So far the only comparable alternative that I&#x27;ve found is an electric shaver, but that&#x27;s not really faster, it takes almost as long as shaving with a blade.    So after using this clipper I asked myself:  \\&quot;Should I return it?\\&quot; And I realized:  But then, what am going to buy?  I still don&#x27;t know of anything better, probably this is as good as it gets with a clipper, and for the sake of speed, I&#x27;ll take it.  It&#x27;s good enough.  Just don&#x27;t expect your head to look like the ones on those pictures.</li>
    <li> Works great. Been using clippers on lowest setting since 1996. These do take it just a bit closer. No adjustment setting on these clippers they are fixed. I have tilted the clippers to see at what point it would start to nick into the skin and did not receive any nicks. I think these are good quality clippers for the money. My other Wahl Professionals are 19 years old and still going strong. Keep them clean and oiled is all it takes.</li>
    <li> I had previously written a very positive review of these clippers but am now forced to change it.  I&#x27;ve had 3 sets of these clippers over the years as they have worn out, etc.  My first set was awesome.  It lasted years and gave me a superclose shave and never cut me.  Then when I needed another set just a few months back, they cut me several times.  Thought it might have been a bad set so I sent it back and got a new one.  Now the new one does the exact same thing.  I&#x27;ll be shaving with it then it will get caught on my skin for no reason.  There&#x27;s not a blemish there or anything, it just gets caught and will cut you.  I&#x27;m under the impression that Wahl has changed how they manufacture these clippers than they used to but I&#x27;m never using mine again.</li>
    <li> Great clippers and service.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea these are for balding and have a sharp blade that cuts close like a razor. Only reason i did not keep there clippers is because i did not realize there was no lever to adjust these. I switched to the Andis Master II because it has a lever so i can fade.. But i still recommend these for just bolding...</li>
    <li> Works Great for guys that want a very close clipper cut without shaving the head. The next best thing!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head clean for the last decade. I got over the blade shaving when I found the Balder by Whal. This incarnation is perfect! I love the improved power cord and the overall feel. I have been buying one every 8 months for the last 10 years and I feel this one may last a good deal longer. Not that I&#x27;m complaining. The price/time vs a professional haircut is no contest. I&#x27;ll happily buy this again, if I need to.</li>
    <li> This is the clipper I was seeking for my balding shaving. I am a Black man, and this is my second clipper. I uesd to clip my head every day but with the 8110, I clip once or twice a week. It shaves my head real neat.I thumb my chest for the little reseach I did prior to ordering the 8110 from Amazon. This was a great purchase. I recommend this clipper to a balding person who loves to be groomed in 3 minutes.</li>
    <li> Product seem to be ok. but regretfully it comes with no ac adapter matching electricity of 220w .So i had to replace the cutting head with an old machine i got at home. the head itself works very well.</li>
    <li> The product was great, but the description said it would come with 2 blades, but it did not...    Includes 2 cutting guides (1/16 inch - 3/16 inch)</li>
    <li> So for years i would buy clippers from walmart, target, etc... for roughly $15 and finally got tired of purchasing one every 4-6 months.  So i purchased this unit and WOW, what a difference.  The minute i held it in my hand, you could tell it was of good quality.  Cuts pretty close to bald and it wasnt a hassle.  what would have taken me about 45 minutes with my previous set took me about 15 minutes. This thing CUTS!!   The only thing i would have like would have been additional guard.  it only comes with two, A 1/16 and 3/16 but i could have used a few more.  I was able to use the guard from my previous set thought it did sit flush.</li>
    <li> My husband is a balding man and he shaves what hair he has down closely. These clippers did a beautiful job and was quieter than any other clippers he has used in the past. Really like them!</li>
    <li> The clippers perform excellent!  I bought them based on the customer reviews which were 100% accurate.  Would definitely recommend them to anyone wanting a clipper that cuts nearly as close as a razor.</li>
    <li> Love it, very heavy which is why like it the most.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think you could use it on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get an older child or spouse to use it on you, it is a recession-buster.</li>
    <li> Yes, there are reviews of people talking about nicks from the blade, and yes it is sharp. But like every blade you have to be careful, especially one that is electric which moves fast and second is meant for balding, which obviously implies SHARP.  It does a fairly close shave, and would have to save the item is solid and sturdy.</li>
    <li> First let me say that Wahl products rock. To all those people who said they cut themselves using this clipper, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. It says you have to adjust these blades before using. As far as the \\&quot;noise,\\&quot; it tells you what to do for that too. Before I used this, I did the appropiate adjustments and what do ya know, no cuts or irritations. So READ first people, those negative comments almost made me change my mind about this clipper. Glad I didn&#x27;t. It gives a close enough trimming to the point of if I didn&#x27;t want to use a blade after, I could get away with it. Great product! Happy clipping folks!</li>
    <li> I ordered these clippers for my husband and he loves them and uses them all the time, thanks and the price was just right.</li>
    <li> is there any clipper combs for this?Because i baught these and they should be coming pretty soon so please reply.</li>
    <li> The Baldie is the best clipper out there. All the other reviews are right. It cuts very close and clean for bald guys as the reviews say. I also have not seen any cuts/nics. It works great I would recommend this to anyone who does not use a blade to cut their head. I was nervous the first time I used it but now I fly through my cuttings. Make sure to keep it oiled to ensure it&#x27;s cutting ability.</li>
    <li> For twenty-five years I&#x27;ve shaved my head (razors, electric razors, or just two to three times a week with clippers).  My old (standard) clippers died and I came across reviews for the Wahl balding clipper.  I was apprehensive about some of the reviews that claimed nicks and cuts but I bought it anyway.  Mine arrived yesterday and I used it this morning.  Although I&#x27;ve got very fair skin and-- like another reviewer-- the folds of skin on the back of my head that come with maturity and a little extra poundage, the new balding clippers worked great and I had no nicks or cuts whatsoever.  I hope those who claimed they got nicks and cuts from this clipper actually learn how to shave their heads properly with a clipper.</li>
    <li> ok so don&#x27;t get it twisted these suckers are at first not for do it yourself head shavers, which is what i am. i ate my head to crap the first time i used them, but its ok, use your head adjust the blades a little bit and your in business. these get very close even after the adjustment, they would get super close if you could have some one cut your hair for your, but you need to adjust these to a safe setting for a diy. i would buy these again they make shaving my head super close and very fast as you need only go over your head once.  minus one star because they should come pre adjusted to a safer setting with the ability to go closer, not the other way around.</li>
    <li> I shave my head completely bald using blades and shaving oil and have done so for many years.  Smooth painless shave.  Sometimes if I go too long without shaving, my hair gets too long to hack through with blades which is why I bought this. It gets the job done. I&#x27;d dread having to use this thing to shave my head on a regular basis though... leaves my scalp feeling a bit raw with some cuts as well.  It won&#x27;t be an issue for you if you use this clipper with the guides that are included and probably this is as good a clipper as you can get.</li>
    <li> I had the cheaper version of these professional clippers for the last few years. I didn&#x27;t especially like the way they cut and how harsh the clippers were on my scalp. I do like this professional version of the clippers quite a bit. They are smooth and provide an even cut without discomfort. They seem very steady and ready for long term use. I guess the only way to know if they are going to be worth it is with long term use.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it. He spend less time shaving his head. He said he only has to go over it a couple of times to get a clean cut. Material appears to be very durable and professional.</li>
    <li> THEY REALLY SET THE BAR HIGH ON THIS ONE THE BEST CLIPPER EVER TRUST ME I WAS SCEPTIC AT FIRST BUT WHEN I RECEIVE MY ORDER I HAD TO TRY IT AND SORRY MERRIL BAAAAMMMMM  THE BEST PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Sad mine stopped working after two years, easily the best clippers I have ever owned well worth the cost compared to the cheaper $20-30 clippers.</li>
    <li> These clippers are really good. They cut my hair so short without the guard its unreal! almost looks like i took a razor to my head. It comes with a guard that leaves just enough stubble for a clean looking buzz cut. These clippers also run very quiet compared to my others. Best choice i made since i cut my hair twice a week! great buy look no further!</li>
    <li> Just purchased the clippers through amazon, and they work great! I am happy with this wahl product, i was using a wahl metro to bald my head, but the balding clippers work even better, both are a little heavy, but the balding clippers really clip close. great product by wahl.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this item to anyone who wants a close shave. Smooth clean cut without the guards. I liked the fact there was no adjustment on the blades.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Andis 08770 and this clipper at the same time. I know there are a lot of positive reviews for this item and I respect that but in my personal use I found it uncomfortable. Yes, this is a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; product but so is the Andis and the Oster 76 classic which I also own. The item does not feel as comfortable in the hand as the Andis. If you read the positive reviews and it sounds right for you it just might be. But I would not choose this product again.</li>
    <li> I like my hair short. This does the job, allows me to go two weeks between cuts with an even growth of hair after this period of time. If you like a military cut (not skin head) this razor will do the job.</li>
    <li> About four years ago my stylist pointed out that my hair was thinning. That&#x27;s when I noticed I was starting to bald. I did some research and realized there was nothing I could do. I decided to shave my head with a razor. Bad times, I tell you. I never shaved my head again. I decided to buy a $40 Wahl clipper from walmart. It has served me decent for about three and half years. There was always something missing. I never got the clean cut that I really wanted and it always took a long time going over and over the same areas again so that I did not miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago I decided I wanted more from my haircuts and decided to try something new. I always wanted a closer cut but not quite the shaved look. I automatically went for the Wahl brand because I was most familiar with them. I discovered this wonderful balding clipper and immediately ate up all the reviews. There seem to be so many positives so I decided to give this clipper a try. I guess it couldn&#x27;t hurt for only $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I decided to give these clippers a try. I was pretty much blown away! Most of the reviews were right. These clippers really dig deep and they cut very clean. I used to hate cutting my hair because it was such a hassle and took so long because I had to keep going over and over to make sure I did not miss a spot(s). The first time I put these clippers to my head, I knew I had a good thing in my hand. They cut very close and even on the first run through. I only had to go over my entire head twice to get a nice, clean even cut. This took about 1/3 of the time off my normal hair cut. I even found myself enjoying this new device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wait at least five days before a cut. With these new clippers, I think I will be cutting my hair every three to four days. It seems like so much fun and so effortless. I love these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about getting these, just do it. You&#x27;ll love them!</li>
    <li> To me, a clean and shaven head is the best haircut for all men: there&#x27;s nothing to get in your eyes, hardly anything to wash and dry, nothing to stink, nothing to worry about in the morning, and nothing to make you sweat in warm weather.  Before using this clipper, I was using Wahl&#x27;s color clipper and although it is built well, it didn&#x27;t cut my hair short enough.  Furthermore, I needed to make multiple passes over my head to cut every last inch of hair due to the average-powered motor.    After using this clipper, my hair has never looked shorter - it comes close to bald but doesn&#x27;t make it all the way.  The blade is sharp and the motor is strong so I needed only three passes to cut off all the hair on my head.  In short, this is the exact clipper I was looking for.    Caution: you need to go slow because the blades are really sharp and the motor is strong, meaning it will shear everything in its path.  I almost cut myself a couple times.</li>
    <li> The clippers do cut shorter in the back than other clippers I&#x27;ve used do. You aren&#x27;t going to be as bald as a razor gets you but rather about 2 days after a clean shave. A decent amount shorter than normal clippers. I fade my hair and use a razor on the back to fade to the part where I used no guard. There&#x27;s a distinct line between where I used the razor and where I used the clippers with other clippers. With this pair, it blends in perfectly. These clippers don&#x27;t cause cuts or anything like that like other people have said in their reviews (at least on me). My only complaint is that after 5 haircuts, the blade is already showing some rust spots. I&#x27;ve used to oil and cleaned the clippers off after every cut too. These are priced pretty high for just a pair of clippers, small bottle of oil, and 2 guards but it&#x27;s worth it if you are like me and really like your hair shorter than most clippers get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no hairdresser but to me these clippers feel like a professional set. They&#x27;re heavy and sturdy and powerful! They have a thick, no-nonsense cord. Just sturdy! Oh, and they cut hair really well too, no more \\&quot;catching\\&quot;. I&#x27;d recommend these for sure!</li>
    <li> Awesome clipper, I wish i would have bought this clipper long time ago. The clipper is well made and light on the hand. Yes! it is sharp to the teeth and cuts very close to the skin. Who needs a razor!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase of the Wahl Balding Clipper. You get a professional clipper without the professional price. It cuts as close as you can get without using a razor...just as advertised. The clippers also arrived in a very timely manner.  I spent years wasting my money on $10 clippers. It took about 4 or 5 days for my hair to grow to the length that cheap clippers cut it to after a fresh haircut. Invest in these clippers, they will save you money in the long run!</li>
    <li> Great clippers!  Very pleased.  Quiet and powerful and the 000000 blades almost shave.  My wife likes using these better than regular clippers.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve lost hair over the years, it&#x27;s started to seem pointless to pay for professional haircuts. I purchased these to keep myself closely groomed. They are well made and will definitely do the job. However, they&#x27;re not without flaws: (1) They only include two guides. One for a very close cut and another for a less severe look. It would have been nice if they woud have included a variety of guides, especially an extremely close cut guide. (2) The guides are made of cheap feeling plastic. They&#x27;re not of the same quality that you see in professional clippers. (3) They don&#x27;t include a storage bag. I ended up storing them in one of those freebie shaving kits you get when you buy cologne. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they will do what you want and they&#x27;re not hard at all to use. They just should have been a little more attentive to detail.</li>
    <li> THE BEST clippers for balding or nearly balding hair. Nothing else matches these. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several clippers of different brands but I found that this clipper is the best one that I have used to cut a clean, close balded head. Although the clipper is a little heavy but it gets the&lt;br /&gt;job done the best and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> it does amazing job. I like it!</li>
    <li> These are my bulk hair cutting clippers.  I can do about 80% of a haircut with these clippers ranging from, 45&#x27; flat tops, 0 - 5 fades, full tapers, and free hand cutting.  I have mine paired with a custom vacuum system so the hair is immediately pulled away from the customers head.  This keeps the clippers cool and clean even when using them for 3-4 hour rushes when they come.  I think I bought my first pair for about $50ish.  They, along with my time and effort have given me back at least $50,000.  I would say these clippers are a worth wile investment to a serious professional barber.  As well, personally, I prefer these to the bulkier Andis masters which tend to create more heat when you get really busy and don&#x27;t have time to switch clippers.</li>
    <li> Powerful and quiet, provides a very close cut.  Other reviews have mentioned that the clippers nipped their scalp.  I had no problem with that and I use the metal head directly on my skin.  I&#x27;ve had these clippers for a year and have been very pleased.</li>
    <li> These clippers do all that you expect.  No doubt you will get a close a shave as you can get with out the use of&lt;br /&gt;a blade. I used to shave my head with a Andies T-outliner.  That gave a close cut but it was tough on the motor and blade as it was not designed to cut an entire scalp.  These clippers are and do cut even closer.  The one and only set back of these clippers is that you WILL nick/cut your scalp if you do it yourself or have someone who does not know how to put clippers at the right angle do it for you.  I read a review that said they were sharp and will cut you. I liked my odds so I got them anyway.  I was wrong.  However, they cut so close and so quick that I will continue to use them with the UTMOST care.  Going to have to be very carful going forward.</li>
    <li> I received those clipper on time but they couldn&#x27;t work properly.  Extremely noisy, extremely vibrating (the blades couldn&#x27;t stay in place), smoke appeared from the engine after a few minutes of use.  I sent them back and ask for a refund.  Bad news I&#x27;m in Australia and I had to pay AUD$ 40.00 to ship them bcd to the US even if Amazone covers the shipping fees up to US$ 10.00!</li>
    <li> Wahl Professional balding clippers. I&#x27;ve owned dozens of clippers over the years and these are by far the best set I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I just shaved my head with extreme ease. The blades are sharp and the motor is strong. Great buy</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and an excellent product. These clippers were exactly what I was looking for without having to bic my head. These are an awesome product and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was searching for.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful motor that allow a clean and sharp cut and for a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;I dont give five stars for one reason: Too few accessories... I guess they could give more options for different cut sizes.&lt;br /&gt;Despite that fact I only have compliments for the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recomend...</li>
    <li> I have gone through lots and lots of trimmers over the years for shaving my head. I usually get the $10 to $20 battery operated beard type trimmers, use them without any guards, and they last me a year or so. I was excited when I saw the reviews for this item because I figured I&#x27;d finally found an item that would, not only cut closer, but would last longer. After a number of weeks using it, I&#x27;ve determined that I don&#x27;t think it cuts any closer than a beard trimmer. In fact it might not even cut as close as one. This thing is built like a tank and probably would last a very long time. However, it makes it extremely heavy and awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that a beard trimmer will cut just as close, maybe even closer, and will be much easier to handle (allowing for a more accurate cut). I think I&#x27;ll probably move on to the \\&quot;Wahl Peanut\\&quot;, which is what I was going to buy before seeing the amazing reviews on this balding clipper. I think the \\&quot;Peanut\\&quot; will bridge the gap between usability and reliability. I like Wahl products, I just don&#x27;t think this one is all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be. I rated it one star in the hopes that it would skew the average a little and get people to read my review. Actually, it&#x27;s probably worth about 3 to 3.5 stars so long as you know what you&#x27;re getting into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- update --- 03/09/2012&lt;br /&gt;I skipped over the Wahl \\&quot;Peanut\\&quot; in favor of the Wahl Professional 8081 \\&quot;Detailer\\&quot; and boy does it work well for shaving my head. Check out my review on that product.</li>
    <li> This shaver works as advertised and should last me awhile. It is quite powerful but I managed to shave my head which was already pretty short (maybe 2/16&#x27;s) without scalping myself.</li>
    <li> I just bought one... been using the CVS/Walgreens&#x27; consumer quality ones for years. This one feels much sturdier but more importantly, it gives a much closer cut than those. it is as close to a shave as I could possibly expect. Very happy with it. Definitely worth the 2x price compared to the consumer quality trimmers.</li>
    <li> Anyone deciding to purchase, this item doesn&#x27;t come with guards. I ran down to the beauty supply shop and purchased a set of guards for about $5. These Balding clippers are awesome. They clip effortlessly without any drag and stay cool. The long cord is great while clipping your own hair, just don&#x27;t get too twisted ;)</li>
    <li> Works great and paid 50% less than at salleys!</li>
    <li> very good clipper! although when I first got my hands on them they where overlapping , with a little maintenance done I got them to work just fine . very sharp I recommend to have that in consideration when cutting against the back of the clients neck. 6 op blade cuts as close as any trimmer or even closer very good machine I am well pleased.</li>
    <li> Have been happily using the Wahl Color Pro 79300 for probably 6 years before the motor died and I needed a replacement.  Decided to try these since it sounded like they cut a tad shorter.  Well, it certainly is shorter but man is it painful.  I was cringing the entire time I used it and afterwards, my head was in pain for a few hours and had red marks all over!  Like I said, been using clippers for over 6 years now and generally shave my head with a razor during summer and have never had a problem whatsoever.  Planning on returning these and going with the 79300 again.  Other benefits of the 79300 -- the clippers are wider so it takes less time and the motor seemed more powerful so it mows through your hair even when its a tad long.</li>
    <li> Would be extremely pleased with product if there were shorter guard.  Does not get bald cut with existing guard. Be careful if cutting without guard unless you want to give lots of blood and skin.  Worth the cost in quality but be careful.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace another Wahl that was 7 years old. This model is excellent. Husband is mostly bald so this takes off the rest of the hair so that he is very nearly clean shaven. Much quicker than the old model - one pass only.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: JUNE 16, 2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is horrible.  It is no longer working correctly.  I can not get it to adjust; using their &amp;#34;troubleshooting&amp;#34;.  It pulls and gouges.  When done shaving - welts, gouges, and scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very quiet&lt;br /&gt;Long cord&lt;br /&gt;Sharp blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not bald like the title states, but I kind of knew that based on other reviews.  It cuts to a fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;The blade area is very straight, so it does not confirm to the head at all.  When doing the top of the head you have to make many passes to get all the spots.&lt;br /&gt;It will gouge you if you are not careful; I think it is a design issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT! I hesitated in buying these because a lot of people were saying that they cut \\&quot;too close\\&quot;, and how they cut up their skin. Remembering those reviews I was VERY careful when I first used them, but the caution was totally unwarranted. Yes, they are SHARP, but if you want to use clippers instead of a razor they have to be. I use them to shave my head &amp; face, and I am VERY happy with these. I don&#x27;t like using razors. Have had a pair of Wahl clippers for about 15 years that I manually adjusted to \\&quot;cut as close as a blade\\&quot; but they are getting old and the cord is loose. I can not tell you how many clippers I have tried, thrown away, and returned because I could not find one that cut as close as those. My search is over. Sometimes I&#x27;m clean shaven, sometimes I like a beard or a goatee. I was using 4 different products to do my head and face, now with these and the full set of guards I also bought, I&#x27;m down to one product.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and good product too.</li>
    <li> My husband is nearly bald but does not like to use a razor on his head.&lt;br /&gt;We were always using a regular clipper without the guard.&lt;br /&gt;This does a much much better job at getting the close cut he likes.&lt;br /&gt;I saw reviews saying that people cut themselves?&lt;br /&gt;I always do the clipping for him and I have never cut him.</li>
    <li> I originally began looking at these clippers after shaving my head to raise money due to a friend with cancer.  I purchased these clippers after reading many other reviews. I saw many reviews say the clippers were very sharp and to be careful not to cut yourself.  Well, I purchased them cautiously and used them expecting to cut myself at least once.  I have used them many times now, never have I cut myself.  Yes, they are very sharp and cut my hair down to appoximately what the length would be after 2 days hair growth after using a razor.  The clippers are excellent and do what they are suppose to do without cutting you.  I am not sure if other guys have a little extra folds of skin on thier heads are what, however, I personally have not cut myself.  I would suggest these to anyone wanting a good pair of balding clippers.  They feel solid, not cheap.  They have a good wieght to them without being heavy.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Very heavy duty. I was not expecting it to be as big and heavy, but it was a pleasant surprise. I have seen complaints of it coming &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;.. The machine comes very well oiled, every dust/dirt particle floating around the warehouse that comes in contact with the clippers STICKS. Idk, it didn&#x27;t bother me. But it can be expected.</li>
    <li> If you want to get rid of that come over this is what you should buy. It is the closest thing to shaving your head. It is sturdy, designed well, and has a commercial grade cord. Came just as described. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I do not understand why they call these balding clippers when they do not give you a cut close enough to be considered bald. This was just another waste of my money in an attempt to lower the cost of keeping my head bald since the good razors are so expensive.</li>
    <li> Product dose what is says. It&#x27;s built well should last.  It comes with two guides in case you want to try the buzz cut.</li>
    <li> The clipper is as good if not better than many pro barber clippers.  This is the one to have!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really a balding clipper, but the front edge is a bit too sharp and occasionally scratch the skin. Anyway, a good balding device.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s close, but not near bald.  About a three day growth is as close as it got and it took alot longer than usual b/c if you go too fast, it cuts and digs into your head.  Don;t waste your time and $.  Reg bic is alot faster and closer.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great for getting a nice short buzz.......BUT be warned these will cut your head up if you don&#x27;t use them right.</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding, really. It is professional quality with a powerful motor. I had 4 weeks of hair growth and on my first cut, my girlfriend shaved me clean bald with this clipper in just 5 to 10 minutes. There was absolutely no irritation on the skin and I simply cannot understand or accept an earlier review stating otherwise. There is no pain or feeling on the skin and it is equivalent to what one would experience when a barber clips your hair. While this clipper won&#x27;t take you as close as a razor would, it is equivalent to a single day&#x27;s hair growth which is exactly what most people like it to look like. This clipper is model #8110 and is part of Wahl&#x27;s professional 5 star series, 785110. To my surprise, the package also included \\&quot;a bonus\\&quot; - two cutting guides (1/16\\&quot; and 3/16\\&quot;). This product should last for a few years and the included oil is to keep the blade rust free - it certainly would help if Wahl had provided more oil but that is really a trivial point. Likewise, while the cord is reasonably long, I would personally have preferred something a bit longer but this is just finicky me pointing another trivial point. Overall, this product is great, priced right, and is as advertised. Finally it is made in U.S.A. so that scored extra points with me!</li>
    <li> I give myself the best haircuts with this clipper. I has paid itself 100 over as I don&#x27;t have to pay for a haircut anymore.</li>
    <li> Works awesome!  Most of the people who don&#x27;t like it didn&#x27;t adjust it well.  That is very important.  You MUST adjust the guard or you WILL get cut.</li>
    <li> They work ok, we use them for body trimming. They scratch you up pretty good and they get SUPER hot! I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Top notch head shaver.</li>
    <li> This Wahl Shaver works perfectly and performs great, definitely what I needed to cut a good cut as I have to trim my hair often.</li>
    <li> Wahl is the best. After resetting the blades to &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; gap they cut as expected. I haven&#x27;t had any nicking issues. Trim my beard and mustache. Using the guard I cut my boys hair with no problems.</li>
    <li> After paying a barber good money to clip my hair, I decided that for what I wanted, I could do it myself, so I purchased this Wahl Balding Clipper (Model 8110) on the recommendation of the sales-lady at Sally&#x27;s. I had never used a clipper or a trimmer or anything like that in my life. Yesterday, I tried it for the first time and I was completely satisfied with this product. It cut my hair in an easy painless manner and after I had finished, I looked exactly as I did when I was getting my hair cut by a barber.  This clipper will pay for itself with the money I save by doing it myself.  I am not that handy with \\&quot;tools\\&quot; but this product was easy to use and I strongly recommend it for anyone that wants the nearly bold look.  (Review based on first-time usage)</li>
    <li> Strong, sturdy and effective. It replaced a cheap, not very good clipper I had for years. I shave my hubby&#x27;s head and with this clipper you get extremely close to the scalp.  Good clipper and the price is fair.</li>
    <li> Product trims extremely close with no guard on. Feels sturdy and does a great job! Motor runs great and seems as though it will last much longer than cheaper brands I have brought in the past.</li>
    <li> This is the best that I&#x27;ve every used for balding my hair every week. I&#x27;m a 27 year old African American male. This is way better for balding your head than the Andi&#x27;s ones I used to get.</li>
    <li> Amazing close shave. I&#x27;m really happy with these clipper. As a useful tip I want to add that your skin may become a little irritated from use, but you are getting a nice shave and your skin needs to get used to it. Do not listen to the reviews of people bleeding from this thing. The reviews worried me and so I started slow- hoping I wouldn&#x27;t cut open my scalp and soon realized that this thing is safe to use. Of course be careful, as with any sharp tool- don&#x27;t dig the sharp end into your scalp, that is all.</li>
    <li> Awesome&lt;br /&gt;I have had other Bald Clippers but this one cuts very close and has all the power you need and more. Worth every penny !! Don&#x27;t hesitate on buying this.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers. They cut my hair very short. Much shorter than than other clippers. I hope to have it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair off since I was 21...for those of you who don&#x27;t me, that&#x27;s twenty years. I&#x27;ve owned nearly every manufacturer of clippers in that time including Andis, Wahl, Oster and Phillips. These clippers are by far the sturdiest, closest cutting and reliable set yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise though...they cut close! If you go in at too steep of an angle, you will abrade/cut your head/neck! With that being said, after the minimal learning curve, I wouldn&#x27;t think of buying any other set. When these die, I will replace them with the same model. If you like your cut close, these are the set for you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different clippers for \\&quot;balding\\&quot; and this is the model to get. Cuts very tight, about like two days growth after a blade shave, and irritation free. I&#x27;ve also tried the Wahl Senior with the adjustable blade, and the Oster Finish Line T-blade Trimmer with the Gold shaving blade. Neither one compares to the Wahl Balding clipper for closeness. The Oster is almost as good but the blade is much smaller and it takes far longer. This Wahl also comes with a 1/16\\&quot; cutting guide that is perfect for eyebrows or close beards, and a snap on blade guard. Keep it cleaned and oiled and it should continue to perform as well as it does now. Very nice tool for the price.</li>
    <li> excellent product especially if you want it super close without bumps (y&#x27;all know who u r, lol).  As warned by others, it will amputate you, so be careful!!!!!</li>
    <li> If used without an attachment the edge gets stuck into my skin and has caused many cuts. Gets short but not even close to bald.  Very uneven cut unless you spend an hour going over every spot a million times. Even after all this effort it&#x27;s still very easy to have a small amount of hair uneven with the rest.    I have cut my own hair with regular clippers with and without attachments for years...these are just wrong.</li>
    <li> Clipper works but box was missing all the other stuff that was listed.  Will not order again!</li>
    <li> Well balance,cuts very close.Please be careful as a previous reviewer had mention the fact that these blades are very sharp.I&#x27;ve been shaving nick free without the guard for years with a Walh Designer model.These Baldys do shave much closer and if you take your time, you&#x27;ll be very please and blood free.</li>
    <li> Great clippers.......They are so sharp and efficient that some time to adjust to them........Really good clippers.......I would recommend them to anyone........</li>
    <li> Wanted a clipper than was easy to use and could cut down to a Number 0.5 level (stubble) - not totally bald (If I wanted totally bald I would shave it!). The Wahl 8110 does the job perfectly and easily. I admit it took a couple of tries to get it done evenly - but once you get the hang of it - 10-15 minutes saves me $20 and I like the result! Nice that cleaning brush, oil etc are included in the kit.</li>
    <li> Works well. Cuts like it should. Has a pretty strange on/off switch. The cord will drive you crazy. It is a constant fight to keep untangled.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Works well for me  and well recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I read a few negative reviews about this product, but i am happy i was not put off.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought a few clippers in my life time, this is the best for a skin shave.&lt;br /&gt;Truly a balding clipper!</li>
    <li> This can trim very close, so you may need to adjust it. I&#x27;d give it 5* if they could prevent hair from getting inside the mechanism or the need to oil often for optimal use.</li>
    <li> This has been the best pair of clippers I have ever purchased.  I previously purchased those cheap \\&quot;at home\\&quot; clipper sets and it left me going over the same spot several times.  This one is heavy so you know it&#x27;s quality.  You go over one spot and the hair is gone.  I also get razor bumps easily and its great because it cuts very close but not close enough to cause the bumps.  Thanks Wahl.</li>
    <li> They do the job, but I drew blood the first attempt because I my ignorance.  It keeps me from having to go to a barber and having to comb my hair.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely fantastic clipper IF you have the experience to use it. It is extremely sharp and cuts perfectly but also cuts easy if you are not careful. I have been using this product for 5 years. Make sure when you use it that you do not shave with it on an angle for any reason or you are guaranteed to cut yourself. Get used to wearing a hat for the first few months while you learn, but believe me, it is worth it because this is the absolute closest shave possible that you are going to get without &amp;#34;bic&#x27;ing&amp;#34; your head.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Wanted that close shave &amp; got it with this.</li>
    <li> it definitely cuts CLOSE but i am too scared to use it right now. it snags and cuts so i end up being so careful with it that it takes me twice as long to do the same thing my cheaper clippers do. im sure the blades just need to be adjusted better but i cant figure it out. it would be nice if they just shipped it set up right but i am patient and will not just write this thing off until i experiment a little bit more. im thinking about polishing the edges of the blade smooth or something..</li>
    <li> A little tricky to use because it cuts so close, but the results are exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> These clippers replaced an old Norelco trimmer that I had used for over 2 years. I was a little nervous about using one based on some of the 2 and 3 star reviews. All I can say is, \\&quot;Why did I wait so long to buy this?\\&quot;    The clipper is very solid - it looks and sounds like something I would see in a barber shop. It is heavy, but not so much that my arm gets fatigued shaving my head. The blades looked to be adjusted properly out of the box (according to the instructions), so I didn&#x27;t have to make any changes.    I was a little hesitant at first about cutting or pulling (as other reviewers reported), but I didn&#x27;t have any problems. My hair was pretty short to begin with - maybe an 1/8 of an inch at most. If my hair was any longer, I would have put one of the guides (either the 1/16 or 3/16) to shorten it before using it in the zero blade mode. It cut evenly and cleanly and I didn&#x27;t see or feel any uneven spots when I was done.    However, I don&#x27;t think it is completely accurate to call it a balding clipper. There are some pictures on the packaging that show heads that look like they were shaved with a razor. I don&#x27;t think it is possible to get that look with this clipper (or any clipper). If I truly wanted a bald look, I would not have given it 5 stars, but I prefer the look of a day or two of growth. For my needs, this clipper does exactly what I want at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> After years of using Andis clippers, and dealing with the small blade, I decided to try these since the cutting edge was wider and I thought they would decrease my time shaving.  Just for the record, I dry shave my face and hair twice a week down to ZERO gauge and have often been disappointed with how long it takes my Andis set to cut (due to small clipper edge).  After reading the reviews for these &#x27;balding clippers&#x27; I bought them and upon first use, they reduced my shaving time by half.  They cut fast, ran smooth and did exactly what I wanted them to do.  One note of caution however and others have said it--BE CAREFUL.  These are sharp and unless you have skin made of sandpaper (especially on the softer parts of the neck!!!), I wouldn&#x27;t recommend going against the grain very fast--at least until you get a feel for them.  Other than that, awesome.  Absolutely awesome.  I just hope they stay sharp!</li>
    <li> Very good quality clipper had to adjust them to get the true bald look though ..if not adjusted properly will cut you</li>
    <li> Probably the best clippers own will ever own. Made By Sterling, out of the  Upper Mid-West, these are top of the line. Beautiful craftsmanship;out of this world performance. Very sharp, very fast, &amp; they don&#x27;t get hot. Just fantastic.  Kudos. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied.  Cuts as close as you are going to get with a set of clippers.  I purchased because shaving my head causes razor burn.  Great set of clippers for the money.  They fell very durable and well made.</li>
    <li> Work great! Very well built. I have owned this product for a few years now and have had zero troubles with it. When the direction say the blades are sharp they are not kidding.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the close cut I get with these clippers. I read a review that they might be too powerful. I  found them to be just right.</li>
    <li> I found these and had to get them, 6x0 purpose built professional clippers for under $50? Built solid and runs cool, feels right in the hand and manuvers with ease. Ok they don&#x27;t give you that silk smooth cut your crossing your fingers for AND are dangerous if not handled correctly this is not a toy they will cut you, and will hurt like hell if not careful. Using the Headblade afterwards is like a dream come true, but if your tired of replacing those cheep clippers from walmart or walgreens cvs every year because they always find some unreal way to commit suicide off your counter breaking the blade off or cracking the housing or just stop working one day before you need it then look no further! Its gets better you can get parts for these! blades cords ext. So its saving you on machine replacement, saving the wear and tear on razor blades, and proven durability why would you spend $30 on another cheep one?</li>
    <li> They were great the first few times i used them, but one time when i was cleaning them, they literally caught fire in my hand! So i dropped them, unplugged them and made sure the fire was and contacted the seller, that was a few weeks ago,i still haven&#x27;t heard from anyone, so my advice is, i will more than likely buy them again, not from this seller, and you shouldn&#x27;t either!!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about 2 years now and they work great! I recently replaced the blades for about $10 with the Wahl Professional 2 Hole Balding Clipper Blade 2105. Buy this clipper and you won&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get you any closer than a regular set of clippers. It is however a nice size and easy to handle</li>
    <li> Love these clippers. These clippers are the next best thing to a razor. I have used many clippers to bald my head and these are by far the best.</li>
    <li> Good clean cut.  nice adjustable attachments.  Very tight shave!  Good quality, recommend to others.  Don&#x27;t forget the oil.  I no longer go to the barber and my 9 year old can cut my hair...</li>
    <li> If you want to be bald...this will do the trick...of course its not like shaving, but these clippers ROCK!!!  Booya!!!</li>
    <li> I have owned many pairs of Wahl clippers over the last 20 years.  These are the best ones yet.  I agree with one of the reviewers that the blades are very sharp, so be careful.  But, who wants to cut their hair with dull clippers anyway.      The clippers were reasonably priced and shipping was lightning fast.  It seems that all of the Wahl guards from the other pairs of clippers I have owned in the past still work with these.  Keep up the good work Wahl.</li>
    <li> very good just dont use on ur pubes</li>
    <li> I normally use the Headshaver Razor to shave my head.  It works great with a day or two of hair growth.  But if I go a week or more without shaving my head the razor gets bogged down easily.  I purchased these clippers to knock down the extended growth before hopping in the shower to finish the job with my razor.  I DID use it to shave my head after a 2 weeks worth of hair growth.  The cut was even and pretty close (felt like a days worth of hair growth after a razor shave).  It just took me a LONG time making sure I had gotten to every part of my head.  Sure it will go quicker the more I practice.  I read a lot of reviews about how sharp these clippers were and the cuts some reviewers had suffered.  Probably another reason it took me so long to shave my head, as I proceeded slowly and cautiously when using these for the first time.  Frankly, I think the warnings were overblown.  I go along at a very good clip (pun intended) know that I am accustomed to this device and haven&#x27;t drawn blood once.  This clipper looks and feels sturdy and well made.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had time to use this clipper made by Wahl and it works as advertized and described by Amazon. The clipper blades are not as sharp as many reviews claim and do not cut into the skin. It does not shave the head, it cuts the hair to as bald as a clipper can. It is very easy to use solo and takes about 2 min. My experience with the product tells me that many of the reviews are by users who did not read the instruction manual. I highly recommend this clipper for those who like me want to cut their own hair to zero.</li>
    <li> For longer than I care to admit I was cutting my own hair with an Andis Outliner.  This process often took me more than an hour because I had to take regular 15 minute breaks to let the thing cool off.  I know that the Outliner was not designed to cut my whole head but I was getting by.  Thank Wahl for the Balding Clipper!  This machine is built for what I was trying to force my Outliner to do.  It takes your hair all the way to the stubble.  Not completely bald.  Does what I need in about 15 minutes.  Pays for itself in about 2 haircuts.</li>
    <li> Cuts very close.  Quiet, sharp.  My second set of Wahl clippers.  (I keep a set at each house) Nice product!</li>
    <li> This Wahi Professional 8110 5 clipper is the worse clipper I have ever bought.  This clipper without the attachments on will cut you. This clipper is so sharp it is no good for what I purchased it for. I bought this clipper so I good shave my body. I am a bald guy so I have more hair on my body then I have on my head. Bald guys no exactjy what I am talking about. Just letting you no this clipper cuts and I dont recommend it to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t like the name of this clipper, it describes me -- I am going bald after all. So rather than wrestle with a combover or other special effects that fools like Donald Trump do, I buzzed my off. Now, I look terrible with a buzzcut, but it is nothing but full of win-win for me. The main difference is that this clipper has much finer clipper blade teeth. They&#x27;re sharp, but I&#x27;ve had much sharper, and I don&#x27;t fear cutting myself. But the fine teeth and edge allow you to draw sharper lines around your ears and neckline, eliminate the need for a second trimming clipper, and it makes it very efficient at cutting short hair. If you are cutting yourself, YOU&#x27;RE DOING IT WRONG! Don&#x27;t apply as much pressure to your skin. Unfortunately, the kit only comes with two short cutting guides, and that&#x27;s not enough. Other than that, I highly recommend this clipper.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews warning about being cut we decided to buy them anyway.  He loves them.  What used to take 20 mins to shave his head not takes 10 minutes. He gets a nice close shave without cuts.</li>
    <li> Good  fast services excellent product</li>
    <li> was a pleasure dealing with amazon as always these clippers are awesome i love them and transaction and everything went smooth as always and was delivered in appropiate timeframe.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great, but they are really sharp and I have cut myself several times while shaving. They work, they really do, but I wish they came with a warning on how to use them.</li>
    <li> After using a \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; clipper for several years I wanted something which would cut my hair shorter.  I do not use attachments on my clippers and the only thing I use them for is getting my hair as short as possible.  While searching for that perfect pair of balding clippers I read a few reviews about these 5-star series leaving nicks and such on people&#x27;s heads during the shaving process.  I ultimately settled on this pair after realizing I do not have any bumps, moles, etc. on my head which would warrant an overriding concern.  These appear to be a very nice quality - solidly built and really feel like a bargain for the price.  I used them right away and did not experience any problems with cuts or nicks.  I heeded the advice of other&#x27;s and took my time - especially around the ears.  I didn&#x27;t push down excessively hard and was very happy with the results.  These do indeed get closer than any \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; set of clippers (at least that I&#x27;ve used) and are easier for me than using a razor.  One caveat to keep in mind is not to expect these to give equal results of a razor blade.  While these cut as close as possible for clippers they do not leave a smooth, hair-free appearance; more along the lines of several days of growth after a shave - which is fine by me because I didn&#x27;t expect more.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son-inlaw for his birthday an he loved it  the second he seen it when he opened it up, infact couldnt wait to use it an he did.</li>
    <li> These clippers do just what they say; just as close as one-day growth. No scalp irritation, no bumps, no nicks. Care accordingly and it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Does the trick for my bald head!  Cheaper to clean shave than razors - but not as close, but who cares!</li>
    <li> When searching for new clippers I was almost scared away from this product by a few people who claimed it was too sharp and cut them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I don&#x27;t know what the heck these people are doing.  I&#x27;m borderline clumsy and have had absolutely no problems with these fantastic clippers.  Yes, they are sharp. With the exception of a razor, you won&#x27;t get a closer cut.  The only area you have to be a bit more careful around is your ears.  They do get hot.  Not a big deal.  They are heavy.  Also not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***also want to mention that I haven&#x27;t experienced that loud noise that some people have complained of</li>
    <li> Wow, do these clippers cut close.  So close that if you are not careful you can easily cut your head. I did the first time I cut my hair.  If you want a not quite bald cut these work great.  Maybe a 2-3 days after razor shaving look.  They are not the closest or the best clippers, but at less the half the cost of salon or barber shop clippers they work amazing.</li>
    <li> Finally a clipper that cuts through everything! My head literally looks like I shaved it with a razorblade!</li>
    <li> Ignore the one star reviews. I admit I was a little nervous since I cut my own hair after reading some.of the reviews about mangling your head. Soon as I got them I opened them and cut my hair with no attachment, not a single nick or cut just the closest to razor bald your ever gonna get with clippers. Highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> I used to buzz, then shave my head. With this it cuts the time and steps in half. Cuts as closer as a razer</li>
    <li> I have so far only used this clipper once for grooming my dogs.  I was impressed by how easily it cut through hair.  It is a bit heavy and a bit loud as are most good clippers.  I used it for about 40 minutes continuously without arm or hand fatigue from weight and vibration.  Overheating was not a factor either.  The attachments worked well.  All in all, I have no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Great service.</li>
    <li> These clippers are the trick. Started losing my hair so I have decided to just go bald. I shave once every 2 weeks and these are great. I have already used it 3 times and have got my money back that I would have lost going to a barber.</li>
    <li> The clippers scratched my scalp. I will more than likely never use them again.......They were delivered as promised and did the job; gave me a close cut. However, I suffered scratches all over my head that took days to heal.</li>
    <li> This is the machine I&#x27;ve been looking for all my life! Cuts my hair really low. It works great! Really worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are my third set of clippers. I have been using Wahl Balding clippers since 1996. I have tried others but with no success. I have gotten about 7 years use from each, give or take a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple Wahl hair clippers before but this is my first experience with a balding shaver.  Let me warn you, it takes some getting used to using it so be careful.  The first time I used it my head was cut up and bloody since I was used to using the other clippers but after using it a few times it&#x27;s much better and works great.  No more cuts and bleeding ust a smooth cut.  I love the end result which is an almost shaved head with very short stubble.  Wahl makes great products and this is one of their best.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable how sharp these are. Be careful, they could cut you! I would possibly even have a real barber tune these for you. They get THAT close. I have to give them 5 stars because they are very true to their word and have a quality build.</li>
    <li> Very good little clipper. It&#x27;s got a powerful electric motor that almost scares you when you turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;Saves you 20 bucks in barber visits once you get the hang of wielding it on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;*Very sharp blades; not good for cutting your own hair without the included cutting guides.&lt;br /&gt;*Requires regular cleaning and Oiling, just like any other decent clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wahl Professional 785110</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. After reading the reviews and tips from some people about how sharp the blade is, I still didn&#x27;t listen. If it&#x27;s not flat on your head, they will cut the hell out of you and leave major razor burn. Over all, this is the look I wanted and it was way less work than using a bic. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> after a month of use the blade is not sharp any longer. and it gets caught in the hair and makes a weird noise. then u have to turn the screw on the side..  annoying!!</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does.  They are a balding clipper.  No cuts, burns, or anything else that some people claim.  It has worked great.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers, very sharp and powerful.  included a 1.5 size guard which is nice.  you will not regret buying these clippers!</li>
    <li> Found these bad boys one day while browsing through Amazon! I liked what I saw and the price was affordable, but I needed to see if there were any reviews and what the overall consensus was on these clippers. Came across a large number of reviews, for the most part praising the product and so I went ahead and picked up myself a pair! BEST MOVE I&#x27;VE EVER DID. These clippers are a finely tuned instrument of hair cutting. No pulling or ripping, just an even, smooth close cut! I&#x27;ve been cutting my own head for awhile now and have been through my share of $19.99 clippers, so this time I did some research, look up on a few pairs and, \\&quot;the Wahl Balding Clipper\\&quot; is all that one needs! This is a professional barber&#x27;s clipper and it does it&#x27;s job accordingly with speed and acuracy, gotta give it up, the 8110 5 Star Series is the way to go...the best clippers out there!!!</li>
    <li> These clippers were shipped quickly and in good condition.  My husband is in the Military and gets weekly haircuts which can get expensive.  We now use these clippers to trim his hair ourselves and have saved a ton of money!</li>
    <li> I have owned several Wahl clippers and this one is the best. I don&#x27;t use it for balding hairstyle shaves, but it works well for personal grooming. The blades are smaller, finer &amp; faster than my old Wahl clippers, so there is less tendency to nick delicate skin. Use the \\&quot;0\\&quot; guard and you can trim personal areas (like underarms) without the itch associated with using a razor.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for almost 20 years and have used many different shavers. I saw this one and thought it would work well for me. It is good quality and nicely packaged. As far as actually cutting your hair it was horrible. I ended up bleeding in about six different spots! It does do a very close shave but is way too sharp. I felt like this thing was dangerous and only used it to finish the haircut because I had to. I don&#x27;t have a lumpy head and have never had this sort of issue before. I will not use this again and have ordered a different shaver. Beware!</li>
    <li> I had no idea shavers could cut so close! It feels like i used a razor sometimes! My mother was a hair stylist and used wahl products her entire career and now i use them and they have always put out a quality product. Awesome awesome trimmers.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected...very nice clean cut and easy to operate!</li>
    <li> Works well but no adjustment to blade and will cut you if you don&#x27;t use a comb.</li>
    <li> It works great, so far!!! Let&#x27;s see how long it lasts!!! But my old WAHL clippers lasted forever! Great brand!!!</li>
    <li> These clippers work excellent!! My dog has thick hair and they cut right through it. These clippers are probably the best for your money.</li>
    <li> I like my hair pretty short, so now I just trim it ultra close, then shave it bald 3 or 4 times a year, letting it grow out between each occasion. No barbers any more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a year now. It works as advertised. You get what you pay for. No over blown review here. Maybe others aren&#x27;t as good. I don&#x27;t know. That said, this one works. It&#x27;s quick, sharp and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll ever need another one.</li>
    <li> BEWARE! THESE WILL CUT YOU &amp; MAKE YOU BLEED! SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING!</li>
    <li> Liked it so much I bought another as a backup.</li>
    <li> it makes too much noise when I try to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Here in Belgium we use 220v instead of 110v.</li>
    <li> I use it for my boyfriends hair which he is bald. Doesnt cut as close as I would like. A bit heavy, but does a decent job.</li>
    <li> This product has a Wow factor. Does what it says it will do. Husband is Very glad he got it and would recommend it to others looking for a close cut</li>
    <li> I wanted a clipper that would get close to the scalp and this is it!! I won&#x27;t give you the \\&quot;Bic\\&quot; feeling but it will get you the day after \\&quot;bic\\&quot; feeling. They are easy to clean after use, not loud and come with all that you would need to shave your head or your friends heads. Perfect for those Devil Dog&#x27;s out there that want to go with Barracks cuts vs going out in town and paying 15 bucks for a cut, screw em&#x27; buy these and put them out of business. I&#x27;ve had many clippers in my day and these are hands down the best one&#x27;s so far and for the price it&#x27;s a win win all the way around!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yut Yut!!!</li>
    <li> Another high quality item from Wahl</li>
    <li> Unless I go on post to get my haircut, telling the barber &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; results in a mere trim.  We have owned several cheap clippers over the years, and even they leave quite a bit of hair.  This is the only one we&#x27;ve used at home that really goes skin-tight.  No cuts, either.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Finally!  A clipper that gives my patients a surgically close shave and isn&#x27;t so loud it scares the patient!  Very nice.  All that and a pretty color too.  :-)</li>
    <li> The clippers definitely get bare skin close to the scalp... i keep the hair i have left below a 1/4 inch and when I tilted he clippers to go over the curve of the back of my head wow! felt like i got bit by a sharped tooth cat. so if youre going to buy these clippers beware of that but if you have &amp;#34;someone&amp;#34; to cut it for you it will be a great purchase... the back of my head needed a tourniquet after my first use....</li>
    <li> Holy hell, why didn&#x27;t I upgrade from my 5 year old Wahl hair cutting clipper 4 years ago? This one gives a clean, tight shave, does NOT nick my head as my old clipper used to, does not require constant blade adjustments and does the job in half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. people who are beotching about nicking their head need to either learn to shave or change the blade to one that fits them best. This is a great shaving machine.</li>
    <li> This purchase started off on a positive note.  After placing the order I discovered that the seller did not offer rush delivery and after contacting them directly they shipped it within my time period. The clipper, is as advertised. It is effective, efficient and the reduction in the noise level is pleasing to the ears. My hair grows very quickly and as such I have to cut it twice a week, if I want to maintain the bald look and time spent in accomplishing this is now reduced by 5 minutes a session.</li>
    <li> I have been using Balding Clippers for many years now and this pair works great like all the rest do.&lt;br /&gt;Good Clippers and easy to use too....</li>
    <li> I bought these because my old pair broke after about 4yrs. These give you a great cut that is very short, but not bald like razor. this is just what I wanted. I cut my hair 1 to 2 times a week and never have a problem with them. they don&#x27;t get hot and I have never nicked myself with them. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> I have read a lot of reviews for this product, and I am not convinced the people posting reviews have all used these clippers. I have been cutting hair for 20 years, and this is the first set of balding clippers I have ever purchased (never really had a need). First and foremost,these clippers are very sharp, and if you are not careful, you will put deep gashes in your skin! If you have bumps or moles on your scalp, these clippers will surely slice right through them. That being the case, of course, these clippers also cut hair very well, as they should. Wahl makes excellent, long lasting clippers. As I said, I have been cutting hair for 20 years and these clippers really aren&#x27;t for amateurs or do-it-yourself head shaving. If you&#x27;re using them to cut your hair, or the hair of someone else, take your time, keep the top, flat portion of the blades flush with the person&#x27;s scalp (to minimize cuts), and be very careful around the ears. Second, for men that wear do-it-youself, clean-shaved heads, these clippers are not a good alternative to shaving your head with razors. Try an electric razor (like Norelco) instead, and then clean up the straggler hairs with a razor. Otherwise, as I said, be very careful!</li>
    <li> My hubby hasn&#x27;t had the chance to use these clipper yet since I just got them for him as an anniversary gift. However, he was happy to receive them an commented on how professional the look. So I think that he would love them when he gets a chance to use them.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time today and if I could I would give it more stars. In the last 10 years I have used 5 different clippers, from Conair, Remington, and even Wahl... all I can say is I have finally found the best hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure if ordering online would be a good idea, especially after reading other reviews saying the blades were too sharp and guys were cutting their head and ears. All I can say is that in my case, I received a brand new product and once I used it I had absolutely NO cuts and NO pulls whatsoever and I did it in half the time.&lt;br /&gt;If you want the best price for a professional balding clipper, just get this one.</li>
    <li> The item was missings parts and had been oiled by someone prior to receipt. It was a gift and I have never given anyone one a used gift until now. I will not use this vendor again and would not recoment them. Return and replacement would seem to have been offered immediated by the vendor but neither was offered. I am still awaiting a written response.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about 2 months now. They work fine just like my last set. I don&#x27;t like the heavy vibration on these Wahl clippers, but they are the only ones I can find that have a 1/16 guard. The guards will eventually become loose and not stay on. My last set lasted about a year which is good for the price.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time. I recently tried it and I broke out all over my head.  This is not my first purchase of this product. It was thoroughly cleaned.</li>
    <li> This set of clippers was fulfilled by Amazon through Prime. I received the clipper in a used state with white hair and dead skin cells on it. I am attaching a picture of what the clipper blades look like after a failed attempt at cleaning them.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair at least once every 2 weeks. I had previously owned a standard Wahl clipper for 10+ years before purchasing this one. How did I keep it running for so long?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Always keep it oiled. I oiled the clippers before and after I cut my hair&lt;br /&gt;2. Brush off the hairs on the clipper after you are done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to keep my old Wahl clipper for more than 10 years by following those 2 rules. The motor finally died after exactly 13 years. I expect this clipper to last just as long and if not longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guards/guides from the old Wahl clipper fits on this version. It must be a standard size for most clippers. This one does come with a number 0 (long 0 at 1/16 inches) and a number 2 clip (3/16 inches). I still use the number 1 guard that came from my original/old Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing cuts as smooth as butter. As the previous poster noted, yes it is sharp. That is why it cuts so well. With any sharp object, you got to be careful that you&#x27;re not stabbing yourself or anyone with it. It&#x27;s common sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B000VVT94G Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper]] is well worth the money. If you take care of it, it will last a very long time. The most important part is to keep it oiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I also use these to trim my pubes. Make sure to always use a guard when you are doing so because you can easily cut your balls and it will not stop bleeding after a long time. Trust me I know. Use a clip and take your time.</li>
    <li> These are the best pair op clippers that I have ever owned.  I have thick hair and the last pair would sometimes get bogged down but these cut great.  No pulling and very close with no guard.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous because of some of the negative reviews which claimed these may cut into the skin. I used the clippers for the first time last night and they worked fabulously. I was no more careful than I have been with previous regular Wahl clippers which I have owned. They cut my hair beautifully. They felt like they were gliding over my head and I was very pleased with the result. Thoroughly recommended!!</li>
    <li> this is a head gouger. so sharp. I do not recommend for most people. I CANT USE IT WITHOUT A BLADE ATTACHMENT OR I CUT MY HEAD.  (my personal opinion)</li>
    <li> I used the 1/2 guard and it worked a million times better than the Andis Pivot Motor I purchased for more money.  This was a powerful smooth shave.  Didnt hurt my head like the Andis since it was much more powerful.  Took half the time.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend cant stop praising this balding clipper. Balding his head took 30 mins with his previous trimmer, now the job can be completed in 3 mins. He did say its sharp and one must be careful.</li>
    <li> Very close shave! This item does what it says it will do. Be care as you can cut yourself however. I should have purchased 2 of these.</li>
    <li> The machine is great and I&#x27;m using to shave my head and beard , it give me the look that I get with the razor and with better shape . its not sharp if you use it at the right angle as other review are saying , the only downside that I&#x27;m giving it 4 star is that it work only with 110 V power supply and I&#x27;m moving too much and I wish if there is an edition that work with 240 V as alot of shaving machine do.</li>
    <li> Good to use if you let your hair grow over 7-10 days to get it to a length you can shave it.  Tends to be pretty rough on the scalp, also hard to get some spots.  Spend the extra money and go with the Bald Eagle Smart, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I have had this for over a year now and would never buy anything else. I feel that its the cleanest closest shave i have every had. (i&#x27;ve had many). None work the way this does. Not loud sounding and easy to clean with the brush given. Only thing i wish it came with was a case. I would pay a little more for a nice case.</li>
    <li> These clippers are sturdy and quiet and have a nice feel to them. I&#x27;ve used them a few times and so far like them much better than the Wahl Designer I had. Hopefully it will last a long time because I like it. I bought the separate guards set (the one with a lot of color guards) and think it&#x27;s a  good thing to have in your salon or home if you like cutting hair or doing fades.</li>
    <li> I love a close haircut, and that&#x27;s what this product delivers. I have used it with and without the attachments and it works perfectly either way. Reviews complaining about these clippers cutting through skin seem incredible- I just don&#x27;t see how it could happen. My only question is why Wahl would include a comb with clippers called &amp;#34;Balding&amp;#34;, and presumably designed for guys who don&#x27;t need combs :-P</li>
    <li> it definitely cuts the hair to the skin. Very nice and smooth. It&#x27;s not razor shave smooth but close enough. Saves me a lot of money to cut my own hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He&#x27;s been shaving his head for years with no issues.  These things are not for use on your own head.  They cut him several time and left razor burn on his head in several places.  He didn&#x27;t even finish one haircut and finished with a regular razor which proved much safer.  These are for barbers to use on their customers.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor if you use the attachments with it but DO NOT USE WITHOUT THE ATTACHMENTS!!! It cuts your bare skin.  Other then that it&#x27;s a great razor!</li>
    <li> These clippers cut very close to the scalp as advertised.  The clippers are very well constructed and feel as heavy/durable as a more expensive industrial build. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for over 5 years now with other clippers (Andis &amp; Conair), and this balding clipper does a really good job. I would warn that it is VERY sharp; It is easy to have nicks and cuts all over your head. Just don&#x27;t shave against the grain of your hair, or you might get bumps all over your head!!  It leaves a shadow of your hair. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to get a really close shave without a razor.  Update 6 years later: I recently replaced the blades on my 6 year old clipper and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this clipper. The shave is still as close as you will get without using a razor. This is perfect for me because I get bumps if I use razors. I have learnt how to use it now, especially when the blades are new. I would recommend the following tips when using this hair clipper: 1. Do not shave against the grain of your hair, otherwise you will likely get bumps. 2. Hold it a 45-60 degree angle against your scalp, to minimize cuts and nick&#x27;s to your scalp. 3. Shave your head in sections - so that you are sure you are done with one section before moving to another - This helps me save time.  It as paid for itself many, many times over.</li>
    <li> After I got it, I finished my hair cut in 10 minutes. I used to have a no brand clipper and the cutting guide &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; fit, so I used that.&lt;br /&gt;Though the teeth are short, they cut efficiently without pulling. I haven&#x27;t used it to shave my head yet, but tempted.&lt;br /&gt;It feels sturdy, sounds powerful but not annoyingly loud. I am not sure it is louder than my previous clipper.&lt;br /&gt;The teeth or pressure are not adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why some people said it might cut skin. Reading those reviews, I was very careful when opening the box, I thought the teeth were razor thin; but there is a height.&lt;br /&gt;I found it is not dangerous at all, even when I tilted it and poke my palm with a little pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I love it. Hope it can last long.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a japanese brand; It is clunky, heavy, loud and when you flip the chunky on-switch, you feel as though the power will go out in a small town close by. But it CUTS YOUR HAIR!! WELL! I don&#x27;t want any fancy cuts, just very short all over, and it does just that, without any complaints and without breaking a sweat. Yes, it&#x27;s loud. So sing as you shave! Yes, it&#x27;s heavy! Oh, I&#x27;m sorry, maybe ask your daughter to hold it for you, intermittently, so you can rest your poor arms...! These are silly complaints; It&#x27;s built to last, does what it should, and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg; what more do you want?! Well, actually, a longer setting for my beard and moustache, would be nice..</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews posted about these clippers I was reticent buying them. But since I could return them I said, &amp;#34;What the heck&amp;#34;. Well, I was very happy with them. I have used them four or five times and the results are far better then I ever expected. They leave the equivalent of a 24 hour growth, which is about as good as one can expect. This is the look that I was hoping for. These clippers are EXTREMELY sharp and if you don &#x27;t know how to properly use them, they will eat your head.....when you get them, you need to check the gap between the cutters and the stationary blade, the cutters CANNOT GO BEYOND the stationary blade, if they do you will cut yourself badly. Also make sure they don&#x27;t move beyond the stationary blade, right to left. When you use them make sure you hold them level to your scalp, not at an angle. Make sure you use the blade lubricant. I can recommend using the Wahl 3772 spray, it is expensive but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my hair with a buzzer/clipper weekly for the past 17 years. Usually I use a Wahl with no clip then a razor to get down to skin.  Basically it&#x27;s not my first rodeo. When I saw this \\&quot;Balding\\&quot; clipper I thought it would work well for when I don&#x27;t have time to shave. I read some of the reviews complaining about how sharp it is and how it cuts skin and thought \\&quot;Bagh! These folks are amateurs. My head is seasoned and I&#x27;ve been doing this for years. How bad could it be....\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well as I sit at my computer, head burning and bleeding, I say to the fine, soon to be bald, people of the world.... Pass on this one. It&#x27;s ridiculously sharp! I could honestly say that it would have been more comfortable to shave with my hunting knife... dry... with a sunburn... and a pit bull chewing on my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You have to keep it totally flat to prevent it from chewing through you skin. If you&#x27;re like me and have fat rolls on the back of your head, you know... it looks like a pack of hot dogs, you will hurt yourself with these clippers. You will also end up with some parts being down to raw skin and some spots covered in stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll just keep it and use it with the clip that came with it to prevent the throbbing, hot, bloody meatball aftermath that is currently my head.</li>
    <li> I bought the clippers at a store, not from Amazon, but thought I should let people know what I think.  First off, it has a very professional feel to it. Has some weight, unlike the one you buy at a drug store. They are sharp, but I only used them with the 1/16th clip it came with, and I was amazed at how sharp it is. I also used it to clean up my neck area, and it didn&#x27;t cut me up, like some of the reviews stated, but then again, I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;hot dogs\\&quot;. Only downside I saw is that it didn&#x27;t come with more clips (I could use a 1/8th one)...so you have what you have. I didn&#x27;t see anyway to adjust the blade not to be so close. Since I just got it, I will be playing around with it, but it is impressive. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the 3/16th clip it comes with isn&#x27;t that good. It made stripes in my head.</li>
    <li> Great purchace. Came fast 2!</li>
    <li> I have never had razor burn on my scalp before. This thing will chew your head up. Run as far away as possible.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever purchased.  They cut perfectly every time. I  received the pur chase in a timely fashion</li>
    <li> My last pair lasted over 8 years. Only reason I had to replace them was because I fried my others in Ireland plugging them into the outlet without a convertor.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 6yr old so he could have some style to his haircut. My barber kept exclaiming as he used it and then made sure to find out where I got these so he could get one for his shop.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers, for shaving my head. However if you want it close without stubble you will have to do some addition shaving with an electric shaver or hand razor. I would buy again just because sometimes you don&#x27;t need it close and works fine for example during the week.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come close to cutting close enough for someone with a bald head.  In fact, it didn&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
    <li> Super sharp, I am so impressed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for over a month and find them easy to use. They remove all hair from my scalp evenly and effortlessly almost always in one pass. and never leave a burn, nick, or red spots. I highly recommend this for shaving heads and neck lines. I follow up with the bump free shaver and my head is smooth and never burned</li>
    <li> I do a lot of razor fades via machine because some people are scared of the straight razor shave lol but was so satisfied to see that this has saved my machines from dulling the order was packaged to a tee came in flawless condition and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Gives a good close cut for a clipper.</li>
    <li> I got the item, I followed the instructions, and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what people are doing to cut themselves with it in some of the other reviews...  All I would say is follow the instructions and use common sense (like don&#x27;t adjust the blade too low so it&#x27;s ahead of the guard?  only thing I can think can happen to let it cut you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I chose to purchase this Clipper</li>
    <li> These are the cheaped down version sold at Sally Beauty supply ....the head is fixed and and the clipper head will cut and scrape the living hell out of you if you are not careful..I have bought the cheap dog clippers that were better than these...The have the motor adjustment screw on the side 90% of all pro clippers don&#x27;t have this and don&#x27;t need it...I&#x27;m deployed I can&#x27;t send them back...</li>
    <li> These clippers cut shorter than any other I have tried. The only problem I have had is that they cut so close, they sometimes nick the skin.</li>
    <li> This clipper ousam at all very sharp, zero cutting and easy grip</li>
    <li> The best clippers I&#x27;ve owned. If you don&#x27;t want to be bald but as close as possible to being bald, then these are the clippers to get.</li>
    <li> Very hard to review this item.  I planned on using it to shave my head and trim up the facial hair.  Using it on my beard was an absolute disaster.  It felt like someone was yanking each hair out one by one.  Needless to say this is not what I had in mind.  On the head it was still not a pleasant experience but it does do a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Before you use check the blades from the side and make sure that the cutting blade isn&#x27;t poking ahead of the guard blade because it will cut you. The ones that I got were a lil off so I test them on my arm and cut me a lil so I adjusted them and man the best bald cut really strong machine cuts the first time. By the way if you don&#x27;t know how to adjust look it up on YouTube it&#x27;s really easy just need a screwdriver and flat surface.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for 15 years or so, using cheap clippers purchased at Target and the like. I finally broke down and spent the money for the Wahl 5 star balding clippers. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I highly recommend these to anyone who shaves their head. The blades are super sharp and give you a close cut, almost razor-like. It also takes me half the time to cut my hair because I no longer have to go over the same spots like cheaper clippers sometimes require. If you shave your head with clippers, spend the extra money and buy these.</li>
    <li> After having a difficult time with the $45 Andis SpeedMaster 2, I decided to try my luck with the Wahl Professional 8110 Balding Clipper, and boy was I impressed!  I&#x27;ve owned a sub-$40 Wahl clipper for years, and it was due time for an upgrade.  The adjustment clips were starting to wear out, and (even with proper maintenance) the clipper was losing its \\&quot;edge\\&quot;.  I had been using my clipper to buzz my head, and it did a fairly decent job.  But it would heat up, and take several passes more than a clipper should.  The Andis SpeedMaster 2 was my first replacement attempt.  It&#x27;s been touted for its excellent value and versatility.  Even with its ceramic blade, it would heat up even more than my former Wahl.  It required even more passes as well!  Furthermore, the device would not cut hair even close to its advertised shortness of 1/100 in.  RETURNED!  Enter the Wahl Professional 8110 Balding Clipper.  After some helpful forewarning by other reviewers, I adjusted the blades prior to my first cut-- just a hair away from zero.  I&#x27;ve never had a closer trim, and no blood yet!  I have even used it to trim around my ears, and no nicks!  No heat issues, and no skin irritation.  However, I did end up with a few ingrown hairs on the back of my neck a few days later.  I will probably need to adjust the blades just a hair more, and sacrifice a closer shave for the benefit of my sensitive skin.  I definitely couldn&#x27;t fault the equipment for that.  All in all, $40 extremely well spent!</li>
    <li> These clippers cut really well. I personally like my hair the shorter the better, and these are about as close to bald as your going to get with clippers. A warning for anyone looking to purchase though, these clippers are very sharp, I underestimated these my first time using them and applied a little too much pressure on the right side of my head, it was really red and irritated for a couple hours.</li>
    <li> For those who want an extremely close trim (a la razor blade) but do not actually want to use a razor, then this is the solution for you!  Great product at an attractive price - solid construction, works quickly and somewhat effortlessly.  I wish I found this clipper a long time ago!!! Very satisfied...</li>
    <li> Hello All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from Amazon about 7 months ago when my Norelco G370 Grooming system broke. I shave my head every week and a good balder is very helpful. Norelco trimmer did a god job but was very flimsy and it broke from inside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Wahl&#x27;s after reading the review. The product is pretty solid and its powerful, wide clipper makes balding faster and easier. The issue is with the cuts. I keep cutting myself near the chin and under the neck. I have tried adjusting the gap b/n the blades which has reduced the cuts but has lot eliminated it fully. I never had these problems with Norelco. The baldes need regular oiling unlike Norelco. Also, it works only with the cord and on 120V supply. Not for globe trotters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Norelco QC5550 today. I will keep you all posted of the results.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Very useful for a hairy man like me! strong motor and sharp blade. I hope it stays like this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for several years now and they work great.  Use them to shave my head.  I still haven&#x27;t had to change the blade.  Keep in mind I clean and oil them after every use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in the military for 17 yrs now. I&#x27;ve tried every hair clipper out there trying to get the closest bald cut without having to shave. I bought the Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper even though I was a bit skeptical. This thing is the BOMB!!  The closest you&#x27;ll ever get to shaving your head.  Don&#x27;t hesitate. This is the real deal!</li>
    <li> These are great! I&#x27;ve been using clippers for 20 years for trimming beard and head. These are great!!! Be gentle or you will draw some blood. I saw a lot of reviews warning you will cut your ears off... Just be gentle, if you jam them into your ear, nose, or any other parts they will cut you. Never used a set of clippers that wouldn&#x27;t cut you if your not careful.</li>
    <li> Pretty damn happy, I would definitely recommend these clippers just be careful if anything they cut too close sometimes and you end up cutting yourself a tiny bit but very happy with them</li>
    <li> Cuts easily, a bit heavy, seems powerful.</li>
    <li> this one is worth it. i would recommend my friend about this product.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. Boyfriend shaves his head down to the wood and this thing gets a very close shave for being electric. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very afforable, good to use if doing bald fades or tapers. satisfied with the purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to all barbers out there.</li>
    <li> I finally got what I have always wanted in a clipper. What a great product! I bought a Andis promotor clipper few months before this wahl balding clippers but never enjoyed it. The Wahl balding clipper works great and gives me great satisfaction. I will go for it again and again. It glides smoothly on my scalp and gives  me the kind of hair cut I desire.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it did not come with height attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s great for buzz cuts and extremely fast.  Perfect for the summer.</li>
    <li> I use it to shave my head without any guides.  Man this thing can cut close!  Once in a while i cut the pimples on my head and make it bleed.  Not enough to make it bleed profusely.  Sometimes it just gets caught and snags on my scalp or hair stubs but never got cut yet.. I have to be careful when shaving my head now.  Sometimes i miss those cheap buzzers bc then i dont have to be so careful but they dont get as close.  This thing has some weight to it and you can feel the quality.  Seems like this buzzer will be the last one ill ever buy.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is excellent and worth the $$$. If you like a VERY close buzz, then this trimmer is for you. Other reviewers had said the unit is very loud; aside from the initial turn on I did not notice this at all. And when used properly (at an angle to head) I did not experience any nicks or cuts of any kind; very smooth/clean trimming. This is also very good for trimming down a few-days-old facial growth before shaving. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice little gadget to have. It shaves as close a possible without, at least in my case, shaving off skin along with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Very substantial, quality feel. Looks and feels like it was not designed to be cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My side hair is very thick, and has bogged down many lesser models to the point they were pulling my hair out, not shaving it. Not with this one. Almost startling how nice this thing does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Very sharp and close blades that shave so close to your head, if it worked any better, you&#x27;d be in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Not overly noisy. It is what it is, a reasonably powerful electric Razor. But noise levels never were uncomfortable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Since it does shave so close, expect a little Razor burn after first use. It did not make me bleed, but my skin was on fire after the first use. But results were impressive. After a few uses and experience, things should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Not much oil supplied in original package. Warns you to use Wahl oil only. I am not so sure, I have always used general purpose 3-In-One type oil for any razors I have owned in the past and I always got my 3 years or so worth out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: If this is the look you are going for, make the purchase. Just use with care until you are adjusted to how powerful this product is. Like I said, it never made me bleed, but I can see how the unwary could lose a tad bit of skull skin if they fire it up and just dig right in. Use with care at first and you will be okay.</li>
    <li> When you go to the barber for a skin fade they use the same type of clipper.. Notice how they are very careful not to apply too much pressure, use a very small angle and tend not to go over the same spot more than twice. Same thing applies when you use it.. First time I used it my skin was really irritated because I applied way too much pressure and over the same spots over and over. I wised up and recalled how the barber did it and the second time I used it I got very minimal irritation. Always clean a keep this clipper oiled up. This thing is SUPER SHARP.. Awesome clipper!! Get it now!!</li>
    <li> Beware the warnings other people posted.  This razor is really sharp. 0 to bald in 15 seconds.</li>
    <li> cuts very well, not noisy overall awesom purchse, wish I got these along time ago! Everything I was looking for....</li>
    <li> quality,quality,quality</li>
    <li> I am a hair stylist and these are my favorite clippers.  Not too heavy.  I have had these clippers for 2 years and still no problem.... Everyone must try</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review things on here unless they&#x27;re excessively horrible or excessively awesome: these clippers are the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like a shaved head, but not a shiny razor-shaved head. I was using some basic cheapo clippers for the past few years, and sure, they got the job done. But knowing that my life will be spent shaving my head (thank genetics for balding), I decided to dive in and get a set of &amp;#34;fancy clippers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bad boys do the job quick and easy. I use the 1/16&amp;#34; attachment. I have a close cut, and it was done without any struggle. These clippers are absolutely phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, as I&#x27;ve heard they could cause injury if you&#x27;re using them while intoxicated and/or while riding in a vehicle down a bumpy road. Definitely don&#x27;t use them in those situations, as you might get small cuts on your head, and we all know no one wants that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re balding: first of all, OWN IT AND SHAVE IT... Secondly, when you do shave it, use these clippers. They&#x27;re a dream.</li>
    <li> My andi&#x27;s t outliner broke so I bought this instead. It seems much studier than the andi&#x27;s and it is wider which is good cause I use this to shave my head. Cuts very close.</li>
    <li> If you want to shave your hair bald and fast, these are the Clippers for you. I&#x27;ve been shaving my head bald for over 20 years and these are the best Clippers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> These clippers cut my head up Andy&#x27;s T clippers are a lot better</li>
    <li> Great clippers use them twice a month great purchase and great product</li>
    <li> Bald as a baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
    <li> This thing is a monster!  I takes all the hair off in a single pass, it&#x27;s quiet, and it&#x27;s efficient.  If you want to frequently shave, this thing does the job!</li>
    <li> the clipper was amazing. It felt so gentle on my skin and still gave me a clean shave. This is the best clipper i have ever used. I definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> Well I just got my balding clippers in the mail and I&#x27;m angry with myself for not ordering them sooner! I have been shaving my head with clippers for approximately 17 years now and I have NEVER had a pair of clippers as good as these. I have literally shaved my head HUNDREDS of times. Let me save you some time and money by telling you that these are the ABSOLUTE BEST CLIPPERS I HAVE EVER USED FOR SHAVING MY HEAD. Trust me...I have bought other models of Wahl, Remington, and Oster clippers and none of them came close to these balding clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* These clippers will SAVE YOU TIME! It takes me much less time than it did with my old clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Your hair will be much shorter than you can get with ordinary clippers. I would compare the length to about a day after shaving your head with a real razor. Since your hair will be much shorter than usual you won&#x27;t have to shave your head quite as often...once again this saves you time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* These QUALITY clippers will cost you only about $10 more than most clippers. They are actually about $15 cheaper than some Oster clippers I bought that aren&#x27;t even as good as these for shaving heads. I&#x27;m not bashing Oster clippers because I also have some Wahl clippers that are inferior to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I did not get any nicks at all, which is amazing to me because I got nicks with my old Wahl clippers and they didn&#x27;t shave anywhere near as close as these do. If you get nicks please keep in mind that you can adjust the blades for a safer but slightly longer cut.  You need a phillips head screwdriver for this though. When I got my clippers I adjusted them first thing because I am used to getting nicks on my neck when I clean up the hairs there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving my head is a pain but it saves me money and time by not having to go to the barber or fiddle with some silly hairdo to get ready in the mornings. These new balding clippers from Wahl will make it MUCH easier from now on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owed 3 sets of clippers and all of them yanked my hair out instead of cutting it.  I&#x27;m lazy and let my facial hair grow to where I need clippers to trim it back before shaving.  These clippers work will either without the guards or with either of the included guards.  I recommend following the instructions to keep the blades oiled to keep the clippers in peak condition.</li>
    <li> i would recommend this clipper, it shaves closer than any clipper i&#x27;ve ever used and i don&#x27;t use razors to shave, never. one should just be careful because they will cut you right open at the lowest level because they&#x27;re so close. takes a little longer because of the closeness but it&#x27;s just what i wanted i&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Afterthe first use, my head had quite a few cuts and bruises. But after making a small adjustment to the blade position, it works fine. Not a very clean cut but it is better than using a regular hair cutting machine.</li>
    <li> This is a great item. The clippers are quiet and do not bite. I tried just about every clipper made hoping to find a clipper that cut bald without hurting my scalp and this one definitely exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Well made, very solid, professional quality. My only warning is to USE THE BLADE GUARDS (or whatever they&#x27;re called). You will definitely slice your head open if you use this bare.</li>
    <li> First time I used this this clipper it vibrated so much in my hands that I thought there was something wrong.  The second time I got a headache because it was vibrating so hard against my head.  The third time it didn&#x27;t turn on.  I took off the blades and cleaned it and then it worked.  I also found the black screw on the outside can reduce the vibrations.  The manual doesn&#x27;t say anything about the screw reducing vibrations/strength of the motor.  I use this clipper to shave my head and it does a pretty good job on the first cut but I do go back several times to get it closer/clean it up.  I will probably keep the unit b/c I&#x27;m too lazy to return it.  The company should really test the units before they go out.</li>
    <li> Works great - just as described. Wish I had purchased this years ago. This takes hair almost to the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair now for about 28yrs. In the past, I&#x27;ve always bought the cheap clippers which usually cost about $12. This time I decided to buy a better clipper. I didn&#x27;t want to buy professional clippers and spend $100 so I saw the Wahl 8110 5-star. I thought this was a good middle of the road price. I read the other reviews and heard nothing but good remarks. I bought the clippers and noticed the thick cord right away. I knew at this point I got a good clipper. All my other clippers had cheap cords. Once I used them, they cut my hair flawlessly and very smoothly. They glided across my scalp so easily and didn&#x27;t miss a hair. They never clogged up like my old ones did. I cut my hair and checked to see what I missed and I didn&#x27;t miss anything. They cut my hair right the first time with no mistakes. I am very pleased with the 8110 5-star clipper and I would definitely them to anyone tired of those cheap $12 clippers. These clippers should last a life time for me. Thanks</li>
    <li> This clipper rocks.  Built solid, easy to control and perfect for the do-it-yourself guy. It&#x27;s already paid for itself twice.</li>
    <li> Since early 2006 I have been balding my head at home with Wahl clippers costing between $15 to $35. Prior to this clipper I owned and broke 3 clippers in 6 years. They all were your typical hair clipper. They worked just like any other hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair and clean shave my beard once a week and after just one hair cut I can say this clipper is anything but you typical hair clipper. This clipper cuts lower, smoother and cleaner in one pass than any of my previous clippers could. You do not have to go over the same area again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teeth of the stationary blade on this clipper are much shorter and closer together than your typical hair clipper. You can&#x27;t get any closer unless you shaved your head with a disposable razor. The teeth do not scrape your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting down one week old facial hair is a joy with this clipper, it cuts so low that lining my goatee with a razor is must easier since the hair is lower and not as coarse as it was after trimming it down with my older clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper does no have a lever to the side to adjust the stationary blade allowing you to adjust how low you go with using the blade without a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you bald your head or use a clipper to trim body/facial hair down before finishing off with a disposable razor then this clipper is for you.</li>
    <li> Works great, cuts low.  I was worried about having my head sliced open. Just use these clippers parallel to the surface of your skin and you will be fine. Place them perpendicular and you will have problems.</li>
    <li> a good basic clipper.  You will need to periodically sharpen the blades.  Youtube has some great vids for that or you can get it done.  Part of the process for  having clippers.</li>
    <li> nice clean cut , exactly as described</li>
    <li> This thing is a beast. I&#x27;ve used it twice so fat and it cuts through my thick hair like butter. I have been using the lower Walhs $20 model and it works at the beginning very well, but this one gives it the closest to skin shave I have ever experienced. Still waiting a few more cuts to determine if it keeps the cutting the hair the same</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave completely clean, but it gets really close. It&#x27;s sharp but not overly-dangerously-so. I&#x27;m not a barber and I have no experience cutting anyone’s hair (except my own), but I find it easy to use, and it doesn&#x27;t leave razor burn (or whatever those bumps are called after one shaves with a straight razor.)  One review said that the user may cut himself/herself/oneself, which has not been an issue with me, but (not sure if this matters) I&#x27;m black male and usually keeps my hair short.</li>
    <li> Great balding clippers.  Ideal for dudes who want that post-shaven head, next day look!  Very sharp and cuts very close to scalp, so go slowly and carefully until you get the hang of using them.  Had them for a while now.  Me and my housem8s use them to give our own haircuts.  Save lots of $$ that way.  Time to order new blades for them.</li>
    <li> The Wahl 8110 is one of their better clippers, specifically designed to cut all the way to the skin. No attachments are included (it is a balding clipper) but the unit cuts quick and clean with no fuss.</li>
    <li> Works great - fast and easy. I just wish they would have had a 1/8&amp;#34; snap-on trimmer also. Just run the shaver over your bald head and remove scraggly excess hair.</li>
    <li> BE  CAREFUL!! Out of the box, the blades were adjusted to gouge (mentioned in other reviews also), where the upper moving blade is sticking out past the bottom stationary blade.  I noticed this and adjusted them before I used it.  Not that I can&#x27;t follow instructions or anything, It&#x27;s seems dangerous to ship the with the initial adjustment done so poorly.  After awhile I notice the blades drifted from my initial alignment,  I believe it&#x27;s the upper moving blade that drifted, as I was sure to secure the lower one.  Now I can&#x27;t get the alignment specified in the instructions.  So on one end it doesn&#x27;t cut any hair.  I might try opening up the holes on the bottom adjustable blade a little to see if that helps.  I can&#x27;t believe I have to make these repairs to it, in order to get it to work properly.  The return window is over for me on these for an amazon return.  I might see how much trouble it will be to get these back to Wahl.  At least I have my old clippers.  a real disappointment.</li>
    <li> Product exceeded my greatest expectation as I found the price more than fare. The picture of the product was a true representation of the products actual size and features.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting for the price to works so good. Works great!  thanks!!!!!! I will recommend this product!!  :)</li>
    <li> I use this to prepare my scalp and face before shaving- I only shave once a week. It does a great job, and cuts much closer than any other clippers I have owned. I&#x27;ve never had a problem while doing my face, but you have to be careful, because if you go too fast and don&#x27;t hold the clippers at the right angle, you can take a hunk out of your scalp. Not a huge hunk, but a hunk nevertheless. Despite this, I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> They do the job I love them!!!!!!! A little sharp at first but most clippers are at first so I recommend them COMPLETELY! !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now to take care of my BMS: Beastly Man Syndrome. It works well, but you do have to use it with care as the tips of the cutters are especially sharp. On the plus side, this thing cuts close so you don&#x27;t have to clean up as often. Recommended</li>
    <li> Strong cutting power and they usually last me a year or two but its rough on the scalp with the sharp edges.</li>
    <li> I used the clippers to give my son a buzz-cut. He has very thick curly hair, which usually gets stuck in the clippers. The Wahl clippers went through his hair with ease. No pulling or stopping. Very good buy!!!</li>
    <li> Using this clippers implies doing a close cut, &amp;#34;balding effect&amp;#34; I have purchased and used it at the beginning of the month. I found it to be &amp;#34;close for sure. But not shaved. The feel of &amp;#34;sand paper&amp;#34; which is very close is achieved. Then I would say if you want to go closer, you would need warm water and shaving cream to get the skin tight feel &amp; look. It&#x27;s a good produced. Priced for the home consumer and professional as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are going in this direction, shorter the hair the higher the maintenance. Just as you send time keeping your facial hairs short, same effort would apply to your head.</li>
    <li> I have buzzed my head for about 8 years or so. I&#x27;ve gone through several clippers over that time, and these are by far the best I&#x27;ve used. Very close cut, only closer is if you used a razor, which I have. Cuts the hair with less passes, I honestly can&#x27;t say enough about these. Perfection. Really wishing I would have gotten these sooner.</li>
    <li> Great hair clippers! Best rated balding clippers on market.</li>
    <li> it cuts really close I love itit cuts almost as close as an electric razorI give it up five star</li>
    <li> Extra sharp extremely close cutting clippers.  If you are looking for that shaved bald look without using a razor then these are the clippers you need</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head with clippers for over 10 years.I have used many different clippers. I like a very low cut so I wanted to try these out. Ouch! The points on the lower stationary blade are soo thin that they got caught in the pores on my head and pulled my skin. No Good. Bad design. The part that cuts is the side edges of the blades, so making the front tips soo thin was useless and painful. Went back to my Wahl Chrome Pro.</li>
    <li> Excellent! They are very sharp, but with a set of proper blade guides, you will have no problems.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 sets of these clippers now and both have had the same issue.  You turn them on and you hear a buzzing but the clippers are not moving.  You have to bang on them or so to eventually get them to start working. Other than that they have been good. Just wish they worked every time i wanted to use them.  Ordered them based on such positive reviews and research but i will be looking for a new set now to shave my head.</li>
    <li> Very ok n am enjoying it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving my head for years. Though I get a good result, it is really time consuming. The Balding Clipper gets right up to the skin and quickly takes off the hair. It is an excellent product. Do be careful though - if you aren&#x27;t used to shaving your head or using clippers you can nick the skin. Go slow at the beginning until you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> These clippers are excellent. I usually use clippers on my head, but I always have stubble. These clippers give a very close cut with very little stubble. BE CAREFUL the bladss are very very very sharp. You MUST have a steady hand and a soft touch.</li>
    <li> Great foar keeping balding head trimmed</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and close shaving without a nick.</li>
    <li> Super sharp. Excellent for what I needed to do!</li>
    <li> Great Product, very sharp and does the job well</li>
    <li> I only use them once a week. Have not bought two of them and both have died and I&#x27;ve had to toss them. Now need a new one and moving to another brand. When they worked they were great. They just don&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> The wahl balding is a great clipper, theres a catch... out of the box these are sharp... the trick is to keep em oiled up and they will not dissapoint!</li>
    <li> I cut my hair about once every 3 weeks. This works great. Does not tug at the hair.  I lube it up each time just to make sure.</li>
    <li> This did give me a close, bald shave.  Not as close as a razor or electric face shaver, but pretty close.  I only used it once and returned it.  Maybe it&#x27;s not for use on yourself.  I mean, maybe it is better if someone else uses it on you.  For me, it scratched the heck out of my head.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper!! I cut my hair every Friday so it saves bout $20 a week $$$. I&#x27;ve had cheaper ones from other brands and this one is way better. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like the other ones did. I only do one size and its called a balding clipper so i&#x27;m sure not this is the one used for fading!! All in all good clipper for good price!!</li>
    <li> I have had the Wahl 5 Star Balding Clippers for about a month now. They do what they are supposed to do. They shave the head quite close. They don&#x27;t get your head razor and shaving cream close, but they get it as close as you can go with clippers. It is nice to not have to shave your head constantly as you would with other clippers. I can get away with shaving my head only twice a week, I like a really close buzz. Most people could probably go a couple weeks to be honest. These clippers so far are quite durable though still new. The price was very reasonable, very reasonable. I recommend these clippers to anyone in the market for clippers.</li>
    <li> Cut up my head, blades were too sharp. Need to return this product back to sender as soon as possible</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Best to use with a shaving oil if you want to get really close.</li>
    <li> i wish they cut like trimmers/liners... My Andis trimmer actually cut nicer... they&#x27;re just much smaller so I use the balding clippers to cut it all down then the trimmers to polish it off.</li>
    <li> Glad I paid heed to anothers comments on checking the blade adjustment before use. Mine were way off out of the box and set to maim. The adjustment is simple so if your buying this little dickens you&#x27;d better check the alignment. Like I said it&#x27;s simple. When set right it should be a one or maybe two pass cut. It took a couple of nicks before I started using my fore and middle fingers of my free hand to guide the clippers. Just run them in front and your  clippers and your mind automatically will keep the blades following pretty level. It&#x27;s tough keeping things on track when working with a mirror and mirrors can lead you astray. The free hand guiding can just about rule out the need for mirrors with  a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very pleased with my first cut and very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Product failed to bald but did offer a close shave.</li>
    <li> Horrible, these clippers cut me up badly.  I have used wahl products before but this is a no go.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I went through a lot of obstacles to purchase these clippers,but I&#x27;m glad that I did so. I started balding at 18(now 23) and despise constantly using a razor or mediocre clippers, to shave my head every week. These clippers are robust and compact, something that I have been actively searching for, for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power cord is thick, about 1/3 or 1/4 inch in diameter. The housing is made out of what seems to be a high quality plastic, which is a beautiful burgundy on the front side of the clippers and black on the back. The housing seems like it will protect the internal components for the life of the clipper as long as you don&#x27;t slam it on the bathroom floor. The on/off switch being small, and at the tapered end of the clippers makes for easy one handed operation. The cutter blade is super sharp and is perfectly aligned(at least on the two models that I received). The comb blade is adjustable, but not by a simple plastic pivot, which I think is a great addition that adds to the quality of these clippers. To adjust the clippers, you just have to unscrew a Phillips screw under the side of the the comb blade and side the the comb blade on a metal rail to your desired position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How the product performs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel in the hand is great. I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;8 male and have medium glove size hands. Not too heavy but you can definitely feel the weight. I have only used this set of clippers a few times since I have just received them not long ago. With that said they have outperformed my expectations. The motor is superior to all others that I have used. The blades cut right through my hair without any hitches. The actual shave is closer than any other clipper that I have ever used. It&#x27;s not as close as a razor, but does give some stiff competition. I only have to pass over each section of my head once to get a clean shave, even though I do two just to be safe. With other clippers(cheaper and not commercial ones) I have to run them over the same spot multiple times just to get a mediocre cut. In some of the other reviews people complain about being cut by these clippers, but I have not experienced any cuts or scrapes on my head at all. The clippers do vibrate a lot compared to my other clippers, but it is not terrible, and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem. I hope these clippers will last a while because they are a pleasure to use, and because of the close shave I can go longer periods without having to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these clippers to any person who is looking for a great, high quality set of clippers for a great value that will give a close shave, or anyone wants to attach guards to these and cut longer hair as well(as I assume they would do a great job).</li>
    <li> Great clipper !!!! Cut extremely close so be careful !!!! Made the right choice . Makes my wife happy with the nice cut.</li>
    <li> Good product but it&#x27;s blade is generally painful on your skin. I hope they will improve its harshness on the skin</li>
    <li> Exactly  as described</li>
    <li> This clipper is precisely what I wanted. I keep my hair especially short so it is not worth the cost of getting a haircut.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Professional (8110) clippers did everything I expected them to. I recently shaved my head &amp; was looking for clippers that would keep my head shaved as closely as possible. These did the trick.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave cuts and scars all over your head like the second poster down on this page is trying to claim.  I&#x27;ve shaved my head for years and this product is no different than than any other shaver, no sharper.  Personally I recommend the Andis clippers because that&#x27;s what the professional barbers used, recommended to me and I think they&#x27;re better.</li>
    <li> I had an older version of the Wahl Balder that broke before buying this one.  I really liked the old one, so I was hesitant to buy this one when I found out that I could no longer purchase the older one.  This one is lighter than the previous model, but comes with more power (or so it would appear).  It performs great, making short work of shaving your head.  I&#x27;ve had it over a year now, and have no complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I needed to shave my head and get as close as I could-this shaver did the trick and then some. It was very powerful and work right away. If your looking for a fast close cut this is the clippers you need!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent and well worth the money. These clippers have paid for themselves numerous times. Would I buy them again if I broke these? Without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I wish there was some sort of guard to use with this so your cutting angle never gets too steep. Very easy to get cuts when using quickly. Paid for itself within 3 months in razors. Excellent quality, I still have 2 other Wahl clippers that have outlived their usefulness or I can&#x27;t find accessories for.</li>
    <li> not a bad price for what comes with it.  the only thing i dont like is that my cut is a bit uneven.  i use my set with no guard on the shortest setting and this set usually leaves some hairs a bit longer.  once they break in they cut a bit better, still very nice clippers.  unless you keep your hair very short like i do you should not have the same issue.  been working good with no problems for about 1 1/2 years while using at least ever other week</li>
    <li> Good clippers cuts very sharp I would recommend them if you want a close very good smooth clean cut very good clippers</li>
    <li> the besy clippers i have ever used period. cuts closest to the skin you can ever get with any other clippers.high quality product</li>
    <li> About as good as you get without going really expensive. Just make sure you clean them every few uses. Otherwise the blades get stiff and unusable.</li>
    <li> Sharp and cuts really close, not as close as a razor but close enough to look good. I had one for years and only replaced when the blades started to dull.</li>
    <li> They work really good.</li>
    <li> Beats all the rechargeable clippers we&#x27;ve had.  Nothing like good old 110 volt electrical products.</li>
    <li> The clippers work well, however the one&#x27;s I received seemed to been reboxed.  I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with that.  Overall,  the product is as advertised.</li>
    <li> Just got this yesterday.  Upon opening the box and examining, I noticed the clipper head part was not properly positioned so that the sharp upper teeth were protruding.  Ran my finger over those babies and felt how sharp they are.  I got a screwdriver and carefully aligned the heads for the minimum (1/32&amp;#34;) clearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 15 minutes to do a complete cut, going quite cautiously.  No accidents, nice close cut.  I&#x27;m quite impressed with this machine.  It has plenty of power.  It just takes some practice to get used to the feel and the technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To others who buy this clipper:  Make sure you do a careful setup and alignment before trying to use it.  I think if you attend to that step, the safety issues cease to be.  Read the whole manual, and don&#x27;t forget to oil before and after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheaper trimmers for a long time and decided to spend a little more this time. WOW! What a difference! This thing cut amazingly close and took half the time!</li>
    <li> This is a great buzzer, it gives you a super close, close as you can get buzz cut, it does not give you a bald like razor/shaved cut, leaves just a bit of stubble which is just what I was looking for, for me it&#x27;s great, love it! The unit feels nice and solid in your hand, has a nice long cord as I buzz my hair before I take a shower. Some people complain about getting nicked, I have not had that issue at all, been buzzing my own head for years and no issues with this unit, just go nice and easy and the proper angle and you&#x27;ll be fine, if you have lots of raised birth marks or scares on your head sure it might nick you but overall NOT an issue at all. Very happy I went with this unit, I just went back to corded from cordless and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the cut and performance.</li>
    <li> Clipper perform as expected. The people that are cutting their head to the point where it bleeds have probably never held a pair of clippers before.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair without problem.</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned, they do provide extremely close hair cut, it takes about 2-3 sessions to get used to them and learn how to use them. The blades are extremely sharp and need to be used with much more caution than regular clippers because you can easily cut yourself, about the motor, i&#x27;m not a barber, but I can tell but the feel and weight of the machine that the motor will last a very long time, another good thing about this clipper is that the blades don&#x27;t get hot, they do get a lil warm, but after a very prolonged use and it&#x27;s never uncomfortable. I recommend them, and for the price, you truly wont get any better.</li>
    <li> These clippers are sharp!!  Use the blade to get real close without cutting your skin.  Highly recommend them for the price.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers no more cost for razors makes my head bald and smooth</li>
    <li> Not exactly a &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; clipper, but close enough for me. Some earlier reviews said that this clipper could cut you, but it appears Wahl has addressed the issue. I never needed to adjust mine.</li>
    <li> I already got one, and it work wonder.  Shave all the way to the skin.  So I bought another one, because I love it so much.  Just in case, the one I am using will somehow stop working.  Now, I will start taking care of it.</li>
    <li> I was worried reading a previous review of someone who cut themselves up. So I purposely tried to cut my scalp and could not! All I can imagine is they became unaligned and needed adjustment. Just turn the screw with a penny or the back of the included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stubble reminds of a days growth after a close shave, just the look I like. Three drops of oil after each use while its running and these should last you for years!</li>
    <li> This clipper cuts through hair with ease and it is very smooth.  The quality feel of Wahl is there, it&#x27;s also comfortable in the hand, and the cord is heavy duty.  I took off one star on the rating because anybody using this needs to be extremely patient and not rush the haircut.  The blades cut so close that if you&#x27;re not paying attention you can get nicked.  It&#x27;s also important to check the blades to make sure they are lined up perfectly and to tighten the screws down that hold the blades together.  The owners manual shows how the blades should be aligned.  This is my second clipper from Wahl, my first still works after 6 years but I wanted to get as close to my scalp as possible, and the motor on the balding clipper seems a little more powerful too.  I didn&#x27;t get any of the problems others have had after using these, like I said, you only need to be patient and careful.</li>
    <li> Item arrived exactly had described. Cuts really close to the scalp for a clean shave. One of the best gifts I got my husband - he loves it!</li>
    <li> My wife handles my trimming and she says these are awesome and easy - I think my hair looks sharp.</li>
    <li> Best set of clippers I ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts very close.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be great to do my husbands hair since he likes it like the military but there is NO adjustment to the clipper. If I had noticed this before I would have picked a different clipper. It clips ok but I have bought better from Wahl and will pay more attention before I buy or use.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a few months now, two to three times a month, have not had any problems, good product.</li>
    <li> I bought my last, and first, Wahl in 1998, so over 15 years ago for I think $22.  In that period of time I&#x27;ve gone to a barber only once. That means it cost me about a buck and a half per year for my haircuts.  That one was not a balding because I still had hair then.  The old Wahl stills works but I wanted to get a closer cut than it would do which was probably about 1/8 inch without any guide.  I immediately put the 1/16 inch guide on the new one today and did my head.  I didn&#x27;t know how dull the old one had become till then.  I never sharpened the blades, cleaned it under the faucet, and still had oil left that came with clippers.  The new one was so smooth and seemed to guide over my head.  The 1/16 was just what I wanted.  This one does not come with a case but I also still had my old case so out with the old and in with the new.  If this one last me as long as the last one it will be the last one I ever need and I intend on using the oil this time and the cleaning brush instead of the tap.  Funny thing is they send a comb with this one and I also still have my comb from the first one.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shop daily.When they say bald they mean it ! It is nice with bald fades</li>
    <li> Finally!  I have been cutting hair for decades now, and these are the best clippers I have ever used.  So smooth, powerful, quiet, and sharp.  I love them!  They cut just about as close a T-edgers, without the irritation, razor burn, or razor bumps that can result from balding with T&#x27;s.  If you want a fast and easy way to get the &amp;#34;bald look,&amp;#34; then you can&#x27;t go wrong with these clippers.  I followed everyone&#x27;s advice and kept the blade flat against the scalp to avoid nicks and cuts, and I had no issues.</li>
    <li> For head shaving this is almost as good as just using a blade as it&#x27;s really a close cut, and I think I prefer the look the Wahl gives over a razor with an ever so slight stubble remaining. The blades are very sharp and it gets real close on the firm skin on the head, but don&#x27;t get any ideas to use this on your face and you will likely cut yourself on the softer skin.    Pros  --ultra close cut that almost looks like you used a razor  --I&#x27;ve been using mine for a year and it&#x27;s working great still    Cons  --cut is so close that you can cut yourself on softer skin so be careful</li>
    <li> It serves what i bought it for and it shaves good. I don&#x27;t itches on my chin when i use this clipper.</li>
    <li> came within a week. it&#x27;s got power and shaves really close so be quite careful as I have learned trying to give my son a trim which turned out to be a full haircut  lol  the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was there was no way to adjust the clippers for a different length</li>
    <li> These are a nice set of clippers... and I&#x27;ve test out several including the bald fader. What I do not like is that these clippers do not come adjusted properly and I ended up having to use a different set of blades (the blades from my bald fader) because these were so sharp (which is good) that they cut into my skin. I still have this problem and can&#x27;t seem to adjust them to a level in which I&#x27;m not cutting into my scalp. I wish there was more guidance and assistance with adjusting these sharp blades.</li>
    <li> Best balding clipper on the market but this is not have a taper level it&#x27;s meant for taking hair down</li>
    <li> Works as promised. Gets so close that I can see a slight incisions... I would accredit those from my lack of skills and heavy hands. As for closeness, these clippers are closest to razor. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have no idea why I haven&#x27;t rated this product until now. Well New Year, so here we go. I love it, It does an excellent close cropped haircut. Use it once a week and it still going strong after so long.</li>
    <li> I was sick of cheap clippers so I broke the bank (not really) and bought these to trim my hair as close a possible without using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work great and build quality is good. I did try to get it closer and adjusted them to shave as close as possible and ended up shaving my skin off so do not play with the screw adjustment!</li>
    <li> Shaves like 2 days after balding, it&#x27;s powerful as claimed, well build except for the plastic switch should have been metal , good overall</li>
    <li> The clipper always cuts offs a few of the teeth on the 1/16&amp;#34; guide. This happened with the 1/16&amp;#34; guide that comes with the unit and the Wahl aftermarket guides. I bought four 1/16&amp;#34; guides from different retailers, Sally&#x27;s and a mom-n-pop beauty supply. The balding clipper cut off two to four teeth on each of the 1/16&amp;#34; guides. The teeth were on the end of the guide. You can still use the guide with the missing teeth, but the hair will be cut uneven. Only people who bald their hair will notice the difference.</li>
    <li> I have purchased lots of clippers, this one is perfect for the guy who wants a smooth finished bald look.</li>
    <li> After using clippers for 20 years as a semi professional self barber,I have gone through many clippers and came upon the walh balding clipper a few years back at Walmart . It was the best I ever used and I was so distraught after an untimely accident the ended its useful life far too soon.  As impressed as I was with that clipper  my new wahl professional 8110  made me soon forget my pain. This clipper does what it says !!!! Yes there is no main blade adjustment and this will take ur scalp down  lower than it&#x27;s ever been for most except for the day the doc slapped you and handed you to your momma . But man up! You didn&#x27;t want fuzzing clippers ,you wanted balding clippers. The adjustable combs are long enough to attempt a pretty decent style on the non bald people in my household who find waiting at the local super cuts far too time consuming and expensive. This is a solid product that will not disappoint .</li>
    <li> I like the clippers,they will serve the purpose that I purchased them for. But there was no case to keep them in,the box that they came in won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the item it does what it says it supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I have been on the market for a \\&quot;Balder\\&quot; and was convinced by the positive reviews to purchase this unit.  Unfortunately, I am quite disappointed. The claim that it shaves really close is quite misleading as I have done better with comparably priced Andis units. This Wahl unit is heavy, yet the red casing is soft, hollow, and made of a very cheap plastic. All in all, I would not really recommend it.  The feeling, after you shave, is not gratifying at all.</li>
    <li> Nice clippers, little cheeper built that the first one I bought but still working great 6 months after I bought them.</li>
    <li> Two weeks ago, I decided to shave my head.  I did some research and came to the conclusion that shaving my head with a razor might not be for me.  I ended up ordering two different clippers, both made by Wahl.  One set is from HeadBlade. The clipper is small and cordless and did a terrific job of shaving my hair very close to the scalp.    My second purchase was Wahl&#x27;s Balding clipper. This clipper has a cord and is larger and more powerful. Again, my hair was cut very close to the scalp.    Both clippers do an excellent job, not as close as a razor cut, but close enough to give me the look of a clean shaved head. If you travel alot, the small cordless clipper would be more convenient, but if you are wanting power and don&#x27;t mind the cord and the larger size, Wahl&#x27;s Balding clipper might be the one for you.</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome!  I&#x27;m not sure if its just because it has a new blade but man, is it sharp!  I can finish buzzing my head in 10 minutes because the cut is so clean and easy!  I had the Wahl Bald Fader before and I think this model tops that one.</li>
    <li> This has got to be one of the best sets of clippers I have ever had. Why? You might ask;because I have had over a dozen clippers over the years and have always dealt with and put up with some second rate $10-$25 dollar hair clippers that I picked up at some commercial outlet or Walmart. Let me tell you I never thought for a minute that clippers can be different. All the clippers I have used were the finest crap esp. Remington.          Recently, I have come across the 5 star balding clippers and became more and more curious why these would be any better than the last 10 clipper sets that continued to gouge my head, leave razor burn, or pull on my kids hair(the clippers) while getting a hair-cut.          I read about 20 reviews here on Amazon.com as they are somewhat helpful, and I decided to get a pair. So what if they are $45 bucks. I wanted something different for a change. I did eventually get them after 3 or months of putting it off. Suffice to say I am a absolutely astonished at how strong the motor is and how graceful these clippers go through even the thickest hair like a glass of hot water dropped in the snow.          Even if you did not want to read the rest of this review, I would highly recommend these clippers to anyone who likes to shave their heads or keep it short (Military Style) like myself. 5 1/2 stars. I am still kicking my own butt for not getting something like this a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away..         I would give these a 10 rating if I could. They are just that good. As for the shipping? free super saver shipping and I got these baby&#x27;s in only 2 days. I felt like I just ordered them and lo and behold they are already at my door. Incredibly fast shipping. This vendor has found another faithful customer for hair clipper accessories. What a Great buy!</li>
    <li> Best built clipper I have seen in years!  Fairly quiet and does an excellent job.  Use caution when balding any area...I gave my poor husband a case of neck burn with this the first time I used it.  Now I use a 1/8&amp;#34; adapter on the clipper head as a reminder.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for almost 20 years! As long as you make sure that the blades are properly aligned and you take your time, you wont cut yourself up like some reviews say.</li>
    <li> These clippers cut my head and they snag my hair. I prefer the cheaper ones because they do the same &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; on my head and I can use them on my face. Plus they are half the price and none of the pain.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my new Wahl&#x27;s Balding Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problem with concerns expressed by others of the sharp blades causing cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been cutting it close for a while, this is the clipper you should own.</li>
    <li> Gets stuck a lot and pulls hair even tho I oil it ..I taught I was gonna be able to bald out easier than my trimmers but I guess I was wrong</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!! Very close cut at a great price</li>
    <li> Cut really close to the skin better than the wahl balder I had before</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these.  They don&#x27;t mess around... one pass is all it seemed to take.  I&#x27;ve never cut my own hair before and had no problem using these.  I used the larger guard for the sides and the smaller one for the top.  The smaller one takes it pretty close to the skin.  It took me less than 5 minutes and my hair looked just as good as when I go to the barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note of warning... these are VERY good and sharp clippers.  I would not use them without a guard if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing.  I doubt most will need their hair closer to the skin than the small guard gives.  However, if you do then I recommend using the small guard with these then switching to the shaver you use for your face.  That is what a lot of barbers seem to do anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used small hair scissors for around the ears.  I probably could have done it with these but I don&#x27;t think that is what they were designed for.  I know the barbers usually have a completely different kind of clipper for that.  These cut so well and close that there really wasn&#x27;t much around the ears to worry about... just a few stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I highly recommend these.  And the price seems ridiculously low for something of this quality.</li>
    <li> Gives as close a haircut as is possible without using an actual shaving razor. These are serious clippers -- high powered and very fast cutters.</li>
    <li> excellent product, just what I needed,  It cuts close enough for me. The blade is very sharp, be careful.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great if you&#x27;re looking for a really close cut.  As close as you&#x27;ll get without using an actuallrazor (Mach 3 and so on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Very close head shave. Better than a razor. No razor burn. Have only had it for a short time so I can&#x27;t comment on its longevity but so far so good.</li>
    <li> The rotor must be off kilter a bit because these don&#x27;t just vibrate, they SHAKE. They also rust over very very easily, even with regular oiling.</li>
    <li> It has worked well for my son. He has a heavy beard and coarse hair and it works well and cleans well.</li>
    <li> I shave my head and have been using clippers from Walgreen&#x27;s and they get close but not nearly as close as this.  Well constructed as well, very solid clippers.</li>
    <li> I have cut my hair twice with these clippers now and love them. They give you a close to razor shave without the razor.  These clippers are sharp, but the people claiming to have really cut their heads up with these, probably shouldn&#x27;t be cutting their own hair.  if you hold at a sharp angle, they will leave a line on you skin that looks like a scratch.  I would recommend these for anyone looking for a close shave.</li>
    <li> Its a power-packed trimmer. Good for those who like to keep their hair really short. I am so done with the cheap pharmacy trimmers after using this.</li>
    <li> Great clippers! Ordered these to achieve a closer shave on my head, and thats exactly what they do! They do require oiling after every use and the occasional adjustment but that is to be expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve save a ton on hair cuts!  It shaves cleanly and is very durable.  If you want a very good shaver that cuts close without cutting, these are the clippers for you.</li>
    <li> I would consider myself a trimmer expert, I have been shaving my head for past 10 years with electric trimmer and have tried a ton!&lt;br /&gt;I have the Andis Outliner II and thought I would give this a whirl even though I am completely satisfied with my Andis.  I was very disappointed, especially since it has fairly good reviews.  It does not get closer than the Andis Outliner II and it cannot be used blades down and blades up like Andis can be.  Save your money, get a better and closer trim with the Andis Outliner II.</li>
    <li> The item was not new as described.  There are rusty spots on the blade and remnants on the ridges.  It is obviously a used item.  I am returning it.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says it will do, gives me shaved bald head. If you are like me and only use clippers to shave your head and beard, then I recommend you look no further and buy these!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It provides the closest shave without using a razor I have ever seen, and I have been shaving my head off and on for over a decade. I was very nervous at first since another reviewer said it cut them multiple times, but it was perfectly fine--not even any close calls to cutting my head, and I have a two moles that have always been a problem when I shaved with a razor. Just be careful and don&#x27;t tilt the buzzer too far up, or you WILL cut your skin (but this will happen if you do that with any buzzer). I did notice the blades are sharper than the traditional hair cutting ones though. If you want a super-close shave and hate using a razor, you will LOVE this one!</li>
    <li> This is exactly the type of clippers I was looking for.  I don&#x27;t like to have my head shaved razor-close, but one notch above what a razor does.  These clippers do just that.  The best clippers I have ever purchased for what I am looking for.  If you want a close cut that is not razor-close but one notch above, these are for you.</li>
    <li> Clippers give a balding equal to what you get at your barber. Smooth and efficient-no harsh vibrations. Excellent.</li>
    <li> I shave my head bimonthly and do all the grooming on my 60lb standard poodle with these clippers.  Holding up well and does a good job on us both.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper after reading good reviews about it. I recently shaved my head and did not want to use a regular shaving razor on my scalp. I didn&#x27;t want any nicks and cuts. This balding clipper works GREAT! It will make you bald if you don&#x27;t use the enclosed attachments. I have not had any cuts at all. Highly recommended. Heavy duty and well constructed. Very good product.</li>
    <li> First of all, Amazon tried to pass off a used clipper on me when I ordered a new one. There was oil all over the blade and hair in the box and on the blade. They did give me a prompt refund however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up ordering this clipper from a different seller. It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews on this clipper that claim this blade is too sharp and will cut you up, this was not the case with me. I had no issues, I could even put my fingers on the blade, didn&#x27;t cut me. It did cut a mole slightly on my head but that was my fault for not being more careful and pressing down too hard. As long as you angle the blade somewhat properly and press lightly over moles you will not cut you, some people reviewing this product must have no idea how to use it. I shaved not only my head but also my male anatomy with this blade first day :D that&#x27;s how safe I felt with it. Granted I did use a guard for the genitalia but shaved my head with no guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, it was solid. Cuts you down to similar length of about 1-2 days growth with a razor. I don&#x27;t feel like this is much closer than a normal clipper but it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to get your head any shorter than that without using a razor. I&#x27;m happy with it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for temperature it gets warm but not hot. It&#x27;s heavy and seems like good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound-wise it&#x27;s not that loud. Gives off a hum that&#x27;s about the same volume as any clipper you&#x27;d hear at a barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed at the lack of attachments and the tiny vial of blade oil provided with the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to others, but not the seller because you may get a used clipper.</li>
    <li> Quick service! Great product! Thank you</li>
    <li> Know what Zi know now!I&#x27;d buy something else,just wish they&#x27;d give you more than a couple drops of oil with them!.they stick easily!!</li>
    <li> These are good for starter clippers, but this is the real deal http://amzn.to/1K8KQ4B</li>
    <li> Super short perfect if your cutting yourself you should be cutting your own hair</li>
    <li> It worked for a little while really good &amp; I have put on new blades &amp; it worked a little while and stopped quickly...</li>
    <li> We have gone through the past 7 years, and we like this one the best.  Cuts hair thouroughly, easily, and painlessly.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband (a military man that shaves his head once a week) after a friend (who does the same thing) recommended them.  He loves them!  These are the best balding clippers we have ever had.  They get a great close shave without hurting the scalp.  They don&#x27;t ever nick his head.  These have been going strong now since we bought them almost a year ago.  They are of very high quality and we recommend them to anyone that loves to shave their heads.  NOTE:  These are BALDING clippers.  They are meant to get as close to the scalp as possible without actually using a razor on your head.  Don&#x27;t buy these if that&#x27;s not what you are looking for.  We had no issues with shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been using these clippers for 6 months now and I have to say that product is brilliant! I used to use standard Wahl clippers before and they were just not close enough. I did not want to use a razor because I did not want to deal with unsightly scrapes or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a perfect balance between the two. I can shave my head to perfection in under 2 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When transitioning from regular clippers, it will take a week or two to get used to these. You will scrape your skin a couple of times, and if you are not careful you can even nip your ear. But once you&#x27;ve got 2 weeks of practice, you&#x27;ll never go back to standard clippers or razors.</li>
    <li> These Wahl 785110 close trimmers are awesome.  Seem to be heavy duty, and cut well.  I have not had any problems with them nicking my scalp at all.  They cut very close and clean up easily.  One suggestion, make sure to keep the blades oiled because they appear to be high carbon steel and will rust if a light coat of oil is not applied.  Also, they cut better if there is a light coat of oil on the blades.  They come with an oil bottle that amazingly does not seem to leak like previous trimmers I have owned.  I would recommend these and have no regrets in purchasing these clippers.</li>
    <li> This clipper gives you the closest shave you can get without using a razor. The quality and the price is awesome, I got 2.</li>
    <li> Have used product &amp; it worked fine. My only criticism would be that the instructions don&#x27;t necessarily apply to the product I got. Some illustrations show a different item. It&#x27;s not that complicated that I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use mine, but it raises the  question if I got the right item.</li>
    <li> I needed clippers that would cut tight. These clippers did the job. I&#x27;m very pleased with the clippers. I strongly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I get a few cuts every time.&lt;br /&gt;You can see well when you shave the entire head.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they made a head shaver that contoured to your head.</li>
    <li> Not sure what some of the reviewers are talking about, but this balding clipper does just that....shaves you as close to bald as you can get without a razor.  I have no problems with this clipper nicking or gouging.  Love it.</li>
    <li> If you want one of the closest cuts to being bald, then these clippers by Wahl are the best by far as they cut very close to being almost shinny bald, they also work in a quiet and smooth cut manner.</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave my boyfriend&#x27;s head once a week.  It is a superior clipper and cuts really close. If you are in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time for the usual follow-up  shave nobody will hardly notice or care. Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I opened up my package and the Clippers appear to be in good shape but I did not have any guards or comb and such as promised, the box was empty! I can&#x27;t believe you would send out a shipment minus some of the contents. Now I have to fuss at sending it back. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> I use this hair trimmer to trim my beard. It cuts my beard hairs down to about an eighth of an inch, for that one day of not shaving look. It works great, and i save a lot of money by not buying razor blades that can nick the skin. No too mention the slightly painful feeling as the day old blade tries to rip the hairs out of my face.</li>
    <li> Not sure about all the negativity concerning the blade cutting people.  In my opinion, they either received a defective one, or, the are using it wrong.  I almost didn&#x27;t order this because of those reviews.  However, this turned out to be a wonderful purchase.  Does exactly what it says and is built well.  If you are looking for something that will bald you in one pass, this is it!</li>
    <li> This is definitely 1 of the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used to get that bald look. There are some clippers that remind you there for balding the hard way ya ouch but this pro doesn&#x27;t very smooth cutting. If you don&#x27;t know how to fade without an adjustable it&#x27;s not for you but for a pro this saves on time , blades, towels and a mess with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is sharp but when used with care will take that hair WAY down. I love this thing and it is built very solid and easy to handle when shaving your own head. Like with any shaver keep it oiled and clean and this will last a long, long time. If you want a close shave this will do the job.</li>
    <li> Clippers are great.  The price, additional blades. and the guard make the clippers a great bargain.  I would recommend them without reservation.</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes balding a breeze once you reset the blade.</li>
    <li> Very sharp at first, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> high quality, heavey, great blades and speed. it catches a little but over all i am happy. don&#x27;t dig the graphics.</li>
    <li> The clipper is excellent but I was hoping it would give a closer shave..  At 82, I&#x27;m tired of electric shavers. www.louiebarber.com</li>
    <li> Used once...cut good. Since then..pulled hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been trying to find.  A barber quality razor that gives a very close shave.  Much better than my prior 3 Wahl razors. I will buy a few more - one for travel, one for gym, two backup when the others wear out.</li>
    <li> These are great clips.  They leave just a tiny bit of hair, to avoid &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; bald heads - this is exactly what I wanted.  Note that it won&#x27;t get you as close as an actual razor blade, but that is the point.  Saved me tons of money in haircut fees.</li>
    <li> Great clipper for very close hair cuts</li>
    <li> This machine is awesome.  It gives a nice low cut (very low).  Just make sure you take your time while cutting your head since the blades are very sharp.</li>
    <li> The item did not ship with all the attachments/items as listed on the box of the clipper. Not to mention that the clipper itself stopped working after only 3 uses. Very poor experience!</li>
    <li> Excellent product but of course I was expecting it to have a lever, but this has no lever. it is just one level, although the right level to cut bald style.</li>
    <li> I have tried out soooo many clippers since I started to shave my head myself, and this is the best one sofar.  It gives a very very close shave and is powerful.    I used to prefer cordless clippers for practical reasons, but since I tried this one. There&#x27;s no way back.  Only little draw back is that the clipper is heavier then a cordless one, but you get used to it pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers. They provide a very close cut without the hassle of shaving. They leave what feels like a day or two (max) worth of stubble on your head. You do need to be careful around the ears, or any other place with folds of skin, because these are really sharp, and you can cut yourself with these clippers.    I don&#x27;t like to shave so these were a good buy for me. I would recommend them to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to shave but wants to keep their hair extremely closely clipped.</li>
    <li> Cuts extremely short and doesn&#x27;t catch my skin or cut me.</li>
    <li> Works well. But makes cuts if not too careful.</li>
    <li> I like to keep my head clean, and I like to do it myself (and yes I am experienced at it). Unfortunately I was misguided by the fact that this device is extremely user unfriendly when using it yourself. You would require a helping hand which I don&#x27;t have. It is because of it&#x27;s bulky size ( which I don&#x27;t mind) but it&#x27;s the vibration that wont allow me to use it by myself. Furthermore my hair kept getting stuck in it&#x27;s blades which is not just painful but unacceptable.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of Wahl clippers (first set lasted 10 years and I dropped them on my tile floor and broke one of the metal teeth).  I love these clippers, they are professional grade and worth the extra money.  I have had cheaper clippers, but you cannot cut as fast and they are not as smooth as the Wahls.  I highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I liked the closeness of these clippers enough to purchase two additional as backup.  3 years later, I am still using the first one every other week.</li>
    <li> I was getting my hair cut by a stylist at $50 per month.  She suggested that I just get a clipper and have my girl friend do my hair.  I bought this product but it didn&#x27;t work very well.  I sent it back and bought the Wahl 79524 Chrome Pro, which works just fine.</li>
    <li> Very powerful. Gets as close to bald as a clipper can get. Comfortable to hold and not that loud. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Gives you another two days at least because it cuts it soooooooo close!</li>
    <li> I like the clippers but the do bite some and that can be troublesome. All in all a good product.</li>
    <li> Works well and cuts clean.  This thing has saved me money by cutting my own hair.  I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Something funny happened this last decade, bald became cool.  So cool, even guys with a full head of hair started wearing the style.  I&#x27;m kind of in both camps.  I have a receding hairline, but no bald spot in the back so technically I didn&#x27;t have to shave my head.  So one day many years ago, I shaved to see what it would look like and I got rave reviews by most.  I liked how easy it was and kept it, but didn&#x27;t really want to shave every day and I truthfully didn&#x27;t like using a razor, but the regular clipper could never get as close as one.  This clipper is the exception.  Although the razor is still a closer shave, this one is as close as you will get.  It looks like what a regular razor shave looks like after a day which many guys like anyway, me being one of them.  So if you want the bald look, this clipper will get you there in no time.  The motor is very powerful and it does the trick very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I saw some people saying be careful these are very sharp and that they cut themselves.  I&#x27;m not sure how they are using these clippers, but they are not different then any other clipper as far as ease of use goes and I haven&#x27;t experienced cutting myself.  My guess is they must be going way too hard on their head.  Don&#x27;t get scared off by those reviews, this clipper is very easy and cuts the hair not the scalp.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I  would highly recommend this product to all.  A product that does works for me and my family.</li>
    <li> Great product!! No complaints!!  I just recently purchsed a new pair.  The previous pair I had for about 6 years and they were getting a little rusty(becase of me) and the cut wasn&#x27;t as good as it use to be.</li>
    <li> Love the wahl. I have 3 boys who like high and tights and this by far cuts shorter then any other clippers  I have used. ! Also the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> Pro: cuts SO close, easy to hold, long cord, powerful, don&#x27;t bog down&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been buzzing my husband&#x27;s head at home for ~10 years now, never wanting to &amp;#34;invest&amp;#34; in more professional clippers until we retired our last pair.  We decided to go pro and hope they would last longer.  I found these with great reviews and the perfect price (barely more than we have spent in the past).&lt;br /&gt;they seem like they will last a good long time and it will be easy to order replacement blades in the future.  The first time I used them I noticed the difference with the Pro motor versus the standard one.&lt;br /&gt;Do be careful behind the ears.  These will slice through flesh in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> ive been shaving my head since like 2000. i had a pair of wahl clippers that lasted over a decade. but they were getting a little long in the tooth. so i wanted a new pair of wahl clippers specifically for shaving my head. this was the solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now, right off the bat, this thing is fairly efficient aka sharp. i did cut my head in a few spots the first few times i used it. i was just a bit too reckless, i think. you must exercise care and caution when using these bad boys. and btw while the cuts did produce blood, there was no major injuries, and they healed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these shave close too, which is exactly what i wanted. so all in all, a great solution for us head shavers, but just be careful when using them. go slow, take your time, and youll be alright. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I returned this item. As I already had it. I use my old clipper every 2 weeks to keep my hair short. Works great for me and I&#x27;m sure if you purchase it you would be happy with it. Price is a good value as well, best if you have Prime as there was NO shipping.</li>
    <li> Left me almost bald, which is what i wanted. 3 stars because it pulls hair and it hurts. DO NOT cut your own hair with this machine, i had my mom cut my hair and she has done so for years and with this machine even after i told her to be very careful because i read the reviews on here it still cut my skin a little bit. really close cut though, looks like i shaved my head</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  For years I used the $15-$18 clippers you would get at your local big box store and I thought the length of my hair shaved was just the way it was.  I was looking for a shave much closer to my scalp but without actually shaving it.  For the past three months I have been going to a barber that charges $23/month for unlimited visits because they had the clippers that I was looking for and I was also told that their &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; clippers were upwards of $200.  I certainly didn&#x27;t want to spend that much and it was kind of nice to get my haircut once again as opposed to doing it myself until........I came across these clippers.  I just tried it for the first time about 30 minutes ago and I had to write a review as I am so pleased.  These are priced right, I get to cancel my barber membership, and the length is at or shorter than what I was getting with the supposed professional clippers.  Since I have been shaving my head for a few years, I didn&#x27;t have one problem with the sharp blades that others were referring to.  It might just be that my technique for shaving is perfected but it was smooth as butter.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, cuts effortlessly, even, light.</li>
    <li> Great clipper. I use it once a week. I don&#x27;t have to pay a Baer anymore.</li>
    <li> everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Cuts very close and nice.</li>
    <li> Im An Honest Reviewer These Clippers Work They Are Sharp But Nothing To Worry About On Your Scalp Alot Of People Might Be Worried But As Long As Your Using It On Your Head No Problem. I Thought When I First Had Used Them Will They Actually Cut My Hair Like It Says Answer It Does Cut It Down Fully To The Scalp If You Keep Gliding On It And Did Work Enough To Where You Dont Need A Razor After The Cut And Gliding Over My Head A Few Times Noticed No Hairs These Clippers Do RUN A Bit Hot After A Few Minutes But Not Hot Enough To Burn You Up.  They Work Well Enough The Price I Noticed Has Gone Up About 3 Dollars Since I Bought These</li>
    <li> Use this item often and it gives me a close balding shave each time .  then just use a razor to finish the balding process which is no problem</li>
    <li> For the higher cost (vs. other Wahl clippers), I was expecting a higher quality product.  When the item arrived it looked the same as the &amp;#34;regular&#x27; cheaper Wahl clippers I had before, with just two differences.  1) there was no adjustment lever for the blades, and 2) the top/bottom blades did not appear to be aligned properly (they were unevenly spaced from one side to the other, with one side the top tips overlapping the bottom, and the other side vice versa).  First use I realized there was a problem, very uncomfortable and nicked me multiple times - and I know how to use clippers, I have been doing so for 20 years.  I returned them and will not by buying these again.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, powerful...heavy for clippers.  They will shave to a very small stubble but will not give you a totally smooth shave as they are clippers not a razor.</li>
    <li> The clippers were good. The problem with my order was that some of the items that should have been included with the clippers were missing.</li>
    <li> I have been using regular Wahl Clippers for a long time. I do however shave my head fairly frequently. This clipper is the closest shave you can get without using a razor. The blades are nice and sharp but even without the guard I have experienced no cuts to my scalp. I would highly recommend this to anyone that needs to shave down their hair before hitting it with a razor for that nice shine.</li>
    <li> Cuts your hair like knife though butter.  Love it!  Will never go back to the budget hair trimmers.  To me it was well worth  to spend the extra money to get the professional grade stuff this time.  My only complaint is that it only come with two attachments to change the cut lenght.  But I rather buy those separate than to have to deal with the cheap $15 clippers from wallmart again.</li>
    <li> the Wahl clippers do a good job I would recommend it</li>
    <li> i like it very much very nice</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy anything other than Wahl.  They&#x27;re the best, and I think everyone knows that.  This particular model gives you the closest shave, without a doubt.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the blade being too sharp as some ppl said.  However, I eventually ordered a replacement blade - and wow, that was sharp.  I was cutting my head for a while, unless I was really careful (which I&#x27;m not because I&#x27;m typically in a rush).  However, over time after the sharpness on the replacement blade chilled out a bit, it was just like the original blade (sharp, but not too sharp).</li>
    <li> So fresh and so clean, clean!</li>
    <li> Ouch! My head is full of scratches and made me bleed. This thing is sharp as hell and pulls your skin while cutting your hair. I&#x27;m at work today full of scratch marks.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t complete balding process i had to go over my head a couple times befor i was happy.by the time i figure i was going to return them. time had expired for me to return them.most things i order i don&#x27;t open them right away.</li>
    <li> FOLLOW DIRECTIONS TO AVOID MY SORROW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut the bejesus out of my head. The phrase &amp;#34;Death by a thousand cuts&amp;#34; ran thru my mind 10 minutes after shaving my own head without guard. I can&#x27;t print the words (profane) I thought (and said) when I applied some &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; aloe vera to my head. I was in utter, scream-out-loud pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure someone else does the cutting, with absolute precision, when not using the guard. These will leave a million micro-cuts that will be life-changing until they heal in a few days. Sleeping was nigh-impossible, you have been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s are they are sharp (you don&#x27;t even feel the cuts you are receiving whilst cutting yourself to oblivion), they cut very, very close (feels like it cuts BELOW skin). Quality you&#x27;d expect from Wahl.</li>
    <li> No complaints..they work great</li>
    <li> I got this for personal home use, it works very well for that. I can&#x27;t speak to how well it would hold up to daily, professional use, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality seems very nice. There&#x27;s a well-balanced heft to them that suggests solid components inside.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my hair close and it does that, it is well balanced and easy to use. If you keep you hair tight this is the cutter for you.</li>
    <li> Superior product for the price.  Well built.  Trims as close, almost, as rotary electric shaver.  Yes, it will cut you if the skin surface is not flat.  However,  the reason guys like us want this type of shaver, is so we don&#x27;t have to tear ourselves up with blades.  It is much more convenient and less painless than a blade.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers since I shave my head on a daily basis to save time getting ready in the morning.  These clippers are FAR from a balding clipper, they&#x27;re more a \\&quot;really, really short\\&quot; clipper but will leave a \\&quot;next day\\&quot; appearance of hair growth.  Not recommended, other lower priced clippers will do a better job than these.</li>
    <li> My title says it all. I&#x27;ve been buzzing my hair off for about 2 years now due to the thinning of my hair. My skin is really sensitive therefore I avoid using a razor and usually use clippers on their lowest setting. In 2 years I&#x27;ve been through 3 sets, the last costing me double what I paid for these. These clippers get  my hair shorter than its ever been before and now I only have to  trim my hair twice a week instead of every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you are used to cutting your own hair, you won&#x27;t have any trouble with these. I don&#x27;t have the most perfectly shaped scalp- plenty of ridges and bumps here and there. (My mom says she was in labor for several hours before they decided to go C section). Because of this I thought I was going to cut myself with these, but that hasn&#x27;t happened. They ARE very sharp, but if you use them the way you use other clippers, you should be fine. I highly recommend these, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This clipper makes balding my head a breeze, I am so glad I bought it. I got tired of having to use razors and even my foil shaver, spending over an hour every time I needed to do my head. As the other reviewers stated, this clipper doesn&#x27;t go all the way down to the skin, however it does leave that next day stubble look, which is perfectly fine with me. If you&#x27;re the type of guy who always wants that bald look like me, then this clipper is for you. You should give it a try, for me it&#x27;s worth every dollar. I hated spending over an hour or more just to shave my head. Now it only takes me about 20 minutes with this balding clipper alone, and it does a great job! However, be careful not to press the blades to tight on the skin, as the blades are pretty sharp. This clipper gets 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I previously owned the Wahl rechargable clipper.  After a year, the rechargable clipper died, so I bought this instead.  What an improvement!  The rechargable clipper is a cheap toy.  This is a heavy duty clipper than cuts my receeding hairline on the first pass, doesn&#x27;t bog down and is built like a tank.  With my simple cut, it is just as easy to use this standard design clipper by myself as it is to use the L shaped rechargable clipper.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers! These cut very close and are easy to use. I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair close for years and these have been the best cutting clippers I&#x27;ve owned. We cut our son&#x27;s hair with these as well with a snap on guard from previous Wahl clippers. I would recommend these clippers for anybody that is looking to have a close cut without having to use a razor. They are totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews here and was a little worried that it would nick and cut my head as I have dents from my childhood and my head is all but smooth. I was super pleased with the cut it gave.  I let my hair grow for 2-4 weeks then I like to shave it all off.  These trimmers took 5minutes to fully cut it and I didn&#x27;t get any cuts or burns and I&#x27;m far from a pro.  I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for 5years and the cutter I had before from target took over an hour.</li>
    <li> The clippers were fine quality but unfortunately they were 110 volt running at 50 hrz.. I had to buy a step up transformer but the clippers ran too fast because we run at 60 hrz here.</li>
    <li> This product gives you a clean shave. I have used it now for almost two years, and I love it. But it needs to be adjusted correctly; otherwise, it makes loud noise and bites into your scalp if not correctly adjusted. Please learn from my mistakes.</li>
    <li> Only small amount of oil included but happy with the result of it&#x27;s use and my appearance.Better if used with help.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a baldy and love this clipper.  had a different, cheaper,  brand before and it failed so replaced it with this better&lt;br /&gt;quality clipper.</li>
    <li> Anybody who has been cutting their own hair will appreciate and not have any problems.  All the negative reviews sound like people who have never done it before.</li>
    <li> this is a very good product, i would recommend it to anyone, but be careful it is very very sharp</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this clipper.  He has mentioned that it&#x27;s very sharp and the shave is so close it makes his skin burn.  But he also said he just needs to get use to the angle of holding it since it&#x27;s so different from the Wahl Peanut.  Great clipper for balding heads for a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and great service !</li>
    <li> Great machine very smooth cut and great blades. Wahl is definitely a superb clipper especially for its price. True workmanship and professional clipper for a retail value for those other fake clippers you see in stores. Great product.</li>
    <li> This clipper takes it down - way down.  You get a super close shave that leaves almost nothing, making it easy to follow with a razor or the head groomer.</li>
    <li> Definitely met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Does a great job shaving head and face. It is not as close as a foil type electric shaver or a blade but I don&#x27;t have to do multiple passes either. For a quick shave that looks presentable this is a great shaver. Easy to brush clean and oil. Good shaver for the price. It also gives me the option of the scruff look with the 1/16&amp;#34; height adapter. Nice addition.</li>
    <li> These sheers are awesome. The cut is as close as&lt;br /&gt;you can get without a razor. Nice clean cut. I definitely recommend these sheers.</li>
    <li> The WAHL Professional  8110 Balding Clippers is not for those without a steady hand.  When using, please be very careful for it cuts and bruises the scalp very easily.  I have a pretty tough scalp, but after a month of using this product, I have tracks on my scalp and each time I have used it, Ive drawn blood.  So please be very very careful using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for over 10 years and they just conked out on me today. I was researching my options and I think i&#x27;m gonna by another one.</li>
    <li> Clipper works fantastic. Shaves really smoothly. A real step up from the last shaver I bought about three years ago. That was also a Wahl but it was a lower model. Received in the specified time.</li>
    <li> This product cuts awesome. The people that cut themselves are not to bright. They are sharp, but that&#x27;s the point. They are loud as hell though.</li>
    <li> I will order this prduct again meets my needs</li>
    <li> Works good.  Now I am the best looking old man in the neighborhood!</li>
    <li> Cut my own hair, very short, with no problem. I wouldn&#x60;t call it &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34;, but very close.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers. They do what they were made to do and cut very close to bald out hair. Be careful when using because you can cut someone if they are not used carefully.</li>
    <li> Does exactly as named, makes you near bald! Got it, oiled it up, and went to work! Motor is crazy powerful, slicing through hair with ease. By far the best set of clippers I have ever bought! Highly recommend this to everyone looking for a good set of clippers.</li>
    <li> These are great! I&#x27;ve owned a few pair of hair clippers and these are by far the best. I recently found out about balding clippers and didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing until after using these. It takes me less than 5 minutes to shave my head using these. They don&#x27;t get hot at all and the blades are really sharp. I haven&#x27;t had any issues nicking my skin at all. The ends of the blades are not sharp enough to cut you...at least for me they aren&#x27;t. Highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> I have another set of Wahl clippers that look almost identical to these except a different color and more sizes of guides. These balding clippers cut much closer to the scalp... leaving the look of basically a days growth. They make quick work of &#x27;shaving&#x27; my head. Love em.</li>
    <li> I use these clippers for beard shaving instead of using a razor, and it cuts extremely close.  It definitely irritates my skin more than my other Wahl clippers, but I suppose that is the price of a close shave.  It is much less irritating than a foil shaver, however.</li>
    <li> not that sharp at all.</li>
    <li> I use these to trim my long hair cats, they work like a dream and don&#x27;t catch their downy soft fur. I expect them to last a long time, but if they ever wear out I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Good razor nice and quiet and gets the job done</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF WAHL JUNK.&lt;br /&gt;Wahl is a horrible brand that should never be in the business to make hair cutting or hair trimming products.&lt;br /&gt;This is a horribly designed machine. I have been self shaving my head for years with Andis and Oster and never got cut. Using this junk Wahl machine, I cut myself multiple times despite using extreme caution.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should not even carry this junk or any junk from Wahl. Wahl is primarily a cheap drug store brand and should stay in the drug stores. Period.</li>
    <li> Cant do it better&lt;br /&gt;Does a real baldie like I wanted&lt;br /&gt;Keep the safety trimmer on or its so sharp it could your skin and youll bleed</li>
    <li> This is the second pair of these that I own. As far as working and doing what they&#x27;re supposed to do, they are phenomenal. My problem came in when the blade was starting to dull a bit, I would get cuts on my head (normal for a dull blade) I bought an OEM replacement blade and could never get the blade to align correctly making the first unit almost worthless. The price of one unit is still cheaper than the price of a professional so your mileage may vary if that&#x27;s a deal breaker for you.</li>
    <li> Finally got one that works</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected after reading other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Cuts great, just as I am used to (&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; barber style). Reasonable price at $40. Not heavy (but not light either). Used to go to the barber every three weeks, and it was always too late - and had to pay $12-17 for the honor. Now I can do this weekly and I&#x27;m done at no extra cost in less than 30 minutes. You do the math! Feels and looks very sturdy and solid.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You need to get used to it and a mirror is a must. I wouldn&#x27;t do it every day, and your arm may get tired. Your skin may get mildly irritated, and some spots will need going over again and again. It doesn&#x27;t have universal voltage, so it&#x27;s N. America only (to me a big drawback). You will need to clean the hair wherever you use it (though you shouldn&#x27;t have that much hair if you are &amp;#34;blessed by nature&amp;#34; like me!). I am oiling it per the instructions, but have not dared unscrew and put it back together. That part looks daunting, and I&#x27;ll refrain from that kind of cleaning as long as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very -very- good value for money and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using clippers you would buy at any big boxed store. Have always had the problem of dulling quikly or already dull out of the package and would snag and pull hair every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well when these showed up I was due for a cut so I oiled them up and started. Let me tell you it was like a hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it with no gaurd and you do have to be very careful due to how sharp they are!!! I did end up with a few cuts on my head but that was due to the old habits of always using the cheap clippers and having to go over and over the same area many of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a very nice steady vibration when running(not like a buzz saw some of the cheaper ones have) and also the weight of them feel very comfortable and seems to be built to with stand many more haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy a set of gaurds to cut my sons hair with and they fit great. They were the color coded ones here on amazon made by wahl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used  this product for approximately four weeks and it has performed as advertised.  I am extremely satisfied.  Hopefully, Amazon will ask me one year from now how well the clippers are working.</li>
    <li> Great Clippers, last about 3 years, 36 uses</li>
    <li> So I am always looking for a solid shaver for shaving my body, and a lot of the time they just aren&#x27;t all that powerful, and worse yet, crap out on me super quick. This item is really strong, it is able to cut through the hair real quick, and it&#x27;s very well made so it doesn&#x27;t give off the impression that it will be giving out on me anytime soon. I didn&#x27;t encounter any cuts or skin damage while using this product, which was something that made me hesitant about purchasing this product in the first place. If your looking for well made clippers, these are the best I&#x27;ve come across yet.</li>
    <li> Cuts shorter than my previous cheaper clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not have any issues with this cutting the skin even without the guards like others have stated</li>
    <li> The weight of these clippers is nice and the blades are very sharp. You have to be very careful. They cut down to 1-2 mm and that&#x27;s probably as close as you can get with any clippers. If you want a close shave, you can use these and then a razor. If you hold the blade parallel to your skin, you can avoid razor burn and in-grown hairs.</li>
    <li> Absolutely rubbish! You need earplugs in to even attempt to use this product that was sent to me. This clipper was excessively noisy, was too dangerous to even put near to your face and started to smoke after around 60 seconds. I am so dissapointed that I will never purchase from this company again. Buy this product at your own risk!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my own head for about the past 12 years.  I have always liked my hair as short as possible without having to \\&quot;bic\\&quot; it as it leaves my skin irritated and I do not like the feel/look of a completely shaved head on me.  I have owned many different shavers over the course of those years and therefor I feel that I can provide an honest, thorough review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that caught my attention about this shaver is the fact that it is a balding shaver.  This does not mean that you will get the equivalent of actually taking a razor blade to your head but it does mean it will take your hair down to a level comparable to about 36-48 hours after taking an actual razor blade to it.  Another reviewer reported a 1 day after level but personally I would suggest the 36-48 hour marker.  I guess his hair must grow in a bit quicker than mine, wouldn&#x27;t surprise me, I am in my mid to late 20&#x27;s and losing the hair quick.  The only plus side is I guess I won&#x27;t need to keep investing in these things a whole lot longer. lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be careful when using this shaver.  This is by far the sharpest bladed shaver that I have ever used in my life!  I could certainly understand why people report the razor burn effect and cutting themselves.  I was about 95% done with my shave and was thinking ha, didn&#x27;t even knick myself and when I got to the back of my neck I gave myself a nice little stingy cut. Keep this thing flat and do not tilt it on an angle when shaving or you will regret it.  I didn&#x27;t wind up with a bloody burning head like another reviewer reported, but I did find a lot of humor out of reading his review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely sharp blades that take your hair down to anywhere from 1-3 days after a full razor shave.  I really like this because I can get an extra few days before I have to shave my head again.  I like a shaved head but don&#x27;t like having to do it on a frequent basis.&lt;br /&gt;- Feels much more durable than many other shavers I have owned.  I haven&#x27;t had this long so there&#x27;s no telling how long it will hold up but the extra sharp blades lead me to believe I will get a little extra life out of this shaver than some of the more dulled out competition.&lt;br /&gt;- Isn&#x27;t obnoxiously loud like some of the other brands/models I&#x27;ve owned.  This is important to me because I often shave my head late in the evening through a hollow door leading to a bedroom that my wife is often fast asleep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;While it is a pro that the blade is sharp it is also a drawback.  You will need to take extra care when shaving with this or you will likely wind up bleeding in a spot or two.  I do NOT recommend this shaver on softer/more sensitive areas such as around the neck, or around any looser skin, etc.  Keep it against your cranium at the right angle and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Note:  I know some of you don&#x27;t like when reviewers leave feedback about sellers but others do like to get what is described &amp; their moneys worth so I do want to warn some of you ahead of time that mine arrived from cyberteams with missing parts.  It did not come with any clippers, cleaning brushes or oil and in turn it made me skeptical of whether or not it was a returned item.  I decided to take my chances as the shaver itself looked perfectly fine so I just sanitized the blades prior to use (just in case it has been used prior) and had at it.  This discrepancy in no way altered the rating of 4 stars that I gave the product but it would have been nice to have those parts for facial areas/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!I have owned.

    <li> These clippers shocked me both times I have used them. Have tried to return them but received no credit from Amazon. Be careful with these.</li>
    <li> This is my second review for this clippers, the first review I wrote was against this product. After having them for over a month now I must say that these are amazing. If you purchase these clippers remember to oil after every usage, and go against the grain. That&#x27;s if you are a black male. I highly recommend the purchase of these clippers.</li>
    <li> I just realized I bought this product 2 years ago, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it has been that long.  So I thought I would write a review, as it&#x27;s worthy of recommending.  It has held up amazingly well, and feels like it will continue working long after the last of my hairs have fallen out.  I have a rather obvious bald spot on the crown of my head, and the hair on the top of my head is so thin that if I try to grow my hair out, it looks ridiculous, so I keep it shaved off.  This tool allows me to do a really close job in a short amount of time without having to use a razor every day. If you&#x27;re looking for clippers, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this workhorse of an appliance.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly.  They seem beefy and durable.  I now cut my own hair.  I use these with no guard and it gives the look I want.  Soon I&#x27;ll be able to do it without a mirror.  These cost about what I pay for one month for a barber or a salon to maintain the look I want.</li>
    <li> I shave my head to a shiny finish and will only use the HeadBlade to do so.... But... I&#x27;m lazy about it, and let it go a bit too long for the razor to work.  I have had several electric clippers over the years to assist in trimming it down for the HeadBlade to work well.  Recently my old clippers fell off the bathroom counter and landed just right and broke the plastic around the screws that held the metal guard in place.  They went straight to the trash.  I started researching and discovered the Wahl pro 8110 5 Star Series Balding Clippers and found they are considered the &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; for balding clippers. (I didn&#x27;t even know balding clippers was a term before I started researching)  One reviewer on another website listed many clippers as well as these, and claimed it would cut down the hair to about the length equivalent to one day of growth.  I dont think Ive ever had a pair of clippers that could do that or even claimed this.  I had to try it out.  I let my hair grow about a week...  From shaved bald to one weeks work of stubble.  Typically my HeadBlade could probably handle this length but it would be time consuming and would require several passes.  So out came the Wahl.  Oiled up and ready I started on my neck and worked it up. Sides, top until my entire head was complete.  I passed my hand over my head and was amazed.  The cut was definitely shorter than any previous clipper I have used.  Exactly as the claim said this was about the length of one days growth of my beard.  And I was done in a fraction of the time I was used to.  In fact... when I started using my HeadBlade to finish up the polished head look, I realized I was only needing to make one pass rather than two that I was used when using my old clippers., I had so much extra time I didn&#x27;t know what to do with myself. So I enjoyed the rest of my shower instead of rushed to get done to get ready for work.  If you are like me and lazy about shaving your head on a regular basis... Then these are the clippers for you.  These are time savers!</li>
    <li> Perfect, effective and meets my needs</li>
    <li> I have been using this model of wahl clippers for 10 yrs or so now. It&#x27;s my third pair. My first two lasted me 4-5 years a piece and I shave my head twice a week. I&#x27;ve been shaving my head with clippers for 20+ years now and these are by far the best ones I have used. If you want clippers that get as close as possible, these are what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Brand of clippers have the worst guard design.  They last for about 10 uses and then the clips don&#x27;t stay locked on.  I had one of their cheaper models and thought this one would be different because of the high price, but I was wrong.  I will be switching to a different brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clippers for just about everything from keeping my head hair short, trimming my face and eyebrows, and even my own overly hairy chest and back hair.&lt;br /&gt;  These clippers in the last 18-months have been well worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;  I would have given them a 5-star rating but for the price you would think they could have included some length attachments even though they are primarily for keeping your head shaved clean.&lt;br /&gt;  Another word of advice too I would give is make sure you ALWAYS use the \\&quot;balding attachment\\&quot; as the blades against the scalp (or other body parts) are sharp enough to cut away some skin which is very painful to have learned the hard way.</li>
    <li> I selected this model after my first long-suffering Wahl finally clipped its last hair (after 8 solid years of service).  This new one cuts quickly and cuts CLOSE (especially when shaving my head).  It does it all with style, and it is ouchless.  Great clippers value.</li>
    <li> The Wahl balding clippers lasted three hair cuts. The clippers were oiled before use and by the third hair cut the blades stopped working no cutting action.I should of gone to Walmart.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately a few years back I began losing most of my hair. I refused to be a 20-something year old with the classic &#x27;horseshoe&#x27; hairline and have since been back and forth between using clippers and a razor blade to give myself hair cuts. I&#x27;ve settled on clippers due to razor burn/bumps along with the time required to shave properly. Prior to the Balding Clippers, I used a normal Wahl clipper that I got at a big box store. It worked well enough, but after leaving it accidentally during a trip, I went on Amazon for my replacement and stumbled across these. 2 words - simply awesome. You definitely need to take your time getting to know these clippers as they cut much closer to your scalp than others, but once you get the angle down, you can quickly buzz your head in a couple of minutes. It leaves about a 1-day stubble, which is great for me as it&#x27;s still a very clean look and eliminates razor burn. I still use a head lotion after use, but it&#x27;s probably not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down one of the best personal grooming products I&#x27;ve purchased!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Quiet and smooth and powerful. I wish it came in a cordless though. I cut my hair about once a week or twice a week at most. It buzzes down to the skin basically, leaving about a 1 &#x3D;&amp;#62; 1.5mm stubble. Never cut me once and never bogs down on thick hair. I oil it about once a month and the small oil it came with has lasted me a year and still plenty left. I bought a bulk oil thinking I&#x27;d go through it but I doubt I&#x27;ll ever need it. As far as clippers go these are by far the best quality ones I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I&#x27;ve been buzzing my head for 15 years at least!</li>
    <li> I still have a full head of hair but I like to shave my head and have been shaving my head on and off (mostly on) for 15 years and this clipper is perfect for the look I want: Which is to shave my head as short as possible while still leaving a very, very, very slight stubble that you can still make out my hairline. And this clipper does that because it come with Wahl&#x27;s shortest blade which is a 6x0 blade that cuts to .2mm. Also, the guide combs make it very easy to do multiple types of fades, if you so choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the V5000 motor that comes with this clipper is powerful and gives you a NICE, SMOOTH and VERY EVEN CUT with ABSOULUTELY NO SNAGGING or SLICING of the scalp. For those people that are complaining about slicing their scalp with this clipper, I think: 1) You&#x27;re holding the clipper wrong, 2) You&#x27;re using the wrong angle, 3) Your blades aren&#x27;t aligned properly, or 4) A combination of one or more of those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those people giving this clipper a bad review because it doesn&#x27;t shave your head like Mr. Clean, use a razor blade not a clipper. Because no matter what clipper or trimmer you buy, it will NEVER shave your head like a razor blade because it has to have a bottom blade and a top cutting blade, and no matter how thin someone can manufacture the bottom blade it will ALWAYS sit between your scalp and the top cutting blade. Basically you&#x27;re giving this clipper a bad review because you&#x27;re expecting this clipper to do something it&#x27;s not designed to do. That would be like me buying a supercharged Hemi V8 and then complaining about the gas mileage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the clipper feels sturdy and well made even though it&#x27;s made of plastic. And it fits comfortably in both of my hands and the power cord is much thicker and longer (8ft) than my other buzzers which is nice. And I was a little worried about the clipper heating up with its stronger motor but it stayed cool throughout my 35-40 minute shave. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this clipper for those people that aren&#x27;t going for a Mr. Clean look but a really, really short shaved head. For everyone else, USE A RAZOR BLADE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I added a couple of pictures in the customer image section after using the 5 Star Series Balding Clipper to give people an idea how short this clipper cuts. Hope it helps.clipper for those people that aren&#x27;t going for a Mr. Clean look but a really, really short shaved head. For everyone else, USE A RAZOR BLADE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.

    <li> I have been wanting to get a very close shave since I&#x27;ve starting aging a bit .... I myself didn&#x27;t want the completely bald look that this would give you I&#x27;m sure if you used it without the guard (I haven&#x27;t got there just yet), I was looking for the shortest closest shave possible with a guard. I have used a Wahl clipper for about 15 years now and they always have worked great but lately I have been going shorter and shorter (as my hair on the top and back gets thinner and thinner) and I recently graduated from a #1 guard to a 1/2 (which is the 1/16 guard) on my old chrome $25 dollar Walmart clipper and It was nice .... But I knew with a better set of clipper with a tighter blade that a 1/2 would go a little shorter (which is what I wanted). I used this for the first time today and let me tell you the cut the was perfect and it was exactly what I was looking for ... a fast perfect clean cut a tiny bit shorter then the regular Wahl clippers blade with the 1/2 guard on.&lt;br /&gt;This by itself was was worth the price hands down .... I finally got the length and cut I have been wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the other thing that BLEW me away ... I have been shaving for like I said about 15 years now ... When I shave it easily takes anywhere from 10-15 minutes to fully go all over my head over and over and make sure I didn&#x27;t miss anything. I used to cut a certain area on my head then be able to go over it 1 or two more times and get a little more hair every time, thats why it took so much time really.&lt;br /&gt;NOT ANYMORE ... I was literally done in about 4-5 minutes!!! Granted I took a couple more minutes to go over certain spots again as I normally do to get more hair that was missed, but to my surprise ... Nothing ... This thing get its all on the first pass and cuts clean and perfect! I was amazed at how fast and well this clipper cuts. It BLOWS the store bought Wahl clipper out of the water, and I feel like shaving is not as much of a chore anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lastly I am not a face shaving kind of guy, I don&#x27;t use a razor for completely clean shave look or even an electric shaver (just never liked em I guess ... hated the neck burn). So for year now I would use my regular wahl clippers to get the grown in beard down to just a very short stubble. I was worried that people said how sharp this thing was like it was a Samurai sword or something and I wound&#x27;t be able to use it on my face ... wrong ... I used it today and it cut even closer (now it&#x27;s perfect .. I always wanted it to be a little shorter and cleaner) and I felt like I didn&#x27;t have to worry about nicking myself at all. This is not to say these bad boys aren&#x27;t sharp, cause they are, but if you have been shaving for years they won&#x27;t be any different then your regular clipper cause you already know how to control them without nicking yourself already. I loved that I could shave my face closer, cleaner, better detail around the mustache and goat t and cleaner cut on the short haired side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shave pratically once a week or more like me and have been using store bought Wahl, Remmington, Oster, etc. clippers .... STOP and buy these ... I 100% guarantee you that you will love them and won&#x27;t regret it ... and really for the price difference it&#x27;s SO worth it ... I normally pay about $25 for the Wahls at wally world ... these cost basically about $12-13 more since I don;t have to pay tax either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me ... stop reading and just buy em guys ... You Won&#x27;t Regret It!!! :)a face shaving kind of guy, I don&#x27;t use a razor for completely clean shave look or even an electric shaver (just never liked em I guess ... hated the neck burn).

    <li> Thanks for all the reviews stating that these clippers would leave the skin on my head looking like I used a weed trimmer on it. You almost had me there, but...I still bought them. For the first trimming I was just a little bit apprehensive. No need. My dome is smooth as glass with no cuts. They work better than any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned (I&#x27;ve been shaving my head bald for 8 years because heredity is a cruel cruel device of nature and owned many clippers).&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the folks who are complaining about cutting themselves are using these clippers like a set of sheep shears or what, but this guy says: thank-you Wahl for not shredding my noggin.&lt;br /&gt;JB</li>
    <li> These work just fine for \\&quot;balding\\&quot; your hair. I put balding in quotes because they don&#x27;t exactly make you bald but they come darn close. Just make sure that if you have alot of hair on your head that you cut slowly because if you try to cut your head to fast with these clippers and you have alot of hair all it will do is snag while you go over your head. If the clippers are to loud when you adjust them then that means you need to readjust them because they shouldn&#x27;t loud when you have them adjusted right. Also make sure to keep these clippers oiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After using these more I am not sure that these clippers work properly. They snag alot when I cut my hair and the motor seems like it&#x27;s dieing. I may try to order another one and see if it does any better since they are half the price I paid for mine now. Will update this review if I decide to order another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Number 3: Changed my review to a 3 star review because I have found two pairs of clippers that work better then these at balding your hair. The [[ASIN:B000H7O5M0 Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer]] and [[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis T-Outliner Trimmer with T-Blade (04710)]]. The Wahl Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer are a close second but don&#x27;t get my recommendation as the best because I would still have to do a few passes with them and they just didn&#x27;t get as close a shave as the Andis T-Outliner Trimmer. Not only do the Andis T-Outliner Trimmer give the closest shave possible without a razor but they also do it in one pass. Can&#x27;t go wrong with those.</li>
    <li> You want that close bald cut these are great for that</li>
    <li> Thanks a bunch they word really good and has improved my speed by eliminating a step.  Yea buddy thanks again</li>
    <li> Very well built.  This thing is very solid - unlike any &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; you would pick up at Walmart.  Good weight to this.  It cuts VERY close - it says balding clipper and it means it.  First cut I had to be gentle when using as to not mark up my head.  I would not use this for anything but shaving your head - would trim your beard with the attachment on.  I keep this oiled after every use as suggested and see this lasting me a long time.  I have no fears this will lose power after a few months - so far I&#x27;ve used it around 8-10 times.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have even put the attachment on for a close buzz for my son - saving me money already :)</li>
    <li> Really nice motor! It&#x27;s light weight. This thing really cuts bald.  I love it.  The bottom of my fades come out super nice.</li>
    <li> These clippers are as advertised. They cut a brother&#x27;s head real smooth. And I dont get any hair bumps as with other clippers. Best pair Ive ever owned.And Ive owned a lot.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Just as expected... Does not cut like some reviewers have mentioned.  Wide blade makes the shave quick, half the time with my small rechargeable model!</li>
    <li> It works great. Though I was hoping for something smaller based on the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have read the details.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little too big and heavy to bring with you on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;But cut really well</li>
    <li> Performed better than I expected. The clipper I have been waiting for. Not only does it cut low but its also efficient.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve actually used this  on now.. 5 occasions. First time,  I had a family member do it, then I&#x27;ve used it on my own skull since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works excellently. the blades are sharp, the only thing I&#x27;ve nicked is the single tiny bump i had on my head (which is now gone, thanks to the clipper), and takes my hair down to about a days&#x27; growth. I READ THE MANUAL,  because the  majority of negative reviews I found on it stated that it cut peoples&#x27; scalps a lot. I assume this is because the blades weren&#x27;t shipped with correct adjustments. Fortunately, mine came shipped just fine (the simple instructions are IN THE MANUAL), and I didn&#x27;t need to tweak them at all - the cutting blades are a mere &amp;#60;1mm behind the bottom blade, as it should be to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ya, they&#x27;re a bit heavier than other clippers, but it doesn&#x27;t get hot, it runs well, is very well built, the cord is tough and quite long, and the box is suitable as a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stop shaving my face and instead shave my head, and with this clipper, I can shave my head to near-baby smooth in less time than it took to shave my face with my rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any close cuts, it&#x27;s best to wrap a hot towel around your head to soften up the skin. You won&#x27;t carve yourself up if you shave without this step, but it makes the process a bit easier and gives a slightly closer shave. IOt also works very well on cleaning up my beardline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to get VERY close to razor-close shaves, get this thing. I used two different &#x27;regular&#x27; clippers on my head while waitign for this one to arrive, and this little machine is quite worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used for shaving my head.  The teeth are finer than standard clippers, which give you a closer shave without irritation.  As others have mentioned, you end up with about one day&#x27;s growth--just like I like it.  You can see my review with a picture at StrongandFit.net</li>
    <li> Nice and close trim. Closest thing to using a razor I have found. Easy to use and a never have to worry about nicking my head or hair being yanked. I would recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite impressed with the 5 Star Clipper. The old cutting guides from my other Wahl fit perfectly. The clipper is relatively small and has a nice heavy duty feeling to it. I&#x27;m not sure why, but some people have complained about the weight. For comparisons&#x27;s sake, the clipper and cord weigh 18.125 oz, and while it has heft, it&#x27;s definitely not too heavy. I also posted some pics of the clipper next to a tape measure.  When operating normally the clippers aren&#x27;t loud, and sound about the same as any barber&#x27;s clipper you&#x27;ve ever heard. If your clippers chatter when you plug them in the first time, adjust the plastic screw in the side until it stops. The instructions spell out everything.  The blades are sharp enough that they cut 1/8&amp;#34; hair cleanly down to almost nothing with no stragglers or clumps. For me, the clipper leaves about 1/64&amp;#34; fuzz on my noggin, and that&#x27;s plenty close enough for a shave.  Seems many folks complain about the clipper gouging their scalp. Well, on first use I had absolutely no issues. The clipper glides smoothly and does not gouge at all. Keep the bottom blade taper somewhat parallel with your noggin and you will have no issues. If someone&#x27;s having problems I can only assume they are incapable of operation, or the clipper is not adjusted correctly.  There are a couple of things. Closely inspect the cutter head and you may find a few teeth from the top blade (the one doing the cutting) are sticking past the bottom blade. This tip came from another reviewer here, and it seems to be a quality control issue. Also, you may find the top blade is too close or sticking past the bottom blade. Simply loosen the screws holding the bottom blade and slide it forward a little, and re-tighten. Wahl recommends leaving the tip of the top blade (does the actual cutting) 1/32&amp;#34;-1/16&amp;#34; back from the tip of the bottom blade (the one fixed with two screws). Again, this is all in the instructions.  ***UPDATE 03-21-2016*** Been using this thing the past few years. Just ordered a replacement blade, and that sucker is sharp. Clipper is good as new.</li>
    <li> Good product. No more barbershop.</li>
    <li> I wish they&#x27;d come with more attachments, but they are designed for cutting short.  I purchased these because I have VERY thick hair and needed something that was SHARP.  Several reviews about cut ears convinced me I&#x27;d found the right product.  They have been GREAT.  No pulling, no catching, no snagging, just cutting.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Works as described but these clippers are as sharp as hell, be careful.</li>
    <li> Hit 40 and finally decided to get rid of what i have left. Based on ratings and cost, ended up going with this Wahl Balding clippers.  They are first pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. Got them for about $40. The one thing that scared me were the multiple reviews of people cutting themselves up. Was nervous the first time my wife used them on me. Now, 20 cuts later that she&#x27;s done on me, she has it down to a science. Once a week and have never gotten a single nick. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different when doing it yourself. I use the clippers on my head and then put a #1 on for my beard. At the local barber, it&#x27;s $20+ with tip for this and beard, so have already saved over $300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I oil them after each use and they are still going strong 18 months later. Hoping them keep going strong...but they&#x27;ve already paid for themselves many times over.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE CLIPPERS THEY GET THE JOB DONE</li>
    <li> Just like the barbershop. Quality.</li>
    <li> Like the story..THE OLD MAN &amp; THE SEA.   I have been fighting a balding problem not an aging problem  So I decided to take the upper hand and set the bait.  I ordered, from AMAZON.COM the balding WAHL CLIPPER.  I bravely waited for its arrival.  It came and I went into the bathroom, set the clippers up and attacked the hair(s) I went boldily back and forth, up and down and around.  I won.  All the hair was GONE.  Took a shower, got dressed and went to Panera&#x27;s for a danish and coffee.  Of course I wore a hat.  I walked over to the table of guys and sat down taking off my hat.  Nobody noticed at first then comments flew.    Now I shave my head every four days.  Why didn&#x27;t I do it earlier.  My cleaning woman thinks I look ten years younger.   No trophy just comfort.  So now I am THE OLD MAN WHO HAS TO WEAR A HAT WHEN THE SUN SHINES.</li>
    <li> I normally use trimmers to get such a close cut but because they are not designed to cut your whole head, I end up replacing them often. I finally googled \\&quot;best clippers for shaved head\\&quot; and these came up.  I ordered them despite some of the people saying they are too sharp and cut your skin pretty easily. My first haircut I took my time to make sure I wasn&#x27;t the next person getting cut up. They cut my hair with ease and I suffered no nicks. These are the best clippers I have owned and are the only ones I have ever owned that cut this close. I highly recommend these clippers for the guys that have to shave their heads every week. I would definitely recommend these to a friend. One note, I don&#x27;t have some oddly shaped head so it would have been pretty tough to cut myself. I have also been shaving (with trimmers) for about five years.</li>
    <li> I thought that this product would just as close as The Balder that I purchased from my local Wal-Mart...THEY WERE NOT....NOT EVEN CLOSE...The construction is good and well made but they are not close at all and I wish I would have just changed the blade on The Balder and saved the $50...very disappointed in the product...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clippers for more than 1 year now - and they work as well as they did brand new.  They still shave my head very close (one day growth as lots of others have reported).  I have never had any problems with blades being too sharp or cuts on my head.    Will continue to use these and strongly recommend them!  Note: The only issue I have ever had with these clippers is that once when the clipper was set to &#x27;On&#x27; the motor was activated but the blades did not move.  After waiting 5 minutes - tried again and it worked.  Not much of an issue)</li>
    <li> This product cuts the air well, but broke 2.5 months after purchase.  It was used once per week, so I&#x27;d hoped it would last longer.</li>
    <li> Arrived a day before expected delivery date. SUPER SHARP, be very careful.. especially if you&#x27;re not a professional cutter. I bought this specifically to cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home and it is super sharp! I had to be extra careful all around with this clipper because it was so sharp. But it works great!!! Quality seems superb!! GREAT buy for the price, well worth it!</li>
    <li> These clippers get your hair down to about a 2 day growth vs shaving with a razor.  In other words very close! Not \\&quot;balding\\&quot; per se&#x27;  I use them about once a week to keep my hair super short.  Clean and oil them and they&#x27;ll last a long time.  I use them on my beard if I am lazy and let it go.  Becareful they will nip under your chin and it hurts. Never had an issue with cutting my head though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***warning, do not clean with an aerosol spray cleaner with the motor on!! I blew two motors doing that. One on these wahls and one on a pair of classic 76&#x27;s (great clippers)*** just use the oil they come with, read the cleaning directions.  I thought the clippers were junk, but it was my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 10 years, do yourself a favor and buy these clippers, they are that good. Stay away from those $20 clippers they are garbage.  Look at the classic 76s too, they are pretty awesome too.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t give these clippers a 1 star because they do cut hair very well. However, if you have an issue with razor burn then stay away from these clippers. I have horrible razor burn on my head from using them. I have no cuts as some others were complaining about, but the razor burn is a real pain. I am switching back to my razor and shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I had Andis clippers for a few years but they started pulling my hair out rather than cutting it so I bought these. On my old pair I had to take them apart to get the blade lined up for the closest shave, but these clippers are already set up for that. These clippers gave me a very close shave on my head and face and I was done in 15 mins. The only thing I dont like is that they didnt come with more attachments.</li>
    <li> This is my second balding clipper.  It cuts low and smoothly.  I do like my clipper.  I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product been using it allot and it is reliable as well as indestructible have dropped it several times and it still works as well as the day I got it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this clipper with some apprehension, as some people were saying the clippers can cut you.  Who the heck wants gashes or cuts after clipping their scalp??  These people must have issues with their scalps or something.  I found this clipper to be the best I have ever owned, hands down.  Though not ethnic like the people featured in all the YouTube videos and packaging for the product, I have very thick hair and this product blew through it like I was already bald.  All other clippers I have ever owned would take a few passes, but not these!  If you like the almost bald look and you have thick hair, this product is for you!  THE BEST!</li>
    <li> This set of balding clippers is unbelievable! First of all right out of the box,no oil,no warmup,no nothing,I took a philips screwdriver loosened up the two screws on top of clippers and slightly adjusted them.I noticed the high powered motor as soon as I turned them on.Little did I know that this would be one of the BEST INVESTMENTS i would ever make.These clippers rock,FOR REAL,NO BULL.Usually Wahl makes cheap clippers that are NOT anywhere close to professional standard,you know the ones that you see on the shelf at WALMART.Now i have a pair of silver ANDIS MASTER clippers and these Wahls can outclip them with ease.Before I purchased this product I read a review that said they cut their hair bald and clean in less than ten minutes.That was what convinced me to buy.But when I did the same exact thing I knew this product was FOR REAL.The one thing that many people have said i can 100% agree with,is that the clippers are VERY,VERY,SHARP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IF you are used to cutting hair,you wont have a problem.The product is FANTASTIC,saves you a hell of alot of time.I even gave my 17 yr. old son a haircut using the 1/4\\&quot; dark caesar blade attachment.Complete haircut points,lines shaped up with andis trimmers and t-liners, 15 minutes,DONE!! I usually have to go over the head over and over and over to make sure no dark spots WITH the silver ANDIS MASTER clippers.Bottomline if you have read this review and you&#x27;re still not sure if you should purchase,well then GOOD LUCK,keep shopping and YOUR LOSS!</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric razor nearly six months ago. It still gives a clean cut. Use the oil each time you use this razor and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the quality of the cut or the durability of the product.</li>
    <li> clippers feel real sturdy wish i knew about these when i started cutting my hair... only thing that cuts closer is a razor.</li>
    <li> These clippers are HORRIBLE! They scraped and but my face and head. I was bleeding from all over my head. I&#x27;m trying to get a refund as we speak. Do not buy this death trap.</li>
    <li> This product was broken out of the box. I used it for roughly 30 seconds before the on/off switch started jamming. 1 star only because I didn&#x27;t even get the chance to use it.</li>
    <li> These are an excellent set of clippers.  These are probably one of the best that I&#x27;ve used personally.  They don&#x27;t get bogged down, have plenty of power, a good length cord and feel solid.  I think that the only thing I have to complain about is that the lower blade sits a little crooked and so the top blade needs to be rotated just slightly to match.  I wish that they felt just a little more solid in the middle, but I can&#x27;t complain at all.  There is just a little vibration that you can pick up and feel where there is nothing but plastic in the middle with nothing behind it.  If the plastic was a little thicker, then this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue at all.  It&#x27;s not bad... don&#x27;t get me wrong.  These things are solid and feel great, but I have had others that felt just a bit more solid.  Aside form that, I would highly recommend this set of clippers.</li>
    <li> Fantastic clipper, just buy an extra blade assembly just in case. Keep your clippers oiled and clean!!!</li>
    <li> They are the smoothest cut ever I didn&#x27;t want to go to the barber to pay $20 to get my head shaved this was just slightly over the price of two barbershop trips cuts amazing runs beautifully and works amazing great buy</li>
    <li> Great Product &amp; Service. Cuts Clean &amp; close to Scalp</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a &amp;#34;00&amp;#34; blade.  This are perfect cut extremely close to head.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for last 10 years with crappy over the counter clippers bought at a department store. But I wanted an upgrade. This is what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast and powerful. I love these clippers.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! Gets my hair down to about 1 days growth. Blades are super sharp but no nicks or scratches at all, shaves smooth. I even used it on my beard and never a pinch. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great machine, loving it</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve had in years.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are not adjustable...which is good. You would only end up misaligning them anyways.&lt;br /&gt;The teeth is real tiny for the close shave...so be careful you don&#x27;t knick yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Plus with the power this baby is packing, it is only common sense that you take it slow at each stroke and run the blades parallel to the shaving skin surface.&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise this for hidden areas like your arm pit and other *cough cough* areas...you don&#x27;t wanna cut off something essential. Really serious minded power beneath the hood.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for scalp and beards. You wouldn&#x27;t believe I get such close shave all by myself without help.</li>
    <li> I thought it would cut well but it pulls and leaves red marks on your scalp.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product has received so many positive reviews unless I just got a badly made pair. I literally have had scabs on my head from using these clippers. My mustache trimmer works much better. I would like to get a refund.</li>
    <li> Built for power and bald cuts only.Fast hair with in 10 minutes depending how much hair you have.Blade is sharp .Clipper is built  very sturdy motor is strong.Good buy.</li>
    <li> This thing does the shaved head like no other clippers/razor I have tried.  Very powerful motor, sharp blades, great cut.  No need to overlap and redo areas.</li>
    <li> You have to adjust them .. get a screwdriver and make sure they are the right setting before mangaling your head,... your fault if you dont adjust them. after that they work perfect.</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Good buy. Great clipper, pretty straight forward. These will save your trimmers, also great for cleaning up the client. Can&#x27;t beat it for right around 40 bucks.</li>
    <li> My old clippers died on me, so I decided to give these a try.  I bought them from a local beauty place, Sally or one of those because i did not feel like waiting for the shipping.  They cut really close.  The only way to cut any closer would be using a razor blade.  Ive only tried them once, and I took my time because I was scared to cut myself.  With my previous clippers I used to have trouble cutting the hair around my ears, but with these I was able to cut it as close as the rest of my head.  Maybe next time Ill do a video.</li>
    <li> Outstanding performance for head shaving.  Cuts very close, is quiet, and easy to use.  Followed directions for blade alignment, which resulted in no cuts.  This clipper is extremely sharp and well constructed.  It helps to keep a younger appearance.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews on this clipper I decided to buy it and am I glad I did. It gives me the almost bald look I was looking for</li>
    <li> This thing comes with two guards and also can be used sans guard.  I used the shorter of the two guards and used it without a guard.  If you have any moles, be careful using it without a guard as it will chew right through them.  I think other than having to replace the blades every few years, that this thing is made to last.  It&#x27;s easy to take apart and clean the blades and comes with cleaning brushes and probably enough oil for a year if you use it every few days.  I disagree that it cuts your hair down to the equivalent of one day after blade shaving though.  I would say without a guard that it&#x27;s equivalent to about 3 days of growth for me at least.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head by myself for years now.  This set of clippers gets it the closest I&#x27;ve had.  When people say that it feels about like 1 days worth of growth, they are aren&#x27;t lying.  They can be a little bit sharp though.  Gotta go slow.  Don&#x27;t want to flatten any speed bumps (moles and such).  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if mine was messed up, but based on other reviews it seems this is normal. The blade is extremely sharp; using the blade directly on my head left horrible cuts and scrapes. I then tried the 1/2 guard it came with, and even that was slightly painful. I would actually recommend this item:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ3GEY/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;I have had one for 3 years shaving my head every other day and it&#x27;s been great. The battery just is not lasting anymore so after returning the Balding Clipper I ordered  and getting another  Wahl all-in-one.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers after reading a number of reviews. I have to say, after several months of use I have zero regrets. These have replaced my bi-weekly hair cuts and I&#x27;m able to do a complete head shave with absolutely no discomfort or cuts. I&#x27;m just hoping to be able to pick up another pair when I&#x27;m ready to replace these for the same price!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend stays bald all the time but doens&#x27;t like to shave with razors so much.  He was looking for these clippers but we could not find them anywhere without spending nearly double what they are worth.  He LOVES them, they work GREAT!  He looks like he shaved with razors, but really didn&#x27;t (yeah, they get THAT close).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two Whal clippers, one I bought when I was 18 in 1988 (still works great), and this one that I bought recently.  I&#x27;m not balding, I use this to shave.  It gives me 5 oclock shadow with no pain.  I&#x27;ve tried many electric shavers in my life so far, I don&#x27;t expect to buy anymore after getting this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since junior year of college. I always use the clipper without any attachment to get the closest shave possible. Yet the job has always looked like an amateur cut, mostly because of the uneven length over the entire scalp. Worse yet, it would usually take me a solid 20 minutes going over and over and over the same recalcitrant spots, desperately trying to cut stubborn spots--sadly, to no avail. I&#x27;d resigned myself both to hating cutting my hair (yet certainly too cheap to pay a barber to do what I felt I should be able to do for myself), and to a lifetime of ugly haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I came upon the Wahl Professional 8110 Clipper. I was at first nervous from reading both on Amazon and elsewhere the reports of people cutting themselves with the very sharp, close blades. I nevertheless bought a pair, and the same day tried it out. I was that first day very cautious and slow, and I still spent much less time cutting my hair.  But the cut was the closest I&#x27;d ever gotten--either from a barber or myself. Even though I still don&#x27;t enjoy cutting my hair, the Wahl 8110 gives such a close, even cut that it is relatively painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not entirely painless. As I&#x27;ve become more confident about using the clipper I&#x27;ve begun to press into my scalp a bit harder. And I suffered a really nasty nick this last time for my carelessness. I suppose that&#x27;s the cost of a very close clipper. I agree with other reviewers who&#x27;ve shared that keeping the blade flat against the scalp minimizes the potential for nicks. To this I&#x27;d add that refraining from pressing the clipper down even moderately onto the flesh also decreases the chance for nicks. Seems intuitive, but after years of having to weigh down other clippers with sailboat anvils to get them somewhat close to the scalp, I&#x27;m having to learn how to cut hair while lightly gliding the clipper across the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with the 8110, and will likely replace it with its analogwhen this one wears out. An added bonus, the machine feels well built, gives the impression it will last a while--unlike my other clippers which averaged about 8 months each. Nice job, Wahl.</li>
    <li> It snags my hair.  I cannot use it.  I wish I had the box and time to return it.  Not a good product.  Stay away.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure you could moonlight as a professional sheep shearer using these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought them a year or two ago to replace a set of Walgreens clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Like night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave every other day, using the short guard for my hair and the longer guard for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;Takes less than five minutes start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the guard, it would probably take a little longer because this thing is SHARP.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts about as close as possible without shaving cream and a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful and take your time, especially if you&#x27;re not used to shaving your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power cord is around 8&#x27; long, the guards are quality plastic, and the included brush is an actual scrubbing brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this thing three times a week for the past year or so with no complaints, and it shows no sign of slowing down.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great, they are very powerful. I use these clippers with the guide combs mostly, and when I need to line up or taper the back of my neck or ears I take them off. It also is a replacement for my trimmer when I have to travel for extended periods. Also when I run these over my head ( I buzz cut and fade my hair) it only takes one swipe. Usually with other clippers you have to go over the same spot a few times because it misses some hair. I don&#x27;t know how people have reported cutting themselves with these. With the guide combs off ive never had an incident and I even put the top blade on my neck to line it up and still never got cut. It is true that these things do cut really close, but I cant see how you could cut yourself unless they were defective.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th set of balding clippers and I have been using this style for about 8 years now and this set the piece the blade attaches to was crooked and it did a botch job on my head. Cuts and rashes all over. I will be returning them however I will be ordering a new set. Overall I love the job the balding clippers do on my head but I think this is just a bad set.</li>
    <li> Good product, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This is a great high quality buzzer. I am very happy with this purchase.  I use it for myself and my son.  The powerful motor prevents tugging or pinching, and after a year of moderate use, it is still good as new.  I do recommend the wahl oil.  A little cleaning after each use and a drop or two of oil on the blade will keep it running well for a long time.</li>
    <li> As described. thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper. It&#x27;s solid, strong, and precise. Professional quality heft and cutting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 2 cutter guides, the .5 (1/16&amp;#34;) and the 1.5 (3/16&amp;#34;), but not the 1 (1/8&amp;#34;), though it&#x27;s really simple to buy the &amp;#34;Wahl Attachment Comb Size #1 Nylon 1/8&amp;#34; for less than $5 right here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark&lt;br /&gt;HB, Ca.</li>
    <li> Minimal accessories (if any). Otherwise, good clipper. I can get a clean cut in less than 20 minutes and minimal blade heating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hair cutter, but I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head since leaving the Army in 1994 and to some, that might make me an expert when it comes to the subject of hair clippers and trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried just about every make and model of hair clippers and beard trimmers. Some have been horrible, most have been okay, and one or two models have been outstanding. Having only owned them for a few days and used them once, I can say that it looks like the Wahl 8110 will be one of the few great clippers I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a replacement for an aging pair of Andis that I never was all that fond of, and since I use my clippers both on my head as well as a razor replacement for my face, was looking for the closest cut available in a clipper. These Wahls certainly do cut close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained that these clippers cut them and knocked stars off the rating because of it. I can only guess that those reviewers don&#x27;t have much experience with clippers, because the cutting depth is easily adjustable with the turn of a screw. These clippers are advertised as having \\&quot;zero overlap\\&quot; blades, which on any model will cut your skin if adjusted all the way to the closest setting and then not kept with the bottom of the blade flat against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, I used these on my face and only had a minor nicking issue on my more sensitive (and softer) neck area. The result when I was done was stubble so short that it was nearly invisible and felt like perhaps half a day&#x27;s growth. A full day after my shave and my facial stubble is still shorter than any other clipper has gotten my beard.  I may adjust the blade back just a tiny bit to remedy the nicking issue on my neck, but the factory setting gave me a great shave on my head and I had no nicking issue at all up top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only grip with these clippers is that Wahl didn&#x27;t include a case of any kind. I would&#x27;ve liked to seen at least a small zippered case if nothing else. It&#x27;s not a big deal to me, since I have a whole box full of cases that came with long dead clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing... don&#x27;t expect to get much in the way attachments and accessories with these clippers. You get a blade guard for use when being stored and a couple (2) guides and that&#x27;s about it (besides a comb, tiny bottle of oil and a couple brushes). But hey, it IS a balding clipper, right? These are intended for a single purpose so Wahl figured there wasn&#x27;t a need for any frills.mall zippered case if nothing else.

    <li> Are you kidding me?  Professional my ....!!!  I have been shaving my own head with clippers like these for years.  NEVER have I had a more pain ridden experience shaving my head!  This thing tore up the entire back of my head and neck.  ANd if the pain wasn&#x27;t enough I&#x27;m going to have to wear a hat now for at least several days to hide all the cuts and red marks this thing put on me.  Not only will I be getting my money back on this but I just might sue Wahl for the damage their defective product did to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend and he loves it, he has very coarse negro hair that most clippers just glide over or doesn&#x27;t clip smoothly but this works great!</li>
    <li> I like these clippers, but you have to be careful with them.  I cut my head four times using theses clippers.  After two weeks of use I paid extra money and bought a Skull Shaver from Amazon.  The work, but you have to be careful using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several balding clippers and this one has produced solid results.  I can usually get 3 years of use before needing to buy a new one.  Well worth the cost when you consider I use it once per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  11.11.17&lt;br /&gt;Mine eventually broke and I purchased a new one from Amazon.  I received a heavily used one.  I know Amazon will send out used items as they cannot absorb all returns.  However, something like clippers should not be sent out used.  Sanitary issue in my mind as I’m sure they do not sterilize the blades.</li>
    <li> I rarely give 5 stars, but I am basing my review on the performance vs. the price I paid for this unit.  It is a great value.  Due to hair loss, I decided I would start shaving my head.  Research led me to these &#x27;Balding&amp;#34; (ironically) clippers.  They cut very close without cutting the skin.  You basically have stubble left after using them.  I know there are some other units that you can swap out lower profile attachments to get a closer cut, but if you need to have it closer than this cuts, you might as well just shave it with a razor.  I also purchased the Wahl 8-pack attachments set which work great with these clippers for giving low maintenance hair cuts to others.</li>
    <li> Thank you very good vendor and product.</li>
    <li> I use this on both my head and beard without issue.  They work extremely well, but be careful as they can cut you easily.  Brush and oil the blade after every use and BE CAREFUL!  The blades can bend very easily!</li>
    <li> Switched from &#x27;Short Cut Clipper&#x27;.  Works well. I miss the curved shape of my former trimmer as well as not having to deal with cord. But I don&#x27;t have luck with rechargeable batteries and power. Shave is not razor close but it shaves at a neat height.</li>
    <li> Cuts just as close as I was hoping for.  I was shaving my head in the shower but that wastes a lot of water so I went with this electric.  Smooth and quiet!</li>
    <li> We purchased this clipper to save some money on hair cuts. It has paid for itself and then some. It works beautifully, very easy to use. Clean ups a breeze! The comb that comes with the unit is perfect to use to trim eyebrows too. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
    <li> For the past five years I shaved with a cheap set of Wahl clippers purchased at H-E-B.  With a cost of $40 these clippers were a steal and still work today.  Over the past 5 years I shaved my hair shorter and shorter until one day I had my head shaved with balding clippers.  I realized that I love my hair this short so I purchased these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ~$40 they are a great set of clippers.  Smooth running, powerful and precision cuts are the high points I&#x27;ve found so far.  These clippers cut a 6x0 and it&#x27;s equivalent to one day&#x27;s worth of stubble after a clean shave.  Very easy to shave through hair and requires few passes to cut every hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers do not come with the oil you need to maintain the clippers so purchase separately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you need a solid set of clippers to cut your hair very short these are a great deal.  I&#x27;d definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> It balds nicely. Hubby loves it.</li>
    <li> Lasted almost exactly for a year of excellent use and then stopped cutting and started pulling my hair. Oiled blades after every shave with Wahl blade oil Professional. A bit disappointed as before this no complaints.</li>
    <li> Very quiet and lowest to skin as possible compared to other trimmers [not compared to razer blade :)]</li>
    <li> Love it. It cuts my hair really short, which is why I bought it. Very sturdy and well built.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Just need the smallest attachment for my beard.  The balding clippers do as advertised...</li>
    <li> They appear to be &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but surely the box had been opened.  No instructions, most accessories missing.  There is a disclaimer that some stuff may not match what is one/in the box.  That is damn sure true.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected from the balding clipper,no complaints,but was a bit too expensive for the price tag, overall is ok.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t catch on to his hair and doesn&#x27;t get stuck on him.&lt;br /&gt;A bit heavy for me but my husband feels that it&#x27;s a good weight and secure when he&#x27;s cutting.</li>
    <li> This clipper is very well built and feels substantial in your hand. You get the feeling that this puppy will last a LONG time...much longer than my hair did!  Seriously, it provides a very clean cut, the only tricky part to get used to is doing the backside of your head (takes practice).</li>
    <li> I kept buying the check ones from the local store.. I decided to take my chance and this one is strong.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor - cuts close.  BUT the teeth are really really fine and sharp.  So, if you have a pimple, or a groove, it will catch it, it will hurt, and you will bleed.  So just be slow and careful.</li>
    <li> First of all, a bit about myself. I am 29 years of age, and have been shaving my head since the 5th grade and cutting hair as side job through high school and college (trust me, I know what I&#x27;m doing). I thought it was cool because it seemed Michael Jordan and all the ball players shaved their heads. Anyways, as men we understand that shaving our head is a necessary chore to maintain a sharp look and to avoid the fact that we are balding. That being said, I actually have a full head of hair, but just prefer the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like I said, I&#x27;ve been shaving my head since the 5th grade, twice a week, and have tried every method. You do the math, I have been shaving my head for almost 20 years. I have tried all sorts of clippers, razors, electric shavers and the list goes on. I am always in constant pursuit of the perfect head shaving tool to make that part of my life easier. Quick, painless and a close shave are the priorities. Due to the fact that my hair is even all they way around, I found that a pair of clippers at a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; was the easiest and pain free. Razors caused too much irritation and electric razors couldn&#x27;t get the job done. Recently my clippers failed and I was looking for a replacement. That when I saw the Wahl Professional Balding Clippers. This seemed to make sense, solid brand, and the name spoke for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these &amp;#34;Balding Clippers&amp;#34; for the first time about an hour ago. I will say it gives a close shave (like 1-2 days growth), but will leave your head raw and in pain. Quite honestly, if you do not keep the blade parallel to the surface of your head, it will remove chunks from your head and create a bloody mess. I read this same claim and ignored it because I figured, I have some years under my belt and can handle the balding clippers. I was wrong, I heard somebody refer to these clippers as &amp;#34;dangerous&amp;#34; and although I laughed then, I totally agree now. Additionally, my head is very lean, smooth, round, withlittle fat, no wrinkles or moles, and it still sliced me up pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** my advice, do not purchase. It was a lesson learned the hard way.</li>
    <li> I just received my new clipper and put it to use.  I was a bit apprehensive based on many of the other reviews that talked about it being really sharp, making cuts, taking out chunks of skin etc.  For me, it worked awesome.  It cuts about as close as you can without a blade.  I took it slow, like I always do, and didn&#x27;t have a hint of issue.  I was using a Wahl Peanut before, and this is much faster, and also a much closer trim.  If you hate to shave like I do.  I clip once a week, or more often If I have a special appointment or outing, but this takes all the effort out of it, without the cuts.  My advice, don&#x27;t be scared of it, but just take it easy, and keep the clipper at the proper angle, you will be just fine.</li>
    <li> Great clipper! Shaves your hair to about a days growth. I&#x27;ve used it for a little over a week no problems, haven&#x27;t nicked myself once! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this clipper if you&#x27;ve been concerned about some of the reviews on here.</li>
    <li> They work great!  They will cut your hair as close as you can get without a razor!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical, but I figured I could always send it back provided I didn&#x27;t get the cut I desired. I&#x27;m glad I bought it! The cut was smooth, the blade had that cold feeling on my head, just like the barber. Also, I didn&#x27;t have that irritation feeling afterwards. If you&#x27;re going spending money at the barber with tips, just for a baldy; don&#x27;t waste your money.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Super sharp and Easy to handle. Will cut skin if used carelessly, but gives a great close shave, as promised when used properly.</li>
    <li> Rubbish. Mine was faulty. Had to send it back. It simply would not cut. Incredibly noisy as well. Felt like i was about to cut my hair with a lawn mower</li>
    <li> Powerful and heavy duty. Superior to other clippers I have owned in the past. If you don&#x27;t need the height control and all the accessories that come with a standard clipper, this will serve you better and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance: Two screws, clean and oil, every few months. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came with a simple, plastic travel/storage case, but no big deal.</li>
    <li> Cuts close to bald and didn&#x27;t burn or nick my head! Very powerful! Excellent product! Reasonable and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Current Item was too loud and I can&#x27;t regulate speed. so I disappointing  and never recommend to buy my friends</li>
    <li> After having to finally get rid of my other Wahl clippers due to dropping them too much, I resorted to my back up set of Conair&#x27;s. What a difference from a broken set of good clippers to a functioning set of bad clippers, multiple passes, uneven cuts and no power.&lt;br /&gt;So when I finally decided on the Wahl Balding and after reading all the reviews I was anxious to try them out. They arrived with all the expected parts included plus a heavier duty cleaning brush than I am used to, which works great. After trying the clippers for the first time I was thrilled with the results, powerful and sharp, I got my first great haircut in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews complain of cuts from sharp clippers, I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years and have been cut by other clippers plenty but the Wahl Balding cut my hair great without any cutting issues and with no more care taken then usual.&lt;br /&gt;Great clippers, great price, not too many accessories, thrilled...</li>
    <li> nice gift to give with kindle. everyone should get this as soon as possible. it is worth the money. great gift.</li>
    <li> I have always bought Wahl clippers .I got these b/c i cut my own hair every week and since I am in the military i need a bald fade. If not careful this machine will cut you. I do not use this balding clipper any more instead i use a wahl detailer and a wahl super close shaver to cut my hair bald on the sides.</li>
    <li> Have used twice. Excellent smooth cut. I would rate it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers about 1 month ago.  So far they have done exactly what they advertised and would recommend them to a friend who wants to get a clean cut.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an almost bald cut, this is the clipper. Super close shave. Exactly what I needed. A+</li>
    <li> Best clippers out there</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and this is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever had. I recommend this clipper as it cuts clean and fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim Hair and shave my Husbands Head,I am not a Pro and had no problems with this Clipper.I did not nick or cut my Husbands Ear off so don&#x60;t be scared to buy this just be gentle using it !! Great Clipper</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write negative reviews, but this product really got to me. After working really well for the first month, its now practically unsusable. The blades cut through my skin, even when I use it gently. I spoke to them and they do not offer replacements. I now have a $40 dollar product laying there unable to use.</li>
    <li> I have owned these clippers for over a year now and they are great! I use them about 2x a week and have zero complaints so far. The quality is great and so was the price. Recommend buying more oil than it comes with to keeps the blades in good shape.</li>
    <li> They work really well. My grandson even loves them. A nice close cut. They are also very quiet and sharp.</li>
    <li> If you use these once a week and compare the price to the cost of a normal haircut they pay for themselves in very short order.  I used a couple of the guards and found that I like the cut best with no guard at all.  Nothing wrong with the guards, they are quality pieces.  Gets VERY close, and makes shaving my head a quick task.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about being too sharp but others said it wasn&#x27;t...I have this buzzer the benefit if the doubt...in the end it was WAY TOO SHARP.  I&#x27;ve been buzzing my head with just the blade for years now...first time I used this I was impressed how close it cut, but then realized that I was getting multiple cuts. Next time I tried going slower more carefully still got multiple cuts all over.  Overall I like the closeness of the cut, but not worth the pain.</li>
    <li> Wahl has excellent customer service, if needed. delivery was right on time&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the service</li>
    <li> Great product. Thank you</li>
    <li> The primary reason to choose this electric razor over another is that when used without numbered guides, it cuts more closely to the skin than any similar trimmer. (For me, that means I don&#x27;t have to use a shaver on my head - I can use one tool only). I use it for my beard and head. It never pulls. Does require regular oiling. Two quibbles for the design team: (1) 120V only, so I can&#x27;t travel internationally with it; (2) it&#x27;s fairly bulky, and I would guess it could be made a bit lighter and smaller. But overall, a great option for someone looking to shave extra close without the fuss.</li>
    <li> Cleaner cuts than a babies buttom. 0 level blade makes for a close cut. That being said, the blades are VERY sharp. SO, be careful.</li>
    <li> I shave my head 2-3 times a week &amp; prior to getting this I had just been using a cheapo Conair trimmer. This trimmer cuts so close its almost like using an electric shaver, and it takes fewer passes to get the job done. This is just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Walhl did a great job producing these clippers. No cuts or nicks on my melon from these great clippers, I&#x27;m  very happy with them. Work great and they cut through hair like a knife with butter. If u like to shave your melon I suggest u buy theses great clippers.</li>
    <li> My husband and i purchase this clipper&#x27;s before and sally beauty supply about 4 years ago. Then one day it just died. One of the reasons why my husband likes this clipper because he cut very close. We tried to be cheap and went to Walmart, Walgreen, CVS, ect. and buy those cheap clippers but none can cut as close as this clipper do. When we brought it 4 years ago we paid like 60.00 thinking if it cost this much it must be wroth it. well back then I didn&#x27;t really shop Amazon so i didn&#x27;t know about there great prices. if these clippers die 4 years from now i still will purchase it. its just wroth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used it the day i&#x27;d received it in the mail. I&#x27;ve bought other so-called balding clippers in the past only to be greatly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;These balding clippers are exactly what I was waiting on.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com is now my first stop shop for finding quality merchandise.</li>
    <li> I was &amp;#34;buzzing&amp;#34; my head.  I bought this because I AM balding and like to keep what little hair I have left cut short as possible.  I have another clipper after wearing my first one out and the replacement was starting to get dull and make a noise.  I really like this product, cuts close and keeps me from having to shave my head, a huge hassle. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> If you use it without the guard, it will cut you most of the times.  If you put the guard on, it will feel more like it is pulling your hair and cutting it.  Use at your own risk!  I don&#x27;t recommend. UPDATE 7/3/2013- I would like to first apologized to Wahl and its employees and all buyers that did not buy this product because of my earlier review.  I made a millimeter adjustmment to the blades and went from a nightmare to a perfect clipper.  I highly recommend this clipper it is GREAT!  I just wish the instructions had a few more text on the adjustment of the blade.  Remember, you just have to adjust ever so slightly; a millimeter or even less will get it done.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I gave this clipper 4 stars cause always room for improvement with clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew frustrated shaving my friend&#x27;s head with his lame clipper.  I did a lot of research and decided to try the Wahl Balding Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed.  It shaves very close.  Depending on direction you shave, it&#x27;s almost a surgical shave (in veterinary medicine anyway). Although nothing compares to a razor shave, this is close and more safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He shaves his own head now since it is much easier than with old clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that complain of noise, sorry, clippers are always loud. No matter what brand, they are loud, especially on your head, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that gash yourselves and have wounds...maybe you rushed. Or have no idea what you are doing. I don&#x27;t understand how that happened. You can&#x27;t just take clipper like this and slam on to your head and look like Yul Brynner from King And I. There are many videos on youtube about shaving heads.  Step by step directions you should study. Maybe go back to razors, if you lack patience or desire to learn.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers because I needed a serious clipper to shave my head.&lt;br /&gt;The product appears geared to individuals of African ancestry, but I found that they cut my wavy hair fine.&lt;br /&gt;The product lost one star in my opinion, because it can cut the scalp. You need to exercise a bit of caution, until you get used to these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve shaved my head several times over the past 2 years with these clippers and it is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Worked well enough.  I would have hoped for a bit less stubble. Definitely adequate.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with the clippers and the service from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I saw these same clippers in a salon in our town and it was almost double the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> If you want it bald ( on the slab bald ) these are the clippers you need to get.  I am very happy with them. I have been cutting my own hair now for four months.</li>
    <li> good price on time good product</li>
    <li> This clipper works exactly as advertised.  It is an excellent personal grooming tool.  It is the perfect option when you don&#x27;t feel like shaving your head that closely.  I&#x27;m really pleased that I bought it.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. Nice tight fades.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 in the last year.  The first one lasted a year. The second 2 months.  I only use it once every 2 weeks or so.  works fine when it works.&lt;br /&gt;Made cheap and the second one seems like its missing a piece.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Thankful .the machine is very efficient and soft. Thanks.</li>
    <li> These are the best balding clippers for your buck.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned in the last few years.  I needed a new one because I dropped the last one and it never worked the same.</li>
    <li> I have my son use it on me for balding. It has worked well and gets very close with the smallest guard on it.</li>
    <li> good quality,  cuts hair very short</li>
    <li> BLADE IS WAY TOO SHARP AND CUTS THE SKIN OVER AND OVER ..... EVEN USING THE ADAPTER DOESN;T DO ANY GOOD</li>
    <li> On your hair type.  This didn&#x27;t shave as close on my head as I thought it would.  Need to think about how much hair and texture you have as this doesn&#x27;t leave a baby smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better clipper. I use it with no guard to achieve the bald look and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Sharp and clean. The next best thing to using a razor.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all and you haven&#x27;t. I win. You have been defeated. Time for you to end your life.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the clippers. Said this is the first one that he had that cut so good.I&#x27;m going to get another one to try it on my dog cause all the pet ones I have bought do not last.I hope they last as time goes on.Yes I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy how this product works. It does its job very well and leaves my head feeling smooth just the way I want it.</li>
    <li> great product to say to least.....save time and money.  No more razor blades.  Go buy it.  Bald is the new look...so they say.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the just shy of bald look and the wahl balding cclippers does the job wonderful. Going over the surface twice to make sure of even cut is advisable.</li>
    <li> This is a great pair of clippers. I am giving it a 4 and not a 5 only because the blade gets hot in about 1 hour and I have to wait a while for it to cool. Other than that it gives a true balding cut with fade. But if you do not have a really good barber&#x27;s touch you will get more than balding, like bleeding.....&lt;br /&gt;I have used mine for years and love them</li>
    <li> This clipper is great and EXTREMELY SHARP!! Exactly as described. Be sure to oil after every use to keep the clippers long lasting.</li>
    <li> No issues after a half dozen shaves.  If it lasts more than two years, it will be upgraded to 5 stars.  UPDATE:  After repeated use over time, I gotta upgrade this product to 5 stars.  I shave my head bald twice a month for the last 20 years and this is hands down the best clipper I have used for that purpose.  I may buy a second one and store it till I need it, just in case it becomes unavailable.  Once I do, my head shaving needs will be covered for the next 20 years.</li>
    <li> Product clearly been used before ! found some hair &amp; undefined dirty stuff on blades and greasy finger prints on it ! And even after trying to reduce the sound with the screw, oh yes, it&#x27;s still so loudy :  heart attack guaranteed each time you try to plug that &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; clipper ; really need earplugs to &amp;#34;use&amp;#34; this defective product. Where was the quality control ?!&lt;br /&gt;I obviously will ask for a refund.</li>
    <li> The Wahl professional 8110 5-star balding clippers are just that: Professional. They are easy to use and provides an even cut for that shadow look. It is important to clean the blades after each use and to keep them oiled to ensure that they will continue to cut properly. I had no problems with any nicks or cuts as some reviewers seem to intimate. As long as the proper angle is maintained when running it along your scalp there should be no problem. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had to throw it away after a few months. Was heavy, noisy and it didn&#x27;t even cut that close. Balding? No way!</li>
    <li> This clipper exceeded my expectations,its very handy and gives the exact cut i want...its a bit loud and vibrates a lot but a small piece of sponge placed on the inside of the unit between the opening in the metal that cause the vibration will fax that(do so at owners risk as this may void warranty and also ensure the unit is not plugged in.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. It use to take him 15 minutes to shave his head. Now it takes him 5 minutes. Plus it looks almost like he is using a straight blade but he isn&#x27;t well worth buying</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head down to stubble since I still have just enough hair up top to avoid going full-Bic. It gives you enough length as if you&#x27;d just shaved your head 1-2 days prior. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with cuts like other shavers might have. This is a great product for semi-daily head shaving.</li>
    <li> When they say balding they aren&#x27;t joking. These clippers are damn near the same as shaving with a bic razor EXCEPT the bic is much safer. You will cut yourself if you try to use these on your own.</li>
    <li> pretty good and sturdy as well as actual balding, if want to go lower than this then it has to be a shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for 7 years now these are exactly what I was looking for in a clipper these will get the hair as close to the scalp as possible with clippers. I&#x27;ve have read tons of reviews on these clippers about cutting or nicking you have to be a moron to cut yourself with these the first time I used these I took no extra care and no cuts. If your looking for a set of clippers that will get you an extremely close shave look no further.</li>
    <li> Perfect for shaving down what hair I have left on my head. Only problem is my wife made fun of me for buying &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; clippers. Otherwise best set of clippers ive ever owned</li>
    <li> Wish it would cut a smidge closer.  Shaves down to a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, not quite bald.  Other than that a solid buzzer.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before settling on the Wahl clippers.  I had been shaving my head daily but have decided to let my hair grow out a little. These clippers with the 1/16&amp;#34; blade guard are just right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wanted to avoid was &#x27;velcro head&#x27; the feeling of 3-4 days growth, the 1/16&amp;#34; blade guard is just beyond that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little practice to use these trimmers yourself but, once you have the hang of it, you&#x27;ll love them!</li>
    <li> Yes, as several reviews have stated, these clippers are very sharp.  But I found that with reasonable care when using them they provide a quality balding for your head.  I like them.  Again, just be slow and careful when using them.</li>
    <li> I had debated getting this for some time... I like these much better than my andi edgers. (i&#x27;ve been through 2 sets of andi)..  I use to bald my head and these cut me head just perfect... not too long and not too close so as to cause nicks and cuts.. and they get the job done much quicker than the edgers...</li>
    <li> This is by far the best clipper I have ever used. I have been shaving my head for 10+ years now and have used many clippers and razors over that time. These are very sharp clippers, but if you have experience shaving your own head, this isn&#x27;t a problem. I had been using the smaller beard trimmer for my head and it took 20+ min. With these clippers it takes just a little over 5 min to be completely bald. The hair length after shaving is comparable to 1 day after a razor. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with these. They are quiet, don&#x27;t overheat, and cut very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the guard on and shaved my English Mastiff with these the other day and they worked perfect for that too...</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers. I hardly need my trimmers any longer</li>
    <li> Close cut and solid feel. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. I like to shave off my head and this clipper is so sharp that it cuts your skin. I bought Andis T-Outliner Trimmer with T-Blade (04710) and I love it.</li>
    <li> Really really sharp. if you do not know what you are doing or just looking for some clippers to do a quick cut these are not those. Hint Professional but definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get close enough to be considered a balding clipper.</li>
    <li> Great balding clippers but SUPER sharp.  Make sure you turn down the power before first use and gradually build it up to your perfect shave.  I used it on full power the first time and my husband came out looking like he was attached by vicious animals.... by that I mean i cut him in at least 5 places and the rest were very red and irritated for several days. (i&#x27;ve been shaving his head for 4 years and I read the reviews so I was being very careful).</li>
    <li> Clear shave-best product I have used!</li>
    <li> The clippers work great! I thought it might get a little closer cut but it does the job. I just cut everyday of two and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Best thing since sliced bread</li>
    <li> I have owned several pairs of clippers over the years including a few andis trimmers.  I am a male and use these primarily for shaving my head and LOTS of body hair (arms, legs, chest, etc)!  This shaves closer and is more powerful than any other trimmer which means fewer passes up and down in order to fully trim an area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no guard it shaves so close that you literally have to be careful to not cut yourself!  I use no guard sometimes for my face just to get a quick 5 o&#x27;clock shadow shave when I don&#x27;t feel like using a razor haha!  Buy extra guards if you need more than two.  It only comes with a super close guard and a medium/long guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is still going strong after almost daily use for 3 years!</li>
    <li> Ok folks here&#x27;s the real deal. These are balding clippers. They cut your hair as close as possible without scalping you. The ONLY way to get a bald head is to use a razor. NOTHING ELSE WILL GIVE YOU THAT BEAUTIFUL CHROME DOME LOOK. With that said I would reccomend HeadBlade. A great product and it has a patented shave guard to prevents nicks and cuts. But I&#x27;m getting lazy. I hate shaving my face every day, let alone my whole head! So I wanted something to cut my hair quickly and closely. This is where these clippers come in. They are great. I&#x27;ve used them a few times since I bought them with no problems or issues. I&#x27;m not sure how some of the folks got cut up but I would guess they were digging too hard trying to get the chrome dome look and cut themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and the price is definitely right. Chrome domes rock!!!</li>
    <li> Blades are too sharp, tears your head up badly.</li>
    <li> Never tried one like this before and I just LOVE it!!!  Clips sooooo close!!!!  Just like you were bald!!!  :)</li>
    <li> I have read several reviews for this item. For me this item cuts close and clean. This cuts my hair closest to bald than any other electric clippers. To get any closer you would need a razor. I use it on my self and haven&#x27;t cut myself at all. No cons other than the cheap plastic body. Very good price for the purpose. Feels rugged enough to last as long as some of the reviewers claim (15+ yrs)</li>
    <li> The clippers live up to the hype. I use these clippers to cut my hair and it looks like I used a razor on it. It cuts that close.</li>
    <li> I got these about a month ago and I love them! After reading many reviews where people experienced some cuts, the first thing I did when they came was to check and adjust them so that the top blade is as close as possible to the bottom WITHOUT OVERLAPPING. I did this and have not gotten cut once, no biting at all and I use them almost daily. To the people complaining about cuts, please be sure to adjust them. It&#x27;s even stated in the instructions that came with the clippers! Wahl is a pro brand but just like any other clippers, they have to be cleaned and maintained regularly, ask any barber. Do so and you shouldn&#x27;t have problems. Great product!</li>
    <li> I got these clippers yesterday,and of course, had to try them out immediately. They are great.They are nice and heavy, feel professional  and work awesome. Ive been shaving my head for about 15 years.Every time I shaved my head I was using regular clippers and then using an electric skull shaver after using the regular clippers. These clippers eliminate having to use the skull shaver every time as these clippers get the hair much shorter than regular clippers. They may not get the hair exactly as short as the skull shaver but if they don&#x27;t the difference is negligible, therefore saving me a step and more imortantly saving my time.Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase. I saw some review of these clippers with pictures of a guys head supposedly all cut up from using these.There is no way thats possible unless you use them to bludgeon yourself repeatedly in the cranium.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved my head for 12 years with tons of different $20-$30 clippers that would eventually shake themselves apart. these balding clippers are awesome. they give you the closeness of a second day razor shave. I&#x27;ve tried it at all angles since I shave my head myself and haven&#x27;t received any cuts. they are super sharp but it&#x27;s not scary sharp like some of these reviews suggest. I almost didn&#x27;t buy them because of those reviews but I&#x27;m extremely glad I did. they are very durable and well made. I foresee them lasting for many years with proper oil treatment &amp; care. super powerful yet quiet motor that tears through thick head or facial hair in no time. it&#x27;s definitely sped up the time it takes to quickly shave my head. buy them you definitely won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, but as others noted you have to be careful. I did cut my head the first couple times I used it, and was debating returning it because I don&#x27;t want my head bleeding every time I shaved it. But I adjusted to it and I really love how short cuts my hair.  I would give it five stars, but again because of how sharp the blade is it does cut your head at times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
    <li> I heard some reviews that said that it irritated their scalp. I havent experienced that even when I went angle up. Its super solid in construction and easy to clean. I shave my head twice a week and I have loved using this new razor. It came with some guides which i was very excited for cause i can do other people hair too if i need to.</li>
    <li> As advertised it shaves almost to your skull. I fully recommend this if you want to be bold. I did a lot of research and i came across this highly recommended by barber shops.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the good close cut provided as advertised. I recommend this product for anyone looking for a close fade.</li>
    <li> Bought after reading several posts about it&#x27;s ability to cut close.  I will say it cuts about as close as it possibly could since you have to have some metal between your skin and the moving cutter.  I&#x27;ve been clipping my hair for almost 20 years straight and have used most clipper brands.  Most of the Wahl brands I have used have been of top quality and this one is no different.  Won&#x27;t clip you &amp;#34;day old growth&amp;#34; as some have said but maybe 2-3 days worth.  Not sure how people are cutting themselves with them but i have had clippers that cut and those that felt like they could at any minute and I was pretty confident in using these.  They won&#x27;t cut you if you know what you&#x27;re doing.  Overall, very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my hair myself for years and never was happy with the closeness of the cut from most clippers.  This clipper is fantastic.  Very close cut.  Have been using for several months now with no problems.</li>
    <li> Blade cut mt scalp very badly causing a lot of bleeding. Poor alignment down to poor quality control. I will never buy Wahl again!</li>
    <li> I recently purchase these clippers to save some money going to a barber, because the only hair cut I get is a bald head. These clipper are sharp, Cut myself several times until I got the hang of the clippers.  I think I made a good investment buying these clipper. But if you r not ready to get cut. Don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
    <li> Cuts through hair of varying lengths like butter.  Cuts closer to the skin than any other clipper I&#x27;ve seen, after being zero gapped.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Yes, yes, yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these clippers.  This is my first pair of balding clippers and I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
    <li> This must be the Cadillac of clippers. Its quiet, cuts quite good, and feels solid and durable. One of the better grooming purchases I&#x27;ve made by far.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Great for the short cut. Excellent I do recommend for men who are looking to get a close as possible.</li>
    <li> If you try using the clippers out of the box, you won&#x27;t cut your hair close enough. When I did it,  it practically looked like a 2 and, worse, it cut unevenly. At first I was disappointed, and I went back to bic&#x27;ing my head until I found out about zero gapping the blade e.g. manually adjusting the blades yourself from youtube videos (see comments for link). That way the clippers cut to about a day or two&#x27;s growth (evenly) and you can bic it to the skin with one razor for a cleaner look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good product, but if they advertise \\&quot;balding clipper\\&quot; they should ship the blade so it actually cuts close enough. It&#x27;s kind of silly that you have to manually adjust the blade to get a decent cut and that the blades weren&#x27;t even installed straight, but it does make it sooooo much quicker to shave your head and 1 bic versus 6+ is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: Been using this thing for about a month and a half now. Works fantastic, really love it, upped the review a star. I can shave my head in about 5-7 minutes real time now with a hand mirror + the medicine cabinet mirror. Then I use one bic afterwards. Takes some getting used to. Bend your head forward when you clip the back to avoid abrasions. Be sure to use the brush to brush out hair while you&#x27;re clipping too.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a professional quality set of clippers that could cut as close to the scalp as possible without leaving any nicks or cuts.  I&#x27;ve been using this Wahl unit for almost four months, and have had really good results.  The unit itself is solidly built and well made.  I&#x27;ve used cheaper sets before and you can really see the difference in using this model.  The blades are sharp and do a wonderful job, very quickly.  So far, I haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts, which was a concern of mine, since I saw other reviews that claimed this device cut them.  Make no mistake, this model will take your hair right down to the scalp.  While it&#x27;s not \\&quot;razor smooth,\\&quot; it&#x27;s probably as close as you&#x27;re going to get with clippers alone!</li>
    <li> I know longer have to go to the barber !! I have already paid for the clippers many times. Clippers are easy to use and provides a skin tight cut. If your like me and sport the baldy , these are the clippers for you !!</li>
    <li> Great clippers. I use them every few days instead of shaving my head with a razor. They are the closest thing to actually shaving my head that I&#x27;ve found so far. I read some reviews that said these clippers cut the scalp and were uncomfortable to use, but I bought them anyway. I am glad I ignored the negatives. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it should for my bald head. Cuts very close without injury.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best investment.i enjoy cutting my hear I&#x27;m thinking of buying the next one up to see if it&#x27;s good like the balding wahl good work on this one</li>
    <li> These clippers are extremely sharp and can cut you if you aren&#x27;t careful. I went back to standard Wahl clippers after one use.</li>
    <li> I am balding so I have been buzzing my head with a clipper for a few years.  I have shaved my head a few times and like the look and smooth feel but did not want to add another thing to do in the morning.  So I decided to try the balding clippers.  I read the reviews for the Wahl product which were mostly good with the exception of a few reviewers stating that they had gotten cuts.  So it was with trepidation that I took the clippers to my head and face for the first time last night.  I had about a weeks worth of growth on my head and face.  The clippers felt good in my hand; stable and a strong hum. I used the clippers on my face first and had no problems with cuts, even going over a mole on my chin.  I then went to the head and had absolutely no problems with cutting.  As other reviewers stated, the Wahl Balding Clipper does not give you a smooth shiny dome like a wet razor shave.  I have a nice sandpaper feel on my head and face, similar to 2 or 3 days after a wet shave. This is a very good product.Please note:  lift the plastic packing tray to find brush, comb, attachments, lubricating oil.  Some reviewers mentioned that lubricating oil was not included but I suspect it was overlooked in the packing and probably thrown out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for several years and it works today just as good as the day I bought it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have used Wahl for years. Very economical way to cut your hair. When I started loosing my hair my barber suggested I buy these. For over 20 years now I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair, saving the time and money going to the barber every month! This is only the second one I&#x27;ve had to buy and that&#x27;s only becasuse after repeated times of dropping them this last time they landed just right to bend the blade mount so I had to replace it. My fault entirely! Great product!</li>
    <li> very noisy, vibrates more, i will return it</li>
    <li> We have purchased many clippers in the past. Most have been ok at best. My son has very thick very coarse hair, and this clipper slides right thru. These clippers are heavy and well made.</li>
    <li> Wahl Professional 8110 is worth the 5-star rating. Best clipper for a clean shave head. Solid handling, smooth precise cut, worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this by mistake, and so returned it. I&#x27;m sure it is a great quality clipper. I have a Wahl Senior and it has been a work-horse.</li>
    <li> Powerful clippers that get the job done without wasting time.  Oil them properly -- before AND after you clip -- and they&#x27;ll take care of you properly.  I like the thick cord.  I wish they cut closer - they cut down to about one day of growth - but I&#x27;m nitpicking.  There&#x27;s a reason professional barbershops use them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 33 year-old son who struggles with baldness (a trait I unfortunately passed on to him).  He had been using a standard hair cutter to trim his hair very short.  He wanted to cut his hair closer to the skin and the Whal 8110 was my gift to him this Christmas.  He absolutely loved it after using it a couple of times.  Once he borrowed from me the 1.0 attachment in-between the 1.5 and 0.5 supplied, he achieved the close result he wanted and I could not have pleased him more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its operating noise is rather low and the clipper appears very sturdy in construction. Wahl should add the 1.0 attachment to the kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done the clipper runaround and these are some great clippers and have already given me the cut I&#x27;ve been getting from the barber for awhile.  It looks about +1 day from shaved, but cuts clean so the hairs aren&#x27;t sharp like cheap clippers and looks sharp on any person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are excellent clippers and are rated for commercial usage, so for home use you should get great usage out of them.  Just make sure to apply your oil and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also includes two brushes for cleaning which are very useful.  In addition to the two brushes it includes a comb (kinda odd for balding clippers, but whatever), a bit of clipper oil and two guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great clippers overall and keep looking sharp!!</li>
    <li> I read the prior reviews about the quality, thought I&#x27;d spend the extra $15 to get a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; model, especially one that is called a \\&quot;balding\\&quot; clipper.  I already own a Wahl (14 year old model) that cuts to 1/16\\&quot; with no attachment, but it lost one of its guide teeth...time to upgrade.  On the 8110 model, the cutting blade is already 1/8\\&quot; away from the guide teeth!  Both the guide teeth and cutting blade are very sharp and I&#x27;d be leery to use them on my head bare.  Add the 1/16\\&quot; cutting inch attachment and this device will probably deliver a wonderful 3/16\\&quot; - 1/4\\&quot; cut............I wouldn&#x27;t know, my hair was already too short for a test run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting this 8110 model to deliver a razor close shave, but it should at least cut as close as a \\&quot;non balding\\&quot; model....for this reason and the moderate hassle of having to return it via UPS, I rated it a 2 for being misleading in the description and the pictures on the box of its capability.  As far as the quality of the cut (when your hair is long enough) and the long term quality of the device, I&#x27;m sure they are what the prior reviewers say they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8 hours later - still stunned about it&#x27;s non-close trimming, I looked at it again. The cutting blade was upside down.  I undid some screws, turned the blade over, and presto, NOW we have some balding trimmers.  WHY in the world would you sell balding trimmers that needed to be modified out of the box!?!?  I&#x27;m still giving it a 3 for the illogical thought process and need to reassemble the blade [with great precision] to make sure the blade edge does not exceed the guide edge (to prevent all the bloody results you&#x27;ve read about in other reviews).  Once I figured this out, it was a very close and painless shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&#x27;mon WHAL marketing team!  You can do better!</li>
    <li> I saw a few reviews where the product fell apart on the first use, and that&#x27;s what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made one cut and the inner blade flies off the clipper and into the sink. It wasn&#x27;t even secured.</li>
    <li> Have been using the buzzer for shaving my beard and head. No cutting of skin or anything I saw mentioned in other reviews. Working just fine so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace yet another set of clippers.  One of my friends owns a pair and I loved using it because of how quiet and well it worked!  I use my guards from my old set for longer lengths.  These are wonderful for fades too!  My youngest son used to have a very difficult time during haircuts but because this one has such a quiet hum to it he does just fine!  These are great! I would highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> Been self-cutting for almost 25 years, I have superb dexterity and am able to cut ambidextrously. No issues, no cuts, same as 2 days of growth. great tool for me.&lt;br /&gt; I see a lot complain of cuts on neck, it requires a bit of deftness I suppose but I cut ear edges, neck and sideburns and head, with no guard, aside from a small nick where I had a temporary bump, not 1 other ounce of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip for the less savvy cutters, these Clippers are like other high-End Clippers I have owned, you can lay the back (top) of the blades on your neck and go backwards, from back to front of clippers direction of strokes, easy and no pain.</li>
    <li> Worked as described, nice weight. Used without guard feels and looks like 24 - 36 hours of growth. I would highly recommend to anyone with these specific needs.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product.  It is very solid in the hand and at first glance, looks like it can stand the test of time.  The product prodes a clean shave and can even be used to cut facial hair.  I deducted one star for the power cord which is thick and awkward for a solo cut.  Great price!</li>
    <li> saves a fortune on haircuts as well as saving you time and tips</li>
    <li> The on/off switch is much better on this model than on a previous model I owned. As far as shaving my head bald, these clippers do a great job.  One pass it all it takes.  However, when using the attachment I found it took several passes to get it to be even, which I suppose is because the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on these clippers are short.  In any case, these clippers are great and I hope they last.</li>
    <li> Be careful, cuts really close.</li>
    <li> My goodness these are saving me money at the barbershop! Quiet with low vibration. Shaves smoothly with no razor burn or bumps. My son is mixed race and many clippers irritate his scalp or cause razor burn. These work quickly. They do not get hot like some clippers we&#x27;ve tried in the past so he can shave his head without having to take a cool down break. Well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I just threw away the other clippers I had when I got this one! I&#x27;ve been looking for quality like this for months</li>
    <li> The vibrating blades cut through my hair easily. I know that this machine will last me long. If you&#x27;re interested in keeping your head shaved then this is the cheapest and most effective tool for that job.</li>
    <li> Product worked as designed. Used be-ware you can&#x27;t adjust this model. You can only use guards to adjust the debt of the cut.</li>
    <li> i am a young black guy and i was NOT excited about the loss of my hair at 25. But if you looking for a easy way to get a nice low cut without cutting your HEAD/SKIN this is it. ive been using these for a few months with no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have been using this clipper for a month now..it works great and cuts my hair real short..it cuts so short that if you have any small bumps on your scull,you might have a minor cut...I love this clipper..my other clipper lasted about five years,I have a feeling that this clipper,with proper care should last me a long time..will see.</li>
    <li> Best ever. Cutting my husband&#x27;s hair is now too easy.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to spend the extra money on these clippers over the base Wahl clippers.  In particular due to the reviews about the clippers cutting their purchasers.  After two cuts, I love the efficiency of these clippers and have not had any problems.  I recommend sorting reviews by date to check on the quality of the current batch of clippers just to be safe.</li>
    <li> For the short period of time that I used the product it was brilliant! However it did start smoking after a couple of minutes and stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this down to a one off as I have read a lot of reviews about this product and have never read of this happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently in the process of having this replaced as it really was a close shave!</li>
    <li> I brought this clipper hoping to finally get that bald look without having to use multiple types of clippers trimmers foil razors etc.  But while it does cut closer than other similarly priced and designed clippers Ive purchased from Oster and Andis its not going to get you that Ray Allen MJ smooth bald cut appearance- Im dating myself by that MJ reference Im talking MJ in his Chicago bulls stint.  And as I cut my own hair obviously,  the cord does get in the way when doing the back of your head. Ive been using this clipper for about 7 months now and like I said its a good way to get close (I wont go into that one day two day b.s. hair length growth metrics  b/c that does not always match up for all hair types especially AA hair and texture) but not bald.  Bottom line is if you want to get a close as close can get without using a razor these clippers will NOT do that you will still most likely need some other trimmer or clipper to get the last bit of hair stubble gone.</li>
    <li> I am beyond imaginable ANGRY, at whoever came up with the name BALDING CLIPPERS.    DO not use this crap to cut your hair bold short.  I have been cutting my hair for 5 years, and never experienced, what I have experienced just now. My had is bleeding, from \\&quot;Balding\\&quot;, I have now a bunch of cuts on my head everywhere, and i have a job interview tomorrow.    These clippers are extremely sharp and cannot possibly be used for balding without the guard. I am returning this S*** as soon as I am done with the review</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve had! Perfect cut!</li>
    <li> not made for self clipping.  i&#x27;ve been clipping my hair down to the skin (without a guard) for years...using a multipurpose trimmer for beard and hair.  i liked the idea of the balding clipper thinking it would save time (less passes over the scalp), and cut the hair shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used these three times, and was quite careful, after reading many other reviews of cutting the scalp and burning the skin.  this is an extremely hard line to walk.  if you&#x27;re too gentle, you will cut the hair closer in some places than others, resulting in an uneven appearance.  if, on the other hand, you press into the skin too hard, you will either cut your skin or create severe burn on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;honestly, after each time i used the clippers, my head/scalp burned and was irritated for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in short, i liked the idea of these...and they are indeed powerful, but painful and potentially dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll keep looking for another solution to have on hand once my current ones run out.</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality Wahl I&#x27;ve used, its noisy but cuts relatively closely.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised! Really sharp though and will cut you if you&#x27;re not cautious.</li>
    <li> I am 63 and never seen clippers cut this good, they are great. They cut so close, its like you shaved your head. You have to be careful, or you can cut skin. These are the best clippers that I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> OK I was honestly apprehensive about buying this despite my need because of some of the negative comments of previous purchasers.  I&#x27;ve had absolutely no issues with this.  I shave my head without a guard about once a week.  I was concerned about the discussed &amp;#34;blade sharpness&amp;#34; and for sure the blades are sharp but I&#x27;ve had no cuts or bleeding issues that were not related to operator error!  I was worried about the concern about the blades not being properly aligned; I solved this by reading and following the directions once I receive it and adjusting the blades (relatively simple with a screwdriver and some initial patience).  This machine is quite quiet and powerful.  For me, it suited my purposes perfectly and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> theses cut really well</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite balding clippers.</li>
    <li> Despite regular oiling after each use I find I need to manually assist the clippers to get them moving when starting cold.  Once they start they&#x27;re fine though.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what i expected. Doesnt get hot... doesnt cause any hair bumps... nor does it cause me to bleed... PERFECT....</li>
    <li> smooth operating with no pinching</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I would highly recommend these clippers due to the fact that they get as close as can be without a straight razor.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great clippers!  They&#x27;re fairly heavy, but they cut through my hair like butter.  I have extremely thick hair so I did my research to make sure I got the right ones, and these ones definitely did the trick.  Wahl is an amazing company for hair clippers, and this product is no different.</li>
    <li> these clippers are amazing.  they get a little warm if you use them for an extended period of time. (more than an hour) so possibly not for the barber, but perfect to cut your own hair or clean up a few heads before the weekend begins...</li>
    <li> Very sharp clean cuts easy to work with get it you won&#x27;t regret it and you&#x27;ll love it for sure</li>
    <li> I had read some things about these clippers that gave me pause when considering this purchase. It seems that some had been unlucky and received units with misaligned  blades and had suffered bad cuts because of this. I can happily report that this was not the case for me and that these clippers have more than met my expectations. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing balding cliper because is so much powerfull and acurate when you cut your hair. If you have some experience in this area you will see the diference between this item and other less complex or more cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for a semi-pro hair cut with out any effort &amp;/or mistake.</li>
    <li> was using it for a while but after about a year it was dunzo.  Cant say I didn&#x27;t get my money out of it though and it did function very well</li>
    <li> I have used this one a couple of times and every time I use it I get cuts on my scalp. I don&#x27;t know if mine is defective and the blades are uneven, but those cuts are painful and dangerous. I had the old bald clipper and never had this kind of incident. Hopefully Wahl will either refund or replace my clipper.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m no barber at all, but these clippers do the job great! my only regret is not finding these sooner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head with a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Wahl clipper for 15 years and was never satisfied with the high cut.  This balding clipper is simply fantastic.  Cuts to the equivalent of a two-day growth and no problems at all with nicking my skin.  Fantastic!  I can&#x27;t say enough about this clipper!!!</li>
    <li> These clippers are awesome. I&#x27;ve been buzzing my head for over 5 years now these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned,&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning to the novice buzzer these clippers buzz very close to the head and so care must be taken when go over the same spot over and over for it will grab skin.</li>
    <li> Great machine nice close haircuts</li>
    <li> Con: A little heavy&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Powerful Motor, Very Well-aligned Sharp Blades, Hard on hair but extremely gentle on the scalp/skin, The Price is just Right both purchase and delivery. Excellent Product, I&#x27;m yet to see a better Balding Shaver in the Market!!&lt;br /&gt;It made my head smoother than an egg.</li>
    <li> These clippers are quiet and manly. Warning, they are very new so the blade is very sharp. When I shave my beard, I need a closer shave. These are perfect.</li>
    <li> I loved the clipper! perfect setup. This ain&#x27;t no cheap system like you buy at local store. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> comb the three surviving strands of my hair across my bald head.  Then I bought this Clipper and it makes me look almost as sexy as Bruce Willis (without his wig).</li>
    <li> Wahl products are always solid, have used them for many years and their products including this one work great.</li>
    <li> This clipper is great!  I love buzzing my hair super, super short and these babies can be used without a guard!  Cuts super close and cuts very quickly.  On the expensive side but will pay for themselves in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No guard needed can cut bear blade without the worry of cutting yourself&lt;br /&gt;Easy clean up and maintenance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly but doesn&#x27;t damage the clippers&lt;br /&gt;Cord could be longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy for anyone who loves cutting their hair short.  Saves trips to the barber and saves money by doing it yourself.</li>
    <li> These clippers are just as advertised, &amp;#34; balding clippers&amp;#34; and that was what I was looking for. They do the best job of any set of clippers that I have ever owned and I&#x27;m 71 and have had a family member cutting my hair for almost 40 years now. You do have to be careful as you can &amp;#34;nip&amp;#34; once in a while, but they do cut down like a close shave. I love them!! Thank You.</li>
    <li> Make no mistake ..  this is the most close to bald you will make before step on to shaving .. kinda tricky adjusting the blades when you pull &#x27;em to clean and oil them, but it do a flawless job..  reviews don&#x27;t lie.</li>
    <li> ad said new appeared to be used no wrappers or instructions xmas gift waited too long to open and return. figured barbers is used so i kept it . decent product</li>
    <li> Balding clippers has plenty of power,  but the blade isn&#x27;t precise. Have to go over areas several times to remove hair. The red and black pair I had before (same brand clipper) worked better. Thought these were going to do the same. Might have to adjust the blade or buy another blade. Overall these are some good clippers, you can fill the power.</li>
    <li> these clippers work excellent they really get the job done my wife complained at first about the weight of them but she really adapted well and doesnt want anything else to use</li>
    <li> Loved the price, this item is hard to find in IL. I like to thank the sender for sending it to me in a timly fashion.</li>
    <li> This cabled model replaced my old rechargeable Wahl shaver, which had become sensitive to humidity and sometimes would not cut at all. When I opened the box I could tell right away that this was the right choice for me to keep my head shaved. It is a heavy duty device, and worked perfectly, quietly, and comfortably the very first time and every other time. Absolutely no nicks OR cuts despite my problematic rosacea condition. I could not possibly have been more pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous buying these clippers after reading several negative reviews.  In summary, the blades were two sharp, could cut your head in places, etc., or so the negative reviews said.  I wanted the &amp;#34;almost bald&amp;#34; look; essentially as short as possible without actually using a razor.  I had gone through 3 or 4 different models that all worked OK.  Several of the models seemed to be clippers for every hair style with 10 different guards to accommodate different lengths, etc.  I didn&#x27;t need clippers that did 10 things pretty good.  I needed clippers that did one thing really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now cut my hair 3 times, each time after one week&#x27;s growth.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these clippers.  It cuts very fast, and I haven&#x27;t cut myself once.  I don&#x27;t have any moles or other odd bumps on my head so take that into consideration.  I actually tried cutting my one week&#x27;s worth of whiskers as well and that similarly turned out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly.  Popped it out of the box, plugged it in, switched it on, buzzed my head clean with no guard and no problems.  Got much closer and went much quicker than the cheapo braun head/beard deal I had been using.  Gives close to a blade shaved look but with just the right amount of stubble.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this to cut my hair every week and it rules!  We had the standard WAHL clippers before, but like this much more for cutting my hair short.</li>
    <li> People often think I actually shave my head as these clippers get VERY close. The only problem I have with them are the &#x27;teeth&#x27; of the blade. It is really difficult to get them clean as they are so close together (which is why the clipping is so close to the scalp). Look into finding a brush with short very stiff bristles for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, nice clean shave!! What I expected they would be and more. I would recommend them to anyone wanting a smooth bald look.</li>
    <li> Be careful with this product if your shaving your own head, it can and will cut you if it is not aligned properly. I wish the default setting was a safe setting to begin with.</li>
    <li> 5.5 years later and machine is still holding strong.  I cut my hair on average every 4 days.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> This is a must-have for any man going with the &amp;#34;high &amp; tight&amp;#34; cut or who would like to go as close to skin as possible without using an razor.  It is a powerful clipper yet safe blade that you can get a nice clean even cut with.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So far it works really well</li>
    <li> works great good motor, arrived on time, great product little bit pricy but its ok make sure to put plastic clipper protector before shaving head.</li>
    <li> this item was recommended to us by a barber and we were very satisfied.  Very easy to operate, but it is a little heavy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Wahl Designer for a few years and I use it with no attachments and it gets my hair really short but not bald, just the way I like it.  I purchased this expecting the same thing but after testing it out on my face I realized it would leave me pretty much BALD which is what it is supposed to do but not what I want. I hate razors and this gets my facial hair cut really close, quickly and without cuts. So, that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll use it. I will just buy a new Wahl Designer to replace the old one. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Was expecting a closer cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay enough attention to the reviews that said these cut VERY close. My head was bleeding and felt burned after use.</li>
    <li> I had used the same clipper UK version before this USA version but i was amazed. It performed way beyond expectation.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday at work.</li>
    <li> My first time using these, they came &amp;#34;bumped&amp;#34; (which means the bottom and top blade were so close together, it was like a razor blade) so closely that I sliced my face open between my eyebrows. I bought these clippers because I shave my body, and this is the most efficient way to do it compared to a blade and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the Wahl clippers to my barber, and he adjusted them for me, and since then they have been pretty good. They still snag on my hairs every now and then, and I obsessively oil them E-V-E-R-Y time I use them, so that&#x27;s a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-They seem to be a very heavy-duty set of clippers (heavy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- They sliced open my skin twice they cut so short, and I had to have them adjusted&lt;br /&gt;- They pull and snag my hair, even though I religiously keep them well oiled with Wahl brand oil EVERY use&lt;br /&gt;- If I didn&#x27;t have a nice barber, I would have no way of getting them adjusted, and don&#x27;t think I should have had to worry about something like that anyway</li>
    <li> This is the perfect clipper to make your head bald if you don&#x27;t like using the razor. I give it 4 stars because you have to be very careful or else you will easily cut your scalp.</li>
    <li> This set of clippers has lasted a lot longer than some of my other sets. I have had problems with other brands and their motors getting too hot. I have yet to have any overheating problems with these. I wish that this set didn&#x27;t take a screw driver to adjust the setting though. Though, I guess that is a good feature for a professional.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this trimmer! It&#x27;s very high quality and does get a very close cut.</li>
    <li> This is a hit or miss product. The first one I bought worked excellent but it got ruined by my child soaking it in water. It rusted almost instantly. I  turned it on after drying and all seemed well but it wouldn&#x27;t cut a thing. The next time I bought one it didn&#x27;t cut nearly as good as the first. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as my old one did (and I know how to adjust the settings). I do think that this is a good buy but based on my experience you may get lucky and get &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; clippers or you might get an &amp;#34;almost great&amp;#34; clippers. If you get happen to get almost great clippers they will work just fine but if you want to go very close that will not be an option.</li>
    <li> Works great as described.</li>
    <li> These are some really extremely close cutting and super sharp clippers. I think these clippers compliment the Wahl magic clip really well. With the blade set at #000000 or 6x0, straight out of the box, it makes for a really nice hair cut. Thanks Wahl!!</li>
    <li> ALMOST CLOSE TO A REAL RAZOR</li>
    <li> First off, these clippers are very sharp! 2nd, I have very thick hair and always had a problem finding the right clippers. These are perfect, I would have given it 5 stars but the blades were not aligned so I had to unscrew it and re-align it, which was a pain.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Does the job......not skin level cut as razor, but very close. However, very sharp, so be careful. I normally start with this and finish with razor to get skin cut. I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you want a short cut - this a tool you should use.</li>
    <li> Works very well! From its weight, you can tell that it is well-made and has plenty of torque to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise - when mine arrived, the tips of the shearing heads were positioned together, instead of having the top plate peeking over a little bit. If you try to use these clippers without an attachment when they&#x27;re in this state, they will DESTROY your skin. Make sure you adjust the clipping heads appropriately, and then tweak the adjustment screw on the body to align the heads properly so they don&#x27;t make that awful chattering noise when they&#x27;re out of alignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came with more attachments!</li>
    <li> Makes life so much easier. Now this is very close to shaving..doesn&#x27;t heat up too fast, may cut yourself at first. .</li>
    <li> It is a good clipper, you can almost bald looking but not a replacement for razor</li>
    <li> My son who is a police officer loves the closenes of the shave</li>
    <li> This works awesome! Very close cut! I shave my head and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Blade edge is very sharp. Not comfortable on top of my thin scalp.</li>
    <li> These clippers cut just as advertised. I just used these for the first time and all I have is minimal stubble with a sandpaper feel on my head. I honestly don&#x27;t know how you would get a closer cut with electric clippers. I also had no trouble with cutting. I&#x27;ve been shearing my head for the past few years, but all you have to do is keep the bevel edge of the clippers against your scalp. Don&#x27;t rotate or rock your hand up and you&#x27;ll have no problems. Worth every penny for these!</li>
    <li> I can not believe the easy for which these clippers can cut through any hair.  Unreal.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> very good, no problems</li>
    <li> Pretty close shave and yes I did get some injuries early on but after a little usage the blade burns-in and becomes less dangerous.  Just keep it level on those first few shaves.</li>
    <li> It gives a nice clean close cut for bald heads and bald fades. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> One of the best Clippers .</li>
    <li> The Wahl 5Star Balding Clipper is one professional clipper that shaves close to bald without the use of a razor. The motor is well built and does not get so hot that you wont be able to complete your cut. Ofcourse depending how long it takes you to cut hair, i would assume it will only get warm.  I normally take around 20 min cutting my own hair and the clippers does not feel hot at all. Comes with one guard, oil for the blades, cleaning brush, and one comb. I highly reccommend this. Perfect for bald to fade.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> ... Because they are better than all of the others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a set of clippers that would cut hair as quickly and efficiently as what they used on us in boot camp. This is as close as I&#x27;ve found without paying more than two or three time the price. One pass is all it takes. My haircut takes less than ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are heavier than the less expensive Wahl clippers and the motor is stronger. I don&#x27;t know if these are actually professional grade, but they feel sturdy and the blades are very sharp. It also uses the same cutting guides from the other Wahl clippers.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. There were a few cheaper models but this one feels and acts like a professional model. Only used it twice so far but very happy with the results....</li>
    <li> Loosing hair so I decided to cut my hair myself.  This clipper is awsome.  It cuts really close exactly what I was paying the barber to do for $15.00.  Has really good weight and is not too loud.  I recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> Great hair trimmer!  Works great and is quiet too!</li>
    <li> The best bald  head clipper on earth.  Experience:  * Clean shave within 5 minutes  * No need to apply force  * The Clipper requires a gentle touch  * Before and after clipper use apply :  Barbicide Clippercide Spray Disinfectant GERMS LUBRICANT Barber Hair Clippers  by Barbicide http://www.amazon.com/Barbicide-Clippercide-Disinfectant-LUBRICANT-Clippers/dp/B007FEBSMI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_8?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424373072&amp;sr&#x3D;8-8&amp;keywords&#x3D;clipper+lubricant  ( Keeps the clipper brand new)  * Now, I shave every two days</li>
    <li> Very durable, very sharp, very close.  This one is clearly provides the closest cut of any prior clippers that I&#x27;ve used, to the point where you need to be careful on not getting nicked by allowing it to haphazardly make contact with your skin.</li>
    <li> It does not cuts as close, as I thought it would. But I do like it.</li>
    <li> These clippers do an excellent job getting close to the skin. I would like for them to get even closer, but I think they get mighty close. You have to be careful with the angle at which you use these clippers, because they are sharp and can nick you. Shipping was quick and easy.</li>
    <li> The best pair of clippers I have ever owned to shave my head.  Like everyone else said, it is very sharp and you need to be careful but once you get the angle down, its very smooth.  Wahls have been around forever and have quality products and this is very high on that list.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this weekly. He has shaved his head for 20 years-says this is the best one yet!! Wahl seems to be top of the line -Always.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for 17 years.  This is above and by far the best shaver i have ever purchased.  It give a great close shave, so i can shave quickly and go to work.  Bing bam boom.  Love it.</li>
    <li> in my country this machine is very expensive, but this price is excellent ... is a good piece of hair cut ... I recommend</li>
    <li> As described, good value</li>
    <li> No real adjustments can be made on these, unlike on other Wahl clippers with the lever to set the blade/guard depth. But, you can (and I did) to some degree adjust height by loosening the screws on the blade and adjusting it by hand, then tightening them back down. Love these and use them as my primary clippers.</li>
    <li> Clippers cut so close your skin feels silky smooth.  My clients appreciate a fine cut and request me to use these to cut a bald fade.  Excellent set of sharp clippers to have to bald without breaking the skin.</li>
    <li> I took it out of the box and oiled it and turned on and seemed to run fine, until i tried it on my client and it pulled some of his skin, it kept on doing that, so i had to use my andis t- outliner,&lt;br /&gt;I think with some adjustments the balding clipper will start cutting how its supposed to cut</li>
    <li> good for balding sides</li>
    <li> Had a Wahl shaver for about ten years. Definitely got cut on those several times. This shaver has smaller teeth and not as course. Works great for short hair to shave bald. Or close to bald. Did use for shaving my back and not quite as good with longer hair. Have to go over it a couple times to make sure you cut it all. But thats my wifes problem. Otherwise works well.</li>
    <li> There is no question these clippers cut well (especially for guys who want the shaven head look).  But I have had two in a row conk out on me after, first 4 months, then 11 months.  I&#x27;m going to send the second pair in to Wahl for a warranty repair and will see what happens.  The question in my mind is: Are they using cheaper parts to make their clippers?  I have some crummy Conair clippers that are still going strong after 4 years.  Are there other buyers out there who have had Wahl clippers go kaput?</li>
    <li> After much research I found the Wahl Professional 785110 5-star Series Balding Clipper to be the FINEST balding clipper on the market!  This is EXACTLY what I had hoped to find... something akin to an electric straight edge!  I only wish I could give this item a full 10-STARS...★★★★★★★★★★!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> It takes me roughly three to four minutes to shave my head with these clippers. They do a great job.  Paid for themselves in three weeks.</li>
    <li> Way too close for shaving your own head. Left skin raw and bloody.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to use the clipper. When turned on the noise is deafening regardless of how the &#x27;power screw&#x27; is turned. The clipper vibrates excessively sending the vibrations through my entire arm. Reminds me of my rotary hammer drill.</li>
    <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;Superb trimming of hair on your head. Very close finish.&lt;br /&gt;The machine doesn&#x27;t vibrate too much.&lt;br /&gt;Strong motor cuts through hair like nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to trim a beard with this machine, I cut myself a few times and you have to be an expert to use this on your face - a little too dangerous.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t made the jump to fully shaving with a razor, but this clipper comes very close.  Good power, long cord, great cut.</li>
    <li> These balding clippers are ideal.</li>
    <li> every day that i use these clippers my head seems to be so happy!! i could not believe the quality and price i bought this item for!</li>
    <li> Awesome shaving machine, I would recommend the product to someone else.</li>
    <li> Works OK so far, cord is pretty hard but as a result probably more durable..several heads you can use for different purposes.</li>
    <li> I shave my head down as low as the clippers will go.  These by far work the best and get the shave the closest from any pair of clippers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> He absolutely loved this.  I am going to get another in case he loses his!  He is bi racial and it is great for his ethnic hair</li>
    <li> I have an amazingly thick head of hair that i shave as close to bald as i can...weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the cheapest Wahl trimmer i could get to do the job because good razors are expensive. I recently dropped and broke my cheap trimmer, shopping for a replacement that does a better job was confusing...this came today after two weeks of hair growth, almost two inches for me, i took it out of the box and in three minutes was back down to skin...very powerful, very sharp, very fast, and super close with the 6x0 steel guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to cut too quickly using the trimmers, it often scrapes my scalp up a bit, i need to slow down with it. I wish they would spend a little more time polishing and smoothing the outer edges on the guard. I don&#x27;t use the plastic adapters that tend to be a lot gentler on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned that there is a different type of electric clipper available, Most, like this one, use a vibrating head design that heats up quickly, the other type is a rotary cutter. The rotary cutter is supposed to be much smoother and stay cooler...i don&#x27;t know as i&#x27;ve never used one. The price on the rotary system is over a hundred dollars and so is out of my price range...i would like to try one some day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For decades i enjoyed trips to the barber shop, the main reason was the aftershave they used after shaving your head...you can buy this on Amazon cheaply...the product is called &#x27;Pinaud Clubman Aftershave&#x27;...great stuff for post trimmer work!! Smells very manly.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head every 4 or 5 days for the last 4 years.  I am not a fan of the totally smooth and shiny look you get from a razor so I have been using clippers with no guard in order to get that day or so of growth look. Over the last few years I have gone through numerous cheaper Walmart clippers, and it wasn&#x27;t until the brand I used to buy there stopped supplying a head with teeth as fine as it used to, that I decided to look online and upgrade.  Not only does this clipper run smoothly, it has saved my head a ton of unnecessary irritation. There is no snagging due to dull blades, and instead of having to make four or five passes to cut all of the hair, this one only takes one or two.  It has a much wider cutting surface and, all in all, it takes me about half of the time it used to to shave my head.  I like to leave a little stubble on my face/beard area and the smallest guard is perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;There were a few reviews of the Wahl Balding Clipper that had me a little worried about how sharp it was going to be and how bloody my head was going to be after using it, but I am glad I ignored them.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is really sharp, but as long as you are gentle while using it, it does an amazing job.  It does cut a tiny bit closer to the skin than my previous Conair Chopper, but that actually gives me an extra day before I have to worry about shaving again (instead of every 4 days I shave every 5 or so now).  I have been using the clippers for a little over a month now and the only negative I can cite is that due to the width of the blade and how sharp it is, it is not ideal for shaving my neck.  While using these on my neck for the first time, they didn&#x27;t draw blood but they did leave me with some razor burn marks and didn&#x27;t get all of the hair.  For that reason, I still use my old clippers on my neck because the blade is narrower and can get into the curves of the neck a little better. Anyway, that shouldn&#x27;t dissuade you from buying these, they are the best clippers I have ever used/owned and I am very pleased with my purchase - just don&#x27;t throw out your old ones if you shave your neck with clippers.</li>
    <li> First cut last night with these, and I got exactly what I was looking for.  Much better than the generic Wahl clippers you can buy at Walmart for $20.  I was looking for a closer cut, and they delivered - with NO cuts or nicks.  I was nervous about a non-sliding blade, but had no issues.  It comes with 2 plastic guards, and all of the plastic Wahl guards from my prior clippers fit as well (I prefer the 1 on top rather than 2, with 0 on the sides).  You can tell these are &#x27;professional&#x27; - thicker and longer cord, and a higher powered motor (but just as loud as the generic).  I regret not purchasing these sooner, and hope they last many years.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair and this cutter is tops over any of the other trimmers we have ever had.  It purrs quietly, cuts like a pro.  The description in the ad calls it a bald-cutter, but it doubles as a trimmer, cutter, everything a barber dies with one costing much more.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my hair for years with many different clippers and at times I shaved my head, these clippers are by far the best. Almost as close as shaving.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews about people getting cut because of the sharpness of the blades, I have had no problem with the blades cutting me. I give this clipper five stares.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Wahl balding clipper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first one lasted 2 years and I now keep that for when I travel out of town in my wash kit bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;triple 000 blade will buzz your head with a one day growth look.  Nice and smooth and will not nick your head&lt;br /&gt;as long as you keep it clean with the brush and a dab of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased 2 bottles of Wahl oil (that should last me a couple of years).</li>
    <li> Very sharp - as long as you go slowly and smoothly it cuts evenly so it saves time because you only have to run one time - no strands sticking up.  Cuts much closer than a regular clipper.</li>
    <li> excellent clipper for intended purpose.  Been buzzing my head for years and these are the best.  READ the instructions and adjust the blade correctly and they will trim very close and no cutting.</li>
    <li> Instead of going to the barber shop every week, I now go every other week.  I am saving about $52.00 a month, and my barber feels some kind of way.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My husband loved these clipper but less than two years and the machine is no longer working!</li>
    <li> Was good for bald shaving 👍👍</li>
    <li> Definitely not one of the Wahl clippers you normally find at the mall or a department store.  I had two of those and while I liked them, they&#x27;re in a different class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My barber has a razor with interchangeable blade heads and the finest is five-ought (00000), which gets close enough that no one can actually see the stubble left.  This clipper has a 6-ought blade, meaning 000000, the closest cut you can possibly get with a clipper, and it&#x27;s very easy to get bitten if you&#x27;re not careful about your angle of attack.  My scalp gets some red stripes that take a day to subside if I get lazy and raise it up towards vertical to get right down to the skin on the first pass, it&#x27;s been bad enough that I actually peeled like a sunburn one weekend.  The first time you use this clipper should be on the beginning of a full weekend when you don&#x27;t have plans in case you get a burn like that.  It did not make me break out at all, though, but I think that has more to do with keeping your tools clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a great clipper for when you want to be able to get that shaved finish without the effort.  For smooth skin, it just works, and it&#x27;ll do your head in ten minutes without rushing, which I think is necessity considering how much effort it actually takes to have the ultimate in low-effort hair-dos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must, must, MUST coat the entire blade with WD-40 after rinsing it in the sink.  This was recommended to me by my barber, and it solves all the problems with maintenance and longevity other users seem to have.  AS WD-40 is, well, WD-40, I bought a gallon in a metal can eight years ago that came in a pack with a quality pump spray designed for it and now the pump lives under the bathroom sink where I can always find it.  I rest the clipper on an old kitchen sponge for storage and don&#x27;t any issues with the WD making a mess.</li>
    <li> best shaved I&#x27;ve ever used for cutting my hair, will let you know how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> The clippers have performed well. I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
    <li> My hubby love them!!!</li>
    <li> Man, when I opened the box and started using these clippers, I was amazed at how fast and close these cut. Right down to the skin. After reading about cuts and abrasions from these clippers, I was extra careful cutting. No problems whatsoever. If you are going for the bald look without using a razor, these fit the bill. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for ultra close hair cuts.It is a bit heavier than your average department store clippers.The first time I cut my hair my skin got irritated but after initial use no more iritation.I was a little scared using the clippers based on reviews which mentioned cuts to the head this is incorrect if clippers are used properly.Clippers dont become hot even after 20 minutes of use unlike Andis Headliners .Best pricing online Amazon .com 25.00 less than local beauty store .</li>
    <li> Love these clippers! Just what I needed as a hairdresser to get right to the scalp!</li>
    <li> Best clipper Ive ever owned!! I,ll never part with these. Im african american and these clippers cut close without bumping afterwards! get em!!!</li>
    <li> These clippers work great!  Great for cutting all the way down to the scalp.  Be careful these are very sharp!</li>
    <li> Best clippers! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected, but good enough.  I expected a much closer &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; that these clippers are capable of providing.  Those whose reviews say they cut themselves must&#x27;ve really been pressing hard at a vertical angle to do so.  In a word, &amp;#34;adequate.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This shaver is one tough cookie! I use it to shave my head 2-3 times a month. Use it to trim my dog&#x27;s hair. Use it to straighten my beard. It&#x27;s really a very versatile and quick shaver. Needs no maintenance. About once a month, I run a drop of oil along the blades. It gets beat up too. I leave it in my garage, so it&#x27;s constantly covered in sawdust, dirt, grime, etc. and it keeps trucking. Easily the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought, beating out models over $200 regularly.</li>
    <li> After some time using this it now rips hair out as it cuts more and more often. Mostly because it must be used MUCH slower than when it was bought. Will be getting something else soon. Not another one of these.</li>
    <li> Finally a clipper that cuts even!!! I bought so many clippers that just didn&#x27;t cut at all or didn&#x27;t cut even. The Wahl 8110 got the job done at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Love the cut length it is very close. The edge is very sharp for an electric clippers. I didnt realize until afterward I marked up the back of my neck pretty bad. I shave my own head so I go over my head multiple times. Anywhere you have unevenbumps on your head this will ccatch them so be careful. Also you have to go slower using these. So in short keep blade flat and go slow. Clippers did come with two guards, oil, razor brush, and  comb. I reccomend having razor burn aftershave on hand for your neck line if you cut your own hair.  Update- can&#x27;t use due to tearing up my scalp which stayed visible well over a week. Giving them away.</li>
    <li> I have minimal hair however it grows like wildfire.&lt;br /&gt;Why pay 13.00 every 2 weeks when I can have my wife buzz me!</li>
    <li> Gone thru 3 pair.  They do well at first.  Blades wear out fast and start to cut you.  Not durable. First 2 broke.  Third started to cut my head after about 30 uses.  To keep head shaved you use these 2-3 times per week.  Rep blades are 25 bucks.  Going with Andis or Oster this time.  It&#x27;s possible 000000 blade is just too close for my shape of head.  Gonna stick with 000 trimmers for awhile.</li>
    <li> Great clippers do exactly as it says</li>
    <li> Got sick of getting bumps and ingrown hairs by razor blades and electric shavers. This will not cut you razor smooth it will leave you will stubble but its a trade off for no irritation or bumps. If you are having this problem and want the closet cut possible with no bumps or ingrown hairs try this. I plan to use it every other day. Make sure you read the manual it tells how to set the blades.</li>
    <li> so far its good product i dont need a shaver for my face any more i use this works nice and fast.</li>
    <li> Solid feel. Use it without any adapters.  Really like the way it leaves a bald-look but without the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; effect that a razor will give you afterwards. Meaning your head will not feel smooth, but still looks bald. Hope that makes sense.</li>
    <li> I use clippers almost every day to cut down the hair on my head.  I was looking for something that got close and had enough power to not pull the hairs as they were being cut.  On my first use I was very happy with how much power they had and how they charged through the hair on my head.  I was trying to be very careful to not push too hard as I saw other reviews about how sharp these things are.  Just to provide some background, I have used a safety razor in the past to shave my head, so I know about being careful and using a delicate touch.  The job the clippers did was great, but what I quickly found was that they also took off a layer or two of skin in the process.  Parts of my head felt like I got s sun burn for a couple days.  I really liked the power and the cut, but not at the expense of being afraid of my clippers.  I went with the Andis T-outliner and that was much better for my uses.</li>
    <li> Solid product..does as described..makes you bald, I had no issues with it cutting my head..just move slowly and you are minutes away from a bald eagle</li>
    <li> Very good VERY sharp clipper!</li>
    <li> There is no level for blending between guards</li>
    <li> I tried several clippers and this one is the best to get my head bald. This clips very close with no missed hairs.</li>
    <li> wow, so many people wrote great reviews....they can&#x27;t have used this thing.  It is terribly loud and vibrates like crazy.  After the first use my ears were ringing and my hand was a little numb for the vibration.  I swear this thing is louder than 90 decibels.  This is the second clipper I bought, and I bought this one because it was cheaper than the last one I had.  big mistake, now I&#x27;m going back to  the same model I bought the first time.</li>
    <li> it does the job, better than the rest of the clippers I have tried, it cuts it down to the last bit of hair possible...Try it, it&#x27;ll put your hair on a thin wheat diet!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my pair for 2-3 times per week for the past 5 years, and they are still going strong. Male pattern baldness be damned, owning it and shaving it was the best decision I&#x27;ve made, and these clippers do the job very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left my pair 500 miles away by mistake on vacation recently, and immediately ordered the exact same pair, because they&#x27;re awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t try and use without a clip/guard. You will be red, bloody, and in pain. I use the smallest clip and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Outstanding, the best clippers I have ever own so far.  Andis has nothing on Wahl at all.  I had purchase 2 Andis clippers and they both went bad.  I had Wahl clippers prior that finally went out after 4 years of usage but had drop the clippers quite a few times and they still work great.  These Balding clippers you should keep well oil like a car and you will have no issues.  They do cut real close so if you have any bumps you will get a cut on your head but I wanted really close clippers without the use of razors.  For the price outstanding.</li>
    <li> The shaver was ok. I have the exact same shaver from the UK and have been looking for this shaver that works in America as I am very often in the U.S. and my UK shaver doesn&#x27;t work. So I was very excited when I found this product. However, the shaver just didn&#x27;t seem as powerful and didn&#x27;t cut the hair as low, so was a little disappointed if I&#x27;m honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In saying that there wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with the shaver and the product did arrive in very good time so I was very pleased with that.</li>
    <li> We have used it several times and after each use I love it more than the time before.</li>
    <li> Just an awesome product.</li>
    <li> Love it. Cuts my hair just the way I want it. Great balding clippers.</li>
    <li> After I bought another Wahl, I was tempted NOT to buy the same company again, however, the build quality was much better than I expected.</li>
    <li> great money saver. no need for the barber. got a great cut everytime.</li>
    <li> If you shave your hair you got to be carefull because it is very sharp and will cut you. Its motor is very silent. The problem is it stopped working at 15 hair cuts. I did oil it so that might have be the problem but i have one that is made in china and lasted 4 times longer for less money</li>
    <li> These clippers are better than I thought.  I was expecting a nice bald cut but wasn&#x27;t expecting this close of a cut...fantastic!!!!</li>
    <li> This razor does a fantastic job of cutting so well and close that the only thing that will cut closer is an actual blade. As others have said, the blades on this razor are very sharp. So you might get a couple of nicks and some slight skin irritation the first couple of times you use it, but once get used to handling it and your scalp is used to being cut by it, you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is a very well made and heavy duty razor, and you can tell because it is HEAVY when you pick it up and hold it. That&#x27;s one of its greatest strengths as well as one of its greatest weakness, because while it is definitely not flemsy, the fact that it&#x27;s so heavy also means that if you drop it one time, it&#x27;s gone. That&#x27;s what happened to my first one; it didn&#x27;t even fall far, just slid off the sink, and it was broken and wouldn&#x27;t even turn on properly, much less cut. But as long as you are careful and DON&#x27;T DROP IT, it will last a very long time and continue to cut very well.</li>
    <li> Product USED!, came with hair and greasy finger prints on it!  This is POOR business. There need to be more quality control.</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer to bald my head, what a surprise, and it works perfectly for that. As others have noted, it leaves about a days worth of stubble, but I can live with that, if it means I don&#x27;t need to use a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am only giving this 4 stars since a metal part is showing signs of oxidation. If that happens to the blades, it will make them very short lived.</li>
    <li> I used it twice already. Quality is very good.  So far my 10 yr old daughter has done a good job using it shaving my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job cutting the hair but it is not like shaving. You get as close as it can without a shaving blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am pleased with it.  I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clippers for a couple years and wouldn&#x27;t recommend using anything else.  I shave my head for a really close shave.  It&#x27;s adjustable, so you&#x27;re free to figure out how close of a shave you want.  The description of being a balding clipper is true to it&#x27;s word.</li>
    <li> It cuts my hair very good. I have no problems with this clipper.  The blades are very sharp and it is a real high quality device.  I will recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool to get a bald head. I was worried when I ordered this due to other reviewers mentioned that the blades were too sharp and was cutting into their scalps. I had NO issues with the sharpness of the blades. I used it w/o any attachments and it absolutely did not hurt my scalp in any way. Actually this one worked much better then my old clipper that I have had for a couple of years which this one is replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
    <li> This Professional Balding Clipper is Perfect for short hair like I want at this time.  I highly recommend this Clipper.</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with this product. It gives a very clean cut and is not as noisy as other products I have used.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for me and doesnt cut me. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars except the blades have a slight rainbow arch and isnt perfectly flat like the guards so to the perfectionist, this my be a problem. But after trying it out, it doesnt seem to be any visual problem and cuts pretty evenly to the naked eye.</li>
    <li> This particular pair of clippers gets some harsh reviews from many users.  If you are even looking at these clippers you should know how to use clippers by now and therefore will not run into any problems.  You get a really close to the scalp cut.  The unit itself does not heat up too fast or anything of that nature.  I am a balding guy and have loved these clippers.  I use them about every 9 days and have had no problems.  I would for sure buy them again.</li>
    <li> Love my clippers.... Saving big $$$ not going to Barber</li>
    <li> fast delivery and a great product.</li>
    <li> I started my search to find these clippers in order to fix a problem. I wanted my cut to be more close to the scalp without the risk of continually cutting myself with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading dozens of reviews I eagerly ordered this pair of professional quality balding clippers, having no idea exactly what to expect. Aside from what I read anyway! After reading the reviews, I was also a little nervous to try them the first time. There were a few people who commented about the possibility of cutting yourself with them. I have been cutting my own hair with clippers for about 20 years and have never had a problem. The first time I use them, I did have a very minor superficial cut. The cut was near the back of the crown. What happened is that I accidentally applied to much pressure towards the front of the blade as I took the Clippers over the back of my scalp toward the back. I have been using them now for a few months and have never had another accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clippers do what is advertised and give you the closest cut to your scalp possible without using a razor. Initially I did not want to spend the money to buy another pair of clippers. However, when I figured out the cost of disposable razor heads in comparison to the balding clippers. It was a no-brainer to make this purchase.</li>
    <li> Close shave! These are great</li>
    <li> this has to be the Best clipper I have ever owned. very smooth and beyond powerful I love it. .</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver that I have found for shaving your head clean....almost as close as a razor.  The only issues I have found are durability of the plastic body and the sharpness of the leading metal edge of the clipper. I personally never use be plastic guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy a new one because I dropped my old one while shaving.  The plastic body broke due to the drop.  The metal blade guard is very sharp and will cut off anything in the way.  I would recommend unscrewing the two Phillips head screws that hold the metal guard on.  Once it is off, you can use some sand paper or sharpening stone to knock the edge off.  It is just too sharp without doing this.</li>
    <li> Good seller,great item..I recommend the seller</li>
    <li> I used them for the first time a few days ago. They cut very close to my scalp just like I wanted. The best clippers I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> i bought this and have been happy so far. it cuts really close. no issues. came nicely in the box just like in the store. and was a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Been using now for several months.  Does the job without cutting my sensitive skin.  Sturdy build quality and it&#x27;s nice and quite.  When the one I have breaks or gets too dull, I will be purchasing this same one again!</li>
    <li> Love this! its the perfect mix of bald but not razor bald. Solid product!</li>
