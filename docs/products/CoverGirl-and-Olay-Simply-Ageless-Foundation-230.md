<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had great success with shipping and all that with the seller but I was not happy with the quality of the product.  It was dried up a little and when I opened it, it feel on the floor.  It came completely out of the container which this type of thing is poured into the container so it had been setting or something forever.  I really do not think it should have been sold in this condition.  I did not contact the seller for this and I should have but I am using it because I need to since I paid for the product and shipping.  I am usually extremely happy with both Cover Girl and Olay products.  Do not know who is to blame for this but I believe the seller should check products.  Thank You CIN</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Jono BuzzAgent and I received free samples of this product to evaluate. I am a mature working woman with a very long commute and very little time in the morning for my makeup routine.  I have very dark circles under my eyes.  I use the Simply Ageless Corrector along with the Simply Ageless Concealer and it makes a remarkable difference in the appearance of the dark circles.  It takes very little of the product to produce the new look. I just dab a little on and pat it out and voila!  Dark circles have disappeared!  Both products have a light texture without a pasty look or feel.  I use a light application of these products without foundation for a quick and effective daytime look.  These are great products for mature skin.</li>
    <li> Way too overpriced since it is discontinued but my go-to product for dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have hereditary dark circles under my eyes, and have been doing battle with them my whole life.  All too often concealers just make me look like a reverse raccoon - the under eye area becomes too light, and that doesn&#x27;t look so hot either.  However, this product is terrific.  Just lightly touch the concealer surface, and pat it on the area you need to camouflage.  It blends away the dark circles very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed.  The color seems odd, but it works.  And best of all, it doesn&#x27;t end up looking a mess by the end of the day.  It doesn&#x27;t cake or settle into fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold - this is one great product.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Bzzz agent, along with the blush and foundation.  I love the corrector and foundation.  But I don&#x27;t like the blush.  Anyway, this went on smoothly, not greasy at all, not cakey, could use alone if I wished.</li>
    <li> I have tried many cream to conceal the circles under my eyes. This is my favorite.  It brightens well and gives me a more wide-awake look.  I received it as a free sample by being a Bzz agent, and it came just at a time when I really needed it.  It passed the test by helping me out during a time of little sleep. It doesn&#x27;t look at all cakey, dry or oily, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> I received as free sample as a BuzzAgent and I love this product! It goes on creamy and does not settle in the fine lines. It does a great job of hiding those dark under-eye circles and any other imperfections. This is one product that I will definitely buy!</li>
    <li> I LOVE ths product!!  I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the BEST make up, and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used ~ and it takes very little to give you the perfect made up face.  My skin glows when I&#x27;m wearing this, and no break outs!!  This corrector works like magic ~ my skin has reddish spots on it often, and this works perfectly to conceal them while making my face look natural and glowing.</li>
    <li> Works very well as an under eye concealer.  Slides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t crease.  The color is not yellow looking, so I don&#x27;t use another concealer over it.  I also use this on my eyelid, and it doesn&#x27;t make eyeliner run or crease, either.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this by [...] to try out and review. I actually really like this product! It goes on smoothy and doesn&#x27;t look cakey or flaky, which I find a lot of concealers and correctors do. It blended nicely with the rest of my makeup and brightened up the area around my eyes. I will continue to use this product. The only complaint I have is that they really need to go back to the drawing board with the packaging. All of the Simply Ageless products I tried were ridiculously hard to open the first time!</li>
    <li> I tried the concealer I am in  my later 50&#x27;s and have several large sun spots on my face.  This concealer worked great covering them up hiding most and my darkest one it made it almost completely gone.  I also have red pigments between my eyebrows and it really concealed those too.  I haven&#x27;t ever used a product that works as well as this concealer and it blends in so smooth.  Well worth the money- great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have developed some slight dark circles during my last couple of years of college. I thought I would try this product to help the overall skin tone around my eyes and help rejuvinate my look. First, I like this corrector because it is light and smooth. Also, it does visibly brighten under the eyes. Although the little tiny 0.3 ounce pan is a little pricy, it is a good deal; I have been using the same little \\&quot;jar\\&quot; for over 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love covergirl products but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have very dark circles, this won&#x27;t work for you-- it is too light. Also, I noticed that the Simply Ageless Corrector collects in the finelines after a couple of hours, so I had to look in the mirror for white lines that form and resmooth them out. Finally, despite my 6+ month use of the product, I haven&#x27;t found any noticable change in my skin or finelines around my eyes. In my personal opinion, I think using a concealer and a nice lotion would work just as well.</li>
    <li> Like most others, I got this product free from BzzAgent. I have to say I really liked this product. It&#x27;s smooth and not at all cakey. It feels good on my skin and blends quite well. It didn&#x27;t seem drying, either. I think it&#x27;s a bit overkill for everyday use, though. I have dark circles, but usually the concealer is enough to cover them. I would use this for a photoshoot or on days I haven&#x27;t slept or am really stressed out and thus have particularly dark circles. Great product, though, and I will definitely be using it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have severe under-eye circles, but the normal discoloring you&#x27;d expect as a nurse who works long hours and the occasional night shift. For that, this product works better than any I&#x27;ve ever tried. Don&#x27;t be afraid of the color, as it doesn&#x27;t look nearly as yellow in person as it did to me in the stock image. Doesn&#x27;t completely erase the dark shadows, but offers good to great coverage. You&#x27;ll want to hang on to that old stick of concealer you have though, as this doesn&#x27;t do much for the occasional blemish that pops up.</li>
    <li> blendable, but you have to play with it a bit to get it to work just right. still worth the money to buy!!</li>
    <li> Good coverage and very moist consistancy.  Cover Girl teaming up with Olay is a very  good match! The yellow tone of the concealer  seems to work well on dark circles.</li>
    <li> I was stuck on the bare minerals concealer and foundation for years but I&#x27;m so glad I switched to this product! At first using the sponge was a little weird but once you get the right method to apply it then it blends perfectly into your skin. I don&#x27;t have dark undereyes or fine lines but the concealer works great for uneven, redness, or blemishes. After applying the concealer/foundation it&#x27;s best to use a loose power and lightly apply a layer to set the makeup. then after that I use a little bronzer and blush since the concealer leaves such a matte finish. I have never got complements on my skin but since adding this makeup to my routine people ask me all the time what makeup I use! Go buy this makeup!</li>
    <li> I been using this product since i got it being a BUZZAGENT .. i have brown skin with dark brown spots and some acne marks i have to use some concelear to hide them ... after using these products ..using concelear then foundation and finishing with blush it makes skin look real good. the reason to use the same brand products because they compliment each oyher and blend very well .. the difference is visible..</li>
    <li> My best advice-Keep your receipt! This product has a money back guarantee and is returnable for a refund from any store including Amazon. This product is the thickest, cakiest, driest product I have ever tried. I used the smallest amount possible and it went on crumbly and flaky. I tried it again with more product and, it was a caked on mess. Reminded me of theatre makeup we used in college, and the maximum coverage paste from Merle Norman, which does have its place for unusual skin problems. No, I did not use a primer or spackle first. Perhaps with a silicone base under it.....I don&#x27;t know anything about Bzz agents, but I do hope those who didn&#x27;t like the product are free to say so, just like all those who did like it, who wrote reviews here. I have been using Bare Minerals for a few years and just a touch, and I mean TOUCH of that covers all my flaws with no caking, streaking or build-up. I do not use a lot as they do on the demos-that made me look like a plastic doll, but used very sparingly it looks very natural. [[ASIN:B001VA8PWI Bare Escentuals bareMinerals 9-Piece Get Started Value Kit Medium/Medium Beige]]. P,S, I could not find any sponge as indicated in the info.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this ! I recommend this to everyone amazing for highlight or concealing ! :) I might just buy another :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had dark circles. There are endless products that claim to lessen the appearance of them or cover them up and I&#x27;ve tried everything I can get my hands on. It&#x27;s a difficult area to cover because of creasing and caking. I&#x27;ve tried other products that use yellow pigment to combat the circles and nothing has looked natural. If they work to cover the circles, they always seem to look completely unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this product on the recommendation of a friend. The yellow tint is very subtle, so it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of makeup to blend it. It took a couple of tries for me to learn how to use it most effectively. For me, it works best when used in a very small amount. I don&#x27;t need to use much to get my dark circles to disappear. It goes on very smooth, which could have something to do with the Olay. I let it sit for about 10 seconds then put a tiny bit of concealer over the top to blend. I found that the less I use the better. I&#x27;m sure that whatever you use on top of it makes a difference, so some experimentation could be required. But for me, this product doesn&#x27;t crease and looks much more natural than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It also doesn&#x27;t take as much time as other things I&#x27;ve tried because it&#x27;s so easy to blend and goes on so smooth. Before this I would spend way too much time trying my best to make my under-eye concealer look natural by using a bevy of different products. This is the first thing I&#x27;ve found that can cover my dark circles without looking like I&#x27;ve caked on a bunch of makeup. People have been telling me how \\&quot;well rested\\&quot; I look. After all of the money I&#x27;ve wasted buying expensive department store brands just to be disappointed, I can&#x27;t believe I finally found something that works that&#x27;s so inexpensive. Until the day comes that science can cure my dark circles, I will definitely stick with this product!</li>
    <li> I really liked this concealer. Just like the product says, it does not settle into fine lines, it lays softly over them. I was able to hide some wicked dark under-eye circles, and did not have a caked-on look! All of the Simply Ageless products are very light weight and smooth. I love the way it feels when I wash my face, I do not feel like I am scrubbing off a mask, it feels like I am washing an already clean face.</li>
    <li> I received this corrector for free as part of a promotion through Bzzz Agent. I have to say, I honestly LOVE this product. Having the ribbon of Olay running through the pot makes it go on with a silky smoothness I have not found in similar products.  It covers everything with out feeling heavy or cakey at all.     I will say, I was not a fan of all the product sent to me free in this Simply Ageless line, but the corrector is one that will be a staple in my makeup bag from now on! You could almost use it in place of a foundation.</li>
    <li> I normally use a mineral concealer and foundation and for some reason, it really sits in all of my fine lines and makes me look older and this is not a good look!  The Covergirl and Olay corrector doesn&#x27;t do that at all.</li>
    <li> I had the chance to test this product free from bzz agent along with three others from CoverGirl and the Olay Simply Ageless line.  The Corrector is my favorite and really truely works!  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines under the eyes.  It covers dark circles perfectly too.  It has just the perfect hint of a yellow undertone to cover those dark circles and the olay formula makes the makeup stay out of those little lines.  I actually used this to correct other spots too.  But I do have a yellow undertone to my skin.  This corrector would work for concealer on olive/yellow undertone skin.  I liked the whole line, but this made the greatest impact of all.  I am going to buy this as my new concealer :)  I found a great new product.</li>
    <li> Like some of the reviewers on here I also volunteered to be a BzzAgent for COVERGIRL &amp; Olay Simply Ageless products. After seeing the commercials that Ellen did on TV for these products I couldn&#x27;t wait to try them. When my package arrived I first tried out the corrector and concealer. I was a bit concerned as at first glance the corrector I received is.... well very yellow looking in the container. Once on a brush or your finger it is a milder color- but still yellow. Alone the corrector is a bit too much for my own skin tone- but if I use it sparingly and lightly dust the area with my regular MAC Foundation then it does become something I can use for my upcoming professional head shots- but it is too much on my skin tone alone to use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the time to find the perfect color match to your skin tone then this product would be for you! As I said earlier the samples I got did not match my own skin tone ( I suspect I would have had a different opinion if they had matched it) but I have to point out that the concealer did look amazing on some of my friends who are of Mediterranean decent.</li>
    <li> I have read the other customer reviews and I am glad that this product worked for them, unfortunately it did not work for me.  I am 31 years old with dark eye circles that I have had most of my life, so I am always searching for the next best concealer.  I tried this in the hopes that the eye-wrinkle cream in it would correct and prevent the fine lines that are developing.  Unfortunately, the product settled into those little fine lines--accentuating them--and proceeded to crease and crack, which made me look 10 years older than I am.  It may be considered affordable in relation to many beauty products out there, but I do not earn the kind of money to spend $12.00 on something that does not work.  If you do buy this product, keep the receipt since you might--like me--have to take it back.</li>
    <li> This is the best corrector I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on lovely and smooth.  Excellent coverage without looking cakey.  Perfect shade for fair skin.  I will be buying lots more of this!!</li>
    <li> I got this for under-eye circles and general redness on my cheeks. It didn&#x27;t really help for either - I already have other makeup that works better which was a disappointment. It also takes awhile to set/dry, and putting more on doesn&#x27;t seem to provide more coverage. It made me breakout as well when I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in months. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every concealer out there for my aging dark circled eyes. I used this under my Lancome waterproof concealer and man...it made a difference! Doesn&#x27;t crease and it looks great. I&#x27;ve heard its discontinued and that breaks my heart. I always catch on too late.</li>
    <li> i use the foundation and concealer i am 19 have dry skin and nothing worked it would always flake off i have natural dark circles like i got punched in the face and this covers it perfectly i only use the sponge for my forehead and cheeks the rest i use a concealer brush feels like you have nothing on for the ppl that say id dosent work might just be your skin type</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much. I have tried several brands and this one was one of the best. I prefer this over Yves Saint Laurent&#x27;s Touche Eclat, Covergirl Corrector is ten times better and cheaper. Still not the best of all, though, but very good.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased when I first used this product, it covered very well but not obviously and evened out skin tone nicely, Plus I love that it has sunscreen. However after about a week the product, which is really a lot less then other foundation brands, started to get dry and went on much harder and made my skin look dry. I kept the lid on tightly, so I&#x27;m disappointed that I&#x27;ll have to throw out whats left. To expensive and wasteful, and it had such promise when new...very disappointed.</li>
    <li> same number on the package that i had purchased in the store many times, totally different color  i am not at all happy</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use to much I love this product because after all my make up is on it makes a look around my eyes that make them look bright and young</li>
    <li> After searching every pharmacy and cosmentic isle, I just about gave up on finding the CoverGirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Corrector. I am so happy that it is offered here because I cannot live without this product.  If you have age spots or freckles that you need to cover, you must try this product.  I hope CoverGirl never stops making this concealer because after 30 years of cosmetic usage this happens to be one of the best. I would recommend this for any woman over the age of 40. Try applying it with a makeup brush and you will get just the right coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since it was introduced and I LOVE IT!!!  Unfortunately, it has been DISCONTINUED by the manufacturer!!!!!  I ordered 4 at a great price to keep me covered until I find another product that does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great price Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very good product for under eye coverage. Covers well and does settle into creases. I wish&lt;br /&gt;cover Girl would bring this product back!</li>
    <li> This yellow toned corrector is one of the worst beauty buys I&#x27;ve ever made. The color looks fake, it feels really greasy like cheap hand lotion, and if you have ANY pinkness to your undertone it makes you look a little ill.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and have been using it for three years.. Great light coverage and stays on throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Just be careful about the color. This color is WAY too light for me and I&#x27;m on the fair side.  I like the 215 better.  Nice and creamy and goes on very nicely.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that often that a product comes along that is all that it says it is.  The coverage of this product is wonderful.  It has a light feeling and seems to truly \\&quot;float\\&quot; over the skin. I have several of the products from this line and am very pleased with them all.</li>
    <li> I received this product free to be a tester from Bzzz Agent.  I was very excited to try it and had actually been wanting to buy it.  This product is great.  I am middle aged and it does not settle into wrinkles and is light and covers well enough that I don&#x27;t need to use concealer over it if I don&#x27;t want to.  I have hollows under my eyes, not bags and this works well for that.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and it works.  I bought one and this is my second one, it last a long time.  I like CoverGirl and I like Olay, together they make a good product.  I would buy from this seller again.  It was wrapped well and delievered fast.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years, and it was the only concealer that I have used that really worked on my dark circles.  I was so disappointed when it was discontinued by Cover Girl, and was pleased to find that I could get it through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I just love the new COVER GIRL Simply Ageless Corrector, (Yellowish base) It does a great job on toning down discolorations &amp; redness with good coverage that is not obvious on me. (Sad to see the pancake concealer - Prescriptives go, it was great).   The Corrector did not contribute to oil production   I could almost wear the corrector alone, good yellow base but not garish! I use it all over areas of my face - not just for under the eye. I in fl. where make up is a challenge because of the heat.  This product workrd fine did not melt off. I have a couple fine lines and this corrector does not settle in them so that is a plus plus +++++!  A winner here!  Even though I was not a beach go&#x27;er I never used sunscreen on my face as a daily regiment till I was smarter &amp; in my 30&#x27;s - I am 50 now. So I have a couple sun spots on my drivers side cheek &amp; A WARNING TO ALL  (Lazer didn&#x27;t even get rid of them!)  please use sunscreen even when you are just going down the street to the store!   Also the Cover Girl Olay Simply Ageless Foundation solid pancake type (peppermint style looking) is very nice.  I bought it in one of the lighter beige colors that was more yellowish looking (Pink tones just are awful on me)  The color go&#x27;s on a little lighter then what it looks like in the container.  It covers well without caking and did not look like I had make up on, it was weightless and matte. The sponge applicator worked great as you can easily dab on more where you need it &amp; it blends nicely too! It is so nice to get a shade that works. The color choices are so much nicer then years ago all the lighter colors always had such a pink cast to them, I always had to buy liquid to mix a darker beige-y color with the ivory which was always a little too light and pinkish for me.  The concealer &amp; foundation work well together - they blend together just fine.  Some correctors - concealers stand out &amp; show through under your base. COVER GIRL Simply Ageless Corrector does not. I recommend it</li>
    <li> As a Buzzagent I was lucky to be selected to try a this product at no cost.  After having used for a couple of days (learning the ins/outs of an unfamiliar product) I have not been too impressed with the coverage of the corrector, the creamy texture of the product appears shiny/wet looking (I have dark circles under eyes and darkness along side of my nose)      But in all fairness used with the concealer &amp; foundation it does help lighten/cover my dark circles.  I will continue using this product in combination with the concealer &amp; foundation.</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer I have ever found. I don&#x27;t know why Cover Girl discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. That&#x27;s why I searched for and purchased it! However, I was a little disappointed when I received my order. The seal of the container was broken (clearly had been opened at one time) and the content looked a little dried out. I guess this was to be expected, since Cover Girl has discontinued this product, so it was probably old(er). But, like I said, I really love this concealer, so I kept it and use it every day.</li>
    <li> Covers all my blue lines and age spots with ease, good product and you can&#x27;t beat the cover name. I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> love, love this product  shipping was fast</li>
    <li> CoverGirl simply ageless corrector does a good job covering up imperfections without looking like you have makeup on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using CoverGirl corrector to conceal a few brown sun spot on the driver&#x27;s side and an occasional pimple. It goes on smoothly and does not shine.  I use the sponge applicator and it does a nice job blending the makeup.  I use the yellowish base in the winter, as it looks more natural to me in the winter on my pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking in the mirror I see a glimpse of a younger looking me. My skin looks smoother, fresher, more even-toned. The age spots, wrinkles and various other imperfections of unknown origin -- all proof of my time on the planet -- are still there, telling their stories, but in whispers now, not screams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> I thought this would help cover the dark circles that I have around me eyes. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t matter how much sleep I get, it&#x27;s genetic. It does help a tiny bit but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped. It&#x27;s a very subtle difference.</li>
    <li> This product is actually more of a concealer and I wouldn&#x27;t call it a foundation, but it works just as well as the concealers that are sold at department cosmetic counters.  If you don&#x27;t like it, you can also return it just the same.</li>
    <li> Ths shade is very light and orange. I am beginning to think that everyone else has orange skin except me. The foundation is cakey and dry and thick looking.</li>
    <li> i have been using Mary Kay&#x27;s yellow base concealer UNDER my dermablend concealer to neutralize the dark circles. i dont really have dark circles, but i like a good fresh contour around the eyes when i do makeup. MK&#x27;s always been a good product even if i am not particularly a MK girl.&lt;br /&gt;i came across that corrector while looking for a concealer to wear at the GYM where i dont use dermablend. i had Maybelline&#x27;s mousse concealer which was wonderful but i wanted to try something new. i bought the Olay/CG concealer (so so, not bad) AND the corrector. well i found out that if you use the corrector like you are supposed to (under the concealer),  you arent going to see any improvement. you need to apply the CONCEALER FIRST over your moisturizer, then dust some Silica powder on top of it (which is what i use all over my face from Coastalscents ar $4.5 - it is a must have). THEN apply the corrector OVER the silica powder so it really stays on and offers a better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this means that this corrector isnt pigmented enough to really conceal. they could have done a better job with it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Yeloow corrector cream - I tend to have dark circles under my eyes and some rosacea on my face. This works great under foundation makeup. My only problem is that it dries out too fast. Smooth and creamy to begin with, but eventually gets hard and cracks. I have yet to get to the bottom of a pot.</li>
    <li> It covers well, though I don&#x27;t think it avoids settling into wrinkles</li>
    <li> a product that adds beauty and takes care of your skin..  what a nice combination,  covergirl and olay! couldn&#x27;t get any better than this!</li>
    <li> I am a light-medium olive complexion w/very dark circles under my eyes, inherited from my Papa.  This is the ONLY product &amp; shade that covers my dark circles!  Sooo glad I found this after years &amp; years of trial &amp; error!  After washing &amp; moisturizing I apply my medium nude base &amp; then use my ring fingertips to lightly, but thoroughly dab under my eyes, going down just a bit to blend with the base applied &amp; it blends beautifully -- better than any others I&#x27;ve tried. I also dab what&#x27;s left on my fingertips on my lid as a matching base.  After applying blusher, but before addressing my eyes &amp; eyebrows, I apply loose transparency powder to my face with a large brush (including under &amp; over my eyes) for a final lovely blending &amp; set.  Ladies, if you have dark circles &amp; have been fighting to cover them, you HAVE to try this product. *-*</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it said and doesnt look like your wearing a ton of cover. This is now a staple in my make up kit.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find this item in the stores now and it is the only thing that covers my dark circles. Love it.</li>
    <li> My wife has happily used it for years.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be just what I wanted. very creamy and easy to apply. It covered my dark circles very well</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s too oily and i couldn&#x27;t wear it because i thought i got the right shade but it was too yellow</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well for under eye concealer or brightener.  Easy to apply and stays on great all day.</li>
    <li> Received it broken and melted.</li>
    <li> I am an insomniac- I do not get a full night&#x27;s sleep EVER.&lt;br /&gt;I also have very olive skin that is impossible to find a decent concealer to match and on top of all of this there is very little time to get ready in the morning- I get (maybe) five minutes before someone is banging at the door demanding attention.&lt;br /&gt;So those beauty advice articles and products that say &amp;#34;allow ten minutes&amp;#34; HAH, shows how much experience those editors and experts have- Five minutes tops for everything- shower, toothbrush, hair, dressing and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;This product is my favorite, my necessity, a holy grail: I love the eye cream swirled in- it is creamy, not greasy, smooth, soft and best of all opaque. No dark circles. No wrinkles or creases, it isn&#x27;t a hideous white or a garish calamine pink but a subtle honeyed yellow that neutralizes the dark circles, does not budge in extreme cold or heat, does not make me teary eyed and and has me looking professional and fully rested faster than anything else out there at an affordable price point. I love it.</li>
    <li> nice drugstore corrector, but I still love high end products for under eye circles, and right now i&#x27;m really loving kevyn aucoin sensual skin, it is the best corrector you are going to try.</li>
    <li> I just wish covergirl had not discontinued this corrector.  I have yet to find another corrector that covers like this one did.  If anyone knows of another brand that works as well, please let me know :)</li>
    <li> Nice feel, adequate coverage, but nothing new really.  These products are expensive, and I really don&#x27;t see the correlating benefit.</li>
    <li> I really liked this at first, but now the cream is starting to crack and get dry. I haven&#x27;t had it long at all. This happens with the foundation also. They really need to fix this problem. I always make sure the cap is on tight so that is not the problem. Otherwise, it covers great.</li>
    <li> Makes a nice coverup and feels light on the skin</li>
    <li> Would recommend it for those who need full coverage and have no wrinkles at all as the product is heavy.</li>
    <li> it def brightened my hereditary dark eye circles which make me look like a zombie but its so dry and cakey, which for me is no better. half way thru and its dried out,already look for a replacement. i wouldnt buy it again.</li>
    <li> Entregado en el tiempo indicado y con las caracteristicas requeridas&lt;br /&gt;Vendededor recomendado.&lt;br /&gt;Mi esposa esta  muy satisfecha con el producto</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product however as my skin gets older it shows the wrinkles. I really need a liquid at this stage in my life.</li>
    <li> I have been using one like it for quite some time now and it&#x27;s running out, so I bought another on amazon.  I know it is a good product, does its job.</li>
</ol>
