      <li>smells pretty good</li>
      <li>It makes my hair more manageable and silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and makes my hair so so soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I love this rich, silky, nourishing hair mask.  </li>
      <li>The scent is so strong and invasive that it gave me a migraine</li>
      <li>This is absolutely fantastic..</li>
      <li>it make s your hair nice and soft and easy to comb through after shampooing and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy it from this distributor; you are not getting your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was excited to get to try a sample of amika Obliphica Nourishing Mask.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff sooooo much!</li>
      <li>While using the mask I realized that it didn&#x27;t smell full strength, and when I combed through my hair, my hair didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as when I had used this product before.</li>
      <li>I apply it to clean, damp hair and then let it do its work with heat.  </li>
      <li>Ummmmm if you&#x27;re telling me to dispose of your product that is supposedly &#x27;authentic&#x27;, it certainly ISN&#x27;T!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But my hair did get weighed down/oily faster than without, so I will not be investing in a full size of this.</li>
      <li>They immediately responded that I could dispose of the product myself and I would be refunded in full.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product thinking I was getting the full strength mask, who wouldn&#x27;t?</li>
      <li>It has an awesome scent to it - so much so that when I let my hair down after having it up people ask me what perfume I am wearing...</li>
      <li>I will most definitely be purchasing more of this stuff when I run out.</li>
      <li>It is my new favorite hair</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but my hair is very long, so I do use a fair amount each time).</li>
      <li>I love how soft it makes my hair!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
      <li>The oil hydrates nicely and because this mask doesn&#x27;t contain silicone, which just coats the hair shaft and therefore keeps the beneficial ingredients from thoroughly penetrating the cuticle, it actually does repair damage.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After the first application, I did indeed notice that my hair felt silkier, and had less fly aways.  </li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t the right color and didn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
      <li>Size is also huge- will last you a year, easily.</li>
      <li>just okay, not that amazing but can be used since not as expensive as many masks.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately some things that seem to good to be true, many times are.</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE REAL STUFF!  </li>
      <li>I love this deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair has never felt so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of it in one of those monthly beauty box things and was hooked after the first time I tried it.</li>
      <li>I use it for 45 minutes or an hour with a heat cap and it soaks right in and nourishes really well.  </li>
      <li>I really like this Mask, it seems to work better than most conditioners I have used in the past.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of fine hair, heat tools used on it daily, as well as color and keratin treated hair.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t have much effect on my hair, either.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper here than Beauty Brands.</li>
      <li>I tried out the amika Obliphica Nourishing Mask for a few weeks recently and while I love the feminine scent and how it lingers but doesn&#x27;t overwhelm during the day I think there are better hair masks out there.</li>
      <li>The real Amika smells absolutely divine.</li>
      <li>I was really excited that the sample contained enough for about 4 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair feels stronger, it tangles less, and is more manageable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with the Davines brand as I find their products producer a more moisturized and smoother result for my hair which is lower back length and starting to get some greys and the texture issues that come with those.</li>
      <li>This mask keeps my hair super hydrated, bouncy and has improved the overall texture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It is a super thick, very rich deep conditioner that leaves your hairy soft, shiny, and feeling like silk.</li>
      <li>I had hoped to buy the real Amika Nourishing Hair Mask before leaving this review so that I would be able to make a video and show exactly how it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
      <li>It smells really good and is thick and rich, so I only need a small amount of it (a couple of tablespoons) for my below shoulder length hair.  </li>
      <li>This is actually a woooooonderful product and I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>leaves hair soft and manageable plus it smells heavenly.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s too soft to stay up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it makes my hair so soft that when I try to wrap it up with a hair clip, my hair literally falls out</li>
      <li>When I received the mask I noticed it was shrink wrapped without a seal over the opening of the mask, unlike when I order it directly from the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 4 years.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure who FragranceNet thinks they are fooling, but if you have used the real product before you would know that this is not the full strength mask.</li>
      <li>It is only hair, it will grow back, right?  </li>
      <li>I have long sometimes wavy sometimes dry hair and this leaves my hair silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic at softening hair and lightweight enough to use every other day.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a MASSIVE difference in my hair especially for as much raving as I had heard about it and the price.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much, so it will last a long time.</li>
      <li>, the real Amika is a pink color, what they sent me was just a off-white color.</li>
      <li>This mask totally cures dryness, leaving my hair soft and supple.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this hair mask. From the yummy smell to the silkiness of my hair, I only use this conditioner for my curly/thin/frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> I love the way this product smells and the way it makes my hair feel. It is a super thick, very rich deep conditioner that leaves your hairy soft, shiny, and feeling like silk.</li>
    <li> Awful! Severely over-perfumed. The scent is so strong and invasive that it gave me a migraine and I had to re-wash my hair. It didn&#x27;t have much effect on my hair, either.</li>
    <li> I like to change my hair.  A lot.  Different colors, different cuts, I am never scared of taking a risk.  It is only hair, it will grow back, right?  Well all this experimentation can cause a bit of stress on my hair.  Which is why I am always looking for great products to help my hair destress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to get to try a sample of amika Obliphica Nourishing Mask.  The mask is a weekly deep treatment; there is a difference after one use, and multiple uses helps to strengthen the hair.  It contains Morrocan Oil, which is so good for your hair, and smells completely amazing!  I was really excited that the sample contained enough for about 4 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first application, I did indeed notice that my hair felt silkier, and had less fly aways.  Now I have used it three times, and last Saturday I had one of the best hair days I have had in months.  My hair feels stronger, it tangles less, and is more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silk smooth!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff sooooo much! I have thin curly hair that went through some telogen effluvium and lost allot of life and texture when growing back. This mask keeps my hair super hydrated, bouncy and has improved the overall texture.</li>
    <li> I love this deep conditioner. I use it every-other week for 10 minutes after shampooing my hair. It smells wonderful and helps my coarse, high-lighted hair to feel softer and healthier.</li>
    <li> A local beauty shop recommended I purchase this but they were currently out of it so I bought it online. I didn&#x27;t notice a MASSIVE difference in my hair especially for as much raving as I had heard about it and the price. I have a lot of fine hair, heat tools used on it daily, as well as color and keratin treated hair. Its not in horrible shape, with all of the damage I do to it, I just like to keep up maintenance. I probably will not purchase again but will continue to use it until I have finished the tub.</li>
    <li> I received a coupon, used it once and ran out and bought it.  Now this is the only conditioner I use.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely fantastic..I love how soft it makes my hair!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking I was getting the full strength mask, who wouldn&#x27;t? When I received the mask I noticed it was shrink wrapped without a seal over the opening of the mask, unlike when I order it directly from the manufacturer. While using the mask I realized that it didn&#x27;t smell full strength, and when I combed through my hair, my hair didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as when I had used this product before. I am not sure who FragranceNet thinks they are fooling, but if you have used the real product before you would know that this is not the full strength mask. Don&#x27;t buy it from this distributor; you are not getting your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product. it make s your hair nice and soft and easy to comb through after shampooing and moisturizing. I would recommend this to all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American and I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 4 years.  However..I wear my hair straightened or heat styled. After starting this hair mask...I can&#x27;t even remember what split ends look like!  I leave it on for at least one hour under a plastic cap.  It smells great and it softens my hair.  It&#x27;s worth every penny and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again after I run out of this bottle!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing mask for your hair.  I have long sometimes wavy sometimes dry hair and this leaves my hair silky and smooth.  It has an awesome scent to it - so much so that when I let my hair down after having it up people ask me what perfume I am wearing...</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I received a sample of it in one of those monthly beauty box things and was hooked after the first time I tried it. Smells awesome. Leaves my hair super soft and manageable. Lasts a LONG time. I bought a jar in late August, it&#x27;s the middle of January and I still have some left. Probably won&#x27;t need to order more for another couple weeks (note: I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but my hair is very long, so I do use a fair amount each time). You don&#x27;t actually need to slather your hair in it, I concentrate it on the ends and use whatever is left in my hands through the rest of my hair. I will most definitely be purchasing more of this stuff when I run out. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The sample product worked fine--nothing amazing happened after use. But my hair did get weighed down/oily faster than without, so I will not be investing in a full size of this.</li>
    <li> I tried out the amika Obliphica Nourishing Mask for a few weeks recently and while I love the feminine scent and how it lingers but doesn&#x27;t overwhelm during the day I think there are better hair masks out there. I&#x27;m going to stick with the Davines brand as I find their products producer a more moisturized and smoother result for my hair which is lower back length and starting to get some greys and the texture issues that come with those.</li>
    <li> Got this stuff in a monthly sample box and loved it! Smells great and makes my hair so so soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this rich, silky, nourishing hair mask.  One of the great things about it is that it&#x27;s HUGE.  500ml - Twice the size of a standard hair mask.  It contains lot&#x27;s of wonderful oils that leave my hair feeling so healthy.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this hair mask. My hair has never felt so soft and smooth. And the fragrance is absolutely wonderful. It is my new favorite hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I purchased this product via BirchBox.)</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product and was very excited to receive this as a gift.  She loves how it makes her hair feel so silky.  A nice value for my pocketbook!</li>
    <li> Fantastic at softening hair and lightweight enough to use every other day. LOVE the scent. Product leaves no residue-- just a few minutes on your hair and it makes it soft &amp; manageable all day. Size is also huge- will last you a year, easily.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Plumps every strand! I get a compliment on my hair every day that I use it. It&#x27;s pretty expensive so I only use once a week.</li>
    <li> not that expensive but just okay, not that amazing but can be used since not as expensive as many masks. smells pretty good</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t seem to notice the nice smell people are commenting on, but like the way it conditions my hair. Don&#x27;t use too much, so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I really like this Mask, it seems to work better than most conditioners I have used in the past.  leaves hair soft and manageable plus it smells heavenly.  Amazon has a great price, better than anyplace else.  I will continue to use and purchase from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I get the Birchbox in the mail every month.  This was one of the samples and I fell in love.  I was skeptical of ordering here because of the lower price and reviews that said it must not be the actual product and/or they compared it and it wasn&#x27;t the right color and didn&#x27;t work as well.  So I saved some of my sample and compared smell and color.  THIS IS THE REAL STUFF!  I have used it many times and it is still AMAZING.  Worth every penny.  I have had people ask me if I have gotten a haircut....nope just really amazing conditioner!</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as I hope. My hair still feel dry. I color my hair often and it might be a bit damage.</li>
    <li> This mask leaves my hair soft and shiny and it helps repair the damage done by regular coloring.  I use it for 45 minutes or an hour with a heat cap and it soaks right in and nourishes really well.  The oil hydrates nicely and because this mask doesn&#x27;t contain silicone, which just coats the hair shaft and therefore keeps the beneficial ingredients from thoroughly penetrating the cuticle, it actually does repair damage.  This mask smooths and softens and eliminates frizz.  I try to use it once a week or so but the benefits do last through several shampoos.  It smells really good and is thick and rich, so I only need a small amount of it (a couple of tablespoons) for my below shoulder length hair.  I apply it to clean, damp hair and then let it do its work with heat.  I don&#x27;t think my results would be nearly as good if I didn&#x27;t use heat. After the heat cap, I sometimes even leave it on overnight.  Because I color my hair every 4 weeks, my hair tends to get a bit dry.  I also heat style which intensifies the problem.  This mask totally cures dryness, leaving my hair soft and supple.  I think this is one of the best hair masks on the market.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible, not sure this is authentic, leaked all over during shipping.</li>
    <li> I had recieved a sample of this product through some of my sample clubs and totally loved it.  So, I thought I&#x27;d buy this online on Amazon.  It makes my hair more manageable and silky smooth.  It gives it body and the smell is amazing.  The cost for it is cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else I have looked.  You must try this product.  Also, if you have dry hair like mine and it&#x27;s limp this will really help with that.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair and the smell is phe·nom·e·nal!!!  If you haven&#x27;t tried this product yet, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing - seriously!</li>
    <li> I use this as a deep conditioner under heat once a week. It&#x27;s much cheaper here than Beauty Brands.</li>
    <li> This review is for the dealer \\&quot;Deal Seekers\\&quot; ONLY. This is actually a woooooonderful product and I highly recommend it! It smells lovely and after leaving it in my hair for just 5 minutes... it makes my hair so soft that when I try to wrap it up with a hair clip, my hair literally falls out cause it&#x27;s too soft to stay up.&lt;br /&gt;As for the dealer... they are selling a counterfeit product. I imagine if this one is counterfeit, their others probably are as well. I had hoped to buy the real Amika Nourishing Hair Mask before leaving this review so that I would be able to make a video and show exactly how it&#x27;s a fake. It&#x27;s hard to find in any stores that have it in stock though and I don&#x27;t want to pay 25% of the purchase price for shipping from the Amika website. Not that it&#x27;s not worth it! I just prefer to save on shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the real Amika is a pink color, what they sent me was just a off-white color. The real Amika smells absolutely divine. What they sent me was just weird smelling. As soon as I received it I emailed Amazon about returning it which was passed on to Deal Seekers. They responded that of course their products are not counterfeit but that they would refund my purchase price minus the shipping. I told them that they should have a supervisor contact me before I took the matter up further with Amazon being that I refuse to be out any money when I&#x27;m sent a false product. They immediately responded that I could dispose of the product myself and I would be refunded in full. Ummmmm if you&#x27;re telling me to dispose of your product that is supposedly &#x27;authentic&#x27;, it certainly ISN&#x27;T!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please save yourself the time, money and headache of buying from this dealer. Unfortunately some things that seem to good to be true, many times are. This product is half off here for a reason. It&#x27;s FAKE.</li>
