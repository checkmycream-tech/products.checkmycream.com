      <li>: Both women loved it.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this kabuki brush.</li>
      <li>That being said, it&#x27;s good for very detailed application compared to my wider sweeping ELF brush.  </li>
      <li>It applies nice coverage.</li>
      <li>The LAB2 brush is nice but not quite up to par to my ELF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked was the softness and how the brush picked up blush and powder.</li>
      <li>nice addition to your brush collection.</li>
      <li>Both liked the dome shape.  </li>
      <li>This is a decent brush though; just not the best.</li>
      <li>But despite the perforations, the fibers are very strong.</li>
      <li>And the block is soft so that you get the perfect grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It uses no animal hair so is suitable for vegans.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>Suitable for use with mineral foundations.  </li>

      <li>A nice brush size and comfortable handle.</li>
      <li>love this brush so much, more than I can ever say.  </li>
      <li>My observations are more of the construction, not use.</li>
      <li>more evenly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brush is more suited to applying blush for me.</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that they are cruelty-free, vegan, and synthetic.  </li>
      <li>She is, like me, in her senior years and this soft and comfortable brush works perfectly for removing makeup.  </li>
      <li>and I found it takes more work to apply it.  </li>
      <li>I have an ELF brush that I really, really love, but thought I would give this one a try.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many bristles the brush holds, but it must be hundreds of thousands.</li>
      <li>though it soaks up better, the brush is a bit tighter than my ELF</li>
      <li>is a very nice brush that I really like.</li>
      <li>Great brush, ultra soft with dense bristles.</li>
      <li>I think I will end up using this brush mostly to apply a light application of mineral veil powder at the end of my make-up</li>
      <li>Price point is awesome and affordable, there is really no need to spend over $50 on a brush.</li>
      <li>Works great with my powder and my bare minerals.</li>
      <li>They hold powder easily and distribute it smoothly.</li>
      <li>This Kabuki brush worked fine with the blush and the toner application, so in that area I would give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Overall great quality product.</li>
      <li>Personally I think it would make a great lens brush.</li>
      <li>The perforations make the fibers light weight.</li>
      <li>The short rounded brush makes it very effective at working the powder in when you use a circular motion.</li>
      <li>But I love this particular blush brush more than any I&#x27;ve ever had, because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The stiffness of the #45 brush scared me at first, but now it&#x27;s my favorite brush for applying mineral foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d actually be interested in buying more brushes from this manufacturer.</li>
      <li>It is very soft and feels nice on your face.</li>
      <li>The brush&#x27;s large size is better for face powder, and not cheek.  </li>
      <li>Both of those powder products (the blush and the toner) do not have a large application area, so maybe that is why this brush performed better.</li>
      <li>It is a soft and nice feeling brush with dense bristles.  </li>
      <li>I thought about letting him, but I like it too much to let him ruin it. :-)</li>
      <li>The handle is not a &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; like lots of them have; instead the handle is a &amp;#34;block&amp;#34;, which makes the application that much easier, and you have more control and ease when using the &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; instead of a stick.  </li>
      <li>The shape of the brush is not rounded enough to give a good, even application of the powder foundation, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I love blush brushes because it makes blush application so much easier.  </li>
      <li>This means that product goes on very lightly--though, of course, you can build up product with more applications.</li>
      <li>The brush is just the right softness and comfortable to hold and use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big and full, but very short (1&amp;#34; handle), which I like because it gives you excellent control.</li>
      <li>I have been using my cheap kabuki brush for a long time; I have liked it and it has served me well.  </li>
      <li>When I put on mineral make up it is important to me that there is a large surface of brush to dust around my face.</li>
      <li>This little brush is great for blush and face powder.</li>
      <li>This she says makes the appearance more natural and softens what otherwise might be her shiny face.</li>
      <li>The current price on Amazon of $12.00 is reasonable for a good quality make-up brush.  </li>
      <li>Holding such an elegant brush in your hand makes you feel fabulous.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft and easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>Being an all natural kind of girl, I&#x27;m rather particular about what goes on my skin</li>
      <li>It still applies powder lightly, but just a bit more at a time, so it doesn&#x27;t take quite as long to build coverage.</li>
      <li>I normally wear no makeup, but when I have to slap on the warpaint, I need to look as good as possible.</li>
      <li>So, I learned a new trick, as the box says to lightly tap off the excess product before applying.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple different kinds and this evenly distributes my powder and is great for blending all over.  </li>
      <li>The brissell is soft and strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and transfers makeup smoothly and evenly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be interested to see how it holds up over time.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, it was soft and comfortable, there wasn&#x27;t any &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; of bristles in the brush, and it seems well made and that it will hold up over time and repeated use.</li>
      <li>One liked the shorter handle, the other could take it or leave it.</li>
      <li>The size and mushroom shape makes the brush easy to put in a purse or backpack along with different powders for any touch up.</li>
      <li>Dense and super soft.</li>
      <li>It is easily applied with the user&#x27;s skill, being matched equally with the expert craftsmanship of the brush itself.</li>
      <li>L.A.B. 2&#x27;s Kabuki Brush is very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
      <li>This is a very high quality brush that incorporates a modern technology called \\&quot;FiberLuxe\\&quot;.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to say how much I like this brush without some sort of price point.  Typically Kabuki brushes are on the expensive side for makeup equipment, but now that synthetic fibers are being used, prices have gotten reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKED&lt;br /&gt;What I liked was the softness and how the brush picked up blush and powder. I don&#x27;t generally wear much makeup and for daily runs to the store and what-not I just throw on some powder and blush with some subtle eye treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush gave great results.  Good coverage and no mess and nothing heavy. The brush hid flaws and yet didn&#x27;t over deliver and leave me cake-y.  The blush was natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I WAS &#x27;MEH&#x27; ABOUT&lt;br /&gt;Oh my goodness. Another sign that I&#x27;m getting over the hill.  I wished that the handle on this brush was larger. I sort of cramped my fingers holding it.  But my daughter LOVED this brush.  Then again she&#x27;s a teen and doesn&#x27;t have creakiness thing going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice brush that I really like. Though without a price point I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s love or just a cozy friendship.</li>
    <li> The L.A.B.2 Just Face it Kabuki Brush is a great value for the money!  It uses synthetic fibers; it is easy to maneuver due to the short handle.  As claimed, it does a good job of pigment pickup and release.  The brush&#x27;s large size is better for face powder, and not cheek.  Suitable for use with mineral foundations.  Provides even color distribution as claimed.  It does not have the effectiveness of much more expensive natural fiber brushes, but given the fact that no animal products were used to make the brush, and its low cost, it is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  My wife helped with this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this kabuki brush. Like other reviewers have said, the brush is synthetic and very durable; the bristles do not break or come out when you apply the powder to your face (unlike the Bare Minerals mineral foundation brush which I really dislike for this exact reason).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of reviewers described this brush as dense--and I suppose, yes, it has lots of bristles very close together. But it is definitely the least stiff kabuki brush I currently own. It is very soft and very fluffy, and when you apply mineral foundation to your face, the brush spreads out extremely wide. This means that product goes on very lightly--though, of course, you can build up product with more applications. I think I will end up using this brush mostly to apply a light application of mineral veil powder at the end of my make-up routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a more stiff kabuki brush, I highly recommend Sephora&#x27;s multitasking powder brush #45. (It&#x27;s one of those classic brushes that everyone loves, because it is a durable workhorse that can be used for everything.) It still applies powder lightly, but just a bit more at a time, so it doesn&#x27;t take quite as long to build coverage. The stiffness of the #45 brush scared me at first, but now it&#x27;s my favorite brush for applying mineral foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I do really like this kabuki brush. The quality is very good, and I like the light application.</li>
    <li> Blush Brush.  I love blush brushes because it makes blush application so much easier.  But I love this particular blush brush more than any I&#x27;ve ever had, because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  The handle is not a &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; like lots of them have; instead the handle is a &amp;#34;block&amp;#34;, which makes the application that much easier, and you have more control and ease when using the &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; instead of a stick.  And the block is soft so that you get the perfect grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  The brush is &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; so that application is easier.  I&#x27;ve had &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; brushes, but application is so much easier with a big brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush so much, more than I can ever say.  I will always sing the praises of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you wear blush.  This is the best blush brush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I used this brush to apply both mineral make-up foundation and also blush and toner. I found it did a three star job on the foundation application. The shape of the brush is not rounded enough to give a good, even application of the powder foundation, in my opinion. I prefer the current brush I am using to this one. This Kabuki brush worked fine with the blush and the toner application, so in that area I would give it 5 stars. Both of those powder products (the blush and the toner) do not have a large application area, so maybe that is why this brush performed better. On the plus side, it was soft and comfortable, there wasn&#x27;t any &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; of bristles in the brush, and it seems well made and that it will hold up over time and repeated use. The current price on Amazon of $12.00 is reasonable for a good quality make-up brush.  I would recommend it as a brush for blush and or highlights/toner, but not necessarily for mineral make-up foundation.</li>
    <li> I had my S.O. and an in-law try this out. My observations are more of the construction, not use. I&#x27;ll post their comments as well. It&#x27;s well made, with a domed head that&#x27;s approximately 2&amp;#34; across at it&#x27;s widest, and 1.5&amp;#34; tall in the center.  The handle is about 1&amp;#34; wide and 1.25&amp;#34; tall, so it&#x27;s a stubby handle. The bristles are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: Both women loved it.  Lots of control, east to grip and manage, and compact enough to use anywhere and at any angle.  It picks up and releases powder well. Since it is large brush, it&#x27;s not for smaller areas. One liked the shorter handle, the other could take it or leave it. Both liked the dome shape.  Personally I think it would make a great lens brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter says she likes that the LAB2 kabuki brush replaces her box of different powder brushes. She uses it to apply a light coat of loose powder evenly and uniformly over a large area of her face without ever having a cakey appearance. This she says makes the appearance more natural and softens what otherwise might be her shiny face. It is a soft and nice feeling brush with dense bristles.  The size and mushroom shape makes the brush easy to put in a purse or backpack along with different powders for any touch up.</li>
    <li> Great brush, ultra soft with dense bristles. Gives good coverage with the mineral makeup I use.</li>
    <li> Cutest little makeup brush.  Works great with a powder concealer or for use with a blush.  It&#x27;s bristles are soft and very manageable against the skin. it is only a couple of inches big but it does a big job.</li>
    <li> This brush works great--as long as you like using a very small brush handle.  Personally, I prefer a brush with a longer handle.  However, I still give this brush 5 stars because it works great for what it is.  The bristles are soft and easy to clean.  They pick up blush and powder well.  I&#x27;d actually be interested in buying more brushes from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I normally wear no makeup, but when I have to slap on the warpaint, I need to look as good as possible. Being an all natural kind of girl, I&#x27;m rather particular about what goes on my skin so I tend to stick with natural products. One trick you learn in make up is using translucent powder to set the finish. And for that you&#x27;ll need an good application brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Premium makeup is expensive and you don&#x27;t want to waste it. (Tip: always tap your brush after you dip it in the powder to release the excess.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush did an excellent job of picking up the powder and giving an even application to the face. It uses no animal hair so is suitable for vegans.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, small and simple to carry. Will work for face powder or blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice addition to your brush collection.</li>
    <li> This brush is probably the best kabuki brush I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried multiple different kinds and this evenly distributes my powder and is great for blending all over.  I also love the fact that they are cruelty-free, vegan, and synthetic.  Price point is awesome and affordable, there is really no need to spend over $50 on a brush.</li>
    <li> When I put on mineral make up it is important to me that there is a large surface of brush to dust around my face. The way this brush made seems to make the center stand up too straight. The bristles in the center seems to bend rather than splay out the way I need them to. There also does not appear to be enough bristles packed into the brush. The brush is more suited to applying blush for me.</li>
    <li> L.A.B. 2&#x27;s Kabuki Brush is very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Soft bristles on a wide brush that&#x27;s easily controlled because of a short handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent powder or blush applicator!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. Very easy to hold and get the perfect angle. It applies nice coverage. The bristles are soft and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> One of my fellow apartment residents truly loves this.  She is, like me, in her senior years and this soft and comfortable brush works perfectly for removing makeup.  This is great for all ages, but I do highlight it for older females who are looking for the best p;roduct.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this Kabuki Brush, as it is quality personified. It is light weight; has a thick very-fine set of individual brushes, tightly packed and cut to perfection. It is easily applied with the user&#x27;s skill, being matched equally with the expert craftsmanship of the brush itself. The powders do apply evenly; and with a little trial &amp; error experience, the user can achieve some creative solutions in using this Kabuki cosmetics/make-up brush.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the overall look is one of smart-design, and the look is... expensive.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend really likes this brush.  A nice brush size and comfortable handle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft and transfers makeup smoothly and evenly. You can brush or dab. The manufacturer&#x27;s videos recommend dabbing. Worked both ways for me. I&#x27;ve only used an arched all-purpose face brush from Lancome before, so I&#x27;m far from an expert. This Kabuki brush works as well, maybe a little better than my old Lancome brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband says it looks like a tiny shaving cream brush and has threatened to use it. I thought about letting him, but I like it too much to let him ruin it. :-)</li>
    <li> Great bush, fine quality texture and applies powder smoothly.  I ordered as an extra to a preexisting set, and compared to my other brush of this size, it works very well.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a supplement brush.</li>
    <li> This Kabuki brush works great. This little brush is great for blush and face powder. The brissell is soft and strong. It picks up the powder and holds it. This way giving you a even amount on your skin. These brushes are &#x27;m it good for oil based powders. Overall great quality product.</li>
    <li> I have been using my cheap kabuki brush for a long time; I have liked it and it has served me well.  After awhile, as I have read, bacteria forms on the brush. Anyway, it is time for a new one, so here we are.&lt;br /&gt;The brush bristles are called, \\&quot;Fiberluxe Technology\\&quot;, so from my vantage point, I am throwing away a kabuki brush with bristles that catch, as if uneven, when I brush them on my palm swishing around back and forth; vs. the new one (L.A.B.2), which has a smooth-bristle action.  The bristles feel very soft, and the application of blush and highlighter is not heavy or blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have darker age spots that usually get discolored when I am applying blush.  The highlighter was too shiny before as well.  So, I learned a new trick, as the box says to lightly tap off the excess product before applying.  The soft, even bristles do help the application.&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, this brush is short.  The handle is maybe 1/3 the size of conventional ones.  It didn&#x27;t diminish my experience with this product; it is supposed to feel natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality kabuki brush. Dense and super soft. Great for powders, bronzer or blush. An excellent blending tool for a flawless, natural finish.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush.  The bristles are amazingly soft, and no shedding.  It&#x27;s big and full, but very short (1&amp;#34; handle), which I like because it gives you excellent control. Works great with my powder and my bare minerals.</li>
    <li> I like this brush. I tried it with mineral foundation powder and got great coverage with it. I also tried it with blush powder and the dome shaped center allowed me to get the blush just where I wanted it. The brush is just the right softness and comfortable to hold and use.

    <li> This is a very high quality brush that incorporates a modern technology called \\&quot;FiberLuxe\\&quot;. The box includes a helpful artist&#x27;s rendering of what a microscopic examination of a FiberLuxe fiber might look like. It looks like a very thin perforated tube. The perforations make the fibers light weight. But despite the perforations, the fibers are very strong. It is not easy to break a FiberLuxe fiber. You can&#x27;t do it with your fingers.    The FiberLuxe fibers are amazingly thin. They are thinner than human hair. They are closer to the thickness of spider silk, but much much stronger. So as you can imagine, they must be very densely packed. I don&#x27;t know how many bristles the brush holds, but it must be hundreds of thousands. The fibers are so dense, the brush will stand upright on its bristles. The surface is carved into a rounded dome shape. The short handle holds all the bristles tightly. You can&#x27;t work one loose if you try. The fibers may be tiny, but they are firmly held together. That&#x27;s a good thing, because you wouldn&#x27;t want a cloud of these fibers released into your house.    The very thin but densely packed fibers give the brush a pleasing texture. FiberLuxe fibers feel great against your skin. They hold powder easily and distribute it smoothly. Applying powder becomes a pleasing experience. Holding such an elegant brush in your hand makes you feel fabulous.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, I am not a makeup brush fanatic, but have a few cheap ones and costlier ones.  I have no idea of the price of this brush, as it is not listed at the time I write this, but I would guess it is on the cheaper side.  Having already owned another kabuki brush, this one just did not seem as soft or seem to have the bristles as tight together.  Plus, I have to admit, I am not a huge fan of the short handle.  Just a personal preference.  A longer handle seems to make it easier to sweep over the face.  This one seems to pick up the powder just fine and as far as I can tell it spreads it like it should, but I wouldn&#x27;t replace my old one with this if I could only have one.  If the price is under double digits, then it is worth it, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of for it.</li>
    <li> I have used mineral type makeup for years; so a Kabuki brush is a MUST when applying.  I have an ELF brush that I really, really love, but thought I would give this one a try.  The LAB2 brush is nice but not quite up to par to my ELF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No loose hairs, good quality&lt;br /&gt;Soaks up mineral really well, actually a little better than my ELF.&lt;br /&gt;Applies pretty nicely, I&#x27;ve used a few Kabukis and this one is my second favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A bit of a static magnet; it had little white pieces from packing that I had to pick off. Kind of annoying and I wonder how it affects the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it soaks up better, the brush is a bit tighter than my ELF and I found it takes more work to apply it.  That being said, it&#x27;s good for very detailed application compared to my wider sweeping ELF brush.  Still, I found this one less useable. I will probably use it as my second one in my purse for &amp;#34;on the road touchups.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that the ELF one, which I am absolutely in love with, is less than ten dollars, I would really recommend that one. This is a decent brush though; just not the best. And for such a low cost item, it&#x27;s worth the extra buck or two.</li>
    <li> My daughter acts, models and dresses up in costume - if you saw the movie Paul, there is a brief scene where you can see her from behind dressed up as Princess Leia at ComicCon.  So, she gets to apply a lot of types of makeup.  She tells me that this is an excellent brush for applying powder.  The short rounded brush makes it very effective at working the powder in when you use a circular motion.</li>
    <li> My wife says 5-stars&lt;br /&gt;My wife is very happy with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;She tells me it is soft and works well with lose powder.&lt;br /&gt;It is a soft brush, which she likes too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush. It is very soft and feels nice on your face. It applies makeup very evenly. They aren&#x27;t kidding about the \\&quot;airbrushed look.\\&quot; I like the black color, it makes it easier to tell when it is dirty and in need of washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals brushes in that past and been satisfied with them, but this brush is softer and applies the makeup more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be interested to see how it holds up over time. In the past, I&#x27;ve felt like soft brushes became coarse and brittle with age and use.</li>
