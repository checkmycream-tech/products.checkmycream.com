<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great shave very close and comfortable. Expensive but I hate nicks and cuts so I keep paying.</li>
    <li> I thing older non-pivot style razor  had a bit more vibration power but the trade-off is this does seem to get more cutting surface around the curves near the jaw line ...</li>
    <li> Yes, great price and service!</li>
    <li> I recently received a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.  Where I was not so impressed by the handle it came with, I have to say the blades a miles ahead of any of the other blades I&#x27;ve tried.  The Proglide Power cartridge uses 5 ultra thin blades that shave very close.  The blade stabilizer helps the razor contour the face without gouging holes in the skin.  A nice feature is the enlarged Lubrastrip.  This also helps the razor flow across the face.  I have extremely sensative skin and suffer from razor burn a lot.  So far I have not gotten razor burn yet.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Blades through a Gillette Promotion. I&#x27;ve used these cartridges a few times and have no complaints. I always get a comfortable, close shave. Just wish they weren&#x27;t so pricy.</li>
    <li> So, I bought the hubs a pack of these to use with his new 3 in 1 styler... and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and these are the only blades that do not give me razor burn.  I recommend these!</li>
    <li> I must admit that the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power blades give a good shave.  I even bought them.  But, even though I have no financial reasons constraining my purchase of this example of our \\&quot;finest\\&quot; technology, I think there could be some misplaced priorities in a society that would spend almost $4 for a razor blade for their razor that vibrates while shaving via a little battery propelled motor.  Do we really need this product to satify our need to look so nice, or could we feed a few more people with the same amount?  Or do we buy it simply because it is the best?  Or, perhaps we need to by this product to assure Gillette makes a fat margin after they pay their marketing people who make up an eight word name for this product (if we count the hyphenated word as two)?  I think men should stop shaving until Gillette finds a way to sell these things for less than $2.  The world would not end if we let our beards grow and reduce their sales to next to nothing.  The worst that would probably happen is they would be forced to sell their company at a huge discount from its current value to a buyer who would pay so little for the company that the blades could be sold for an amount significantly less than $2.  Could we even survuve in a world that no longer produces $4 razor blades?  I bought these blades because they are the best available, but I really do not need the best available.  They really do not do anything of value for me.  I just think it is incredible that we have been sold on the idea that we need a smooth shave.  Now we have guys who shave their heads so they will not reveal their natural loss of hair.  And some guys are shaving their bodies because they think their hair is in the wrong place or their girlfriend or boyfriend do not like hair in the \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; place.  I think our thoughts are in the wrong place.  I believe we all have the right to appear the way we wish.  But I also have the right to chuckle at my self and others who think $4 razor blades are great stuff.  I rated this product with five stars because it works well, but I reduced it to three stars because it is so unnecessary.  While this is an unnecessary product, it has no real objectionable purpose other than its reflection of how we squander our assets at time when we criticize our government for its outrageous spending choices that are driving our country to financial failure.  In conclusion, do we have the moral authority to demand a like reduction in our wasteful government spending while we continue to buy $4 razor blades.  The answer must only be \\&quot;Yes\\&quot;.  Our government should not have any control of private spending, but the electorate must have total control of government spending via the House of Representatives even with items of insignificant amounts.  Even though this example is related to razor blades which seem insignificant, our government&#x27;s thinking in this regard is they should be spending as little as possible to accomplish a specific purpose and then only when they have determined that the purpose is one that is worthwhile and necessary.  I editted this review only to clarify a point that seemed unclear after I posted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who do not appreciate the social and political commentary, I apologize.great stuff.

    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product. The only problem is that it is almost the same price that I would spend buying it in a store. The least Amazon could do is make it worth my while by lowering the price as I am sure that they get a bulk discount. I do not know if I will order this product again from Amazon because of the price.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that although I&#x27;m 27, I only need to shave about twice a week and even that is largely overkill.  I have been cursed with a lack of facial hair and only 1-2 chest hairs around my nipple region.  This is very upsetting to me as I think of all the funny facial hair I could grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I digress.  I have used Gillette products since I first started shaving, way back in the winter of &#x27;97-98.  At that time I was borrowing my dad&#x27;s Mach III to shave my sparse mustache (lip hair).  Since then I graduated to the Mach III, Mach III Turbo, Mach III Turbo Power, and finally the Fusion Power.  These blades last me (again at 2 per week) for about 1.5 months before they are noticeable duller.  Thus, this is good value (I paid $19 for the 6 pack last time I ordered.).  Gillette has consistently made great products and this is yet another addition to their fine line.  Highly recommended purchase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t last as long as ones bought in 5he store.</li>
    <li> these blades fit his old razor as well as the new one / good for gillette!</li>
    <li> These cartridges are way better than the older Fusion cartridges. Also, this is definitely an improvement over the Mach 3 razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this short, this razor works about the same as the original fusion blades.  They glide a little better but not much.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shaving system. No stubble, red neck or cuts.</li>
    <li> Great cartridges. Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite razor blades!</li>
    <li> These blades are the best ones yet. Vey smooth and confortable shave. I have a very sensitive skin and it appreciates a lot the feel of these blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m telling you how much I love these new blades because my wife is sick of hearing it!    I thought the original Fusion Power was a slight upgrade on the Mach 3, but the Fusion Proglide Power is miles ahead of both. The blades really do glide over my face quickly and comfortably, and the shave is so close that no stubble appears for hours later than with previous blades. I don&#x27;t like shaving, and I put it off when I can, but the Powerglide has made shaving so fast that I&#x27;m no longer trying to avoid it.    (I want to add that I&#x27;ve now been using these blades for months. I still love the shaving results, and the blades are lasting at least twice as many shaves as the original Fusion Power blades.)</li>
    <li> Razors are always a profit center so they are a bit expensive, but these seem to be quite a change in technology. They work much better than even the previous versions.  Highly recommend giving them a try</li>
    <li> these are SHARP!.... better price in bulk than I can find locally. Always a good product from these guys.</li>
    <li> I have been using Fusion Power for 5 years, and the Proglide next generation for over a year. Without doubt, much better shave than electric, and better than other brands I have used in the past.  The Power (battery operated) option makes a difference for me, although it may be sociological since I used electric for so long.</li>
    <li> Gotta love Gillette!.  No other brand comes close.</li>
    <li> My husband uses the Gillette fusion power.  He has had this brand for a long time and loves it.  To help the blades last longer, after each use blow the water off the razor and towel dry.  Don&#x27;t just shake it out and sit the razor back on the counter.  He has been doing this for a few years now and his blade can last up to 6 months before changing.</li>
    <li> works great, no complaints...</li>
    <li> Wonderful razors, way better to me than the Mach ones.  I just wish they were cheaper, I go through one every two weeks.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves the razor and these blades last a long time. Very well worth the price.  He&#x27;s quite happy and doesn&#x27;t plan on change.</li>
    <li> Great Item.  I Love It!!!</li>
    <li> I have been known to go some time without shaving. Always growing this beard, or that go-tee. Just to avoid shaving. Hated it! Now I love it! Takes seconds to shave, and clean as could be. Ladies...try it on your legs...works great.</li>
    <li> This is the shaver you have been waiting for!  I always find it hilarious that the razor commercials show guys who have baby faces and dont need to shave but once a month because they dont grow hair and make it look like their blades are amazing.  I must tell you though that this razor has done it!  The blades are unbelievable!  They are sharp and stay sharp through the entire use of the blade.  I have a very thick beard and it grows at an extraordinary rate, i have to shave every morning.  If any of you are out there like me the razors of the past just didnt hold up well, tugged at your hair, and had to be thrown away after a couple of uses.  After a couple months of use with my new proglide fusion power it is absolutely the best razors money can buy.  I can shave every morning now without fear of razor burn, tugs, and cuts.  Besides all of that the blades give a me a good shave for a minimum of a month and a half.  Again being a guy with a thick beard this is a godsend!  Dont waste your money with any other razors, pay the extra dough and get the fusion proglide, you wont be sorry.</li>
    <li> Gillete dos not put \\&quot;beta versions\\&quot; of their products in the marketplace, so this was a well-finished product. These blades were even better than the original \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot;, which were very good to start with.</li>
    <li> Perfect ... good price!</li>
    <li> My husband swears by the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power shaving system. The cartridges are expensive, but each cartridge lasts for weeks, even with daily use. He gets a smooth shave with no abrasions or cuts.</li>
    <li> Again, just like the 8 pack, these are a good price.  I have switched to a straight blade but when I did buy these, it was a good bargain and hard to pass up.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor and trimmer on the market. The grooming trimmer is better than all other companies. Gillette and Braun got it right.</li>
    <li> I love these razors as Ive been using Gillette razors for many years now. The only issues I have is the price and wished the razors lasted longer. I only been getting 3 shaves max from each razor as my facial hair is very thin.</li>
    <li> Smooth &amp; clean shaves</li>
    <li> i love this product,  and especially delivered to my door every 3 months</li>
    <li> just switched to Gillette proglide from other product.  very happy with clean close shave for this product.  still surprised at how expensive razors in general are though.  but if you are looking for a good shave--this is a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the razor moves smoothly across my face (with shave cream) and I have less spot areas than with my prior razor.  very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fyi--I am a guy and use this to shave my face daily.  not sure what issues women have with shaving legs and what not--but this is best shave I ever had--so if you are looking for a close shave--this could be for you.</li>
    <li> Best part of this product is skin care. It worked as soft as they told. I like this very much.</li>
    <li> There was a $6 digital coupon which made this completely worth it. These blades are really great.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a razor.  not sure how to rate this.  it works nice.  no complaints from anyone and i bought it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for 65 years. That makes me some kind of expert. I used everything I could get my hands on including a straight razor( caution don&#x27;t try this unless you are very patient). I started using Gillette blades a long time ago and tried the other stuff out there but kept going back. Then they made the Fusion line and I thought this looks good but seemed kinda expensive (I live on a fixed income) But I couldn&#x27;t resist so I got the first pack with a razor handle. WOW no pain, no cuts, close shaves (I shave up and down).&lt;br /&gt;OK but still pricey, well I got to reading the small print on the package and saw that you can use the blades until the green strip is gone.&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t have to go to work every day so I shave every other day. I am getting two months out of a blade! This is a first for me. I use a shaving cream that also comes in a jar. When you break it down this refill package goes a year or more for me. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Razors work great, and the delivery is convenient.</li>
    <li> If the price is right, buy in bulk, they stay forever.</li>
    <li> RAZOR ARE GREAT LAST A LONG TIME</li>
    <li> This cartridge is very easy on the beard and it also of a very fine quality. I recomend this cartridge to everyone. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide the the gentlest shave I have had in years.  Hardly any nicks or cuts.  A real smooth shave in minutes.</li>
    <li> No complaints - seem to work just the same as the blades that came with the razor.</li>
    <li> Positively, the best shaves I have ever experienced.  The cartridges last a long time and can be changed in a flash. The cheaper competitors are simply not as good.</li>
    <li> I consider the blades to be the best shave I have ever had.  BUT, the blades don&#x27;t last that long.  That is a problem when each one, even on Amazon, costs 4 dollars or more each.  So, it&#x27;s a great blade, but very close to not worth it.  To last only for a couple of weeks, figure 6-8 shaves in that time, is not enough.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s gets razor rash and ingrown hair if he uses anything else. He loves it, an absolute must in his toiletry bag!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used each new version of the Gillette series since I started shaving.  (my first razor was the Gillette Sensor)  I do believe this gives me the best shave from Gillette since I started using their cartridge razors.  The problem is that with each new razor comes a price increase.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor cartridges sells for $3.50-$4.00 per cartridge...Ouch!!  Thinking for years that buying the 4 and 8 pack refills was a rip-off, I looked into DE shaving.  I bought an old Gillette Super Speed safety razor and a sample pack Double Edge razor blades and started learning the proper way to shave.  A little math now...at $3.50/cartridge for Gillette Fusion I will spend $182.00/year for razors.  I can&#x27;t use them for more than a week.  In fact the proglide razor seems to lose performance after the 3rd shave for me, but I push it to 6 shaves.  I can buy a 100 pack of Astra DE razor blades for $15.75.  That&#x27;s (rounded up) $.16/razor.  I can use them for 1 week also, so I spend $8.32/year for DE razors.  After a couple month of learning to shave with a DE razor I&#x27;m now getting the same (if not better) results than I get with the Fusion Pro Glide.  The only advantage that the Fusion ProGlide has over old school DE razors is that it is a little quicker, but $173.68 per year in savings is enough to get me off the cartridge razor bandwagon, and into the Double Edge Razor bandwagon.  To me it&#x27;s just common sense.</li>
    <li> These are expensive, but they are the best!</li>
    <li> I really like these blades, but they&#x27;re over priced in my opinion.  I no longer use them due to the price.</li>
    <li> I have many different blades over the years and Gillette seem to have just the right angle on the edge of the blade for my face. The others would cut my skin as well as the hair not with the Gillette blades.</li>
    <li> Overall very good, I get a close shave, but there are too many blades to shave near my nose, which forces me to use another razor to cut those down. I see that Gillette is selling the Mach 3 Power again which I had used many years ago so I might give that a shot. I really like Gillette&#x27;s Power razors.</li>
    <li> These blades are pricey, no doubt about it, but used in the men&#x27;s powerglide razor they give me the most comfortable shave I have ever had. As the ladies are asked to do, we men must ask ourselves if we are worth it. I say I am. You can cushion the pocket shock a bit by signing up for automatic delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about a year now.In 50 years of shaving,first product I&#x27;ve been totally satisfied with(although I have to admit I&#x27;ve never tried the $200+ electric razors).A blade will last me about a month (OK.I don&#x27;t always shave everyday,but the cumulative amount of growth is the same).Even if I go a week without shaving,it takes my growth off neatly,cleanly,painlessly.I am happy to strongly recommend this product-it&#x27;s great to finally find something that works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Gillette has outdone themselves with this product. I have been a customer from the beginning. The closeness of this proglide razor is outstanding. Have never enjoyed shaving more.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a major cost rip off.  Product works better for me, it is just Way to much for a disabled person living on just Disability from Social Security.</li>
    <li> I am a girly girl and I use a mans shaver. This is the best shaver I ever bought and it is worth the price. I can use one of these for almost a whole month</li>
    <li> best razor cartridges I have used.  blades last quite a while.  easy clean. love the vibrating action of the razor handle</li>
    <li> With the price of replacement blades these days this one is running about even with the rest.  The system itself is fine, the blades do the job and its convenient to have one stop shopping as it were for the razor and trimmer.  These fight tightly in the handle and the over-sized handle itself gives me a little more grip, so at the end of the day - its fine.</li>
    <li> I have had over dozen razors and Gillette fusion proglide power razor and blades are the best I have ever used. I found out &amp; keep track 1 razor blade last me 5 weeks to 6 weeks before I have to change blade; so to me worth the price. best shave and I also can shave fast if I have to and not cut myself.</li>
    <li> Best shave out there.  Smooth blades and last a decent amount of time for a razor blade</li>
    <li> These blades are expensive, but I do experience much less irritation than less expensive ones.  They work pretty well on my sensitive skin.  It can still be difficult to achieve a very close shave in the angled area under the chin after not shaving for a week.  For those who shave every other day, or more frequently, this should be a fine blade.</li>
    <li> Husband&#x27;s favorite razor,  Could not beat the price....</li>
    <li> Excellent quality the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Best blade on market....period.</li>
    <li> Smooth and clean shave for my husband.  No nicks or cuts on the skin.  An excellent blade.</li>
    <li> After shaving for almost 70 years these blades with their Gilette Power razor and special Gilette gel is the best shaving system ever to be put on the market. It cannot be beaten for closeness of shave, comfor and convenience. I love it.</li>
    <li> This product was very reasonable for the price compared to the store. Very happy with this brand and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great price. They will last a long time. These razors are better then the venus ones. The blades don&#x27;t dull quickly!</li>
    <li> Not bad for a price I could get better deal at local pharmacy but this is back up option, sometimes if I&#x27;m too lazy to go to store and buy stuff like this then I use this option.</li>
    <li> Expensive in here ...</li>
    <li> I already knew this product is good.  So, I purchased 6 pieces again. No second thoughts on this one. Good price too.</li>
    <li> They are very good, each blade last about a month</li>
    <li> my husband loved this razor so much I snuck one to try myself. I know it is for men, but I had to see what all the fuss was about. MOVE OVER VENUS, there&#x27;s a new razor in town! I understand why he loves these so much and now love it too! The razor seems to glide over your skin like it was made to contour every surface - nook and cranny. No nicks, no cuts, no rash...smooth after shaving like a baby&#x27;s newborn bottom! I never had a razor that could make my skin so soft so soft or shave so close! If you haven;t tried  - you should! If it;s the price that makes you stammer, try it and you will understand why... Obviously this type of quality cannot be received from a low cost razor, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love my subscription I cant imagine buying razors any other way anymore! There cheap, they come to your door, you dont need to think about it theres just alway a new clean razor around and for about 60 bucks A YEAR. Im very happy with my 8 blades every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor head itself is great, if they make a better one I would buy that too!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, feels great, last for long and in good price. I wait forward for your next model to come</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about going to proglide power. I had read at so many places, how this just a marketing gimmick, but believe if you&#x27;ve uneven facial hair, this is much more comfortable than manual blades/razor. I love this and don&#x27;t mind dishing few extra bucks compared to manual razor and blades.</li>
    <li> The power blades are much better for me and do not dull as quickly as manual blades.</li>
    <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these</li>
    <li> Pricey indeed. It&#x27;s painful how much they charge for these blades. But perhaps if you double up the price of the 2-blade cheaper versions then that makes you feel better about these. I can get a much quicker shave with these 4-blade versions...and shaving is an annoyance so I&#x27;d rather get it done with in less time.</li>
    <li> When it has came down to the Gilette Fusion Proglide, I was deeply not very surprised that it didn&#x27;t showcase a stronger bind in shaving that could be better than other razors. The Fusion Proglide 6 pack of refills for the changable razor, isn&#x27;t bad in one way where they are easy to install, but they can become quickly dull only after a few uses. They just don&#x27;t have the strength to give the strongest shave possible in a longer time. I just honestly wish that Gilette can make a much stronger razor blade for all their customers, especially for men whom want the simplest shave desired. Still, I deeply suggest you keep seeking out a better razor, and better razor blade refills if you are interested in a changing razor brand like Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convience: C+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: C 1/2+</li>
    <li> This is the best price ever for this product and I will keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> OK.&lt;br /&gt;What you must know.&lt;br /&gt;The most important advancement in last 50 years has been in razor blades.The mature generation knows what I am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put--this razor is IT!.&lt;br /&gt;Nuttin else like it.&lt;br /&gt;Best I have ever  used.&lt;br /&gt;That;s all!</li>
    <li> My facial hair grows slowly but I still shave about twice a week to keep my face clean-shaven and at that rate each blade is typically good for about a month or so before I start to notice a slight drag while shaving. Overall I think these set of blades does a good job of their intended purpose.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re razorblades. They shave my face. I kind of wish I didn&#x27;t have to keep buying them, but hey, my job requires me to be clean-shaven, so alas, here we are. I like the Fusion series, even though some complain that they run a little pricey (which they do). I don&#x27;t get any nicks unless I have a zit (not the razor&#x27;s fault). I find myself replacing the blades about every few weeks, and shaving every other day.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years - I really like them.  They are a little bit more but work much better.</li>
    <li> Any man who shaves knows these are the best...</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great cartridges, only give it 4 stars because they&#x27;re outrageously expensive!</li>
    <li> As someone who has used Gillete razors for 15 years, I am very impressed by their latest product. I have a tough beard and sensitive skin, which means I need a good razor. This razor does a great job at providing an extremely close and comfortable shave. I have used this for a few months now and can say they are a good improvement on the Fusion blades. These seem to last just as long and provide a better shave through their entire life. Cuts and nicks have been non-existent since I switched to these blades.</li>
    <li> After all these ad&#x27;s promising smoother softer shave I didnt feel much difference in the shave quality and its certainly not worth the price of over $3 a blade.</li>
    <li> Do yourselves a favor. Check out Harry&#x27;s razors and blades. I was a skeptic myself, but the blades are much better and last twice as long - eight for 15.00.&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette prices are absurd. And you still won&#x27;t get a date with Angelina Jolie.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I don&#x27;t work for Harry&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> My husband loves them  they are really good for Shaving and good price too.</li>
    <li> No problems, just a good standard refil for my Razor refill.  I always forget that it is battery powered and don&#x27;t use that function.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re just razors, but just right for my needs.</li>
    <li> these blades are smooth and i really mean it. gillette has realized that we dont need scraped skin by shaving with a gazillion edges in a razor. its about getting a smooth shave and this does it. also no one can beat amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> So far so good  best razors so far</li>
    <li> Multiple times repeat purchase. Consistent quality, no issues. Will keep buying till Gillette introduces new design. Cheers,</li>
    <li> I tried another brand that was cheaper, but found out they did not last or did they have as good a shave as with Gillette. I am back with gillette and not changing again, Gillette is the all around best for the money!</li>
    <li> Stop using Gillette products. Upgrade to a safety razor. Trust me.</li>
    <li> I had to give 5 stars because I am not sure how one could improve on this item.  It&#x27;s the best out there by far.  Leaves my face \\&quot;baby-butt\\&quot; smooth.  (I have never touched a baby&#x27;s butt, so don&#x27;t quote me on that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the refills are expensive, it&#x27;s worth the premium for that clean shaved look.</li>
    <li> I been a MachIII user for years. But the airline lost my bag and this was on sale so tried it I will never go back. and the price here on Amazon cant be beat.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these blades and this was a better price thanWalmart</li>
    <li> Shaved my face and all. Nice to be able to just order these to my door and not have to think about it again!</li>
    <li> The perfect shave......every day. ..</li>
    <li> I think these must have been old because each head only lasts me MAYBE 2 weeks. It is quite disappointing. They should last longer than that. The brand new one that came with the razor lasted me almost 2 months.</li>
    <li> I have found little difference between the Fusion and the  Proglide version. They are both the best. It beats any DE&lt;br /&gt; blade for smoothness and absence of nicks. The only negative is price. The DEs are waaaaaay cheaper</li>
    <li> Been using them from the time they came out and they are great.&lt;br /&gt;No hassles no nicks no cuts!, just a clean shave</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette Fusion Proglide Power shavers for years and have been happy with it.  I&#x27;ve always gotten a great shave from the product.  My only complaint is the price.  I know the markup on shaving razors is incredible.  But since Amazon doesn&#x27;t have separate criteria rating, I can only rate the product, not the price.  And the product is good.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get many shaves from it. The first shave is wonderful thereafter isn&#x27;t. Cost too much not to get many shaves from one blade.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave at a great price, set up on auto delivery and saved more..</li>
    <li> Best shaver ever. Convenient, handiest, precise blade to use.Ive use it for a week, never been happier. Trie it you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> These are a 6 or 8 pack of Fusion ProGlide Power cartridges (although they actually work fine with the regular Fusion too)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got them, there were 6, they fit on my Fusion ProGlide Power razor. That means they are exactly what they say they are, and do what they say they do. 5-stars.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and painless cut and no irritation at all after shaving. These blades are very sharp and smooth. The Fusion is by far the best I have found.I received this product via a program run by Gillette for free.</li>
    <li> I had a chance to try a set of Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Blades thanks to a program Gillette was offering. These blades do just what I want them to do. They cut right up to the skin nice and smooth without cutting the skin. It grabs ahold of even the small stubs. Ever wanted a smooth face? These blades will be for you because it gets every little piece of hair. If you are using the Pro Glide Styler with this then you can have it vibrate which will make your hair stand up and have it cut even closer and smoother. I have never had another razor cut so close before. I have tried multiple ones. When I moved to the Gillette razors I could see the difference instantly. I have been using Gillette razors for a long time now and that is because of the quality that they produce. You know you will get a good product when you go Gillette. Every since I have been using these new blades I have noticed my face does not break out as bad either. I would recommend these to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love everything about these razors.</li>
    <li> Very smothie shave. each razor could last for amost a month. It is a very good quality, the price its a little expensive tough.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a damn good price for six blades. Very well packaged and arrived on time. This is my second time ordering from this company.</li>
    <li> Had to exchange one package since the blades were old. 2010 packaging. I know if we get original Gillette blades they are of good quality but only thing you have to be vareful is if they are new or old as that can significantly affect your shavings</li>
    <li> That is a very, very sharp knife, that is.</li>
    <li> Though they are expensive, I really do like them. BUT they are super expensive.</li>
    <li> Best deal on the market. Great price and good quality. I recommend everyone to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> These cartridges are of average construction.  The green lubrication strip on the top stays effective for about two weeks and does not completely become useless for another two weeks. It works great for both power and manual Gillette fusion razors. The precision trimmer makes it easy to trim under the nose and sideburns. I received this product for free to try from gillette.</li>
    <li> I have tried many Gillette blades in the past and I can certainly  say that this is in my list of top favorites. I was previously using a different Gillette blade and this blade which I tried for free caused significantly less skin irritation. I also feel that this cartridge has the best single blade on the reverse side for getting sharp lines around facial hair ever.</li>
    <li> The fading green strips help you keep track of when it is time for a blade change.  Nice feature.  Downside, they are still ridiculously expensive.  I am all for a frequent shaver program, Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Matt B.&lt;br /&gt;Chicago</li>
    <li> Good price works great with &#x27;Edge&#x27; Shaving cream. Love the subscription model. Looking forward to checking it out. Thanks. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Got the razor for my elderly dad, who was having trouble shaving cleanly with his old razors. Loose skin etc. This is working really great for him, he&#x27;s able to get a clean shave safely on his own.</li>
    <li> Razors are good quality.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and these blades treat it right. Never a nick and buying the &#x27;real thing&#x27; - not a knock off - they last an incredibly long time</li>
    <li> work great, one of my husbands favorite brands. he prefers the high dollar razors to the cheaper brand, may get 4 shaves out of one refill</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  These are the best blades on the market today and this is the best price.  I have them delivered every other month.</li>
    <li> Everything as expected</li>
    <li> I now joined the Dollar shave club so I wont be ordering anymore. a a a a a a a</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor blades are exactly what they are. They work great and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Was quick &amp; what I waiting for thanks. The price is not the best but is affordable. Was a good service</li>
    <li> A bit expensive, so buy them in multi-packs to help bring the price down. This is the best blade I&#x27;ve used, but it still leaves me unsatisfied. I have to go over my neck area many times to get the best I can, and even then I can feel tiny stubble. That said, it&#x27;s still better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried just about all of them. I don&#x27;t like the green strip which does make the blades glide smoother, but I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s also another layer which moves the blades away from the skin. I think this blade shaves better after the green strip wears down a bit, not leaving that film. Still can&#x27;t decide if it shaves better with or without the power turned on, but I think it does shave &amp;#34;easier&amp;#34; on the neck, just not closer.</li>
    <li> get it at costco, that is the best way to save money</li>
    <li> Gillette makes the best product for the Men’s Shaving Needs; and Amazon always has the Best Price for the Best Product.</li>
    <li> All good except the price.  Could have bought them cheaper at the local Walgreens!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many razor blades since making the switch from an Electric razor, but I can tell you that these are amazing!</li>
    <li> I shave two to three times a week and my first blade lasted over 5 month. That&#x27;s between 50 and 60 shaves per blade. I used to only get three to four shaves with the old Gillette Trac II and they were like ten bucks for a pack of 10 on sale back in the day. Reviewers that are getting only 4 shaves a blade...I can&#x27;t understand that! The blades are expensive but considering the number of shaves you get they come out to be much cheaper. And for anyone that hasn&#x27;t tried the power version of this razor...DO IT!</li>
    <li> Very very sharp! Be very careful shaving your man parts.. ouch.</li>
    <li> Prices arevery high for this product!</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> On time. Great for shaving. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Different then what&#x27;s in the stores these are the worst</li>
    <li> As with most razors, you need to change out the razor.  This refill pack goes with the proglide I purchased so I don&#x27;t have to worry when I need a replacement, I&#x27;ve got them.</li>
    <li> Got the chance to try the flexball with the new gel as well. What a great combination. No nicks and best of all, no ingrown hairs the next couple of days after. It has always been a trade off....close shave and ingrown hairs or stubbly shave and no ingrown hairs....NOT ANYMORE!!!!  Even though I got to try this as part of a promotion, I would buy them in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power blades for a while now that I recieved from a promotion that Gillette was running. I love them. This is the shaver you have been waiting for! The blades are unbelievable! They are sharp and stay sharp through the entire use of the blade. I have a medium thick beard, and it works great. I have to shave every morning. If any of you are out there like me, the razors of the past just didnt hold up well, tugged at your hair, and had to be thrown away after a couple of uses. After a couple months of use with my new proglide fusion power, it is absolutely the best razors money can buy. I can shave every morning now without fear of razor burn, tugs, and cuts. Besides all of that the blades give a me a good shave for a minimum of a month and a half.&lt;br /&gt; I do have one problem with it. It&#x27;s very pricy. I would much rather it have been cheeper, but I would rather spend more money on a product that works than something that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt; In conclusion, the blades are the best out there. Although the blades are expensive, you won&#x27;t be let down. I give this a 5-out-5 stars.  I highly recomend these blades.</li>
    <li> Love these blades for my razor and they leave a clean shave and I would recommend these to anyone who wants to buy them</li>
    <li> Smooth as a babies bottom. I can&#x27;t say enough of how good a shave this gives me. It is expensive, but you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> The blades begin to dull after only about two weeks of daily use, but still may be one of the better replacements on the market</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great razor and it really gave me a very smooth shave.  I cannot remember ever getting such a smooth shave.  On the downside, the packaging SUCKS!  There are NO diriections of any sort, I had to send it back because I could not find the on/off switch, That too is not even labled.  no written warranty, any thing that is written on the package you CANNOT READ because of how so many of the companies all have this brainstorm that their choices of color it nice.  WELL IT&#x27;S NOT!!  It is extremely difficult to read pale gray over any color, black over red, blue over orange. gold over brown etc. On top of it all,  the the print is extremely small.  I have 20/20 vision and I need to get out my magnifying glass. If it&#x27;s the cost of the ink, then raise the damn price another penny and make it easier for customers to read.  It&#x27;s not only gillette that does it, its eveything with a label  is done like that.  When after they sent me a replacement (sill no instructions) my friend and I figured out where it was (no name label and not a soft touch) Very hard to turn it on/off   Even what I am typing here, the black is very pale, and letters are dificult to see. For these reasons I did not give a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> great price online than the at the stores, was looking at many stores for a lesser price as i need this everyday.</li>
    <li> Great product. My husband likes these razors.</li>
    <li> I reviewed the Proglide Fusion Power razor, and what I have said there applies here.  I am very underwhelmed by the poor shaving experience.</li>
    <li> These are good blades, and the price I paid was very reasonable compared to the prices at the local stores.</li>
    <li> Great $$. Came very quick. Real Gillette. Not the fake ones. Husband only uses these</li>
    <li> Great set of razor blades. I have trusted my facial hairs to Gillette for all of my shaving years, and each new &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; does make a difference in the smoothness and ability to cut down on razor burn.</li>
    <li> Great blade for excellent razor. Branded, cheaper to find. The larger package to buy, the cheaper. Satisfied with your purchase, may subscribe to a monthly purchase.</li>
    <li> The Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power blades are great.  Their are many to choose from to get any and all hair that is unwanted.  They really do get everywhere!</li>
