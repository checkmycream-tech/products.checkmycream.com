<li> Exactly what we needed for practicing before we get serious about tattooing.</li>

<li> Needles are different sizes than the tubes sucks what am I supposed to do with that waste of money</li>
<li> Needles and tubes were everything I expected!!!</li>
<li> order from these guys a few times.</li>

<li> WAS A FUCK IN RECALL FOR MY ODER...</li>
<li> they just guessed and guessed wrong.</li>
<li> They were useless to me.</li>
<li> and i was wrong</li>
<li> i didnt need at the time and nothing matched any of the needles... horrible when i get tips that are 14rs and needels that were 3rl</li>

    <li> they were exactly what i needed.</li>
    <li> awesome. order from these guys a few times.</li>
    <li> they were all the same size and they were suppose to be different sizes and i only got 50 instead of 60</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;[t get a tattoo without these.  There was a lot of them for a great price and it shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Product is as described and a great price. Great product top of the line.  I would reccomend this item to others. Product is as described.</li>
    <li> Everything Arrived as advertised. All needles and tubes were packaged correctly. Everything was speedy and accurate so I&#x27;m happy. Everything was assorted and while I&#x27;m not totally sure that all the needles match the tubes, I&#x27;m confident they do.</li>
    <li> didnt have variety i was looking for</li>
    <li> they ship it out fast estsmsted date for me to get it was feb 4th i ordered it jan 10 i got it today what is jan 13 tverything matches up i would buy again and i would tell all my friends it was a great buy and had a tube for each needle</li>
    <li> This is a great deal with the ability to pick what you want.  I use a limited variety of needles in my work and don&#x27;t like to pay for a bunch of stuff I don&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> I was sent tubes that didn&#x27;t have needles to match. I wouldn&#x27;t order them again! They were useless to me.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t match. I have needles with no tubes and tubes with no needles. Seller will not respond to the problem. Just threw stuff in the box and got their money.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, tubes are perfect no packages ripped and no damage. Properly sterilized. Needles are great and properly sterilize aswell, going to purchase some more very soon. Over all its a 10 out of 10. Good deal.</li>
    <li> The ONLY good thing about this order, was that it was earlier than than the expected date.&lt;br /&gt;I have almost 1/3 of the tubes that I will NOT use because I have nothing to match them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 6 different needles, and ten count each, and the tubes for those needles, I only have about 4 of each. plus a bunch extra that luckily enough I will use, and already have needles for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item to someone who is just starting out and hoping to get matching tubes and needles, it won&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;If you have existing needles already, you MIGHT find one or two to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around I am very displeased with this order, and I will not be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these especially with the disposable tubes!</li>
    <li> Not all that good I got confused on some of the grips I got a lot of mags that I dont use</li>
    <li> WAS A FUCK IN RECALL FOR MY ODER...SENT IT BANK 2 WEEKS A GO AND STILL NO FUCK IN REFUND!! AMAZING SUX COCK!</li>
    <li> i bought this item and i assume that the tubes had matching needles and i was wrong this product is worth s***</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I needed/was looking for. And when the package didn&#x27;t make it to me the first time around, they were very prompt and helpful in sending another set, which I recieved within days!  :)</li>
    <li> These are great for the price! They work very well. They are all packaged. Customers love seeing you open the needle from a new packaged than using a &#x27;sterilized&#x27; needle. These work great. Shipped fast. No issues.</li>
    <li> No needles in the pack, just grips. Now I cant get intouch with anyone for my money back</li>
    <li> I was under the assumption that needles came in same packages as the tubes and grips came in. Evidently i was wrong cause everything was just tossed into box and was not the sizes i ordered. Seller never contacted me to insure what sizes i wanted if they were out they just guessed and guessed wrong.</li>
    <li> Needles and tubes were everything I expected!!! Great value!!!!</li>
    <li> decent for the price.</li>
    <li> everything was accounted for and the needles seem good. the only problem is that some of the tubes at the tips are bent and/or chipped. fast delivery and no ripped packages. just disappointed about the tubes, but the deal is good.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected .. But a good product</li>
    <li> Worked well for me, though its a bit quicker when the combined tube, tip, grip and needle are together in the same package, because you don&#x27;t have to shuffle through them all to find the right matching needle. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Only the 7 rs had matching needles and barrels. All the others didn&#x27;t have matches or to many matches. Thank god I had a lot of extra needles from the last batch I ordered. Never again with this company</li>
    <li> Needles are different sizes than the tubes sucks what am I supposed to do with that waste of money do not BUYYYY I repeat DO NOT BUYYY you will regret it</li>
    <li> it said i would be able to choose but it never gave the options and i recieved alot of stuff i didnt need at the time and nothing matched any of the needles... horrible when i get tips that are 14rs and needels that were 3rl i needed to chose but its my mistake for proceding</li>
    <li> As far as the needles go they are fine work well but I wish the tubes would match the needles I have tubes that I don&#x27;t have needles for and needles I don&#x27;t have tubes for and they aren&#x27;t labeled to really know but you get what you pay for I would buy again just because of the quality and how much you pay</li>
    <li> Perfectly designed for what we wanted to start out with. Exactly what we needed for practicing before we get serious about tattooing.</li>
    <li> Great set, very helpful in getting the set up. Definitely recommended</li>
    <li> Thank you. Exactly what the post said I would receive. 😊 trust and satisfaction achieved 😊</li>
    <li> 1 star for price.... had to go through like ten needles before I found one that would hold ink</li>
    <li> Good deal, best value, I&#x27;ll reorder when my supply runs low</li>
