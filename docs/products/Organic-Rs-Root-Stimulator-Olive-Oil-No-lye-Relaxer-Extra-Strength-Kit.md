### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Now l want to state that I am VERY experienced at home relaxers.  </li>
      <li>nothing ever affected my hair, i have a good quality hair, this one, placed it on my hair for 5 min, and that is it!!</li>
      <li>When you find what works best you stick with it.</li>

      <li>I use the Incredibly Moisturizing Hair Lotion in between relaxers, wash my hair with the aloe shampoo, condition with the Replenishing Pak, and my hair has truly benefited as a result.</li>
      <li>Which, in theory, is beautiful in itself.</li>

      <li>know I sound like a spokesperson for the company, but I promise I&#x27;m just a very satisfied customer!</li>

      <li>It feels nice and healthy</li>
      <li>Easy instructions and no burn for me!</li>

      <li>My hair is silky, shiny, and most importantly HEALTHY after every relaxer.</li>
      <li>I am glad I chose this one.</li>
      <li>but glad I didn&#x27;t use it until reading this.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I love the product and its easiness too use.</li>
      <li>Out of curiosity, I decided to try my luck at Africa&#x27;s Best Olive Oil relaxer a couple of years ago to see if I would get similar results to ORS.</li>
      <li>Lovely.</li>
      <li>Please make sure to ask and get a reply before purchasing from the company.  </li>
      <li>I used this product a week ago and love the way my hair feels.</li>
      <li>It left my virgin hair silky smooth and superb!!!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own right.  </li>
      <li>it really makes my hair silky and strong, I recently change from the AVLON relaxers as they were really good on my hair but were burning my scalp and this product just feels better, and is a lot less damaging to my scalp, it really is a good product in case you want to change from the lye relaxers to a no lye relaxer this is the product to have, your hair and your scalp will thank you...! :D</li>
      <li>I had a good bit of new growth</li>
      <li>I would rinse out after 12 min bcuz my hair is too fine for that bone str8 look.)</li>
      <li>Followed instructions and did a strand test which was fine</li>
      <li>After all these years my hair is BONE-STRAIGHT, and still, after relaxing feels super healthy.</li>
      <li>It made my hair nice and straight my hair does not feel damaged at all.</li>
      <li>All my long, beautiful hair - ruined.</li>
      <li>This was my first time self relaxing since I&#x27;ve been on my healthy hair journey</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>I have used various at home relaxer systems over the years and I must say that this one is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>Right before a vacation, too!</li>
      <li>But, to keep it looking good, I have to either wash it daily to keep the spiral curl (which then dries it out) or wash it and spend almost two hours between conditioning and straighening twice a week with touch ups</li>
      <li>so I used a good amount and even left it on for 16 min.</li>
      <li>On top of that i also noticed that i was loosing more hair daily than a animal shedding their fur in the spring time!</li>
      <li>, My hair suffered tremendous breakage and was falling out as well.</li>
      <li>and it leaves my hair feeling soooo soft and healthy looking...</li>
      <li>This product is good for the relaxing of black hair.</li>
      <li>I am mixed, with semi-curly hair, and thankfully I have a ton of hair, otherwise I&#x27;m sure I would have been bald after this.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if my hair is just growing more coarse now</li>
      <li>This was NOT the first time that I had done a home relaxer</li>
      <li>Since so many people swear by it, I will give this product the benefit of the doubt, and say that it is possible that I may have received an expired product.</li>
      <li>for the first time...grown my hair to my shoulder blades.  </li>
      <li>This stuff absolutely WRECKED my hair!</li>
      <li>it made my hair 100% long and healthy</li>
      <li>She never even tried to fix in when I went back to her because pieces of the perm was falling out and becoming sort of straight.</li>
      <li>i was in high school and wearing big wide ponytails not that attractive</li>
      <li>I applied relaxer as directed and left it on 12 minutes (I have fine hair</li>
      <li>As a result I had very high hopes.</li>
      <li>really is my fault</li>
      <li>this relaxer gets my hair just as straight as affirm if not straighter</li>
      <li>but this relaxer really didn&#x27;t take at all</li>
      <li>I cant really say as I don&#x27;t know how it may affect them.</li>
      <li>and I would just rather go on a search hunt for Gentle Treatment Relaxer instead.</li>
      <li>still the demarcation was still very visible.</li>
      <li>My hair didn&#x27;t shed as much as I anticipated but this relaxer didn&#x27;t take at all.</li>
      <li>My hair feels much softer and healthier after each use.  </li>
      <li>There was a pretty African American girl working in the aisle with very smooth and shiny hair.</li>
      <li>They said to send it back and if the normal was available they would ship it once they talked to the shipping dept.</li>
      <li>It relaxed my hair all right, but left it dry, brittle, and my hair was breaking more.</li>
      <li>but I had no choice as they were out of the Gentle Treatment relaxer, which is the product I normally use.  </li>
      <li>Tonight I used this for the time on the box, and more than half my hair fell out.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s 2b, I don&#x27;t want to add an extra strength relaxer on top and potentially lose the curls I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and i am highly considering filing a claim against the company.</li>
      <li>i used normal not extras strength.</li>
      <li>My hair normally is 3b, after relaxing</li>
      <li>I finally I tried another deep protein conditioner Mega Tek-- $29 on Amazon, and with NExxus Headdress (leave in), Argan oil and a hot flat iron, was able to get my hair to bouncy and shiny again.</li>
      <li>I have finally found the right perm for my hair.</li>
      <li>The instructions that are included are very clear and straight-forward.</li>
      <li>The picture clearly shows the normal strength.</li>
      <li>My hair was already at the bottom of my neck, touching my upper back and after using this it went back to just reaching my nape.  </li>
      <li>The picture clearly shows the normal strength box.</li>
      <li>I usually do not use this product</li>
      <li>For a natural sistah this was amazing since I&#x27;d try to blow dry and flat iron over the years only to have my hair poof out within an hour!</li>
      <li>Apparently the people who give these bad reviews did not follow the instructions correctly or they would have had great results!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Dark &amp; lovely which left me with bald spots...</li>
      <li>but a lot of it) and after using the neutralizing shampoo (amazing for softening and conditioning) and the ORS deep conditioner in the kit (pure garbage)-- the results on my hair were not good.</li>
      <li>and I have ALWAYS had positive experiences doing them not only on myself</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t stinky and I was surprised that one box almost covered all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>husband stated that my hair is soft and my mom didn&#x27;t even notice that it was relaxed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i have very thick hair about shoulder length and i&#x27;ve used relaxers such as mizani-ok, precise-pretty good, bantu-pretty good, and affirm-very good...this relaxer gets my hair just as straight as affirm if not straighter and it leaves my hair feeling soooo soft and healthy looking...i&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
    <li> Like I said in my other review, I swear by the Organic Root Stimulator (ORS) products. I have been using the Extra Strength relaxer for the past 3 years or so because I have thick, coarse hair and it works like a charm. My hair is silky, shiny, and most importantly HEALTHY after every relaxer. No other relaxer I have used has come near to giving me the same results. Out of curiosity, I decided to try my luck at Africa&#x27;s Best Olive Oil relaxer a couple of years ago to see if I would get similar results to ORS. It relaxed my hair all right, but left it dry, brittle, and my hair was breaking more. I immediately switched back to ORS and have not looked back since!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I sound like a spokesperson for the company, but I promise I&#x27;m just a very satisfied customer! I use the Incredibly Moisturizing Hair Lotion in between relaxers, wash my hair with the aloe shampoo, condition with the Replenishing Pak, and my hair has truly benefited as a result. It&#x27;s the healthiest and longest it has ever been in my entire life. Bottom line: Use ORS! You won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use it, biiiiig no. nothing ever affected my hair, i have a good quality hair, this one, placed it on my hair for 5 min, and that is it!! looks bad, feels bad, dry, lost its shine.... trust me on this, you don&#x27;t want to use this horrible thing on your hair:@</li>
    <li> I would love to say that this product worked wonders for me, but sadly, it did not. I followed all of the directions, but the product did nothing for me. I mean nothing. Since so many people swear by it, I will give this product the benefit of the doubt, and say that it is possible that I may have received an expired product.</li>
    <li> The picture clearly shows the normal strength. What I recieved was the extra strength. I called to find out why and they said it doesn&#x27;t state a strength on the web page? The picture clearly shows the normal strength box.They said to send it back and if the normal was available they would ship it once they talked to the shipping dept. I have decided to keep it and not deal with the hassle. Hope my hair will be okay.</li>
    <li> I have used various at home relaxer systems over the years and I must say that this one is by far the best.  My hair feels much softer and healthier after each use.  One thing I don&#x27;t like is the build up left by the conditioner contained in this system.  My solution:  I leave it in for a while (plastic cap for an hour or so and even overnight) but I then do a complete shampoo after rather than just a rinse.  My practice is also to always get a professional trim after each relaxer.</li>
    <li> I suspect the person who rated this product 1 star didn&#x27;t follow the instructions.     This product was my first venture into the world of hair-relaxers, and it turned out much simpler and less caustic than I had anticipated. The instructions that are included are very clear and straight-forward. If you apply the same precaution and common sense as you would in, say, high school chem lab (e.g. use gloves, don&#x27;t do it near an open flame), I guarantee you&#x27;ll be fine. Putting Vaseline on your hairline really helps, and have a wet towel on hand so you can wipe any stray globs that land on your face/forehead before they burn you.     I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the results. This isn&#x27;t just for african-american hair. I have curly/wavy and course hair, and when I used to straighten it with an iron, it would always curl up again after I showered. Now it stays relatively straight even after it gets wet. Not only that, it&#x27;s even shinier now.</li>
    <li> Just what I respected. great purchase for the price, I would recommend to buy this item..I would buy it again..</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this relaxer!! I&#x27;ve just started relaxing my hair after almost 2 years. I&#x27;ve tried Dark &amp; lovely which left me with bald spots... fabulaxer was ok but left my hair a little dry...I&#x27;ve even tried kiddie relaxers( just for me) which left my hair stiff and shedding.  My sister started using this relaxer a month ago and it made her hair look healthy and beautiful so she recommended I give it a try. It left my virgin hair silky smooth and superb!!!! I will be using this for years to come. Wish I had tried it long ago.</li>
    <li> I went natural 8 years ago because solely because I wanted to look different among the crowd. After struggling with my natural 4C hair for so long, I decided to get a relaxer so I could get a sew in. This product is AMAZING! After all these years my hair is BONE-STRAIGHT, and still, after relaxing feels super healthy. I only used one extra strength kit for my thick hair that goes to the middle of my back. I can&#x27;t believe the amazing results and am so happy it came with the conditioner! I left it on for around 2 hours and followed with wrapping my hair. For a natural sistah this was amazing since I&#x27;d try to blow dry and flat iron over the years only to have my hair poof out within an hour! Easy instructions and no burn for me!</li>
    <li> This stuff absolutely WRECKED my hair! No matter how much I wash it, it leaves a weird chalky feel to my hair. My hair is so disgustingly stiff - like it still has product in it even though its rinsed out. All my long, beautiful hair - ruined. Right before a vacation, too! Lovely.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before deciding on this relaxer. As a result I had very high hopes. This relaxer was on sale ($3.99) at my local BSS which is another reason why I purchased it. This was my first time self relaxing since I&#x27;ve been on my healthy hair journey and I wanted to be careful not to suffer a setback. My hair didn&#x27;t shed as much as I anticipated but this relaxer didn&#x27;t take at all. I have very fine 4b hair and hadn&#x27;t relaxed in 3 months. I had a good bit of new growth so I used a good amount and even left it on for 16 min. (Whenever I self relaxed before my journey I would rinse out after 12 min bcuz my hair is too fine for that bone str8 look.) I don&#x27;t know if my hair is just growing more coarse now and I needed to leave it on longer or what but this relaxer really didn&#x27;t take at all which is something I&#x27;ve never experienced in over 20 years of relaxing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been relaxing my hair for 16 years...and believe me I&#x27;ve tried everything from Revlon&#x27;s Fabulaxer to Hawaiian Silky to Botanicals Something-or-other...  Believe me when I say that this is the only one that works!!!  And works well!!I have African American hair that is not super coarse but can be resistant in it&#x27;s own right.  It is also extremely fragile.  In the past, I&#x27;ve used relaxers that have dried out my hair and made it extremely frizzy and some were so strong that they nearly balded my edges...Olive Oil was gentle helped them grow back.  My hair is stronger now than ever and have...for the first time...grown my hair to my shoulder blades.  This product and rollersets using Olive Oil Wrap and Set Mousse are the secret to healthy hair...at least the secret to my healthy hair.I recommend this product if your hair is currently unhealthy and you need a change and would like to see real growth.  I also recommend this product if you are tired of spending too much time, energy and money on maintaining your healthy hair at the salon...or if your currently relaxer just isn&#x27;t straightening the way it used to.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I tried this product. After reading negative reviews I still thought that can&#x27;t happen to me, my hair has never had issues being bleached or dyed black or purple or whatever I pleased that month. Tonight I used this for the time on the box, and more than half my hair fell out. I&#x27;ve been crying all night about this, I&#x27;ve had hair relaxers in the years past and never had an issue. I&#x27;d be better off with a wig at this point.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year with good results but in December I used a kit and whoa, terrible results. I applied relaxer as directed and left it on 12 minutes (I have fine hair but a lot of it) and after using the neutralizing shampoo (amazing for softening and conditioning) and the ORS deep conditioner in the kit (pure garbage)-- the results on my hair were not good. There was a clear line of demarcation between previous relaxed hair (using ORS) and this new touch-up that did not come out straight, or even wave. This NL relaxer just made my hair extremely rough looking, dull and lifeless. Seems like a change in formula, ORS, not a smart move-- at all.  It has taken me 2 months of weekly rounds of deep conditioning with Nexxus Emergencee, Rolland Rebuild therapy (great for moisturizing) still the demarcation was still very visible. I finally I tried another deep protein conditioner Mega Tek-- $29 on Amazon, and with NExxus Headdress (leave in), Argan oil and a hot flat iron, was able to get my hair to bouncy and shiny again. No more bun to hide the ORS damage. I don&#x27;t think I will use ORS NoLye relaxer again.</li>
    <li> One of my family members told my mom about this relaxer to try it out on my head i been natural all my life and was scared to death to try it out on my hair is everything to me i was in high school and wearing big wide ponytails not that attractive sometimes so that day i tried it i was happy with how it felt on my hair it was so soft and smell so good it made my hair 100% long and healthy was happy to see it since then i been relaxing my hair it works out good and it grows my hair but the downside is to this relaxer is that it thin my hair which it was like before my hair was not thin but it not bad thin but other then that i am happy with the change it made me happy i used normal not extras strength.</li>
    <li> This is the only straightening kit my daughter uses on her hair.  I&#x27;ve tried to get her to use others but she keeps coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> This product is good for the relaxing of black hair. My daughter and I love the product and its easiness too use.</li>
    <li> Well I bought this product &amp; after opening it &amp; reading instructions I find out you cannot use it on bleached or permanently colored hair. I looked on the package but didn&#x27;t see any info like this on the box. Disappointed  but glad I didn&#x27;t use it until reading this. I don&#x27;t my hair to break off.</li>
    <li> I have finally found the right perm for my hair. When you find what works best you stick with it. This is the best for me personally.</li>
    <li> I love this relaxer it really makes my hair silky and strong, I recently change from the AVLON relaxers as they were really good on my hair but were burning my scalp and this product just feels better, and is a lot less damaging to my scalp, it really is a good product in case you want to change from the lye relaxers to a no lye relaxer this is the product to have, your hair and your scalp will thank you...! :D</li>
    <li> My hair has been extremely dry since moving to Vegas. I used this product a week ago and love the way my hair feels. Without a doubt the best at home product on the market!!</li>
    <li> If I could give no stars I would, do not recommend at all. Followed instructions and did a strand test which was fine but after the treatment half of my hair has fallen out and whats left is ruined. Will need to go ti get 6 inches off tomorrow to remove the damage.  Horrendous experience</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a latina who has thick spiral curly hair to the middle of my back. Which, in theory, is beautiful in itself. But, to keep it looking good, I have to either wash it daily to keep the spiral curl (which then dries it out) or wash it and spend almost two hours between conditioning and straighening twice a week with touch ups every day(which eventually dries it out to). Who has that kind of time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A relaxer at the salon was going to run me upwards of $200! Yeah right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at the CVS and went into the relaxers section. There was a pretty African American girl working in the aisle with very smooth and shiny hair. I had already grabbed this box and asked her if she knew which one was the best one. She commented that she only uses the one I had in my hands, so I thanked her and grabbed another box(um, I have LOTS of hair....).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was REALLY thankful that this DOES NOT HAVE A BAD SMELL! Finally, a product that does what it says! It wasn&#x27;t stinky and I was surprised that one box almost covered all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband stated that my hair is soft and my mom didn&#x27;t even notice that it was relaxed. She said it looks like it always does when I spend 90 minutes on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How great to find a product that works FAST and doesn&#x27;t smell. And now it only takes me less than 20 minutes to make my hair look salon perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving me my time back: priceless!</li>
    <li> This product is a godsend. I hope the formula never changes like other products (not just relaxers) have changed in the past. I like that it leaves a little texture to my hair and doesnt completely straighten it limp. Keeps my tresses thick and with body.</li>
    <li> I had read that I could use this product on my extra curly hair to get it to straighten. But I found out it just dried it out very much. It straightened it for about 2 weeks but it was so dry it felt like hay. DO NOT USE IT IF YOU ARE WHITE NO MATTER WHAT IT SAYS.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this item, I noticed that the packaging said &amp;#34;regular strength&amp;#34; but when it was added to my cart it showed up as &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34;.  I did ask the sellers which they would be sending.  I never heard back from them and so I thought, well there is a chance it could be my type, but when I received it, it was &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34;.  My hair was relaxed about a year ago, with the same brand in regular strength, and so I am afraid to use it on my hair.  My hair normally is 3b, after relaxing it&#x27;s 2b, I don&#x27;t want to add an extra strength relaxer on top and potentially lose the curls I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is my fault and I do love this product.  I just don&#x27;t use this strength.  Please make sure to ask and get a reply before purchasing from the company.  Otherwise you will be in the same situation as me.</li>
    <li> 3 months ago I had a horrible spiral perm experience! I  didn&#x27;t want layers in my hair and the hairdresser gave me layers.. Choppy and uneven! Anyways the perm was horrible. She never even tried to fix in when I went back to her because pieces of the perm was falling out and becoming sort of straight. I am part Indian, White and Mexican. After three months of battling the horrible excuse for a perm. I  decided to try to get my hair back to the way it was by using a hair relaxer. I am glad I chose this one. I bought it at Walmart  for 7 dollars. If you FOLLOW the instructions then it will work for you! It made my hair nice and straight my hair does not feel damaged at all. It feels nice and healthy BECAUSE I followed the instructions. Apparently the people who give these bad reviews did not follow the instructions correctly or they would have had great results! I would give this 100 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I had hair about 3 inches below my shoulders before using this product, and now I have hair up to my chin!!! It killed my ends soooo bad, and made so much of my hair fall out, I was horrified! I am mixed, with semi-curly hair, and thankfully I have a ton of hair, otherwise I&#x27;m sure I would have been bald after this. What hair I do have left is straighter, but I would never do this again just for slightly curly hair!!!!</li>
    <li> I usually do not use this product but I had no choice as they were out of the Gentle Treatment relaxer, which is the product I normally use.  Me being lazy, and not wanting to go on a search to various BS stores, I went ahead and purchased the ORS relaxer.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t though.  I had a terrible experience with this product.  Now l want to state that I am VERY experienced at home relaxers.  This was NOT the first time that I had done a home relaxer and I have ALWAYS had positive experiences doing them not only on myself but others as well.  Anyway, I followed the directions to a T and at the end, My hair suffered tremendous breakage and was falling out as well. I am in the process of growing my hair out.  My hair was already at the bottom of my neck, touching my upper back and after using this it went back to just reaching my nape.  I would never use this product ever again and I would just rather go on a search hunt for Gentle Treatment Relaxer instead. Would I recommend it to anyone else? I cant really say as I don&#x27;t know how it may affect them.But I would say try at your own risk.</li>
    <li> be careful with you edged.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this relaxer for a while now and couldn understand why i was experiencing a terribly dry itchy scalp. On top of that i also noticed that i was loosing more hair daily than a animal shedding their fur in the spring time! This experience has been traumatic and life altering and i am highly considering filing a claim against the company. If anyone has suffered from a bad experience such as me, please contact me personally via email at Neyshera@yahoo.com</li>
