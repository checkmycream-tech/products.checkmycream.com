    <li> Ordered this product and I received only 1 tube!!!</li>
    <li> Seems t work for my daughter ..... see asked for more.</li>
    <li> seems like a good product</li>
    <li> I would recommend Green Tea Moisturizer to anyone who has combination dry/oily skin. It seems to have healing properties after I apply it.  I really love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great weekly mask to keep breakouts in check! But I especially like it as an overnight sudden breakout buster!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this product for any breakout of skin problem.  It&#x27;s wonderful and we are never without it.  This is an exceptionally good buy and with prime, no shipping, and two day delivery.  How did I ever live without amazon.com???</li>
    <li> It was as advertised, nothing sneaky.  Arrived quickly, with sealed foil tabs on tubes and doesn&#x27;t expire until 2016.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent results overnight.</li>
    <li> My skin used to break out whenever I worked out, no matter how clean my son was. Now I use this mask after my work outs, while the pores are still open, and am amazed to say, my skin is actually under control. Great when I&#x27;m having a hormonal break out too.</li>
    <li> Was elated to see it sold here ordered it right away and received in about a week.Terrific product.  The product works well.  I&#x27;ve suffered from adult acne.  Never had acne as a teen.  I try to use once a week as spot treatment or a light mask.  if I use more than twice a week it dries my combination skin.  I&#x27;ve used this product in 2004-2007 saw tremendous improvement in clearing acne, not sure why I stopped ordering.  Good trivial pursuit:  The sulfur ingredient is found in dead sea products which is known to work wonders for the skin as early as cleo patra accounts are recorded.  Resumed use of this product in 2014.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I wanted, and was exactly what was described.  It works!</li>
    <li> Great mask for getting rid of acne. I suffer from cystic acne and I dab a little on at night and the pimple is much smaller if not gone in the morning.</li>
    <li> Love the look of my skin, so soft</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the seller! The seller is awesome! I received my package at a timely manner. Highly recommend this seller! The Proactive products are great but they work only if you are using their products continuously. This refining mask is good for those pimples that simply won&#x27;t go away. No the pimples don&#x27;t simply vanish before your eyes when using this product but they cause them to shrink and eventually disappear after a few days. If you are prone for breakouts then this is the product for you! I gave this product a 3 because of it&#x27;s usage.</li>
    <li> Great product! Arrived as described.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised!  Proactiv products are consistently very good.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price</li>
    <li> I only got 1 but I am satisfied with the size</li>
    <li> Best spot treatment ever. This stuff will draw out some serious puss and gunk.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have any luck with any other products in the Proactiv line, but this one is a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;My go-to nighttime spot treatment.</li>
