### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is an excellent tooth paste.</li>
      <li>Biotene toothpaste used to be wonderful.</li>
      <li>Best on the market.  </li>
      <li>It works great for me</li>
      <li>Their products are great also.</li>
      <li>The mint gel leaves a pleasant taste in my mouth too.</li>
      <li>Why did they have to change a good thing for this???</li>
      <li>this gentle mint is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>After trying many sensitive toothpastes, this works perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Really nice taste and not too strong.</li>
      <li>The taste is okay.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It is a shame that so many have to suffer for the sins of a company.</li>
      <li>excellent oral product, especially if you take medication.</li>
      <li>and I love the taste.</li>
      <li>It has more of a minty flavor yet still doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth.</li>
      <li>But my mouth feels better.</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste as it doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth.</li>
      <li>I have used the gel toothpaste for many years.</li>
      <li>IF YOU LOVED THE OLD FORMULATION!!!!</li>
      <li>The Gentle Mint Gel kind has been my favorite for years.  </li>
      <li>Ordering online is easy way to keep it on hand.</li>
      <li>Like many others who complain, this feels more like a detergent sometimes than a toothpaste as it suds so much.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a sensitive mouth; I&#x27;ve just been using biotene toothpaste for many years because I liked the way it tasted.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the original formula for over a decade, it did not need to be changed.  </li>
      <li>I have just ordered something which purports to be the original formula.  </li>
      <li>This is a great  product for dry mouth problems i like the mint as it is not sticky and gets into cracks and crevices.</li>
      <li>Great for those with dry mouth.</li>
      <li>Great for dry mouth relief</li>
      <li>This makes no sense, but it is true.  </li>
      <li>The flavor is overwhelming, it burns while brushing, and you cannot get rid of the taste no matter how much you rinse after brushing.</li>
      <li>It worked perfectly and, although it was rather pricey, it was the only toothpaste that didn&#x27;t aggravate the symptoms and actually cooled the fire inside my mouth.  </li>
      <li>I was lucky as the toothpaste itself wasn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
      <li>If they bring back the old formula, I will happily buy it in bulk.</li>
      <li>There are two flavors, Original and Gentle Mint Gel.  </li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine Clean and Gentle Care, Peppermint with Fluoride:&lt;br</li>
      <li>Do not buy biotene products and maybe the company will eventually get the message and go back to the tried and true products that helped so many people.  </li>
      <li>I have a dry mouth and love the light mintyness</li>
      <li>It arrived as expected and is perfect for my dry mouth.</li>
      <li>also hope they fire the person/people who made this decision, because a company that has this kind of contempt for their customers can&#x27;t do well in the long run.  </li>
      <li>Again, I don&#x27;t have a sensitive mouth; I just like the original version&#x27;s taste and that my mouth felt clean afterward with no weird lingering taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Like it very much .</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure saving money and bilking the public is part of it.  </li>
      <li>hope they quickly get back to their original version.  </li>
      <li>Good product but only last a couple hours.</li>
      <li>Best tooth paste for someone who has a dry mouth, or is sensitive to other tooth paste.</li>
      <li>Now it is completely different, it tastes more salty and medicinal, whereas the original Gentle Mint Gel has a nice subtle impression.  </li>
      <li>Some companies never learn that if it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fix it (and make it worse!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I recently discovered that \\&quot;Biotene PBF Plaque Loosening Toothpaste\\&quot; feels more similar to the original formula, and Glaxo hasn&#x27;t mangled that one quite as much, yet.  </li>
      <li>Toms Maine Gentle Peppermint Fluoride]]&lt;br</li>
      <li>They both say \\&quot;gentle mint\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>heard they may be bringing back the original formula which I would recommend, but not the &#x27;improved&#x27; sucralose tasting one.</li>
      <li>The new Biotene foams like Crest or Colgate, leaves the mouth burning like Crest or Colgate or any other soapy, surficant laden toothpaste, and most telling of all</li>
      <li>I guess the new pH formula wasn&#x27;t much of an improvement for me.  </li>
      <li>Now, with the new pH formula, not only is my mouth burning more intensely, my tongue is covered with a white film that looks like oral thrush.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2-3 years and keep an eye out for it on Amazon, which periodically has a decent (for biotene) price for it.</li>
      <li>I am not sure that the toothpaste helps dry mouth, but it does a great job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
      <li>The gel toothpaste was the only thing on the market like it, PLEASE BRING BACK ORIGINAL GEL FORMULA!</li>
      <li>For someone like me who has trouble producing saliva, this is an okay choice.</li>
      <li>DO NOT BUY THE NEW BIOTENE</li>
      <li>The new formulation has given me canker sores because there is an agent in the toothpaste that makes it foam.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update 2: Now Biotene PBF also switched over to the new ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I am glad to see other reviewers feel the same way about the changes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got my old and new tootpaste tubes in hand.  </li>
      <li>We bought this in hope that this was the old Biotene with a new name.</li>
      <li>The  new Biotene lacks the enzymes and the results of the old one, why they changed</li>
      <li>It also feels my mouth feeling dry after brushing, just like normal toothpaste, and it no longer has that low key but refreshing flavor.  </li>
      <li>Recently, they have discontinued it and replaced it with this new &#x27;Gentle Mint&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>I have lupus and frequently get sores in my mouth and throat</li>
      <li>I have stopped using Biotene and would not recommend it to anyone with a sensitive mouth.  </li>
      <li>The toothpaste moderately moisturizes the mouth but not as much as the rinse.</li>
      <li>This is now no different than the other cheap garbage lining the shelves.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste in conjunction with the regular Biotene rinse.</li>
      <li>The old one is 4.5 oz, the new one is 4.3 oz with a fat cap that makes the tube look bigger.  </li>
      <li>The old tube says \\&quot;protein-enzyme system\\&quot;, the new tube says \\&quot;essential fluoride tooth</li>
      <li>Recently Biotene updated the formula to this new \\&quot;improved</li>
      <li>Under a cheaper production with new company &amp;  now has some new rather unhealthy sweeteners  &amp; soapy  foaming agents instead of the original &amp; now has no bio active enzymes which were the  product&#x27;s claim to fame in the first place.</li>
      <li>(The same gremlin puts brands I like on supermarket shelves either next to the floor or too high to reach.)  </li>
      <li>But I found a 3rd party seller on Amazon with some inventory of the old Biotene with an expiration date 2 years from now.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Biotene for those who have dry mouth.</li>
      <li>I have a condition that causes dry mouth, and Biotene is the only thing that has really helped me.</li>
      <li>In the mean time, I&#x27;ll by trying out these SLS free fluoride toothpastes:&lt;br /&gt;Burt</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a thin jelly that seems to disappear in your mouth when you use it, so you have to put more of it on your toothbrush than regular toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I use that also so that my mouth is not dry and therefore lessen the chance of cavaties</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just an average tasting toothpaste with lots of foam.&lt;br /&gt;It went straight in the trash.</li>
      <li>, the new Biotene does not help with dry mouth, cracked lips, or any of the other things the old Biotene did perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My family uses the old Biotene for the taste and low foam (only one person in the family has dry mouth).</li>
      <li>I bought the new toothpaste only to discover that the tube is smaller, the enzyme system is no longer being used, and Xylitol was removed being replaced by a cheap fake sweetener.</li>
      <li>The new formula change gives the toothpaste a burning feeling just like other toothpastes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an excellent tooth paste.</li>
    <li> It arrived as expected and is perfect for my dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Like it very much . Have used it for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> Contains no sodium lauryl sulfate to dry out mouth tissue, like regular toothpaste. This is my reason for staying with Biotene.</li>
    <li> I have used the mint gel Biotene toothpaste for dry mouth for years. Recently, they have discontinued it and replaced it with this new &#x27;Gentle Mint&#x27;.  It tastes terrible, has a strong chemical smell. I&#x27;ll not buy another tube of this junk. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I use that also so that my mouth is not dry and therefore lessen the chance of cavaties</li>
    <li> The new version is horrible. Does not help my dry mouth at all.</li>
    <li> Used for years.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> Helpful for hubby&#x27;s dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. Due to sensitivity to pepper mint this gentle mint is perfect for me. Also I have dry mouth, which it helps....however packaging leaves a lot to be desired. It was shipped in a Priority mail package and was severely crushed upon arrival. I&#x27;d rather they took a little longer and put it in a box. I was lucky as the toothpaste itself wasn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
    <li> There are two flavors, Original and Gentle Mint Gel.  The Gentle Mint Gel kind has been my favorite for years.  Recently Biotene updated the formula to this new \\&quot;improved pH balance.\\&quot;  Now it is completely different, it tastes more salty and medicinal, whereas the original Gentle Mint Gel has a nice subtle impression.  Some companies never learn that if it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fix it (and make it worse!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I recently discovered that \\&quot;Biotene PBF Plaque Loosening Toothpaste\\&quot; feels more similar to the original formula, and Glaxo hasn&#x27;t mangled that one quite as much, yet.  So I recommend Biotene PBF instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: Now Biotene PBF also switched over to the new ingredients.  But I found a 3rd party seller on Amazon with some inventory of the old Biotene with an expiration date 2 years from now.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I can use due to allergy to sulfate.  Really nice taste and not too strong.</li>
    <li> Been using Biotene products for over 10 years and will now stop.  The new formula change gives the toothpaste a burning feeling just like other toothpastes.  It also feels my mouth feeling dry after brushing, just like normal toothpaste, and it no longer has that low key but refreshing flavor.  It has a funky aftertaste now.  The Biotene mouthwash has also been ruined!  So disappointed.  I am glad to see other reviewers feel the same way about the changes. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product now unless they go back to the old formula.</li>
    <li> This is a great  product for dry mouth problems i like the mint as it is not sticky and gets into cracks and crevices.Their products are great also. Best on the market.  None of the others even come close.</li>
    <li> Biotene toothpaste used to be wonderful. I have dry mouth due to a medical condition and this was the only toothpaste that gave me some relief. I bought the new toothpaste only to discover that the tube is smaller, the enzyme system is no longer being used, and Xylitol was removed being replaced by a cheap fake sweetener. Yet the price is still the same! This is now no different than the other cheap garbage lining the shelves. The new formulation has given me canker sores because there is an agent in the toothpaste that makes it foam. I had to discontinue use immediately. Now after years of loyalty to this brand I am forced to find a new toothpaste. DO NOT BUY THE NEW BIOTENE IF YOU LOVED THE OLD FORMULATION!!!!</li>
    <li> There is a terrible after-taste thanks to the new artificial sweeteners that have been added. Why did they have to change a good thing for this??? They did the same with their mouth wash. I do not like artificial sweeteners, but the one they had used before didn&#x27;t leave any after-taste. If it ain&#x27;t broke, why make it worse?!?</li>
    <li> Great for those with dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I have used Colgate all my life but I noticed that it really dried my mouth at nigh before going to bed. My dentist recommend trying Biotene. It works great for me and I love the taste. The only thing is that it is about three times more expensive than a regular toothpaste so I use it only at night. Amazon&#x27;s price is about half of the price at my local store.</li>
    <li> Every other toothpaste, mainstream or alternative, burns my mouth. Biotene is the only one I can use. They have changed the formula somewhat, and I think it&#x27;s an improvement. It has more of a minty flavor yet still doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth.</li>
    <li> Our dental hygienist suggested this. It is expensive. Could be just another gimmick. But my mouth feels better.</li>
    <li> I am not sure that the toothpaste helps dry mouth, but it does a great job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> excellent oral product, especially if you take medication.</li>
    <li> Gentle mint Biotene has become hard to find in stores.  Ordering online is easy way to keep it on hand.</li>
    <li> My family uses the old Biotene for the taste and low foam (only one person in the family has dry mouth). We bought this in hope that this was the old Biotene with a new name. WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;This flavor not gentle. It&#x27;s just an average tasting toothpaste with lots of foam.&lt;br /&gt;It went straight in the trash.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is outrageously overpriced, but it&#x27;s the only one that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums. The std 4.5 oz tube lasts me just one month. It&#x27;s a thin jelly that seems to disappear in your mouth when you use it, so you have to put more of it on your toothbrush than regular toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2-3 years and keep an eye out for it on Amazon, which periodically has a decent (for biotene) price for it.</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I was dealing with Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS).  My dental hygienist recommended it to avoid sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).  Although I eventually discovered my BMS was caused by an adverse reaction to sucralose, and this product contains a small amount of sucralose, I continue to use it because it leaves my mouth feeling refreshed without the bite of a heavy minted toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Good product but only last a couple hours.</li>
    <li> The tube itself wasn&#x27;t sealed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the original formula for over a decade, it did not need to be changed.  The  new Biotene lacks the enzymes and the results of the old one, why they changed it is a mystery but I&#x27;m sure saving money and bilking the public is part of it.  The new Biotene foams like Crest or Colgate, leaves the mouth burning like Crest or Colgate or any other soapy, surficant laden toothpaste, and most telling of all, the new Biotene does not help with dry mouth, cracked lips, or any of the other things the old Biotene did perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Biotene is a total scam, I hate it.</li>
    <li> Recommend for chemo mouth care.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom. She likes it.</li>
    <li> I prefer the PBF version but I started using this version after the taste changed. Like many others who complain, this feels more like a detergent sometimes than a toothpaste as it suds so much. The taste is okay. For someone like me who has trouble producing saliva, this is an okay choice.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a sensitive mouth; I&#x27;ve just been using biotene toothpaste for many years because I liked the way it tasted.  I don&#x27;t know what this company is thinking, but this is a sneaky trick.  I&#x27;ve got my old and new tootpaste tubes in hand.  They both say \\&quot;gentle mint\\&quot;.  The old one is 4.5 oz, the new one is 4.3 oz with a fat cap that makes the tube look bigger.  The old tube says \\&quot;protein-enzyme system\\&quot;, the new tube says \\&quot;essential fluoride tooth protection\\&quot; (no longer has any mention of enzymes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, 10 minutes after brushing my teeth for the first time with this new formulation (read: \\&quot;completely different product\\&quot;), have this nasty chemical aftertaste and my tongue almost burns.  Again, I don&#x27;t have a sensitive mouth; I just like the original version&#x27;s taste and that my mouth felt clean afterward with no weird lingering taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they quickly get back to their original version.  In the mean time, I&#x27;ll by trying out these SLS free fluoride toothpastes:&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees Multicare Peppermint&lt;br /&gt;  [[ASIN:B003BI2L5A Burts Bees Toothpaste Multicare Peppermint]]&lt;br /&gt;and Tom&#x27;s of Maine Clean and Gentle Care, Peppermint with Fluoride:&lt;br /&gt;  [[ASIN:B004UQ6V9Y Toms Maine Gentle Peppermint Fluoride]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also hope they fire the person/people who made this decision, because a company that has this kind of contempt for their customers can&#x27;t do well in the long run.  I don&#x27;t see how they could think that this change would go unnoticed.</li>
    <li> This was my go-to brand until they changed the formula recently - didn&#x27;t realize the change until the first brush and sucralose taste/aftertaste that lingers horribly through the day reminded me I need to return to store and switch brands.  Would have preferred they marketed this as a separate brand, heard they may be bringing back the original formula which I would recommend, but not the &#x27;improved&#x27; sucralose tasting one.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste moderately moisturizes the mouth but not as much as the rinse. I don&#x27;t see any need for moisturizing toothpaste if one uses the rinse.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive mouth due to GVHD from a bone marrow transplant.  If I every have anything with mint it burns and hurts bad.  After trying many sensitive toothpastes, this works perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Best tooth paste for someone who has a dry mouth, or is sensitive to other tooth paste.</li>
    <li> I have used the gel toothpaste for many years. It&#x27;s been a salvation. Now it&#x27;s gone and &amp;#34;gentle mint&amp;#34; is here. It literally tastes like vomit. My dry mouth does not salivate with that flavor. And is not a real gel, so it&#x27;s more irritating too. I have lupus and frequently get sores in my mouth and throat, the gel was the only thing I could use when my mouth gets bad. The gel toothpaste was the only thing on the market like it, PLEASE BRING BACK ORIGINAL GEL FORMULA!</li>
    <li> I have a condition that causes dry mouth, and Biotene is the only thing that has really helped me. I use it every time I brush and also use the mouthwash. Together, they help keep my mouth moist. By keeping my mouth less dry, they also help me avoid sores and scrapes on my cheeks. I highly recommend Biotene for those who have dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I have used Biotene for five years to help relieve the symptoms of Burning Mouth Syndrome.  It worked perfectly and, although it was rather pricey, it was the only toothpaste that didn&#x27;t aggravate the symptoms and actually cooled the fire inside my mouth.  Now, with the new pH formula, not only is my mouth burning more intensely, my tongue is covered with a white film that looks like oral thrush.  I guess the new pH formula wasn&#x27;t much of an improvement for me.  I have stopped using Biotene and would not recommend it to anyone with a sensitive mouth.  The flavor is overwhelming, it burns while brushing, and you cannot get rid of the taste no matter how much you rinse after brushing. If they bring back the old formula, I will happily buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> When I bought these toothpastes after years of use, I would think I had ordered the wrong one because, instead of soothing my mouth, they would inflame it.  It wasn&#x27;t until I read these recent posts that I realized the problem was a formula change.  WHY? If I were paranoid, I would think some sort of electronic monitoring system implanted on me makes manufacturers quit making products I like.  (The same gremlin puts brands I like on supermarket shelves either next to the floor or too high to reach.)  I have just ordered something which purports to be the original formula.  We will see.  Don&#x27;t buy this one if your mouth gets sore from ordinary toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I am on chemotherapy and I could not live without this.  The mint gel leaves a pleasant taste in my mouth too.</li>
    <li> I have Sjogrens which causes dry mouth. I used to feel like my breath was bad almost immediately after brushing my teeth. Well, it turns out that traditional toothpastes were just enhancing my dry mouth and therefore lending to my quick bad breath from dry mouth. This toothpaste is life changing!</li>
    <li> Great for dry mouth relief</li>
    <li> I am a long time biotene user but their recent &amp;#34;pH balanced&amp;#34; formulas have ruined both their mouthwash and toothpaste.  Both are now harsh and burn my mouth.  Why in the world would you take a product that is designed to help people with the sensitivities of dry mouth and ruin it for your customer base by making it harsh.  This makes no sense, but it is true.  Do not buy biotene products and maybe the company will eventually get the message and go back to the tried and true products that helped so many people.  It is a shame that so many have to suffer for the sins of a company.</li>
    <li> Under a cheaper production with new company &amp;  now has some new rather unhealthy sweeteners  &amp; soapy  foaming agents instead of the original &amp; now has no bio active enzymes which were the  product&#x27;s claim to fame in the first place. Sadly, will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste as it doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth.</li>
    <li> This saved me a trip to the local &amp;#34;mart&amp;#34; store. I have a dry mouth and love the light mintyness (I just made up that word) of this.</li>
    <li> I have Sjogrins Syndrome so my mouth is very very dry and regular toothpaste burns my mouth.  This is pH balanced and doesn&#x27;t burn at all.  I am a dental hygienist and have been reading the reviews.  I have noticed that some people are upset about the discontinuation of the biofilm removing paste, well it comes in a rinse now.  I highly recommend this toothpaste in conjunction with the regular Biotene rinse.</li>
