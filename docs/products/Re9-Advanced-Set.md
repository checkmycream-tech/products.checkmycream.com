      <li>I love Arbonne and have been using it for many years.</li>

      <li>This product caused a great amount of skin irritation burning and itching, something I&#x27;ve never experienced with this great product before.</li>
      <li>Offered a free consolation gift and then didn&#x27;t not deliver it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are fantastic skin care products.  </li>
      <li>I bought the Re9 Advanced Set at a friend&#x27;s party from an Arbonne rep.  </li>
      <li>Product was very good but found that it absorbed into the skin easily and felt dry afterwards.  </li>
      <li>The best skin care product when it comes to moisturizer, especially for older women like myself.</li>
      <li>The moisturizers, toner, eye repair creme, face wash and \\&quot;instant lift\\&quot; are truly remarkable.  </li>
      <li>I was excited that I had found it cheaper on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Re9 Advanced Set for about 2 years and can&#x27;t say enough good things about this \\&quot;system.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I originally ordered this (full set) at over $200 plus a travel set for $67.</li>
      <li>These are the best products on the market, especially used properly (i.e. the full RE9 Advanced \\&quot;SET\\&quot;).  </li>
      <li>It states it is full sized items, but it is not.</li>
      <li>Arbonne is a great product I have been using the RE9 for 6 years and my skin looks soft, and young.</li>
      <li>The product seemed fabulous in the first week.</li>
      <li>There are many other great products out there that work even better for much less</li>
      <li>so you have to decide if it is worth it</li>
      <li>Yes, I spend a lot on products, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Ordering through the company insures products are fresh - there is no stock-piling of products by the company or legitimate consultants.</li>
      <li>had used this product in the past and had great success with it.  </li>
      <li>And, a new discount client would qualify to select a free gift- up to $102 in value.</li>
      <li>My husband and I really enjoy our new look.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better facial kits I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>However I have received more compliments on my skin the last month.  </li>
      <li>I love everything that is included in this set and have found that each individual product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>Simple, not pressured to buy more, sell and/or figure out all their sales and discounts.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>Interested please contact me for a 35% discount at patriciacannon.myarbonne@gmail.com, thanks for reading.</li>
      <li>Other than washing my face once per day and using sunscreen religiously, I didn&#x27;t have a regular routine, and I figured it was a good time to get in the habit of taking better care of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted it to work.</li>
      <li>My friend sells Arbonne and I have been fighting with her for years because I couldn&#x27;t imagine spending so much money on skin care.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I decided to buy the whole set.</li>
      <li>My order came extremely fast.  </li>
      <li>And once again the \\&quot;full set\\&quot; arrived, but was actually a travel set.</li>
      <li>Perhaps, this particular product may have expired, no visible dates on product.</li>
      <li>(My dermatologist also highly recommends these products.)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light and natural, as Arbonne only use natural ingredients for their products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Arbonne products for a few years now and love them.  </li>
      <li>I should also mention, you will be sure to get lots of little goodies, new product samples, invitations to open houses, and holiday parties from your very generous consultant and maybe even new friend!  </li>
      <li>I call it Arbonne Crack, because once you get a taste, nothing else will do, and you can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m mid-40&#x27;s, with a few fine lines...</li>
      <li>It repairs damage, softens fine lines and wrinkles and smooths out uneven tone.</li>
      <li>the products pictured are the old packaging so they could be over four years old.</li>
      <li>, I feel that the shelf life is old.  </li>
      <li>Due to a very small percentage of preservatives and large percentage of natural ingredients, they have a shorter shelf life than most products on the market (most last 7-10 years due to high preservative content).</li>
      <li>I thought the products worked decent, but did not feel they were worth the high price for the small amount of product you receive.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you review the return policy prior to purchasing since the product cannot be returned.</li>
      <li>One thing though, it took a little too long (~ 12 days) for the seller to ship, and I received the set in a plastic wrapping instead of a standard shipping card board box, but thankfully the products safely arrived without damage.</li>
      <li>Major dissatisfaction with product and return</li>
      <li>And purchasing it would qualify the client for another $125 worth of any products for only $25 (plus other specials).</li>
      <li>Also, Arbonne offers discounts and a 45-day money back guarantee.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find this set at such a discounted price.  </li>
      <li>Get it directly from Arbonne or from a local representative.</li>
      <li>you hold the bottles up to the light, you can see that the bottom inch of them is hollow, so you are getting even less product than you realize.</li>
      <li>I enjoy all the Arbonne products I have purchased, they are just SO expensive that I am very limited to how much I can buy.</li>

<li> How long was this set sitting around?</li>
<li> I tried a few samples from a consultant locally and was instantly a fan.  </li>
<li> The weather here in Alaska can be very dry and windy.</li>
<li> They are quite expensive, but I think worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Arbonne and have been using it for many years. I saw the inexpensive price list on Amazon and decided to buy it from here. I originally ordered this (full set) at over $200 plus a travel set for $67. Imagine my surprise when what I received was two travel sets. I contacted Amazon, explained the situation and returned it at no cost to me. I then ordered it a second time. And once again the \\&quot;full set\\&quot; arrived, but was actually a travel set. And this time one of the bottles had opened and the contents was dried all over everything else. I once again sent it back.  I checked the listing again. It states it is full sized items, but it is not. It is the travel size. Do not waste your money on this incredibly expensive travel set. Get it directly from Arbonne or from a local representative. That&#x27;s what I will do from now on.</li>
    <li> My friend sells Arbonne and I have been fighting with her for years because I couldn&#x27;t imagine spending so much money on skin care.  Well one day I gave in and have been hooked ever since - that was two years ago. I call it Arbonne Crack, because once you get a taste, nothing else will do, and you can&#x27;t live without it.  It does exactly what it says it does. It repairs damage, softens fine lines and wrinkles and smooths out uneven tone. I get tons of compliments on my skin. I think if they would just cut down on the fancy packaging, then they could lower the cost. The set works together in concert with each other. If you had to use only one item, start off with the night creme. Soon you will see just how good this stuff really is. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Re9 Advanced Set for about 2 years and can&#x27;t say enough good things about this \\&quot;system.\\&quot;  The serum that comes with the set is excellent and does actually repair skin and minimize wrinkles. I love everything that is included in this set and have found that each individual product does exactly what it says it will do.  Furthermore, the individual products work together to achieve excellent results. The moisturizers, toner, eye repair creme, face wash and \\&quot;instant lift\\&quot; are truly remarkable.  I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, but then, you usually get what you pay for. (My dermatologist also highly recommends these products.)</li>
    <li> These are fantastic skin care products.  They have already made a difference in my skin care routine.  They are quite expensive, but I think worth it.</li>
    <li> I love Arbonne; it&#x27;s my favorite skincare line.  The product shipped quickly and was in great condition.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t the expecting each item to be so big. Nice.  Arbonne is a excellent skin care line.</li>
    <li> I tried a few samples from a consultant locally and was instantly a fan.  However when I started to look thru the catalog and saw the pricing I was a little put off.  So just to get a starter kit line I found this amazing offer on Amazon, my first place to look for the best deals ever.  I&#x27;ve had it awhile now and will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I have a friend who is an Arbonne consultant, that&#x27;s how I got to know about their great products. She gave me the samples of this RE9 anti-aging line, and I think I&#x27;d seen improvements. That&#x27;s why I decided to buy the whole set. The fragrance is wonderful. It&#x27;s so light and natural, as Arbonne only use natural ingredients for their products. This is a good buy for good value compared to the full price on their website. One thing though, it took a little too long (~ 12 days) for the seller to ship, and I received the set in a plastic wrapping instead of a standard shipping card board box, but thankfully the products safely arrived without damage. I also noticed the box for the set must have been opened before, but after investigating the conents, I guessed they were not opened. Bottom line, 5 stars for the products and 3 stars for the seller.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better facial kits I&#x27;ve used. One cringes when you consider spending so much on facial care products, however, I&#x27;ve used this for two years and I know it has definitely made a difference in how my skin looks and feels!</li>
    <li> Product was very good but found that it absorbed into the skin easily and felt dry afterwards.  Not worth that price.</li>
    <li> Online outlet sales of Arbonne products is prohibited by company policy- they should only be obtained through the company via an independent consultant. Due to a very small percentage of preservatives and large percentage of natural ingredients, they have a shorter shelf life than most products on the market (most last 7-10 years due to high preservative content). Since expiration dates are only found on products with SPF, there is no way to know the age of these products on Amazon. Ordering through the company insures products are fresh - there is no stock-piling of products by the company or legitimate consultants. Also, Arbonne offers discounts and a 45-day money back guarantee. The set listed here can be purchased for as little as $210, depending on discount status. And purchasing it would qualify the client for another $125 worth of any products for only $25 (plus other specials). And, a new discount client would qualify to select a free gift- up to $102 in value. Also I must add: product packaging changed spring of 2012- the products pictured are the old packaging so they could be over four years old. Arbonne unopened shelf life is two years; 10 months after opening. How long was this set sitting around? Were the products opened? How would you know? Please, if you love Arbonne like I do, be safe, satisfied and get more bang for your buck by ordering through the company! You can have your own ID# and enjoy the convenience of online ordering 24-7.</li>
    <li> I love Arbonne products.  I love buying it online rather than through a dealer.  Simple, not pressured to buy more, sell and/or figure out all their sales and discounts.  Drives me nuts!  Just want the product and be on my way.  My order came extremely fast.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have used Arbonne before but always find it a bit too pricey.  However I have received more compliments on my skin the last month.  One neighbor told me she thought I looked younger than I did last year.</li>
    <li> it really makes your skin feel great. I like it a lot but the price is steep so you have to decide if it is worth it</li>
    <li> These are the best products on the market, especially used properly (i.e. the full RE9 Advanced \\&quot;SET\\&quot;).  You will get much better pricing, product knowledge and customer service if you go through a consultant.  The pricing varies from 20% and 35% off retail along with 50% and 80% opportunities when purchases are at various levels or you host a party.  Your consultant honors the 45 day return policy for any reason (better than Nordstrom).  Your consultant will make sure your skin care, health and wellness and, if desired, business opportunity needs are met.  I should also mention, you will be sure to get lots of little goodies, new product samples, invitations to open houses, and holiday parties from your very generous consultant and maybe even new friend!  This is the best way to go and you too, will LOVE Arbonne like I do!! [...]</li>
    <li> I thought the products worked decent, but did not feel they were worth the high price for the small amount of product you receive. There are many other great products out there that work even better for much less money.&lt;br /&gt;If you hold the bottles up to the light, you can see that the bottom inch of them is hollow, so you are getting even less product than you realize. I find this deceiving and will not buy them again. They are a terrible overall value, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The best skin care product when it comes to moisturizer, especially for older women like myself. Love the citrus smell and consistency.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and easy to use. The entire system used  properly will take years off your appearance. My husband and I really enjoy our new look.</li>
    <li> Major dissatisfaction with product and return policy.&lt;br /&gt;I had used this product in the past and had great success with it.  I moved and lost connection with my rep.  I was excited that I had found it cheaper on Amazon.com.  I received the product and was very disappointed.  The product was not the same. This product caused a great amount of skin irritation burning and itching, something I&#x27;ve never experienced with this great product before. Perhaps, this particular product may have expired, no visible dates on product. I highly recommend you review the return policy prior to purchasing since the product cannot be returned. &amp;#34;Must have had to many returned&amp;#34;. I will never order this product from Amazon again. I recommend you contact a rep in your area, that way you can at least exchange the item to accommodate for dry, oily, or combination skin types.</li>
    <li> I enjoy all the Arbonne products I have purchased, they are just SO expensive that I am very limited to how much I can buy.</li>
    <li> The product more than met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love arbonne</li>
    <li> I have managed skin care consultants and sold Mary Kay Skin products, previously.  I began using Arbonne face and skin products in 2007, and have been very pleased with the results, until I received this order.  I am very disappointed in the Re9 Advanced Set which I received.  Upon opening the package, the Arbonne product box was damaged with the products out of the plastic holders for shipping.  The packing material was insufficient/poor packing.  I have used for almost 7 years and in smelling the product received and my skin&#x27;s reaction, I feel that the shelf life is old.  I will never entrust my skin to a mail product again or to a skin consultant that I do not personally know when I know I ordered the correct product for my skin.</li>
    <li> Product arrived mostly as advertised, except for the lack of travel size neck repair cream. Also, I was disappointed in the change of packaging. The skin cleanser did not have a cap.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money buying Arbonne products from anyone else other than an Arbonne Independent Consultant, guaranteed you will receive what you pay for with a massive discount, plus your products will arrive just off the production line and not from the back of someone&#x27;s cupboard that are years old!!! Interested please contact me for a 35% discount at patriciacannon.myarbonne@gmail.com, thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> At $125. off of the retail price, this was a great buy. The product seemed fabulous in the first week. I saw seemingly dramatic results, until week three, or so. Now it doesn&#x27;t seem to be holding up as well. I&#x27;m mid-40&#x27;s, with a few fine lines...no deep wrinkles. Good communication from the seller.</li>
    <li> I am always complimented on my youthful face. Most people think I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and I just turned 70. Yes, I spend a lot on products, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It was received as expected</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  My wife loves this brand and her skin is noticeably smoother after switching to Arbonne.</li>
    <li> loved the both more than satisfactory good quality and looked as it was illustrated and the arbonne was super love love it</li>
    <li> I bought the Re9 Advanced Set at a friend&#x27;s party from an Arbonne rep.  I bought it simply to get into a skin care routine.  I am 38 years old and have very fair skin.  Other than washing my face once per day and using sunscreen religiously, I didn&#x27;t have a regular routine, and I figured it was a good time to get in the habit of taking better care of my skin.  After using the product for 15 days, a friend commented on my skin, saying \\&quot;it was glowing.\\&quot;  Enough said.</li>
    <li> Arbonne is a great product I have been using the RE9 for 6 years and my skin looks soft, and young. The weather here in Alaska can be very dry and windy. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> Be careful! You are probably buying an expired product from a former consultant.  Probably the reason why you are not seeing the benefits of this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels with this product! Noticeable improvement of my skin texture, tone and color.  (sun spots are gone). This vendor took two months to get this product to me. Offered a free consolation gift and then didn&#x27;t not deliver it.&lt;br /&gt;So, love the product but not the vendor!</li>
    <li> I stopped using proactive and started using the RE9 Advanced set as well as the Arbonne acne cleansers, but it actually made it worse.  I even started using proactive again with the Arbonne, but I still had acne.  Once I stopped using the Arbonne products and continued to use proactive, my acne cleared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really bummed that this product caused me acne.  I really wanted it to work.</li>
    <li> Love Love this line...My face feels and looks awesome</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Arbonne products for a few years now and love them.  I was surprised to find this set at such a discounted price.  I ordered the set on Tuesday, Nov. 6 and it was on my doorstep this morning, Friday, Nov. 9.  Thank you for such a speedy delivery...I will order in the future!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product direct from Arbonne and have been very happy with it.  I decided to order from Amazon because&lt;br /&gt;it was a little cheaper in price.  I thought I would be receiving the same set but was very disappointed.  The box it came in was&lt;br /&gt;torn apart and looked like some of the product had been used also smaller container for the face cream.  One bottle was&lt;br /&gt;missing a lid.  Will not order this product from Amazon again.</li>
