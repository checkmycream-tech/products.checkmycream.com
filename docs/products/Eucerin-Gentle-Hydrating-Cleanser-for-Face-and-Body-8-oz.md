      <li>Since I have been using this face cream, some of the wrinkles that I had, seem to be smoothing out reducing fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Recently, however, I was told by my dermatologist to use a moisturizer and in the course of researching moisturizers, I discovered the Eucerin moisturizer, which is great, and also this cleanser.</li>
      <li>I have never paid much attention to what kind of soap I use.</li>

      <li>&quot; clean.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product if you have very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I usually love Eucerin products because they&#x27;re so gentle</li>
      <li>Best product I have found for my dry sensitive face.  </li>
      <li>It is very gentle! )</li>
      <li>Sensitive skin may work better with this product.</li>
      <li>and this went right in the trash.  </li>
      <li>but first I am going to look up the reviews.</li>
      <li>Sorta like the first one.</li>
      <li>First bought one bottle and afterwards ordered a set of four.</li>
      <li>pretty moisturized.</li>
      <li>Sure enough when I was done washing my face</li>
      <li>I have use Eucerin Face Cream and Cleanser for many years and look younger then my 77 years of age.  </li>
      <li>Eucerin Sensitive Skin Gentle Hydrating Cleanser leaves my face feeling smooth and moist.</li>
      <li>and this is good stuff that is a little hard to spread but does really good for moisture.</li>
      <li>Either way my skin is kept moisturized and protected while becoming smoother and younger every day.  </li>
      <li>but this is going to be ideal for me (sensitive, middle aged skin) in the summer.  </li>
      <li>overal i was very please how it kept my skin clean and clear.</li>
      <li>i have super sensitive skin)</li>
      <li>Okay people are saying it leaves my face dry blahblahblah</li>
      <li>I was so dissapointing because of the name \\&quot;GENTLE HYDRATING CLEANSER\\</li>
      <li>i really like this product but over time my skin didnt agree (not products fault</li>
      <li>I used it one time and soon realized it would irritate too much to continue it&#x27;s use.</li>
      <li>but they really dropped the ball when they made this stuff.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>When i travel and have to use hotel soaps, even quality soaps, I can really feel the difference.  </li>
      <li>Smells too much like sunscreen, I am not sold on this.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I finally found something that works for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I generally take a short break and luxuriate with a glass of refreshing juice or water</li>
      <li>try phisoderm deep cleaning cream cleanser for sensitive skin or nivea for men sensitive face wash, or neutrogena extra gentle cleanser if your in need of a good face wash for dry/sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light foaming action leaves your skin feeling soft and not dried out.</li>
      <li>Eucerin Sensitive Skin Gentle Hydrating Cleanser is just that!  </li>
      <li>After reading some mixed reviews, I decided to give it a try as I very much like their sensitive wrinkle free moisturizer for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>My face not only feels clean, but it feels alive and \\&quot;squeaky\\</li>
      <li>During the times when I was unable to find or order Eucerin, my skin suffered greatly; I would get clogged pours and an increase in acne without Eucerin.</li>
      <li>Like a bird persistent dry patch luckily that does not show</li>
      <li>&quot; but man was that far from the truth!</li>
      <li>but it is really gentle and does not dry.</li>
      <li>My sensitive but oily skin is so clear and glowy!</li>
      <li>I simply have never had such a feeling on my face as the first time I used this!</li>
      <li>then return to either apply a bit of my Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion for day use or my Q10 Anti Wrinkle night cream to sleep in.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed a complete change in my skin quality.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and some cleansers</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t completely achieve the results I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>young to old....</li>
      <li>This is coming from someone who has used every cleansing product and moisturizing product ever made for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is the best product I&#x27;ve found for dry facial skin during the cold northeast winter months.</li>
      <li>Not much to say about the product except it cleanses thoroughly without drying the skin, which is exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I am a male, but I use alot of women&#x27;s products becuase my skin is so sensitive.</li>
      <li>This is not what I expected when I was in search of a gentle basic cleanser that wouldnt strip my skin and hopefully leave it not tight and not dry!  </li>
      <li>Its just an amazing product for anyone who suffers from very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It removes oil and dirt, but does not dry my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does not dry out my skin, but cleans well.</li>
      <li>This is just not a product for sensitive or dry skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best product I have found for my dry sensitive face.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years and will continue.</li>
    <li> There is a good agreement among reviewers already, I just wanted to add my 5 cents )   It is very gentle! ) Works good for my sensitive skin. I will order more when this bottle ends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 30 years.  During the times when I was unable to find or order Eucerin, my skin suffered greatly; I would get clogged pours and an increase in acne without Eucerin. I have three children, and all three have some sensitivity to regular soaps.  We don&#x27;t have any issues when we use Eucerin.</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected when I was in search of a gentle basic cleanser that wouldnt strip my skin and hopefully leave it not tight and not dry!  This cleanser was a huge FAIL!!!! From the moment it came out of the bottle I could tell it would be drying to my face because it felt and smelt so soapy!!  Sure enough when I was done washing my face it was so dry and uncomfortable that it hurt to smile haha no joke.  I used it once and this went right in the trash.  I was so dissapointing because of the name \\&quot;GENTLE HYDRATING CLEANSER\\&quot; but man was that far from the truth! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this... try phisoderm deep cleaning cream cleanser for sensitive skin or nivea for men sensitive face wash, or neutrogena extra gentle cleanser if your in need of a good face wash for dry/sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My entire family likes this product a great deal because it is effective, and cleans very well for almost any kind of skin. Sensitive skin may work better with this product.</li>
    <li> I have never paid much attention to what kind of soap I use. Yes, a typical male attitude I suppose. Recently, however, I was told by my dermatologist to use a moisturizer and in the course of researching moisturizers, I discovered the Eucerin moisturizer, which is great, and also this cleanser. I simply have never had such a feeling on my face as the first time I used this! And the feeling continues each time I use it. My face not only feels clean, but it feels alive and \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean. Wish I would have discovered this many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that, as far as I can tell, Eucerin does not make a travel size of 3 oz. I wish they would. When i travel and have to use hotel soaps, even quality soaps, I can really feel the difference.  Count me a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> Arrived beautifully wrapped to minimize environmental impact and keep shipping weight at a minimum as well.  Bravo for the Eucerin products and the great marketing for both the earth and Eucerin customers.  Eucerin Sensitive Skin Gentle Hydrating Cleanser is just that!  It feels wonderful when applied...uses just a dab to do the job.....washes off leaving nothing but cool, refreshing, cleanliness.  I generally take a short break and luxuriate with a glass of refreshing juice or water then return to either apply a bit of my Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion for day use or my Q10 Anti Wrinkle night cream to sleep in.  Either way my skin is kept moisturized and protected while becoming smoother and younger every day.  The expense is minimal and the luxurious results are maximal.  I am a happy camper and recommend  Eucerin skin products to everyone....young to old....all types of skin.</li>
    <li> Not too impressed.  Sorta like the first one.</li>
    <li> I am sure this is a good product for some. I am 49 and have dry/acne-prone skin and this stripped my skin raw. I used it one time and soon realized it would irritate too much to continue it&#x27;s use. I am a male, but I use alot of women&#x27;s products becuase my skin is so sensitive. I was also looking for a gentle moisterizer and tried the Eucerin moisturizer and found that it burned my skin really bad and had to stop use. I recently tried Purpose for sensitive skin, it strips a little but it is really gentle and does not dry. I now use Olay all day moisterizer and this is good stuff that is a little hard to spread but does really good for moisture.</li>
    <li> Used this for over ten years!! I use oil to remove my makeup and then use this afterward... My sensitive but oily skin is so clear and glowy! Love it! I also use their q10 butter creme.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product out because I love their lotions. It didn&#x27;t amazing job taking makeup off without having to use cotton pads etc.... However the product must have an ingredient that does cause a rash like another reviewer stated.. Literally cost me burn to my lip area and area above the lip as well as forehead.. Like a bird persistent dry patch luckily that does not show but I can feel it</li>
    <li> I am still determining this products effectiveness.  I&#x27;ve used it only 3-4 times and for only three weeks.  I hope to offer my final decision following my fifth use.</li>
    <li> nice product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and some cleansers leave my skin feeling dry. Eucerin Sensitive Skin Gentle Hydrating Cleanser leaves my face feeling smooth and moist. Also, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product if you have very sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s light foaming action leaves your skin feeling soft and not dried out.</li>
    <li> This is coming from someone who has used every cleansing product and moisturizing product ever made for sensitive skin. It is by far the best I have used. Ever since I started using it I have noticed a complete change in my skin quality. It doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin or make it too dry. It&#x27;s also been helping with my acne a lot too. Its just an amazing product for anyone who suffers from very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It was ok but it didn&#x27;t completely achieve the results I was looking for.  May try again in the future.</li>
    <li> Smells too much like sunscreen, I am not sold on this. My eyes did allot of watering when using this and the other eucerine q10 cream.</li>
    <li> It is not hydrating, period, end of story. I love their lotion but they really dropped the ball when they made this stuff. Found out it is not marketed in all areas of the United States and now after using it I know why. It is a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have use Eucerin Face Cream and Cleanser for many years and look younger then my 77 years of age.  Since I have been using this face cream, some of the wrinkles that I had, seem to be smoothing out reducing fine lines.  It moisturizes  the skin and prevents the dry skin itchiness and keeps the skin firm.</li>
    <li> I usually love Eucerin products because they&#x27;re so gentle but this one is not. I has a scent that irritates my eyes and it dries out my skin, after I use it I immediately have to put on face lotion. This is just not a product for sensitive or dry skin.</li>
    <li> i am a big eucerin user. i really like this product but over time my skin didnt agree (not products fault i have super sensitive skin) overal i was very please how it kept my skin clean and clear.</li>
    <li> Only wash I use on my face. I have sensitive skin and this cleans without irritating and does not clog my pores.</li>
    <li> Seems awesome, doesnt make me tear up, covers really well, it seems so soapy and yet its so smooth and leaves you pretty moisturized. I like it!</li>
    <li> I love all things Eucerin and this is no exception.  This cleanser is very gentle and quite effective.  I wish it were a tad more creamy but this is going to be ideal for me (sensitive, middle aged skin) in the summer.  (In Europe there are soooo many fabulous Eucerin skin care products that we don&#x27;t have in the USA.....too bad.  I hope Eucerin will expand States side some day.)</li>
    <li> After reading some mixed reviews, I decided to give it a try as I very much like their sensitive wrinkle free moisturizer for sensitive skin.  Unfortunately, it caused my skin to break out into itchy hives so I&#x27;ve stopped using this product.  The vendor was great though and ensured a quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This face wash is amazing!  My skin has never been better.  I am so glad that I finally found something that works for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Okay people are saying it leaves my face dry blahblahblah anything u wash ur face with ur face is going to be dry afterswards thats why you put MOISTERIZER ON YOUR FACE!. even if u splash ur face with water your face going to feel dry anyway. I like it i believe its getting rid of my dark blemishes i have on the leftbottom  side of my cheek and chin i see it dissapearing. So I am gonna continue using this I dont break out from this at all and I am going to buy the moisterizer but first I am going to look up the reviews. I usually dont put anything n my face I feel it will break my face out no matter WHAT it is.</li>
    <li> This soap is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It removes oil and dirt, but does not dry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best product I&#x27;ve found for dry facial skin during the cold northeast winter months.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Not much to say about the product except it cleanses thoroughly without drying the skin, which is exactly what it is supposed to do. First bought one bottle and afterwards ordered a set of four.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Feels great on my skin, the pump makes it super easy to use, very helpful for my sometimes dry/ sometimes oily/ combination skin. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing the job nicely.  Does not dry out my skin, but cleans well.</li>
    <li> The only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face nor cause me to break out. It&#x27;s better than cetaphil because it doesn&#x27;t have all the parabans. In fact, it doesn&#x27;t have many chemicals at all which is why I love this cleanser</li>
