    <li> Get glamorous looking eye&#x27;s with Crave Naturals Brow and Lash Kit. All you need are these two tools that have four functions. No need to have so many separate makeup tools anymore. These tools come in a very stylish canister so you never lose your brushes again. The Brown and Lash Kit includes the Lash Perfection Comb and the Duo Ended Masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;The Duo Ended Masterpiece is an angled brow brush and a spoolie. The angled brow brush is used to create shape and fill in your brows to give you a more defined looking brow. Simply brush your brows upwards and use the angled brush to apply powder or gel to your brows. Once applied, use the spoolie to even out and blend color for a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;The Lash Perfection Comb is an eyelash comb and brow brush. The eyelash comb used to remove excess mascara to avoid the spider like lashes which result in clump free, beautiful, separated eye lashes. This is a must have tool for me. I always have a problem with my mascara clumping and it does not look so good. To use this tool, simply apply your mascara. While lashes are still wet, starts at the lash line and comb upwards to remove clumps and separate lashes. If need, apply another coat and mascara and repeat with the comb. This will leave you with perfectly separated eye lashes and your eye&#x27;s will look amazing! Simply turn over the eyelash comb and you have a brow brush. Use the brow brush to shape and style your eyebrows, creating a volumized, bushy effect.&lt;br /&gt;These 2 tools are always in my makeup bag. I could definitely not accomplish my look without them. Now with this stylish canister, I will never have to digging for the tools.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to try in exchange for sharing my honest opinion. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and my opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging, it is really cute for gift giving! This product is exactly what I expected and I am very pleased with the quality. What really sets this product apart from others is the excellent customer service. After purchase I received an email with some very helpful tips. Also, the shipping was super fast. Overall I am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> love this kit i have been using it for 2 weeks and really like how the brushes work</li>
    <li> This kit is everything I need in one when it comes to grooming my brows &amp; lashes. This 4-in-2 kit contains a Lash Perfection Comb &amp; a Duo Ended Masterpiece of an angled brow brush &amp; a spoolie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am by no means an expert when it comes to eye makeup, but I am trying to learn. (Better late than never, right?) So it&#x27;s somewhat nice to know that I&#x27;ve been doing it all wrong all along! The Lash Perfection Comb does wonders to help de-clump my mascara when I put it on, but I had no idea I could use a spoolie on my eyebrows to help soften up the look.</li>
    <li> Packaging is cute. I love when things come in cite packaging. When I received my product and opened it, the spoolie, was unattached. A little more glue will help it keep it intact. Other than that, as my first impression, the quality of the brushes are really good. I have yet to try them, but once I do..I will come back with another review.</li>
    <li> Good quality, sturdy, and very cute packaging. Def would buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> Used this product today for the first time and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Such a cute little kit</li>
    <li> Came in a super, cute box love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I really like the package it came in, but If I didn&#x27;t buy it for a $1 then I would never pay for the actual price they are asking for. The eyebrow and eyelash brush comb look and feels very cheap, I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Super cute packaging and came quick only problem is the brush heads fall off. First time taking the brushes out of the packaging two of the brushes were not attached to the wands. Easy fix with a bit of glue.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about these items was the beautiful packaging which is used to store the items.  The eyelashes brush is perfect for a natural look.  I like the way the brush is on one side and eyebrow brush is on the other side.</li>
    <li> Great Brushes! good quality and happy for my purchase ;)</li>
    <li> Nice and cute. Easy to carry. They are now part of my traveling bag. The brush arrived glued off, which was not a big deal for me, I just glued it back on and no problem.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a great eyebrow brush to have in your makeup kit! The eyebrow brush was soft  but yet firm enough to contour my brows perfectly!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Delivered as expected. I love it! It has now become my daily tool to use.</li>
    <li> Loved these products! Worked very well and made with good quality.</li>
    <li> What a cute set this is.  The packaging is adorable.  They did a great job on the design of this set.  It is two pieces but both items have multiple uses.  The brush is a lash brush as well as an eyebrow brush.  I use the eyebrow brush to get my eyebrows in the shape that I want first.  My eyebrows are light and thin so I must then take a shadow for brows and lightly brush that on using the angled end of the brush.  I then use eyebrow gel and lightly brush that on using the spoolie.  After my brows are done, I put on my eyeliner.  I can either use a pencil to do this.  Sometimes I also use eyeshadow as a liner.  I can use the angled brush for this purpose as well.  I just make sure that all of the brow powder is off by wiping it clean.  Lastly, I apply my mascara.  I use both the spoolie and the eyelash brush to separate my eyelashes.  This is done so that any clumps of mascara are removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is very practical for anyone who likes to use eye makeup.  I think that it would also make a wonderful gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a discount on this product to use it and review it.  However, all of the opinions are my own.  I only purchase products that I will use myself.</li>
    <li> I really like the eyelash comb for separating my lashes after my mascara. The slanted brush is not firm enough to do my eyebrows but it is very soft. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> It fell apart the second day I bought it I was so upset but the customer service was great they sent me a brand new one that was perfectly fine  I love it they have a life time warranty I would recommend this product thank you guys</li>
    <li> Omg this set is awesome for brow makeup application. Both brushes are of great quality. The packaging is so cute and durable. Awesome for storing the brushes.</li>
    <li> Great little makeup product! Wanted it for my mascara and it&#x27;s the perfect sizeand nice quality.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this new addition to her cosmetics trove. Her eyebrows and lashes couldn&#x27;t look any better. :D</li>
    <li> This kit is exactly what I needed! Love how one brush is double ended! This kit is hands down the best;</li>
    <li> I received this very quickly in the mail and am impressed by the quality. It came in a big cylinder looking package - very cute. I want to purchase a few more for friends.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set.  It comes with cute retro packaging.  Just the tool I need for applying eyebrow powder.  It makes my powder goes long way and looks natural on my face.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service. I only use the  eyebrow comb which is good  quality.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it and returned it.</li>
    <li> As soon I received this, I&#x27;m impressed with the packaging. I was in desperate need to replacing my eyebrow and eyelash brushes and this came in perfect timing. It works well with me and the application goes smooth. I love that both are double ended and very easy to use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love love love this set!! I am so glad I bought this set!</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes! Love the cute box they come in.</li>
    <li> I do LOVE this 4 in 1 set~ All of the brushes are extremely soft and very high quality. The brushes and comb are sized just right and work very well. Its easy to use,and makes my eyebrows and eyelashes look wonderful. its sturdy and high quality. Also, packaging tube is a fun addition. This set is so cute and I&#x27;d definitely highly recommend it to my friends!!</li>
    <li> I like this one. It works well and the price wasn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
    <li> I have only used this brush 4 times and the brush came off.</li>
    <li> The brushes are poor quality!! It&#x27;s not worth it if buying the listing price without promotion code.</li>
    <li> came broken but works</li>
    <li> When u opened my item the brush wasn&#x27;t attached. It&#x27;s ok tho I&#x27;ll just glue it! Other than that it&#x27;s a good product for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I just tested the spool end out so far but i love the material and the packaging was so cute!!</li>
    <li> I liked the brush kit but was disappointed that the slant tip was not actually attached to the lash wand as shown in the photo.  You have to attach it yourself to the wand brush and will have to pinch it to keep it on or it slides off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like that the kit contains 4 tools in in just 2 items (saving room in my kit and easy to carry.)  The packaging is nice as it comes in a decorative carton tube as shown.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Packaging is super cute! I would give it a 5 star on that.&lt;br /&gt;The product on the other hand was broken before I open it. I was so excited to receive it and just as diassapointed when I took it out of package.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this comb kit! It comes in a very cute tubing.  Brushes are easy to use on eyelashes and eyebrows.  Eyelash brush helps take out any clumped together eyelashes to give a full effect.  And the eyebrow brush helps to tame crazy eyebrows and keep them in place for a great look.</li>
    <li> Cute little set~ Love it!</li>
    <li> Cute packaging but really cheap brushes. One of the brushes had already came unglued when it arrived. They seem like brushes you would get from the dollar store.</li>
    <li> This broke within 1 week of use. The metal part for the eyebrow brush simply snapped off.</li>
    <li> This item arrived very quickly and I absolutely love the case. However, the lash comb came apart as soon as I took it out of the super cute packaging. Never had a chance to use it. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me a new one. Unfortunately the new set they sent me also came with the brow brush unattached. I will just super glue it and try to use it that way. Overall, not the best quality, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Just received my order and couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a week now since I used this product.  I use it with my dip down pomade, and I love it. It blends well, the brush is a little firm just the way I like it. I also use the spooley to comb my eyebrow hair first then the brush at the end. Overall, a great product. Must try!</li>
    <li> The brush is very stiff which is very good for brow. The customer service is very good. They follow up after the delivery to make sure that you are happy with your purchase. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Biggest waste of money ever. The eyebrow liner/brush tip came off as soon as I took it out of the cylinder. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> I got a promotion code for this kit and it was very cheap when I bought this. When I first used it the spoolie brush broke instantly! I am very gentle when it comes to make up brushes. Especially on my face and eyebrows. I guess you get what you pay for in regards of quality. However, I do like the packaging of the brushes since it works well for my eyeliners and my other brushes.</li>
    <li> The packaging was adorable but when I opened the tube, the double sided brush was broken. The brush side had fallen off in the tube and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it. the other piece worked fine.</li>
    <li> Sturdy brushes and easy to clean</li>
    <li> I specifically looked at this product for the brow shadow brush. Bristles are soft, which is nice, however, I like my brush to be a bit firmer. I had to apply three times to get it dark, whereas, my other brush, I would only apply twice. It is convenient, though.</li>
    <li> Love the packaging! Great products, especially like the spool.</li>
    <li> Everything came apart wasn&#x27;t sealed properly</li>
    <li> i got this for a deeply discounted price. The brush seemed functional but to my dismay it arrived broken.. Although I wasn&#x27;t able to use it, I appears to be a thin enough brush to create natural brows. I wish I could have given a better review but due to the condition it arrived in it was unusable  UPDATED  the company sent me a new one to use which is great customer service on there end. Now that I have had time to use it its great but the brush keeps detaching from the handle. So to fix it I hot glued the two together and its good as new! thanks so much!</li>
    <li> The packaging is super cute, however the set is mediocre. The spoolie came off right away before I could use it. For the price, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again since the quality of the product is poor.</li>
    <li> Like it alot just wish the brush was more stiff bit it gets everything done</li>
    <li> Loved this set. The eyelash brush has not broken yet like the previous ones made by other companies. I also like the eyebrow brush for applying eye brow makeup.</li>
    <li> I am so excited to get this.  I recently turned 40yrs old and up until I never wore makeup on a daily basis… until now.  I love my eyebrows and am sure these will help me accentuate them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a brow brush but make up brushes r really expensive. This is a very good price and worth it.</li>
    <li> The case looks cute, but the spoolie is bended.  I got this for special price, if I have to pay full price for it, then it does not worth it.</li>
    <li> I received this item in the mail today and was beyond excited to use them. Very good quality brushes. My favorite part was the instruction paper send in the tube that explained how to use each brush and the extra discount for your next purchase on the pamphlet as well!&lt;br /&gt;-Meagan Adams&lt;br /&gt;Centsable-Steals (http://www.centsablesteals.com/)</li>
    <li> Love everything about this little kit and plus you can&#x27;t really go wrong with paying a $1! To top it off shipping is fast!</li>
    <li> The products worked fine.  The packaging was nice and doing was quick.  But the quality was mediocre..</li>
    <li> I love the packaging.. cute tube! great product</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for. It comes in an adorable container, and the brushes are great quality! Thanks for making such an outstanding product!</li>
    <li> Packaging as everyone has stated is super cute. It was girly and great for keeping the brushes in. But the brushes themselves were not great quality and the brush came off when I went to take it out of the package. It would be a great tool to use but don&#x27;t know how durable it would be. If the quality of the brush was better then I would give it more stars.</li>
    <li> First the packaging these come in are super cute! This is my first actual eyebrow brush set and so far I love it!</li>
    <li> package is very cute. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me, but they very graciously refunded my money.</li>
    <li> This could not have come at a better time! I had two job interviews, I absolutely lovesd it! I moisturized the eyebrow brush a little before use. But people did notice the difference and asked if I did something different. Would defiantly recommend!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and this brushes work really nice to do your make up. If your looking for something for your eyebrows this is it! Do recommend</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use my lash comb. It simply came apart once I took it out of the super cute packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the brow kit though. I&#x27;ll try glueing the spoolie together, but meh.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when it arrived in it&#x27;s cute packaging. I love that I am able to store other items in there, like other brushes or eyeliner, if I wanted too.  I just recently lost my mac eyebrow brush, so this little kit was perfect. My favorite item from the kit is the angled eyebrow brush and spoolie 2 in one.  I travel alot so having to carry one less brush is great for me.  I used the brush and spoolie as I normally would, first brushing up the hairs in my eyebrow and then outline the bottom of my eyebrow with angled brush, then brushing the hairs down and outline the top, then brush the hair back into place and blend with the spoolie.  Fantastic results!  I&#x27;m very impressed with this eyebrow and eyelash brush comb kit.  I would definitely recommend, and give as a gift to a friend.</li>
    <li> love it...brushes are good quality and perfect for shaping my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> these two brushes are really great in durabliltiy. they work well and super good value compared to the large name brand stores. i like the packaging as well, would make a good stocking stuffer for christmas or gift in general. the value is really great. I like that the brushes have sturdy handles and dont seem that they will break easily.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Very comparable to my Anastasia Beverly Hills Brush!</li>
    <li> Awesome little kits for my eyebrow and eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Packaging is cute. Brushes seem sturdy and ready to stand up to everyday use. Crave is the brand to choose.</li>
    <li> I love the combo brush/comb and use it every day, much better then the old one that I had previously.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I finally got to use these. I just started doing my eyebrows and these work great as far as helping me shape them. I absolutely love the packaging which drew me to purchase in the first place. I&#x27;m no expert to doing makeup, but these work great.</li>
    <li> I love love love this eyebrow and eyelash brush combo! I needed it and it works great!</li>
    <li> Love it! My eyebrows are on point!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this kit. I have quite a collection of makeup brushes, however I didn&#x27;t have a eyebrow brush. Most of the time I would just use whatever brush I could find to do my brows. Since using this kit, my brows look a million times better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angled brush is the perfect width for brows. I use this with a brow powder, and it makes placing the product so easy, and you can manipulate the brush to create the illusion of eye brow hair. The brush is just overall fantastic. On the opposite end there is a spoolie. I like to use this in between swipes with the brush. I can brush out my brows, apply some product, and brush them out again. This gives my brows a very natural look, without taking away the product I just applied. It also softens them so they don&#x27;t look harsh. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next piece in the kit is the eye lash comb and brow brush. I use the eye lash brush after applying mascara and letting it dry. This will remove any clumps that your mascara may have left, and fans out your lashes to look fuller and just amazing! The brow brush I use more often when I am using an eyebrow wax. Once I apply the wax, I can use this brush to create a more natural look. Again, it&#x27;s fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this kit. It is a staple in my collection, and gets used daily. I love the packaging this comes in, if you need to travel, this is perfect! Place your brushes in the cylinder and they will be perfectly protected! 5 stars all around for this kit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> O am 36 years old and I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find a perfect eyebrow and eyelash brush kit. This shipped super fast and came in the perfect little package and would be super cute to give as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a 4 in 1 kit and made of premium quality materials. You can tell its worth as soon as you use it. The eyebrow brush really can define your eyebrows and the eyelash comb seems to add length and remove clumps for an great looking eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I bought for a gift, and she loves it.  The &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; is actually a round tube about 8-10&amp;#34; long, and maybe 1-1.5&amp;#34; diameter.  Inside are 2 brushes, one with 2 ends, for putting on mascara/eyeliner, and another for eyelashes.  The other brush is a &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; and brush for eyebrows.  Its all very high quality, and really &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; the way its packaged.  Ladies love this kind of stuff and usually wind up going to local drug store and buying them separately for 1- lots more money- 2- inferior quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why subject your lady to that?  She is going to buy and use these products, so get her something decent!!!  Not only will she be able to look great (for you), but you will also win lots of points with her.  Either way, you will be a winner in the end.</li>
    <li> I got my Crave brow and lash brush for $1 (with promotional code) and it came in two days. Packaging is so cute and darling! I love it! As for the products themselves, I would be careful with the spoolie. It is very delicate. Like the glue would come out and it will fall off from the stick. The angled brush wasnt on my spoolie by the way. It seems the glue came apart and it fell off. Does it work? Yes. It does what the applicators are intended for. Is it worth what I paid for? YES. It is worth what I paid for ($1.00) will I buy this at retail price?! Probably not. With another promotional code? Definitely! I absolutely love the package it came in though. It&#x27;s very girlie. I&#x27;m keeping it on my vanity. Friends will definitely ask where it came from :)</li>
    <li> Great quality! Super cute brushes and packaging. Really love it!</li>
    <li> Great product! Very cute packaging and even includes instructions and discount code for future products!!!</li>
    <li> Poor quality. The brow brush fell off when I open the package, and the other end the comb is falling off as well. I really like the packaging design though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times and so far I&#x27;m very happy with them!  We will see how long they last them seem pretty good quality.</li>
    <li> this is so great.  the packaging is exactly as pictured.  2 great brushed at a low cost price.  if you walk into sephora or any major dept make up store you will have to pay triple of what this little perfect set does.</li>
    <li> To brush heads were very easily (too easily, it fell off while I was looking at the brush) removed from the brush. Not very durable. The bristles seem to be okay though. Functional, but probably would not buy again.</li>
    <li> love the package love the product!</li>
    <li> Such cute packaging and everything looks exactly like the picture, nothing missing! AND quick delivery</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and it came in a cute little box.</li>
    <li> Cute packaging. But poor quality. All the ends of the brushes were off or lose.</li>
    <li> Every girl must have kit. 4 Tools in 1 comes with a great storage space. The  lash brush is very nice  to any make up kit, It comes with four professional tools to shape your eyebrows and lashes. With this kit you will be framing your face like a pro! The eyelash comb is used to DE-CLUMP AND SEPARATE  sticky clumps of lashes. Makes my eyes look bigger, I have small eyes so this comes in good use. For a good price it comes with LIFETIME GUARANTEE!!!!! I love this product, I give it 5 stars wish I can give it more. I received for free for an honest review</li>
    <li> eeh, the angle brush is too soft for me but I loved the spoolie however, it broke. ( quality issues I guess ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the eyebrows comb its nice I use it always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this item was too expensive for the quality it offered.</li>
    <li> So this would be my first time hearing about this brand and testing out one of their products. I was in major need for an eyebrow and eyelash brushes. This product, Crave Naturals - Eyebrow and Eyelash Brush Kit, seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. I really love the dual brushes: that not only reduces the amount of brushes I need but it also speeds up my morning brow makeup routine. The angled brush has soft bristles and just the right length bristles to allow control. The eye brush, the spoolie, and eyelash comb are equally great. They do exactly what they are suppose to do. I love to put on layers and layers of mascara but sometimes I might find clumping lashes. I simply used the eyelash comb while my mascara was still wet, and voala! problem solved. So far this brand has impressed me, the products are affordable and of great quality. I would definitely recommend this product! Who doesn&#x27;t love dual ended brushes especially when they come in a cute package.      I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks to try this product before my review. And I&#x27;m so glad I did.    I was very excited to be selected to review this product complementary! My brows where in need of some attention! :)    I first received my Brow and Lash Kit two days after my order was placed! ( I love Amazon Prime) I was super bummed to receive a defective Angle Brush and Spoolie. The spoolie slid right out if the brush. I contacted Crave Naturals, their costumer service was very polite they sent me a new kit took about 6 days to get to me. I&#x27;ve been using my new kit just fine for the last 3 weeks. Just yesterday the spoolie slid off the brush!!! :/ I haven&#x27;t bothered to contact costumer service again.     I&#x27;m bummed I really like liked having all the tools together packaging is adorable. The lash brush works well.</li>
    <li> Love it thought about purchasing a more expensive one and this one did thetrick saving me money!!</li>
    <li> Price is good, seller is very quick to ship. But the brushes are poor quality. The metal parts that hold the bristles simply fell off of the black handles almost immediately upon removing the brushes from the package. Granted, they didn&#x27;t cost a lot, but I expected to at least get to use them once before they broke. You get what you pay for, lesson learned.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. My wife has only had for a few days. Packaging and quality seem good.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get these. All in one (two? Lol) for traveling. However, the best part about them was going to be the angled brush part for my brows. Didn&#x27;t include that. It&#x27;s just a comb and spoolie. Kind of ridiculous honestly. It&#x27;s not even worth it to return. Oh well. Buy with caution. Photo is not what they send.</li>
    <li> Loved it!! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Ok I love this set! Shipping was so fast! I can&#x27;t wait for more products!</li>
    <li> Package is so cute. I love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for a super killer deal.. worth every penny  very handy</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I have the brow wiz from anastasia beverly hills and this thing works much better to comb the eyebrows. I usually don&#x27;t comb out my eyelashes but tried it today and it works great. Would def recommend.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cute brush set. Very stylish package box for someone who loves to put make up everyday.</li>
    <li> Great product. My brows have never looked better!</li>
    <li> This set came in the mail just as it looks in the pic and was super cute! Not over the top, quite simple necessities set. But the cylinder container is great for taking it on the go and not loosing the brushes in your bag.</li>
    <li> Great item and great price!</li>
    <li> Such a cute and functional product! The package is perfect for taking on the go and not losing your brushes!</li>
    <li> I loved the brushes! They were the perfect go-to kit to grab to do my eyes rather than take along my brush kit. The brushes were really great feeling and felt great to hold. I loved the results I got!</li>
    <li> I love the packaging. However the brush head fell off from the stick the first time I took it out from the box. Wish the quality is better.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. I brushed my eyelashes and eyebrows it was just wonderful all in one. Quality product.  I definitely recommend it in your makeup box.</li>
    <li> I love this kit! The tools really do make my eyelashes and brows look amazing! I love the eyelash brush and angled brush, thwy work so well with my lashes and brows! Thanks for such a great product!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, when received package the eyebrow brush was off of the stick and will not stay on…overall Price is good; seller is very quick to ship…But the brushes are poor quality!</li>
    <li> Packaging was great: A+&lt;br /&gt;Price was great: A+&lt;br /&gt;Idea was great: A+&lt;br /&gt;Fast Delivery: A+&lt;br /&gt;The brush was too rough it&#x27;s not the best quality and mine fell apart on the first try. I wasn&#x27;t able to glue back:  D</li>
    <li> cute little set, seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great addition to my makeup brushes</li>
    <li> I like the box and it&#x27;s easy to bring in my bag，love it ！</li>
    <li> Love how the eyebrow brush is firm yet sof!t. Great product</li>
    <li> The packaging is very cute, but the brushes are not the best quality. The ends of the brushes fell off.</li>
    <li> My go to for makeup every morning is lashes and eyebrows.. this product makes it so easy to carry around.. and the package is beautiful! highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very good sturdy products. The packaging is very classy to say the least. Nice for gifting and for personal use.</li>
    <li> I love it. super quality!</li>
    <li> I am a female. This is my husbands account lol. This is a great kit. Helps me achieve beautiful eyebrows.</li>
    <li> It is so cute, I LOVE IT!definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The packaging was cute, but as soon as I used the product it broke! I was unable to use it and I would not recommend this product. It is cheaply made. I ended up throwing it away. Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> when I opened the parcel and I found this: the head of the eyelash brush is not straight and the connection with the eyebrow brush is loose. Anyway I did not want to send it back because it&#x27;s troublesome. However, I wish Crave Naturals could put some sponge into the top and the bottom of the cylinder so it could protect the brush in the delivery. Nice cylinder.</li>
    <li> I seriously use these every single day. I don&#x27;t know how I got along without having them before! These are great quality and came in a sweet case!</li>
    <li> I love this brushes,  very good quality and very affordable</li>
    <li> Loved it so much I bought a second one.</li>
    <li> Super happy with this purchase!  Brush works as expected.  Packaging is great!  I love the attention to detail.  I am able to store my bushes in the container on my vanity.  Happy with this purchase.  I received a discount on this item.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend  as well as the crave naturals eyelash curler and she loves them! Great products for the price! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for.  Looks to be a quality product...helps with the unruly brows.  Price was great.  Arrived in 2 days as indicated with the Prime Amazon</li>
    <li> Broke after the first use.</li>
    <li> Not very happy to open it and see my angle brush broken.. just rcvd it today very excited and wuala.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. First off I am in love with the storage this product came with. It is very durable and great quality. You can actually store a few extra brushes in there if you would like. Now on to the product. I love the convenience of it being double ended. I usually would have to carry a spoolie and a brow brush separately but with this I do not that to do so. The spoolie is great for prepping my eyebrows. I love that the Angled brow brush is thin because it helps to apply powder or gel to the brow with a natural look. I also tried this with gel eyeliner and it worked really well. Also I love the eyelash comb and brush duo as well. I love that i can use this to shape my eyebrows and also make my lashes clump free by running the comb through it after applying a coat of mascara. The price is a bit pricey but the quality and convenience plus the storage  definitely makes up for it.</li>
    <li> I blogged about this wonderful product on my website. www.beautynproducts.wordpress.com&lt;br /&gt;This is what I had to say&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My love for this company is steadily increasing over their packaging alone! I am a sucker for packaging. I am guilty of buying something simply because it comes wrapped in a pretty package. Crave is so clever in their packaging it makes me want every product they have to offer.&lt;br /&gt;Guess what? Their products are just as awesome as what they come in.  Last time, I got the Whip Lash Eye Lash curler, you can read my review here. This time I received their eyebrow kit!&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two awesome tools to help me maintain my sorry excuse for eyebrows. The first tool has a comb to help me separate my clumpy ass eye lashes. Even with the best mascara you can get, it&#x27;s always a good idea to keep a tool to separate your eyelashes. No one wants to see your spider lashes!! On the other side of the comb is a little brush you can use on your lashes, or your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;The second tool, my favorite, has a mascara type applicator on one end, this applicator is great for grooming your eyebrows before you put on your makeup. It gets them looking even and neat, or to help accentuate your arch. The other end is an eyebrow makeup applicator brush. This small brush helps you apply  your eyebrow makeup with precision. I highly recommend this product! Look at the cute tube it comes in! I am saving that, I don&#x27;t know why or what I will ever use it for but I am never throwing it away :)</li>
    <li> I have never had eybrows that looked better and the product to thank for this is Crave naturals eyebrow and eyelash brush kit. it helped me seperate and brush my brows for the perfect tweezing experience. The spoolie help de clump my mascara thanks to crave naturals my eyes look better than ever thanks</li>
    <li> This handy kit is perfect every gal!  Crave Naturals stand behind all of their products and it shows!  This kit is perfect to carry in your purse for those days you need to touch up your brows and lashes.  I love the case and design of the case is amazing!  Very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This thing works better than my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow shaper. It&#x27;s the perfect size n it&#x27;s very sturdy. Please go order you one plus if you watch my YouTube channel (makeoversblissfully) I will review it because it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> This Duo Makeup kit for brows and lashes is simply the best and easy to use and a staple item for every adult female&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manicured brows in three easy steps:&lt;br /&gt;Brush&lt;br /&gt; Trim&lt;br /&gt;Tweeze</li>
    <li> Wonderful item to make your makeup application easier and your results pop. the container holds all you need to get your eyes popping from the eyelash comb making sure you have no left behind goop on your lashes to the the brow comb used to make sure your bows are on point this is the one set of tools you need to have on hand for all your eye make up needs..plus the packaging is really cute and sturdy,</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got a chance to review the Eyebrow and Eyelash Brush Kit from Crave Naturals. Every woman want to have nice looking eyelashes  and eyebrows so I was very happy to see how this product would work for me. I own other Eyebrow and Eyelash brushes that I really like, so I wanted to see if this product matched up to my current eyebrow and eyelash brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall experience with the kit is first of all I love the packaging the packaging is so nice, you can always appreciate a nice packaging. The Eyebrow and Eyelash kit was well made and very easy to use. So did this measure kit up to my current brushes? I will have to say it did, I love this kit. The kit really helped shape my eyebrows and get the clumps of mascara out of my eye lashes I love this product and will be adding it to my favorite brush sets. Thank You Crave Naturals for giving me the opportunity to review this awesome kit.</li>
    <li> Yet again Crave Naturals has another fabulous product with adorable packaging. Not only do the brow and eyelash brushes work great, they come in a fantastic little storage tube. Cute enough to make the perfect gift!</li>
    <li> I initially brought because of all the good ratings. The brush is just way to soft for me &amp; the eyebrow spookie brought off my first time using it.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need for a new eyelash/brow brush set. My kitten had eaten mine and I received this for testing purposes and I LOVE IT. I Highly recommend, it is an amazing quality, durable and reasonably priced.!</li>
    <li> Nice 4 in 1 brush comb set that comes with a cute storage container. Brushes are nice and soft that does the trick. Only thing is that the spoolie was not secured to the black wand when I opened the container. Nothing some super glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> Someone from IG shared this product with me. Just got it earlier today.  The packaging is super cute! Love the tools!  Great quality too! Exactly what I needed. I will definitely be referring family and friends!  :)</li>
    <li> The product comes like this way. I am assuming this is not the item supposes to look like. I can&#x27;t put it back due to the glue inside the brush.</li>
    <li> Love the packaging so nice and fancy and the brush is very sturdy and if you can use the eyebrow brush for gel liner. So many uses in the combo. I love it</li>
    <li> The brushes and comb are sized just right and work very well. The packaging tube is a fun addition.</li>
    <li> Use it every day! Very sturdy and durable!</li>
    <li> The brow brush is angled which is a big plus. However, I think the brush is a tad soft. Perhaps that&#x27;s a matter of personal preference but I feel a stiff brush draws a better brow. In any case, my eyebrows look great w/ the brush and the angle mascara brush is nice.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the angled brush head was broken when I opened the (very cute and sturdy) container this set came in. Quality is not the best.</li>
    <li> Super cute packaging that came super fast!</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made!!!this was shipped to me in pieces... Better quality at dollar store</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;angled&amp;#34; brush was not angled at all. And some of the brissles were abnormally longer than others. And the glue was not strong enough i guess because it feel apart and i havnt even used it yet. I have heard good things about these brushes and was excited to use them. Especially the eye brow brush. Very dissapointing when you look forward to something and cant even use it when you receive it.</li>
    <li> Great product. This kit give you all the essentials you need for your eyebrows and eyelashes, as well. Love the packaging. Cute canister. Make good for traveling.</li>
    <li> Very good product and fast shipping!!! A must buy!</li>
    <li> Great quality eyebrow kit. The little angled brush is perfect for applying gel or powder to brows. The bristle end is fantastic for combing and shaping after color is applied.</li>
    <li> Very nice set. The brush is so soft.</li>
    <li> I got this item about 3 days ago and I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am&lt;br /&gt;With this product it works amazing I will defentily be buying it once I need a new one great product and defentily don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!!</li>
    <li> Great item and seller!!@</li>
    <li> Beautiful package with all the tools we always needed.</li>
    <li> Great little set! I use these daily in my brow routine.</li>
    <li> love the packaging its so cool and unique the lash brush separates lashes really well and the brow brush apples powder well</li>
    <li> Spooly came unattached to the brush. Not a big deal or hard to repair. Used the brow brush and it&#x27;s amazing! Good quality.</li>
    <li> Very well made tools! Love it.</li>
    <li> Great tools! They are so useful applying my make up on, and the handle of the brush looked like made from real wood which is very nice detail, I love it so much. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The packaging is so cute! I love how the brush for the brow is firm and it works well with my not so thick brows. This is a great combo!</li>
    <li> I love this combo, the kit is very convenient and it comes beautifully packaged. I am glad I bought it. Thanks Michelle coupons for the heads up!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best kit I have ever owned &amp; I have been a makeup artist for 13 years now!!! This is a must-have in every woman&#x27;s makeup bag!!! HIGH QUALITY, CUTE PACKAGING, HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> This product is so cute and easy to use. I have a friend who referred this product to me and I can&#x27;t thank her enough!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this order.  The brushes are awesome!</li>
    <li> The container is so cute!&lt;br /&gt;However, the angle brush head is broken and the other side is almost broken.&lt;br /&gt;Well, not a problem to me since I just put the broken one back and adjust the other side.</li>
    <li> Lovely quality product, bristles were strong and evenly spaced for a perfect throw across lashes and brow hairs</li>
    <li> the package is so cute, adorable. Use them daily.</li>
    <li> I love these tools. They work perfectly with my Anastasia Dipbrow.</li>
    <li> fast shipping as expected. I used the products yesterday and I love it. I cannot wait to use it more often.</li>
    <li> The retro packaging is super cute but the brushes are of poor quality.  The spoolie fell off when I opened the package.  It worked fine after I glued it back.</li>
    <li> Omg so cute works great for my eye brows and getting those extra mascara clumps out!</li>
    <li> Great set! Exactly as described and it comes In the cutest packaging/storage box! Definitely worth it!!</li>
    <li> So in love with this product! The angle brush has tight bristles which is VITAL for filling in brows. I use all of these items daily and would recommend them highly. Super fast shipping too</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. The box is super cute as well. Speedy shipping. I would purchase more of these for my friends and family!</li>
    <li> The case is super cute! The brushes were not very good quality as one of the pieces fell right off after the first use. The company was however really good at contacting me and getting me a replacement. The brush is a firm bristle. So, if you prefer soft bristles i would not recommend this product. However, I have found that the firmer bristles like this one work better at drawing sharper bolder lines.</li>
    <li> Awesome packaging. Ons brush was slightly bent but will still do the job</li>
    <li> This eyebrow &amp; eyelash brush kit is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Because of the brush&#x27;s practical size, I can brush/comb my eyebrows (&amp; eyelashes) wherever I go &amp; since it came with such a cute case, I could just place it in my purse without a problem.</li>
    <li> Perfect sized tools. Not too long for my small hands. Super cute packaging.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow and eyelash brush combo kit came with cute container for great storage.  The kit works great and totally serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing I finally got around to using it and I love it. First one I ordered did come with one end off like someone showed in the picture but right away I emailed them they sent me another with no problem they replied so quick..the case it comes in its just too cute...it just works amazing and I would recommend it for sure</li>
    <li> Perfect beauty tools for the brows and the lashes! I love how easily the comb separates lashes after applying mascara and the brush keeps unruly brows in check!</li>
    <li> These come beautifully packaged! The seller also sent an awesome email with some suggestions on how to use the brushes. They do exactly what they are expected to do.</li>
    <li> Cute case, however the brushes come off easily.</li>
    <li> I like the quality of this set. very easy to use. customer service is great as well if you have any problems. would definitely recommend. would be a nice gift as well.</li>
    <li> Item was broken. The brush/comb was not attached to the handle. The angled brush is not firm enough to use for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I waited to use this product for a wedding I was attending. I tried the eyebrow and eyelash come with my Chanel products, and my eyebrows turned out nice! The brushes do not feel cheaply made and it&#x27;s definitely quality brushes that are way cheaper than my Chanel mascara and eyebrow kit. I love how the brushes came in a beautiful tube case which makes it convenient to carry other brushes when traveling. I&#x27;d definitely would purchase these brushes again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the concept of this set, everything I need for my eyes in one! I have been using these in my daily routines for a few weeks now and love how efficient they are. My only tip would be that upon using the slanted brush, the tip fell off the main attachment. I have since just super glued it back on, but I feel like it could be a tad more secure upon arrival.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love my new eyebrow and eyelash brush comb kit and would recommend it to anyone! (:</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, well worth your dollars.</li>
    <li> I really liked the spoolie in this kit, as it helped brush my brows and kept them tame. The eyelash comb wasn&#x27;t fantastic, but definitely better quality than others at the same price point. I love Crave products, but this one is not as great as their others.</li>
    <li> I am not a makeup person and I don&#x27;t have many brushes in my collection so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m an expert on brushes.  The only makeup I like to wear is eyebrow powder and eyeliner.  So when I got this kit I was excited thinking I was going to get a high quality brush.  What I got was quite the opposite. The bristles were soft and somewhat stiff, but the shape of the brush was weird.  The angle of the brush looked curvy like the shape of a Grand Piano.  I have seen pictures and it is not supposed to have that curve.  Most people&#x27;s brushes had a straight angled edged.  There were also some wonky strands that were bent out of shape.  There are some major quality control issues that apparently need to be addressed.  I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but the brush that is attached to the metal piece fell off as I took it out of the packaging.  It was easy to put back and pinch the metal to keep it somewhat in place, but you can tell it fell off.  Someone should check the brushes before they are sent out.  This is not a cheap brush and there should be better controls over the products.</li>
    <li> I purchased Crave Naturals Eyebrow and Eyelash Brush Combo and am disappointed that the eyebrow brush combo has already separated from the holder.  I have similar products that have lasted for years.  I do not recommend this product.  You can find less expensive items at a local drugstore.  I will not buy from this manufacturer again.</li>
    <li> Nice package but the brush and combs are just okay.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very useful and good quality</li>
    <li> wife received. original product had a slight defect, however was immediatley replaced. very pleased with the fast customer service received and wife was happy with usage. helps with eyebrow and mascara precision.</li>
    <li> Works well. Love the box it came in. I wouldn&#x27;t pay the original price it was listed at though.</li>
    <li> Packaging alone is super cute! Sturdy brush and works great.  Must have for beauty junkies!</li>
    <li> Great set, super cute packaging and great tools to have in my beauty kit.</li>
    <li> I like the Crave Naturals&#x27; Brow and Lash Kit because both tools are very effective in giving me defined and well-groomed brows and clump-free lashes. Both beauty tools are very easy to use and love that with these simple tools, my brows and lashes look better.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I didn&#x27;t know how much I needed these tools until I had them!  Having the tools all in two small pieces is helpful and makes it easier to use!  My favorite is the the eyelash comb!  It&#x27;s super at getting out those awful mascara clumps!  And my brows always look great!! Thanks Crave for allowing me to try out this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd product that I have purchased from Crave Naturals and I am just as excited after each one arrives. The one thing I love the most is the cute boxes that they come in. The eyelash and eyebrow kit comes in a colorful and fun container and if you plan on giving them as gifts, they are already so cute you can give as is. The other thing I like is the brushes of course. They are not fragile and the brushes don&#x27;t leave any lashes left on your skin after using them. I have had brushes that fall apart easily and this is not one of them. I feel like after using the lash brush and my lash curler. that I don&#x27;t even need eyeliner or eyeshadow anymore. These are great and I definitely recommend they to anyone who wants to change up their beauty routine without having to worry about failures.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a little girl, I have loved make-up. My mom never wore very much make-up, despite being a licensed cosmetologist, but my grandma wore lipstick every day for work. Since my parents and grandparents co-owned a duplex, Grandpa and Grandma upstairs and my family downstairs, I visited often. I remember rushing up stairs before church to visit my grandma and she would put a tiny bit of lipstick on my lips and a dab of perfume from an Avon swan shaped bottle on my small wrists. A love of cosmetics was born!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear make-up every day and love testing out new beauty products. It’s just fun for me, so of course when I had a chance to try out some new beauty tools, I jumped on it. I was given a Crave Naturals Lash and Brow Kit to use and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed about the Crave Naturals Lash and Brow Kit is that the packaging is really cute. It’s not your typical drugstore beauty product packaging, that’s for sure. Inside that package were two tools, a Lash Perfection Comb and the Duo Ended Masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lash Perfection Comb is used to unclump mascara and to separate lashes. I’ve used it every day since I got it and it works great! The Duo Ended Masterpiece has an angled brow comb and a spoolie brush on the other. I don’t fill in my brows every day, just occasionally, but I tried it out and it works, so much better than the tools I had been using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I have to say that I am pretty pleased with the Crave Naturals Lash and Brow Kit. It’s earned a permanent place in my make-up box!</li>
    <li> Great product get rid of those clumbs</li>
    <li> Works great, I carry it with me all the time and its small enough to carry in your purse. It is also super cute, would def. recommend.</li>
    <li> Works okay. One of the brushes broke while I was using it. Good for the price though.</li>
    <li> This product helped me tame &amp; shape my naturally full eyebrows! Really nice product!</li>
    <li> I think the package cost more than the product itself. Its a great way to pack an item but not for these 2 items or there should be more in the container. Products work as needed. Shipped fast</li>
    <li> I waitedn a few months to do this review to really test out the product and I have to say I love this product! My favorite tool is the brow brush, which is now my go to over my old brow brush. It is thin which allows you to balance how much product you put on the brows and the spoolie that it comes with gives your eyebrows a softer more natural look. I don&#x27;t use the eyelash comb much but its useful if you do have mascara clumps. Although the product can be a bit pricey I really do love using the product and would repurchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a super cute gift for teenage girls. I got it for my little sister and she loves it. The package is super cute and good to store it</li>
    <li> First off I love the packaging of this product because it’s super cute. It definitely keeps my lash comb and my duo ended angled brow brush and spoolie brush in a clean and safe container because now it isn’t lying around the place. This eyelash comb works amazingly in removing excess mascara to avoid spider like lashes which results in clump free, beautiful, separated lashes. There’s no excuse for sticky clumps of lashes. The eyelash comb is the tool of choice for creating a defined professional lash look. Say goodbye to spider-like lashes. This angles brow brush is used to create shape and fill in your brows to give you those defined brows you’ve been looking for. The spoolie end is used to evenly distribute and blend brow products for a natural look. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i am in love with this sweet little brow and lash kit! really got me the results i was looking for! very pretty design and fun to use! i really recommend this kit for yourself or as a sweet little gift! shaped brows are super hot right now and this kit will get you there in style! so glad i had the opportunity to test this for free for testing and review .</li>
    <li> The packaging on this product is super cute and reusable or can be used to store the eyebrow kit. It is so cute it would make a great gift. the product its self is sturdy and well made. The eyebrow brush is great for applying eyebrow powder precisely. The eyelash comb takes out clumps that mascara can leave behind. This Company sent this to me to review.</li>
    <li> Crave always has beauty products that will keep every women beautiful. I love this brow brush and eyelash set. It also comes with a cute tube to keep it safe. They are are very easy to use. It also works. It also comes with instruction for simple woman like me. I love how my eyelash curl and long. I recommend this product to everybody.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try Crave Naturals Eyebrow and Eyelash Comb Kit for free. I love the packaging! It is so cute and very sturdy. The brushes are so soft. I have used some eyebrow brushes that were so stiff that they scratched my skin. I love these brushes. This kit would make a great stocking stuffer for the make up lover in your life.</li>
    <li> Crave (The same people who sent me the Whiplash Eyelash Curler) sent me a lash and brow set to try out, so I got to play with those and learn how to use them. I have an old washed-clean mascara wand I use for this purpose, which is just fine, but does not give the full Disney princess effect. These worked great, and once you have sorted out your supermodel/Disney princess eyelashes, you can add turquoise or plum or glitter eyeliner for full effect. (And by you I mean me)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving 2 stars because my 2 piece set came in 3 pieces, aka, broken. And I have multiple friends that have also purchased this product and received 3 pieces. This tells me that the workmanship and integrity of the product was compromised in order to mass produce. Quality is definitely lacking. If I didn&#x27;t know my friend&#x27;s orders arrived broken as well, maybe I would have rated it 3 stars. However, there is a lack of presentation when you open the (very nice) packaging and find your brushes are broken from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that stood out about this product was the packaging. It was nice. They get one star for packaging, and one star for 1/2 of the order not being broken upon arrival.</li>
    <li> After spending $$$ at comestic stores  on similar products,  i have found this to be my new favorite set and more reasonable priced alternative. Not to mention great quality,  great shipping, and great customer  service. Plus, love packaging tube it comes in (great holder for brushes when you travel)</li>
    <li> The Packaging was cute. However, the eyebrow brush was off of the stick when received. Could&#x27;t put it back on because it didn&#x27;t fit unless glueing it on. It&#x27;s not worth it if buying the listing price without promotion code.</li>
    <li> Great for touch ups really love the soft brushes it have will buy from this company again</li>
    <li> Love love love that it&#x27;s a four in one product!! The brush works really well, I&#x27;ve had trouble with other brushes after I applied my mascara it still looked clumpy! The packaging that it comes in is a plus! Some days I just wanna do my eyebrows and put on mascara so I love that I can just grab and go!</li>
    <li> The packaging initially caught my eye, it&#x27;s just adorable. But, to open this and use it, I was quite pleased! It isn&#x27;t cheap quality at all. It&#x27;s very effective. No funny business with my lashes or brows. These tools are now a part of my morning ritual!</li>
    <li> Very nice brow and eyelash brushes! Came packaged in a nice tube. You know a company cares about their products when they care about their packaging! I would recommend these brushes to everyone!</li>
    <li> lovely box and product is great! Great buy.</li>
    <li> Nice brow set in cute packaging. I am wondering why it&#x27;s red and green though - looks a little Christmas-y.  like to use the hard plastic end for lashes and the spoolie for brows. You can even used the angled brush for eyeliner if you don&#x27;t need it for your brows!</li>
    <li> I received this free from winning an Instagram giveaway. These brushes were a great addition to my brow routine. I use them everyday and they help me to create the brow that I want. The service was fast and efficient. I can&#x27;t wait to see what else Crave Naturals is coming out with.</li>
    <li> My eyebrow brush was not attached to the end of the brush; I had to attach it myself. The angled brush filled in my eyebrows well. If the brush was not broken, I would have given it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> The tube it came in was very cute and definitely stands out from the rest. I liked that the brow brush was bent, it made it easier. Will definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am so embarrassed, my unit actually came broken in transit, I wanted to just return it, instead---they let me keep the broken one, refunded me...&amp; sent me a new set! That is amazing customer service, the brushes itself are great, just like their eyelash curler, it&#x27;s high quality and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the amazing customer service.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Absolutely beautiful packaging as well!</li>
    <li> love it great tool for your brush collection</li>
    <li> love these tools they are perfect!</li>
