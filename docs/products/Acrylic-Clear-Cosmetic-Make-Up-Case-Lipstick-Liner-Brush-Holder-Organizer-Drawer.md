      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>lipstick fit perfectly</li>
      <li>Looks good and does the job</li>
      <li>So, I knew what I was buying, but don&#x27;t expect it to look as good as Home-it acrylic or US Acrylic.</li>
      <li>Amazing for organizing your makeup in one place</li>
      <li>nice size</li>
      <li>Love this product, it&#x27;s nice and sturdy.</li>
      <li>Just sent off for it, so I haven&#x27;t gotten it yet, but I know I will love it</li>
      <li>Love it all&lt;</li>
      <li>I was hoping that it would be safe since it was well packaged, however it was not.</li>
      <li>They should probably have it packed better.</li>
      <li>love THIS</li>
      <li>but I still love it regardless:)</li>
      <li>and i love how its not all one level</li>
      <li>I would have paid more for a nicer, newer one if I knew what I would be receiving.</li>
      <li>I am thinking abt getting more lipsticks/ lip glosses..</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s tiered.</li>
      <li>Pretty good quality.</li>
      <li>Super nice product</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure if this hadn&#x27;t happened then i would totally enjoy my purchase.</li>
      <li>Its not heavy duty acrylic, but  it does work great with MAC lipsticks.</li>
      <li>Holds my lipsticks just fine.</li>
      <li>Fits the majority of my lipsticks fine.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still fine.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold some lipstick tubes though, like Flower by Drew Berrymoore, but any drugstore lipstick has fit in just fine for me.</li>
      <li>It looks as cheap as it costs, but I have dozens of  perfume vials and needed something for holding them organized inside my perfume drawer.</li>
      <li>quality is ok, worth the price.</li>
      <li>great price,minor corner damage and came with extra padding and foam</li>
      <li>Other wise I love it!</li>
      <li>Very useful I like would reccomend</li>
      <li>Spaces are great for organizing bit limited to what they can hold.</li>
      <li>Good for standard sized lipsticks.</li>
      <li>Overall, pretty good.</li>
      <li>does exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
      <li>To be honest, I was concerned that the compartments wouldn&#x27;t be deep or wide enough and they turned out to be perfect.</li>
      <li>Would be nice to have deeper holes in the back for longer tubes of lipgloss.</li>
      <li>Durable and worth the money</li>
      <li>when I first saw this out of the package I thought &amp;#34;oh no too small&amp;#34; but it actually fit like 20 different size brushes and has room for lots more.</li>
      <li>But basically, it does the job and comes right away and has a sturdy design</li>
      <li>Quality Product, Looks so Pretty,  </li>
      <li>Will be buying more in the future.</li>
      <li>I love it will definitely buy another two for my collection!!!!</li>
      <li>but I actually like it more because of it.</li>
      <li>Love it just wish they had bigger sizes.</li>
      <li>It fits pretty much every style lipstick that i have.</li>
      <li>Really sturdy plastic, too.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really.</li>
      <li>This was worth my purchase,the only think is I wish the boxes were a little more deep.</li>
      <li>Acrylic Clear Cosmetic Make Up Case Lipstick Liner Brush Holder Organizer...  </li>
      <li>Came a week or too early.</li>
      <li>I think it is likely to stand up to my usual lipstick wear and tear, though I dont know how well it would work for more heavy-duty tasks.</li>
      <li>I really like it, smaller than I expected</li>

<li> Came a week or too early.</li>
<li> I think it is likely to stand up to my usual lipstick wear and tear, though I dont know how well it would work for more heavy-duty tasks.</li>
<li> I really like it, smaller than I expected</li>
<li> and you can actually see by the pictures that it&#x27;s the flimsy kind of acrylic with a bad finish.</li>
<li> Shipping was long though</li>
<li> cuz it&#x27;s so long.</li>
<li> But that&#x27;s not much of an issue.</li>
<li> This product is as expected.</li>
<li> I have zero complaints about this other than the fact that it arrived with a bottom corner completely broken off and no broken piece in the package...which means it was packaged and sent to me like this.</li>
<li> Fits all my mac lipsticks but doesn&#x27;t fit other brands such as L&#x27;oreal. :(</li>
<li> No worth buying.</li>
<li> I have a byAlegory one that&#x27;s flat, and it sucks trying to find space for it</li>
<li> The exterior sides were scratched and not smooth whatsoever.</li>
<li> This came in after a month and a half!</li>
<li> it also looks fancy with my makeup lazy susan.</li>
<li> I was not delighted with it at all</li>
<li> Came cracked and broken fragil</li>
<li> It was broken/chipped on one side which has a (broken) line going through the underside :( .</li>
<li> My lipstick holder organizer arrived cracked from the sides which was disappointing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Perfect size and so cute</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s tiered. I have a byAlegory one that&#x27;s flat, and it sucks trying to find space for it cuz it&#x27;s so long. Will probably buy another and return the byAlegory one</li>
    <li> Good for standard sized lipsticks. That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> So, basically this lipstick holder is of poor quality, but it still gets 4 stars because it was cheap, arrived in one piece and you can actually see by the pictures that it&#x27;s the flimsy kind of acrylic with a bad finish. So, I knew what I was buying, but don&#x27;t expect it to look as good as Home-it acrylic or US Acrylic. It looks as cheap as it costs, but I have dozens of  perfume vials and needed something for holding them organized inside my perfume drawer. It does the job.</li>
    <li> I love it will definitely buy another two for my collection!!!!</li>
    <li> Fits the majority of my lipsticks fine.</li>
    <li> Very good May have to order another acrylic box.my lipstick collection is growing but it&#x27;s really. Durable and worth the money</li>
    <li> My lipstick holder organizer arrived cracked from the sides which was disappointing. I was hoping that it would be safe since it was well packaged, however it was not. My lipstick organizer arrived all scratched up with different marks and seemed somewhat used. I was not delighted with it at all but I kept it because I truly needed it for my lipsticks. I would have paid more for a nicer, newer one if I knew what I would be receiving.</li>
    <li> Love it just wish they had bigger sizes. Fits all my mac lipsticks but doesn&#x27;t fit other brands such as L&#x27;oreal. :( Other wise I love it!</li>
    <li> nice size and i love how its not all one level so it makes its easier when picking out a lipstick!!!</li>
    <li> Acrylic Clear Cosmetic Make Up Case Lipstick Liner Brush Holder Organizer...  Quality Product, Looks so Pretty,  my Lip Gloss looks so Organized.</li>
    <li> Good quality. I thought it would look bigger but it&#x27;s still fine. Holds my lipsticks just fine. Also great price.</li>
    <li> quality is ok, worth the price. Its not heavy duty acrylic, but  it does work great with MAC lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Looks good and does the job</li>
    <li> I have zero complaints about this other than the fact that it arrived with a bottom corner completely broken off and no broken piece in the package...which means it was packaged and sent to me like this. I&#x27;m disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure if this hadn&#x27;t happened then i would totally enjoy my purchase.</li>
    <li> Spaces are great for organizing bit limited to what they can hold.</li>
    <li> This came in after a month and a half! It was broken/chipped on one side which has a (broken) line going through the underside :( . They should probably have it packed better. No worth buying. Id say go and find in marshalls or ross. They have the same price</li>
    <li> when I first saw this out of the package I thought &amp;#34;oh no too small&amp;#34; but it actually fit like 20 different size brushes and has room for lots more.This was worth my purchase,the only think is I wish the boxes were a little more deep.But that&#x27;s not much of an issue.GET THIS!</li>
    <li> Came cracked and broken fragil</li>
    <li> Very useful I like would reccomend</li>
    <li> I really like it, smaller than I expected but I actually like it more because of it. It fits pretty much every style lipstick that i have. Came a week or too early. Thinking about ordering another one.</li>
    <li> it fits all of my lipsticks its awesomeness! and it holds a lot of lipsticks. it is the perfect size.</li>
    <li> It was quite damaged. The exterior sides were scratched and not smooth whatsoever. I had bought this profit before and it doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> The shipping took about 3-4 weeks but I still love it regardless:)</li>
    <li> great price,minor corner damage and came with extra padding and foam</li>
    <li> very good ! I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love it all&lt;br /&gt;My lipstick fit perfectly</li>
    <li> Just sent off for it, so I haven&#x27;t gotten it yet, but I know I will love it</li>
    <li> Awesome value. I researched prices for this item and ended up buying 2 of these. To be honest, I was concerned that the compartments wouldn&#x27;t be deep or wide enough and they turned out to be perfect.</li>
    <li> Love !! love!!!! love THIS I am thinking abt getting more lipsticks/ lip glosses..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks great makes my room look like a show room</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best out there, but it is a good price, came without any kids of cracks or defects, and looks nice. I think it is likely to stand up to my usual lipstick wear and tear, though I dont know how well it would work for more heavy-duty tasks. Overall, pretty good.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve put almost everything in this holder: from lip crayons to lipsticks and mascaras and eyeliners. Amazing for organizing your makeup in one place</li>
    <li> Great price and does exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to do! Doesn&#x27;t hold some lipstick tubes though, like Flower by Drew Berrymoore, but any drugstore lipstick has fit in just fine for me. Really sturdy plastic, too.</li>
    <li> As a girl who likes to look like Barbie I have a lot of lipstick!!! and this was greatly needed. it also looks fancy with my makeup lazy susan.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Ordered 3 two for myself and one as a gift for my sister!</li>
    <li> Love mine!! Super nice product</li>
    <li> This is not lipstick. It is a lipstick HOLDER.</li>
    <li> The holes are all the same depth. Would be nice to have deeper holes in the back for longer tubes of lipgloss. But basically, it does the job and comes right away and has a sturdy design</li>
    <li> This product is as expected. Very good quality, but not the best. For the price it is awesome!</li>
    <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s nice and sturdy. Will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Shipping was long though</li>
