      <li>This is the perfect little gift for you or a friend.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos and Fekkai is by far one of the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>This has greatly improved the quality of my hair and I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on it which never happened before.</li>
      <li>Enjoy using all of Fekkai products</li>
      <li>I was excited to try the hairspray, I like the product</li>
      <li>The really good thing in my opinion- was there was a TEN dollar coupon in it, so</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner leave even the finest of hair full of volume and bounce.</li>
      <li>The hairspray holds great without weighing the hair down.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, and the hairspray was pretty nice as well- held well but not too heavy.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Love the small bottles for travel, I have always liked the shampoo and conditioner, great for thin fine hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine, and I am over 50; this shampoo has just the right balance between soft and provides a bit of density.</li>
      <li>Fekkai products are top quality and these trial sizes will last longer than you can believe.</li>
      <li>Very pleasantly surprised by all three products, will buy full size.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much difference for my hair, and at the price point I wont be buying it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting older and my hair is turning gray and falling out.</li>
      <li>Wish more companies would offer small sizes.  </li>
      <li>Unless you have very hard water and no water softener, use just a small amount of the shampoo and conditioner to get perfect results.  </li>
      <li>The only real downside is the cost</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it made it very limp.</li>
      <li>The size is such that you can use it for about a week straight, which is enough to determine if its for you.  </li>
      <li>have heavy but thin and flat hair, looks great.</li>

    <li> Holy cow the hairspray stinks so bad I want to gag.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product! It&#x27;s wonderful and great on the hair. I would order it again in the future too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos and Fekkai is by far one of the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. I&#x27;m getting older and my hair is turning gray and falling out. Bummer. So I dye it and I need volume but conditioning. This has greatly improved the quality of my hair and I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on it which never happened before. The smell is okay, not my favorite. The only real downside is the cost but it&#x27;s worth it. If my hair looks amazing I&#x27;m hooked regardless.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect little gift for you or a friend.  Fekkai products are top quality and these trial sizes will last longer than you can believe.

    <li> This is a wonderful sample kit to try some of the Fekkai products.</li>
    <li> I have used Fekkai products for years now. I purchased this volume kit for a trip via an airplane. Just prefect.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo and conditioner at all. I have fine hair and it made it very limp.</li>
    <li> Fekkai hair products are great; this is perfect for travel needs.</li>
    <li> Did not like at all, have never seen such watery conditioner. Blowed that $13.00.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is awesome makes your hair feel like silk.</li>
    <li> Have loved this shampoo for a while; really happy to find a size that I can take to the gym. :-) Wish more companies would offer small sizes.  My hair is fine, and I am over 50; this shampoo has just the right balance between soft and provides a bit of density. Yes, it is expensive-but it is one of my few necessary luxuries.
