      <li>and it turns out beautiful !!  </li>
      <li>Perfect curls, smells nice, shiny and it&#x27;s not crunchy at ALL !!</li>
      <li>This controls the fly away frizzes in the morning after I get up.  </li>
      <li>Cannot express how much I love this product!!</li>
      <li>I would say buy it because you will love the outcome!!</li>
      <li>LOVE this !!  </li>
      <li>Not as good as the hair yogurt they have,</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair and this didn&#x27;t work for my frizz but did make my hair smell really good.</li>
      <li>They smell great and work even better.</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty awesome</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>if you have curly hair, buy this, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>Smells super good.</li>
      <li>I really love this product-</li>
      <li>but I am so glad that Amazon has it to purchase.</li>
      <li>This is such an awesome product.  </li>
      <li>I prefer them tighter and more defined, so I will stick to the Argan curl cream.</li>
      <li>The smell is lovely, too.</li>
      <li>I like it better than the argon oil curl cream.</li>
      <li>Works great alone, but even better with John Frieda Sheer Solution.</li>
      <li>but when you combine the two, it makes my hair look fantastic and shiny.</li>
      <li>This one smells so beautiful and applies nicely, but it: 1) Doesn&#x27;t last the whole day for me like the Argan cream, and 2) Doesn&#x27;t give a highly defined curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But if you want loose, smooth curls and a nice smell, go for it!</li>
      <li>This stuff smells fantastic and for my fine curly hair it really helps calm the frizz.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth trying if you have issues with fuzzy locks or unruly curls.</li>
      <li>but, I mix this with a bit of conditioner on wet hair and my hair is smooth, soft and very healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try it because I love OGX defining curl cream in the blue bottle, the Argan Oil line.</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t be buying it again, as it is pricier than my preferred product and less effective.</li>
      <li>Who wants to touch that ?  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sticky, I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s alright doesn&#x27;t really help with my curls</li>
      <li>I just scrunch it into my damp hair and let it air dry, and it makes my normally mixed 2c/3a curly hair perfect ringlets, with very little frizz.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had thick, fine textured long hair most of my life.</li>
      <li>This is my &#x27;go to&#x27; cream for my naturally curly hair when the humidity hits!  </li>
      <li>The affect is a soft, touchable curl without frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair that I do nothing to.</li>
      <li>Having naturally curly hair, which is also 40% gray</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t define my curls but it does make my hair feel extremely soft and controls frizz</li>
      <li>product can feel sticky if you put too much in your hair, and look oily when dry.</li>

<li> that&#x27;s color treated, it can be a small miracle to find a combination of products that work well to cut down the &#x27;frizz&#x27;.  </li>
<li> I find I need very little to achieve a controlled, non-frizzy curly look when my hair is air dried using this on damp hair.  </li>
<li> and I wondered if this might be a less expensive alternative.</li>
<li> It has a very subtle smell which I like because it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
<li> I hate crunchy hair.</li>
<li> This stuff is awful.</li>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright doesn&#x27;t really help with my curls</li>
    <li> LOVE this !!  I have naturally curly hair that I do nothing to. I wash with WEN, just a dab of this oil and it turns out beautiful !!  Perfect curls, smells nice, shiny and it&#x27;s not crunchy at ALL !! I hate crunchy hair. Who wants to touch that ?  Easiest way to style my hair ever !  I have been a hairdresser for 30 years and I would not want to be without this oil or my WEN !</li>
    <li> This controls the fly away frizzes in the morning after I get up.  I use it on my dry hair, sparingly.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and this didn&#x27;t work for my frizz but did make my hair smell really good.</li>
    <li> Made my hair sticky and looked greasy. Didn&#x27;t help with frizz.</li>
    <li> My wavy hair loves this, but I get it at Walmart for under six dollars!!!</li>
    <li> if you have curly hair, buy this, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> I really love this product- I just scrunch it into my damp hair and let it air dry, and it makes my normally mixed 2c/3a curly hair perfect ringlets, with very little frizz. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how well this works for frizzy curly hair. Just a dab will do you. Finally a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt; rob me of my hair coloring.</li>
    <li> Made my curls look shiny and defined. Smells super good. I like it better than the argon oil curl cream.</li>
    <li> Works great alone, but even better with John Frieda Sheer Solution. This stuff is pretty awesome but when you combine the two, it makes my hair look fantastic and shiny. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This curl defying cream worked wonders for my tresses.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair look absolutley great!!If you haven&#x27;t ried it I would say buy it because you will love the outcome!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t define my curls but it does make my hair feel extremely soft and controls frizz well. It has a very subtle smell which I like because it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful. It&#x27;s very sticky, I don&#x27;t like the smell and it left my hair frizzy when it dried. I&#x27;ve had thick, fine textured long hair most of my life. I bought this because I like a line of products by L&#x27; anza long hair care which uses Kukui nut and I wondered if this might be a less expensive alternative. IT&#x27;S NOT. You get what you pay for people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor: Get some L&#x27;anza products instead. Especially their Trauma Treatment which just shames this product. They smell great and work even better.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells fantastic and for my fine curly hair it really helps calm the frizz.</li>
    <li> This is my &#x27;go to&#x27; cream for my naturally curly hair when the humidity hits!  I also like the oil but, I mix this with a bit of conditioner on wet hair and my hair is smooth, soft and very healthy looking.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the hair yogurt they have, but I use this product daily and I love it!</li>
    <li> Cannot express how much I love this product!! My hair went from a frizzy rat&#x27;s nest to soft curls with absolutely no oiliness or sticky residue. I like to use it on towel dried hair and also as maintenance for styled dry hair. The smell is lovely, too. Tropical but not overpowering. Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Having naturally curly hair, which is also 40% gray that&#x27;s color treated, it can be a small miracle to find a combination of products that work well to cut down the &#x27;frizz&#x27;.  This product in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner by the same name, works well. If I change the shampoo or conditioner; using some other types, this product is not as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can feel sticky if you put too much in your hair, and look oily when dry. I find I need very little to achieve a controlled, non-frizzy curly look when my hair is air dried using this on damp hair.  The affect is a soft, touchable curl without frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth trying if you have issues with fuzzy locks or unruly curls.</li>
    <li> This is such an awesome product.  I wish I could find it in the store but I am so glad that Amazon has it to purchase. I even use it on my toddler&#x27;s hair. It makes her curls pop and it isn&#x27;t heavy or harsh.</li>
    <li> I decided to try it because I love OGX defining curl cream in the blue bottle, the Argan Oil line. With this product, my curls dry looser and &amp;#34;beachier&amp;#34;. I prefer them tighter and more defined, so I will stick to the Argan curl cream. This one smells so beautiful and applies nicely, but it: 1) Doesn&#x27;t last the whole day for me like the Argan cream, and 2) Doesn&#x27;t give a highly defined curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying it again, as it is pricier than my preferred product and less effective. But if you want loose, smooth curls and a nice smell, go for it!</li>
