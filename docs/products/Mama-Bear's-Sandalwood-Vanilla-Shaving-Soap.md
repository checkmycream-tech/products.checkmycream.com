      <li>Unbelieveably good good good stuff!!!!!</li>
      <li>The scent is wonderful--we both love the smell!!  </li>
      <li>I had heard that Mama Bear makes a really good soap, but I had been using Proraso and Cella and delayed buying it.</li>
      <li>The best part, and most important probably, is the shave quality.</li>
      <li>Now looking at more scents from Mama Bear&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>but when I do, I&#x27;ll make sure and use this soap!</li>
      <li>It was extremely easy to get great lather.</li>
      <li>The large size fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>This soap also lathers nicely.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrance.  </li>
      <li>(Kind of like Brut meets vanilla)</li>
      <li>This is a nicely scented glycerin shave soap.</li>
      <li>Nice rich lather and the smell is great.</li>
      <li>Very easy to work up a lather</li>
      <li>Best shaving soap I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
      <li>I thought $9.99 was a reasonable price, &amp; my husband was happy with his BD gift.  </li>
      <li>and this just lathers better and provide a better shaving experience.  </li>
      <li>all of these soaps are top notch-</li>
      <li>This soap is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I agree it&#x27;s OK, and I like it, but it is not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I can tell just by how easy it lathers</li>
      <li>Strongly scented, smells just as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Still a decent soap with ok lather and a nice aroma.</li>
      <li>, I thought I was doing just fine.    </li>
      <li>AND this puck is HUGE.</li>
      <li>and it leaves your skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
      <li>The scent is fantastic.</li>
      <li>What a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrance and makes a decent lather.  </li>
      <li>It provides an excellent lather and a slick shave.</li>
      <li>I had no idea shaving could be this much slicker and more comfortable</li>
      <li>smell is more talc than vanilla, but still masculine and very clean.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite soap.</li>
      <li>I have tried close to 40 different creams, soaps, sticks and oils and this one is not even good.</li>
      <li>But here is the cool thing</li>
      <li>My husband has been using it about once per week for 3 months now and the tub is still almost full.  </li>
      <li>quick with no issues.</li>
      <li>When I first started using a safety razor this was my first soap based on reviews, but since then have found better.  </li>
      <li>Not a thick lather but more than their cedarwood and lemon</li>
      <li>The former lathers very easily and the latter takes some determination but the results for each are superior.</li>
      <li>One thing to remember if you are not used to using glycerin soaps, they typically require more water than other soaps to get the best quality lather.  </li>
      <li>Nice choice of scents but in terms of shaveability no big deal for lathering, glide, lubrication, closeness of shave, freedom from nicks and irritation and how it leaves your face afterwards.</li>
      <li>That should be fun to watch</li>
      <li>But, the soap produced a nice later</li>
      <li>Not too powerful a smell</li>
      <li>Far better than the so-called   designer soaps.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is not over whelming, just right.</li>
      <li>My husband creates the lather right in the plastic tub.  </li>
      <li>Really, guys, nothing special.</li>
      <li>, you need a little bit more  water on your brush to really get it to lather up nicely.</li>
      <li>Left my skin feeling very smooth after the shave.</li>
      <li>Just used this for the first time.</li>
      <li>is my first time using a shaving soap</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a DE first timer, and look forward to using this soap every morning.  </li>
      <li>My husband wasn&#x27;t exactly enthused by the idea of smelling like pot all day.</li>
      <li>It may look pricey at first</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used it and have a couple of comments.  </li>
      <li>do not know how this shaving soap compares to others, but it is way better than traditional shaving cream.</li>
      <li>This product came a day sooner than it was supposed to (first time ever for a product!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves skin smooth and it lathers up quick, I like the smell as well as upper management (wife).</li>
      <li>The smell is very strong, but a little on the powdery side, this might be the vanilla, but I was looking for smell that was a bit more masculine.</li>
      <li>Definitely would make a great gift for someone who enjoys a wet shave.</li>
      <li>It makes a  thick lather and is overall a very wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to Mama Bear&#x27;s soaps!</li>
      <li>I bought this based on positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>I was very dissatisfied with my over all experience in buying shave soap from mama bear.</li>
      <li>The only downside to ordering these products online is that you don&#x27;t know if the scent will be something you&#x27;ll enjoy.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really matter which fragrance you</li>
      <li>I shave with a straight razor but even if you use a disposable (shame)</li>
      <li>I just never gave shaving soaps much thought.    </li>
      <li>I just ordered a tub for my grandson whose decided he wants to learn to use a straight razor.  </li>
      <li>This is my go too shaving soap, none others really compare to it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use a straight razor as much as I used to</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether or not I&#x27;d buy again, simply because you can&#x27;t smell them before you buy, but it gets the job done nicely.</li>
      <li>The soap itself gets a good lather and lets me shave without irritation and a single package goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>This is so much better than the other soaps I have tried.  </li>
      <li>If you know that you like this sort of scent from other products, though, you have a safe bet with this one.</li>
      <li>&quot; that smells exactly like Old Spice after shave.</li>
      <li>Ok UPDATE time, 12.9.2014, its been about a year and a half of using this shave soap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m considerably older than 17 but one tub has lasted well over a year before I needed to order another.</li>
      <li>Lathers up nicely with a brush, clean, noticeable scent that&#x27;s not overpowering, very little irritation or drying, plays nice with my Shave Secret or American Crew preshave oils.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the long lasting smell!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The soap makes a thick, rich lather that is very slick and does a great job of protecting the face.   </li>
      <li>So I just got my new tub of mama bear&#x27;s shave soap.  </li>
      <li>I live in Wisconsin&#x27;s Northwoods.  </li>
      <li>What I don&#x27;t like is that it dries out on your face too quickle and you have to re-soap each side and front of face each time you move to a new area of your face.</li>

    <li> This is my go too shaving soap, none others really compare to it.  I have Colonel Conks etc and this just lathers better and provide a better shaving experience.  AND this puck is HUGE. at least twice the size of others.      Ok UPDATE time, 12.9.2014, its been about a year and a half of using this shave soap. Now I just lather up in the shower and it handles well... But here is the cool thing, This soap is a MONEY SAVER! It may look pricey at first but I have barely dented this puck in the last 18 months of use. I seriously dont think Ill need another puck until my unborn son is shaving at this rate. Granted I do not shave every day. Skin is always soft after as well, wife loves the smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shaving soap. Not too powerful a smell but boy does it lubricate the skin. I don&#x27;t use a straight razor as much as I used to but when I do, I&#x27;ll make sure and use this soap!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mama Bear&#x27;s shaving soaps for several years and have several of her fragrances on hand, my personal favorite is Bay Rum.  I shave with a straight razor but even if you use a disposable (shame) you will notice a smoother, closer shave.  Unlike the stuff in a can sold at the grocery store, there are no harsh chemicals to abuse your skin.  I just ordered a tub for my grandson whose decided he wants to learn to use a straight razor.  That should be fun to watch but at 17 one tub should last him until he is 21!!  On that note, the soap does last for quite a while.  I&#x27;m considerably older than 17 but one tub has lasted well over a year before I needed to order another.</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time. It was extremely easy to get great lather. Left my skin feeling very smooth after the shave. The scent is wonderful, makes you feel just downright happy after you&#x27;ve shaved.</li>
    <li> Strongly scented, smells just as advertised.  But the lather, wetness and lubricating qualities of  all of her soaps are the best I have ever used.  Far better than the so-called   designer soaps.  Try one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had heard that Mama Bear makes a really good soap, but I had been using Proraso and Cella and delayed buying it. I wish I hadn&#x27;t. This is my absolute favorite soap. The scent is fantastic. The best part, and most important probably, is the shave quality. The soap makes a thick, rich lather that is very slick and does a great job of protecting the face.   One thing to remember if you are not used to using glycerin soaps, they typically require more water than other soaps to get the best quality lather.  Give this soap a try. Your face will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> Unbelieveably good good good stuff!!!!! Choses the flavor or fragrance you prefer- all of Mama Bear&#x27;s soaps are just the best there is.  Personally- I like the Northwoods pine fragrance the best- but I am biased- I live in Wisconsin&#x27;s Northwoods.  Doesn&#x27;t really matter which fragrance you prefer- all of these soaps are top notch- extremely well made- with terriffic ingredients and they last forever.  Buy this soap if you are a wet shaver- you will be hooked!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving soap I have used. I put it in an old soup cup that I found at Salvation Army Store for $.50. The large size fits perfectly. Just a few swishes of the hot wet shaving brush and thats all it needs. The fragrance is not over whelming, just right. I like Sandalwood Vanilla the best. Have not tried Patchouli Essential Oil yet.</li>
    <li> I ordered  shave soap from mama bear for my husband and when we received it, it was the wrong  soap.. It was cannabis scented. My husband wasn&#x27;t exactly enthused by the idea of smelling like pot all day. Despite several attempts to contact mama bear soaps we received no responses. After reading rave reviews on badger and blade I was very dissatisfied with my over all experience in buying shave soap from mama bear.</li>
    <li> Great lather, great scent.  I&#x27;m a DE first timer, and look forward to using this soap every morning.  Now looking at more scents from Mama Bear&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the other soaps I have tried.  It makes a  thick lather and is overall a very wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to Mama Bear&#x27;s soaps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mama Bear shave soap for a few years now.  The soap itself gets a good lather and lets me shave without irritation and a single package goes a long way.  The sandalwood vanilla scent is a simple, classic sort of masculine scent that keeps my wife cozying up to me whenever I shave.  The only downside to ordering these products online is that you don&#x27;t know if the scent will be something you&#x27;ll enjoy.  If you know that you like this sort of scent from other products, though, you have a safe bet with this one.</li>
    <li> When I first started using a safety razor this was my first soap based on reviews, but since then have found better.  Still a decent soap with ok lather and a nice aroma.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent soap. It provides an excellent lather and a slick shave. My only problem with the soap (which explains the 3/5 stars) is that it&#x27;s sightly too scented for my taste. If you enjoy a heavily scented shave soap, this is definitely for you. Aside from that, it&#x27;s an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Wow! I &#x27;graduated&#x27; from Williams to what I thought were premium soaps like Van Der Hagen and Col. Conk&#x27;s. All of those are just dandy and will get the job done. But this was a quantum leap forward I would not have thought possible. I just never gave shaving soaps much thought.    Some folks have trouble getting glycerin soaps to lather, but use a lot of product and keep adding water and work it for about two minutes and you will have a lather that will just blow you away! I had no idea shaving could be this much slicker and more comfortable, I thought I was doing just fine.    I there is a video on Mama Bear&#x27;s home page showing how it lathers. Check it out. I doubt I can put a link in here for security reasons, just Google it.    I just found out she makes an \\&quot;Old Spice\\&quot; that smells exactly like Old Spice after shave. I have to try that next! Buy this. You will be tossing the remains of your old soap away after one shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on positive reviews.  I agree it&#x27;s OK, and I like it, but it is not my favorite.  It has a nice fragrance and makes a decent lather.  Had I not used Taylor of Bond street, I would consider this the best on the market.</li>
    <li> Mamas bear sandlewood shave soap is a Great product!!! Love the long lasting smell!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be trying some other fragrances of this shave soap!</li>
    <li> It will last a long time as it is hard soap; but lathers well. What I don&#x27;t like is that it dries out on your face too quickle and you have to re-soap each side and front of face each time you move to a new area of your face.</li>
    <li> Lathers up nicely with a brush, clean, noticeable scent that&#x27;s not overpowering, very little irritation or drying, plays nice with my Shave Secret or American Crew preshave oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is more talc than vanilla, but still masculine and very clean.</li>
    <li> This product came a day sooner than it was supposed to (first time ever for a product!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using a shaving soap so my experience is limited. But, the soap produced a nice later that was way less foamy than traditional bottled shaving cream. The later was also much more slick than traditional shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a nice, subtle smell. If someone gets close to your face then they may get a whiff of it, otherwise you&#x27;ll be the only one that knows its there (I use an odorless lotion after shaving.) In my opinion it has the perfect strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how this shaving soap compares to others, but it is way better than traditional shaving cream. Give it a try if you want to get serious about shaving!</li>
    <li> I had already tried the menthol soap.  I saw this vanilla one and decided to give it a try.  It leaves skin smooth and it lathers up quick, I like the smell as well as upper management (wife).</li>
    <li> Best shaving soap I&#x27;ve used by far. Nice rich lather and the smell is great.</li>
    <li> After doing some research and reading reviews for shaving soap, I bought my husband a tub of Mama Bear&#x27;s Sandalwood Vanilla shave soap.  I thought $9.99 was a reasonable price, &amp; my husband was happy with his BD gift.  My husband is not one to moisturize his face after shaving, but he said this soap leaves his skin feeling soft and moisturized.  The scent is wonderful--we both love the smell!!  It&#x27;s a masculine, earthy scent, but NOT an overpowering scent that would interfere with colognes or after shave.    This soap also lathers nicely.  My husband creates the lather right in the plastic tub.  It lasts a LONG time as well.  My husband has been using it about once per week for 3 months now and the tub is still almost full.  It&#x27;s down about 1/4\\&quot; from the rim of the tub.  If you&#x27;re not a fan of the sandalwood vanilla scent, then check out Mama Bear&#x27;s Soaps website.  They have lots of other shave soaps to choose from, a shave soap demonstration, and other products.  The best part is this soap is made in the USA (Florence, WI)!!  We both like buying products made in the US.  [...]</li>
    <li> This soap is fantastic! What a smooth, comfortable shave. Very easy to work up a lather and it leaves your skin hydrated and smooth. The blade just glides across your face and you can make several passes just by re-wetting the razor. I can tell just by how easy it lathers the cake is going to last for a very long time. I just might buy several other scents just to try something different every now and then. The only down side for me was that the cake was bigger in diameter than my mug so I had to find a small bowl.</li>
    <li> So I just got my new tub of mama bear&#x27;s shave soap.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used it and have a couple of comments.  The smell is very strong, but a little on the powdery side, this might be the vanilla, but I was looking for smell that was a bit more masculine. (Kind of like Brut meets vanilla) The smell lasts for a long time though which I like. As far as making a lather, it does this quite well, you need a little bit more  water on your brush to really get it to lather up nicely. Overall I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether or not I&#x27;d buy again, simply because you can&#x27;t smell them before you buy, but it gets the job done nicely. Definitely would make a great gift for someone who enjoys a wet shave.</li>
    <li> This is a nicely scented glycerin shave soap. IMHO very similar to any other glycerin soap you might try from Col. Conk or Ven Derhagen or any body else. Nice choice of scents but in terms of shaveability no big deal for lathering, glide, lubrication, closeness of shave, freedom from nicks and irritation and how it leaves your face afterwards. Really, guys, nothing special. I have tried close to 40 different creams, soaps, sticks and oils and this one is not even good. What do I prefer you ask? I am still unable to resolve a single absolute winner between the final two finalists. And those two are: Kiss My Face (lime) and the newcomer Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap. The former lathers very easily and the latter takes some determination but the results for each are superior. Every other product, regardless of price or reputation, can go home.</li>
    <li> Not a thick lather but more than their cedarwood and lemon flavor.&lt;br /&gt;Very fragrant, lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quick with no issues.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous different shaving soaps.  This is pretty good.  It lathers well.  It has a nice fragrance.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
