      <li>They also smell amazing: I immediately thought of Granny Smith apples when I opened the package.</li>
      <li>but this remover is amazing all by itself.  </li>
      <li>It is nice that they  are on the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; side too.</li>
      <li>I have read and heard from all sorts of health sources that one must rinse after any kind of wipe</li>
      <li>just OKAY, 4 stars is supposed to be &#x27;liked it&#x27; and 5 stars is supposed to be &#x27;loved it&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>It is not that kind of product.  </li>
      <li>They are handy and convenient for use at home but also to pack when traveling.</li>
      <li>All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
      <li>I love Netrogena in particular, but these wipes are especially great.</li>
      <li>The wipes also smell great and are very gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They have a very light fruity fragrance and leave no film after use.  </li>
      <li>I love any neutrogena product, I can trust the name.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I received this as a free sample from Crowdtap &amp; Neutrogena® Naturals to try, review, and supply my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>These are the best facial cleaning wipes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>So, these wipes were just okay.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use make up, but this is a refreshing face wipe even for a guy.  </li>
      <li>Do you like to scrub your face for more than 4 minutes?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to buy over and over.</li>
      <li>ok if you so desire.  </li>
      <li>And they cost more than most.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll probably end up purchasing more of these packs.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
      <li>I cannot reccomend more the No. 7 brand make up remover wipes.</li>
      <li>I think a product like this would most often be used if one was traveling and wanted to freshen up.  </li>
      <li>I have found the Neutrogena line of Naturals to be a lot better for my skin.</li>
      <li>I love these wipes.</li>
      <li>I have fallen in love woth these wipes.</li>
      <li>but I am glad to see that Neutrogena is trying to be more eco-friendly.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this product, because Neutrogena is a brand I know and trust.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They seem to have a nice, clean scent and are supposed to remove all dirt, oil and makeup without leaving greasy residue.  </li>
      <li>And most importantly do you like your face and eyes to feel like it got acid burns?</li>
      <li>have always used baby wipes to wipe my make up off, but sometimes I do not use the right kind for my face.</li>
      <li>I have yet to find wipes that actually truely do!</li>
      <li>They take off all other makeup perfectly but mascara is always the tricky part.</li>
      <li>but like I said lack the ability to easily and fully remove mascara.</li>
      <li>They work better then others and leave your face clean and hydrated.</li>
      <li>These towels are so gentle-feeling yet they remove tons of makeup easily.</li>
      <li>They work so well and are so easy on the skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just too strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really strong.</li>
      <li>These Wipes are large, smell clean, and leave my skin feeling good.</li>
      <li>They smell wonderful and I love that they contain naturally derived products (about 97% of the ingredients are natural products).</li>
      <li>The fabric is smooth and the scent is lovely, like fresh apples on my face!</li>
      <li>They are very soft, a good size and have a very mild pleasing scent.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m makeup free.  </li>
      <li>i just dont enjoy whatever makes them hurt my face.</li>
      <li>So, please keep this in mind that realistically no wipe is meant to be rinse free, and I believe this wipe is no exception.  </li>
      <li>The scent is nice and they work very well</li>
      <li>but it had a light apple-like scent to it.  </li>
      <li>If I were out of wipes and Neutrogena Naturals were available to me</li>
      <li>The product description and packaging says no rinsing required, I disagree, I did feel a light residue on my skin that went away with rinsing.  </li>
      <li>Those are fabulous.</li>
      <li>This one is good, but so far as I can see</li>
      <li>This one is good, but so far as I can see</li>
      <li>I like that these are natural and I can feel good about using them on my face.</li>
      <li>My only problem with it is that I&#x27;m allergic to most perfumes and this product&#x27;s powerful but otherwise pleasant scent  </li>
      <li>I find most make-up remover towelettes to work pretty well</li>
      <li>So something like this would be great to remove makeup just before bed or to freshen up in the morning or during a long trip.  </li>
      <li>There is no feeling of residue on the skin; it just feels clean.</li>
      <li>face will feel clean after using these towelettes, not soapy or with any medicine-like residue.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these to remove my makeup and clean my face at night</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I like these wipes they clean my face without irritation.</li>
      <li>I got these Neutrogena Naturals Makeup Remover towelettes for when I wear heavier makeup for special occasions.</li>
      <li>the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bit is important to you, you should have that information in deciding whether this one is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worked but not as good as any regular cleanser would.</li>
      <li>Please note, 3 stars is not a bad rating, it means</li>
      <li>To be honest, Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive is not my first choice either, my favorites are Giovanni, but those are not longer available in stores near me, so Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive is the best that is available in stores near me right now.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t leave any residue afterwards or leave my face feeling dry and they have a pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>I guess I feel the cleanest when I wash my face in mild soap and water.  </li>
      <li>Plus high cost per package may be a factor for many.  </li>
      <li>The towelettes are nice and soft and glide right across your face.</li>
      <li>The ingredients list pretty darn clean for a facial wipe, cleansing properties are just fine, I didn&#x27;t care for the smell but one of my daughters really liked the smell</li>
      <li>The towelettes are large, not at all rough or greasy, alcohol free and my skin feels very nice afterwords.  </li>
      <li>These cloths are super easy and gentle on the face.</li>
      <li>I also really like the way they laid out the ingredient list, so you can easily see the source of the ingredients.  </li>
      <li>They are easy to use and are gentle on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Yes these have chemicals, but they are very soft, and refreshing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I find most make-up remover towelettes to work pretty well and I use them when I travel.  Mascara is always more difficult to remove but it can be done with this product and the ingredients list is better than most others on the market.  While there is no alcohol, I find the towelette feels silky while removing the makeup but for a few minutes after my face feels a bit dry, but then that goes away and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  Three to four swipes and I&#x27;m makeup free.  While they did add unnecessary scent, I did not find it to be very strong nor did it linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the packaging.  I really dislike the sticker cover; I prefer a snapping plastic cover like Burt&#x27;s Bees has - no worry about it becoming &amp;#34;unstickable&amp;#34; due to wet hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with these makeup removers. I like using towelettes when I&#x27;m having lazy evenings and don&#x27;t want to wash my face (first world problems, eh?). I&#x27;ve used a number over the years, including Simple Skincare&#x27;s Radiance Cleansing Wipes and Burt&#x27;s Bees Facial Cleansing Towelettes. I like the size of the Neutrogena towelettes, as well as how saturated they were, for they did a good job removing any makeup and whatnot from my face without drying out. Also, once I was finished, it didn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, like some wipes do. I also really like the way they laid out the ingredient list, so you can easily see the source of the ingredients.  The only downside is that they made my face feel slightly dry, more so than the Burt&#x27;s Bees towelettes. I&#x27;m not terribly surprised by this since I have fairly dry skin, and I always moisturize afterward, but I thought it might be helpful for other people skin on the drier side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use make up, but this is a refreshing face wipe even for a guy.  It has a faint apple scent that doesn&#x27;t last long, and it does give my face a pleasant feeling tang early in the morning.  I recommend this to all, male and female alike, for refreshing one&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> A quick, easy and thorough face washer, regardless of how much or how little makeup up needs quick and easy removal. My only problem with it is that I&#x27;m allergic to most perfumes and this product&#x27;s powerful but otherwise pleasant scent  tends to hang around for longer than my nose would prefer.  .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these to remove my makeup and clean my face at night and I really like them.  They are easy to use and are gentle on my skin.  They don&#x27;t leave any residue afterwards or leave my face feeling dry and they have a pleasant scent.  They even remove the stubborn water resistant thick mascara that I wear. When I&#x27;m done using one, I moisturize and head to bed.  Simple!</li>
    <li> I am in love with these wipes!  They are super soft and leave my face feeling fresh and clean without having to use any other cleanser. Most face wipes I&#x27;ve used have to be combined with other types of cleanser but this remover is amazing all by itself.  I have very sensitive skin and after using this product my skin was not red or splotchy at all.  I love that they are natural and that I&#x27;m not putting anything on my body that I can&#x27;t pronounce. This is another great product from neutropenia.</li>
    <li> These are the best facial cleaning wipes I&#x27;ve ever used. I have been using the Simple brand for a year or so and not only are they smaller they leave something on my skin that I feel compelled to rinse off. These Wipes are large, smell clean, and leave my skin feeling good. I do not wear makeup but do have oily skin when I get up in the morning and thats when I typically use these wipes.</li>
    <li> They have a pleasant green apple fragrance. They seemed a little less moist than other wipes I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes happens when I order face wipes from Amazon; maybe something about shipping dries them out. I didn&#x27;t try them for removing makeup, but they are good for my routine face cleansing at night. They seem relatively gentle, which is good, because my skin is sensitive lately. Less residue than most other wipes.</li>
    <li> Really great.  Car Guy ordered these for me and I&#x27;m very glad he did.  I have very sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t use makeup very often.  But when i do and need to remove it I&#x27;m never very happy with the products I&#x27;ve bought.  The just don&#x27;t seem to work well.  These new Neutrogena wipes seem to be what I have been needing, though.  The towelettes are large, not at all rough or greasy, alcohol free and my skin feels very nice afterwords.  I like these towelettes very much.</li>
    <li> They do a good job at taking off my makeup but they are just too rough for my skin. Whenever i use them it hurts my face, especially my eyes. The scent is nice and they work very well i just dont enjoy whatever makes them hurt my face.</li>
    <li> I like other Neutrogena make up remover wipes, but this naturals wipe does not remove make up well.  It burns my eyes, too - I don&#x27;t normally have that issue with other wipes.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> These are great. I&#x27;ve always used Neutrogena makeup remover wipes and these are my new favourite of the bunch. They smell wonderful and I love that they contain naturally derived products (about 97% of the ingredients are natural products). They are not quite as wet as other makeup remover wipes, which I actually prefer as it means they don&#x27;t leave a sheen on my face afterwards. They are still damp enough to take up makeup easily enough though. I&#x27;ll definitely be using these again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take of the makeup and it is so dry</li>
    <li> I love these wipes. I love to use makeup wipes especially when taking off my tough mascara. I have found that these wipes take off not only my foundation but also handle my tough to remove mascara. Using these wipes saves my washcloths from makeup stains. They are handy and convenient for use at home but also to pack when traveling. I like that these are natural and I can feel good about using them on my face. They do not have a heavy scent either and are wonderful on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product, because Neutrogena is a brand I know and trust. I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have to be careful about which products I use to cleanse my face. I&#x27;ve tried several moisturizers and facial washes that were branded as appropriate for sensitive skin that ended up throwing the delicate balance of my skin off and making me break out. These cleansing towelettes are wonderful! They were gentle on my skin, but still removed all of my makeup, including my waterproof mascara. They also smell amazing: I immediately thought of Granny Smith apples when I opened the package. I would definitely recommend these wipes, especially for individuals with sensitive or delicate skin!</li>
    <li> My teen daughter loves these wipes and they do actually work to remove her mascara and facial make up. It is nice that they  are on the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; side too.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. They work so well and are so easy on the skin. I often have issues with products due to sensitive skin, but these were just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena has done it again with this product. This reminds me why I&#x27;m such a fan of Neutrogena products. I&#x27;ll be sure to buy over and over.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love woth these wipes. They work better then others and leave your face clean and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Worked but not as good as any regular cleanser would. Now I&#x27;m not a huge fan of wipes because, from my experience all wipes I&#x27;ve used including this one involve vigorous rubbing in order to get mascara off. Mascara is the one thing holding me back from using wipes. They take off all other makeup perfectly but mascara is always the tricky part. I would rather just wash my face with a cleanser that will see off my makeup along with cleansing my face. Neutrogena natural wipes smell amazing, leave my face feeling soft and refreshed but like I said lack the ability to easily and fully remove mascara. I have yet to find wipes that actually truely do! But other than the mascara thing, I like to use the wipes when I&#x27;m in a hurry or too lazy from a long night of partying to do the whole nightly routine. These would be best for travel!</li>
    <li> The towelettes arrived all dried out.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena naturals wipes are biodegradable which is a plus and don&#x27;t sting. The fragrance however is a bit overpowering and I doubt it is natural.  There are a large number of suspect chemicals including acrylate crosspolymers, benzoic acid (okay if your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive), sodium hydroxide (lye), and ethylhexylglycerin.  It does have alcohol, but under the name phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;OTOH it has no harsh chemical sulfates, phthalates, parabens, or &amp;#34;unnecessary&amp;#34; additives (but a slough of necessary additives according to the package.)  Bottom line, if you are sensitive it isn&#x27;t natural enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is pretty normal and it not only cleaned well but also didn&#x27;t sting delicate areas. I wasn&#x27;t aware of the residue on my face (although all wipes that aren&#x27;t rinsed off have residue.)  Still, a low residue soap and water is better so I will reserve this for plane trips and places without water.</li>
    <li> I have found the Neutrogena line of Naturals to be a lot better for my skin. Regular Neutrogena products normally make my skin itch, and so I really can&#x27;t use them. This product is really gentle though, and it does remove the makeup. The towelettes are nice and soft and glide right across your face. Makes makeup removal a breeze.</li>
    <li> They do what they are supposed to, and remove makeup very well. They also have a pleasant fragrance, but they burn my skin very bad. My eyes have gotten very red, puffy, and irritated from using this product. It is too bad, because they were amazing. It could be the fact that I have sensitive skin, but I cannot get over that burn!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena makes quality skin products and this one seems to be high quality as well.  I think a product like this would most often be used if one was traveling and wanted to freshen up.  I travel a lot and often by train.  Some sleeping accommodations do not have individual bathrooms.  So something like this would be great to remove makeup just before bed or to freshen up in the morning or during a long trip.  Would save a trip down the hall going to the bathroom to wash your face.  This package of towelettes that I received from Vine contained 25 individual towelettes, however, they were not individually wrapped.  When you open the package, they are all together.  I wonder how moist they will stay after some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to have a nice, clean scent and are supposed to remove all dirt, oil and makeup without leaving greasy residue.  They contain Peruvian Tara Seed bionutrient.  Perhaps that makes the sweet smelling scent which I did not find unpleasant, although some may prefer unscented towelettes. The towelettes seemed to remove all my makeup when I tried them at home.  I only used one at a time.  My main concern would be the cost, and the fact they are not individually wrapped--will they dry out?  They are slightly moist but not overly so, such as Wet Naps.  It is not that kind of product.  Seem to be gentle enough for the most sensitive skin.  That being said, I guess I feel the cleanest when I wash my face in mild soap and water.  I would use these for travel, but around the house, I would continue to use my gentle cleansing soap with water for my face.  Plus I think the cost would be very high if these were to be used daily.  But others may like them for full-time use.  Can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product except each one should be individually wrapped to insure freshness so they last longer.  Plus high cost per package may be a factor for many.  Thus, I am taking away one star.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because of the green packaging that made my senses do this but it had a light apple-like scent to it.  The cloth is definitely softer than other facial wipes I have used but a downside of them is they are not biodegradable.  Though you&#x27;re saving water, you are adding to a landfill somewhere with unknown results on how quickly, if at all, this product will break down.  I do say it&#x27;s great at removal of stubborn makeup.  My skin felt a little flush after using but it didn&#x27;t last very long.  It dried rather quickly and left my skin feeling soft &amp; moisturized for long after.  I received this as a free sample from Crowdtap &amp; Neutrogena® Naturals to try, review, and supply my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Yes these have chemicals, but they are very soft, and refreshing.  I use one every day as an astringent, and to remove my makeup.  Nutrogena has always been big when it comes for skin care, and people - like me - trust it.  I&#x27;ve used Dove, and Olay equivalents of this products, and these don&#x27;t make my eyes burn.  What you can do to save money on these types of products is to cut them in half to save money.  They aren&#x27;t rea;;y expensive but it will work out ok if you so desire.  I just would like to shop less:&#x3D;).&lt;br /&gt;I use these every day even if I wore no makeup.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Makeup Remover Towelettes.  The do a great job of cleaning off makeup, even the sometimes difficult to remove eye makeup.  They are very soft, a good size and have a very mild pleasing scent.  I am very careful what products I use on my skin, particularly my face.  I have used the Neutrogena Naturals face wash and I will definitely continue to use these.  I wish they would make a small travel-size pack.  Great product</li>
    <li> Makeup removing face-wipes are a constant go-to for me. I want them to get the job done (remove the makeup, clean the face) without strong odors (allergies) or irritating my skin (drying, abrading). These towelettes deliver on most counts - it&#x27;s a little heavy on the fragrance for me. The scent is not bad, but it&#x27;s still very distinctive and artificial. For &amp;#34;getting the job done&amp;#34;, though, it&#x27;s a decent check,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being part of the &amp;#34;naturals&amp;#34; line, this one offers to do so without &amp;#34;harsh chemicals.&amp;#34; The word naturals there is a bit misleading in context; nature produces plenty of harsh chemicals. &amp;#34;Chemicals&amp;#34; is often used as some buzzword for &amp;#34;man-made&amp;#34;, but it isn&#x27;t - I mean, water is a chemical. It&#x27;s also natural. So is urushiol - the substance that makes us avoid poison ivy - and I&#x27;m not rubbing that on my skin. Chemical isn&#x27;t automatically bad, and natural isn&#x27;t automatically good. What matters is what chemicals the product contains, and I imagine that at least some people looking for &amp;#34;naturals&amp;#34; care about the particulars. Since the listing here falls down on that count, without further ado, this one has: &amp;#34;Water, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Heptyl Undecylenate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Phenoxyethanol, Sucrose Cocoate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dehydroacetic Acid, Glycerin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Hydrolyzed, Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bit is important to you, you should have that information in deciding whether this one is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s not, you might want to price check to see how this stacks up against other functional face cleaning towelettes. At this writing, Amazon has no price information for this item, so I don&#x27;t know how it stacks up against their other makeup removing towelettes or against those of other brands. This one is good, but so far as I can see it&#x27;s not magic - I myself would not invest extra to get it.ettes or against those of other brands. This one is good, but so far as I can see it&#x27;s not magic - I myself would not invest extra to get it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for removing makeup, including mascara. I did have a bit of a problem removing waterproof mascara but haven&#x27;t found a cleanser yet that completely removes it quickly. The towelettes are soft and don&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy; instead, it feels clean and fresh. My only problem - the towelettes on top can be a bit dry compared to those near the bottom.</li>
    <li> I love any neutrogena product, I can trust the name.&lt;br /&gt;I have always used baby wipes to wipe my make up off, but sometimes I do not use the right kind for my face. Some do have chemicals. My face deserves better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often go hiking with my husband and girlfriend, and need to wipe the trail off and reapply makeup to go out on the town afterwords. I cannot bring a giant packet so this portable packet is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and wiping my face with these feels refreshing and does not sting at all. This takes off even the toughest make up (glitter included)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B000WOU3I8 Garnier Cleansing Towelettes]] to remove makeup for a long time. But I dislike the sticky feeling that they leave behind. I was glad to try these facial wipes. I like them much better! There is no feeling of residue on the skin; it just feels clean. The package says the ingredients are 97% natural, but there are 11 chemical-sounding ingredients that they call \\&quot;essential to blend the product together and maintain effectiveness.\\&quot; One of those 11 ingredients is the fragrance, which I wouldn&#x27;t think is \\&quot;essential\\&quot; to anything. And let&#x27;s talk about that fragrance. It&#x27;s a very strong green apple scent, and I&#x27;m not a fan of that smell. I guess it&#x27;s supposed to be a clean scent, but it&#x27;s a fake sort of smell that has me thinking I&#x27;m in a candle shop somewhere. UPDATE: The wipes dried out before the end of the 25 days. After I used one, I&#x27;d go over my face again with one of the Garniers (that I don&#x27;t like as well) to remove the rest of my makeup. At least the Garnier wipes have enough moisture.</li>
    <li> Effective at removing makeup, the towelettes are soft, easy on sensitive skin.  The aroma is a little off-putting, not perfume-y or chemical in nature, but unidentifiable to anyone in our household and not entirely pleasant (but not obnoxiously unpleasant, either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your face will feel clean after using these towelettes, not soapy or with any medicine-like residue.  The fact that these ingredients are naturally derived makes one feel good about using them, despite the unusual (and very subjective) aroma.  We&#x27;ll probably end up purchasing more of these packs.</li>
    <li> I love Netrogena in particular, but these wipes are especially great. I&#x27;m particularly great about removing makeup and washing my face at night, so these wipes are a godsend to me. Now I use them every night. They remove so much makeup is seems like they remove it all.  They don&#x27;t remove it all, as I can see in the morning, but they remove enough that this product is definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to a beauty product before but this one broke me out in hives that took 2 weeks to go down. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I have the face wash equivalent of this item also and had no issues with that product.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve every used!  Highly recommend.  These removed an impressive amount of make up at the end of the day.  I was able to use these for several days without a breakout or issue.  They have a very light fruity fragrance and leave no film after use.  While cost wise, they would be pricey to use twice a day I will definitely be purchasing these for travel, gym, and keeping some around for late nights when I&#x27;m too lazy to wait for the water to warm up.</li>
    <li> Please note, 3 stars is not a bad rating, it means just OKAY, 4 stars is supposed to be &#x27;liked it&#x27; and 5 stars is supposed to be &#x27;loved it&#x27;.  So, these wipes were just okay.  We usually used Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive ones and the ingrdient list is almost identical to these Neutrogena Naturals.  The ingredients list pretty darn clean for a facial wipe, cleansing properties are just fine, I didn&#x27;t care for the smell but one of my daughters really liked the smell so that is obviously somehting personal.  I did not like the moisture level of these wipes, I&#x27;d have wanted them wetter.  The product description and packaging says no rinsing required, I disagree, I did feel a light residue on my skin that went away with rinsing.  I have read and heard from all sorts of health sources that one must rinse after any kind of wipe, that stuff is left behind that should not left on the skin.  So, please keep this in mind that realistically no wipe is meant to be rinse free, and I believe this wipe is no exception.  To be honest, Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive is not my first choice either, my favorites are Giovanni, but those are not longer available in stores near me, so Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive is the best that is available in stores near me right now.  If I were out of wipes and Neutrogena Naturals were available to me I would buy them definitetly, the ingredient list makes them completely acceptable, I would just prefer the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive due to scent and moisture content.</li>
    <li> Even though sometimes I get too tired and lazy to wash my face at night, I still make sure to remove my makeup before I go to bed. The main reason for that is, first breakouts, and second my eyes really hurt in the morning, if I sleep with my mascara on. That is why I am a big fan of makeup removal wipes. Neutrogena Purifying Makeup Remover Wipes are formulated without harsh chemicals, sulfates, parabens, petrolatum, dyes and phthalates. There are 25 pre-moistened wipes in a package, with size 7.2 x 7.0 in (182 x 177 mm) each.&lt;br /&gt;I use Neutrogena Purifying Makeup Remover Wipes every night to remove my makeup and they are really awesome. They melt away makeup and dirt and leave my skin very refreshed and soft. For those lazy nights, I don&#x60;t even have to wash my face or use moisturizer, because my skin feels clean and hydrated. The wipes also smell great and are very gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> I was using Pampers Sensitive baby wipes to remove my makeup prior to my face cleansing regime but wanted to try actual makeup remover wipes especially since I like other products from the same Neutrogena line.  While it did do it&#x27;s job removing everything from foundation to waterproof mascara, I found the scent to be somewhat unappealing.  They are thick wipes and don&#x27;t fall apart so if you can get past the scent, these are decent.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily feel like they cleaned better than the baby wipes as when I used these, I always felt like there a was a bit of a residue on my face afterwards compared to the baby wipes.</li>
    <li> These towels are so gentle-feeling yet they remove tons of makeup easily. They&#x27;re moist but not greasy-feeling and they don&#x27;t leave any gross residue on your face. LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> Hi there, do you like black circles left around your eyes? Do you like to scrub your face for more than 4 minutes? And most importantly do you like your face and eyes to feel like it got acid burns? If you answered yes then these are the products for you! All joking aside. These s***s suck. And they cost more than most. I cannot reccomend more the No. 7 brand make up remover wipes. Those are fabulous. These.. Just no.</li>
    <li> I ve used. before  Really like!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive/normal to oily skin and these worked well, no stinging or anything like that and they were well moistened. I&#x27;d buy them again but I&#x27;ve been looking into some cheaper options.</li>
    <li> I generally trust Neutrogena products more than any other retail commercial skin care brand, and these towelettes seem to be in keeping with that high esteem. I wear minimal makeup, so they clean my face of it well without leaving any residue, tackiness, or tightness. My skin is fairly sensitive, and these didn&#x27;t irritate at all, or leave redness. The towelettes are soft, light, and sized nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I am not fond of is their strong scent. The scent isn&#x27;t bad--it&#x27;s a natural apple or fruity aroma. It&#x27;s just too strong. I could still smell it hours after I used the towelettes.</li>
    <li> I love these cloths! I&#x27;m terrible about remembering to take my makeup off every night, and 9 times out of 10 I sleep with it on. These cloths are super easy and gentle on the face. One cloth takes off all my makeup...foundation and mascara. They&#x27;ve been &#x27;Currently Unavailable&#x27; for awhile now, but I really hope Amazon gets more in because I&#x27;ll absolutely start purchasing them on a regular basis. I use one every night before bed now!</li>
    <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemical sulfates, parabens, petrolatum, dyes, and phthaletes. I am not an expert on these chemicals but I am glad to see that Neutrogena is trying to be more eco-friendly. It does a good job removing the makeup and my waterproof mascara. However, I do use it together with mascara remover oil-based pads. One minor setback is the aroma on these pads. It&#x27;s really strong. I guess they want you to feel like you have just washed your face with soap with such a strong scent. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product for removing makeup and feeling refresh after a long day with so much dirt and oil on your skin.</li>
    <li> I got these Neutrogena Naturals Makeup Remover towelettes for when I wear heavier makeup for special occasions. I had to go over my eye makeup a couple times but did come off completely without tugging. The towelettes were not soaked but slightly wet, so I may end up having to add more water in the package, depends. These are not big enough to cut in half and use separately, so it was just a one time use per towelette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the Neutrogena company using 97% naturally derived ingredients, supports clean/renewable energy. The ingredients were printed on the package to explain each ingredient and where the source came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like these wipes they clean my face without irritation. I still apply moisturizer on afterwards. The fabric is smooth and the scent is lovely, like fresh apples on my face! For the price, I would have preferred 30 towelettes for the entire month instead of just 25 per package.</li>
