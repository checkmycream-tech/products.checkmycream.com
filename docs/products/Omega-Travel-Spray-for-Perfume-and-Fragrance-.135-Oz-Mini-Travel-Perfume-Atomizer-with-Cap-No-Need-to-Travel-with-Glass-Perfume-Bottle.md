      <li>Everyone was happy and it won&#x27;t take my 25 years to use up my bottle of perfume!</li>
      <li>When I add in the cost of the perfume it turned out to be a fairly pricey purchase.</li>
      <li>It is a great alternative for the Travalo which is kind of overpriced.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I was sent a dud, since others have given this product a good review, but I suggest buyer beware.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I did.  </li>
      <li>Am extremely satisfied with this product!</li>
      <li>Will search for better quality product!</li>
      <li>Easy to fill and in a great size to pop into my purse</li>
      <li>Over all I am very happy with my Omega Perfume Atomizer and will recommend it to those who have to travel a lot or are out of the house a lot and like to have a fresh scent available at all times.   </li>
      <li>I just love having fragrances with me in case I want to smell good:)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It was very easy to fill.</li>
      <li>I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN LIP GLOSS, AND</li>
      <li>When it becomes more popular, there would probably be more inexpensive options</li>
      <li>Regarding the seller -&gt; The product description matched perfectly and the shipping was super fast!</li>
      <li>This is just something to keep in mind as you all plan to fill this atomizer with your favorite scent.</li>
      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>It takes up no space and works better than the spray bottle.</li>
      <li>You may want more than one of these - perhaps one for your purse and one for travel.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the concept but it leaked all over.  </li>
      <li>It is kind of cheaply made.</li>
      <li>and I would buy more.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately most of the time it does not work.   </li>
      <li>Even when traveling by car, it&#x27;s nice not to have to lug a full size bottle.</li>
      <li>This travel perfume atomizer is extremely easy to use, once you figure out how to fill it.</li>
      <li>Even with a price of $3.99 I would strongly discourage everyone from purchasing this product unless you are intent on using it one time.  </li>
      <li>I got the product to work fine.  </li>
      <li>Received product earlier than predicted and it works great.</li>
      <li>: I received a free sample to facilitate my review.</li>
      <li>Instead i filled it with splash and in 4 pumps it was filled.</li>
      <li>Not all perfume bottles will fit the valve.</li>
      <li>It was so easy to transfer from the spray bottle - exactly like the video!  </li>
      <li>I bought three bottles, worked great at first, BUT each of them broke after the second refill.</li>
      <li>I love it, i really do</li>
      <li>I purchased the Omega travel spray and was in absolute love...</li>
      <li>The one problem I had with this travel spray is that some of my perfume bottle stems are too large to fit into the bottom hole that pumps the perfume inside.</li>
      <li>This post reflects my honest, personal opinion and experience with the product which may differ from yours.</li>
      <li>Try a different kind.</li>
      <li>Also, the spray provided is quite effective, a simple push with your finger is all you need!    </li>
      <li>I received a very large bottle of perfume for Christmas and wanted to share with my daughters at college.  </li>
      <li>The Omega Perfume Atomizer is tiny enough it would fit nicely in your purse allowing you for a quick spritz before going out.</li>
      <li>and it was shipped super fast.</li>
      <li>No more lugging around  those huge perfume bottles and risk breaking them!!!</li>
      <li>However since the fill valve is very much size dependent, it would help to include an adapter or two.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>First, I admit that I have not contacted the seller about this product.  </li>
      <li>I will probably stick to just buying the smallest size of my favorite perfumes in the future to travel with.</li>
      <li>Still satisfied overall</li>
      <li>I at first had problems figuring out how to fill the bottle even after looking at the photo directions on the box.</li>
      <li>I would really recommend it!</li>
      <li>Was great for about a month, but then all the perfume slowly leaked out.</li>
      <li>At first I tried to pull off the cap and unscrew the spray nozzle.</li>
      <li>but the entire contents when full leaked all over everything in my suitcase!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no mess, easy to fill, nice and small and compact.    </li>
      <li>so I did not have to travel with a huge bottle of cologne for a recent business trip.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
      <li>Complete junk, not even worth the cost or hassle to return.  </li>
      <li>Them you just pump until the tiny bottle is filled.</li>
      <li>The lid comes off with a piece that shouldn&#x27;t really come off but that doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the product.</li>
      <li>This is really the no hassle way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We had high hopes for this because my husband travels a lot and when he goes with just a carry-on bag he couldn&#x27;t take his large bottle of cologne.</li>
      <li>Filling was very easy and with the small window provided, you get to see it getting filled and can stop whenever you feel you have transferred enough!</li>
      <li>I on,y wish it were half the price and had more colours.</li>
      <li>I was pretty pleased when I came across this item to carry small quantities of perfume when traveling.</li>
      <li>My original review was raving but, unfortunately, consistent with other reviews, it does indeed leak.  </li>
      <li>Not only was I able to fill it only once</li>
      <li>But once I figured it out the filling was quick and simple.</li>
      <li>But like a few of the other reviews reported, it works great.</li>
      <li>As a result I wasn&#x27;t able to take my favorite perfume on my trip, I had to use another type that the stem would fit into the base.</li>
      <li>Will not spend $10 every 2 weeks for a new bottle.</li>
      <li>well it is a new product/idea</li>
      <li>I really like the idea and the product in general and</li>
      <li>And so far no problems with leaks or unintentionally discharges--</li>
      <li>As a frequent traveler I pride myself on not checking bags, being hyper efficient and doing everything I can to maintain ubiquity wherever I am.  </li>
      <li>It was so easy transfering perfume into this container, just push the bottom of it down onto the bigger perfume bottle, and voila.  </li>
      <li>There is no mess and no wasting perfume, not to mention no destruction of a perfume bottle.</li>
      <li>No mess, no fuss.</li>
      <li>This product is small, about the size of a lipstick, and lightweight too even when filled to the brim.</li>
      <li>A few quick pumps and the cologne was in the bottle.</li>
      <li>I always have two bottle of my favorite scent - one for everyday use, and the other to refill the travel atomizer.</li>
      <li>as when I tried, the rubber part that allows transfer from the big bottle to the travel bottle came out completely.</li>
      <li>and you simply fill it directly from the perfume bottle after removing the perfume bottle&#x27;s nozzle.</li>
      <li>My old atomizer was a re-purposed sample bottle from the department store, and I had lost the necessary eye dropper to get the cologne from the larger bottle to the travel bottle.</li>

<li> for like 6 business trips until it started to corrode, and not hold the fragrance--it was leaking out onto my other toiletries.    </li>
<li> You&#x27;re supposed to remove the cap from the atomizer and remove the cap from your bottle of cologne/perfume and somehow pump the tips up and down together.</li>
<li> The aperture where you load the perfume will only take two or three sprays rendering it useless, as that is not enough to fill the cavity.  </li>
<li> I think I ordered too few</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First, I admit that I have not contacted the seller about this product.  I knew that I would be flying a lot during the holiday season, so in order to have cologne, I bought this Omega Travel Spray.  After I landed, I found that it leaked during flight.  I have tried several times since and found that the perfume leaks during air flights.    The idea and design are excellent and something a traveller should consider, but mine didn&#x27;t work well.  It leaks on the bottom through the valve when you fill it with cologne.      Today the silicone grommet covering the input nozzle fell out as I was inspecting it under a magnifying glass.    tmc</li>
    <li> Received product earlier than predicted and it works great. My spouse and I used one each for our recent travel. It takes up no space and works better than the spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Got this item as a stocking stuffer.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to fill even halfway and I lost a lot of perfume during the transfer.  Still satisfied overall and it was shipped super fast.</li>
    <li> My original review was raving but, unfortunately, consistent with other reviews, it does indeed leak.  If anyone else has a suggestion for a product that is similar without the leaking problem, please respond.</li>
    <li> We had high hopes for this because my husband travels a lot and when he goes with just a carry-on bag he couldn&#x27;t take his large bottle of cologne. We&#x27;d seen it sold via the duty-free magazines on airlines too. But like a few of the other reviews reported, it works great. For one use. Then it leaked and couldn&#x27;t be refilled for a second fill up. I see they are no longer selling this product and now I know why. It&#x27;s a nearly complete waste of money when it only works for one fill. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I recommend watching the video that is posted in the reviews. The one problem I had with this travel spray is that some of my perfume bottle stems are too large to fit into the bottom hole that pumps the perfume inside. As a result I wasn&#x27;t able to take my favorite perfume on my trip, I had to use another type that the stem would fit into the base. I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this again. I will probably stick to just buying the smallest size of my favorite perfumes in the future to travel with.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use. Sprays well, and I like that I can mix different perfumes to make a custom scent. I on,y wish it were half the price and had more colours. And bigger.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a small atomizer so I did not have to travel with a huge bottle of cologne for a recent business trip. My old atomizer was a re-purposed sample bottle from the department store, and I had lost the necessary eye dropper to get the cologne from the larger bottle to the travel bottle. I found this product and it recently arrived. It&#x27;s great! It was a snap to fill up - all I had to do was remove the spray nozzle from my current bottle, and insert the tube in the pump at the bottom of the atomizer. A few quick pumps and the cologne was in the bottle. No mess, no fuss. Note: some brands of perfume/cologne, like mine, are designed so that the spray pump are housed in an ornate fashion. I always have two bottle of my favorite scent - one for everyday use, and the other to refill the travel atomizer. This is just something to keep in mind as you all plan to fill this atomizer with your favorite scent.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in January and have already taken it on two trips. Perfect size for the quart bag for airline travel. Even when traveling by car, it&#x27;s nice not to have to lug a full size bottle. It was very easy to fill. And so far no problems with leaks or unintentionally discharges--a problem I&#x27;ve had when traveling with my full-size bottle in the past.</li>
    <li> I bought three bottles, worked great at first, BUT each of them broke after the second refill. No matter how carefully I connected it to the parfume bottle; it just wouldnt refill, so I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore and had to throw away all of them. Each lasted just a couple of weeks. Will not spend $10 every 2 weeks for a new bottle. So frustrating and such a waste of money! Will search for better quality product!</li>
    <li> As a frequent traveler I pride myself on not checking bags, being hyper efficient and doing everything I can to maintain ubiquity wherever I am.  Cologne was always that luxury that I didn&#x27;t bring with me on my travels...   I purchased the Omega travel spray and was in absolute love... for like 6 business trips until it started to corrode, and not hold the fragrance--it was leaking out onto my other toiletries.    Bad purchase.  I&#x27;d say go w/ another brand.</li>
    <li> I kept this in a pouch in my work bag. Was great for about a month, but then all the perfume slowly leaked out. I was unable to fill it a second time, as when I tried, the rubber part that allows transfer from the big bottle to the travel bottle came out completely. I&#x27;m going to try a Travalo instead and recommend you skip this product entirely.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I was sent a dud, since others have given this product a good review, but I suggest buyer beware.  I had no trouble filling the bottle but immediately noticed that it seemed to leak a little.  I hoped I had simply gotten some perfume on the outside of the bottle but, just in case, I sealed it in a small ziploc plastic bag.  It&#x27;s a good thing I did.  I flew across country and in that process, every single drop leaked out of this spray bottle and into the plastic bag.  Complete junk, not even worth the cost or hassle to return.  I threw it away in the hotel trash.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive but there&#x27;s no way to fill this item which makes it useless. You&#x27;re supposed to remove the cap from the atomizer and remove the cap from your bottle of cologne/perfume and somehow pump the tips up and down together. There was no way I could do it without getting cologne all over my hands and not a drop IN the atomizer. I tried for about ten minutes then decided that I had wasted enough cologne and sent the item back.</li>
    <li> When everything lines up, it works like a charm. Unfortunately most of the time it does not work.   After about 10 times of filling or attempted filling, the silicone filling nozzle broke and it totally stopped working.</li>
    <li> I love the concept but it leaked all over.  The bottom where you fill the spray slowly leaked until it was all gone. It took about a week.</li>
    <li> This is just the size I was looking for!  It was so easy transfering perfume into this container, just push the bottom of it down onto the bigger perfume bottle, and voila.  It&#x27;s the size of a smaller lipgloss tube and has virtually no weight to it.</li>
    <li> This travel perfume atomizer is extremely easy to use, once you figure out how to fill it. At first I tried to pull off the cap and unscrew the spray nozzle. This did not work. I then realized the atomizer has a valve at one end and you simply fill it directly from the perfume bottle after removing the perfume bottle&#x27;s nozzle. You may want more than one of these - perhaps one for your purse and one for travel. These are also great as stocking stuffers! I have two and I love them. I think you will too. There is no mess and no wasting perfume, not to mention no destruction of a perfume bottle. This is really the no hassle way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I at first had problems figuring out how to fill the bottle even after looking at the photo directions on the box. But once I figured it out the filling was quick and simple. All you have to do it remove the pump part of your perfume and place the straw that is sticking out of the perfume bottom over the hole on the bottom of the Omega Perfume Atomizer. Them you just pump until the tiny bottle is filled. It&#x27;s no mess, easy to fill, nice and small and compact.    The Omega Perfume Atomizer is tiny enough it would fit nicely in your purse allowing you for a quick spritz before going out. The bottle is about the size of a lipstick container.    Over all I am very happy with my Omega Perfume Atomizer and will recommend it to those who have to travel a lot or are out of the house a lot and like to have a fresh scent available at all times.   -----------------------  * Disclaimer / Disclosure: I received a free sample to facilitate my review.

    <li> Am extremely satisfied with this product! I ordered 4 and wondered if i was going overboard, but guess what?! I think I ordered too few, cause as soon as my friends/sisters/ colleagues saw it, it was like falling into a shark tank with an open bleeding wound!!!    This product is small, about the size of a lipstick, and lightweight too even when filled to the brim. Filling was very easy and with the small window provided, you get to see it getting filled and can stop whenever you feel you have transferred enough! Have been carrying mine around for a few weeks with no spillage whatsoever. Also, the spray provided is quite effective, a simple push with your finger is all you need!    If you like to carry perfume around with you (to work, while you travel or just when you are headed out and feel the need to freshen up) this is the way to go. No more lugging around  those huge perfume bottles and risk breaking them!!! I also don&#x27;t feel guilty buying the 3.3oz or 4.2 oz perfume bottles anymore, as i know that I can now carry the fragrance without the bottle!!    Five stars and three cheers!!    Regarding the seller -&gt; The product description matched perfectly and the shipping was super fast! No complaints at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I really wanted the \\&quot;travalo\\&quot; but it was very expensive. I think this product is still kind of expensive for what it is but the little hole thing on the bottom, the size, etc. is soo convenient I still payed 10 something for it!. It is kind of cheaply made. The lid comes off with a piece that shouldn&#x27;t really come off but that doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the product. I think it should be cheaper for the quality but oh well it is a new product/idea so I don&#x27;t really care. When it becomes more popular, there would probably be more inexpensive options and I would buy more. It works like it should. It basically does the job. It is a great alternative for the Travalo which is kind of overpriced. I really like the idea and the product in general and the size is perfect. I just love having fragrances with me in case I want to smell good:) I would really recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was pretty pleased when I came across this item to carry small quantities of perfume when traveling. Easy to fill and in a great size to pop into my purse but the entire purse reeked of perfume leaking by the time I exited the airplane. When I add in the cost of the perfume it turned out to be a fairly pricey purchase. Returned it today for a refund.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. The only flaw i found is that with expensive perfume the pumping device in the perfume is smaller therefore making if harder to be filled. Instead i filled it with splash and in 4 pumps it was filled. I love it, i really do</li>
    <li> After a bit of trial and error I got the product to work fine.  However since the fill valve is very much size dependent, it would help to include an adapter or two. Not all perfume bottles will fit the valve.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  I received a very large bottle of perfume for Christmas and wanted to share with my daughters at college.  It was so easy to transfer from the spray bottle - exactly like the video!  Everyone was happy and it won&#x27;t take my 25 years to use up my bottle of perfume!</li>
    <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN LIP GLOSS, AND ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE NOT FOR WHAT I DO.THEY LEAK VERY BAD</li>
    <li> Even with a price of $3.99 I would strongly discourage everyone from purchasing this product unless you are intent on using it one time.  Not only was I able to fill it only once but the entire contents when full leaked all over everything in my suitcase!</li>
    <li> Got this for a trip.  Come to find out it is non-functional.  The aperture where you load the perfume will only take two or three sprays rendering it useless, as that is not enough to fill the cavity.  AND they won&#x27;t take their defective product back!  Try a different kind.</li>
