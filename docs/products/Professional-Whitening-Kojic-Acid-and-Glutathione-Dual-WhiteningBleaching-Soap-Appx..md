<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It lasts only maybe 3 weeks and I have not seen a difference in my skin color. I am a caramel complexion &amp; was looking to brighten my skin. After the use of the bar, it leaves your skin feeling that &amp;#34;squeeky clean&amp;#34; and not in a good way. The product came fast in the mail, but otherwise, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it too long. Seeing a little difference.Hopefully it continues to bleach alot more</li>
    <li> This product that I have recently ordered works wonders on the skin and makes&lt;br /&gt;your face feel so sqeaky clean</li>
    <li> Have not seen change yet still using stings a little bit but i think it may work i need to use more often to tell</li>
    <li> This soap definitely works! It has gotten rid of some of my sun-damage. My tan definitely went away within the first week of using this product. The only thing is that it goes by so quickly. It was gone within 2 weeks. When using this product, make sure you have a very good moisturizing lotion that goes along with it as it dries out your skin. Overall, I am happy I bought this.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome soap I never want to live without it. The first bar has made my skin soft , clear smooth and bright. I also use it for the ruff and bumpy parts of my body and it has softend and smoothed the skin there too! As for lighten my skin no it has not done that. I simply wash on and rinse off.</li>
    <li> Ok here goes Omg omg the best skin product ever. I had black deep scars on my chin from electrolylis.this stuf lightened up my scars on my chin in 5 days i can not believe it. I paired it with 7 day Fair and white. Please order.</li>
    <li> This also is a great skin product it makes your skin feel great, has a great smell on cleaness and does the job. I would recomment this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is  great soap stronger O.M.G!!!..yes hunnie it works I was pretty now I&#x27;m just beautiful !!!Grl bye to makeup... I  love this soap!!!Real Talk!!! Will be buying plenty more hunnie!!Thanks to y&#x27;all for  making it!!!I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> After buying this product about a month ago I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day every day and I want to say that it works but I really can&#x27;t tell. I&#x27;ll still keep using it to see if it is really working or not</li>
    <li> It is a nice soap, but I haven&#x27;t seen any change in my dark spots on my face, so I will not reorder this product..</li>
    <li> Expect micro peeling. Strong antioxidant. I use it once a week to exfoliate skin. Not going to make you white but it does brighten the skin which is nice for me. It gives me a youthful glow.</li>
    <li> more of  glutathione and barely any kojic !!</li>
    <li> Very good.  Satisfied. Using it every day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to say if its working. I&#x27;ve only used it for about 2-3 weeks. But so far I like it. It lathers up really well. It makes my face feel so soft. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> It works my skin is really smooth and the acne is gone I&#x27;m so happy money well spent I want to order more I even recommended it to my sister.</li>
    <li> This soap is idea for keeping the facial area clear,  soft and radiant. I love the way it keeps my face feeling soft and wrinkle free.</li>
    <li> This smells very good and is not too irritating to the skin, at least for me... I haven&#x27;t seen some results (I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days). I am using it as a lightener for my inner thighs and it seems to be working so I am pleased with the purchase. I wouldn&#x27;t expect dramatic results from this, if you want more dramatic results you would probably want to use this item along with a cream.</li>
    <li> This soap didn&#x27;t lighten any of my scars and I don&#x27;t feel like it did anything for evening out my complexion but it great for keeping my face acne free.</li>
    <li> This is one the best brands on the market. It helps to even out my skin tone and gives me a beautiful glow. I will certainly continue to use.</li>
    <li> I tell ypu a secret! For&lt;br /&gt;Those people that saying its easly melt? (not so good on english)&lt;br /&gt;Cut it into theree pices that should do the trick. And too keep it fress&lt;br /&gt;Dot let the the rest expose to air. Put it back into plastic and seal it will tape</li>
    <li> Used it for months. There was no visible change to myself and I took pics everyday to have a scale of measure. Just dried my skin out. But the placebo effect allowed me to feel a little better even though nothing actually changed. so 2 stars.</li>
    <li> the significant decrease in the darkness of the marks on my inner thighs are worth more than I can put into words here-thank you so very much-it worked fast-balanced the skin tone that did not need whitening without \\&quot;bleaching\\&quot; it out. The soap does make you dry but natural scar lotion takes it away immediately. This soap is now a mainstay in my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> Works well on my body.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to lighten my arm pits and my intimate area.  It did a pretty good job.  I&#x27;ll keep buying.</li>
    <li> This soap actually made the stretch marks on my stomach lighter. My underams has gotten lighter too. I use it 2 times a day I let it stay on my skin a few minutes before washing it off.</li>
    <li> I used the soap for 3mths twice a day and my acne scars never faded. All I got was dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Which is odd seeing that I have very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I never left the soap on for more than 10 to 15 mins at a time and washed it off with warm water before applying a oil free moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I can say it does is remove dirt. But than again, so does every other soap on the market.</li>
    <li> This product is not what it says it is and may be harmful as well. I&#x27;ve used a whitening soap in the past many times and never had reaction like I did when using this &amp;#34;soap.&amp;#34; Beware of this crap!</li>
    <li> Its good for my skin. It leave my skin clean and very smooth, Im very glad with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I can back to buy this product</li>
    <li> The bad is it melts easily so if u shower more than once a day then u need more than one tab a month. The good is that yesssss.it works perfectly</li>
    <li> This product was ok.....it definitely did NOT bleach and/or brightened my skin.  I do have sensitive skin and it did not irritate my skin.  I get the same results from Ivory soap as I did with this soap.</li>
    <li> I heard about the wonders of Papaya soap and bought this to try it out to lighten some acne scars and freckles on my face, and I have to say it really does work. I&#x27;ve been using it once a day at night for the past two weeks, letting the soap bubbles soak into my skin for a few minutes, and I do feel a tingly sensation. I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s reducing my acne, but it sure is lightening the acne scars I have on my forehead and chin, and the freckles near my eyes. I have combination sensitive skin with an oily t-zone and it&#x27;s working to keep the oil production down a bit, but if you have sensitive skin I&#x27;d recommend using it every other day.</li>
    <li> It really works! I saw a difference within 2wks!! It&#x27;s best to order more than one, because it goes really fast, but it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny! Thumbs up</li>
    <li> Nice soap fêles gréât ont hé body with thé mix Of my lotion everything work just as i planed thank youb</li>
    <li> Fast shiping I can see good results second time I purchase it! I recomend it</li>
    <li> Well I got it in like four days and i have been using it for two days so, I should wait more to see some results.</li>
    <li> Great Product- with Delivery!!</li>
    <li> Woah, glutathione in combination with kojic acid is amazing !! This with fair and white and pineapple aha arbutin will leave you a shade lighter in a month but results seen in 2 weeks. Proper exfoliation and sunscreen are needed to see results</li>
    <li> The product is excellent for skin whitening.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about two weeks...may have skipped about three days. I notice that it is very good at cleansing the skin. I will lather with my clarisonic and let it rest on my skin for about 3 minutes and rinse. I notice it does tingle my lips only if some gets on it. (Now I make sure I tuck my lips in when cleansing). I also use a fade cream afterwards. After use, my skin feels clean and tight but not that annoying type of dryness. I have combo skin- oily T-zone. I will continue to use consistently for the next two weeks to see if I can really notice a difference in my skin discolorations. Overall, I like it and I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I tried this soap before and Within 2 weeks of using this soap, my skin got lighter and my skin got soft. My stretch marks from pregnancy on my stomach is going away. I leave on my body for 2 minutes then wash it off.  Also this soap last for at least 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Saw results within days.. Works quickly to even out scars and blemishes..</li>
    <li> I read a TON of reviews and discussions about this product before I bought it, so I went in with my eyes open. Its NOT a &amp;#34;wash and go&amp;#34; product. When you wash, you have to let it soak in for a minute or two then rinse. It might sting a little. (It&#x27;s ACID. It&#x27;s supposed to. That&#x27;s how it does its job.) The sting is not horrible but if you overdo leaving it on, you will definitely feel it afterwards. I also do not have sensitive skin. I do know the difference between a normal chemical reaction, and an allergic reaction. This &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; is just chemical normality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: Used washcloth, Left it on for about 30 seconds then rinsed with WARM water and airdried. No stinging. Immediate change in skin. Clean, clear, and bright. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: Used mild buffing pad, left it on for about 3 minutes and rinsed with warm water when the stinging started.&lt;br /&gt;Airdry then apply sunscreen &amp; makeup in the morning. At night, Airdry &amp; apply whipped shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Immediate change again! Clean, Clear, and my face had a natural &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;. Skin was tight &amp; blemishes lighter already.&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: Used mild buffing pad, left it on until stinging started, rinsed with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;Daytime - OMG! Went to put on my sunscreen and makeup and my makeup shade was darker than my face. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! It may not be a full shade, but definitely different from what it was 2 days ago. (Great excuse to shop!)&lt;br /&gt;Night time - Left it on for almost 20 mins, distracted by a tv show, and there was minor stinging when I rinsed it off. I decided to do something different and use a lactic acid gel before the Shea. For about 60 seconds it burned like flames of the hottest hellfire. And then I let it absorb and put on the whipped shea. All was right with the world again.&lt;br /&gt;Started using head to toe at night after the third day, minus the lactic acid and keeping the whipped shea.&lt;br /&gt;On the morning of day 4, I had some facial peeling which is normal considering I used the lactic acid gel with it. I&#x27;m staying with the Wash, Wait, Rinse, methodology. It&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;- if there&#x27;s more orange when you wash then it stings, but if there&#x27;s more white then it doesnt.&lt;br /&gt;- Sunscreen is a MUST. Otherwise you&#x27;re un-doing all of the benefits and probably thinking it doesnt work. I&#x27;m using  Aveeno SPF 70 Sunscreen, and switching to Neutrogena SPF 110 by the end of the week. The more you use it, the highter SPF you should use. I dont recommend anything less than SPF 50 to start. (Sunscreen, then makeup.)&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re doing it right, you should see results immediately. A little bit more each day.&lt;br /&gt;- Take photos so you can see your progress. The mirror LIES.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesnt really have a smell. I guess that&#x27;s better than a bad smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it to even my skin tone head to toe, and already I feel like I&#x27;m well on my way. My face WAS significantly darker than my chest a few days ago. For those using to alter skin tone, I&#x27;m guessing the key is in leaving it on longer and using it at least 2x a day.ring I used the lactic acid gel with it. I&#x27;m staying with the Wash, Wait, Rinse, methodology. It&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;- if there&#x27;s more orange when you wash then it stings, but if there&#x27;s more white then it doesnt.&lt;br /&gt;- Sunscreen is a MUST. Otherwise you&#x27;re un-doing all of the benefits and probably thinking it doesnt work. I&#x27;m using  Aveeno SPF 70 Sunscreen, and switching to Neutrogena SPF 110 by the end of the week. The more you use it, the highter SPF you should use. I dont recommend anything less than SPF 50 to start. (Sunscreen, then makeup.)&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re doing it right, you should see results immediately. A little bit more each day.&lt;br /&gt;- Take photos so you can see your progress. The mirror LIES.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesnt really have a smell. I guess that&#x27;s better than a bad smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it to even my skin tone head to toe, and already I feel like I&#x27;m well on my way. My face WAS significantly darker than my chest a few days ago. For those using to alter skin tone, I&#x27;m guessing the key is in leaving it on longer and using it at least 2x a day.</li>
    <li> This soap works great. It gets me so clean and soft.. it&#x27;s great stuff . I will order really soon.  get for.my face and oily skin</li>
    <li> Really cleansed the skin..great foe facial mask..I just wish the soap was bigger so that it couldve lasted longer .</li>
    <li> It worked on my freckles and blotches helping to fade them the bar is a bit small though I have spots on my hands and forearms.</li>
    <li> This soap is so nice for pimple. I love it&lt;br /&gt;Thank you kojic acid &amp; glutathion Dual&lt;br /&gt;To make u flawless</li>
    <li> Maybe I should have gotten a few of these because I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference. Also, it burned occasionally. I was using it in hopes of evening skin tone in my armpits but would irritate my skin the day after shaving them. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it correctly.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to everyone and the seller shiped fast too. I ordered on 12th,  got it on the 14th and i already see difference in skin tone. Will order from this seller again. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> Just saw tiny improvement for lighten my skin after two months using of one soap. Today I just placed another order for more soaps to see long term effect.</li>
    <li> I used that product one time. It worked for me so fast. I ordered again, it made my skin light and flawless. I recommend it for everybody.</li>
    <li> omg!!!!!!  this soap is amazing.  i just turned 50 and noticed my face had more blotches than ever.  my face also felt rough and oily while being exposed to the california sun daily.  its been approx. 2 weeks and i already referred this soap to my best friend.  after all these years where have this product been all my life.  i dont know what 50 is suppose to look like but most people do not believe i am.  everything disappeared fast.  my skin glow, no more dark blotches, no build oil build up.  the bumps arrive and gone in less than 2 days.  i usually do not give reviews but even to this day african americans have no solution for bad skin.  this is it.  this is the antidote.  my skin look so vibrant that i went back to a short hair style in which this style brings out my face. i dont feel 50, 60, 70.................i feel beautiful.  trust me the soap is a great price and lives up to its name, i just ordered 6 more bars. nice light clean smell, good lather.  if i can send a before and after pic....i will.  you wouldnt believe your eyes.</li>
    <li> I just received this soap yesterday 12 Nov.  I used it and the lathers were great....love that.  But it was a bit drying on my already drying winter skin.  But I will continue using it until it&#x27;s gone.  I want to give it a chance.  I always have my secret weapon for time like these, vitamin e oil.  I also read a review prior to ordering this product in which one review stated that it was an exfoliating property in the soap before you reap the benefits.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27; t recommend this product for discoloration or sun damaged spots because this product is not effective against that. I didn&#x27;t see any improvements. Could of just been the one I received, there&#x27;s no telling.</li>
    <li> It did just as it said it would. I like it!</li>
    <li> i have very hard skin so to speak. but this soap is strong i tried using it on my face but it was burning and uncomfortable. i used it on my body. i haven&#x27;t really seen any difference maybe i need to use it more often. it doesn&#x27;t last very long in about 2 wks its done. also the size u see on the web its much smaller than that. i thought i was getting a big soap disappointed. because when i saw it on the web i thought it was cheap for the size but when i got it i c y .</li>
    <li> Well, I truly enjoy using this soap.  You lather up quickly and rinse off just as fast.  The only place that I have been using my soap is on my face.  Just give me a two weeks and I shall email you back with the results. I&#x27;m back and a month has passed and the results are in.  My close friend, who does not know what special soap I&#x27;m using on my face keeps telling me that my face looks clearer and brighter. Do you think I should tell him about my secret beauty soap? Let him keep the compliments coming....</li>
    <li> I gave this product a rating of only 3 stars as a result of the soap is really strong and drying to the skin on my face, so I&#x27;m not sure if it really works or not. However, on the body even though it is still drying it&#x27;s not as bad. Also, I&amp;#34;m not sure if I would purchase again.  I stop using the soap after 7 days because it was just too drying and cause my skin to itch a lot and actually broke my skin out.  All the same, based on the reviews if your skin can take it you may want to give it a try unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly enjoying this product. Wish I would&#x27;ve known about 10 years ago... I turned 53 August 25, I already look 25.... using this product I look even younger.</li>
    <li> I tried this product looking for results.  Iam of a tan complexion with dark marks from sun and acne, this product did nothing for my skin  I used it for about a month and it wasn&#x27;t really that must of a difference.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only used it for about a month i don&#x27;t see any real progress though my skin has be prevented from getting darker and i do spend quite the time in the sun</li>
    <li> This soap works very well im spots are almost gone and i still have some soap left so when i finish it will be completely clear</li>
    <li> it was not good and skin became dry. not for sensitive people</li>
    <li> Yesterday the soap arrived and today is my first time using it. i got in the shower this morning, lathered the soap on my skin, and i left it on my skin for about seconds then rinsed it of. The first time i put it on my skin i didnt feel a burning sensation, the second time i put it on my skin i felt the burning on my chest; I  also washed my face with it and imediately my right cheek started to burn. After i got out the shower i did see a slight difference in my skin, it looked a little brighter but, the soap made my skin dry so... I just started using Palmers Skin Success Milk and its amazing it makes my skin feel smooth. I put the lotion on after i got out the shower while my skin was still wet. I think these two products will work well together and even my skin tone. The skin milk alone works great. I think my skin is just going to have to get used to the soap.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the product &amp; the price</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any result yet. But it&#x27;s a pretty good soap for cleaning my face and body. I give it 4 stars</li>
    <li> My skin is brown, rather was brown! Now it&#x27;s turning yellow! It&#x27;s really wierd!  It stings a little when I wash but my skin looks so fresh and creamy!</li>
    <li> After reading the  reviews one this soap, I decide to get it.  And this product really worked.  At first i did not notice my skin getting ligther untill my sister told.  I use the soap as instructed  just only using the lather.The soap is bit strong and has mirco exfoliating  on the orange side. You can feel the grains when you lather up the soap. Over all would say it a good soap.</li>
    <li> Clothing is very beautiful and actually as required and an existing image</li>
    <li> i love the product :)</li>
    <li> okay gradually seeing results but taking a longgggggggggggg time</li>
    <li> Just started using the soap so it will take some time to see how it works.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of letting this soap sit on my face in hopes that it would make this product work better.. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. It burns my skin when I leave it on for longer that 4 min. So now I just wash with this bar and rinse quickly with cool water. I will say that this soap does work!!! I&#x27;ve had acne discoloration for years now and it has literally brighten my skin and faded most of the brow scars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an effective whitening soap that do not irritate my skin..</li>
    <li> this soap does work like it said. help lighting you skin color or even out your skin tone. even out you dark color of your skin to. but you need to used it for 4 week to see the different between you skin color.</li>
    <li> I see changes and great develope on my skin want to order next time too and want to order for y daughter to</li>
    <li> this product does not work well. it only helps with acne bumps. but doesn&#x27;t really even your skin tone at all. its also not good for long term use, only short term.</li>
    <li> Leave on for 10 minutes or more and it brighten your skin and soften it too! I wish it was bigger cause it last 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and excellent product. Soap feel so smooth to the skin and you can feel whitening effect in just 3 days. Soap smell so good and I will definitely order this product to this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> it is very acoustic  very hot on the face.</li>
    <li> Good but to me didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would</li>
    <li> i saw nothing change about my skin after using the entire bar. I won&#x27;t buy again!! maybe its not strong enough or something!</li>
    <li> I love the soap so much my body feels very soft and I recommend to everyone to try it .</li>
    <li> i like it this soap my skin start getting white and my face.i dont have any problems or irretations by using this.</li>
    <li> A good soap! I would recommend it to other friends and family, especially those with long term and stubborn scars.</li>
    <li> It does not work for me thank</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness! I was so skeptical because other soaps like this never worked for me, but this thing is incredible. I&#x27;ve been using it every two days and my acne marks are fading. The giant black mark on the side of my face, has actually faded so much that at first I was very confused. Don&#x27;t expect this to bleach you or anything, it&#x27;s a good exfoliating soap and it does minimize acne marks, but if you&#x27;re looking to lighten your complexion, I&#x27;d suggest finding something else.</li>
    <li> lov it it so smute my face ?</li>
    <li> i read many reviews before to buy it, then I decided to try. I like it, this soap works in 5days only I could see by myself my skin brighter. What I can say is go for it.. IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> Worst Kojic acid soap. I used it regularly everyday twice a day for about 2 months on my arms. I just had a tan that I wanted to get rid of and it didnt even lighten my tan.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best but it works. It melts easily so store it in a cool dry place. It does lighten the skin. After a week, you should start seeing results or try something else. The koje san works better in my opinion</li>
    <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t lighten age spots or discolorations of the skin, but it does make your skin look and feel clean.</li>
    <li> Not that great. And it drys my skin and leave soup residue.</li>
    <li> Ok this is a strong soap it works! However reading the reviews people think whitening their skin is a overnight process then they down a product. Whitening or bleaching your skin is not a overnight or weekly thing. It&#x27;s a monthly and yearly process ok. It took MJ 10 years to achieve what he wanted to look like with his skin. You just have to put in the work you know within 6 weeks if a product is working or not everybody skin detail is different just like finger prints. But as for this product I rate it as a 9 on a scale to one to 10. You can&#x27;t leave this soap on no more than 3 minutes it has a burning effect . You definitely don&#x27;t want to  inflame your skin by this. Just try it ! If it works it works if not than go back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> This Soap Burn My Skin So Bad And Make Me Start To itch!!</li>
    <li> Not seeing any results, but I also don&#x27;t use daily. Use it on armpits. Does irritate the armpits if left on too long</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Product is good, got to me on time also. Im 100% satisfied</li>
    <li> Loved it!!! Enhances my complexion</li>
    <li> This soap is probably good with other people for me it just makes a lot of pimples on my back and my body itch I have been using it for one week i didnt even finish one bar but I&#x27;m having a bad experience with it already so I stop useing it. Its just not for me.</li>
    <li> Big hype...no results. Used it twice a day for a month and nothing noticable happened.  It is just expensive soap.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for my skin, but irritate it and leave it flaky and dry. Not a worthy product at all, save your money.</li>
    <li> It worked but also gave me acne, if you have naturally oily skin then it will most likely give you some breakouts.</li>
    <li> Dont work waste of money had it sent to a lab nothing like they said was in it its b.s big time dont buy!</li>
    <li> The soap is too strong. I dont recommend it for the face.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working just fine.  Now the rest of family is using it too so may need to reorder more soon.</li>
    <li> I ordered a lot of skin products , this soap was one of them , its called dual whitening however if that is what you are looking for , the soap dose not do any dual functions. Please safe your money.</li>
    <li> The pure orange kojic acid soap is far, far better. This is ok, and maybe a bit better if your skin is dry or sensitive. However, for me, the pure orange color one made my skin peel a little, and after a week it was glowing!  This will do for now, and when Ive used it up, it&#x27;s back to the orange color kojic acid bar for me.</li>
    <li> It smells good like oranges, it does dry out the skin but dugh it is a bleaching soap. Use lotion after shower people. Good product it also helped dry out my oily skin in which was needed for me. Recomended highly for good price but need a bigger bar it does go quickly.  but I use every shower daily</li>
    <li> This product does not lighten your skin. This is great for an exfoliating soap. It gets rid of all the dirt and dead skin left behind.</li>
    <li> I had scratch marks on my hands that disappeared within a week. I had dark marks on my neck that has dissapated significantly in weeks.</li>
    <li> Soap is good but for some reason it burned my skin not happy with my results I have black spots every where its just overwhelming</li>
    <li> I got this soap to brighten my face and my butt crack sorry tmi?  and ive used it twice and so far both look brighter . Its gentle yet gets me feeling and lookimg really clean. I turn the water off as I lather up and let it set for a minute or two. This is the first soap of its kind that I have got and may try another one that is natural like this one. Ill add photos of my face next monday.</li>
    <li> Product works as described.  Use it a few times a week.</li>
    <li> This  soap is amazing. My skin is moisturized and  has a brighter and glowing complexion. Not only has my  dark spots starting to fade,  its also has lighten dark spots on my  arm and my shoulders. I am so pleased with the results after only a week or so. I didnt expect  the results to be so  impressive. But I am very very  happy ,  will continue to  comment on the  results in the next  3 weeks and  months.  After buying,  Tri  Luma for $100,  vitamin c tablets, and  many dermatologists visit,  have  not given me such fast results. But this  soap has.  thank you thank you.</li>
    <li> It cleans pores very well, but you will need good moisture care. I did not experience peeling and my skin had light fading.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap cause I heard of other reviews that it works.  And that it lights your skin, that didn&#x27;t happen for me.  But what I noticed is that it really cleans your skin really good and dry you out. At the same time but overall, I like the soap for really just for removing oil and dirt from the skin</li>
    <li> I thought you would see a difference but my spots still look the same i have been using it everyday for about two months.</li>
    <li> Definitely gives a deep clean, but as for the whitening affects- not so potent</li>
    <li> it works.  it leaves your skin smooth and lightened.  for better and faster results,  use with skin lightening cream. results in 2 weeks REALLY .</li>
    <li> Very drying to the skin but does leave it squeaky clean break outs as well 6 pimples had not had a zit in years just a few blackheads on nose area will not buy again. Just cellophane package no info at all percentages ingredients except on Amazon.  Won&#x27;t use this company again .</li>
    <li> I had red marks all over my legs due to an allergic reaction to a laser hair removal treatment that ended up welting my skin. After my skin had healed, the red marks turned into dark marks. I was too embarrassed to wear shorts because of the marks all over my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and found that Kojic Acid was a safe lightening agent which is how I stumbled upon this soap. I am so happy I did because after just a day of washing my legs with this soap, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. Every night I lathered the soap on my legs, let it stay on for a good 10 minutes, then I would wash it off with my loofah sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a month of every day use and another order of this soap for my dark marks to fully fade away, but they&#x27;re gone!! This soap has truly saved my Summer and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I highly recommend this soap for those that have recent dark marks on their skin that they need faded.</li>
    <li> Shipping was at a snails pace on this product. I was beginning to wonder if I was ever going to receive it.</li>
    <li> It seems to have faded hand sunspots a little.  The bar has gone down fast.</li>
    <li> The soap smells very good however it did not work for me. I was using it to lighten up my dark ankles but it did clean my skin very well. It leaves my skin dry. I will try another brand maybe in the future.</li>
    <li> it needs to be stronger like an extra strength version</li>
    <li> The picture of this product from the seller can be misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, you are only getting 1 bar of soap and NOT 2 bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the stated price you are better off getting 2 or more bars from other buyers.  Just thought I&#x27;d bring your attention to the oversight that I had.  Thanks</li>
    <li> still using it,waiting for result</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I think maybe you have to use it long term. And I am not willing to spend 8 dollars for a small bar of soap.</li>
    <li> After using the second bar I noticed my blemishes slowly beginning to clear up. I have been using this product for over Four months now and there is definitely an improvement in the condition do my skin.</li>
    <li> I dont get any result of using this product. Not good for my face. I use it on my body</li>
    <li> As in my previous post, I mentioned that this soap is far more potent than I thought.  Do not use warm or hot water to open pores before using this soap.  Do not rub the lather into your skin.  Do not leave on until it burns.  This soap does all of the exfoliating and pore-opening for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have burned my skin several times already.  I also ended up blistering one of my cheeks.  I cannot stress further that you should lather gently and rinse off within a few minutes.  If you do burn your skin, the burn will fade in a week or so, but you&#x27;ll have to live with it until then.  Otherwise, this soap has significantly improved the texture of my skin, and I wish I had known about it years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must wear sunscreen, as this soap removes protective layers of your skin, and could possibly raise the possibility of contracting skin cancers from harmful UV rays.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because the soap turns orange in color when the water hits it. The soap is sticky.</li>
    <li> This product did make my skin peel but made it worse after. Maybe it was just too strong for my skin.</li>
    <li> GREAT I LOVE THIS PRODUCT WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I would rate it a 3. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for sensitive skin. I used it on my face and it burned me too the point where my face got darker and very dry. A pound of Vaseline every day recovered me lol. BUTTT the good news is, I always dealt with dark areas like my knees, inner thighs, etc.... I used it on one of those areas and my skin actually got lighter and more clearer. It works welllll on areas like that. You might even see results within the one day you use it.....but in order to get fullllll results and satisfaction, you have to use it at least everyday. Great product though.</li>
    <li> It was good the first day after 2 days the product burnt my skin abd i stopped to use it</li>
    <li> Its been couple weeks since I&#x27;m using it so far I don&#x27;t see any change</li>
    <li> Used about 4 of these and it didn&#x27;t really work as far as whitening my skin. It was an ok soap.</li>
    <li> I like this soap, works well. Will dry out your skin so moisturizer is a must, as well as sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I got it on time actually before anticipated but it melts fast like literally I&#x27;ve only used it twice scarcely at that nd its going super quick I keep it in a cool dry place so a little disappointed with that. Dont know if its working haven&#x27;t seen a difference. I&#x27;ll c before the bars gone if there&#x27;s a difference</li>
    <li> I love it! Works really well! It burns a little after 3 minutes, but you will definitely tell the difference after the first use.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few weeks. I feel mild irritation when using the soap but I don&#x27;t keep it on my skin long. Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
    <li> This is a great producnt I would recommend to everyone, it softens, tones, and best of all it clears skins discoloration, and gives you a glowing skin, for me the sun has causes discoloration on my face and hands, but after using this product for two weeks I see drastic results, my skin is restore to it original state and even brighter, the only shortfall is the bar is smaller than an average soap.</li>
    <li> great value however not very much difference in change of darkening. can&#x27;t ask for much as it is inexpensive. did make slight difference</li>
    <li> I have noticed some lightening on the spots for which I purchased this for, mostly my under arms. I&#x27;d say the product lasts about a month with regular use, but I&#x27;m seeing it work so I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is very good and helps my skin to stay lighter after spending time in the sun.  I do not have any allergic reaction to the soap.I intend to purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> be careful to follow instructions when using this soap. The slightest mistake can leave you burned similar to a TCA cosmetic chemical peel.</li>
    <li> Came on time don&#x27;t know a major difference yet but haven&#x27;t used it long but my face definitely feels cleaned.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth it. You get what you pay for. i used it faithfully and nothing. Don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> i bought this soap last 4 months ago-when my first used it seems like nothing changes so i decide to not continue to use this.And just this week i try to use again..and i spend my time to leave bubbles and  soak for 10 mins or so...and after that...i used a loofah scrub to all over my body and i just did it twice that was 1 in the night and 1 in the morning..and i was surprised when i found out my skin was start to peeled off..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way,those people have been try to used this soap and found out like something white flakes on your skin and you feel like a dryness...just dont worry about that..because thats a a dead skin and in few days you will have a smooth skin..just continue to apply a any lotion which you like..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and im going to order it again.</li>
    <li> I just started with it. So far so good love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> I only used it for about a week but the first time I used it I was shocked. This is probably only for me but when I used it a lot of my acne has disappeared and my pores lessened. My face seems smoother and I don&#x27;t have a problem with it at all. It doesn&#x27;t make my face too dry.</li>
    <li> i used kojic soap before and i was comfortable using it and then one time i saw this product and i thought it is better than kojic soap. so i was like &#x27; i will try this&amp;#34;. i started using it on may 5, 2014 up to a couple of days until i noticed that something is wrong. it turns out from what i expected to the worst. my face gets more dry and it stings like it burns. the half clear of the soap is fine but the orange half is really rough like there is a beads or something that is really rough that causes to scratch and leaves sting on my face every time i used it. i ordered 6 pieces of them but now i just wanted to send the remaining back to the seller. it was horrible. i already throw the return label that is why i dont know how to return it back again. i need help;thank you.</li>
    <li> Just purchase this soap yesterday...So I&#x27;m just waiting to use it but how I found out about this soap was YouTube I was looking for some to get rid of my acne marks off my face and body  :-( so I seen this soap and seen that it&#x27;s helps my problem but truly I am scared cause on here I see bad reviews that&#x27;s why I only bought one bar and a cheap one with free shipping lol, Anywho I will post another review and take before and after pics to help other that&#x27;s looking into this product but wish me luck</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not much changes</li>
    <li> it is nice I can see changes quickly</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, only thing it makes your skin peel NOT WHITEN!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase it arrived on time and it was what I purchased.</li>
    <li> I believe that Kojic acid was discovered in Japan.  I have been using this soap on my face daily,mornings and evenings for two years.  The dark spots and fine lines are gone and it made the pores smaller.&lt;br /&gt;The price is so reasonable, last a long time and does a great job.  GREAT SOAP.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to everyone. The product really works on any types of skin. It brightens any discoloration. Good product</li>
    <li> I have used two bars of soap already. It has continued to keep my face and body soft, smooth, and clear. I will definitelly keep on using this soap.</li>
    <li> Not only did the soap make no difference, but it was disgusting. The soap smelled very bad and then I discovered that there was a bug stuck in the middle of it once I had used it enough to wear it out. That was so gross. A BUG. Completely dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> It was all broken when i got it i want a refund</li>
    <li> no different then the original soap just dried my skin out more, going back to the original kojic soap</li>
    <li> Live, this is great. It works,  just give it some time, nothing works over night.  Also you should use a heavy moisture after each use to prevent itching and or rashing.I prefer to use cocobutter (the hard thick one in the jar,not the lotion or cream) you can also try vaseline. Lotion will not help in this case. I would recommend taking brakes from using the soap. I would use it ever other day or use it 3 days out of the week maybe twice a day until your skin get use to it. Leave it on for about 30 seconds or at least until you feel the first tingle. Rinse it off in cool to cold water. Never use warm or hot water.Use a glycerin natural soap in between. Keep your sheets and pillow cases clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sha D.&lt;br /&gt;Medical/Cosmetologist</li>
    <li> I love the clean feeling of my skin after washing with this soap, but was disappointed that peeling was very mild, not as great as papaya soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is average. I didn&#x27;t see any changes. I guess it all boils down to where it is purchased because other kojic acid soaps worked fine.</li>
    <li> there is no good soap nothing happen to me. I mean no strong bright skin or it not help (nope)</li>
    <li> This soap is fairly mild,I soap up and leave it on for 2 minutes or so,then rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;I skip a couple of days,then use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I have light skin anyway,have been using this soap to help clear rash on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;Careful on face area,use sparingly,you will feel it,then rinse off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the soap and my dead skin is going ,but still i dint get full result,&amp; i started only few week so im using to see the result very soon</li>
    <li> Not good for sensitive skin. Too strong for me.</li>
    <li> VERY USEFUL ,AND IT HAS DONE WONDERFUL,AS I HAVE SOME BLACK SPOTS ON MY FACE THIS HAS DIMINISHED IT ,SO HOPE TO BBUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> Love this soap.....it&#x27;s really good</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work only thing it did was gave me dry skin ,which burned like hell</li>
    <li> Its good and noticeable result but its not suit to my Skin. I feel to much itchy after bath and very dry skin. I believe its depend on skin tone.</li>
    <li> i aam very pleased with the performance of this product,after using it for  a week,my skin s  begining to even tone and my pigmentation r going away,it has also lighten my face n neck but i use it with clear essence fade cream,my main reason for buying this product s to lighten my sun tan arms,my arms hv not completely lightend yet but i can see improvement.</li>
