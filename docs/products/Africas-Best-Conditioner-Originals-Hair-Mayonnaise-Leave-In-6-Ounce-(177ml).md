      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>i like this product i just like the one that washes out better.  </li>
      <li>I may try it again to make sure, but otherwise it&#x27;s not my fav product.</li>
      <li>Perfectly curled hydrated and bouncy coils with absolutely no frizz!</li>
      <li>I do roller sets with this as my leave in with with a little evoo splashed in..and it rocks!I have tried others,but this works the best and its cheap!</li>
      <li>my hair is strong, no shedding or breakage and manageable.</li>
      <li>One of the best leave in conditioners for black hair that I have tried.</li>
      <li>This is such a great product - works well, smells great,INCREDIBLE value for money, and ships free with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the result is FABULOUS.</li>
      <li>This bottle will last me months and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this great in a while.</li>
      <li>:) It could be more reasonably priced, but I did choose to buy it.</li>
      <li>come quickly though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Luckily for me, I was just given a sample to try it.</li>
      <li>I have tried it as a moisturizer on wet hair: a real mess,it had a gel like feeling and it just sat on my hair, made my ends incredibly tangled.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, LOVE how it nurtured my hair without making it feel greasy, and that it has so few ingredients.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the quick shipping!</li>
      <li>simply put, this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>I use this on my relaxed hair as a leave-in after washes and it makes my hair soft and able to detangle.</li>
      <li>my biggest problem was findng something to make my natural hair softer and more manageable.</li>
      <li>Yet if you add certain oils or hair dressing oils it builds up quickly or don&#x27;t agree with the leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>recommend to everybody and would certainly buy again!</li>
      <li>leaves my coarse hair smooth, shiny and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>I ended up opening it and putting it in my hair as I would with gel or hair lotion except I found that you don&#x27;t need much to work on your whole head</li>
      <li>Use lightly, after you deep condition to repair and keep hair moisturized.</li>
      <li>Really, I should be making it on my own, but I am lazy.</li>
      <li>It does not have your hair super shiny but does leave a soft, natural shine.</li>
      <li>i would highly recommend this to any and everyone.</li>
      <li>This product has almost completely restored my original hair, and i have only been using it for a couple of weeks.  </li>
      <li>Glad amazon has it as its hard to find&lt;br /&gt;outside</li>
      <li>Immediate Results as far as softness an manageability &amp; strengthening.  </li>
      <li>I have 4 a natural hair.</li>
      <li>It also leaves my hair soft.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s thick and to the top of my shoulders , I rubbed it in my hair and combed through and it immediately made my hair soft and manageable and conditions</li>
      <li>My hair is relaxed and when it became dry, I didn&#x27;t want to weigh it down with a greasy product but wasn&#x27;t sure what a liquid would do</li>
      <li>I love this stuff for my hair, but cannot afford to purchase such a small bottle at such a high price.</li>
      <li>At first when I started to use it , it left my hair so soft and straight then after a while it started to leave my hair puffy and so soft but don&#x27;t like to waste money</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve used in a long time that has actually WORKED to control the frizz.</li>
      <li>no regrets what so ever.</li>
      <li>i use it right after washing my hair and daily for moisturizing and sealing after with jamaican black castor.</li>
      <li>I leave it in to set, to twist, to blow-dry, to flat iron, and I always have the same result: silky, soft, shiny, healthy-looking hair.</li>
      <li>I use a dime size of this all over and a little on the places that frizz more, then I style as usual (mouse) and let it air-dry or diffuse if in a rush.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this that makes it work while other products dont, but for some reason it does.  </li>
<li> and i refuse to change to anything other product.</li>
<li> but I even use it on dry hair instead of gel to tame my hair for slick looks.  </li>
<li> I do not use after trying a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> this one seems to make my hair seem heavy.</li>
<li> so I used just a small amount of this leave-in treatment.</li>
<li> but when it got finished i was too lazy to go to my beauty supply warehouse and got this from a pharmacy close by.</li>
<li> Hate gross.</li>

    <li> One of the best leave in conditioners for black hair that I have tried. Yet if you add certain oils or hair dressing oils it builds up quickly or don&#x27;t agree with the leave in conditioner. Use lightly, after you deep condition to repair and keep hair moisturized. Love it. Best leave in for the price.</li>
    <li> My hair was really really curly, but then I damaged it from straightening it everyday, and it became wavy-like.  This product has almost completely restored my original hair, and i have only been using it for a couple of weeks.  I have tried other, similar products with similar ingredients from other brands, even more expensive ones, but this is the only one that gave me results.  I don&#x27;t know what it is about this that makes it work while other products dont, but for some reason it does.  It also works as just a regular leave-in conditioner.  I used to buy $30 salon brand leave-ins, but this is cheaper and better.</li>
    <li> Does really good in moisture climates</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and its the best I&#x27;ve ever found.&lt;br /&gt;This leaves my coarse hair smooth, shiny and hydrated.  Glad amazon has it as its hard to find&lt;br /&gt;outside ethnic neighborhoods.</li>
    <li> I &lt;3 this.stuff!I have 3c/4a relaxed lower back length hair.I do roller sets with this as my leave in with with a little evoo splashed in..and it rocks!I have tried others,but this works the best and its cheap!</li>
    <li> My hair is relaxed and when it became dry, I didn&#x27;t want to weigh it down with a greasy product but wasn&#x27;t sure what a liquid would do so I used just a small amount of this leave-in treatment. I could instantly feel the results and the next day I could see the results after unwrapping my hair. I now use it nightly on my ends,  seal with argan oil, then wrap. Slendid!</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is absolutely perfect. I love the smell and the feel, and I can use it in my hair for just about any kind of styling. I leave it in to set, to twist, to blow-dry, to flat iron, and I always have the same result: silky, soft, shiny, healthy-looking hair. It works miracles and I&#x27;m soo happy I use it :)</li>

THIS IS EXCELLENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve used in a long time that has actually WORKED to control the frizz. I have hair just below my shoulder, curly/wavy- I use a dime size of this all over and a little on the places that frizz more, then I style as usual (mouse) and let it air-dry or diffuse if in a rush. the result is FABULOUS. Perfectly curled hydrated and bouncy coils with absolutely no frizz! This bottle will last me months and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this great in a while. I recommend it for women with curly/wavy and dry hair.</li>

    <li> At first when I started to use it , it left my hair so soft and straight then after a while it started to leave my hair puffy and so soft but don&#x27;t like to waste money so I&#x27;m going to finish the bottle and I&#x27;m moving on</li>
    <li> Hate gross. I do not use after trying a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did come quickly though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not reorder</li>
    <li> i like this product i just like the one that washes out better.  this one seems to make my hair seem heavy. so, i wash it out.</li>
    <li> I use this on my relaxed hair as a leave-in after washes and it makes my hair soft and able to detangle. I had to restock when I ran out.</li>
    <li> If your hair feels damaged by any means, coloring, relaxing, etc, then you need too try this.  It helps stop breakage and detangles nicely.  And with this product, your hair doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;resistant\\&quot; to it.  It will work time after time.  The best time to use it is after you wash your hair but I even use it on dry hair instead of gel to tame my hair for slick looks.  It is very different than the wash out hair mayonnaise, even from this company.  It does not have your hair super shiny but does leave a soft, natural shine.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave-in conditioner.  It keeps my hair nice and easy to manage all day.  Has a great shine to it also.</li>
    <li> The leave in conditioner gives my hair the body and poof it needs. It also leaves my hair soft. I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my hair, but cannot afford to purchase such a small bottle at such a high price.</li>
    <li> I have 4 a natural hair. I have tried it as a moisturizer on wet hair: a real mess,it had a gel like feeling and it just sat on my hair, made my ends incredibly tangled.  Luckily for me, I was just given a sample to try it. This is definitely not for me,ever again.</li>
    <li> As soon as I got home and got the package I had to try this out, it smells really good without even peeling the plastic seal off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to wait until I needed it to use it but I couldn&#x27;t resist so I ended up opening it and putting it in my hair as I would with gel or hair lotion except I found that you don&#x27;t need much to work on your whole head and I have a lot of hair, it&#x27;s thick and to the top of my shoulders , I rubbed it in my hair and combed through and it immediately made my hair soft and manageable and conditions well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everybody and would certainly buy again!</li>
    <li> simply put, this stuff is amazing. i used to use cantu shea butter leave in but when it got finished i was too lazy to go to my beauty supply warehouse and got this from a pharmacy close by. no regrets what so ever. my biggest problem was findng something to make my natural hair softer and more manageable. i have been using this for months now and i refuse to change to anything other product. i use it right after washing my hair and daily for moisturizing and sealing after with jamaican black castor. my hair is strong, no shedding or breakage and manageable. i would highly recommend this to any and everyone.</li>
