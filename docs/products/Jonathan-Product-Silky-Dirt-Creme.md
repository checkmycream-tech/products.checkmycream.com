      <li>Easy to work with, leaves hair shinny and has a wonderful scent.  </li>
      <li>Genetics win out!, but If there were perfect chemical combinations that would magically give us wonderful hair - Jonathan has come as close to them as possible with Dirt.</li>

      <li>Which ya better get for the price!</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Love Jonathan&#x27;s Silky Dirt!</li>
      <li>It gives me just enough grit so my hair looks awesome AND IT SMELLS SOOOO GOOD!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
      <li>After the first use, he came out of the bathroom and said \\&quot;This is the greatest hair product I&#x27;ve ever used!\\&quot;, and has used it every day since.</li>
      <li>Works very nice in my hair, makes it shiny and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I originally sought out the dirt texturizing wax, as I read tons of great reviews on it.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite hair products.  </li>
      <li>Have reordered many times</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I tried this thinking it would give control with more shine</li>
      <li>Same great product in a travel size!</li>
      <li>I think I love this product.</li>
      <li>Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I think I like this even better than their paste version.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely fabulous!  </li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>:) Rock your fabulous locks!</li>
      <li>It may work better on curly hair.  </li>
      <li>This is the perfect product; I only hope they never discontinue it!</li>
      <li>Although I do have to say - if you buy it direct you get FREE 2-day shipping and FREE samples, along with awesome customer service!</li>
      <li>I wanted to jump online and review this product after the first time I used it, but I held off a while to make sure I gave it a good run first.</li>
      <li>I use to watch the reality show that followed Jonathan &amp; his huge ego.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say the wax is probably perfect for guys and girls with short hair that they like to spike up or really freeze in place.</li>
      <li>My hair is super fine</li>
      <li>: You won&#x27;t want significant others running fingers through your hair as it&#x27;s a bit sticky</li>
      <li>Silky dirt &amp; Dirt smell lovely &amp; if emulsified in hands first</li>
      <li>The spray is great for those with a bit of length, or for touchups/flyaways, and the silky dirt is excellent for those with long and/or thick hair that needs to be mellowed out.</li>
      <li>The mini tube lasted me weeks before I purchased a full sizer.</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair &amp; this shapes, forms &amp; holds the curls but smells nice &amp; leaves my hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
      <li>Needs to keep making, its the best smelling product i have ever used, and a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>Maybe on short hair the paste would be better.</li>
      <li>This the first time I have ever used Jonathan Product.</li>
      <li>When I flat iron it, it&#x27;s glossier and straightens out easier, and my hair feels more protected from the heat.</li>
      <li>The result is that it&#x27;s pretty much the way your hair might be if you didn&#x27;t wash it every day; I do wash mine every day</li>
      <li>Both have a pleasant smell, but this seems to work better to just put a little in your hand to push down a cowlick.  </li>
      <li>The Silky Dirt is PERFECT for long, thick hair like mine.</li>
      <li>I got a free sample of the straightening cream with my order, so maybe I&#x27;ll report back on that one too!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed the benefits of this product, as it has left my hair soft, with balanced moisture.</li>
      <li>- i only use it for special occasions though.</li>
      <li>more feminine scent (pulling vanilla), slight sheen (I prefer matte), price&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t melt right away and allow my hair to instantly cook into crunchy straw like most other products do.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re golden the next day.</li>
      <li>: No buildup, need to use MINIMAL product, lasting hold, can revamp later in the day, good for texture&lt;br /&gt;Moderate:</li>
      <li>Well this stuff really is a good investment because while it&#x27;s very pricey - you really do only need a very small amount.</li>
      <li>By far my #1 hair product!</li>
      <li>My husband has abolutely fallen in love with the spray and then uses a small amount of the paste to lock it all in at the end.</li>
      <li>The wax is a bit too tacky for full use on real long, thick hair, but great for finishing touches and flyaways, as is a little of the spray.</li>
      <li>I have thick, straight, fine hair.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as Jonathan&#x27;s Dirt texturizing paste.  </li>
      <li>This big bottle will last months, and I would have bought three bottles of whatever else in that time, so I believe it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
      <li>The hard stuff in the little tub seems better to me.  </li>
      <li>A little pricey (but much cheaper than anywhere else if you can even find it)</li>

<li> The hard stuff in the little tub seems better to me.  </li>
<li> A little pricey (but much cheaper than anywhere else if you can even find it)</li>
<li> They say you only need a very small amount, which I always promptly ignore, because no matter what they say - I need a big blob for the left side and another big blob for the right.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d been searching for something to dirty up my hair for years, after my favorite mousse (Pantene Texturize Mousse Wax) was discontinued.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this for years on my very short hair; it&#x27;s terrific and gives enough control without being sticky or heavy.  </li>
<li> It goes on a little &#x27;sticky&#x27; &amp; at first seemed to tame the frizz</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to tame my wild hair and nothing ever worked.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re similar to me, get the other Dirt product or the creme by Bumble and Bumble.</li>
<li> When I blow dry it, it&#x27;s straighter and smoother.</li>
<li> I use this on dry hair before I style with a curling iron.</li>
<li> and actually easier than getting rid of &amp;#34;bed-head&amp;#34; any other way!)</li>
<li> Based on reviews, I expected it to be a lot &#x27;lighter&#x27; but to control frizz.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m male and have dark hair with medium texture and a slight receding hairline.</li>
<li> The silky dirt is not as thick as the classic dirt and isn&#x27;t as heavy.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> I apply a little bit in my hair when it is wet with other products I use.</li>
<li> Even a small amount makes my hair feel flat and &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;... gave it away to a friend</li>
<li> Mine is relatively long - about 6&amp;#34; past my shoulders.</li>
<li> This stuff seemed too wet and heavy.</li>
<li> No matter how little I use,  this stuff comes off sticky where as the other didn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> but within a half hour or so of drying, it frizzed up.  </li>
<li> I plan to mix a little of  this creme into my bottle of leave-in conditioner for an anti-frizz formula that works for me.</li>
<li> I have long, very thick, course hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 5 years.  </li>
<li> It calms it down without coming out heavy or dirty looking.</li>
<li> They are usually heavy,weigh the hair down &amp; are worst the next day.</li>
<li> not only did it make your hair feel dirty, the scent was not good either...should be called Dirty Dirt..</li>
<li> Hated this stuff..</li>

    <li> Hated this stuff..not only did it make your hair feel dirty, the scent was not good either...should be called Dirty Dirt..UGH</li>
    <li> I tried this thinking it would give control with more shine but it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as Jonathan&#x27;s Dirt texturizing paste.  This stuff seemed too wet and heavy. It may work better on curly hair.  I have thick, straight, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Needs to keep making, its the best smelling product i have ever used, and a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m male and have dark hair with medium texture and a slight receding hairline. This is a very nice product BUT I prefer the Dirt Texture Paste for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: No buildup, need to use MINIMAL product, lasting hold, can revamp later in the day, good for texture&lt;br /&gt;Moderate: more feminine scent (pulling vanilla), slight sheen (I prefer matte), price&lt;br /&gt;Con: You won&#x27;t want significant others running fingers through your hair as it&#x27;s a bit sticky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product if you have longer, texturized or curly hair. If you&#x27;re similar to me, get the other Dirt product or the creme by Bumble and Bumble.</li>
    <li> I think I like this even better than their paste version.  Both have a pleasant smell, but this seems to work better to just put a little in your hand to push down a cowlick.  And being a creme instead of a paste, it seems easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Love Jonathan&#x27;s Silky Dirt!</li>
    <li> I use to watch the reality show that followed Jonathan &amp; his huge ego. I can&#x27;t begin to say how obnoxious I find people with an ego,he&#x27;s tops! I will not buy/shop from these type of people,that said,I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of balms,texturizing pastes,etc. They are usually heavy,weigh the hair down &amp; are worst the next day. Silky dirt &amp; Dirt smell lovely &amp; if emulsified in hands first,then applied... You&#x27;re golden the next day. These products are thee BEST!</li>
    <li> Even a small amount makes my hair feel flat and &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;... gave it away to a friend and she didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Great product for my curly frizzy hair. Their shampoo and conditioner is great also.  I recommend this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> The hard stuff in the little tub seems better to me.  No matter how little I use,  this stuff comes off sticky where as the other didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use the TINIEST amount After blow drying and it keeps everything in place with no hassle.</li>
    <li> I wanted to jump online and review this product after the first time I used it, but I held off a while to make sure I gave it a good run first. I have long, very thick, course hair. I&#x27;ve tried everything to tame my wild hair and nothing ever worked. It just resists the product and puffs back up into waves and frizzies. I originally sought out the dirt texturizing wax, as I read tons of great reviews on it. So I ordered the set that comes with mini sizes of all three dirt products. The Dirt texturizing wax, Spray Dirt, and Silky Dirt. They&#x27;re all great! My husband has abolutely fallen in love with the spray and then uses a small amount of the paste to lock it all in at the end. After the first use, he came out of the bathroom and said \\&quot;This is the greatest hair product I&#x27;ve ever used!\\&quot;, and has used it every day since. The wax is a bit too tacky for full use on real long, thick hair, but great for finishing touches and flyaways, as is a little of the spray. The Silky Dirt is PERFECT for long, thick hair like mine. They say you only need a very small amount, which I always promptly ignore, because no matter what they say - I need a big blob for the left side and another big blob for the right. Well this stuff really is a good investment because while it&#x27;s very pricey - you really do only need a very small amount. The mini tube lasted me weeks before I purchased a full sizer. This big bottle will last months, and I would have bought three bottles of whatever else in that time, so I believe it&#x27;s worth the cost. I will testify that no product I have tried in 20+ years has ever tamed my mane like this stuff does. It calms it down without coming out heavy or dirty looking. When I blow dry it, it&#x27;s straighter and smoother. When I flat iron it, it&#x27;s glossier and straightens out easier, and my hair feels more protected from the heat. It doesn&#x27;t melt right away and allow my hair to instantly cook into crunchy straw like most other products do. Genetics win out!, but If there were perfect chemical combinations that would magically give us wonderful hair - Jonathan has come as close to them as possible with Dirt. I&#x27;d say the wax is probably perfect for guys and girls with short hair that they like to spike up or really freeze in place. The spray is great for those with a bit of length, or for touchups/flyaways, and the silky dirt is excellent for those with long and/or thick hair that needs to be mellowed out. I got a free sample of the straightening cream with my order, so maybe I&#x27;ll report back on that one too! Although I do have to say - if you buy it direct you get FREE 2-day shipping and FREE samples, along with awesome customer service! Which ya better get for the price! :) Rock your fabulous locks!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Just a dab will do ya :D</li>
    <li> My hair is super fine and I like to use this silky dirt to give my hair some texture. I apply a little bit in my hair when it is wet with other products I use. I also use this silky dirt after I curl my hair and I am styling my hair with my fingers. It helps to set the style.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and it always gives me just the look I want</li>
    <li> Same great product in a travel size!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find anything as good.</li>
    <li> I think I love this product. I&#x27;d been searching for something to dirty up my hair for years, after my favorite mousse (Pantene Texturize Mousse Wax) was discontinued. You&#x27;d think I would have started with a product actually called Dirt. I use this on dry hair before I style with a curling iron. It gives me just enough grit so my hair looks awesome AND IT SMELLS SOOOO GOOD! My hair smells like cookies. I also bought the Dirt Texturizing Paste, but I prefer the creme. Maybe on short hair the paste would be better. Mine is relatively long - about 6&amp;#34; past my shoulders.</li>
    <li> This cr&amp;egrave;me is amazing!!!!  Easy to work with, leaves hair shinny and has a wonderful scent.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This the first time I have ever used Jonathan Product. I ordered this product based on the benefits and reviews written online. I have enjoyed the benefits of this product, as it has left my hair soft, with balanced moisture.</li>
    <li> not for my type of hair or i am not using enough bought this based on the fact i used dirt when my hair was short</li>
    <li> A little pricey (but much cheaper than anywhere else if you can even find it) - i only use it for special occasions though. Great stuff - not sticky, doesn&#x27;t smell girly,easy to manage. I would get this again when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. I have naturally wavy hair &amp; this shapes, forms &amp; holds the curls but smells nice &amp; leaves my hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
    <li> Use it after every wash for texture!</li>
    <li> Been a believer of using Jonathan Products for a while now. By far my #1 hair product!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have reordered many times</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 5 years.  It&#x27;s absolutely fabulous!  It holds my curls and makes it bouncy and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being sticky or greasy.</li>
    <li> I have loved this product since it came out.  Works very nice in my hair, makes it shiny and smooth.  Love!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair products.  The silky dirt is not as thick as the classic dirt and isn&#x27;t as heavy.  This is absolutely your product if you don&#x27;t want that heavy and crunchy hair feel or look.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews, I expected it to be a lot &#x27;lighter&#x27; but to control frizz.  It goes on a little &#x27;sticky&#x27; &amp; at first seemed to tame the frizz but within a half hour or so of drying, it frizzed up.  I manage that by applying a leave-in conditioner.  I plan to mix a little of  this creme into my bottle of leave-in conditioner for an anti-frizz formula that works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years on my very short hair; it&#x27;s terrific and gives enough control without being sticky or heavy.  The result is that it&#x27;s pretty much the way your hair might be if you didn&#x27;t wash it every day; I do wash mine every day (it&#x27;s so short that it&#x27;s no problem at all and actually easier than getting rid of &amp;#34;bed-head&amp;#34; any other way!) and need something to give it a bit of body and make if hold its &amp;#34;shape.&amp;#34;  This is the perfect product; I only hope they never discontinue it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It gives my hair volume without stickiness and smells great. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Great and timely service.</li>
