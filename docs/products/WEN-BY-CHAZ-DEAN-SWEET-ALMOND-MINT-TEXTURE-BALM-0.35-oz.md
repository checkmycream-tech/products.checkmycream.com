<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice product - I like how to apply it and it works!</li>
    <li> I love WEN stuff, works great and good for my hair!</li>
    <li> Love the convenient size of this item, wanted to try a different fragrance but did not want to pay for the larger size,  these things tend to last forever. Great deal on the price.</li>
    <li> I have looked at the hair care products on the store shelves, and cannot find anything similar to Wen&#x27;s texturizing balm.</li>
    <li> The is a tiny amount of product and I really never used it since the cleaning conditioner was such a failure.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m afro-american &amp; i have the nappy hair to prove it. i&#x27;m always lookin for a non-greasy hair cream to add moisture to my relaxed hair. i found that the wen texture balm was nice but i used most of the roll-on on my 1st &amp; only use. unforturnatlly i will not be buying this product or any other wen product. it&#x27;s just not for me...</li>
    <li> Wen is a great product for sure.  Especially the cleansers. This balm is good as well but no better than other balms in my opinion.  I would probably not buy this again just because I can get the same results with less money.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this if you have natural african american/black hair.... Doesnt work on a perm either.. Has absolutely no hold.. Garbage if you ask me</li>
    <li> My hair is smooth, not frizzy.  This is the only wen product I use now.  The conditioning cleanser made my hair&lt;br /&gt;heavy and greasy.</li>
    <li> I have a short soft Afro and humidity is always a problem but I used it around&lt;br /&gt;my edges I love the hold yet a natural texture is still achieved.</li>
    <li> You need very little of this to add definition, shine and texture to your hands!  Works nicely as a cuticle conditioner too!</li>
    <li> Great!!!! Love this product. Will buy more asap. Great price. Usually costs much more anywhere else. Makes ur hair smell so great, soft, and managable. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my wavy hair! Defines the waves just right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to it. So far, I like it, but I&#x27;m not crazy in love with it. I have 4C natural hair and I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything to my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with Hair One cleanser and another Wen styling product.  If I was still using conventional shampoo, I would definitely have a need for a product like this due to frizziness, fly-aways, and dry ends.  But with Wen, and Wen-like (Hair One) shampoo, a product like this isn&#x27;t even necessary.  Still, I will hold on to it for times that I can&#x27;t cleanse with Wen (at the gym, hotel, etc.)  Wen makes excellent products, and I&#x27;m sure this one is good, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really bummed this product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have thinning, very dry, wavy, frizzy hair and was hoping this would get rid of the frizziness and moisturize my hair at the same time but instead it felt more like a sticky ointment all over my hair that didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair but weighed it down. I&#x27;m really not sure why it got such great reviews! ? I guess, I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for the right product.</li>
    <li> Luv this product. Never tried Wen before, enjoyed watching Jeff Lewis get his hair cut by Chad a few years ago. Bought this on a recommendation from a friend. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I have course relaxed hair, this makes it style easily. I used it as lip gloss in a pinch too. I have used it both ways, swiping on my hands as suggested.  Then as a stick, targeting a specific area. Give it a chance, I think you might be surprised.</li>
    <li> I love this! So glad I could find it here. Makes my frizzing hair calm and looking great. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Product was just to heavy for my hair, I am sure this product is great for a shorter style. Texture is heavy</li>
    <li> I like the way this product textures my hair, however not as happy with the way I have to apply it.  It is like a deodorant stick so you have to smear it on your hands and takes getting used to that.  The positive about that is that you don&#x27;t use very much of it at a time and the way it works you really don&#x27;t want to use very much.  Maybe that is why it is set up to apply like that, but I still like it.</li>
    <li> This sticky, stiff produce seems to have little use for me. I read the instruction of wear to apply it. Why in the world to a fresh hairdo apply this sticky stuff that seems to pull down the curl. It is too stiff. I use some different paste products and this is the worse I have even used. This sure cannot be used to add shine either. It just does not apply to the hair well as it is.f</li>
    <li> I am a picky shopper when it comes to my hair.  I am also cost conscious when it comes to my hair and this is probably one of the more expensive products (considering the amount of hair product you actually get) I buy...but it is SO worth it.  I have botticelli curls and basically wash, mousse/gel and air dry.  I get to work and use this to \\&quot;de-crunch\\&quot; my hair and I love it.  Takes away the frizz, I can piece curls together, all with a natural hold.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;As for cost, like I said, it&#x27;s not the cheapest stuff out there, but you BARELY have to use any (in fact, if you use too much your hair gets a flat/oily look to it), so overall the value is actually pretty good.</li>
    <li> It is good when the hair is wet as it combs through nicely. BUT...it dried my hair out when it was dry and it did nothing for the frizzies as it describes it the commercials. I had to use a lot of it to clean my hair as it does not lather, so it can be very costly. I like other shampoos that you buy it the salon better.</li>
    <li> Love Wen and now love Amazon!!!  Had been ordering thru Wen but did not want to keep getting the shipment every 3 months so now I can get it when I need it thru Amazon...</li>
    <li> Once you use these products you will never use anything else. My hair was so frizzy and thin. LIFELESS. I bought these products for my sister and my daughter they are that good. Buy everything!!!!</li>
    <li> The best part about this stuff is the smell, I love it. I have 3B curly hair and don&#x27;t have luck with this stuff on my \\&quot;halo\\&quot; when I wear my hair down but love it for slicking back into a bun.</li>
    <li> That little piece of hair that you wish you could keep from falling in your eyes, is now out of your face. Does what you would hope it would do when you bought it.</li>
    <li> Favorite hair product! Would by from this seller again!</li>
    <li> This product is everything I know it to be. I have been using it for some time now. You are asking to many words.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite Wen product I&#x27;ve tried. LOVE their shampoos....but won&#x27;t be buying the texture balm again. Leaves the hair sticky looking and doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair body and shine...smells wonderful! ! I would definitely buy this product again!  Cranberry mint is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I believe the product must be old I use this product and it usually does not make my hair stiff and this product ad well as the other are not giving me what I usually get from. The Worn Products I can only summize that its old</li>
    <li> I use this on my temple and neck area hair when it is acting like brillo wire. You should know that it is a serious, heavy glue stick type of hair fixative; It does brush/comb out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Beware, this is a &amp;#34;trial size&amp;#34; which may not stand out to you, given the so called MSVP price quoted.  The normal size is 3 oz. this is .35!!  Very sneaky, buy from QVC.</li>
    <li> costly but worths every penny. when you apply it is not like gel, takes couple of days to learn. but a must now.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for every hair types. I just started using this but it is wonderful and hair looks wonderful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this provides that much texture, as the name suggests. For the price, it will work on days my hair doesn&#x27;t need to be &amp;#34;great&amp;#34;. I have a medium length pixi cut (a short style, but a little longer than most pixi&#x27;s) and I love Redken Wax Blast spray so I was hoping this would provide a similar texture but it has fallen short in my opinion. Mehhh...</li>
    <li> Feels great in my hair</li>
    <li> I guess maybe it is the climate I live in, but I dont realy understand the need for this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING if you want your curls to look good all day.</li>
    <li> Second time I have purchased this.  Use all the time.  Love it!  Have to use CPAP machine and believe it or not I use this on my face before I put the mask on.  Helps to keep my face from itching from the mask.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I need more of the product than what gets rubbed on the hans.  If I take a &amp;#34;slice&amp;#34;off or get a little more likeca small ball on rub it together on my palms I have enough to work in my hair.</li>
    <li> it does exactly what i wanted it to do...put style into my shoulder length hair w/o me having to use styling tools ... just apply before or after blow drying to various strands all over your head...leaves you with that &amp;#34;messy look&amp;#34; i love b/c i live at the beach and due to the heat, humidity, and wind, there is no use to perfectly style your hair anyway ... half way thru the day or upon going out for the evening all i have to do is bend over, rough up the roots with my fingertips, return to upright position and volia! ... a new freshened up &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Fast service at an excellent price! I look forward to doing business with this supplier in the future! I absolutely love this product...it&#x27;s prob my favorite of the WEN Product Line!!! It works miracles on my normally dry, curly, frizzy &amp; damaged hair!!! Love love love!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and have found this to be the best texturing balm out there.  Not to heavy &amp; good hold.</li>
    <li> The balm did not give me the results expected, nothing great about it. Just another balm at a high price.  I could have gotten the same results had I bought an ordinary balm at the super market.</li>
    <li> This was to thick for my hair. One night I was desperate with dry lips. Used this as a lip balm and it did wonderful. It also works well on hands. His products are all natural so it worked in a different way for me. Just love his stuff!!</li>
    <li> I use it once my hair is freshly wash and dry, and it moisturize my edges and my fly away, their nothing bad I can say about this product it do what it suppose to due.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this? Yes I would</li>
    <li> i have short hair, usually use rough paste by redken. this seems more like a pomade than texturizing. left my hair looking greasy</li>
    <li> Reasonable price new product,not disappoint .</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product made my hair feel very sticky and dirty. It felt like someone stuck a lollypop in my hair after use. I tried it on my hair wet and dry, and the results felt the same.</li>
    <li> All I can say is this product stinks, and I bought other wen products and they do not work. I was very disappointed in this product. It makes your hair feel sticky and oily. Not worth the price, it isn&#x27;t worth more than one dollar.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations (shipper was no problem). But the stuff itself is... ummm... disappointing. Very heavy and waxy and I followed the directions. (This is the wife posting via this account). Not worth sending back due to its initial low cost. I will try once more with it, and repost if I realize that I did do something wrong... Cheers.</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair. I want to keep my bangs straightened. Any hint of humidity makes my bangs flip up and I look like I have wings on the side of my head! So I got a good deal on the Wen Balm and gave it a try. It works the best of all the many, many, products I have tried. I just put it on the very end of my clean bangs, then straighten with my Ion straightener. They stay straight and &amp;#34;wing-free&amp;#34; for days! I will definitly buy again.</li>
    <li> love this Wen product/s.  been using for years!</li>
    <li> It is too heavy.  Flatened my hair right out.  The other WEN products I have used are great.  I have fine hair and the shampoo/conditioner work well for it.  My hair is healthier than it was 3 months ago.</li>
    <li> For the hair - use sooo little rubbed between palms and fingertips on wet hair.  Nice.  It&#x27;s also good for skin &amp; lips.</li>
    <li> Just started using Wen products and this stuff is amazing for taming those little annoying fly away hairs that always want to stick straight up off the top of your head. I won&#x27;t leave the house without applying this stuff, and the application is super easy. Honestly, best product I&#x27;ve ever used for fly away hair, and it actually works! Thank you, Wen!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Wen Cleansing Conditioner since it was first introduced a few years ago, and I really like it for cleansing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use various other products when styling my hair to give it texture and separation (short hair).  That is what I thought this product would do -- it didn&#x27;t.  I tried it ONCE.  It was hard to use and greasy.  I ordered the 5 small applicator bottles and they are all going back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like putting lip balm on my hands to spread into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hate it, nor do I love it.  Doubtful I&#x27;ll be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I like to use this when my hair gets a little dry and frizzy on the ends.  I just put some on my finger tips and thumb and grab small sections of hair massaging it in.  No more frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of WEN products and love to use this after I style my hair.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected. Very disappointed. Bad investment.</li>
    <li> Works great and not to heavy....</li>
    <li> DID NOT REALIZE HOW SMALL BUT I LOVE WEN PRODUCTS AND WILL USE AS A TRAVEL SIZE AND KEEP IN MY PURSE</li>
    <li> This is a good product when used in conjunction with the cleansing conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great Wen texturizing balm.  Just use a small amount rubbed on hand, a few circles and then smooth on hair and rub on ends.  Works great and lasts a long time.  I have used this item several times and it works wonders on my hair.  It is great for your hair too!!</li>
    <li> Sweet Almond Mint Texturing Balm is the best balm I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and does not weigh my hair down or make it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I like the mint scent.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase again.  Makes my hair a little sticky.</li>
    <li> Very good product, but pricy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Wen products</li>
    <li> Great to tame the frizz when the weather is humid!</li>
    <li> I live by the beach &amp; this is the only product that tames my hair without weighing it down. And it looks really good!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really give this balm much thought when I received it from a friend as a gift along with some other WEN products.  Actually, I had never heard of WEN products (I know...how could I NOT have heard about them?).  But after trying them, I am a fan of all of the WEN products that I have tried.  This balm works perfectly in my VERY thin fine hair. It does not weigh it down at all.  I always spray my hair lightly with hair spray before curling it with a curling iron. After my curls cool, I wipe the texturizing balm a few times across my palm, rub my palms together and then scrunch it into my curls - mainly on the ends.  My curls are much more defined and stay in longer.  I only use it when I want a curlier looking hair style.  Not on my smooth sleek curl days. You do not need to use much of this product at each application so the tube lasts a long time.  And Amazon sells this at a terrific price!!</li>
    <li> This product keeps my hair from getting all static like and keeps the loose hairs from popping up. Just don&#x27;t go without washing your hair for more than 3 days or it will look a little matted.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have much of an opinion on this texture balm. I cut my hair shortly after buying this, from very long to 3-4inches. To get the texture I wanted it made my hair a little too greasy, but maybe I just needed a different product for my purpose. I did like the way it smelled.</li>
    <li> Improves my hair styling capabilities.</li>
    <li> Love Chaz Dean&#x27;s productos!</li>
    <li> Very good price for the real deal.  It works really well as long as you use it right.  If you don&#x27;t know how. Google Chaz Dean and how to use . Would recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> Non greasy. Anything Wen is awesome. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, gives plenty of shine and &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; my hair to look it&#x27;s fullest.  It is also the best product I&#x27;ve found to protect my short colored hair from flat iron damage.  The best out there.</li>
    <li> I cannot wear hair spray or anything other stuff to keep my loose ends down. But now I have this. It was so great to have all my ends down and not blowing all around. It is a little sticky to touch. And the next day, if you do not wash your hair, you can get some hairs sticking up in the wrong direction (from sleeping funny). But just use some more to get it down. I actually roll the tube LIGHTLY over my hair.</li>
    <li> I was excited to have try this out and was glad I did not have to pay full price for a full size. As much as I thought it tamed my frizzies out I was a bit disappointed that it made my hair look greasy and after I washed it out my hair was a bit on the dry side. Maybe its just my hair but a small drop of vitamin e oil will do the same results and wont dry out the hair for less price. Glad I did not spend a lot on the full size. Trial was ok.  I suggest trying out with a trial size because if it does not agree with you , then you din not lose much</li>
    <li> The effect...not sure what the benefit is to use this. If I use too much it looks terrible...but when I use it right ..it does nothing for me . Wont buy again.HOWEVER LOVE WEN !!! Especially Pumpkin ! OMG I have new hair !!!</li>
    <li> Product came promptly, brand new as advertised and I even received a free sample of leave in conditioner. Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product that works well and smells lovely. The price was right and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> If you have trouble with flyaways or split-ends, this is a helpful product, especially when blow drying or using a flat-iron.  But be careful...a little goes a long way. Just a dab on your finger tips is all you need.  And the smell is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I tend to have oily hair, so  I can only use a very small amount to tame a few frizzy spots, but it works wells and does produce shine.  The one thing I have learned is I used this moreso as a night time leave-in moisturizer.  When I know I am going to wash my hair the next morning, I put a lot in hair til I have that slightly greasy look, comb it thru &amp; go to bed.  The next day after I wash, my hair looks amazing.  Just my weird discovery.</li>
    <li> I HAVE THIN HAIR AND WEN TEXTURE BALM ADDS SO MUCH THICKNESS.  MY HAIR IS EASIER TO MANAGE AND LOOKS GREAT.  I ALWAYS USED HAIR GEL, SPRAYS, &amp; ETC.  NOW I ONLY NEED WEN BALM.  SAVES ON MONEY, TIME AND SPACE.  I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I use it every day.  Hair is softer and smoother.  Will continue to purchase this product and other&lt;br /&gt;Wen products</li>
    <li> But it is great on dry feet. I would not buy again for my hair but I would but again as a foot cream.</li>
    <li> great products from Wen by Chaz Dean.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with Sweet Almond Mint.  I find the texture balm is the perfect solution to slightly dry ends.</li>
    <li> This product works great for my dad who has thick hair, but I have fine hair and it tends to weigh my hair down. It looks more oily than with other products for me. But as I said, if you have thick hair it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping your hair slick all around the front.</li>
    <li> This texturizing balm actually does for me what the WEN anti-frizz styling creme failed to do. It does feel pretty greasy on the fingers but dispersed throughout the ends and front sides of my hair, it is wonderful, leaving my hair soft, shiny and manageable. My hair is really dry in the front sides from excessive curling iron use and I my hairdresser told me to stop using the thing, which I did. Until I can get all the damage cut out with recurring trips to the salon, some of WEN&#x27;s products have been helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing for me is to take the smallest amount I think I will need of this and add more as needed. It really does keep frizz in check especially on high-humidity days and gives a nice shine. It smells great but not at all like the almond mint cleansing conditioner, and I can apply more between washes (I wash every other day) to pep up my style. Even when I&#x27;ve used too much, it still doesn&#x27;t have an adverse effect other than making my hair feel a little gummy but I can remedy that by combing through several times and setting with hairspray (I like John Frieda anti-humidity spray - it&#x27;s cheap and it works). I tried the styling creme by WEN and it was just awful for my fine hair. This texturizing balm is much better for my needs and I just love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a lifesaver! I have dry frizzy hair and I work at 5am every morning so I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on my hair. I add this texture balm once my hair is dry and it makes it totally manageable and shiny! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love wen and this is just another wonderful hair care product from Chaz Dean. I  will buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Very small size. Not crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> I have cury/dry/frizzy hair. I bought this thinking it would tame it down a little but thing is like putting wax in your hair. So greasy and clumps my hair together and you can&#x27;t separate it. Just made it awful. Nothing like shown on TV. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different texture balms and Chaz Dean&#x27;s is by far my favorite.  Does not leave a build up on your hair and love the almond mint fragrance!</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t strong enough to deal with my curly and frizzy hair...I had to use my old products.  Also it&#x27;s weird to get out...it&#x27;s like a Chapstick....</li>
    <li> It was suppose to be new, but the plastic wrapping on outside of tube was missing, so it had been opened!</li>
    <li> This balm adds some texture to the hair with out being greasy.  Really does help to mold the style in place.  The sweet almond mint fragrance is very light and not over powering.</li>
    <li> What a disappointment.  This is like the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; we used in the 80s, only in a stick.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I use WEN&#x27;s cleansing conditioner - I was surprised that this did not work very well. I thought it would be a stronger paste - it seems more for texturing and not really styling.</li>
    <li> Helps a bit with frizzed out hair ends. But it is not the miracle that is promised.  Good lip balm though.</li>
    <li> Thank you for allowing me to purchase such a great product at a low price. It has not disappoint. I am looking forward to getting the entire kit in Fig once the price goes down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and not through this site but when I finally order it. Not only was it not sent I had to call consistently to see where it was.  Next thing I know I have a refund.  Will NOT  be ordering from them again!</li>
    <li> My 16 year old son absolutely loves this product for his hair! His hair stays put  but is also soft to touch and the balm isn&#x27;t sticky or runny.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and use this balm every day to give me texture and volume! I love it!</li>
    <li> Works great, and I have fine hair.</li>
    <li> directions on package way to small cant read with a magnifying glass  blah blah blah yack yack yack asked too much</li>
    <li> This product, like most of the WEN products is great.&lt;br /&gt;This balm in particular has terrific hold, but is light and does not weigh your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it in two ways, one way is simply rubbing the stick in my hand then applying to hair.&lt;br /&gt;The other way is to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; with the stick.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I can&#x27;t understand is why WEN only offers this product in such a small application stick.&lt;br /&gt;Great product though</li>
    <li> I use the wen products this one is usually 18.00 it was great to fine it on sale it makes you hair shiny and soft</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Wen products and I do really liek this balm.  If you use only a slight amount it will lift and calm down any fly away hairs.  I have very thin hair, so this works great.  If I use too much though, it will weigh my hair down so use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with the wen products...this is great after you fix your hair it gets all the fizzies out of you hair and helps keep your hair looking great all day!</li>
    <li> It has made my hair feel greasy, and I actually thought that it would make my hair soft and unruly without being greasy.  Maybe I applied too much...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even used this product yet.  I think maybe I ordered the wrong thing, since I probably should have wavy or curly hair to get the best use out of this product.  My hair is perfectly straight.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for it at some point.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter loves it can&#x27;t wait to get the rest of the product</li>
    <li> love love love this texturizing balm! this is the 2nd one ive bought now and its not disappointe.</li>
    <li> I love this. I have never used this type of product before. When I saw it was made by Wen I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. I really like it. It&#x27;s great for stray hairs and any frizz that might pop up. It also gives the hair definition which I like. I would buy it again. I got it at a great price too...just waiting to see that same price again.</li>
    <li> i like the hold that it has onmy hair.... cheaper then what it is from the wen companycame quicker then waiting for the packet</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> Horrible!  What&#x27;s the purpose of this?  Should be used as a lip balm. What&#x27;s the purpose of this again? A waste of money</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and wavy with no direction. Product didn&#x27;t help my wayward direction but did minimize any frizzies</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s something new I thought i would try because I use a flat iron which is so much hotter than a regular curling iron.  But it is so sticky and a mess to apply to dry hair.  I am not seeing any difference when I use it.  But I think the Wen products are good products; this one just isn&#x27;t; working for me</li>
    <li> This is great to smooth your ends after drying your hair. Looks more polished. I love all Wen products and have used for years.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the products, and the delivery time of the product was fast. Thank you for the excellent service and product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this! I keep it in my purse to help control the few strands of hair that stick up on the crown of my head.  Its not sticky or greasy and it has the sweet almont scent without the mint.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length naturally curly hair. This product was very drying! It ruined my hair for the day, don&#x27;t recommend&lt;br /&gt;it!</li>
    <li> I used this product the very next day it came in and I didn&#x27;t like how it made my hair sticky.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo or as they call it cleansing conditioner.  Did not like this product but then I have baby fine hair, would probably work good on someone with alot of hair or long hair.  Smell is great!</li>
    <li> Nice product and find it great for taming the fly aways around my face.</li>
    <li> My hair is straight and fine.  It seems a little heavy for my hair type, but I need to keep trying.  I may have used too much product so I am going to use less the next time.</li>
    <li> I have used the product in the past and liked it.  was amazed how promptly delivered.</li>
    <li> I like product because my hair needs moisture but not enough for my needs,small bottle not large enough for my needs.would like to find a larger bottle</li>
    <li> I love this product! It gives my hair that piecy look I love and doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy or weigh it down.</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> My boys use this to do their hair, works good.</li>
    <li> I love Wen! This stuff does wonders</li>
    <li> Good product helps to define when you style your hair dont like the smell much after a couple of hours</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product ever. My son uses half as much of this as his normal pomade &amp; loves the way his hair looks &amp; feels.  He uses only Wen now.</li>
    <li> i have baby fine blonde hair (not cornsilk) and this provides just enough texture at the ends to give it a more healthy look.</li>
