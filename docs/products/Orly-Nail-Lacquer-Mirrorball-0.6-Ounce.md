      <li>but that isn&#x27;t a huge thing :p</li>
      <li>but IT COMES OFF VERY EASILY WITH ACETONE REMOVER.</li>
      <li>Love love love!</li>
      <li>Great Service and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Amazing color, smooth application, good coverage, I used 3 coats for full coverage but could&#x27;ve used 2.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I love it 😀😍</li>
      <li>My favorite nail polish.</li>
      <li>but it is sparkly and lovely.</li>
      <li>great product, fast shipping</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this.</li>
      <li>It took about two coats and a top coat</li>
      <li>I have received so many compliments on the mirrorball color.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS POLISH.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s in my collection.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a Sinful Colors Nail Polish user originally, but this ORLY nail polish has got me feeling some type of way!</li>
      <li>This is becoming a habit with the products I purchase for her.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily....</li>
      <li>I honestly just bought this polish just to have it, I don&#x27;t ever plan on using it because it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
      <li>and I have a mild hoarding obsession with polish!</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>It has a great consistency and only needs 2 coats.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s wearing pretty good, too with a top coat.</li>
      <li>in the beautiful array of rainbow colors that I was seeking, but not &amp;#34;THE ONE.&amp;#34; I almost walked out of the store, head hung, and empty handed.</li>
      <li>but I would recommend a high gloss top coat for a smooth shiny finish.  </li>
      <li>I love it so much.  </li>
      <li>Dries pretty quickly and the formula is easy to work with, too.</li>
      <li>super</li>
      <li>This is exactly everything I&#x27;ve been looking for in a holographic polish ever since it was so readily available in my childhood</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price of the purchase.</li>
      <li>One of those polishes that makes you stare at your hands while you&#x27;re wearing it because it is mesmerizing.</li>
      <li>So fun.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing this polish again for my own personal use, and to give as gifts to family and friends.</li>
      <li>The color is fantastic, very unique, I only wish it lasted longer.</li>
      <li>Orly polishes start chipping right away.</li>
      <li>Goes on your nails smooth and dries pretty fast.</li>
      <li>So pretty and mesmerizing</li>
      <li>Also super fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I have had it on for about a week now and have bathed and showered several times a day, and no chipping whatsoever A good coat of clear polish makes it look</li>
      <li>So glad for a commercial holo that looks like this!</li>
      <li>This is my first time using an ORLY nail polish</li>
      <li>Even without the top coat, it dried very quickly.</li>
      <li>One coat made my eyes well up with salty bodily fluids from my strong emotions.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Outside its okay, there is still a very grey color to it and inside well unless you&#x27;re directly under light</li>
      <li>I wish there was a little more linear holo in the background</li>
      <li>I just wish the holographic effect would be as strong as some of my other ones.</li>
      <li>As far as the polish it was packaged with care.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; enough that two coats completely covers your nail in sparkles</li>
      <li>It requires quite a few coats and a clear coat to make it really shiny.</li>

<li> Three coats (with clear protective base coat) works adequately.  </li>
<li> I have other glitters</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve gotten is 2-3 days without chips, using both a base coat and top coat, and 2 coats of color.</li>
<li> Silver-grey, with a slight linear holo, and sprinkled with holo micro-glitter.</li>
<li> I like the color for every day use, it is very pale on your nail, so it is not for some events, unless you do not want people stair at your nails.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried it with various base coat/top coat combinations, as well as on</li>
<li> Frustrating.</li>
<li> I am not happy.</li>
<li> The colors shimmer like crazy in the sun.</li>

    <li> Pro: beautiful, applies nicely, I like the rubber handle :)  Con: didn&#x27;t like that it came in a larger box that necessary but that isn&#x27;t a huge thing :p</li>
    <li> You need this color! A MUST have for every polish collection!</li>
    <li> Ah-freakin-mazing polish.  This polish is a baby unicorn&#x27;s giggles.  I love it so much.  So glad for a commercial holo that looks like this!</li>
    <li> This is the best nail polish I&#x27;ve ever bought. Goes on easily.... super sparkly Holo with teeny tiny glitter. So far it&#x27;s wearing pretty good, too with a top coat. Love it. UPDATE: I took this off today to put on nail envy and you&#x27;re not going to believe this but IT COMES OFF VERY EASILY WITH ACETONE REMOVER. I have other glitters I dread taking off and this was just like regular polish. Wish I could add another star!</li>
    <li> Being a nail polish addict I always look for the best holographic polishes. This one is so beautiful and the application is absolutely wonderful. Not only is the holo linear there are tiny bits of holo glitter so you have the sparkle as well. Just absolutely gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Polish, received quickly, excellent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got this and I love it 😀😍</li>
    <li> Lovely color!  Make sure you use a  top coat yo get great shine.</li>
    <li> Excellent opaque holo &amp;#34;non-gel&amp;#34; polish with excellent texture and coverage.  The product dries well but I would recommend a high gloss top coat for a smooth shiny finish.  Three coats (with clear protective base coat) works adequately.  Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Orly Mirrorball polish for my daughter and ended up wearing it myself. This is becoming a habit with the products I purchase for her. I just can&#x27;t keep my hands off her stuff. This nail polish is out of this world, holographic, and trippy! I love it! I wore it on my toes over a coat of silver polish and got so many compliments! This polish looks so beautiful in the sun when you get the full array of the beautiful holographic colors. It is long lasting as well. I have had it on for about a week now and have bathed and showered several times a day, and no chipping whatsoever A good coat of clear polish makes it look oh so great. Did I mention my daughter loves the polish as well? Definitely worth the price of the purchase. I will be purchasing this polish again for my own personal use, and to give as gifts to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I honestly just bought this polish just to have it, I don&#x27;t ever plan on using it because it&#x27;s so pretty. There&#x27;s so many ladies that always talk about how gorgeous it is and I have a mild hoarding obsession with polish! I definitely love this polish!</li>
    <li> Love love love! Mirror ball with OPI cajun shrimp</li>
    <li> Beautiful polish. I wish there was a little more linear holo in the background but it is sparkly and lovely.</li>
    <li> My favorite nail polish. It goes on smooth and has great coverage. The colors shimmer like crazy in the sun. It is definitely holographic! I am so glad I found this.</li>
    <li> Grateful polish love it!</li>
    <li> So pretty and mesmerizing</li>
    <li> It came out prettier than I imagined. I&#x27;m a Sinful Colors Nail Polish user originally, but this ORLY nail polish has got me feeling some type of way! This is my first time using an ORLY nail polish and I&#x27;ve found that I adore this polish itself, color and how it glitters in the sunlight! It took about two coats and a top coat (Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insti-Dry). Even without the top coat, it dried very quickly. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I went on a hunt for the perfect Unicorn-skin-holographic nail polish today. I desperately scanned every type of polish at the beauty supply store in search of this rare gem. I found endless amounts of glitter polishes (such a pain to remove!) in the beautiful array of rainbow colors that I was seeking, but not &amp;#34;THE ONE.&amp;#34; I almost walked out of the store, head hung, and empty handed. Suddenly it caught my eye... Orly Mirrorball. Could it be?! The store associate attempted to help me find the perfect shade - she knew what I was asking for, but didn&#x27;t think they carried it - but I knew I was close with this one. It didn&#x27;t seem right when I painted it over my perfect nude shade on my nails, but something told me to buy it anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong in my doubts about this being the shade I was looking for. This WAS the holographic I was looking for! One coat made my eyes well up with salty bodily fluids from my strong emotions. A second coat left my mascara and eyeliner running down my cheeks. This is exactly everything I&#x27;ve been looking for in a holographic polish ever since it was so readily available in my childhood 90&#x27;s days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect shade to match the top I made out of Unicorn skin fabric. Holographic for life!!</li>
    <li> I have received so many compliments on the mirrorball color. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; enough that two coats completely covers your nail in sparkles so you don&#x27;t have to worry about an undercoat/color.</li>
    <li> The color is fantastic, very unique, I only wish it lasted longer. Max wear I&#x27;ve gotten is 2-3 days without chips, using both a base coat and top coat, and 2 coats of color. On my nails, it tends to peel off rather than chipping. I&#x27;ve tried it with various base coat/top coat combinations, as well as on it&#x27;s own, and nothing has extended the wear. The gold color from this collection does the same thing, although my other Orly polishes don&#x27;t, so it must be something about this formulation.</li>
    <li> Thought it was going to be holographic but it isn&#x27;t. Orly polishes start chipping right away. Frustrating.</li>
    <li> Breath taking polish which every polish enthusiast should have in their collection.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS POLISH. Don&#x27;t wear it on a cloudy or rainy week, because you want to see how this sparkles in the sun. It is GORGEOUS. So, so sparkly. One of those polishes that makes you stare at your hands while you&#x27;re wearing it because it is mesmerizing. Dries pretty quickly and the formula is easy to work with, too.</li>
    <li> This polish is AMAZING!!! I don&#x27;t own anything quite like it! I have used it twice already. I love that it is thin enough to put over other polishes to make them holographic! So fun.</li>
    <li> How can this be called mirrorball and be matte??  I am not happy.</li>
    <li> Orly has an amazing formula. Love the grip, no-slip cap, and this color is gorgeous.  Silver-grey, with a slight linear holo, and sprinkled with holo micro-glitter.</li>
    <li> Great Service and fast shipping! As far as the polish it was packaged with care. It&#x27;s a great holographic polish I just wish the holographic effect would be as strong as some of my other ones. Outside its okay, there is still a very grey color to it and inside well unless you&#x27;re directly under light it just looks grey with a touch of sparkle.</li>
    <li> This polish is so amazingly beautiful! It has a great consistency and only needs 2 coats. Also super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Holographic effect</li>
    <li> Goes on your nails smooth and dries pretty fast. I like the color for every day use, it is very pale on your nail, so it is not for some events, unless you do not want people stair at your nails.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not your standard holographic nail polish. It requires quite a few coats and a clear coat to make it really shiny. But I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s in my collection. Will be good for winter</li>
    <li> Amazing color, smooth application, good coverage, I used 3 coats for full coverage but could&#x27;ve used 2. Tons of compliments on this color.</li>
