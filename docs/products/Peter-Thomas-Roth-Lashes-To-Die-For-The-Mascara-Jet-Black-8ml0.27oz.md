      <li>Easy to apply no clumping.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, it stays on, it does not smudge or flake.  </li>
      <li>and then this mascara on top (I like the look of full lashes).  </li>
      <li>Even though I don&#x27;t think I get as much volume and length as those cheaper products what I do get looks so much better!</li>
      <li>I tried putting it on lightly, and it didn&#x27;t matter, it always ended up the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not waterproof, but it doesn&#x27;t smear easily either.ng for the right mascara that gives you the magazine-beautiful lashes without any discomfort then try this!  </li>
      <li>It allows for multiple coats for great looking, full lash eyes.  </li>

      <li>This mascara is well worth the purchase!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get great lashes with an everyday quick sweep, and phenomenal lashes with attention to detail.  </li>
      <li>If you are searching for the right mascara that gives you the magazine-beautiful lashes without any discomfort then try this!  </li>
      <li>my everything that is supposed to be in a bold mascara.</li>

      <li>Love it and highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The best mascara for my short, flat, lashes.</li>
      <li>wear contact lenses and my eyes must be on the sensitive side because I just cannot tolerate most mascaras.  </li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite Mascara.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I liked the way the mascara separated my eyelashes</li>
      <li>Its a buildable mascara, so you can go from light, easy going makeup to big and bold.</li>
      <li>This goes on easy, last all day, and removes easy.  </li>
      <li>I know, some of you are saying right now, &amp;</li>
      <li>Great mascara, but very messy.</li>
      <li>The price of this mascara is very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I tried it a couple years ago and it has never failed me.</li>
      <li>I apply a coat of volumizing mascara first (drugstore)</li>
      <li>When I first tried this product, I sprayed my face with a finishing spray.</li>
      <li>First of all I don&#x27;t ever write rave reviews on things</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clump and makes me look like I have more lashes than I actually</li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied!</li>
      <li>This works well and does not run on hot sticky days.</li>
      <li>It dries fast, so you can actually apply more than one coat.  </li>
      <li>My eyelashes look longer and fuller and the color is a beautiful deep black.  </li>
      <li>I have been pretty picky about my mascara ever since I got tired of Maybelline Great Lash.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes seemed shorter than before and stick straight.  </li>
      <li>So, it doesn&#x27;t take as much mascara to show up on my lashes.</li>
      <li>So I was very optimistic about this mascara.</li>
      <li>Really like it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I first put it on my lashes looked good. Half way into the day it started to come off. I kept having to wipe dried up mascara off my face the rest of the day. By the time I got home from work looked like I didn&#x27;t even have on mascara!! Very dissatisfied!</li>
    <li> If you want lashes to die for, here is the product. A good value compared to better brands. I have never used such a wonderful mascara that lives up to its name.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara. Tried many. This works well and does not run on hot sticky days.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear contact lenses and my eyes must be on the sensitive side because I just cannot tolerate most mascaras.  The problem has always been the same - globby mascara that makes my lashes clump together and when they dry my lashes try to stick together when I blink.  I know, some of you are saying right now, &amp;#34;well don&#x27;t put on so much!&amp;#34;  That wasn&#x27;t it.  I tried putting it on lightly, and it didn&#x27;t matter, it always ended up the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I decided to try a new mascara it was due to claims that their brushes were designed such that mascara went on smoothly and clumpy spider eyes would be a thing of the past.  Some of my experiments got close, but the stick-together-lashes issue never got resolved. This went on for so long that  I had given up and resigned myself to the fact that I was just going to have to embrace the lash-less look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My assistant has beautiful eyes with perfectly glossed and separated lashes and one day I just had to ask her what her secret was.  She reached into her purse and pulled out a tube of this mascara. She told me that it never clumps and you can layer applications of it to build lashes to be as thick as you want all the while never clumping or sticking together.  I was a little skeptical but thought I&#x27;d try one last time.  When my mascara arrived, I anxiously opened it up and saw immediately that the brush was much different than others I had tried.  It didn&#x27;t have all the bristles that you usually see and that harbor thick clumps of goo.  Another difference was the consistency of the mascara itself. It&#x27;s thick, but not too thick. It&#x27;s not tarry and greasy like others. It glides on so nice and smooth. The consistency is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I now use this every day and I don&#x27;t even know its there except when I look in the mirror and see my luscious well-glossed and separated lashes.  The price of this mascara is very reasonable.  I am now a fan for life!  If you are searching for the right mascara that gives you the magazine-beautiful lashes without any discomfort then try this!  It&#x27;s not waterproof, but it doesn&#x27;t smear easily either.ng for the right mascara that gives you the magazine-beautiful lashes without any discomfort then try this!  It&#x27;s not waterproof, but it doesn&#x27;t smear easily either.</li>
    <li> Yet another high priced, highly rated mascara that disappoints.  This mascara does nothing for my eyelashes - I apply it and it seems like it actually makes my eyelashes disappear instead of volumizing them!  Cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> I am always experimenting with makeup, trying something different or new. I came across this mascara, read some of the reviews and decided to give it a try. This mascara did very little for my lashes and it made my eyes itch after a few hours of wear.  I&#x27;ve gotten much better results with Maybelline mascara and had no irritation - guess I will stick with that.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I would not buy again.  I found that Grande Lash is much better</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking that it was waterproof. It says so on the label box. When I first tried this product, I sprayed my face with a finishing spray. Soon after, my mascara started to run and with it being jet black, my makeup was essentially ruined. Overall, I liked the way the mascara separated my eyelashes and it gave them nice volume and fullness. Its a buildable mascara, so you can go from light, easy going makeup to big and bold. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again due to the fact that its not waterproof.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump or flake, or smear which are my three biggest issues. Really like it. Would buy it again and probably will buy it again</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail mascara.  I love mascara and wear it everyday, even if I do not wear any other makeup.  I apply a coat of volumizing mascara first (drugstore) and then this mascara on top (I like the look of full lashes).  It is amazing!  It never looks clumpy, lengthens and separates my lashes well.  People ask if I have lash extensions regularly.  Cannot say it enough, it is so good!</li>
    <li> I had been buying very expensive mascara from the cosmetic department.  On a whim, I decided to try the Lashes to Die For, and will never go to the cosmetic counter again.  Love it and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This mascara is wonderful. It allows for multiple coats for great looking, full lash eyes.  This mascara is well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara</li>
    <li> I love this mascera. It is perfect for sensitive eyes and lasts all day without smearing or flaking. I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I love Peter Thomas Roth products and this lives up to everything I thought it would be.  I only wear water proof/water resistant Mascara and was a little concerned reading reviews that said it did not stay on all day, but that is not true at all.  This goes on easy, last all day, and removes easy.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with flaking either.  My eyelashes look longer and fuller and the color is a beautiful deep black.  Will definitely purchase again!!</li>
    <li> I keep buying this one because I love it.  Tried others but they do not hold up as well as this one does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras that I&#x27;ve lost track. My main issues were flaking, bleeding color, smudging (big problem under the eyes), and wearing off throughout the day. Eventually, someone recommended PTR mascara (this product). I tried it a couple years ago and it has never failed me. I strayed a couple times during the last couple years and was always disappointed and immediately returned to PTR.</li>
    <li> Does not melt during the day even on lower lashes.  Easy to apply no clumping. Good everyday natural looking.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I will ever use.  It makes my eyes look so good!!!  They are thicker and longer.</li>
    <li> I have been pretty picky about my mascara ever since I got tired of Maybelline Great Lash. I have been buying and using Bourguese mascara but have found it hard to find these days. So I went on Amazon and looked thru and read many reviews and came across this mascara. It is really great stuff! First of all it is black~and I mean black. It doesn&#x27;t look lighter when I put it on as many others look dark brown. So, it doesn&#x27;t take as much mascara to show up on my lashes. And the brush is awesome! One side is shorter, one side is longer and that makes the mascara much easier to apply. I use the short side to get the color on my lashes and then the long side to comb them out. I see that they look longer without the clumps. This mascara adds volume and length without clumpy messes. It does not make my eyelashes look fake, and does not add volume and length like the cheaper mascaras that do make clumps and bumps. Even though I don&#x27;t think I get as much volume and length as those cheaper products what I do get looks so much better! My friend tells me I don&#x27;t have that spidery look anymore! I might be able to make longer lashes with repeated applications but haven&#x27;t tried that yet. Really love this stuff because it works so well, looks good, wears all day and doesn&#x27;t flake off and yet comes off easily with soap and water. I will definitely be buying this mascara again.</li>
    <li> I am bias when it comes to Peter Thomas Roth. I buy a lot of his products. So I was very optimistic about this mascara. It goes on very creamy, and soft. It does not clump up the way most mascara does. But as for as if being &amp;#34;to die for&amp;#34;, I cannot say it is.  It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly, so you must be careful not to get it on your face, or brow. It does wipe off, unlike most mascaras. Which means you don&#x27;t have to redo your entire eye, because you got a smudge of mascara in the wrong place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I would buy it again, but I do have another favorite, (Givenchy)</li>
    <li> This is awesome mascara.  It goes on with no cumps.  Would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I love this macsera, it doesn&#x27;t clump and glides on smoothly</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many mascaras and the reviews for this were outstanding.  I did not feel that way.  It does separate the lashes but that is about it.  If you are looking for volume or even length this is not for you.  I am disappointed, once again.  The best I have found for volume is Tarte Amazonian Clay mascara.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything special that a store bought brand...not any longer eyelashes:(</li>
    <li> The mascara is okay.  It flakes.  That&#x27;s all I can say.  I judge all mascaras on whether or not they flake at the end of the day after you&#x27;ve worn it for 7 hours or so at work.  For me that&#x27;s the judge of a good mascara or not.  I do not have super long lashes and this did okay, it just didn&#x27;t make them look much longer!  ha.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I have been using mascara for years and have always been trying to find the perfect serum and finally I have found it! This is my go-to...my beloved....my everything that is supposed to be in a bold mascara. I don&#x27;t know why Sephora had this product in the back of the store and then eventually discontinued it but it deserves way more spotlight and credit than it gets. It is a bit pricey but it is worth it, one tube will last you months. I typically lather on layers to make my lashes thick but this product only needs a couple of layers and your done with NO clumps. I purchase this through Amazon and have not been dissapointed yet.... not sure what other department stores sell it but this product is perfect!</li>
    <li> Used to buy more expensive mascara until I found this on Amazon. Have ordered a few times and will keep coming back! No clumping and makes my short lashes look longer and fuller!</li>
    <li> It does tend to clump on me, also to slide down under my eyes some. Not my favorite, esp for the price.</li>
    <li> This mascara will give you lengthy lashes! It didn&#x27;t do much for the fullness of mine, but it certainly gave them a natural curl and wonderful length!</li>
    <li> The absolute best! No clumps!</li>
    <li> Works to grow long lashes after a couple of months.  I use a lash conditioner along with it.  Great lashes!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now, no clumping.</li>
    <li> Very black mascara really accentuates the eyes</li>
    <li> Although I received the product very quickly, it was the worst mascara I ever purchased.  Usually this mascara is wonderful and goes on clump free, but this one was thick and clumpy and not at all what I expected from a Peter Thomas Roth product.  I think it was old and had outlived it&#x27;s shelf life.  Please check your products&#x27; lifespan!!</li>
    <li> First of all I don&#x27;t ever write rave reviews on things but I&#x27;d been looking for a good conditioning mascara after my eyelash extensions fell out.  My eyelashes seemed shorter than before and stick straight.  I was thinking of getting some fake eyelashes and applying them often when I came across this mascara.  Now did it suddenly make my eyelashes a half an inch longer, no but it made them look so much better and it was holding the curl way better as well. I&#x27;m not as embarrassed as I was with my awful lashes and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> After my disastrous attempt at [[ASIN:B001FYZTEW false eyelashes]], I was in desperate need of mascara.  I hadn&#x27;t bought it because I thought I&#x27;d be switching, but I didn&#x27;t, so I thought I&#x27;d give this mascara a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fantastic.  It is deeply pigmented black, with a rich, not runny or thick texture.  The brush is long and quite narrow.  There are two lengths of bristles.  One is the traditional length, the other quite short.  The longer bristles build length, and the short ones volume.  The short and long bristles are evenly dispersed.  This mascara is super-easy to apply.  The narrow brush allows reach to the outermost lashes, and you can coat those lashes without getting mascara on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara builds wonderfully without clumping or flaking.  It dries fast, so you can actually apply more than one coat.  You&#x27;ll get great lashes with an everyday quick sweep, and phenomenal lashes with attention to detail.  My mascara trick is coating those lashes on the outside corner of the eye.  Most wands don&#x27;t accommodate this well, but this one is aces.  And it stays in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says this is water-resistant, and one day my eyes just decided to start watering, but it didn&#x27;t run.  But it is not a water-proof mascara by any means.  Even two coats are easily removed with eye makeup remover, or a water-based cleanser such as Cerave for Normal to Oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an impressive mascara, upon which I bestow the rare HB Best Buy on Amazon stamp of approval.  I highly recommend it.  Two wings up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years.  Its staying power is solid, great water resistance, and it really allows my lashes to look their longest.  I wish they made it in brown, too, but I&#x27;ll take what I can get.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara but I would like it even better if it was waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;It does not smudge or cake and that is great, but unfortunately it does run if you get hot and sweat.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for the perfect mascara for years &amp; I am soooo happy that I found this one!! Great length, consistency &amp; the applicator wand is a perfect size for me. I have chronic dry eyes from Sjogrens &amp; this mascara doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.  It is so worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite Mascara.  It goes on easily, it stays on, it does not smudge or flake.  I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of mascaras over the years and this is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clump and makes me look like I have more lashes than I actually have.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it conditions your lashes. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Clumps not as expected.</li>
    <li> great mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very natural--great length without being fake looking</li>
    <li> This mascara rocks would be very hard to use anything else</li>
    <li> The brush separates lashes very well.</li>
    <li> Great mascara, but very messy. Runs easily - but it makes my lashes look amazing</li>
    <li> The best mascara for my short, flat, lashes. Just love it, it curly and lengthens.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s perfect and does the job well.</li>
    <li> Does all that it claims.  Fabulous results!.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other mascara&#x27;s, and always revert back to Peter Thomas Roth...great quality product!</li>
