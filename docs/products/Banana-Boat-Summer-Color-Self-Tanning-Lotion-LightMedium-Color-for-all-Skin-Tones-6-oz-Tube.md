      <li>Best drugstore tanner I&#x27;ve tried</li>

      <li>One of my favorite self-tanning lotions!!!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for fair skin!</li>
      <li>The tanning part (I&#x27;m very fair skinned)&lt;br /&gt;is</li>

      <li>I am very fair</li>
      <li>Great product works perfect!</li>
      <li>After reading great reviews I tried this product.</li>
      <li>With some lotions this may have caused streaking, but with this lotion there was no issue, just great color.</li>
      <li>luck and happy save self tanning, whatever product you choose</li>
      <li>but I was still happy with the product.</li>
      <li>then you would use it like 2xs a week to maintain it,another great product im happy with</li>
      <li>Great product for the price</li>
      <li>I have used many self tanning products and this is the best!!!</li>
      <li>and I also have a fair amount of freckles.</li>
      <li>I was very happy with the ease of application and streak free tan.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;&#x27;m fair skinned, but ruddy</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not so good for the legs, however.</li>
      <li>Easy to use - no &#x27;orange&#x27; tinge - makes me feel good looking tanned without the sun rays!</li>
      <li>for anyone wanting this kind of self developing gradual tan, I recommend Banana Boat alone for the pleasant smell compared to L;oreal (love loreal products) the tanning lotions (stating they have a pleasant citrus smell) are not for everyone.</li>
      <li>Love this lotion!</li>
      <li>I love the end result!</li>
      <li>So happy with this product and would strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have very light skin applied after a good shower where i shaved and exfoliated my skin before application.</li>
      <li>and it really works.very very excellent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice gradual tan and lasts for days.</li>
      <li>it does go on very easily.</li>
      <li>This came promptly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The cream goes on smoothly with no</li>
      <li>I have tried many bronzers and this onw is the best I have ever used no streaking orange color very natural</li>
      <li>at first its great smelling.</li>
      <li>by the odor and the very light tan it gave me</li>
      <li>and has a nice texture, easy to rub in, just not for me, as I do not want to re apply until I achieved the desired level of tan</li>
      <li>It gives me a very good natural looking skin color without staining my clothes.</li>
      <li>more than Jergen&#x27;s  tanning product had made me.</li>
      <li>OK.</li>
      <li>Daughter and I discovered this product over a year ago and just love it.</li>
      <li>I have used it many times</li>
      <li>This was okay.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you rub the lotion around evenly</li>
      <li>used better-</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>it is okay</li>
      <li>I premix the lotion with my body lotion, which I use 2/3rds more of.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I use this lotion - nice scent, good color, even coverage and reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I bought this cause the reviews were really good, and they were right on.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t show orange on my skin tone (and I am pretty fair skinned).</li>
      <li>Good product, but smells funny.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
      <li>Smell is fine at application and gets that tanner smell as the day goes one</li>
      <li>If you are very fair it might show up a little better than on someone with darker skin.</li>
      <li>I have tried quite a few tanning lotions, and this is the best yet!  </li>
      <li>But I do apply the self tanner quite lightly.</li>
      <li>I have very pale skin and the Light/Medium shade works best for me.</li>
      <li>good color, not yellow.  </li>
      <li>The color has good stay power and will last, but can be softened with exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>but overall is a good self tanner for the price.</li>
      <li>I mixed the lotion with my favorite moisturizer for application on my neck and arms to prevent too much color too fast, and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a quick process.</li>
      <li>This is a awesome product,I learned from my gf who uses it daily as her tan is beautiful,I use it and it does make you tan nicely,no orange look to it,you just have to put it on daily till you get the tan you want</li>
      <li>I put mine on after a shower and it does seems pleasant enough at first..</li>
      <li>and it looks fine, But be sure to wash fingernails, etc., as it DOES stain if you&#x27;&#x27;re not careful.</li>
      <li>a had a beautiful hint of color in my pale skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is actually pretty good, it&#x27;s tinted so you can see where you are applying it, the color lasts for several days, and it doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothing or bedsheets.</li>
      <li>This will prevent streaking and the tanner will go on very smoothly and naturally.</li>
      <li>very easy to apply, goes on smoothly, barely any smell...</li>
      <li>Within a few hours of applying, the color is noticeable and great looking.  </li>
      <li>In the sun, I tend to just freckle more and burn rather than come anywhere near what people might call a bronze color.</li>
      <li>look lol.make sure to wait until the tan is completely developed before applying additional costs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other tanning lotions that worked fairly well, but after some research, I found Banana Boat&#x27;s version this summer</li>
      <li>I am positive I will never bake in the sun again!</li>
      <li>and I think I will stick with the fake bake tanners , spray or lotion which if you use less of them, in just one application process give you a very nice flawless tan, yet you can apply more generously or re apply the next day</li>
      <li>This lotion gives an incredibly natural look, I&#x27;d even say better than a real tan.</li>
      <li>like literally no bad smell at all which pretty much sealed the deal for me.</li>
      <li>I have tried several self tanning lotions over the years but have very light complexion</li>
      <li>It really worked and did not turn me orange!  </li>
      <li>It has SLIGHTLY more of an orange tinge than I prefer but that&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
      <li>Therefore, tanning lotion seemed like a logical step for me.</li>
      <li>,again it was my first time.</li>
      <li>and I really like it!</li>
      <li>This goes on streak free, which stunned me as I&#x27;ve not yet had this experience with a drugstore self tanner (except old formula Sublime).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really aiming for a true tan,just some light color.  </li>
      <li>Is not dramatic in the tone.</li>
      <li>As with all sunless tanning you have to be careful around knees, ankles, elbows, but use your normal tricks and this will give you nice brownish hue.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to any one looking for a cheap way to tan since you can pick it up at your local wal-mart for under 8 bucks .</li>
      <li>so I could never find a lotion that resulted in a real looking skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I really loveeeeee this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this lotion.</li>
      <li>and it really does work.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
      <li>The color is incredibly real looking.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used this product long enough to comment. It has a very pleasant smell however, so, thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I am pretty careful putting it on and probably use it lighter than most would, so I am not saying it is impossible to get blotchy.  Is not dramatic in the tone.</li>
    <li> I bought this cause the reviews were really good, and they were right on. It adds just enough color with out streaking or any weird coloring. I use it once or twice a week on my legs since they don&#x27;t tan as well as the rest of my body. Very happy with it. I am blonde haired and blue eyed, so the light to medium is just enough color.</li>
    <li> Works alright. I didn&#x27;t see much of a change in my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, I&#x27;&#x27;l replace it again when gone. I&#x27;&#x27;m fair skinned, but ruddy and it looks fine, But be sure to wash fingernails, etc., as it DOES stain if you&#x27;&#x27;re not careful. Application is easier with a mitt.</li>
    <li> Best self tanning lotion for the price.  No shimmer, glitter or other nasty shiny stuff that screams &amp;#34;This tan isn&#x27;t real!&amp;#34; You can see it go on with a light color and the tan develops slowly throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super white and I looked a little orange but I was still happy with the product. I used a scrub before each use and that helped it last longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for years. I only use it on my face. It gives a light natural looking tan that lasts approximately two washes. I put it on after my moisturizer dries at night and then let it dry for about five minutes before going to bed. Do not apply thickly and make sure you rub it in well to make it even. I use a dry towel to blend the edges, creases, and eyebrows. Leaving it overnight gives it time to develop so you don&#x27;t get any uneven surprises during the day. The residue washes off in the morning with a wet washrag, preventing any uneven spots. I have very pale skin and the Light/Medium shade works best for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this lotion. I am fair skinned and I don&#x27;t tan easily. This lotion gives an incredibly natural look, I&#x27;d even say better than a real tan. So happy with this product and would strongly recommend it. I am positive I will never bake in the sun again!</li>
    <li> Me encanta Banana Boat Summer Colors Autobronceador Luz Loción para Medium - 6 fl oz, compre2 potes muy bueno 5 extrellas</li>
    <li> Like the color but you could totally tell its a self tanner!!</li>
    <li> If applied evenly and in a thin layer this product will not streak. Use it daily until the desired tanning affect has been obtained.</li>
    <li> Received this and have used it twice.  It really worked and did not turn me orange!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I looooove this!!! I have used many self tanning products and this is the best!!! No streaks i promise you!!!</li>
    <li> Lighter than I thought it would be but doesn&#x27;t streak goes on easy little to no smell blah blah blah</li>
    <li> The product works well. It did not leave an orange color. Some oxygenated water fell on me and I noticed it took the color off. So be careful around that stuff. TIP If you do not like the color I guess that will do the trick to take it off.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the ease of application and streak free tan.  My only problem is the discoloration of my bra straps.</li>
    <li> Good product, but smells funny. Try using it at night or way before you are gonna be around other people</li>
    <li> I used it once so far and it tiger striped my legs and arms. I &#x27;ll put it on with water next time I try it.  One review I read mentioned doing that.  I was quite disappointed.  And it got very dark....more than Jergen&#x27;s  tanning product had made me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve self tanned for years and years, I was self tanning before it came into fashion. One of my favorites used to be Loreal Sublime but when they upped and changed the formula and added glitter, I left it for  tanner pastures. I am so pale that I never tan naturally and I also have a fair amount of freckles. In the sun, I tend to just freckle more and burn rather than come anywhere near what people might call a bronze color. Self tanning is a boon to me. I can actually get a little color without sacrificing my skin in the process. I tried the darker formula of Summer Color but found it way too dark. I&#x27;m not really aiming for a true tan,just some light color.  This goes on streak free, which stunned me as I&#x27;ve not yet had this experience with a drugstore self tanner (except old formula Sublime). But I do apply the self tanner quite lightly. With this stuff, I apply about one and a half tablespoons of lotion to each leg. I premix the lotion with my body lotion, which I use 2/3rds more of. So for every dollop of self tanner, I mix w/2 to 3 dollops of lotion. This will prevent streaking and the tanner will go on very smoothly and naturally. Word of warning, you will be rubbing this in for a few minutes. This isn&#x27;t a quick process. I put about a half to half ratio of tanner to lotion on my arms. They should be darker naturally, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I always do the leg test in sunlight test after application (after it&#x27;s developed) and this one has passed every time. No tell tale streaks, no blotches on the ankles or knees. And it doesn&#x27;t look orange. I think I might prefer this one to the Clarins self tanner, that is my current fave.</li>
    <li> Great product works perfect! Great color will def buy again! No orange I am olive skinned and it worked great! Very natural looking</li>
    <li> Works very well.  My new self tanner for the summer months.</li>
    <li> As with all sunless tanning you have to be careful around knees, ankles, elbows, but use your normal tricks and this will give you nice brownish hue.  Doesn&#x27;t show orange on my skin tone (and I am pretty fair skinned). Smell is fine at application and gets that tanner smell as the day goes one (I find putting baby powder on helps).</li>
    <li> I liike this tanner...good color, not yellow.  Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Still gives a person that odor after a day of using it.. at first its great smelling. The tanning part (I&#x27;m very fair skinned)&lt;br /&gt;is OK. Not very much of a difference after a few days of use.  Kinda hoped it would be darker. There is no streaking&lt;br /&gt;and it does go on very easily. I put mine on after a shower and it does seems pleasant enough at first.. just turned off&lt;br /&gt;later by the odor and the very light tan it gave me</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the reviews.  I tried it and was very careful how I applied it.  I still got streaks from putting it on uneven in lots of  areas and you can definitely tell it&#x27;s fake tan, so I haven&#x27;t been wearing my shorts until it wears off.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Very natural color, not orange.</li>
    <li> Actually bought it for my Daughter. Took a long time to fully dry and was a bit streaky. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> After reading great reviews I tried this product. It stained my undergarments and did not give a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; look at all. It was recommended by Web MD so I had hoped it would work but did not.</li>
    <li> This is the only tanning lotion I use (mix with equal parts Loreal tan gel) it&#x27;s the perfect mixture - never ends up orange!</li>
    <li> I have very light skin applied after a good shower where i shaved and exfoliated my skin before application. I Applied very little due to the fact that this was my first time using a self tanner and was not looking forward to a orange look. To my surprise when i awoke the next morning a had a beautiful hint of color in my pale skin. I had no striking i did have a little patch under my wrist that was not colored but that was due to me not evenly spreading the tanner,again it was my first time. I would recommend this product to any one looking for a cheap way to tan since you can pick it up at your local wal-mart for under 8 bucks .</li>
    <li> Sorry- not for my skin. used better- this is one of the worst. It works for some since I purchased it on your reviews.</li>
    <li> I have tried many bronzers and this onw is the best I have ever used no streaking orange color very natural</li>
    <li> I really loveeeeee this product.I tried lastnight and it really works.very very excellent.</li>
    <li> I am an extremely light-skinned person and rarely lay out in the sun. Therefore, tanning lotion seemed like a logical step for me. I&#x27;ve tried other tanning lotions that worked fairly well, but after some research, I found Banana Boat&#x27;s version this summer and I really like it! Directly after application, there is no change in the color of my skin but then usually the next day, I can see a nice, healthy tan, especially the areas that are already a little bit tanner than the rest.  The only complaint that I have is the smell - it&#x27;s not a bad smell; it&#x27;s almost a gingerbread-like scent (to me at least), but the problem is that it doesn&#x27;t go away for a while and lingers on clothing. But it&#x27;s not worth taking off a star for because the lotion does its job well :)</li>
    <li> This product creates a natural tan appearance on my arms and face, if I&#x27;m careful to rub it in evenly.  It&#x27;s not so good for the legs, however.</li>
    <li> This came promptly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The cream goes on smoothly with no streaks.&lt;br /&gt;The tan lasts longer than other creams.</li>
    <li> Daughter and I discovered this product over a year ago and just love it. Easy to use - no &#x27;orange&#x27; tinge - makes me feel good looking tanned without the sun rays!</li>
    <li> I like this product but would not put any self-tanner on my face again. Everytime I do, it is obvious that I have done so. But the rest of my body looked sunkissed and it was just the sort of pick me up I needed for this long Chicago winter</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a skeptic with these sunless tanning lotions but I tried this one and it really does work.  Just make sure you rub the lotion around evenly and you&#x27;ll get a real looking tan.  WHEN I run out of this bottle, I&#x27;m definitely getting another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this sunless tanning lotion for years. I love it. It&#x27;s a nice gradual tan and lasts for days. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you like orange, then by all means buy it.  It&#x27;s streaky, and I hate it.</li>
    <li> it is okay but like all the others you either don&#x27;t wash your hands and your fingers turn orange or you wash you hands and everything but your hands are kinda tan.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite self-tanning lotions!!!</li>
    <li> This was okay. Smelled a little funny, applied a little blotchy but overall is a good self tanner for the price.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few tanning lotions, and this is the best yet!  The color is incredibly real looking.  Not orange in color at all.  And for someone with very pale skin, it means so much to find a product that works so well.  Within a few hours of applying, the color is noticeable and great looking.  I recommend applying to well moisturized skin, because it can pigment dry skin in a strange manner.  The color has good stay power and will last, but can be softened with exfoliation.  I mixed the lotion with my favorite moisturizer for application on my neck and arms to prevent too much color too fast, and it worked great.  With some lotions this may have caused streaking, but with this lotion there was no issue, just great color.</li>
    <li> I have tried several self tanning lotions over the years but have very light complexion so I could never find a lotion that resulted in a real looking skin tone.  I mix the lotion with some basic Vaseline skin lotion (about 50/50) an hour or so before I go to bed about 2-3 times a week.  It gives me a very good natural looking skin color without staining my clothes. I always wash my palms after application to prevent having a tell tale sign of using self tanning lotions and nobody has any idea I use it yet I have received compliments.</li>
    <li> I have used it many times and I don’t see any difference.  Nobody could tell I have even put it on.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!! I got it at target for about 7$ bc I had run out of my tomas tan perfect (which I&#x27;ve used for 15yrs) n I didn&#x27;t really have 16$ for a new bottle of it so I got this.to use in the mean time. I was VERY pleasantly surprised with the results. very easy to apply, goes on smoothly, barely any smell...like literally no bad smell at all which pretty much sealed the deal for me. very little staining/rub off on my sheets n clothes as well. Dries fast n doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky. I actually felt pretty moisturized. The only complaints I have n they aren&#x27;t even really complaintsis that there is not very much of a color guide. The lotion is not very dark, it does have a slight brownish color to it but once it went on I couldn&#x27;t really see where it was. If you are very fair it might show up a little better than on someone with darker skin. I am normally very fair but I had some &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tan left from the beds (i had got a gift cert) so it was really hard for me to see where the product was going n if I had blended it correctly. It has SLIGHTLY more of an orange tinge than I prefer but that&#x27;s just a personal preference. It&#x27;s in no way shape or form that nasty classic self tan orange, it looks pretty natural n after an additional application it goes away along with evening out any spots I.missed due to not having much of a color guide. I am very fair so I usually need 2 applications of a product to achieve my desired color anyways bc I like to be dark. This is a buildable tan. You can use 1 app for a Sun kissed look or 2-3 apps for a deeper &amp;#34;I live at the beach&amp;#34; look lol.make sure to wait until the tan is completely developed before applying additional costs. The bottle says 3hrs but I wait until it has developed n I have showered off the excess before reapplying.  I will absolutely purchase again. I am actually thinking of switching that&#x27;s how much I like it. Best drugstore tanner I&#x27;ve tried n I have literally tried almost all of them!!</li>
    <li> This is a awesome product,I learned from my gf who uses it daily as her tan is beautiful,I use it and it does make you tan nicely,no orange look to it,you just have to put it on daily till you get the tan you want then you would use it like 2xs a week to maintain it,another great product im happy with</li>
    <li> I could barely notice the difference after using it 3 times a week for a while. Maybe it is for the people with REALLY white skin or something.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use this lotion - nice scent, good color, even coverage and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless tanners... all of them either smelled bad, made me orange, streaked, or came off on my clothing. I haven&#x27;t had any of these problems with this tanner! My skin is very pale (with pink undertones, cosmetically speaking). I learned about this product via pinterest and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m never buying anything else! The smell is actually pretty good, it&#x27;s tinted so you can see where you are applying it, the color lasts for several days, and it doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothing or bedsheets. I did notice a little blotchiness as my skin grew if I skipped putting it on, but now that I apply regularly I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore. I apply it using gloves, and I also use Xen Tan, a blending balm that you can find on amazon (to make my tan even around my wrists, ankles, etc.).  I love the end result! I&#x27;m totally sold on this product, and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Love it just doesn&#x27;t last very long but is very easy to use and keeps your skin sofe at the same time</li>
    <li> Mix this with some regular lotion and it&#x27;s perfect for fair skin!</li>
    <li> and has a nice texture, easy to rub in, just not for me, as I do not want to re apply until I achieved the desired level of tan, I am really pale and I think I will stick with the fake bake tanners , spray or lotion which if you use less of them, in just one application process give you a very nice flawless tan, yet you can apply more generously or re apply the next day and you do not have to wait until you achieved the desired tan ,just to at that point exfoliate and start all over. Just not for me .&lt;br /&gt;But for anyone wanting this kind of self developing gradual tan, I recommend Banana Boat alone for the pleasant smell compared to L;oreal (love loreal products) the tanning lotions (stating they have a pleasant citrus smell) are not for everyone. Also Nivea has a strong smell and takes very long to develop .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and happy save self tanning, whatever product you choose</li>
