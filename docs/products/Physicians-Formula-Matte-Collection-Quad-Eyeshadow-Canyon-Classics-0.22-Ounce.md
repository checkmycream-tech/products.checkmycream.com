      <li>I love this product because it is truly a MATTE color.</li>

      <li>I love how the colour is matte.</li>
      <li>Were it reformulated to be better quality</li>
      <li>durability is just okay, too.  </li>

      <li>Glad I</li>
      <li>My favorite matte eyeshadow.  </li>
      <li>Love the color and texture of this eye shadow.</li>
      <li>The color in the lower right hand corner looks like a brown in the picture but in reality, it goes on my fair skin as more of a plum color.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for older ladies with lots of wrinkles because it softens the eyes.  </li>
      <li>Excellent pigmentation and long wear.  </li>

      <li>This was reasonably priced, the colors are good, and I appreciate finding the matte finish.</li>

      <li>Extremely happy with this purchase and will definitely be buying more.</li>
      <li>Fine product.</li>
      <li>The matte shadow does not accentuate wrinkles in my eyelids - and, in fact, seems to smooth them out.  </li>
      <li>Wish this was still available in stores.  </li>
      <li>I can wear just about any makeup color or formulation and pull it off (thanks to my coloring, the type of facial structure I have, good genes and good skincare)</li>
      <li>I have found a new favorite brand in Physician&#x27;s Formula!</li>
      <li>The item came in an original physicians formula package.</li>
      <li>we shouldn&#x27;t use frosted (&amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34;) eye shadow when our eyelid skin &amp;#34;matures,&amp;#34; because it collects in lines and wrinkles and makes them more noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I love this eyeshadow and is great for the days I want to wear a little bit of makeup but not look too overdone</li>
      <li>Only liked two colors, the top two.</li>
      <li>As ordered, nothing special.</li>
      <li>It is very silky and applies beautifly, its my favorite.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> While I love the colors and the fact they&#x27;re matte, this product arrived with the darkest colour crushed to a fine powder - and all over the entire product.  More than a little disappointing.</li>
    <li> So glad that the shadows are not sparkly.  I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Soft, matte colors -- perfect</li>
    <li> This was well-reviewed on myeyeshadowconsultant, but I found that the color payoff was poor and that even on my very fair skin the darker colors hardly showed up -- even when trying it over a variety of eye primers. The texture was very powdery and got all over the place regardless of what brushes I tried. Once I got it on my lids and cleaned up the inadvertent raccoon eyes, it creased like a whatchamacallit by lunchtime. I wound up giving it to a friend to see if it would work better for her (it didn&#x27;t). Next time I won&#x27;t be so trusting of a YouTube &amp;#34;Beauty Guru&amp;#34; when s/he gushes over a product, drugstore or otherwise. Verdict: Save your pennies and get the Urban Decay Naked Basics OR Lorac Skinny in Nude palettes if you want matte neutral nudes. You&#x27;ll get more product, use less of it, and have it last all day instead.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for a matte, hypoallergenic eye shadow and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except for here. The price is a little higher than other drug store eyeshadows but is the same as other physicians formula stuff. It has not bothered my sensitive eyes at all. I love this eyeshadow and is great for the days I want to wear a little bit of makeup but not look too overdone (like when I&#x27;m wearing sweats)! The darkest shade is awesome for filling in eyebrows as other reviews mentioned. The item came in an original physicians formula package. The little mirror is also convenient! I will order again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, love it!</li>
    <li> The shadows are great but one of the colors was all broken and no good</li>
    <li> I am in my 50s. This matte eyeshadow is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> This is a great eye shadow set, the colors are all useable and are some of the richest I&#x27;ve found. They do require careful blending, but they last all day.  I have found a new favorite brand in Physician&#x27;s Formula!</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow but it arrived cracked. Two of the four colors were damaged</li>
    <li> PERFECT FOR US 50 YEARS PLUS WOMEN</li>
    <li> I have used this particular Physicians Formula Matte Collection for years &amp; find&lt;br /&gt;it to be perfect for everyday wear without being irritating to my eye area.  Glad I&lt;br /&gt;was able to locate this item via Amazon - hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Great eyeshadows long lasting. For a natural look these are perfect, colors go easily from day to evening and look great.</li>
    <li> Works great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This arrived broken and I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eyeshadows on market.  It is even better than the high priced department store brands.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time, was well packaged, and was exactly what I wanted.  The colors go on smooth and blend very well.  This product does not leave the eye looking crepey which is an added bonus. I highly recommend this product and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought it because it&#x27;s labeled hypoallergenic.  I had the same reaction as i did to all my other eye shadows.  If it weren&#x27;t for the allergies I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very difficult (impossible) to buy a matte eyeshadow over-the-counter so I was very happy to find this.  I work 12 hour days, and the eyeshadow looks just as good at the end of the day as the beginning!  No touchups needed.  Also, I am older and this product does not settle into the creases.  Extremely happy with this purchase and will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> been using this for years. like the colors and finish</li>
    <li> I like the product but was unhappy that it had arrived broken.</li>
    <li> I have brown eyes and admittedly no \\&quot;spring chicken\\&quot;. I love my eye makeup but have found that the ever popular iridescent or sparkly eye shadows (while lovely) just accentuates every aging eye crinkle.  I&#x27;ve gone to major beauty departments and actually been laughed at when asking for matte shadows.&lt;br /&gt;These colors work great for brown eyes. Can go from very natural to decently intense. A bit chalkier than I would like so works better over moisturizer and eyeshadow base.  And of corse the colors require careful blending, but that&#x27;s a given.&lt;br /&gt;I love this shadow quad and they are have become so hard to find locally that I am stocking up</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy cheaper drugstore type makeup but I thought I&#x27;d give this a try, and it&#x27;s hard to find matte eye-shadows (especially in a pallet). I normally use MAC-Omega Eyeshadow for my eyebrows but the top left brown is about the same color and goes on pretty smooth on eyebrows and eyelid. I use the light shadow (top right) for right under my eyebrow, paired with all sorts of my other colors. I also use the browns with a eyeliner brush to line my eyeliner under my bottom lashes. Use this pallet everyday in one form or another. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is truly a MATTE color. I am 51 and the last thing I need is eye shadow that shimmers and shines getting caught in my wrinkles. I was distraught when my local Rite Aid, CVS, Target, etc., quit carrying the quad case and went instead to the long multi color shimmer. I finally found it on Amazon and am thrilled and will be stock piling this color quad. It goes on easy, blends easily and makes for a beautiful neutral eye.</li>
    <li> Love...Love...Love. This is the only eyeshadow that looks good on me, with my age and skin color.&lt;br /&gt;  So much so that if they quit selling this item I would be hurting. It is the matte that makes it not look bad on older people.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product. It is so hard to find matte eye shadows in stores. They all have shimmer, sparkles etc. which I do not like at all. My daughter introduced me the Physicians Formula when she bought one for me for Christmas and I loved it so I have purchased on line and will do again.</li>
    <li> does the job without sparkles</li>
    <li> I use these just about every day.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find a matte product such as this one in the store.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it here on Amazon.  The four colors blend together very well.  The color in the lower right hand corner looks like a brown in the picture but in reality, it goes on my fair skin as more of a plum color.  The only one I don&#x27;t use as much is the white one because it&#x27;s really white.  I use the other two brown ones all the time and I will definitely repurchase this.  I do put a bit of shadow primer on prior to applying these and they last all day.  I also use an eye shadow brush with them, not the brush that came with the product.  I just like a natural look and the eye shadow brush gives me that.  I&#x27;m a woman in her 50&#x27;s and these do not crease up on my lid like most other shadows do.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Also,  excellent seller!</li>
    <li> I prefer matte eye shadow and it&#x27;s difficult to find in the colors that I like.  This is perfect and affordable!</li>
    <li> Matte eye shadows (which I prefer) are difficult to find.  I like the earth tone colors very much but the product bothers my eyes, makes them red and watery.</li>
    <li> Love the color and texture of this eye shadow. It is very silky and applies beautifly, its my favorite.</li>
    <li> The shadow is fine but the applicator is cheap and the ends repeatedly fell off, then they tore completely while there was still a lot of shadow left.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought it through Amazon. I love matte eyeshadows but there are just not too many out there and these are the best I&#x27;ve found. I love it and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes matte eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> Colors are perfect for subtle everyday wear.  This product does not tend to clump or concentrate in lid fold.  It has a study compact an easy opener.</li>
    <li> I have light ash brown hair, fair cool skin (pink undertone) and blue eyes.  I prefer not to wear sparkly or glittery makeup because I am in my mid-thirties and matte colors look a bit better on slightly-aging eyelids.  I also want to be taken seriously and sometimes brazen makeup colors can prevent that from happening.  I have a \\&quot;remember the woman herself, not the wild makeup/clothes/hair she has on\\&quot; philosophy when it comes to beauty.  This palette works fine for that look- modest, calm, understated.  However...on someone of my cool coloring, it can appear dull and make me look rather tired.  It seems to make my very light dark circles under my eyes look worse than they really are and doesn&#x27;t accent my blue eyes all that well.  I can wear just about any makeup color or formulation and pull it off (thanks to my coloring, the type of facial structure I have, good genes and good skincare)...but this makes me look a little blah.  I think it&#x27;d be better suited to a woman with green (or maybe brown) eyes, warmer skin, warmer hair color.  For women with cool coloring (black, cool red, ash blonde or ash brown hair), a pink undertone to their skin (as opposed to yellow, brown, olive or tan) and blue or grey eyes, I just don&#x27;t think that this would be a spectacular choice in color palette.  Obviously some will disagree and that&#x27;s okay- I&#x27;m just basing this on personal experience.  It does possess a lovely matte finish for those who look good with this neutral set of color choices.  Finding an eyeshadow quad with an all-matte finish to each color is quite difficult, especially in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product itself REALLY needs some work.  It&#x27;s been flaky since day one (and it was fresh when I opened it, not old or rancid) and the powder goes EVERYWHERE.  So much of the product goes to waste due to this.  I use high-end makeup brushes, not cheap sponge applicators, so that&#x27;s not the problem.  The color saturation on the lids is only moderate at best.  I&#x27;m not a makeup line snob- if I can get away with using a drugstore product, I will.  I&#x27;m on a limited budget, so I love drugstore finds that work well.  But I have to admit that in terms of not flaking and the color intensity once applied, Lancome and Estee Lauder eyeshadows blow this stuff away.  My Lancome eyeshadow quads last forever because I don&#x27;t lose half the product to the wind!  If you wear this, you must tap the brush off before putting on the eyes because otherwise the powder will fall on your cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The durability is just okay, too.  I have fairly dry skin.  Oily breakthrough is never a problem on my eyelids or facial skin and I don&#x27;t use eye cream or anything like that.  I also prep my eyelids with foundation and pressed translucent powder before putting on shadow, which always helps product last longer on my lids.  Even Maybelline eyeshadow lasts all day on me!  But this product?  Gone within four to six hours from my eyes no matter what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is not worth the money for me.  Were it reformulated to be better quality, I&#x27;d give it four or five stars.  The color choice doesn&#x27;t work for me, but I wouldn&#x27;t remove stars for that because that&#x27;s just a personal thing.  At this point, I&#x27;d have to say one should either shell out the bucks for a matte palette in a better department store line of makeup or use a drugstore product and most likely put up with the shimmer that seems to be in nearly every eyeshadow quad these days.&#x27;m not a makeup line snob- if I can get away with using a drugstore product, I will.  I&#x27;m on a limited budget, so I love drugstore finds that work well.  But I have to admit that in terms of not flaking and the color intensity once applied, Lancome and Estee Lauder eyeshadows blow this stuff away.

I have fairly dry skin.  Oily breakthrough is never a problem on my eyelids or facial skin and I don&#x27;t use eye cream or anything like that.  I also prep my eyelids with foundation and pressed translucent powder before putting on shadow, which always helps product last longer on my lids.  Even Maybelline eyeshadow lasts all day on me!  But this product?  Gone within four to six hours from my eyes no matter what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is not worth the money for me.  Were it reformulated to be better quality, I&#x27;d give it four or five stars.  The color choice doesn&#x27;t work for me, but I wouldn&#x27;t remove stars for that because that&#x27;s just a personal thing.  At this point, I&#x27;d have to say one should either shell out the bucks for a matte palette in a better department store line of makeup or use a drugstore product and most likely put up with the shimmer that seems to be in nearly every eyeshadow quad these days.</li>
    <li> product arrived damaged so I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> I read somewhere we shouldn&#x27;t use frosted (&amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34;) eye shadow when our eyelid skin &amp;#34;matures,&amp;#34; because it collects in lines and wrinkles and makes them more noticeable.  Sure enough, I started noticing my frosted eye shadow (although I&#x27;ve always worn light brown) was indeed making my eyes look &amp;#34;older.&amp;#34;  I was hesitant to buy eye shadow that had no sparkle, but I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product.  The matte shadow does not accentuate wrinkles in my eyelids - and, in fact, seems to smooth them out.  The shadow is very silky, and this color palette really makes my green eyes pop.  I&#x27;m glad I switched to matte shadow, and I&#x27;m very happy with this particular brand.  Highly recommended..</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t settle it or crease on the over-40 eyelid. Also, the colors blend very well. My eyes are green and typically look better with colors with more of a purplish/reddish undertone--but these muted &amp;#34;canyon&amp;#34; colors are a nice compliment. I even use the darkest one for filling in my brows. I&#x27;ll buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Nice colors with matt finish. Stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local CVS after seeing a review by MyEyeShadowConsultant on Youtube. She&#x27;s right, it is an awesome eyeshadow quad. The shadows are really high quality. Glad I purchased it. The other quads weren&#x27;t available at my CVS, so I&#x27;ll have to order them from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good product, good value, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had bought this previously when I was looking for matte eye shadow, and I really liked it. So, I thought I would pick this up again when I was in the market for matte shadow. It has very good coverage, applies easily. All four shades are matte. It lasts all day. I would definitely recommend this. It also blends well with eye shadows that have shimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, although it does crease after around 6 hours even with a good quality primer. Probably best for neutral and cool skintones.</li>
    <li> As ordered, nothing special.</li>
    <li> Love this shadow!!!  I complements my eye color perfectly and goes on very smoothly.  I am going to order again with a different color pallette.</li>
    <li> This is by far the greatest color combination ever produced!</li>
    <li> I have used this collection for years. It gets harder to find in the store what with all the new items but this combination is great for everyday use. It is matte meaning it doesn&#x27;t collect in the creases in my face.</li>
    <li> This is a high pigment eye shadow and it is matte which seems to be hard to find, and the drug store I shop at canyon Classic was the only matte they carry from physician formula. I really like this eyeshadow it is long lasting and the colors really show up. No sparkles! :)</li>
    <li> I have used Physician&#x27;s Formula eye shadow for years.  It is reasonably priced and works just as well as higher priced products of the same type.&lt;br /&gt;This particular matte finish is difficult to find in stores now, so ordering online is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I had read good reviews of this product but was disappointed that the darkest shade in the pan applied much lighter on the eye. Also, the darkest purple shade applies quite sheer and requires quite a bit of effort to get a suitably dark application. This is despite my packing on the powder onto my eye crease. The lighter shades are better, especially the lightest shade. It goes on quite smoothly with good colour application. Overall, if considering this or the Quartz collection quad, I would recommend the Quartz quad as the dark shade applies very smoothly and is quite buttery in texture and application. I certainly would not re-purchase this unless I was looking for matte taupe colours, of which the mid tone colours would be fit. I also expected better colour payoff and easier application. Also, after 1.5 weeks, the powder is crumbling in some of the pans. Not sure if this is because I got an old pan or just the quality of the eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> finally found a matte eyeshadow that doesn&#x27;t come off after an hour.</li>
    <li> THE COLORS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE WEBSITE.  THERE ARE FOUR SECTIONS WITH ONLY THREE COLORS.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites. Lasts all day for us but we use an eyeshadow base before applying this so I&#x27;m sure that helps it stay put. Love all the colors. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I would hardly call parabens natural...check the ingredients.  That is of course if you are searching for something natural and chemical free.</li>
    <li> Love the matte eyeshadow and the color combination of this set.  Happy that there is not one shimmer or glitter based shadow included.  Easy to apply, easy to blend.  Excellent pigmentation and long wear.  Overall its my favorite everyday shadow set but I would like less fallout during application. It doesn&#x27;t matter, this eyeshadow collection is worth it.</li>
    <li> love this four colors can use the dark gray for eyeliner</li>
    <li> As an older woman (64) that still works, I find that the matte eye shadows are best.  This is one of the best that I have found.  I will continue to order this from Amazon since I can&#x27;t find it in any of the stores I frequent.  The color is just right for my complexion.  It lasts all day.  It doesn&#x27;t crease as some products do.  I like the matte rather than the shiny, shimmery colors that younger women wear.</li>
    <li> good shadow colors....arrived on time</li>
    <li> The matte colors are great but by the end of the day, I have creases in my lids so it&#x27;s a but creamer than I want.</li>
    <li> Wish this was still available in stores.  Long wear and classic neutral colors.</li>
    <li> THis is all I use.  It&#x27;s great for older ladies with lots of wrinkles because it softens the eyes.  I also use the color in the top left corner for my brown eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I love how the colour is matte. I can use it to contour my nose, and high light my nose bridge. When I want something natural for my eyes, I can use this too. Love it. It&#x27;s really hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect it to be \\&quot;Chemical free\\&quot; product, so this one is perfect. I just wish it is a little lower price (6CAD). Got it from a Drug store for 10CAD</li>
    <li> The matte finish and natural colors are perfect for me. it is my go-to shadow for day or night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and replenish my supplies in case it is discontinued.  Goes on easy and stays on.</li>
    <li> Perfect consistency and nice Matt finish.</li>
    <li> My favorite matte eyeshadow.  When used with Urban Decay eyeshadow primer, this eyeshadow will stay on at least 14 hours and I live in the hot, hot South!</li>
    <li> was broken into pieces when it arrived, had to return it.</li>
    <li> better than the image shows, product is quality packaged, and is a good size, bigger than expected. the colors are Exactly what i wanted, stays on all day, and is neutral enough for work. looks like a natural skin pigment. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Long lasting and natural! I like the fact that it is matte, and it doesn&#x27;t wear out or smudge!</li>
    <li> I love the matte eyeshadow..</li>
    <li> Had a hard time finding any matte finish eyeshadow. This was reasonably priced, the colors are good, and I appreciate finding the matte finish.</li>
    <li> Best matte colors ever.</li>
    <li> Easy to travel with, colors are great for me, product did arrive with 2 of 4  eye colors cracked</li>
    <li> So nice to find matte shadow</li>
    <li> I wanted matte shadows but these just didn&#x27;t give my eyes enough color. The darker color on this is not dark at all.</li>
    <li> For some reason, it&#x27;s hard to find matte eyeshadow in stores. I love this. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fair skinned daugher and wanted her to have a soft, everyday look.  This quad does a great job of giving that popular &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Fine product. I am sensitive and this brand always works for me.</li>
    <li> The colors are subtle and appropriate for everyday wear or in a work environment.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how creamy and smooth they went on.&lt;br /&gt;Not cheap or flaky at all, these are great eyeshadows that I&#x27;m always reaching for.</li>
    <li> Is a very good product. I live in the Caribbean, so it has to be reapplied occasionally (because of the humidity). The two brownish colors are almost the same, but they are very good if you are looking for a natural look.</li>
    <li> Great product have gotten before and would get again</li>
    <li> The darkest color is much darker in person than shown on the screen. Also, it is a little flaky/dusty.</li>
    <li> These colors are perfect for my pale skin and work well for a dramatic look using water on my brush for a liner. The two tan shades are just right as to enhance my eyebrows (dark blonde).</li>
    <li> I love matte eyeshadows and these were great, nice pigmentation. My only issue is the applicator is completely useless and comes apart after just one use. Just use a brush and you&#x27;re set!</li>
    <li> Great eyeshadow. Lasts all day, blends well. Colors are soft brown matte. Perfect for the 55+ crowd--no creasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some reviewers have mentioned, use your own eyeshadow applicator. The applicator included didn&#x27;t last make it through my second application.</li>
    <li> The best eye shadows.. It&#x27;s matte which I love! Ive been using this for years..</li>
    <li> Only liked two colors, the top two.</li>
</ol>
