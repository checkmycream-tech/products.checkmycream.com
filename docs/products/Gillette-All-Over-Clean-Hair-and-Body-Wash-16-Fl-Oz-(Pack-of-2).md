      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>Great Product and works well as both shampoo and a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good price and is really awesome to take on trips or vacations.&lt;br /&gt;Bought for $4.00 a bottle</li>
      <li>This product does a great job of cleaning and smells great.</li>
      <li>Also great as a bubble bath.</li>
      <li>Got it for a great price, and lo and behold</li>
      <li>works great, gives protection throughout the day...</li>
      <li>- if that happens then this is a 5 star item!), and has a very nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>With Subsribe &amp; Save and an Amazon coupon, this 2-pack is a good price.</li>
      <li>good product for the price paid.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think these shower gels are rocket science or in need of over-complication, but it smells good and does \\&quot;the job\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as good as it does when using a stand alone hair shampoo.</li>
      <li>good price.  </li>
      <li>this shampoo smells so good that i feel refreshed for hours</li>
      <li>so my breath would smell good</li>
      <li>Good body wash</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing fancy or amazing but just what you&#x27;d get if you were buying it at a drug store.</li>
      <li>Good product, love it</li>
      <li>Great lather and nice clean scent.</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.  </li>
      <li>a mouthwash  gonna buy more when this runs out</li>
      <li>Packaging could have been better though.  </li>
      <li>It washes very nicely and the scent is incredibly strong when cleaning but just the right amount of scent after the shower.</li>
      <li>Keeps things easy.</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>
      <li>Pros: smells great, leaves a refreshing scent that lasts all day, and is relatively cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>Would recommend for anyone looking for a decent body scrub at a good price.</li>
      <li>and it is so strong that i don&#x27;t need deoderant</li>
      <li>Best for showering at a gym right after a workout, don&#x27;t need 2 different bottles for hair and body.</li>
      <li>Smells clean, you feel clean...  </li>
      <li>: Just super foamy when you use it with a lufa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The difference between Head &amp; Shoulders and this shampoo is very evident.</li>
      <li>totally worth it.</li>
      <li>Got this because the two pack was $3 or so, will use it up and purchase again for body wash if the price is right but will get a separate shampoo.</li>
      <li>I would buy again if the price was right</li>
      <li>it just doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair very well.</li>
      <li>It smells good, though I would prefer a non-scented or less scented one.</li>
      <li>but im pretty sure there might be cheaper deals at your local store.</li>
      <li>In short, smells nice, no dandruf and no SCUM at all in the shower after weeks of using it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this, and really like it!</li>
      <li>Clean, soft, manageable.</li>
      <li>Clean and not dried</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE 2012-02-12: After using this awhile, I do not like it as much as I did at first, so I am reducing my rating to 3 stars...</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>the results seem to be much better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>is the light blue cap .....</li>
      <li>I am able to both wash my body and my hair at the same tiem, leaving a masculine scent.  </li>
      <li>This is a lot better than any other shampoo that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems to clean well enough, and has lots of suds, maybe even to the point of being too \\&quot;sudsy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>but you get so much i might be dead first.</li>
      <li>I may never go back to all of my old products.</li>
      <li>I recently came home after major surgery.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best smelling hair+body wash I could find. Best for showering at a gym right after a workout, don&#x27;t need 2 different bottles for hair and body. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this solely as a body wash and likes it well enough. With Subsribe &amp; Save and an Amazon coupon, this 2-pack is a good price.</li>
    <li> It is what it is.  It washes very nicely and the scent is incredibly strong when cleaning but just the right amount of scent after the shower.</li>
    <li> Good body wash but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as good as it does when using a stand alone hair shampoo. Got this because the two pack was $3 or so, will use it up and purchase again for body wash if the price is right but will get a separate shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great Product and works well as both shampoo and a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good price and is really awesome to take on trips or vacations.&lt;br /&gt;Bought for $4.00 a bottle but im pretty sure there might be cheaper deals at your local store.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product.  Can&#x27;t beat all in one hair and body wash convenience.  Packaging could have been better though.  Product came in with make shift box made up of pieces of cardboard and so bottle leaked some since packaging was crushed.</li>
    <li> Very good product. In short, smells nice, no dandruf and no SCUM at all in the shower after weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job of cleaning and smells great. I have it on automatic shipping.Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Pros: smells great, leaves a refreshing scent that lasts all day, and is relatively cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Just super foamy when you use it with a lufa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Get it. You will get all the ladies.</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this 2 in 1 hair and body wash, I look forward to showering.  I am able to both wash my body and my hair at the same tiem, leaving a masculine scent.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I finally ordered a bunch of All Over from Amazon because sometimes I can&#x27;t find it locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My body: Clean and not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;My hair: Clean, soft, manageable. This is a lot better than any other shampoo that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I can&#x27;t give it 6 starts.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I recently came home after major surgery. I needed to wash every day. I did not want to bother with all the products I had been using to shampoo and wash before the surgery. In the hospital they used an all-in-one product to wash me and shampoo my hair. I searched online and found this product. It works just as I hoped. I may never go back to all of my old products.</li>
    <li> Good product, love it</li>
    <li> I like this combo shampoo/body wash. It smells good, though I would prefer a non-scented or less scented one. It seems to clean well enough, and has lots of suds, maybe even to the point of being too \\&quot;sudsy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like to use a conditioner or shampoo with conditioner after using this... the results seem to be much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2012-02-12: After using this awhile, I do not like it as much as I did at first, so I am reducing my rating to 3 stars... it just doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair very well. The difference between Head &amp; Shoulders and this shampoo is very evident. Perhaps when you try to be a shampoo and body wash at the same time something has to suffer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this, and really like it! It does not leave my skin dry and itchy (and I hope this continues even in Winter of Arizona - if that happens then this is a 5 star item!), and has a very nice fragrance. I would recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> Got it for a great price, and lo and behold it&#x27;s a great product! I don&#x27;t think these shower gels are rocket science or in need of over-complication, but it smells good and does \\&quot;the job\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> works great, gives protection throughout the day... Smells clean, you feel clean...  Dont get it in your eyes.  what else can one say?</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.  It&#x27;s nothing fancy or amazing but just what you&#x27;d get if you were buying it at a drug store.</li>
    <li> good price.  Wife likes scent.  Would recommend for anyone looking for a decent body scrub at a good price. recommended</li>
    <li> Keeps things easy. Can now take two of these travelling instead of a shampoo and a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well on my hair and my body. Can&#x27;t tell this apart from my regular shampoo Tresemme.</li>
    <li> this shampoo smells so good that i feel refreshed for hours and it is so strong that i don&#x27;t need deoderant any more.i just wish that they made a toothpaste that smelled like this so my breath would smell good too.or a mouthwash  gonna buy more when this runs out but you get so much i might be dead first. thanks</li>
    <li> The Body Wash works ok. But is no better than cheaper stuff I get at walmart. I would buy again if the price was right</li>
    <li> This is not right shampoo it&#x27;s not the dark blue cap .....is the light blue cap .....that&#x27;s u get....</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with this liquid soap. Great lather and nice clean scent. I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> good product for the price paid. cleans well. bigger bottle. easy to use. totally worth it. will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Got this for our son, he seemed to like it.</li>
    <li> This tuff goes a long way. Makes a lot of suds and lasts a long time. Also great as a bubble bath.</li>
