### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!!</li>
      <li>Best I bought for home treatments!!</li>
      <li>The results are immediate and long-lasting. :D</li>
      <li>I would also like to add that the ampules are great because they allow you to control where you&#x27;re applying the whitening gel.</li>
      <li>I read reviews online, saw reviews in Good Housekeeping Magaziine and saw a review on TV also.</li>
      <li>I have been happy with most things I have purchased through Amazon</li>
      <li>They work amazingly.</li>
      <li>I think if your teeth are more stained, you&#x27;ll probably get better results</li>
      <li>You can do a lot better for the money.</li>
      <li>The GO SMiLE Whitening Light System is amazing!</li>
      <li>I did not notice much of a significant change after using this system.  </li>
      <li>The light is just a plain, bright LED, and is more for show than for its effectiveness.  </li>
      <li>Im sad to say my smiles not white and bright anymore, but i should be getting more soon :D</li>
      <li>I have been reading customer ratings on different areas of the Internet and this product has gotten pretty good ratings</li>
      <li>I did not experience any sensitivity with GO SMiLE.  </li>
      <li>The whitening solution does not work any better than the generic store brand.  </li>
      <li>I was a smoker, so I had more discoloration on my upper and lower teeth on the right-side; I was able to apply a second layer of gel to those teeth.  </li>
      <li>exactly but no change in color.  </li>
      <li>I got this for Christmas last year and fell in love.</li>
      <li>I did exactly what the directions said to do</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the normal $120 price tag, so if you can get it for cheaper go for it.</li>
      <li>I purchased the intense stain removal.  </li>
      <li>This product really does whiten your teeth with just one application.  </li>
      <li>I do not have very stained teeth, however, I could use some whitening of my teeth.  </li>
      <li>I think I would have gotten much brighter if I had used baking</li>
      <li>I got the whitening light and ampoules and an extra case of them.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes!  </li>
      <li>but this did not cause too much pain to my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thankfully I didn&#x27;t pay too much.</li>
      <li>The whitening formula that goes on your teeth feels pretty strong, so be careful not to get it on your gums!</li>
      <li>I have fairly good oral hygiene, have been at the dentist every half year for cleaning for the last 8 years.  </li>
      <li>Normally this product is twice as much money.</li>
      <li>Just got my GO Smile system and tried it out last night.</li>
      <li>so they are already pretty white.</li>
      <li>After using less than 24 ampules, the mouthpiece of the light wouldn&#x27;t stay connected without holding it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see a very noticeable difference in the coloring of my teeth, but I&#x27;ve been doing the Crest White strips before this</li>
      <li>4 treatments later they look exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>It is thin and runny, and more tends to leak out than stays in the tray.  </li>
      <li>usually have pretty sensitive gums</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll burn at first, but that will dissipate after a few minutes.</li>
      <li>I mainly used Crest Whitestrips in the past, but I had stopped seeing a difference in the color of my teeth; plus, they were making my teeth extremely sensitive.</li>
      <li>I think this product is a waste of money or maybe only works for a certain type of tooth.</li>

    <li> I do not have very stained teeth, however, I could use some whitening of my teeth.  I did not notice much of a significant change after using this system.  I think I would have gotten much brighter if I had used baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have pretty sensitive gums but this did not cause too much pain to my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again due to the lack of results.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas last year and fell in love. I got the whitening light and ampoules and an extra case of them. They work amazingly. I ran out of them but they lasted a long time, I just happened to share with everybody. Im sad to say my smiles not white and bright anymore, but i should be getting more soon :D Try it just once and you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
    <li> The GO SMiLE Whitening Light System is amazing! I have used numerous teeth whitening systems and this product takes the cake. I mainly used Crest Whitestrips in the past, but I had stopped seeing a difference in the color of my teeth; plus, they were making my teeth extremely sensitive. I did not experience any sensitivity with GO SMiLE.  In regards to whitening power, I did have to use three treatments (9 ampules) in a row to see dramatic results. Not very responsible, I know, but what the hey, I wanted white teeth. Basically, I abused these ampules to an extreme and yet still did not experience any sensitivity. If I would have pulled something like that with Crest Whitestrips, I would have been walking around with Sensodyne toothpaste caked on my teeth for a week. I would also like to add that the ampules are great because they allow you to control where you&#x27;re applying the whitening gel. I was a smoker, so I had more discoloration on my upper and lower teeth on the right-side; I was able to apply a second layer of gel to those teeth.  Anyway, I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for celeb white teeth. The results are immediate and long-lasting. :D</li>
    <li> I was very, very disappointed with this product. I read reviews online, saw reviews in Good Housekeeping Magaziine and saw a review on TV also. I tried this product five times. I had NO results whatsoever. For almost $200 I consider this a collosal waste of my hard earned money!!!!!! I have been happy with most things I have purchased through Amazon but this is the WORST!!!!!! I can&#x27;t say enough! I wish I had never bought this piece of crap! I wish I could return it but I suppose I have waited too long. I would never, never, never recommend this. It is junk!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes after using this product. I don&#x27;t have horribly stained teeth anyway but I would like a shade lighter. Normally this product is twice as much money. Thankfully I didn&#x27;t pay too much.</li>
    <li> Rec&amp;#34;d for Christmas, saw results after 1st treatment! I would recommend! Def. whiter and brighter. Takes 30 minutes but no pain, no gain!</li>
    <li> The whitening solution does not work any better than the generic store brand.  It is thin and runny, and more tends to leak out than stays in the tray.  The light is just a plain, bright LED, and is more for show than for its effectiveness.  You can do a lot better for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this in Jan. 2012 when it debuted on QVC and purchased ampule refils recently on Amazon. I have been whitening for a long time, so not sure how dramatic results are supposed to be. My use was maintenance. After using less than 24 ampules, the mouthpiece of the light wouldn&#x27;t stay connected without holding it. That causes it to leak so you have to wrap a paper towel around it. Now, after 40 uses, the expensive 3 volt battery has died. Not happy. I will go back to gel from my dentist.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to just improve the color of my teeth slightly.  I have fairly good oral hygiene, have been at the dentist every half year for cleaning for the last 8 years.  It was just the color that could be a little brighter.  So I used all 12 ampoules over the last 4 weeks and nothing has happened.  I am following the instructions exactly but no change in color.  I think this product is a waste of money or maybe only works for a certain type of tooth.</li>
    <li> This product really does whiten your teeth with just one application.  It is a little messy to use but if you sit down and tilt your head back for the 10 minutes it requires its no problem.</li>
    <li> I like the shape of the container but it did not work for me. I wont be buying this item again.</li>
    <li> Just got my GO Smile system and tried it out last night. I didn&#x27;t see a very noticeable difference in the coloring of my teeth, but I&#x27;ve been doing the Crest White strips before this so they are already pretty white. The whitening formula that goes on your teeth feels pretty strong, so be careful not to get it on your gums! It&#x27;ll burn at first, but that will dissipate after a few minutes. Also, I have some tooth sensitivity today (the day after suing it). I would recommend using Sensodyn tooth paste to help combat any tooth/gum sensitivity.  I think if your teeth are more stained, you&#x27;ll probably get better results that someone like me who has already used other whitening products. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the normal $120 price tag, so if you can get it for cheaper go for it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the intense stain removal.  My teeth are not even that badly stained.  4 treatments later they look exactly the same.  The light unit is poorly built, the mouth piece keeps coming undone, wast of time (30 minutes per treatment) and money.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this thing again at any price.</li>
    <li> Well, I am dissapointed.  I have been reading customer ratings on different areas of the Internet and this product has gotten pretty good ratings so I bought this kit.  I did exactly what the directions said to do and I even did a fourth treatment.  There is hardly any change to the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep trying.  I might as well as I&#x27;ve already paid for the darn thing but I&#x27;m really not expecting a drastic whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll be spending $500 for my dentist to \\&quot;Zoom\\&quot; my teeth.  Darn it....</li>
    <li> Best I bought for home treatments!! Worked in just a few apps!! My wife  &amp;  I noticed the difference!! Great product!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes!  But even after finishing the entire 12 count viles of whitener and follwing the directions to a tee.  I am so sorry to say that this does not work.</li>
