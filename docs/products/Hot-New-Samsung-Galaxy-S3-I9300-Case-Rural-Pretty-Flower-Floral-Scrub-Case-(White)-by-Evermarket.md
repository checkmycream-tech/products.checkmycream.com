    <li> Love, love, not this exact one but another with flowers going down middle of phone, so much in fact I ordered another one because I wore out the first!</li>
    <li> Will recommend friends.</li>
    <li> Took over a month to arrive and then was damaged. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I cancel this request so no reviews</li>
    <li> It was a waste of my time and money.</li>
    <li> great case for the price!</li>
    <li> Very pretty, but poor quality!</li>
    <li> I loved it, it came in handy a lot of times when all I needed was my ID, debit card, and cash,  plus my phone of course.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t look as nice as in the picture&lt;br /&gt;broke apart fast</li>
    <li> I love my new case and all the bling. I looks like I spend a lot of my but in fact I didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> So pretty and useful it holds my money id and debit cards so I dont have to lug a purse around or search through my purse looking for my phone and other stuff......everyone ask where can I get one!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It looks very nice my girls love this case I have 2 girls they didn&#x27;t care that the other one already hadit</li>
    <li> This is just as beautiful in person as it is in the picture!  Fits my phone perfectly.  Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even gv it a 1, the jewels wasn&#x27;t on there good at all, the cat jewels came out first it look terrible! Will never buy from them again</li>
    <li> Love love love! I get sooooo many compliments on it!!!!! Totally worth the couple of dollars I spent on it.</li>
    <li> I loved my purchase it is a great item I have a friend in others that want one will be ordering others thank you very much</li>
    <li> Prior to ordering this phone case I had never used the &amp;#34;book&amp;#34; type of cover.  However I&#x27;m hooked on this type from now on.  The quality is pretty good for the price, you can&#x27;t complain.  I&#x27;ve actually had several people ask me where I got it, its definitely an eye catcher!  There are a couple of issues I&#x27;ve had with it however........The flower glued to the closure tab came off but I was able to superglue it back without any trouble and you can&#x27;t even tell it has been re-glued.  The second issue I&#x27;ve had with it is that I was trying to get my money out of the little &amp;#34;slot&amp;#34; inside the cover and the top-most edge of it ripped thru the stitching.  Since I am a seamstress as well as a crafter I was able to sew it back with some nylon thread to reinforce it and it&#x27;s functioning quite well.  I&#x27;m going to order 5 more to give to my sisters and friends who&#x27;ve commented on how much they love it.  WORTH THE PRICE!</li>
    <li> I love this case.  It is very different.  It is easily noticeable.  It make a cell phone look totally different.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The ad says this case is for a Samsung Galaxy S3, which I have, but when the case finally got delivered (which took weeks) I found out that my S3 doesn&#x27;t fit into the plastic holder inside this case.  One edge will go in there but the other side keeps popping out, no matter how you try it; the plastic holder inside is just not wide enough.  I&#x27;ve tried heating the edge of the holder and clamping it overnight to try and widen it to no avail.  Just an FYI there.  This one&#x27;s a no-go.</li>
    <li> THE FLOWER WAS MISSING ON THE LITTLE CLOSEURE FLAP - LOVE THE CATS ON THE CASE... THE FLOWER WOULD HAVE BEEN EXTRA CUTE, BUT I&#x27;LL DEAL WITH IT.</li>
    <li> when i got it, it had some pieces missing..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful....love it...it&#x27;s better than what I expected. .....super surprised of quality, beautifully crafted. ..stones are amazing ans super shiny</li>
    <li> Love this beautiful case!  If you take care of your things this will last you many case changes. I like to have new case&#x27;s every once in a while.  At these prices it&#x27;s easy.</li>
    <li> MY PHONE DOES NOT FIT.</li>
    <li> It got dirty way to fast</li>
    <li> Horrible! Don&#x27;t buy it.  It wouldn&#x27;t fit....I had to force it in and because it didn&#x27;t fit...it kept popping out.  The jewels have popped out and everything.  wasted my money</li>
    <li> Gave this one to my sister in law,  she loves the bling. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Item is as described, sent me the wrong case at first. but now my girlfriend has the correct one! Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this case and it is cracking(the leather) and chipping. The leather is cheap, whick I understand, I mean, you get what you pay for but  ...whenever the white leather rubbs up against something the color rubs off on it. I know how purple blotches on it from when it rubbed up against the inside of my purse. But when I got it, it was in perfect condition, everything securly glued, no damage during shipping. Ive had it for about a month and a half now as I write this and if ur gonna buy this, you will get your moneys worth.</li>
    <li> Took one star away because a couple of Rhine stones fell off the first day</li>
    <li> Have to put on speaker to talk because case is in the way. Should&#x27;ve had a third part to it so it will not be taken out all the time.</li>
    <li> Its very cute but two of da big diamond fell out in two weeks.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I would have given a five star if a wristlet band were included</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it. ..still in package....not what I was expecting. ..</li>
    <li> Great product. Reliable and fast shipping. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this product. I plan on purchasing more products in the near future! Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I love this case it was even nicer than U expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! I thought it would look cheap because the price was so low but it was definitely a good buy. Everyone loves it too.</li>
    <li> This is the first time this has happened my nieces buy all the time this time everything was completely wrong</li>
    <li> Very useful, fast shipper.</li>
    <li> My Aunt absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> the diamons keep on falling .</li>
    <li> All the stuff fell off and I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks... what kind of deal is that.. yea cheap n cute but dont use it.. because its just 4 looks.</li>

    <li> Cute case....but I didn&#x27;t realize it was cats...lol....not a cat lover! Fast delivery...</li>
    <li> the studs came off to easy. waste of money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know the crystals were going to be cats, but I like the case.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet but will.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong style I could not see there were cats. No my style</li>
    <li> is very beautiful and come in before time</li>
    <li> jewels fell off within 2 days</li>
    <li> Great love it do wish the magnet was a little stronger like one I bought for my mom but it works and its awesome!</li>
