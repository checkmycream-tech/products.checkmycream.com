<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I saw these plates and how they got mostly good reviews.  I saw at least one person mention that some of the designs were too small, but I figured I would be okay since I have pretty small fingers.  I was wrong.  The designs on the plates are really nice, but ALL of the full nail designs are WAY too small for my thumbs! I&#x27;m not sure how to remedy the problem, except for using small individual images on my thumbs with the rest of my nails fully stamped, but that doesn&#x27;t seem too aesthetically pleasing to me.  Since I specifically bought the plates for the full nail designs, I pretty much wasted my money on this one :(</li>
    <li> I looked into this item when my daughter asked for the \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; version whenever the comercial came on. I liked that the reveiws were a bit better and you get a bit more for about the same cost. When it came I did my nails while she was at school, and she asked why I had nail stickers on. She wanted her nails done right away and was very exited about it. I love that it can be done with nail polish and wipes right off with the base coat, instead of having a sticker stuck on for a long time becouse they don&#x27;t come off as easy. I will deffinaly be getting more someday.</li>
    <li> love this stuff seller was great</li>
    <li> received my order in 2 days. as soon as i received the package i tried out 8 of the plates and all the designs worked well. they don&#x27;t have a backing on them but the edges aren&#x27;t sharp. happy that i can purchase the dupe of konad without having to spend the money.</li>
    <li> Yes, buy these. It is for sure worth the money and not spending a ton on Konad. Some of the plates I personally would never use, but most I will. I have used about 6 of the plates thus far and the images seem to be as clear as my Konad plates. They are raw plates, so you really either need the plate holder, or I cut some craft foam into circles and glued them to the back of each plate so they stay put when I am using them. You wont regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this plates, because they were cheaper than KONAD stamping plates... first I didnt know how to use, because I did&#x27;nt know that there a foil is on the plates... when I remove this foil, It works PERFECTLY.... absolutely recomend</li>
    <li> These plates are very convenient if you don&#x27;t have allot of time to design your nails or you are not very creative these plates are perfect for you they are very easy to use and they have many different designs for you to choose from.</li>
    <li> For the price, these plates ARE a steal.  Many of the plates are dupes of Konad designs.  The plates are apparently the same as the previously released MASH plates:  m20, m21, m22, m25, m26, m27, m28, m44, m45, m46, m47, m48, m50, m52, m56, m57, m60, m61, m62, m63, m64, m72, m73, m78, m80.  You can google \\&quot;MASH  nail art plates\\&quot; to see what designs are included on each plate.    Please note, however, they are not exactly Konad quality.  The full-nail images on three of my plates, m57 (zebra/fishnet/leopard), m60 &amp; m61 are smaller in size compared to the other full-nail images &amp; there is no way they will completely cover my thumb nail.  The images on these three plates basically appear \\&quot;shrunken,\\&quot; that is the best way to explain it.  Therefore, I plan to order the Konad version of these plates since they have many of the designs I originally wanted in the first place.  I also found that a few of the full-nail images aren&#x27;t etched fully, so no matter how hard I try, I just can&#x27;t get a full, clean image to transfer to the stamper.  I ordered two Konad plates (m59 &amp; m65) with a stamper, black &amp; white special polish (more on that in a sec) &amp; I found that the actual Konad plates are definitely more cleanly/evenly etched, as they should be for the $7 retail price.  You can definitely pay less for the Konad plates on Amazon; I ordered from Nail Beauty 4U &amp; was very pleased w/their pricing, shipping &amp; customer service.)  In practicing with the plates, I tested Wet &amp; Wild French White Crème vs the Konad White Special Polish.  There definitely IS a difference, the Konad shows up more while the W&amp;W is not nearly as bright.  I didn&#x27;t try the black yet, but from what I&#x27;ve read, I expect the same theory to hold true.  So I would recommend ordering at least the Konad black &amp; white special polish with your stamper.  I&#x27;ve had good luck stamping with the following Pure Ice metallic shades:  Outrageous, Pussy Cat &amp; Silver Mercedes, as well as China Glaze Harmony, Passion &amp; Devotion.All of the China Glaze Romantique collection shades are great for stamping, btw.)  Bottom Line:  Yes, I would recommend this set to a friend, with the heads up that some of the plates may not be 100% perfect.  If you&#x27;re looking to try nail stamping, for the price, this is a great starter set.</li>
    <li> For some of the plates with whole nail designs, the imprints were SIGNIFICANTLY smaller than those on plates bought from Konad and Bundle Monster.  The designs might fit most nails but would not cover the span of a thumb or big toe nail so just be aware.  Some of the imprints also do not transfer to the stamp fully, no matter the polish, timing, or expertise.  Still a lot of the plates work fine for my needs and I think they are a good set to start out with for practicing stamping. For cleaner lines and better imprints, use Konad stamping polish and higher quality plates.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and good package. the price is also good but some of the image plates don&#x27;t work no matter what just buy and try maybe u get a good set i believe i got some defective ones but for the price i think they are good compared to konad. be careful not to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> It was nice and neatly packaged. All brand new like it said it would be. It&#x27;s mash brand, happy I got this. I got plates mash01-mash25. The images looks really nice and pretty.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m fairly new to stamping and this seemed decent enough priced. The image sizes are all over the place: some are really small and some are huge. Same with the full-nail designs: some would fit my whole thumb, others barely cover my smallest nail.  The images themselves are pretty good, some really pretty ones and most are clear cut. Others have a few flaws to them. I&#x27;ve had lots of trouble with the french tip stamps; its like they are not deep enough. Some of the edges of the plates are a little sharp, I just filed it down with a super heavy duty file.  Overall, this is a pretty good set for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any of this nail stamping art stuff but it looked so cute so I had to get myself some.  I bought these plates because they were so much cheaper than the Konad plates and figured they&#x27;d have similar designs.  Let me tell you, these plates are a steal!  They work perfectly and aside from the edges being a little sharp, they&#x27;re great!  The full nail designs fit all my nails, but are just a little too small for my thumbs (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7\\&quot; with average sized hands), however if you center it right it&#x27;s not very noticeable.  I did buy the Konad nail polish to use with these plates because I figured I&#x27;d use the real deal to make sure it worked for the first time.  My nails turned out great with the herring bone full nail design even though I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the variety of designs-there are several full nail designs (like herring bone, swirls, zebra, leopard), many single designs (like several different flowers, seasonal ones, hearts, animals, dice), and tip designs that can be stamped onto acrylics or just your natural nail.  Overall these are a great product for the price and I would highly recommend them!  Just be careful with the edges.</li>
    <li> This purchase was worth it. All plates arrive in a good amount of time. There are many designs in each plate. I thought it was going to be difficult to use but it&#x27;s very easy to clean and continue decorating nails. I&#x27;ve heard it was difficult to clean the plates but that is not true if you use a brush with acetone to get rid of the polish stuck in between the design you are using.</li>
    <li> These are the mash image plates (1-25). They are available on the mashnails website (for images). They work great and I would recommend this set of image plates.</li>
    <li> GREAT!!!!! I LOVE THESE PLATES!!!! i dont hav konad plates, but these work AMAZING!!!! they have such a big selction. with the money i spent for 25 OF THESE!!!! i would only have been able to get aout 3 konad plates. THESE WERE A STEAL!!! they work great with regualr polish to, i just did my nails for valentines day. i have to admit, i was hesitant at first. but for you non believers like i ONCE WAS, GET THEM!!!! THEY ARE A M A Z I N G!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beginner in stamping and after a few tries I am getting better. Love the designs and enjoy nail stamping. This is a very good deal.</li>
    <li> I bought these plates because the review says it is same as Knoad plates. BUT it turns out NOT!&lt;br /&gt;It is Mash plates. Most of them is same as the Bubble Monster 21pc Plates which I have already gotten! I am so so so disappointed about that. I guess just the seller has just changed images this year. Or maybe you get the images randomly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, most french nail designs are too too too big...If I print it to my nail, it will be hard to tell which picture it is, because it is too big!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After checking it, I found some of the plastic film is peel off before!! It is awful to know you get the used products without notice before.&lt;br /&gt;SO, I decide to apply for refund. I know the shipping fee is 5 dollar and I will pay about 4 more dollar to ship it back. I still want to return it. It makes me upset when I see them.</li>
    <li> Amazing value! Just as other reviews stated all but 5 of the plates are pretty much identical to the &#x27;k&#x27; plates. The only major difference that I have seen is that some of the images are a bit larger, which is actually kinda nice for layering if you end up with doubles. As for the 5 plates, they actually offer some designs that are NOT offered by &#x27;k&#x27; Shipping was quick and each plate was individually wrapped so no scratches in site! Completely worth the money. Buy it, you wont be sorry</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for the MASH plates to come back into stock here on Amazon.I have been checking Amazon every couple of days hoping I would see them back in stock. But then I came across this set of plates and decided I would take a chance and order them. I felt it was a gamble since you really don&#x27;t get to see what plates are included with this set. I am really glad I ordered these. The plates that I received are exactly the same as the MASH set of plates. The MASH listing has a picture of the plates and I compared each plate to confirm this. You can google \\&quot;MASH nail plates\\&quot; to see images of these plates that others have posted. I do like most of the designs. Many are dupes of Konad plates. Some of the plates are useless to me, and some of the images are not as crisp, but for the price I am happy overall. I did some stamping today and the image stamped perfectly. I should also mention that I have a few Konad plates and the Bundle Monster set of 25. I feel these plates stamp just as well as Konad and Bundle Monster but these don&#x27;t have any paper backing. Handled carefully this isn&#x27;t a problem. My shipping was actually fast but my notification that the item had shipped came the day before they arrived. I was starting to think they were slow to ship but it turns out they were just slow to notify me of the shipment. I am very happy with my purchase and I would consider ordering from them again if they offered a different set.</li>
    <li> I was waiting for the MASH plates to come back in-stock but it never did. I was thinking on just buying the Konad brand but really did not want to since they are $7 each. Right when I was going to place the order for Konad I came across these plates. It only had 1 review so I just placed it in my cart and waited to see other people feedback. Once it reached 3 (5*) reviews I placed the order. It took 6 days for the item to get to me. I did my Gelish gel nails last night and tried different designs from different plates. They all worked and came out great. Most of the plates are the same designs as the Konad brand. Ones that I was about to purchase for $7 each. I am so glad I waited. I did also purchase the Konad double sided stamper. I have a knock off stamper and does not perform as well as the Konad, its a must have. Also, I used regular nail polish for the plate designs. I actually tried two different brands and both worked great.</li>
    <li> Shipping was too slow for me. Other than that, this set is a pretty good investment to start with. I&#x27;m pretty new to this \\&quot;nail art stamping\\&quot; and I spent around 30 bucks with the KONAD starter. These plates are as good as the KONAD ones. without the cardboard backing. I just swap the protective film to the back for more support. One of the plates is not as detailed as the Konad one, a very subtle difference which is not a big deal.. But i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love these plates! This is my third set including both bundle monster sets.  I find this to be a great value and don&#x27;t see anything lacking in the quality off the images.  There are only two pseudo issues I have with these plates. For one, there is no protective backing on any of the plates making them a little harder to handle as you don&#x27;t want to cut yourself on the metal.  However, this can be fixed with some construction paper &amp; double sided tape. The other issue is that a few of the \\&quot;full sized\\&quot; nail images are smaller than the others meaning too narrow &amp; too short to cover an average  index finger nevermind a thumb. I remedied this by reserving them for pedicures. : )    All in all, great set for a great value. I recommend the purchase! This set includes:    ~12 independant design plates  ~  5 french tip  plates design plates  ~  5 full nail design plates &amp;  ~  3 pedicure design plates    If you don&#x27;t already own one, you will need a Konad brand rubber stamper. It seems to work better than any other brand. I prefer the double sided one personally. Also, you will need a scraper. I don&#x27;t recommend the metal Konad scraper because it just scratches up my plates. I actually just use an old plastic gift card now &amp; it works just as well and is easier to clean. If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing these I say go for it!    Happy Stamping!</li>
    <li> Its good for what its worth.  &#x3D;o) I WOULD recommend this product. Not much of variety, but stamping is nice.</li>
    <li> I wish that I could give this product a negative 5 stars. BEWARE, the plates have not been buffed and are RAZOR sharp. My 12 year old cut her hands very badly just picking these plates up and removing the protective film on the front of the plates. Skip this product and spend the extra $ on Konad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never done nail stamping before and wanted to start, so looking around at plates to buy, they&#x27;re normally around $5 per plate. When I saw this, I thought it looked too good to be true, but I ordered it anyways, and I&#x27;m glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some GREAT designs on these plates! Granted, there&#x27;s some I&#x27;ll probably never use, like the spider, seahorse, etc, but the the majority of the designs are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw someone review that the edges cut up her daughter&#x27;s hands really bad, but the edges on my plate were not all that sharp. I have absolutely no complaints about this product and would definitely recommend it for any beginners like me who don&#x27;t have any nail plates yet!</li>
    <li> This is my first set of plates and after reading the reviews I was a little hesitant but I was so happy when I received them. They are very nice plates and I have already used them a few times. I did take someone else&#x27;s advice and filed the back edge of the plates with a file because since they are mass produced there will be rough edges and the file took care of that. I received a good variety and the designs were great. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them. I got a good crisp design when I used them and like I said this was my first time. I would recommend getting these because they are good quality and you get a lot for your money!</li>
    <li> I love these  plates. They work great and you can even use regular polish to create the images. They came in bubble wrap and each plate came in their own individual bag. Whole nail designs and french tip designs are also included.They&#x27;re a great value for your money.</li>
    <li> I wish they would have posted better pictures of the plates because I ordered these mostly because of the cute customer pictures that pull up with the pictures of the overlayed plate pics. Had I known that I wouldn&#x27;t get the designs I thought would come with this kit I probably wouldn&#x27;t have ordered them. The whole nail images are alot smaller than other plates I purchased from Red Angel, but have smoother edges and less noticeable scratches. There were also 7 plates with just fingertip designs on them that I might never even use along with several of the designs on the other plates. Not real impressed with this purchase, but I&#x27;m hoping I might feel better after I try them out. Hope this helps some of you other potential customers to make a more informed decision about purchases you make.</li>
    <li> If you are a beginner and you are just starting to buy plates, this is perfect for you. I have a HUGE collection and I thought what I was getting was completely different. There was a specific plate i saw in the photo, of the pile of plates, that I wanted so i ordered the set. I got it... didn&#x27;t get the plate I wanted... ended up getting all the ones i already have and I realized that all of the plates I got were none of the ones shown in the photo. It was a bit of false advertisement for me so I really feel they should show the plates you will be getting. On the bright side, my neices and sister in law are going to fully enjoy the plates to add to their collections, since I already have them all.</li>
    <li> Great price. Fantastically fast shipping! I&#x27;m ecstatic! THANK YOU!&lt;br /&gt;My set of 25 came with 8 full nail design plates 5 french tip plates and 12 independent design plates &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005F5HHL0 NAIL ART IMAGE PLATES POLISH STAMP STAMPING MIXED DESIGNS SET KIT 25pc]]</li>
    <li> I received these image plates today and am DELIGHTED with them! As another reviewer stated, all but five of the plates are IDENTICAL to the \\&quot;k company\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve saved a boatload of money and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this set.  I hope they release another set soon!  Buy this, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I got my plates the next week that i ordered them , came very quickly. the problem is,it is very hard to find nail polish that will pick up the design. i find a women on u tube that use the plates. i will keep trying till i find one that works. the nial posih that come swiht it is expensive .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely great and all, and I bought the scraper/roll thing of Konad but I wish SOMEONE told me that I need to buy Konad Special Polish! Now I have to wait in order to use it with the Konad Special Polish White for it to work or otherwise other nail polish WON&#x27;T WORK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria</li>
    <li> I absoulutley love this product it works so well. At first i didnt think it worked but the rerason why is because the blue sheet over the plate has to be removed before use!! lol it works great now and i have no complaints. You should deffinitely buy these image plates they rock! &lt;3</li>
    <li> I was first introduced with nail art stamping from my friend who had the konad brand..i finally decided to buy my own image plates..which were not these..they were really bad and didn&#x27;t work at all. I recently decided to buy these because all the reviews said they were the same as the MASH one&#x27;s, which i wanted! These came within 3 days! And i love it! It works really well..and i love all the designs! You should definitely buy these!!!</li>
    <li> These shipped very fast. They are the old Mash plates even coming in mash packaging and having mash backing on them. A lot of very cute designs though most of the full nail images are pretty small. Then again I do have pretty long nails but they are small width wise too. I still recommend this product though for the value and what you get. Still a great value for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> These image plates are basically the same from MASH. They came in the same packaging just with the MASH part cut off. They&#x27;re a perfect gift if you don&#x27;t already have the 25 set piece from MASH.</li>
    <li> I ordered these based on other reviews that said they were the exact same design as the Konad, but sadly they were not.  I mean the images on some were exactly the same, but just shrunk down to a smaller size.  It was weird, some image plates seemed to be a normal size, and some (especially the whole nail ones) were entirely too small to be used for the whole nail.  I do have some of the Konad plates, and putting the exact same Konad up against the same design on these you can definitely see there is quite a size difference.    I still can&#x27;t complain, because even if only half of them are usable, it is still a pretty good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Most of the images stamp pretty decently. Some are unrecognizable and you have to squint to try and decide what it is, but for the price and the amount of images you get it&#x27;s a bargain. Overall, I was happy with this set. Some designs are super cute.</li>
    <li> So i got them today and i already have the exact same set...thanks to the ppl who listed the wrong plates humph! but gladly i was planning on giving them as a gift so i don&#x27;t mind but i was hoping for new designs...oh well....but here is whats inside the set:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They include: m20, m21, m22,m25, 26, m27, m28, m44, m45, m46, m47, m48, m50, m52, m56, m57, m60, m61, m62, m63, m64, m72, m73, m78, m80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they stamp great btw</li>
    <li> these are a dup for konad plates, but the full nail designs are quite smaller and it doesnt cover my whole thumb. The stencil is not very deep so i can transfer my image very easily and i dont even have to use konad polishes. I recommend e.l.f. polishes with these plates..</li>
    <li> was not what I expected, did not very well.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping.  Have not had any issues with the images I have tried so far. Full nail designs are a bit small</li>
    <li> the amount of designs you get with this pack is unreal, and the quality is great....the price is also a deal in itself</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed with this nail plate kit. There are varied designs, some simple, and others more complex. I&#x27;m a beginner at this, so I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards the more simplistic designs, but have really got the hold of how to do it after reading reviews on this and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good advice to remove the blue plastic. This takes awhile, but I found that it is a good way to ooh and ahh over the designs. I haven&#x27;t removed the white bottom sticker, and it still fits into my nail plate holder just fine (I bought the Konad stamper, scraper, and holder set). The etching on the designs seems deep enough - I&#x27;ve experimented with the special Konad Polishes, salon polishes (Zoya, Julep, etc), as well as department store polishes. I&#x27;ve found that Zoya glitter polishes work awesomely, as do the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails polishes. I wish I&#x27;d known this before ordering a slew of the Konad Special polishes, but I got them cheap enough I&#x27;ll chalk it up to a lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been also playing around with gel nails - so I&#x27;ll do my gel nails gelly sandwich style (cured gel foundation, regular polish, cured gel topcoat), and then play around with the stamps on top of my cured nails. That way if they turn out wonky I can wipe it off with non-acetone polish remover and start again without worrying about ruining my base coat. I put a clear coat of regular polish on top once I&#x27;m done, and then I can switch it out multiple times with the wear of the gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would note (as others have as well), if you buy the stamping kits, don&#x27;t bother with the included scraper. I couldn&#x27;t get a clean scrape with it, and all it did was scratch my plates up. I use an old credit card, and it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and enjoy - this is such a fun little hobby. All of my girlfriends now are having me practice my stamps on them, and are buying their own sets as well!.</li>
    <li> I have had these plates for a few months now. Many of the designs do not transfer because the design itself isn&#x27;t deep enough in the plates. Some of the work but not all of them. I ordered the Bundle Monster sets and they are much better quality for nearly the same price. If you want all of your plates to work but don&#x27;t want to spend the money for konad, try the bundle monster ones instead.</li>
    <li> Had these a long time and still love them</li>
    <li> I have super tiny nails and still the plate won&#x27;t cover my thumb nail, but you see people with different designs on different nails all the time so I can work with them.  You get a whole lot of designs for your money.</li>
    <li> If you missed out on the Mash plates then these are the exact same plates. Since there aren&#x27;t any  pictures to see the designs on the plates, I went ahead and ordered hoping they wouldn&#x27;t turn out to be the same as my Mash one&#x27;s but they were. Now I have two sets but I will give it away as a gift. Still a good deal and highly recommend.    Update: These image plates have Konad&#x27;s designs on them. The image plates are labeled the same as Konad. They are: m20, m21, m22, m25, m26, m27, m28, m44, m45, m46, m47, m48, m50, m52, m56, m57, m60, m61, m62, m63, m64, m72, m73, m78, m80. Hope that helps many of you in figuring out what you will receive.</li>
    <li> Love these! Super fast shipping and couldnt wait to open them! The designs are all pretty awesome, out of all the plates I think there was 1 that I doubt I will use much, but who knows, maybe if I do any of my little cousins nails! So far I have tried out about 15-20 designs, and all have worked great! No problems at all with them!</li>
    <li> I love these plates!  Many are the same designs as you can get from that expensive \\&quot;K\\&quot; company.  These work just as well for a lot less $$$$ so if you&#x27;re something more of a dimestore diva than a rich fashionista these are soooo for you!!! Go on just get them, it&#x27;s the same price as less than 3 plates from the other guys.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to get this since I didn&#x27;t know what plates were coming in the pack. When they arrived I was so happy with the variety. Saved so much money and got a good collection going.</li>
    <li> Great price, good amount of plates. Takes some getting use to, in order to get to the print outs perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the same exact set as the Mash nail plates that are always sold out. I LOVE the designs and the customer service was awsome, I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am that I found these! I agree with the other posters...please make more designs.</li>
    <li> Ordered these and they came about 4 days later. I have never tried nail art before, I saw the Konad ones, but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay their prices since I didn&#x27;t know if I would like it or not. My daughter and I sat down and used them almost right away. Most of the designs are too large for kid fingers (my daughter bites her nails, so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t hel), but we found a few that worked. I didn&#x27;t use any special polish either, just what I had in my stash. Overall, I&#x27;m very please with the purchase. There are so many designs to choose from, I&#x27;ve already done my nails quite a few times and the design seems to dry very quickly, so I can put my speed dry polish on, and then use a regular polish for the design, and I&#x27;m able to do whatever I want within minutes of finishing my nails. Bonus!</li>
    <li> some of these are good and some i just couldn&#x27;t get to transfer...its like it was all blotchy or something...but all in all i liked it.</li>
    <li> This ended up in the trash.  Total waste of money.  It did not work at all.</li>
    <li> These are great for the price, but will take some trial and error to get used to using them. If you have the time, do it!</li>
    <li> These are good considering the value. Some of the images (like the peacock) don&#x27;t transfer well because it feels like the image wasn&#x27;t carved deep enough or something but most of them work perfectly with regular nail polish. Overall I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> all the plates work amazing although i would recomend using a newer polish on them to get the image to show better :) but other then that a steal!</li>
