<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this mirror!  Great quality.  Easy installation.</li>
    <li> Excellen. Makes looking at the back of myself much easier. Sturdy and beautiful. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and sturdy!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Very well made</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Extends longer than other mirrors so it goes all the way to the end of the bathroom counter. Perfect length. Matches my brushed nickle faucets.</li>
    <li> Easy installation, solid construction even at the maximum extension.</li>
    <li> sturdy and substantial product.</li>
    <li> great price and just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> this two-sided mirror is perfect for my small cottage bathroom.  Looks great and easy to turn out and around.</li>
    <li> Love my mirror! Very easy to install and I can see my eyes!</li>
    <li> Cheap and fairly large! Just needs a little bit of 3-in-1 lube that you can get at any store. I recommend you only grease the middle and bottom joints as you don&#x27;t want this thing swinging all over the place.</li>
    <li> works perfect looks nice</li>
    <li> Awesome quality, works great, extension is fantastic, easy install, great price.  Gives bathroom a spa feel.  NICE PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I have lived without it! Fantastic heavyweight quality. 7x mag is alittle strong for me but very clear.</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Very stable once attached.  I use it to trim my neckline in the back and the wife uses it when curling her hair.  We don&#x27;t use the magnification side as often as we thought we would - it is better for looking at your pores and who wants to see those often???</li>
    <li> Nice quality, it did the job, I&#x27;ll get another one for my downstairs bath.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It was easy to install. The magnifying mirror helps me do my makeup much better in the morning. It looks quality and functions well.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Seems to be exceptionally well made of quality materials. Could not have been easier to install. My wife loves this mirror. My only suggestion would be to secure the mount to a wall stud if at all possible. Frequent lengthening and shortening is likely to eventually dislodge wall anchors.</li>
    <li> Product is well made and good value.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome mirror.  The magnification is just what I need.  Very sturdy and holds up when pulled out from the wall.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> easy 2 hang.. looks good see everything clearing well made, not cheep...</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the money..</li>
    <li> I mounted it on the wall in our bathroom for my wife.  Very well made and easy to mount.  My wife loves this mirror and the flexibility that comes with it  Thank you</li>
    <li> The two sided mirror is of the quality I was hoping for and money well spent. I am happy with the seller, Deco Brothers, and the fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I am getting a older and it is  harder to see to put my mAke up on because my vision  is not as good without  glasses. I brought this l love it. It was easy to install.</li>
    <li> All good!  Love the mirror!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a quality mirror and is good value for your money.</li>
    <li> Larger than I expected</li>
    <li> well worth the money strong and durable lifetime warrenty the only bad thing is there is no light</li>
    <li> Perfect for the bathroom</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Easy to install. Advise using screw in type wall anchors for wallboard.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  It is a quality product....it is easy to install...the price is very low comparable to similar items....and the magnifying side of the mirror will let you see scary things, Ha!</li>
    <li> Just received it, looks well made</li>
    <li> What a great hands free product.  Easy to install and the 7x mirror is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, and was well-packed.  Price much better than expected, and mirror is of good quality.  Have recommended to friends.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for extends pretty far</li>
    <li> Perfect - as described. Well built - nylon bushings operate smoothly. Seems very durable and lots of adjustments possible. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy and great product! Love the size and flexibility of using the mirror to see &amp;#34;behind&amp;#34; me. Also, I love the 7x side for plucking my brows! Lol! Easy to install and fast delivery! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Easy install, really nice quality for the price. All of the joints are tight and move very well. My only complaint is that when the arm is fully extended, the entire arm apparatus is a bit wobbly and tilts down from the weight of the mirror at the end. This doesn&#x27;t detract from the use. I would make the negligible additional effort to collapse the arm after use for storage, just to take pressure off the top joint. This is really great mirror - I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a mirror like this for some time. Most that I have seen were either cheaply made or very expensive. Since I only saw the picture of this mirror, it was hard to tell the quality of it. I got this just 3 days after ordering it. Now that&#x27;s fast!  And let me tell you the quality of this mirror is excellent.  It&#x27;s not cheaply made and it is of substantial quality. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; tall and have trouble putting my make up on, tip-toeing up to the big mirror. So, now I can maneuver it around with the accordion arm and push it back, out of the way, when not in use. It has been a big help for me. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works just as I wanted it to.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It extends out really far. I use it to see the back of my hair when I use my flat iron. It makes the job so much easier, I don&#x27;t have to stop and turn around with a hand held to see what I&#x27;m doing. I just stand with my back to the main mirror and use this one to see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
    <li> Packed securely, all parts included, solidly made, good optics, no complaints.</li>
    <li> easy to hang and good price.</li>
    <li> Nice product, well finished, easy to install.</li>
    <li> It was just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item to replace an IKEA mirror (also very good) of similar design but less magnification.  This mirror is 7X and my IKEA mirror was, I believe, 3X.  This mirror is well made, looks great, and works as described.  My wife is very happy that it helps her see a lot better with its 7X magnification.  Happily, the mirror&#x27;s installation holes lined up with the holes for the IKEA mirror that I replaced, so all is good.  The mirror is also bigger than the IKEA mirror, which is also a plus.  The only reason that I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the weight.  This mirror is a lot heftier than the mirror I replaced, so I am hoping that the old anchors (which were not small anchors) will hold this for the long term.  And, just to be clear, this mirror is not too heavy, it is just heavier than the previous mirror due to its larger size and solid construction.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, easy to install</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror and fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> This is my second DecoBros mirror. Very easy to install and good quality.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fits snuggly to the wall.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  My friend bought one similar to this for $60, and hers only has two arms, not the accordion-like extension this has.  It is very compact when fully closed and easy to get out-of-the-way.  My husband mounted it behind the bathroom door and it&#x27;s very easy to see from the vanity mirror.  Also easy to just turn and use it on the magnification side when applying eye makeup.  Since the mirror swivels, I can get it at an angle where it catches the light well.</li>
    <li> love it ~~very sturdy</li>
    <li> This product seems to be well made. I really like the 7x magnification. It works well to see the back of my hair. Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I have a 1920s vanity in my Vanity Room but with my prescription, it&#x27;s hard to do my makeup without my glasses on. there are two versions of this mirror, I got the one with the XXXX type arm. Its looks extremely classy. The arm has enough tension to pull in and out easily but stay exactly how you put it. It arrived well packed and in perfect condition. The magnification side is NOT fun house mirror like some people said. It works well to pluck eyebrow hairs and whatnot. I don&#x27;t use it often as the normal side is usually more than enough for me but it&#x27;s nice to have the option. After seeing mine, my mom wants one. lol</li>
    <li> Awesome. What took me so long to get it? Now I can apply my makeup without any problem or worrying ablut anything. It looks great on the wall too. It doesn&#x27;t take hardly any space. Love it</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality, heavy duty mirror.  The packaging was among the best I&#x27;ve ever seen. I bought it to replace another wall mirror that had only 4x magnification.  As my eyes age, I need to be able to see clearly as I apply makeup.  This mirror enables me to see in microscopic detail (all right, it&#x27;s a little scary to see that much detail), but I have only praise for the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect.  As described.  Delivered on time.  Could not have been a better experience.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Item as described, sturdy so far, and great for viewing up close on the magnified side.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Installation was very easy.  Very pleased with this mirror.</li>
    <li> My son-in-law had to install it for me (don&#x27;t have a drill), but I use it every day and love it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this was only $20. This mirror is very sturdy and looks great.  Just a warning, though. With 7x magnification you can see things you really don&#x27;t want to!  Every pore, every line!</li>
    <li> Very well built and heavy duty.  Installation was a breeze.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install and a perfect accessory in my master bathroom!</li>
    <li> My purchase arrived in a timely manner and in good order.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Hair styling and trims are easier - now that I can see the back of my head, with both hands free&lt;br /&gt;to use hair accessory equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was expecting to receive a light-weight mirror (like one I had  before).  This one is very substantial and affixes firmly to the wall.  The first time I looked at the magnifying side of the mirror, I realized that the other &amp;#34;magnifying&amp;#34; mirror I had been using was virtually useless.  This mirror is great for plucking eyebrows and applying eye makeup.  I&#x27;m 68 and really needed a mirror like this one.</li>
    <li> I love this 2-sided wall mirror. It works well for me in the position I use it for.</li>
    <li> Great quality. It is quite heavy so we put a toggle bolt thru the center hole.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Excellent product-truly value for money!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s sturdy, but easy to pull out and use.  Fits nicely against the wall when not in use.  The last makeup mirror that I bought was far inferior to this one, and I&#x27;m glad that it broke so that I could buy this one!  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a magnifying mirror.  I can tell it&#x27;s going to last for years and years.</li>
    <li> Much larger and heavier than I expected, but still quite satisfactory.</li>
    <li> What a well-made, high-quality, and beautiful wall mount mirror.  It is exactly what we were searching for.  Can&#x27;t say enough about the exquisite quality and craftsmanship of this product.  A great value!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very well made and finished.  Easy to mount and use.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT seller, very fast shipping!!! Exactly what I wanted... Thanks! A+</li>
    <li> The hardware itself appears to be very sturdy, though it seems to be stainless steel and not nickel.  The 7X magnification is not very useful as it makes everything appear somewhat distorted.</li>
    <li> Cool, just what I needed. Developed shoulder/neck tingling from bending too far toward the bathroom mirror while shaving. Ordered this, two day prime shipping, Looks rather like something grandpa would have used, kinda deco-ish brushed nickel finish. Very stout and solid feeling, I located a stud and anchored the mounting plate with three inch-long screws. Seems too heavy to depend on drywall anchors, maybe that&#x27;s just me. Great accessory!</li>
    <li> Looks and works great as long as you make sure you anchor it securely to the wall. I feel you need to anchor it to a stud. I&#x27;m pretty sure it will pull out of wallboard quickly.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Seems to be heavy duty,and It is some what heavy, so I would suggest you only attach it to a stud. Worth the money. Well 7 months later it&#x27;s still great, and I have not had any rust, or other issues.</li>
    <li> I love these mirrors... they are perfect for cutting my own hair... I purchased 2 mirrors to put on the wall in the bathroom directly in front of the mirror over the sink..  they are a nice size... I am very pleased with them.. they work great...</li>
    <li> Was easy to mount, the finish is beautiful and the mirrors are both very clear &amp; true to the magnification.  I&#x27;m delighted. Thanks for a quality product!!</li>
