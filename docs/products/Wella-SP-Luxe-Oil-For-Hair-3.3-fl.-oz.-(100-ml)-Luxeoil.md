    <li> I have gray hair and read about this on going gray looking great.  It makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Luxurious oil that smells good and makes hair smooth, soft and gives some shine.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair shiny, healthy and beautiful. I got it to protect my keratin treatment. Works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy</li>
    <li> Love this product! Makes my hair smell amazing and feels and looks great!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product in many ways, but there is an important caveat (see below). The oil feels and smells (slightly so) wonderful. It is slighy viscous and does a great job at preventing frizz and keeping hair slightly wet-looking, silky,  and orderly, without stickiness. It is hard to evaluate whether it actually protects hair as the marketers claim. The caveat and my only problem with thr oil is that I am quite certain a person can accomplish the same effect with much cheaper alternatives. Chemically speaking, oils are similar - for practical purposes like use in hair they differ mosyly in their viscosity and melting poits. So why pay so much for supposedly &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; oil, when I can buy half a liter of food grade vegetable oil and have the same effect? I have been using food grade almond oil, and my hair stylist thought I had bought an expensive oil like LyxOil. In my opinion, LuxOil is a quality product but not worth the money - you get accomplish the same effect with much cheaper (and more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;) alternatives.</li>
    <li> This oil is magic. I have tried so many and this is the best by far. It instantly makes hair smoother, glossier, softer. Hair feels like it&#x27;s just been cut. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. The smell is delicious! It&#x27;s worth paying the money for this product. You won&#x27;t look at other hair oils again, trust me.</li>
    <li> Best oil !!! Hands down!!</li>
    <li> I like not love this product, it&#x27;s nice and light but I really prefer more of an Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Leaves your hair manageable and looking healthy!</li>
    <li> Okay oil.. for the price though better products out there</li>
    <li> The process was very smooth, I ordered it and it was shipped pretty much straight away.  Received in the correct time frame and I love the product.  I have long thick hair and it is such an amazing product, hair really soft, manageable and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most certainly buy the rest of the wella range from this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J</li>
    <li> Love this oil, leaves  my hair looking and smelling awesome</li>
    <li> Great product love it</li>
    <li> Super love this product!! i use it all the time, wet or dry hair. and it smells good!! I have color treated hair and it works wonders on it! I also like how it&#x27;s not greasy.. It&#x27;s fairly priced i think, for the oils that you get for your hair, and yes i will buy it againwhen i&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. Smells great, not greasy, aids in styling.</li>
    <li> I use this oil all the time. The hard water really does a number on my hair and I really couldn&#x27;t manage many hair without the Luxe.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil. Shipping was fantastic!</li>
    <li> I first used this product when I went back home to the U.K from the USA and had a haircut.  I have thick and wavy hair and always need help keeping it soft as I style it with a hairdryer.  This product goes on your hair wet or dry - I use it after showering and use about 7-8 pumps and apply all over.  It does not make my hair greasy, makes it easier to style and keeps it soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it here on Amazon once I had ran out, which was nearly 4 months after I originally bought it - I do have short hair, but I use a lot due to the amount of hair I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great all rounder and replaces so many of the gimmicky hair products!  When I use this I rarely have use any other products on my hair pre and post styling. I do sometimes apply Moroccan oil after, depending on how sleek I want my hair to look, but that is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it!  Great postage times too!  Very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I loved this oil since first time I used. It really makes my hair smooth, soft and shiny. I certainly recommend this purchase!</li>
    <li> I ordered it the second time for myself and once as a gift for my friend. Super product, makes your hair not that dry on the ends, very good for long chemically colored hair. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Smells great, and seems to get the job done</li>
    <li> Delivery .. is not perfect .. but I received it within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But thanks to get this with this good price.</li>
    <li> The best hair oil ever!</li>
    <li> I really like it and make my hair smooth! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> This Oil is just awesome. I bought one for me. Now I bought one for my girlfriend. The smell is just great and the quality is just awesome. great product by Wella.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I tend to have really frizzy and dry hair. I tried another type of hair oil but that just made my hair really oily/greasy. This product, on the other hand really helps my hair. Its less frizzy and it feels healthier. And its not greasy at all - it doesnt feel like I have any product in it at all, actually. You also dont have to use that much of it, so the bottle lasts for a good periode of time. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> From the great reviews, I had to try this product, and it is great, smells wonderful HOWEVER I just discovered Wella was bought out by Proctor and Gamble.  That means they do test on animals, and that makes me very unhappy that I am contributing to animal torture just for a hair product.</li>
    <li> Does the job well. I have owned several oils like these, I like moroccan oil and wella sp oil. After shower, if your hair gets all frizzy, apply this gently, take the amount necessary till there is no more frizz in the hair. Don&#x27;t apply it on the scalp, only on hair strands. After application, you can blow dry your hair or you can flat iron them. Looks great!</li>
    <li> Let me say that I am not a huge fan of hair oils but this stuff is AMAZING!!!! It makes my hair shiny and super soft. If you ever had a keratin treatment you know how great the hair feels afterwards. This is exactly what I am getting every time I apply this product. It smells nice too!!</li>
    <li> RE POSTING ORDERED JULY 1ST EXCEPTED SHIP DATE AUG 11TH DO NOT ORDER</li>
    <li> not sure if I am using this product correctly.  I think I put to much on my hair.  I will keep using it until it is finished.</li>
    <li> Awesome Softness! Smells so good!</li>
