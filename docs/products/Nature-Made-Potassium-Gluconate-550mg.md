<li> Many people, especially diabetics, take diuretics such as lasix which can lower their potassium to dangerous levels.  </li>
<li> The surface of the tablet is not slick like most tablets and is impossible for me to swallow without choking or having it get stuck part way down.</li>
<li> This brand has the same 3% of RDA of potassium as any of the other over the counter potassium supplement.  </li>
<li> I take one daily, along with the rest of my vitamins and minerals, before I start my work shift, no cramps or any other annoyance throughout the day, but the sense of wellness.</li>
<li> I think the formula could be stronger, I decided to take it because I have been low carbin and have been getting leg cramps, taking it for around 3 weeks now and noticed very little improvement..</li>
<li> I find it hard to believe that they regulate over the counter items to containing only 3%.  </li>
<li> Since taking this product, I&#x27;ve had them maybe once a month and way less severe.</li>
<li> I sadly was one of the ignorant and bought this item at CVS.</li>
<li> Getting your potassium raised by intravenous injection is both painful and dangerous.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> i take one pill a day. i guess it is working. no blood work to be done to  learn if it is adding needed potassium.</li>
    <li> nature made has a lot of fillers</li>
    <li> No chalky aftertaste, reasonable price, performs well for me.</li>
    <li> Great product and I received it sealed.</li>
    <li> Would recommenced to friends.</li>
    <li> This helped.  I was getting them almost nightly.  Since taking this product, I&#x27;ve had them maybe once a month and way less severe.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and use everyday good product.</li>
    <li> This is a classic example of a supplement that a company pays 25 cents to make and sells for 40 times that! It is very misleading when it says 550mg on the front of the bottle. If you do research you will see that for each 6 mg of gluconate there is only 1 gram of potassium. Therefore, there is only 90 mg of potassium per pill. That is a very low amount compared to the daily value you need. Its like eating half of a large banana! Classic case of abuse of peoples ignorance. I sadly was one of the ignorant and bought this item at CVS. Get educated! Don&#x27;t buy this item! You should find a pill that has closer to 400-500 mgs.</li>
    <li> The label is misleading.  This brand has the same 3% of RDA of potassium as any of the other over the counter potassium supplement.  The US RDA is 3000 mg/day.  I find it hard to believe that they regulate over the counter items to containing only 3%.  You can get more potassium from a banana, why bother with a supplement?  As far as this product is concerned I do not appreciate the prominent label of 550 mg on the front.  This is misleading AT BEST.  The 550 mg refers to the combined weight including the Gluconate.  Why should we care what the gluconate weighs?  Isn&#x27;t the purpose of purchasing this product the potassium?  Generously 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I need extra potassium, since I am allergic to so many potassium rich foods, this product works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love Nature Made vitamins but their potassium is great</li>
    <li> made well,works great,I CAN SEE</li>
    <li> I can never find these at the store anymore. The price is right as well for such a large quantity.</li>
    <li> I bought these to add to magnesium and calcium supplements to help with night leg cramps.  The surface of the tablet is not slick like most tablets and is impossible for me to swallow without choking or having it get stuck part way down.</li>
    <li> -Quality was good and commensurate with price.  Item was delivered within estimate.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, does exactly what I want and delivered on time.  Nice transaction</li>
    <li> Dissolves well in your system.  Great pricing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> How can a person &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; a potassium supplement, but I give it a 5 for quality, price and doing a nice job of preventing night-time leg cramps, at least for me.</li>
    <li> great price fast delivery</li>
    <li> I think the formula could be stronger, I decided to take it because I have been low carbin and have been getting leg cramps, taking it for around 3 weeks now and noticed very little improvement..</li>
    <li> When cramps in my legs and feet start bothering me, I remember I need to order potassium, even when I eat a banana a day. I take one daily, along with the rest of my vitamins and minerals, before I start my work shift, no cramps or any other annoyance throughout the day, but the sense of wellness. Nature Made is a great brand for most of my vitamin/mineral supplements.</li>
    <li> Nature Made is a brand I trust.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> Great for helping with muscle cramp and potassium replacement. Helped me a lot!</li>
    <li> Many people, especially diabetics, take diuretics such as lasix which can lower their potassium to dangerous levels.  Getting your potassium raised by intravenous injection is both painful and dangerous.  I do not know enough about medicines to know why the diuretics sellers don&#x27;t put potassium into their products, but I personally believe any doctor should caution their patients when giving them their diuretic prescription about the need for potassium supplements.</li>
    <li> The best  thing if you hate bananas or can not have sugar and taking water pill.  This product is high potency and safe for even most sensitive people.</li>
    <li> Excellent I think it will work Well  So far It Working Very good!!!!!!</li>
    <li> ewe vitamins... they are good</li>
    <li> help with muscle cramps</li>
    <li> good product, but not as cheap as in the stores</li>
    <li> Helps maintain my potassiu levels.</li>
    <li> use them daily for cramps in legs and share with my friend and he takes them every day also</li>
