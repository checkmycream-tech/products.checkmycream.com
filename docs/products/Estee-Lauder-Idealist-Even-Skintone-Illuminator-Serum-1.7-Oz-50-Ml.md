<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this serum for over a year and am happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I think you will like it.</li>
    <li> A great serum for all ages &amp; lightens brown spots &amp; wrinkles. Nice treat for your face &amp; neck plus other areas.</li>
    <li> I received this as one of those tiny sample cards in the mail and I&#x27;ve got to tell you, this stuff is amazing.  I&#x27;m insanely pale and just getting out of a 10 minute shower makes my face red and splotchy.  I have a few spots on my cheeks that are a different shade of pale.  I applied this cream all over my face 3 times and after the third application, I could already tell that my skin was brighter and much more clearer.  Most of those red spots on my cheeks are gone.  If nothing else works for you then this probably will. It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell but for the price, it is kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> This product is very expensive, and very misleading.  It has a greasy feeling after you put it on.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I don&#x27;t notice a difference at all yet.  Only that my glasses constantly are falling off my nose because my skin is so greasy.  Maybe its just my skin condition but this is way too oily and greasy for me.  If you already have oily skin DO NOT buy this product.  You can buy much cheaper, just as efficient, products from walmart or target.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  Pricey but so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I started using it I immediately noticed a difference.  My skin is so soft and young looking.&lt;br /&gt;What a bargain to get that for this price.</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator Serum 1.7 Oz / 50 Ml No Box NEW Product 2011   I purchased this about 3 weeks ago and I didnt&#x27; have any issues at all.  I have almost perfect skin with some pores on my nose and that&#x27;s about it.  So I figured it woulnd&#x27;t hurt to try this Illuminator Serum as long it&#x27;s not oily i won&#x27;t break out and from what the lady behind the counter told me I will glow.  So I bought it, expensive by the way...  I tried it literally 5 to 6 times and I&#x27;ve noticing dark pathes on my side of my cheeks.  I&#x27;ve stopped it using it now for 4 days now and it&#x27;s still there!!!  I don&#x27;t go into the sun, tan or anything like that.  I&#x27;m an Asian and I avoid the sun like a plague.  Now I don&#x27;t know what to do, the patch is dark and ugly.  I will NOT recommend this to anyone especially to any Asian Skins. BAD BAD BAD.  I am hoping it will lighten due time.  I only used it 5 to 6 times and it effected my skin this much, my GOD what kind of chemicals did they put in this thing?!! I would give it NO star if i can.  STAY AWAY!</li>
    <li> I recommend this to my friends, love this product.</li>
    <li> so far, my skin is soooo soft, and its texture and color is more even.  I hate to give a review so early, but I&#x27;m very excited how smooth and even my skin looks, and even thought it doesn&#x27;t indicate that it&#x27;s a pore minimizer, my pores appear smaller.  My makeup goes on much more evenly, and my skin feels soft.    However, I don&#x27;t put it directly on my skin.  I use my night time moisturizer first - Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Night Time Refining Cream Moisture Complex right after I wash my face.  I use very little because my face is still moist, and the cream spreads very evenly with a thin layer.  I then use no more than a single drop of the Estee Lauder Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator Serum.  My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years!</li>
    <li> I bought this product from fragrance_hut_usa, and they sent me an unboxed bottle without   a pump for the 1.7oz.  I posted negative feedback, and they told me to remove it and   they would send me a complimentary bottle...but haven&#x27;t heard back from them.  Since I&#x27;m   not sure what they actually put in the bottle, which they claim has not been tampered with,   I gave my purchase to a friend to try.  Still optimistic that the product itself is great,   after reading all your reviews...but will probably not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and it was good</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with adult acne, and I had such confidence that this product would help me that I got the largest size. Three weeks later, my face is all \\&quot;burned\\&quot; from the fruit acids they use to lighten the dark spots. This product is basically just a glorified face peel mixed into a tinted, pearlized fluid. You HAVE to apply an SPF-protected moisturizer after application as it can dry up your skin pretty quickly. I think I&#x27;m going to have to stop using this product. Will probably not buy another Estee Lauder product again.</li>
    <li> The first time I applied this product it went on like silk and I really liked the smell. After one day my skin became irritated an small lines seemed exagerated. Thinking this was perhaps just a cooincidence I applied it a second day. My sking became very red and began breaking out in acne and the lines were even worse. I stopped using the product immediately but the rash and acne lasted for months. Generally speaking, my skin is only mildly sensitive but these negative reactions were off the charts. Tread lightly if you think you want to try this product.</li>
    <li> Love this serum.  It feels good and good for older women.  Been on Este Lauder products for years.  Use to use Clinque.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to purchase such a pricey product but the clerk at my local Belk&#x27;s convinced me to give it a try.  I am AA with extremely oily, acne ridden skin and did not think this would work for me.      One of the first issues I had with Idealist is that the package was not sealed.  The clerk told me this was a Ester Lauder product and most are sold behind the counter so they are not sealed.  Did not like that answer but started using Idealist and within two weeks the right side of my face was spotless and glowing.  The left side had larger acne spots and is taking longer but the improvement on both sides are more than I hoped for. The dark marks on the left side are barely visible now and expect them to be gone in another two weeks.  My skin has never been this beautiful and all I do is use Idealist two times a day - morning and night.      Couple of reasons I&#x27;m not giving this five stars:  1) It did break my chin area out when I first started using it but then it stopped within a week. I had to use less around my chin area until it got used to the formula then all was good.     2) Does not address wrinkels or pores.  I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles due to my oily skin but just a tad around my eyes.  Want to start being proactive with wrinkle reducer now and keep them away as long a possible. Saw a commercial for Lancome Visionnaire Advanced Skintone Corrector and it addresses everything Idealist does plus wrinkles and pores.  Visionairre is just as pricey but may give it a try after I finish Idealist.     Even though Idealist is very pricey it delivered as promised.  I touch my soft smooth skin regularly because I can&#x27;t believe its finally smooth and luxurious looking.  For a lifelong acne prone, spotted face girl I am now really really in love with my skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with Estee Lauder products. They are entirely worth it, however, please please do not buy from greedy sellers on Amazon.com - It is $58.00 at the official Estee Lauder website. Please do NOT pay more than $58 for this item. I don&#x27;t know why sellers are charging $68-$100 for the same 1oz bottle you can buy from the REAL manufacturer of this product. BUYER BEWARE of this!!   Anyway, the product itself is great. It smells wonderful and makes your skin super supple and soft. In the sunlight, it looks a little like you have sparkles on your face. The product is incredible though. I have acne scars that are slowly disappearing with daily use. It&#x27;s great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Removes dark spots and imperfections.</li>
    <li> My pores disappear with this stuff!  It gives my 48-yr-old skin a nice glow.  Makeup goes on smoothly and looks fresher all day.  I like this product ... a lot.  Grab a sample from the cosmetics counter and try it.  I was sold from the first application.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I have sun spots/age spots/liver spots on my face from when I used to neglect sunscreen and I&#x27;ve been wanting to get rid of them. I have pretty noticeable ones around the outer corners of my face on both sides. I was somewhat skeptical, and because this product was pricey I took before and after pictures for comparison and was extremely surprised by the outcome. My large and very visible spots were much lighter in color and some had altogether disappeared! (It&#x27;s important to note that at the beginning, you will have to use it morning and night to see results.) However, after a while I started using this product on a less regular basis and the spots came back a little. So I&#x27;m back to using it everyday...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a skin illuminator, I do like this for that. It evens out my skin on a superficial and temporary basis very well. Texture-wise, this feels like a primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful!</li>
    <li> Good and soothing. Have not seen results promised to fade uneven skin tone. Used for years because it is a good lightweight, oil free moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. I am just receive this item. It doesn&#x27;t look like one in store. It is look so cheap and fake. I will reture it back tomorrow.</li>
    <li> love this product.  Have been using it for years as the under moisturizer for my face.</li>
    <li> It evens out skin tone after 2 months of daily use, will continue to use this product for best results</li>
    <li> I love this product because its light weight, improves my skins overall appearance, and is not heavy or sticky when applied with my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. If you&#x27;re looking for the product to improve your skin I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is a very silky facial cream that is great to wear under makeup.</li>
    <li> leave your skin great but</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My husband wears it too!  It gives our skin this nice luminous</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try to help fade acne scarring from my pregnancy. I was blessed with great skin my entire life until the birth of my son. Since then, I have dealt with Adult Acne and the resulting scars. Not only did this product not help, it made me break out all over my cheeks and chin. I stopped using it and I am starting to clear up now. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have oily skin or deal with breakouts. Although it feels silky and looks luminous, it can really aggravate certain skin types.</li>
    <li> My wife really loves it. Thanks~</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this!! I have to say this is one of the best products I have used on my face in years! I have some blotchy spots on my face and after using this they are diminishing! For he price it is well worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> She loves this stuff so much, she constantly tells me when to order more! and i do feel and see a difference in her skin! and IM A GUY!</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day for about a month... I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the evenness of my skintone... I am pale with some redness in my face. It does make my skin really smooth, and functions as a nice primer for blush and highlighter pen (I don&#x27;t wear foundation.) I will buy it again for those properties, but I haven&#x27;t seen the effect that it promises in the ads.</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin care product ! Hides all flaws on my skin and makes skin feel smooth! Love it! Will buy again !</li>
    <li> Perfect match! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I also received this full sized product to sample.  I am multi-racial with very pale skin that scars and bruises easily.  I battle scars from monthly breakouts, red patches on my cheeks and darkness under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using the product in the a.m. and p.m. since June 5 and have noticed a great improvement in my skin tone.  Acne scars which normally last months have lightened up.  Even my tiny \\&quot;tweezer scars\\&quot; have lightened up a great deal.      Don&#x27;t be fooled by the 1.7oz size, a little goes a long way.  I believe this bottle will last me about a year if not longer.     I have very dry, sensitive skin so I always hesitate to try new products.  I&#x27;m very happy that I was given the opportunity to try this product, and for FREE!  I will purchase it next time.</li>
    <li> I was so so happy to find good price for Estée Lauder products. I love the products, but can&#x27;t afford the price. I hope perfume world wide will continue with these bargains. It was exact the same (but bigger and cheaper) product I bought Macy&#x27;s.  A little goes a long way! Thank you doe the awesome deal and quilitu product.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin like snow white. It is very helpful to improve skin condition and make it very smoothe.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, though pricey product.  Use it sparingly to even out your skintone and to help moisturize your skin.  It helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles and give your skin a lovely glow.  I usually use on my cheekbones, after my make up is applied.</li>
    <li> Great product that I can order online and cost less than in store. Do not have to drive to the local department store.Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful on my skin....gives me a nice glow and an even skin tone.  I use it everyday and it feels nice on my face...goes on nicely too.  I&#x27;m 68 so I need all the help I can get......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for less than a week and I already notice an improvement in my skin texture and tone.  It seems that this product is penetrating the skin and lifting the dead skin cells so that new and less damaged skin appears.  Which is why the blemishes get lighter and lighter.  Again, I&#x27;ve only used this product for less that 7 full days.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in 2 weeks.  I am very excited and hopeful.  I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for softer and more radiant and blemish free skin.</li>
    <li> this skin ton is very good</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described,</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited to purchase this product when I found out about it. I went to my local Belk&#x27;s and spoke to a consultant, to make sure I understood how to use it, apply correctly, ect, so I could get the best results possible. So as I know not to expect the results too soon, I used it every moring and evening for 2 months, and was SO upset to not notice any changes. While my skin felt soft, and the serum was not greasy, the amount of money I spent on this product was not worth it. So I continued to use it til it was empty, I was saddened by the results I did not see.</li>
    <li> Gosh this serum is amazing. I have a red complex and this soothes out my tone to a nice healthy glow while making my skin feel soft. Im prone to breakouts but this is oil free and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. LOVE LOVE LOVE. perfect for a nice summer glow for when you don&#x27;t feel like putting on makeup! Takes about a week to show changes in skin. This way I only apply small amount of chanel liquid for under eye and the rest of my skin looks great after using this product.</li>
    <li> This has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product.  It always brightens my complexion and makes me look wide awake and rested.</li>
    <li> this product made my dark spots got darker. It is really bad product. In the moment I stoped using theproduct, my skin got clear.</li>
    <li> I used this serum for awhile and is amazing it def even up the skin complex in maybe two weeks</li>
    <li> I have used this serum for a year and am very happy with how my dark spots on my face have lightened</li>
    <li> I was originally very happy with this product as it made my skin supple smooth.  I also was willing to pay the big bucks for a trusted brand, due to major problems in the past with unheard of brands.  But after faithfully using this product for one year twice a day, I STILL have the same dark spots as a year ago (some smaller ones were improved, but that could also be because it&#x27;s been a year!).  I think that&#x27;s the most patient I&#x27;ve ever been with a skin product. Sure my skin is soft, but for its price and sticky residue feel... I&#x27;m happy to move on and try another.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with an amazing price -this was exactly what I wanted and for the price I wanted to pay - win win all around</li>
    <li> I am a light-skinned African American female and this honestly didn&#x27;t do anything for my post inflammatory hyperpigmentation from acne.  I used the product as directed but it didn&#x27;t even out my discoloration at all.  Perhaps I didn&#x27;t use the product long enough to see results, but in my opinion, if you can&#x27;t see a difference after using a full bottle of the product (especially a product this expensive), then it&#x27;s not worth it.  I&#x27;m giving it two stars though because it smells nice, has a good consistency, and did not break me out.</li>
    <li> Used the Even Skintone product for a couple of months, then noticed light blotches... a quarter-sized one on my chin, and smaller light patches around my lips.  Also, both cheeks.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.  I guess it&#x27;s just not right for my African-American, medium-brown skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Idealist for years and I will continue using it.  It helps my moisturizer and foundation glide on.  I love how it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three years now and it is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;.  It leaves my skin feeling beautiful and my complexion flawless...I love it!</li>
    <li> An Amazing cream that makes your complexion look completely harmonious, while regulating your different skin tones into one, Very glad to have purchased this item</li>
    <li> Best. Stuff. Ever. Too bad Lauder is phasing it out. I need to hoard it.</li>
    <li> This serum is the worst in my opinion. First of all i use the Clarisonic Mia to clean my face, then apply Premier Vitamin C &amp; E Serum (awesome stuff) then i apply this estee Lauder serum which does leave blotches on my face also. It doesn&#x27;t even out my skin tone &amp; under my eyes seem darker like a raccoon. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s &amp; caucasian. Personally i wouldn&#x27;t buy this stuff if it was $20. DO NOT waster your money on this product, please find something better. Estee Lauder does have good products but NOT this one. The CP+R is awesome. Goodluck girls!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks or so.  I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference but I&#x27;m still using it and have to give it more time.  I&#x27;m not expecting a miracle but I think overall it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> This product without a  package and seal, just a bottle of serum.&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive skin, this product I used don&#x27;t has any discomfort. It makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> This is one of my most favorite products! Absolutely love.</li>
    <li> Saw no difference in skin tone or pores. Has a lot of shiny stuff(mica?) in it. Causes skin to break out some (this was the only product I use then) Their advanced night repair serum is better.</li>
    <li> Useless. It doesn&#x27;t change the texture of your skin if it has any effect, it&#x27;s because the fine particle in the serum making your skin look better</li>
