<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin this product is a must. The scent is subtle and it moisturizes without a trace of greasiness. A small dime size drop does the trick so the bottle will last a long time. Well worth the $25+ cost.</li>
    <li> Fantastic aftershave. I&#x27;ve used twice since getting it this week,  and I can say that whatever irritation I may have due the shave,  this skin food soothes and hydrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that the face is not left oily or creamy. It&#x27;s absorbed immediately by the skin,  and you can almost feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few different balms aftershave,  including the big box store ones,  and I can&#x27;t even compare to this... That&#x27;s how good this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricy for sure,  but very much worth every penny. The scent is subtle,  not over powering,  ND certainly not long lasting. My TOBS sandalwood comes through more than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Was skeptical about this at first.  But use so little that I will still be applying it long after I forgot how much it cost.  About a large rain-drop will be plenty and it sooths the face without the sting.  Seems to restore the skin.  Use with either DE or cartridge shaving.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent after shaving it conditions and moisturizes your skin. I recommend it and will buy it again. You should not worry about the price a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Ok I love the smell of lime but who doesn&#x27;t ? When I started getting into old school double edge razor blade shaving and banished Gillette from my life forever (YEA!), I saw that this Trumper&#x27;s \\&quot;skin food\\&quot; kept coming up again and again in the recommendations within the shaving forums. I knew there had to be something to this product but the price made me wary. When I saw how much this bottle cost I really did laugh out loud- hey I&#x27;m cheap and Target sells post shave balms for $5 why do I need this foo-foo ripoff stuff ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I put my skepticism aside and got this as a Christmas present to myself and I&#x27;m damn glad I did. This stuff smells incredible. In fact my wife probably loves it more than me if that&#x27;s possible. Improves my shaving and my sex life ? Incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how does it work for it&#x27;s intended purpose ? Well, the stuff melds into your face after you put it on and really does make skin feel great after shaving. It has an interesting \\&quot;thick\\&quot; consistency; meaning its thicker than liquid and is not quite a gel- just right to keep it in the intended spot on your palm when you squeeze a bit onto your hand. There is no burn (very little alcohol if any in this product)and only a 30 second wet look as the stuff gets absorbed into your skin. A little dab will do you! If your face still has that \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look after a minute or two you&#x27;re using too much and need an intervention! Many guys in the shaving forums (Badger &amp; Blade etc.) say that one bottle of this stuff will last over a year. If you are judicious and use a tiny nickel size dab this stuff works incredibly well, smells fantastic, and you&#x27;ll be looking forward to using this after your shave! This skeptic is beginning to think this was a great investment. I hope you will as well. Best!</li>
    <li> Love the smell. That&#x27;s what saves this stuff I think. I don&#x27;t know how great it works. Never had a problem with it though. Not very moisturizing if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.  Somewhat thin. But, it is what its supposed to be.</li>
    <li> It helps but the smell does not last long.  Maybe that will be a positive for you, I hope so.  Then it would be 5 stars in your eyes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful.  Does it cost too much for such a small bottle?  Heck yes.  Does it soothe the razor burn in a delightful way? Heck yes.  As a beginner to wet shaving, this stuff has been awesome for my face and neck.  Like others, I love the smell and wish it would linger longer.  And while too spendy, a little goes a long way.  The bottle should last me nearly six months.  With all the money I am saving on blades, I will be able to treat myself to this splurge.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice clean fresh scent feels good after shaving.</li>
    <li> It smells great, goes on easy and soothes my head and face after shaving, what more can I ask for? Well, it&#x27;s also less expensive than the alcohol-based aftershaves found in most stores because you use so little of it. Get some. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Contains a small amount of alcohol, so it feels.somewhat drying to the skin.  Otherwise, it meets the high expectations that its storied reputation engenders. Nice citrus smell without being overbearing, seems to have a fair amount of glycerin that smooths, soothes, and seals the skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> This is one of my best discoveries in a long time.  If you want your skin to feel refreshed and not irritated after shaving use this product!  the scent doesn&#x27;t last long but your skin will feel great all day.</li>
    <li> I have heard other guys talking about the advantages of wet shaving...so i decided to start looking into it bit by bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As i have already purchased a few aftershaves...heres my review of Geo F. Trumper Limes Skin Food. (Which is considerably cheaper here than other sites)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first get it...1st thing that runs in your mind is...\\&quot;hmm this is a small bottle\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;(But you realize when you use it...all you need is a dab on your fingertip (two drops worth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you wipe it on your face after a dab of it...you&#x27;ll feel how thick it feels. It leaves a slight wet look as if you put moisturizer on your face.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is incredible (True Limes!) ...and it lingers on your face for a bit. (My wife&#x27;s favorite A/S so far)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my time using it, you&#x27;ll notice a few things&lt;br /&gt;1- Your face will feel smoother after using it...truly a moisturizing feeling&lt;br /&gt;2- A little bit will make this small bottle last you a LONG time...(my friend bought it in the summer and isn&#x27;t 1/2 way through)&lt;br /&gt;3- The smell is incredible...&lt;br /&gt;4-It helps calm razor burns....truly skin food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you still on the fence  try the Skin Food sampler pack from maggards (http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/geo-f-trumper-skin-food-samples/ )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t complain about using this product as Im totally satisfied with this purchase plus price here ($17.25) is quite a bargain...if i didn&#x27;t already have a bottle id buy another.</li>
    <li> Great Quality and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> TRYED IT LOVED IT BUT TO COSTLY FOR ME. IT LASTS A LONG TIME CAUSE A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY..IF I WAS NOT ON FIXED INCOME I WOULD BY AGAIN BUT I HAVE OTHERS I THINK ARE JUST AS GOOD FOR LESS MONEY. UNTILL IT RUNS OUT ITS HIGH ON MY ROTATION LIST. MAYBE I WILL GET LUCKY AND A LOVED ONE WILL GIVE IT TO ME AS A GIFT</li>
    <li> Lots of people seem to like Trumpers, but it just doesn&#x27;t do well for me. The scent smells like lime jolly ranchers, and it does nothing for my razorburn. I much prefer an alcohol based splash.</li>
    <li> I think this Skin Food is a great product. The smell is great, but it is not too strong. I have been using this for about a week and can already tell that my skin is healthier and looks much better!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the small bottle and high price fool you.  This product will last you a LONG time and is actually a very good value.  It&#x27;s hands-down the best pre and post-shave product that I&#x27;ve used.  I use a pea-sized dab on my face before my shave and then after, and my skin has never felt better.  All serious shavers should have this in their arsenal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this whole style of shaving. As most men from my generation I grew up using the Gilette cartridge products along with the standard aftershave products they offer. Recently (just turned 35) I decided to treat myself and try something new. In doing so I read many recommendations for this product as an aftershave...all I can say is that I wish I had done this sooner. You need VERY little of this stuff (less than a dime size) to cover your after shave needs and it smells and feel amazing. Clean, quickly absorbing, and highly moisturizing. I&#x27;m more than pleased with this product and plan to try others within this line. The other benefit is that this bottle will last quite a long time (I&#x27;ve been using it for well over a month now and have barely started to break into the bottle). I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with this product. I recommend it highly to anyone that has not tried it thus far.</li>
    <li> The cost is high, but the quality is outstanding. It takes very little to cover freshly shaved areas so it lasts a long time. The aroma is subtle and it feels excellent. My wife loves how it smooths my skin. I like the refreshing feel and the protection from foreign debris prevents breakouts and calms slight razor burn.</li>
    <li> ever since i started using this, i no longer get razor bumps or skin irritation.</li>
    <li> The bottle itself is MUCH smaller than I expected. About the size of a bottle of pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aftershave itself works well and smells nice. Could be a little more aromatic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but there is better for the same or less money. This has a very nice, light key lime scent. Beyond that however, I really didn&#x27;t feel it was anything extraordinary as a post-shave balm. The scent dissipates quickly ( which maybe you want), and it also includes alcohol as an ingredient which can dry out  the skin over time. I love many of George Trumper shaving creams ( especially fond of coconut and lime), but felt a little let down on the post-shave experience from the brand. If you are looking for something that is non-alcohol based and really soothes your skin, try The Bluebeard&#x27;s Revenge post-shave balm ( another UK product). It is aloe and witch hazel based with a very nice feel. The Art of Shaving also has some nice products but I feel they are ridiculously priced..</li>
    <li> A dime-sized squirt covers my face.  It smells great, and calms the post-shave tingle down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the lime scent, but disappears quickly, and I normally use cologne.  This is too expensive for just the smell, since you can get the same skin benefits from using a six dollar bottle of Nivea Sensitive skin aftershave balm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a safety razor for a few months now (a Merkur, if you are shopping for one), and could not find an aftershave that could support it very well. I used many typical drugstore brands, such as Nivea, Neutrogena, and Gillette, and they did almost nothing for me. Some had alcohol in them, which burned my newly shaved skin and uncomfortably itched because of it. This product, however, is a dream come true. I would say I have slightly sensitive skin, and this worked wonders. I find that is is best used multiple times throughout your shave. By that I mean that I will put it on as a pre-shave oil (although it is not technically an oil), apply my lather with my badger brush, shave, rinse my face with hot water, pat it dry, apply more of the Limes Skin Food, and re-lather. I&#x27;ll repeat that process two to three times as needed, and finally end by rinsing my face with cold water and then applying the Limes Skin Food one final time. It&#x27;s a miracle. Very, very soothing and moisturizing, and it feels protective as well. The scent is great, yet not overpowering. You may want to consider putting on additional aftershave or cologne if you want to give of more of a manly smell. Also, a little goes a long way, so even a small bottle such as this 100mL version will last months. This product gets my highest recommendation. Just buy it already and have the best shave of your life!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have got this for my husband, he really likes it and asked for more. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Useful for when I can&#x27;t take a shower after shaving.  Neck is always red (with or without shower) immediately after using it (though there isn&#x27;t any irritation -- the redness goes away after a score of minutes.)  Don&#x27;t need to use much to address the whole shaved face.  The tangy smell rapidly goes away.</li>
    <li> It is ok. I like the scent. It is subtle lime then fades to whatever soap you used for the day. Overall, the feel post shave is not as good as others I have tried. I really like the Nivea aftershave balm. The best aftershaves I have used are the Soap Commander balm line of products. They are amazing and refreshing on my skin. I was kinda disappointed with the GFT skin food. I will use it until it is gone but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Shaving seems easier after using this after shaving for a week or so.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> Ah this is a very succesful formulation for pre/post shave lotion. I use it pre and after a shave and it leaves my face as new.although I shave twice a day.</li>
    <li> One day of use and I could feel a difference. Non-greasy feel (especially for the humid Floridian summers) &amp; my face didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing a mask like some moisturizers do. Highly recommend &amp; will make a part of my shave regimen from now on.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> From Pre-Shave to Post Shave, it&#x27;s a great unique product. It smells fresh and mixes beautifully with Geo F Coconut Shave Cream!!!</li>
    <li> This is great and reduces the amount of irritation I get with my DE safety razor greatly and tightens the face up nice after use. Leaves your face baby soft and takes little to do so. Only 4 stars because it is a bit pricey but a great product either way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I use it after shaving my legs. I use to have a bad skin irritation from shaving and this helped a lot.</li>
    <li> Has a subtle lime scent that does not necessarily bowl me over with approval. I&#x27;m not using this skin food as a cologne or after shave, so I do not need the scent to be pungent or linger. My objective in purchasing this product was to moisturize, protect against razor burn and add lubrication for a smooth razor glide. Does it do all these things? Yes. I have found however that it works best as a pre shave moisturizer. I use Obsession after shave balm by Calvin Klein, and it relieves razor burn as well as moisturize my face after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geo F. Trumper Limes Skin Food works, only I&#x27;ve found better solutions to meet my shaving objectives. This product will not find a permanent home in my medicine cabinet. I purchased this product based on the positive reviews it received here on Amazon. I&#x27;m giving it four stars however because it works, but it&#x27;s not for me. Cheers!!!</li>
    <li> For me, the GFT Skin Food is easily one of the best pre/post shave balms I have used.  If you are on the fence about this product, go ahead &amp; get it.  Do not worry about the price point, as a very little bit of this product (penny size) is enough to cover most people&#x27;s entire face &amp; neck.  Overall, a very good product that I think most will enjoy.</li>
    <li> Super-soothing after-shave lotion. It comfortingly does the job and leaves your face feeling pampered after a workout shave. Pleasant smell is not overwhelming and dissipates quickly. I prefer this light lotion to the astringent, barber shop smell of others like Proraso. A little does a lot by the way. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite aftershave lotion, and my skin sucks it right up!  I wish the scent was a little stronger, but other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not limes but lemons. The product itself is great. But I really hoped it would smell like limes.&lt;br /&gt;Smell lasts only 5-10 min so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
    <li> I use this as a preshave instead of after shave an love the results. Worth every cent.</li>
    <li> What food ? has nothing but chemicals in it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., Astragalus Gummifer, Parfum Fragrance, Menthol, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Citral, Limonene, CI 19140 FDC YELLOW 5.</li>
    <li> A bit watery but works well and smells great.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a perfectionist at shaving then you would definitely know the value of this little bottle of \\&quot;wonder\\&quot; which was made to compliment a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a rookie or a normal guy, like me, when it comes to shaving then this is a highly recommended product to compliment you otherwise \\&quot;rough\\&quot; shaving experiences. Do the maths and the search (save you time coz I did it just like you are at this moment) this product would come up on your all time top 5 shaving products to have and even though it may seem a little steep in the cost I can assure you that you need just a tiny little amount and the bottle goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way don&#x27;t take my word for it go ahead and try it and then you can share your review on your experience just like the other users of this product.</li>
    <li> Use a dime sized amount after shaving and your face will feel cool, fresh and smell subtly like limes.  After drying, the face feels tighter and smoother throughout the day.  My pores are noticeably less oily after use.  The bottle may be expensive, but you use so little after a shave it&#x27;s going to take quite a long time to empty the bottle.  The expense is worth it!</li>
    <li> Great aftershave! This aftershave feels great, smells great, and protects the skin after a shave.  It doesnt leave any weird residue, dries quickly, and leaves your skin feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> My fav. Shaving product I mix it with my proraso pre shave and mix it with my proraso aftershave. If I use an electric razor I&#x27;ll apply. And sometimes just to give my skin a good glow I&#x27;ll put some on. Should be on every guys sink.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay so far.  Not too much better than regular lotion from what I can tell.  It rubs in fine but price wise I expected a bigger bottle. Lime scent is refreshing but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m told the Prince of Wales uses it. It&#x27;s subtle and soothes the face. Doesn&#x27;t dry one out. I like it but would prefer a different way of dispensing it.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff leaves my face feeling clean sets well after drying provides quick healing of any bumps a little expensive though</li>
    <li> smell s nice omg the cost for that small bolttle i guess paying for fancy name brand it was ok nt to happy with it</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great. I use it as a pre shave and an after shave. One of the best lim scents around.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin - especially on my neck. Trumper&#x27;s skin food is soothing and helps me recover quickly after shaving. It eliminates irritation and dryness without being oily. I won&#x27;t use any other product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great for my skin and smells great.  A little expensive.</li>
    <li> Truthfully I think it&#x27;s one of the better after shave balms I have used, and I have used many. But my question is... where&#x27;s the lime? It&#x27;s apparent for a millisecond only. For the cost of a tiny bottle, I think I should be blown away with fresh limes. Nope. Not with this. Decent product but better spent on Lucky Tiger... you get the same nice smooth feeling on your face, a nice dash of fresh scent, and four times the product for less money.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Trumper&#x27;s West Indian Limes Skin Food. (What is it about those West Indian Limes?) Actually, this is my third bottle of Skin Food, if you include the sandalwood version into the equation. The lime is, IMHO, preferable to the sandalwood. The lime is cooling and refreshing after a shave, and the light scent is not overpowering. A 100ml bottle will last me the largest part of a year. This is something I will continue to use and recommend.</li>
    <li> Leaves a nice lime smell that isn&#x27;t over powering. Does go away farely quickly. Feels great on the skin.  fffd</li>
    <li> Up until now I&#x27;ve only used face lotion post shave. This is one of those things you have to try out to understand. It some how makes my face extra smooth and the scent is light and fresh. I don&#x27;t like heavily scented face products that stay with you all day. This has a light, clean smell, that dissipates fairly quickly, and that&#x27;s a good thing for me.</li>
    <li> This may be the best aftershave I have ever used.  It&#x27;s a great scent and does not feel greasy when it goes on.  Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels awesome on my skin post shave. I feel like a proper civilized human being after using it.</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant citrus smell but not very powerful and not very enduring. The sensation on the skin is satisfying, perhaps a bit sticky but only for a few moments. Absorbs very fast, not shiny, non-drying. Not as fantastic as I expected but still very nice. I would say try it once and decide for yourself. I&#x27;m going to try a cheaper aftershave before I buy another bottle. It&#x27;s good just not sure it&#x27;s 25$ good.</li>
    <li> A great product. Works great as a pre-shave oil, also smells great. This item is part of my shaving routine and I would have a problem without it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It is now my favorite aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must buy.</li>
    <li> Great scent and fantastic pre shave conditioner as well as aftershave.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff when it comes to aftershave, I wouldn&#x27;t bother with any other brand.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome aftershave, it soaks into the skin right away and the scent is very subtle and pleasing. A few drops do the job so it will last months. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff - lemon lime heaven. Fades quickly though, so don&#x27;t expect to notice after you put it on. Does a good job of conditioning after the shave, soaks in well.</li>
    <li> This was a little more liquidy than I expected, but the scent is not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t last very long; it does smell good though, light and refreshing. I&#x27;m estimating that this bottle will last 3 months or so - at least (I shave about 3 times a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a very good job at soothing skin after shaving, and after about a minute, my neck was no longer red and could barely feel the burn anymore. I will more than likely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great after shave feel and great aftershave scent. I tried the Coral and Sandalwood as well and I think they all feel great on my skin and do help with razor rash and burn. The Coral is too strong flowery of a smell. The Sandalwood is nice. I think I like the Lime the best.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few days and I would say that its okay.  There really is nothing special about it as far as I can feel or see.  I uploaded a picture for all to see that the bottle is very small and is almost the size of a tweezerman deluxe shaving brush.  Will I buy this again for $29?  Probably not.</li>
    <li> A great product.  A tiny dime size amount will cover your face after a shave.  Very soothing, very nice and subtle scent.  I definitely did not want a product that had a strong smell.  My face feels great after using this product.  I was using Baxter Of California Alcohol Free Shave Balm.  That too is a great after shave balm.  However, I didn&#x27;t like that it used parabens so I decided to try the Skin Food.  I actually like Geo F. Trumper Limes Skin Food better than Baxter of California Shave Balm, and it doesn&#x27;t use parabens.  I highly recommend Geo F. Trumper Limes Skin food!</li>
    <li> After trying this-- I agree one drop does wonders.  I really like it and the scent.  So much I bought my Brother some for Christmas. I&#x27;m not sure if it moisturizes my skin well but it does make it feel great after a shave and relieve any irritation.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I shave every 2-3 days and it&#x27;s last me just about a year. The smell was less lime than expected but it leaves the skin feeling great. Is it worth the money? Not sure. I switched to Proraso after shave and my face feels just as good.</li>
    <li> The ingedients are not the best, it contains Yellow #5. However, the use of menthol and other natural ingredients does leave skin refreshed briefly. The scent is nice and light, but this has no longevity in regards to how well it moisturizes the skin. I have a very sensitive skin with a pretty tough beard, and this just doesn&#x27;t cut it as an aftershave. If using it as a pre-shave oil, it works better, however, i prefer Proraso&#x27;s White Pre-Shave Cream.</li>
    <li> I have several post shave products, but this is my favorite by far. All of the accolades that I read of this product are not hype.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is not too heavy, it conditions the skin well and has a pleasant smell. I will continue to buy Trumper&#x27;s Skin Food.</li>
    <li> I tried this after seeing Geofatboy recommend it in a video and learned of the Trumper brand. I do like it quite a bit to finish my shave (I switch between many products), still haven&#x27;t tried it as a pre-shave as I&#x27;ve seen alternatively recommended. Of everything I&#x27;ve tried though, my favorite spot has to be (currently) reserved for some of Truefitt &amp; Hill&#x27;s aftershave balms, which kind of \\&quot;melt\\&quot; into your face and absorb very nicely. That&#x27;s a personal preference, and if you&#x27;re just getting into wet shaving as I have, I recommend you try various brands and products to see which best work for you. There is SO much more out there than the stinging alcohol aftershave products!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It smells very good when you put it on, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stay with you for more than a few minutes. This is exactly what I want, since I spent lots of money getting colognes and I&#x27;d rather my aftershave doesn&#x27;t overpower them. A little product goes a long way here; I&#x27;ve had my bottle over a month and have barely made a dent. A dime sized drop of this will cover your beard area, and even your entire face if you want. Try to only use a couple fingers to apply so your fingers/palms don&#x27;t absorb half the product as you apply to face. This stuff is slightly sticky/tacky, but that goes away rapidly leaving nice soft moisturized skin.</li>
    <li> Smelled great. Performance was similar to the gilette after shave that can be found in Walmart for a couple dollars.</li>
    <li> I started using this in place of some art of shaving after shave balm.  This goes on really nice, smells good, and makes my skin feel great!  A little goes a long way.  I bet this little bottle will last me at least 6 months and I use it 5-6 times per week.</li>
    <li> This is great. My skin feels great after using this product. Make sure you get all of the shaving cream off your face with cold water before you use this. Great product.</li>
    <li> Smells like limes but not over powering.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but this stuff works on even the nastiest razor burns.  Warning:  a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> We were enticed by rave reviews all over the internet about Trumpers&#x27; \\&quot;Skin Food\\&quot; being one of the best after-shave products money could buy.  Now an owner, we&#x27;re not so thrilled.  First, it is several orders of magnitude more expensive than a nice Nivea or even Afta calming after-shave balm.  Indeed, the product is more a \\&quot;splash\\&quot; than a \\&quot;balm\\&quot; - it has almost no viscosity at all, although we will grant that it quickly fades any post-shave irritation.  Unfortunately, so does the pleasant scent - you&#x27;ll be lucky to catch even a hint after just a couple of minutes.  Also, for those that care, the fifth ingredient is alcohol, which many prefer to avoid in their facial care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, we were expecting something considerably more spectacular.  In reality, this is little better than common drugstore equivalents at mere fractions of the cost.  While we don&#x27;t hate it, there will be no encore!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is pleasant and not over powering. It allows for a smooth shave with no razor burn. I us it as to mostorize after shave.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few \\&quot;upscale\\&quot; after shave balms.  From The Art of Shaving, to Truefitt &amp; Hill.  I must say I was at first apprehensive about this skin food as I couldn&#x27;t find too many reviews on-line about it.  I am pleasantly surprised.  Not only does it do an excellent job as an after shave balm, it&#x27;s great to use as a \\&quot;pre-shave oil\\&quot; even though it&#x27;s not really an oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you have sensitive skin like me.  It will not disappoint you and it seems to last for a long time.  This skin food seems to seal in moisture and isn&#x27;t really too greasy.  You should apply this sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had just about every Truefitt &amp; Hill aftershave balm and their pre-shave oil but the more I use this it makes me realize how much better Trumper&#x27;s is for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You owe it to yourself to at least try the small 100ml bottle.  I&#x27;m really considering selling my Truefitt &amp; Hill aftershave balms and pre-shave oils just to stick with this skin food permanently.</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive for the amount you get, no beating around the bush. However, it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used - and by a significant margin. While most aftershave balms feel like lotion variants, Trumpers skin food seems to pull all the moisture from the surrounding area into your face. I&#x27;ve never felt anything like it; it&#x27;s glorious! (I also use it as a pre-shave)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasing and lingers just long enough. Skin food is an excellent companion to Trumpers shaving cream, which is a marvelous product itself. Together, they&#x27;ll elevate shaving into a luxurious experience. You owe it to yourself to try it out.</li>
    <li> I do not know how Geo Trumper does it but this is seriously the best pre/after shave balm. I even add a few drops to my cream and it simply delivers great protection. I love the skin food so much I purchased every scent available.</li>
    <li> At first I was a little skeptical because of the price and quantity.  After reading other reviews about how little you need to use, I figured I would give it a try.  It&#x27;s a great light product and you really only need a few drops to cover your face.  (I use about 3 drops in the palm of my hands, rub together and can apply to my entire face.)  The smell is super fresh and is not overpowering.  I am very happy with the purchase.  This stuff goes a long ways!</li>
    <li> Great lemony smell and makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Excellent, soothing, good-smelling stuff.  A nice non-alcohol based aftershave that does not dry your skin out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in conjunction with the GFT limes shaving cream. This product is great. I love the scent, not too strong and fades in a short time. They definitely got the title right, it is skin food. Very refreshing to use once you finish your shave. I am not a fan of the alcohol based aftershaves so I always look for something soothing without the burn. This certainly fits that bill. It&#x27;s thinner than a lotion and thicker than a splash, if that makes sense, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film behind. I love it!  Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I personally have never used an after-shave product, so when I decided to order this product, I had no idea what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving all my hair off with my double-edge razor, I applied a reviewer-recommended small dime-sized portion on my hand and dabbed it on my face.  Initially, there was a brief flash of a stinging sensation as the balm worked its way through my skin.  Afterwards, it commanded a soothing calm on my skin.  Even thirty minutes after application, I can feel my skin is more lively than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for a person who is exploring an after-shave product for their first time, as the skin feels really good after use and you cannot go wrong with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please note the bottle is a good size for what this product offers - this will last you a long time if you only use dime-sized portions every shave.</li>
    <li> At first I thought the price was a little high, but that changed the first time I used it. The smell is great. All you need is about a dime size, so you really do get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> A few drops goes a long way. Wonderful west Indies lime notes..</li>
    <li> I just have to say that this and other scents of the skin food are amazing. I&#x27;m a woman and this helps prevent razor bumps for me if I want to be bikini ready. Seriously, it works amazingly and a little goes a very long way!!! Buy it! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product once so far, but plan on using this until it runs out. I was a little disappointment in this product for a couple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.) It feels extremely over priced based on the tiny amount that you actually receive.I paid $17.25/100ml. For people not familiar with the metric system, that&#x27;s 3.38oz or just under half a cup.&lt;br /&gt;2.) It smells more like Sprite soda than actual limes.&lt;br /&gt;3.) It made my skin feel dry once the product dried.&lt;br /&gt;4.) The smell disappeared within seconds of drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing this product has going for it, is that it takes a very small amount to thoroughly cover my face. I guess I was let down because this product was overly hyped. I will continue to use this product, and if my opinion changes than I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 2/9/2015 (After a month of using this product)***&lt;br /&gt;I still feel that this product is over hyped. There are much better aftershaves on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- It takes about 3 to 5 drops to cover my face. After several shaves I have barely made a dent on this product.&lt;br /&gt;- Because it takes so little, this small bottle will probably last you several months.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve come to like the lime smell, and my initial review saying that it smelt like Sprite was premature.&lt;br /&gt;- No sting, unless you&#x27;re somebody that enjoys the sting.&lt;br /&gt;- I have fairly sensitive skin that never fails to break out in razor burn. This product combined with an alum block have eliminated my razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Still leaves my face feeling dry, I was initially hoping that it would be more like a balm or lotion but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;- Still a little pricey, but since it should last several months the price is no longer an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;- The scent dissipates fairly quickly, within 5 minutes the scent is gone.&lt;br /&gt;- Still over hyped</li>
    <li> This stuff feels nice and does help moisturize the skin. Watch out if you have oily skin though because it caused me to break out in the oily areas of my face. So i have to be careful not to hit those areas when i use this stuff.</li>
    <li> Had a product question, contacted G. Trumper and received an almost immediate reply. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it&#x27;s mostly a lightly scented tacky goo. Going back to Castle Forbes products.</li>
    <li> Great smelling aftershave that goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy. The smell of the lime extract is fantastic (wife loves it too) and there&#x27;s not much needed for the entire face. It is pricey for the size if bottle, but I think it&#x27;s worth it if you already have invested in some solid shaving gear.</li>
