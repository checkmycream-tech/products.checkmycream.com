<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This  is the third bottle I used. lots of my friends told me it really works. if it is your last 4 weeks of pregnancy, it is suggested that using the formula as frequently as possible, because the baby grow so fast that the belly is always itchy.</li>
    <li> I like the product but the pump does not work.</li>
    <li> a must have for any pregnant woman!!!</li>
    <li> I went through a bottle of the oil and 3 bottles of the cocoa butter lotion during my first pregnancy from 5 months on. I applied at least 3-4 times a day and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks. Well I got 2 tiny ones that are nearly invisible, so they don&#x27;t count. I&#x27;m pregnant again and starting to get the ichies again. I&#x27;m dying to get my hands on this oil again. My Walgreens doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
    <li> This stuff kind of stinks! (Literally)</li>
    <li> Palmers Cocoa Butter relieved the itchiness and soothed my skin the moment I applied it to my skin.  I was glad to finally find a product that actually worked as described.  The pump makes it easier to apply to the skin.  I will continue using this product.  I highly recommend it to anyone who suffers from dry, itchy skin.</li>
    <li> This oil has prevented my legs from itching! It really helps that it comes out as a spray so I do not have to spread it on my hands first! I will continue to buy this!</li>
    <li> Glad I checked the ingredients BEFORE I purchased!!  CANOLA OIL listed as the first one.  Cheap toxic canola oil.</li>
    <li> The product feels good on the skin and smells good but the bottle sprayer is uncooperative once hands get into the oil. I would have given 4.5 stars if the sprayer worked better. I find that the Misto olive oil sprayer is a better applicator for dispensing this product. I recommend both products.</li>
    <li> the fragrance is so strong.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin.  Especially good for feet and elbows.</li>
    <li> I love this spray on cocoa butter, it&#x27;s very hassle free! The oil comes out in a mist and leaves my body feeling moisturized and soft; it is a lot less messy than lotion. I do wish this product came in a bigger size but it is good for the sale price.</li>
    <li> had forgotten how good this product is from my teen years.  Now much later, I found it and used it and received the highest results probably possible.  Had very dry skin and applied this directly after showering.  Wow!  Whata difference a few weeks has made.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Relieved my dry skin and left me very comfortable. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> The spray lid was broken upon arrival.  So annoying.  I have had this problem several times with amazon items.</li>
    <li> completely stopped the itching and smells great. it also doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy. i would definitely reccommend this product</li>
    <li> No stretch marks after two kids! I know everyone&#x27;s different but it worked for me!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve never let me down and this oil is simply perfect 👌</li>
    <li> I am having twins and having very bad itching, tried so many oils and ice cubs nothing worked out for me. I tried this, applied twice a day or whenever I need or where ever I need. It immediately controls the itching and sooth the skin.. Thanks to this product. I am more relaxed and less worries about itching. Defiantly recommend to friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this item before. It still does the job relieving itchy skin. The spray is perfect and it rubs in quickly.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and live in the desert- I buy a lot of different moisturizing products. I liked how this one was sprayable and an oil, which I think makes a longer lasting and more intensive hydrating barrier than lotions and even creams. I use it on most of my body after a shower. The formula itself so far is okay- I wish it felt a little more moisturizing, but on the flip side, it is not too greasy, probably a trade-off. The deal breaker for me, though, is the smell. I know people in other recommendations seem to like or hate it. I was expecting a heavy coconut smell. It&#x27;s much more artificial smelling and not really coconut- something chemical and just slightly, vaguely unpleasant. Not bad, but not good. I will be looking at other oil for my next purchase, hopefully also with a spray top!</li>
    <li> Good quality! the same as picture shows!&lt;br /&gt;Good package! a little scrape on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;my friend was happy to receive this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite stuff!!  Easy to apply. Just spray and rub it. Smell is nice too!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been as itchy since using this product. 36 weeks pregnant now and not a single stretch mark. I did only start using this one from about 28 weeks but was using the other palmers spray oil for getting rid of stretch marks. lol. Apparently I didnt read the bottle clearly but seemed to do just fine anyway.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for my itchy skin. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> Currently using on surgery scars.  Seems to be doing the job!</li>
    <li> Helped soo much with the itching.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  Wish it smelled better.</li>
    <li> The smell is so strong I cannot stand it</li>
    <li> This is my third baby, and my belly is stretched to the max.  This soothing oil is like magic in a bottle, I put it on every morning, and every night... and if I have time, I also put it on at lunch.  My skin feels amazing, and no longer itches!  I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> Bought this to use for stretch marks after having baby. This has helped reduce the appearance of them and along with using Eucerin lotion, provides an extra layer of moisturizing protection for the winter months.</li>
    <li> I used the oil throughout my pregnancy combined with the cocoa cutter formula and I did not have any stretch mark.&lt;br /&gt;The oil dries pretty fast but I did stained a shirt or two before realizing I had to wait a few minutes before dressing up!</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT , GOOD CARE OF SELLER</li>
    <li> I used Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter cream when I was pregnant 36 years ago, and it was an excellent product. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think to try this Palmer&#x27;s product when I started experiencing dry, itchy skin on my legs. I guess I thought there had to be something better and more &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; on the market after all these years, but after trying a ton of products, I finally ordered Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Soothing Oil, and the results have been nothing short of miraculous.  I&#x27;m having no itching at all, and my legs feel great. I will never be without this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this has worked for the other reviewers who sing it&#x27;s praises. I wanted to like it, I really did. I use jojoba oil every night - in large amounts - to stem the pregnancy dry skin itch, but to no avail now that I&#x27;m in the 3rd trimester and on top of that it&#x27;s very, very cold in winter. Since this was sold as a solution for dry, itchy pregnancy skin - I have to give it one stars because it didn&#x27;t do what it said. At all. I was really looking forward to this. If you don&#x27;t have itchy skin, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer for pregnancy. I&#x27;m sure I will use it after pregnancy at least to use it up instead of wasting money. But if you have dry skin itchiness, just get something like Sarna brand anti steroid cream for those itchy spots like I ended up doing a week after buying this. The other issue with this product is the spray bottle function. I know, I know, that seems kind of nit picky - but just try applying oil using a pump spray and the bottle is getting oily, the pump stops working because your hands are slipping from the oil and cannot press the pump hard enough, then the entire cap with the pump starts turning and coming open. I had to laugh. Would have been better if they had just had a small pour spout or squirt type function.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd trimester and unlucky to have so much stretch marks on my belly. I use this oil whenever I feel itchy and for me it helps by massaging the oil on my belly. I&#x27;m just not a great fan of cocoa butter smell..</li>
    <li> I have Itchy Dry Skin not just during the cool weather months. I have itchy dry skin year round. I tried Palmer&#x27;s Itchy Dry Skin Soothing Oil and after using it twice a day for a few weeks my skin feels better. This oil not only soothed my skin it smells great too!</li>
    <li> With the effect is good, to my friends also bought persisted</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s products have been around forever - priced right and good for moisturizing skin as it is designed to.  Great for  those drying winter months after a bath.</li>
    <li> Most of my Amazon orders are here within the week and this took longer. It smells a lot like coco butter so if you do not like that scent, don&#x27;t get it. I was injured and completely immobile for 7 months and got nasty stretch marks on my thighs. There are deep so I&#x27;m using coco and shea butter lotion with aloe vera gel (alternating days) at night I am using this oil. In the past I used coconut oil and palmers lotion for stretch marks but that wasn&#x27;t helping for my new ones. I&#x27;m hoping that this does, it has been two days and my skin is already softer.</li>
    <li> During my pregnancy I was dealing with the dry cold of North Dakota. There were nights I couldn&#x27;t sleep because my stomach was so dry and itchy that I couldn&#x27;t stand it. I was using Palmer&#x27;s lotion to try and soothe the itch, and it worked to some degree but not enough. I ordered this and the first time I used it I was able to sleep the entire night! Loved it! I will be using this again for my next pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I would have for this is how oily my hands were after applying the soothing oil on my stomach, but seriously you can&#x27;t expect any less. The pro side is that my hands didn&#x27;t itch because they weren&#x27;t dried out anymore either. ^^ Absolutely love the soothing oil!</li>
    <li> I love almost all the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter products.  This is an oil spray and works extremely well for very dry winter skin.  It is oil, so you should probably cover area after use in order to keep the mess down.</li>
    <li> I loved this spray. I use it all over and you can even spray your back.  I didn&#x27;t realize it was for pregnancy. Lol&lt;br /&gt;:</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use it. My young sister like this product.</li>
    <li> This goes on easily and soaks in quickly with no greasy feeling. I not only use if after a shower, but also directly on dry skin throughout the day. It works perfectly either way. This is another amazing Palmer&#x27;s product!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good product in healing itching. No words to say it&#x27;s wrong from my end.&lt;br /&gt; it can be advisable for who is interested..</li>
    <li> I used it throughout my pregnancy (in conjunction with lanolin oil, which is too thick to apply on the skin on its own). Not one stretch mark. But I guess everybody&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
    <li> Last pregnancy I used plain cocoa butter, but I found that despite the slathering, I still using the backs of my nails to gently scratch my belly and sides of my abs...well, what abs were left. Anyway, with the oil I&#x27;ve noticed that I actually have to do no such thing and that it keeps my skin moisturized, smelling nice, and not too oily all day. I spray it on after a shower, dab off, then voila. Hope women looking for itch relief due to oversized baby get some help here.</li>
    <li> Does not relieve itching. Don&#x27;t be deceived. If you think you&#x27;re going to spray this on ur belly and get instant itchiness relief, not the case at all. This is essentially just an oil. It does smell good and I can&#x27;t say how good it works on stretch marks yet, but it has not relieved my itchiness one bit. My belly just stared to get stretch marks on the bottom at 35 weeks. I&#x27;m currently 38 weeks and the itchiness sometimes keeps me up at night (and I put stretch mark cream on my belly twice a day). I bought this in the hopes that I could spray it and feel some sort of of relief at night. Nope. Gives the same amount of relief as any regular cream I have at home, which is to say, not much.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the hopes of combating stretch marks due to pregnancy. The smell made me I&#x27;ll and the oil wouldn&#x27;t soak into my skin.</li>
    <li> My wife makes fun of me because of the picture of a pregnant lady on the bottle. My dry skin is super dry and itchy during the cold and dry winters in Chicago and so my wife&#x27;s ridicule bounces off of me like bullets off superman. This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Cruelty-free, cheap and it works! Win Win Win!</li>
    <li> My wife used this religiously while pregnant. She is delighted to report that even after pregnancy she has no stretch marks. She attributes this largely to her using this oil.</li>
    <li> The smell is quite pleasant and it surely helps my itchy skin. Hope it will also prevent strech marks later.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it. I mix it together with Shea Butter and use it for my body. The texture of my skin is very soft and smooth -  like baby&#x27;s skin. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I spray it on my tummy after every bath. It moisture it very well and does not stick. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my very dry winter skin. Highly recommend. Not only for mothers, works for anyone with extremely dry skin and smells great, too..</li>
    <li> This product is very good, genuine goods at a fair price, use rise very comfortable, especially suitable for pregnant women, but also itching, with a good effect. Worth having.</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly and was neatly packaged. I really like this it keeps my skin soft and supple, it smells great and I am almost at my due date and there are no stretch marks and I have no irritating itching! It is also winter now and most other moisturisers do not hold up, my skin dries up but the Palmers just keeps on going. Happy customer!</li>
    <li> I like this. It made my dry elbows super soft and even worked on my boyfriend. It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell which I like and it soaks in relatively fast. Don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;Associated with pregnancy&amp;#34; theme turn you off of this product- it&#x27;s great for anyone.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry skin. Wish it had less chemicals though</li>
    <li> My legs dry out quick from riding my Harley in the winter and this is the best stuff for it.  The smell is great almost like you could drink it,</li>
    <li> The only good thing that I can say about this product is that it absorbs well for an oil and smells pretty good.  However, it made me itch more and gave me a rash.  In addition, the bottle does not last very long so its quite costly if you want to use it continuously.  I would say two-three weeks for a daily user. I can&#x27;t recommend if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Have used Palmer&#x27;s for years; I find it an essential part of my body&#x27;s skin protection, especially in cold weather.</li>
    <li> not what i expected but i will use it anyway but i will not order this product in the near future</li>
    <li> my better half asks for it on her back after every shower</li>
    <li> fast shipping, I love this product!</li>
    <li> I use Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter lotion but wanted something a bit lighter to use intermittently.  I absolutely love this product and find the spray to be very convenient!</li>
    <li> Coco butter is wonderful. I have a bottle in the shower,  I forget to lotion-up too often; after a steamy shower, I spray on, rub in and gently towel dry.  Lovely soft fragrance and powerful anti-aging properties.</li>
    <li> Shipped great did not leak or anything was at my house much sooner than expected and great product of recconmend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This helps to reach the dry patches on your back during the winter months and helps to calm the dry skin, but with regards to pregnancy-related stretch marks, after about 2 weeks of consistent use in combination with the massage cream, I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant reduction in stretch mark appearance... will keep trying though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and applied this after a shower. It still hadn&#x27;t absorbed by the time I had to get dressed half hour later and I wiped it off the best I could. I haven&#x27;t tried it again since that initial time as regular lotion seems to be working fine for now.</li>
    <li> also good for the hair. this product is handy for places i cant reach now that i am prego. but i rather use hollywood coco butter because i can see a difference in my skin tone in a weeks time.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love this stuff, i use so much of it and it great for Summer dry and winter dry skin, I use it year round and you can put this in your bath,</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to spray on my legs after showering since they get so dry...especially in winter.  I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter oil and wanted something lighter that wasn&#x27;t quite so oily.  This oil is nice and light and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;m not sure if the spray bottle contributes to that effect by dispersing it over a wider area as opposed to dumping it in your hand to start.  The spray bottle is awkward for me to use.  The easiest way to get leverage to spray is to hold the bottle upside down but then it won&#x27;t spray.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a non-issue for most people but I prefer the oil you dump in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil itself is AWESOME!!  Nice and light and a very neutral almost non-fragrance.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot but the pump is not so good - slips if your hands are wet right out of the shower. The oil is very smooth and one of the best. Plus it is pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great!</li>
    <li> I was worried that this would be messy in that I would be able to, say, use it before I got dressed for work.  That is not the case.  You can spray in on, rub it in (or not, if you are spraying hard to reach areas like your back), and get dressed after only a few minutes.  It soaks right in.  For some reason, I have had itchy dry skin on my shins and this little miracle worked wonders.  It is also excellent for those hard to reach areas, it sprays on my back without any problem.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My OBGYN has told me countless times....lotion has nothing to do with preventing stretch marks. I&#x27;m not so sure...I used this oil and Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter for stretch marks and chugged 3-4 liters of water every day of my pregnancy. I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks on my stomach and I gained 40 pounds.</li>
    <li> This is working so well for me. I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy it. No itching or stretching so far. I&#x27;m Happy.</li>
    <li> best product for pregnancy women, help with itchy skin/stretch mark</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but I don&#x27;t like the smell but it&#x27;s manageable</li>
    <li> I really like it, it hidratates a lot and also smells so good, i bought it and i have had and excellent expirience.</li>
    <li> I spray it on a wash clothe and enjoy the feeling on my skin</li>
    <li> I am 6 months pregnant and I purchased this (along with some other Palmer&#x27;s lotion) to keep my belly moisturized to help prevent stretch marks. While I can&#x27;t say whether this and the lotion have worked any magic (No stretch marks-yet-but we all know that&#x27;s mainly genetics too!), I do know it makes my growing belly feel very moisturized without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
    <li> It had a bad smell and I just didn&#x27;t like it.Okay it was a mess to try and put on your skin.</li>
