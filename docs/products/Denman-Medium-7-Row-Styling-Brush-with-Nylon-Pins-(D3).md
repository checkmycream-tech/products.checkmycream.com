      <li>Honestly I havent seen my hair shine this much in a while</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received my item on time but was very disappointed! It is poorly made! As soon as I started using it the bristles started lifting up off the base. It was not glued or anything. A waste of my money!</li>
    <li> This brush works wonders on my 3c/4a hair !!!</li>
    <li> I have 4C hair and this brush has done wonders for my hair and it still keeps my curls to gether even when I use it after doing bantu knots and roller sets. Great for detangling my hair as well</li>
    <li> Love it. High quality favorite brush in my drawer.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush for de tangling!</li>
    <li> Received the item as promised.  Great price!</li>
    <li> The brush is wonderful. Glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> Love the denman brush! Makes my curls look 3 times more defined</li>
    <li> The brush was exactly as described at an excellent price and was delivered a day ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> beautiful brush, a real classic</li>
    <li> For some reason it doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair unless my hair is partially damp. A big teeth comb works better for me but i still use it now and then.</li>
    <li> I love my Denman brush. To me it&#x27;s more like a comb because I use it to define my curls when my hair is wet. I wet my hair and add my Herbal Essences Hello hydration conditioner or any leave in and it really makes my curls pop. My hair is a mixture of 3b and 3c spirally curls but its Super thick/dense. My daughter on the other hand has 3c and 4a coils and it works great on her hair as well. I would have never thought I&#x27;d pay over $5 for a brush/comb but it is definitely worth it ladies.😃</li>
    <li> If you want a brush to comb out natural African American hair without tugging, this is the brush.  I have purchased this brush for every female in my family because of the quality.  They all speak volumes about this brush and it is now a staple in my beauty arsenal.</li>
    <li> I was very curious about it after seeing all the post on various social media  by other naturalistas, and I was not disappointed. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. My hair gets detangled and stays detangled! I have natural 4c hair and it made detangling so much easier</li>
    <li> I purchased this to keep my curls in tact.... terrible. cause frizz SO MUCH FRIZZ &amp; cause the product in my hair to come off due to how hard it is which is why I got a lot of frizz and dry unmanageable hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hairbrush.  My last one lasted me for years.</li>
    <li> When I decided to start my natural hair journey one of the products I often heard about was the denman brush. It works very well on detangling my natural 4b curls as well as my curly 3b wigs. Even now that I am no longer on my natural hair journey, I still love using the brush on my straight styles!</li>
    <li> ordering a second one (the 9 row) for my gym locker. great detangler (esp for kids). I use it every day wet in the shower to do conditioner rinses on 3C hair. Also great for natural hair to regain curl when hair is frizzing.</li>
    <li> It is a very well made brush.  Works great.  Very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> This is a really good hairbrush. I have lots of thick, unruly hair, and this does the trick without all the pulling. It is able to withstand high temperatures from the hair dryer too. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> it is not what its cracked up to be also when I received the package it was smashed up one of the bristles are bent so its not my hair when I brush it.  it really is not worth the price the counterfeit I have to admit verses are stronger and gets to the hair much better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for teasing my fine hair, it works great. It doesn&#x27;t damage the hair and gives perfect volume. I found it difficult for styling and brushing my hair though, my hair is ling and tangles easily and this brush really pulled it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! I&#x27;m natural and my hair is thick so it really helps detangle my hair on wash days and distributes the product evenly through my hair. This is a must buy and I&#x27;m glad I finally purchased it!</li>
    <li> Great, I love this brush . I truly detangles w/o pulling out all of my hair. I will tell everyone to buy the product.</li>
    <li> I really liked how this brush made my curls pop along with gel, but after looking at the brush I was not happy. This brush was modified by removing half the rows to be used in Natural 4 hair. I used this on wet hair that was detangled with a wide tooth comb first.  I found several strands in the hair and I continued to find strands after every brush pass through. So this brush will go to the graveyard. Curlies beware!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Denman 7 Row Styling Brush for about 20 years. I first started using it when I would blow dry my relaxed hair, and I continued to use it after I stopped relaxing 15 years ago. I love love love it for brushing my curly curly hair!! It adds definition to my curls and is a blessing when it comes to detangling hair. This is a sturdy brush that may be too rigid for some people--especially those with fine hair.  I&#x27;ve tried the larger 9 row styling brush from Denman, but it&#x27;s not strong enough even though it has more rows. Those 9 rows are just too flexible, so I highly recommend the 7 row brush. My 3c/4a mane needs to be tamed sometimes and allowed to go wild at other times, so this is the brush for me--forever and always!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush!  My hair has never been this awesome!  No more tangles at the root, no dryness, and best of all, no frizz.  The order arrived two days before I expected it too.  Great job and thanks!</li>
    <li> Great price, been looking for this brush for a long time. Denman brushes are absolutely great. You can&#x27;t buy a better hair brush.</li>
    <li> Looks like the picture</li>
    <li> This brush does it all, I never need a comb. The conair knock off doesn&#x27;t compare to this awesome product</li>
    <li> Best hairbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. Much easier to style my hair which is medium length.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome!  It really works to untangle curly hair.  It does not require a lot of brushing and I have not experienced a lot of hair coming out as a result of a vigorous brushing.  I recommend it highly for all types of hair, especially for weaved hair.</li>
    <li> Was pretty happy with my brush the first few weeks but as I use it and comb out my hair it&#x27;s starting to tear at the end.  Thought this was suppose to be a high quality brush..</li>
    <li> Absolutely a great brush for coily,kinky,curly hair. Materials its made of are soft but stirdy. Would love to buy more for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Great brush to lift your hair up in the front and to give a natural lift. Makes your hair look great</li>
    <li> Ordered this brush june 3rd got it today june 5th. Fast shipping came undamaged. Havent used the brush yet but so far very satisfied. Will update when i actually use the brush.  Update: so I used the brush on my natural curly 4a/4b and it worked great. Both wet and dry. And it works great on my done natural curly 4b/4c. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great for detangling  wet or hair.</li>
    <li> Really good brush. Made my curls flawless. Well recommended.</li>
    <li> WILL NEVER USE ANY OTHER BRUSH.</li>
    <li> Great brush... I purchased one more...</li>
    <li> I have had a Denman brush for a number of years and my granddaughter loved it so much, I purchased one for her too. Denman brushes are much kinder to the hair and I would have no hesitation in recommending one.</li>
    <li> I like the brush. I am black and Once I comb from my ends to the root there is not that much pulling on my hair and with the right moisturizers it really brings out my curl pattern.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love my Denman brush! I&#x27;m so glad that I invested in it! I did not modify mine - I use it with all 7 rows of pins and it doesn&#x27;t catch or pull my hair. It easily detangles my hair and adds great definition to my curls, even in areas that lack a definite curl pattern. Did I mention that I love this brush?</li>
    <li> Great brush!  It works well for taming my multiple cowlicks!!  I also have purchased the mini-version of this brush for travel so that I do not embarrass myself or our country.  However, odd looking hair styles seem to be in vogue.</li>
    <li> This is my second Denman brush...the first one lasted well over a decade.  Great design, very durable, easy to clean, and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, and has good weight to it.  So far so good, it detangles my natural, short, 4A hair that I have had for 2 months now.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love my denman! It works great in my hair. It completely detangles my hair but (at least with my hair) you have to work from ends to root. It take my a little bit to get my ends detangled. I also don&#x27;t use this brush too often because I did notice it can pull out some my hair if I used it too much. I usually only use it once or twice a month to really detangle it. You can also take out some of the teeth which is great. Mine has 4 rows instead of 7. I think this is a must have for naturals. In case anyone is curious, I have more of a 4a curl pattern with a mixture of course and fine hair.</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite hair brush. It&#x27;s effective and nice on the scalp. This is the same brush my father swears by as well. If you have thick hair, it works great. After some time the rubber part usually cracks, but that usually takes a couple years. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush in the past and I absolutely love it that&#x27;s why I ordered this particular Denman Brush.</li>
    <li> Great for thick, curly hair. Goes through hair with ease</li>
    <li> why i like the bush its soft to my hair and don&#x27;t hurt my scalp compare to other bushes pulling out my hair.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good brush for really curly hair but for my case my curls are too loose so it wasn&#x27;t the right brush for me but i&#x27;m positive that if you have really curly hair it will work great on you, it is also a great quality</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It has cut my detangling time on my hair down to a minimum. Best thing I could&#x27;ve bought this year. I highly recommend everyone to get one especially if you are a naturally curly girl like I am.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Makes detangling a breeze.</li>
    <li> Love this brush have used them for years</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the brush. I have been relaxer-free for 2 years and I often wondered about the hype of the Denman. Now, my only complaint is that I waited way too long! My 4b hair could have benefited from this brush a long time ago. I actually look forward to doing my hair, because it makes detangling a breeze. The Denman Brush is, by far, one of the only products(I literally have a entire beauty supply store in my house) that I&#x27;ve tried as a natural that lives up to its reputation. The next product I try will be bentonite clay. I can&#x27;t wait! Happy Brushing!!!</li>
    <li> I had read so much about Denman Brushes so I had to try it-it is for the person who would rather not detangle. I did not like it and prefer finger detangling- so... I am giving this away--all brushes are bad for your hair as they damage cuticles--even Denman brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome.  I have very thick natural hair and when I&#x27;m setting it, it smooths everything out perfectly!</li>
    <li> I was advised that the brush could be manipulated in order to decrease the number of rows of pins,  I have not been able to do so.</li>
    <li> The handle is small, which makes the brush slip out of my hand when detangling. Whenever I get my hair wet to detangle the bristles and the pink part slide out of the handle, which is a pain. I&#x27;m way too lazy to clean this all of the time, so I think I&#x27;m going to just give it to my mom. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, it&#x27;s quite expensive for a brush and doesn&#x27;t cover as much area as my trusty paddle brush. Difficult to use if hair is wet.</li>
    <li> LOVE! Why did I hesitate for so long before purchasing?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly What I expected</li>
    <li> It holds up well and does a great job of scalp massage and hair control Imagine my surprise at finding the same brush still available.</li>
    <li> Love how fast the item shipped. I am African American and in the process of transitioning to natural hair. I absolutely love how this brush detangles my hair. The hair just glides through the brush. But you have to start detangling from the end to the scalp. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have a big afro (4a type, very curly but tends to be dry) and since its become long, Ive had a hard time detangling it. Ive tried soaking my hair in conditioner and using a shower comb, then all these different types of wide toothed combs and they worked okay, but NOTHING like this Denman Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to section off a part of my hair and put some moisturizer on that section, then a little argan oil-- started from the bottom of the section, then slowly worked my way to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started noticing how my curls began &amp;#34;popping&amp;#34; and then I was able to go through my section as if my hair was STRAIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then twisted that section and did the same thing to each section in my hair. What I noticed is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Denman grabbed all of my shed hair. This has been as issue with me for a while since I started practicing &amp;#34;finger combing&amp;#34;. Lots of shed hair got tangles with the regular hair and I ended up with knots in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It didnt rip my hair. Again it grabbed all of my shed hair and I didnt hear my hair snapping like I would with a regular comb or a wig brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It distributed the product well through each section of hair. Honestly I havent seen my hair shine this much in a while and ALL my hair feels soft, and well moisturized because the Denman makes sure the products coats all of your strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as a side note-- i have a notoriously dry scalp that I developed small scabs on my head from scratching it like a madwoman. I have used the Denman on my hair and it seems that I released alot of shed/tangled hair because my scalp feels like it can BREATHE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please dont look any further if youre looking for a detangler-- THIS IS IT!!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! My hair is so much easier to detangle now. I&#x27;m glad I finally have one. Shipping was faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> My husband utilized this and loves it. I purchased it to keep him from placing suitcase on the bed. Now he uses the luggage rack which works a lot better.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and probably should have added this brush to my drawer a long time ago, but either way I am glad I did. It is great!</li>
    <li> Great de tangling and define curls</li>
    <li> I love this brush! A friend recommended it to me. She uses it for her hair and her daughter&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;m using it on my daughter. She no longer cries and complains when I&#x27;m styling her hair. Highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I had a brush similar to this one before and when my husband asked me about the purchase, I let him know what it was going to be used for and so on. I LOVE this brush and would recommend it to anyone with black type hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the detangling.  I guess I&#x27;m just more used to finger detangling.  I think this might work better for longer hair.  Mine is just shy of shoulder length.  Otherwise a good product.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve always used Denman and it&#x27;s never let us down!  This is a great brush that&#x27;s easy to clean and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd of this brush - over 12 years.  Seriously the best hairbrush ever.  Great for thick hair that tangles.</li>
    <li> Because it&#x27;s a good brush and I like it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good detangling brush.</li>
    <li> This brush makes evenly distributing product, detangling my hair and defining my curls so easy!&lt;br /&gt;Tip for anyone thinking about a Denman: this particular brush is best used when your hair is damp/wet.</li>
    <li> Great product my natural hair has not caused any bristles to fall out of this brush and it is very comfortable to use on my and my 3 daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping....it&#x27;s not for 4c/kinky hair. The brush is to soft.</li>
    <li> Just like picture but shipping took a while, other than that product is 100% good</li>
    <li> Item came sooner then told. Just as described, quality is great. Will order again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Works great on natural hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay brush not very sturdy for brushing wigs and all. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had never used a denim brush before, and was a little skeptical of the reviews that rated it well. I went on a whim and purchased it anyways, and am glad I did. This brush can enhance your curl pattern, and is best when used on damp hair. In the morning I take my spray bottle filled with water and wet my hair, using the brush afterwards to detangle. The material of the brush is good quality, and it&#x27;s very simple to clean, unlike boar bristle brushes.</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast and great brush!</li>
    <li> This brush works wonders :) leaves my curls FLAWLESS</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested I get this instead of a round brush because my hair is thick and strong. She said these brushes are made for my kind of hair and should be used instead of round brushes for blowdrying.  I trust her because she wasn&#x27;t trying to sell it to me and she&#x27;s generally very helpful.  The brush itself is nice and works well. I just wish it came with the hairdresser too.</li>
    <li> Brought it after hearing reviews about it. Not a good brush for my hair type. Bends when going through my hair an doesn&#x27;t set angle well and rips out hair when brushing. I have 4c hair.</li>
