      <li>I read a lot of reviews from many customers that have purchased this producted and just by looking at it</li>
      <li>Enjoying my product,thanks Amazon I will recommend to a friend.</li>

      <li>CHANGED MY MIND, GOOD PRODUCT, SLIGHT WARM FEELING, GIVES FULNESS TO BREASTS, GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>It was working for a while but after using another bottle, it wasn&#x27;t really as effective as it was the first time.</li>
      <li>but that is fine.</li>
      <li>It also tells you the best way to store it so that pretty much sold me:) When you open up the box there&#x27;s an elegant scent that kinda catches your attention</li>
      <li>its just a smell good moisturizer, do not see any results of what it claims to do thus far.</li>
      <li>it seems to work better when ur hot vs being in a cool area &amp;</li>
      <li>I grew a full cup size with 1 tube.</li>
      <li>This is a good product I am starting to see a difference&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>but it goes away fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>gonna add more info in a few weeks feeling good about this XD</li>
      <li>it makes my skin really soft, and im excited to see some results :)</li>
      <li>and I can already see the difference, definitely getting more!</li>
      <li>I have used it religiously for two weeks and saw an AMAZING... &amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Its burning my body for nothing I will continue to use because I noticed when I was hot and started sweating</li>
      <li>body temperature has to be hot</li>
      <li>First of all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first bottle...</li>
      <li>laid on a bed of hot coals) once i got used to that though its alright.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not TOO noticeable in a difference, but they ARE firmer and more perky which makes them LOOK bigger.</li>
      <li>; (so it actually feels more like you sat/</li>
      <li>so i cnt really rate the product yet..</li>
      <li>I put a quarter sized blob and I use that much on both my breasts and buns and BAM.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really see a difference after 3 weeks</li>
      <li>I really like this smell</li>
      <li>I give this produce 3 stars just for the fast shipment.</li>
      <li>I would make sure to wait awhile before feeding my baby after I applied it but would anything absorbed negatively affect my baby?</li>
      <li>I need more bottle to see the results;&lt;br /&gt;Of big boobs and big butts...</li>
      <li>Yet I have high hopes and i hope that this product is the answer to my boobs and bum</li>
      <li>and by the end of the week they(butt and breasts) are bigger by  one whole inch!!</li>
      <li>Tried the cream the first day I got it with no hot bath beforehand and felt nothing,but if applied after a hot bath the cream has a strong warming sensation almost alarming</li>
      <li>So far i like it.</li>
      <li>(Unless it really bleaches skin, turns hair blond &amp; makes your body grow by several inches</li>
      <li>Only been using a week once a day after a hot bath and have noticed firmness and lifting in the buttock area also some stretch mark plumping on inner thighs.</li>
      <li>and it actually came really quick than expected.</li>
      <li>Definitely would not waste money on this</li>
      <li>So far so good,using this to battle mother nature during middle age.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using the product and It makes my breasts itch and sting a little .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far so good,using this to battle mother nature during middle age.Only been using a week once a day after a hot bath and have noticed firmness and lifting in the buttock area also some stretch mark plumping on inner thighs.No improvement on breasts yet but that is fine.Tried the cream the first day I got it with no hot bath beforehand and felt nothing,but if applied after a hot bath the cream has a strong warming sensation almost alarming but it goes away fairly quickly.The cream also has a nice scent which is great not greasy at all and absorbs well no breakouts with this product either.</li>
    <li> It tingles haven&#x27;t seen no changes bottle almost gone</li>
    <li> So far i like it. My breast and butt feel firmer. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Has not helped me at all.</li>
    <li> Expired. One star because it arrived earlier than expected</li>
    <li> will this product work for actually make breasts grow, or will it just make you breasts appear larger?</li>
    <li> its just a smell good moisturizer, do not see any results of what it claims to do thus far.</li>
    <li> Came expired. Definitely listen to the reviews. Lame and waste of money</li>
    <li> using for about 3 weeks nothing has changed</li>
    <li> how long till i see results ????</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not TOO noticeable in a difference, but they ARE firmer and more perky which makes them LOOK bigger. Other than that, it didn&#x27;t change their size. Still 34B</li>
    <li> hate to say but I have used this product twice a day after shower, tube is finish and have not seen no difference, non at all</li>
    <li> I give this produce 3 stars just for the fast shipment. It came expired. Did not work! I don&#x27;t recommend this produce. It did not work for but for others maybe.</li>
    <li> This is a good product I am starting to see a difference&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> If you use this regularly ( morning and afternoon) every day after taking a bath you well start to feel it working in 2 -3 weeks time how well you know its working ?? You well know when your chest area or nipples start to became sore</li>
    <li> I got the must up to lift and firm my breast and bum i purchased two tubes one for my bum and one for my boobs I have used it religiously for two weeks and saw an AMAZING... &amp;#34; NOTHING &amp;#34; Yet I have high hopes and i hope that this product is the answer to my boobs and bum saddly i hasn&#x27;t showed me anything yet ...not even a small sign i was and still am very disappointed!! Its burning my body for nothing I will continue to use because I noticed when I was hot and started sweating it felt like they were tingling so maybe to get it too work youre body temperature has to be hot it seems to work better when ur hot vs being in a cool area &amp;#34;you may notice as a result a warm or hot body makes the product work better! Or faster!!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! I grew a full cup size with 1 tube.</li>
    <li> **********Have not purchased product so please ignore stars.********   Just wondering if any one has noticed the lady in the before &amp; after photos is not the same person? (Unless it really bleaches skin, turns hair blond &amp; makes your body grow by several inches but I could be wrong &#x3D;)  ).  Also just FYI for exp dates: most overseas products use a  yyyy/dd/mm format. so 2015/05/10 &#x3D; 10/05/2015.</li>
    <li> Can this be used for thighs too&lt;br /&gt;Plz reply. (:</li>
    <li> Took forever to come and it was expired</li>
    <li> First of all. It&#x27;s my first bottle... So, I cannot tell yet ... But I&#x27;m still using it... Plus I think !!!! I need more bottle to see the results;&lt;br /&gt;Of big boobs and big butts... Let see....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this !!! I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now &amp; I have seen changes .</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the product and It makes my breasts itch and sting a little . Hopefully it stops after I use it for a while</li>
    <li> I just got it so give me a second.</li>
    <li> Only been a few weeks and I can already see the difference, definitely getting more!</li>
    <li> CHANGED MY MIND, GOOD PRODUCT, SLIGHT WARM FEELING, GIVES FULNESS TO BREASTS, GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I just used the product so i cnt really rate the product yet..</li>
    <li> i havent been using this long enough to see results, but i can feel it working whenever i put it on. its a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; feeling like when the doc says youre gonna feel a &amp;#34;little pinch&amp;#34; (so it actually feels more like you sat/laid on a bed of hot coals) once i got used to that though its alright. it makes my skin really soft, and im excited to see some results :)</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me. But I&#x27;ve been using the cream for about 3 weeks or so now and I see absolutely no difference. The slight warmness or numbness...I don&#x27;t even get that. This cream was not worth it at all. Maybe other women will have a different result. Good Luck...</li>
    <li> Holly poop!! I have been only using this about a week and it works! I had read the other reviews before I bought it and I remember one person said that they used a little👌 more than the instructions ask for and it made it work for them so I did just that. I put a quarter sized blob and I use that much on both my breasts and buns and BAM. Day two firm, day 3 rounded and perky (still no cleavage but that&#x27;s just me) and by the end of the week they(butt and breasts) are bigger by  one whole inch!! Thank goodness!! And btw I am a real person who bought this and reviewing it because it&#x27;s that awesome!! 😊</li>
    <li> So my shipment came in 2 days befor it was suppoesed to and i put it on as soon as i got it and i deffinetly felt the burning and numbness and even a lil pain so im hoping it works gonna add more info in a few weeks feeling good about this XD</li>
    <li> I can feel the warm feeling come on 3-5 minutes after applying the product . I supposed that&#x27;s the product working . I haven&#x27;t seen results since this is my second day using it but I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars when I see results !!!</li>
    <li> Been using for 3 weeks now and have increased 1cup size,&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
    <li> Definitely would not waste money on this the pictures of the lady in the black bar are clearly from a plastic surgery before and after look at the hair cap smh . foolish no stars ........</li>
    <li> Is it safe to use while breastfeeding? I would make sure to wait awhile before feeding my baby after I applied it but would anything absorbed negatively affect my baby?</li>
    <li> Will this product work if you are losing weight?</li>
    <li> Just got this product and it actually came really quick than expected. I read a lot of reviews from many customers that have purchased this producted and just by looking at it I don&#x27;t see anything wrong. On the side of the box there is small print that states the name of the product and the suggested use which basically tells me the directions. It also tells you the best way to store it so that pretty much sold me:) When you open up the box there&#x27;s an elegant scent that kinda catches your attention but I&#x27;m telling you this from my point so It&#x27;s kinda what you think about the smell but to me I really like this smell so yea.... Many reports about this product show that it is &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; but my cream says that it expires 2015 05 10. I don&#x27;t quite understand why the creams have different expiration dates on them but I&#x27;m going to give this cream a try and hopefully I will recieve my expected results👍 Wish me luck</li>
    <li> Starting to see results after second tube</li>
    <li> it does not work, bought two bottles and still the same size. Maybe I need to use the pills</li>
    <li> It was working for a while but after using another bottle, it wasn&#x27;t really as effective as it was the first time.</li>
    <li> Enjoying my product,thanks Amazon I will recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This product does NOT WORK . company also sent me this product and it was expired . Highly disappointed .</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:f8ceb164eea750ac4ebdefbe1c735650]]i bought two and i dont know if the product is already expired.. there&#x27;s a date \\&quot;2014 12 10\\&quot;. i want to know if its still safe to use or not..</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work......</li>
    <li> Took forever to receive and it was 2 months expired. Too bad i Realized after applying it, my breast burned a little.</li>
    <li> Just got it in today used it ones not feeling at all great smell will let you know how it goes been two weeks now nothing yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and I can already tell the difference on my legs it&#x27;s awesome</li>

</ol>
