      <li>The benefit here is not as noticeable, but it does keep the trimmer clean and smelling fresh.  </li>
      <li>The product works and it seems to have more lubricant than my older cans</li>
      <li>Just a quick push on the nozzle.</li>
      <li>Give the heads a quick blast of Shaver Saver and turn the shaver on.  </li>
      <li>I love my Braun electric shaver, but I don&#x27;t particularly like buying replacement cutters and foils for it.  </li>
      <li>Quick squirt through the shaver foil as it is running</li>
      <li>I have also been very consistent about changing the cleaning cartridge out of the system every month.  </li>
      <li>I have also been very consistent about changing the cleaning cartridge out of the system every month.  </li>
      <li>The alcohol in Shaver Saver cleans face oils that your whiskers leave on the cutters, though you should clean the cutter pretty well before using it.  </li>
      <li>Given the price of the thing, I started looking for some kind of lubricant so it will last longer.  </li>
      <li>Came quickly and was exactly as promised</li>
      <li>but it dissipates pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t run out right away.</li>
      <li>Excellent razor lube at a price less than I would pay locally.</li>
      <li>Some people simply use alcohol with a tooth brush to clean the cutters and spray them with WD-40...it does the job but to me the smell of WD-40 is pretty strong, especially near my face.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says on the tin.</li>
      <li>My first Remington foil began self-destructing within 4 months.  </li>
      <li>, a new full can is under a lot of pressure.  </li>
      <li>but you certainly don&#x27;t want it on your face.</li>
      <li>much easier than using the brush that comes with the shaver and hair clipper.</li>
      <li>and they don&#x27;t wear out as fast</li>
      <li>SP4 Lubricant is the real deal, if you don&#x27;t mind the smell.  </li>
      <li>It works well and the delivery has always been very prompt.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Panasonic shavers are designed to move the blades much faster than most other brands.  </li>
      <li>it leaves them clean and lubricated; ready for the next use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a pretty cheap guy but a few dollars a can is worth it to me for a product that works well on Brauns, Remingtons, and I suppose Norelcos since those parts wear as well.  </li>
      <li>Over three years of almost daily use, on the original foil and set of blades.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great--it keeps your shaver cutters and heads clean and lubricated, which means they will last longer before needing replacement.  </li>
      <li>it does a good job they last longer now less friction on the blades</li>
      <li>As expected, this product is performing very well and is meeting my needs and expectations very adequately.</li>
      <li>The cutters also move slightly faster and cut better when the cutter heads and foil are well lubricated.  </li>
      <li>I have tried this on an older Norelco Quadra, and the increase in speed is noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I have tried this on an older Norelco Quadra, and the increase in speed is noticeable.  </li>

      <li>highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>The rotary shavers tend to be a little bit more</li>
      <li>Most of the stuff I looked at was little more than high-priced alcohol, with little or no lubricant in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The rotary shavers tend to be a little bit more</li>
      <li>When I first started using Remington shavers, I thought the Shaver Saver was just an extra expense.  </li>
      <li>Keeps your razor sharp and clean.</li>
      <li>This product keeps my shaver/hair trimmer clean and sharp.</li>
      <li>I do feel that constant use of the product has a positive effect on the life of the razor.</li>
      <li>I use electric foil head shavers--many different brands over the years, but mostly Remingtons-and the secret to long foil life is keeping it clean and lubricated.  </li>
      <li>After reading a lot of reviews for electric shavers, I finally decided on one of the new panasonic models to replace my Braun.  </li>
      <li>My Dad will have me send no other then Remington shaver saver.  </li>
      <li>Hold it away from your face when you use it the first few times.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the small extra expense.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but 2 times but I know from past experience it will extend the life of my shaver. An excellent product I highly recommend. Also I didn&#x27;t notice any unpleasant oily odor.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product on line numerous times. It works well and the delivery has always been very prompt.</li>
    <li> I had been using Thompson&#x27;s Electric shave (or something like it)...then bought this because could not find my favorite on Amazon. SP4 is a spray- on oil---think WD40 only an aerosol version. To my nose, smells like machine oil, might be good for the shaver but you certainly don&#x27;t want it on your face.I think I&#x27;ll move it out to the garage for light duty oiling applications.</li>
    <li> When I first started using Remington shavers, I thought the Shaver Saver was just an extra expense.  My first Remington foil began self-destructing within 4 months.  Since then I have used Shaver Saver, which prolongs the life of the foil to an average of 2+ years.  Shaver Saver also helps the shaver stay up to speed when the battery is getting low.  Well worth the small extra expense.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my shaver/hair trimmer clean and sharp. I believe it extends the life of my shaver and saves me money.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and was exactly as promised</li>
    <li> A reliable, easy to apply lubricant without the tell-tale smell of WD-40.   Works well on my shaver and applies easily and dries quickly.  I&#x27;d buy  it again.</li>
    <li> I use it after every shave. Keeps my razor running &amp; the heads sharp. I might use it as a lubricant on other items</li>
    <li> I have been using the Shaver Saver cleaner for a ling tine and they are hard to find thanks for keeping these on hand</li>
    <li> Remington&#x27;s \\&quot;Shaver Saver\\&quot; is the best product I have used for cleaning, lubricating, and extending the sharpness of my Norelco rotating cutter blades.  After 50 years of electric shavers and shaves, I had on idea how close an electric shaver could shave my daily beard growth.  I will continue to buy and use Shaver Saver as long as it&#x27;s produced and sold by AMAZON since this is where I discovered it. Let me add that I hope it&#x27;s made in AMERICA.  Floyd Lathbury  5367 Creek View Lane   Hollywood, SC 29449</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used electric razors! So, this spray is the best and indispensable! Recomended to relatives and friends! Enrique Rovero.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun Series 370 Shaver. I have used Phillips Norelco HQ110 Shaving Head Cleaning Spray since I bought it and then ran out. I purchased this Remington Shaver Saver Lubricant and I can&#x27;t get past the petroleum smell. The Norelco spray has a nice lemon scent to it and it works fine. You can hear the razor speed up when you spray it on the head while running. I would not recommend the Remington SP4. I would highly recommend the Norelco HQ110 which I am going to get to replace the Remington SP4.</li>
    <li> The spray is easy to apply. Just a quick push on the nozzle. Reduces  irritation. Nice scent and not a perfume. A can lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Electric shavers need care too.  There is metal to metal contact when the cutting blades rotate or slide, depending on your shaver type.  This product cleans when you spray it on and lubricates without leaving an oily mess behind.  Personally I like the aroma but it dissipates pretty quickly.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years now.</li>
    <li> My husband has several electric shaves and this product works well on them.  Having two cans is helpful as he uses this product regularly.  Won&#x27;t run out right away.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t find a better product. It cleans and lubricates the shaver head with just a spray, all in one operation.</li>
    <li> tHIS ISNOT A BOOK  BUT AN _______ORDER!</li>
    <li> I got this to prolong the life of my shaver heads it does a good job they last longer now less friction on the blades and they don&#x27;t wear out as fast</li>
    <li> Makes the shaver run a little faster due to less friction, and makes the heads last a lot longer.  Cans are smaller than I thought, but last a long time.  I get about 7 months of use per can, using it every day.  Quick squirt through the shaver foil as it is running (after brushing the head out).  You can hear the shaver speed increase.</li>
    <li> My Dad will have me send no other then Remington shaver saver.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent lubricant for rotary razors. Works especially well with Norelco (Philips) shavers. It will triple the life of the heads.</li>
    <li> I love my Braun electric shaver, but I don&#x27;t particularly like buying replacement cutters and foils for it.  This stuff is great--it keeps your shaver cutters and heads clean and lubricated, which means they will last longer before needing replacement.  You can tell it works every time you use it.  Give the heads a quick blast of Shaver Saver and turn the shaver on.  You&#x27;ll hear the shaver pick up speed as the cleaner and lube spreads around the cutters and heads.  You&#x27;ll get more shaves per charge as well.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Excellent lubrication and cleaner of all cordless shavers of all manufacturers.  WIll buy agin if I need more.  The two cans will last for years.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor lube at a price less than I would pay locally. Each can lasts a long time when used as directed.</li>
    <li> Product received on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> works great, keeps shaver clean and in good condition.  extends the life of the shaver.  would reccommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> If you own an electric razor this product works as advertised. Keeps your razor sharp and clean.</li>
    <li> The product works well in lubricating the blades, making the shave less traumatic as well as preserving the life of the shaver head.</li>
    <li> I think these will last a long time, as it takes only a spritz on the shaver head to actually hear the lube working.  The shaver runs faster and better.  Good product.  I used this in the past, got away from electric razors, and then got another one and added a couple cans of this spray cleaner to care for the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
    <li> It was what we expected.  My husband has had a hard time finding this in the stores and he was especially happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> The product works and it seems to have more lubricant than my older cans but I don&#x27;t care for the oil like smell when I shave.  The older unit had a nicer orange type smell that was definately more pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> I use electric foil head shavers--many different brands over the years, but mostly Remingtons-and the secret to long foil life is keeping it clean and lubricated.  This product, applied once a week, will greatly lengthen the time between replacement of foils, and save you money.  It will work on ANY brand of shaver where you have cutter/head contact.  In order to get a close shave, the foil (or head) has to be very, very thin and so the slightest friction can wear a hole quickly.  The cutters also move slightly faster and cut better when the cutter heads and foil are well lubricated.  Hard to find these spray cans in stores, so I have been ordering them on line here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> The best product for cleaning and lubricating shaver cutters and heads.  I&#x27;ve used for 30 years, still buy it locally of order from Amazon.  The alcohol in Shaver Saver cleans face oils that your whiskers leave on the cutters, though you should clean the cutter pretty well before using it.  The oil lubricates the blades for longer life.  I&#x27;m a pretty cheap guy but a few dollars a can is worth it to me for a product that works well on Brauns, Remingtons, and I suppose Norelcos since those parts wear as well.  Some people simply use alcohol with a tooth brush to clean the cutters and spray them with WD-40...it does the job but to me the smell of WD-40 is pretty strong, especially near my face.  I don&#x27;t recommend using Shaver Saver after every shave; that&#x27;s overkill which of course Remington prefers you doing as they can sell more.  Lubricating once a week is plenty.</li>
    <li> I have used this Remington product for more than 40 years and two Shavers. I do feel that constant use of the product has a positive effect on the life of the razor.</li>
    <li> excellent service &amp; a great product</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x60;ve been using this spray for about 3 months now. It does exactly what it says on the tin.</li>
    <li> The spray blows the hair clippings out of my shaver and my hair clipper.  it leaves them clean and lubricated; ready for the next use.  Great product.  much easier than using the brush that comes with the shaver and hair clipper.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver cleaner and oil stay pm the market  have been using it for many years</li>
    <li> As expected, this product is performing very well and is meeting my needs and expectations very adequately. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> My current electric razor is a Panasonic 8109S.  This razor came with its own automatic cleaning system.  I have been using this razor for over 3 years.  You can still find my review of that from 2009, here at Amazon.  The amazing thing about this razor is that I have yet to change the foil and the blades!  That&#x27;s right!  Over three years of almost daily use, on the original foil and set of blades.  I attribute this longevity to the fact that I use this Remington Shaver Saver each and every time.  Ofcourse, the automatic cleaning system must also be given due credit for its contribution to prolonging component life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have used both rotary and foil shavers.  The foils tend to shave closer and they also tend to be easier to maneuver around your face.  Their Achilles&#x27; Heel, however, is that the foil is a delicate component of the apparatus.  You see, in order to get the closest possible shave, the foil itself has to be as thin as possible.  That is the reason why they normally do not last very long.  The inner blades move from side to side, maintaining contact with the foil.  As the hair enters the openings in the foil, the blades move across, trimming the hair.  All shavers will pull from time to time.  But the faster the blades are moving, the less likely that it will pull.  This Remington Shaver Saver works by lubricating the foil and the blades.  You will actually notice a slight increase in perceived blade speed.  The lubrication also helps to prolong the life of the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic shavers are designed to move the blades much faster than most other brands.  They build them this way to increase user comfort.  But, if the razor is not cleaned and lubricated regularly, that same design can also mean a shorter life for the foil and the inner blades.  And this is why it is advantageous to have an automatic cleaning system.  The cleaning base uses replaceable cleaning cartridges.  The cleaning cartridge contains a sponge filter, detergent, and lubricant.  The system does a very good job of cleaning, charging, and drying the razor.  But, the lubricant that it leaves behind is not as good as the thin lubricant in the Shaver Saver.  I spray the razor foil every morning, before using the shaver.  So far, so good.  I have also been very consistent about changing the cleaning cartridge out of the system every month.  I have a subscription with Amazon, whereby they send me a pack of cleaning cartridges every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this Shaver Saver on my Norelco trimmer.  The benefit here is not as noticeable, but it does keep the trimmer clean and smelling fresh.  I have tried this on an older Norelco Quadra, and the increase in speed is noticeable.  You can use this for just about any electric razor out there.  However, in my humble opinion, the shaver type that really benefits from this is the delicate foil razor.  The rotary shavers tend to be a little bit more robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  It is flammable, so please be mindful of your surroundings when spraying.  You will also want to keep it away from children because of this.etergent, and lubricant.  The system does a very good job of cleaning, charging, and drying the razor.

    <li> Smells awful. Norelco&#x27;s product works better and has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of reviews for electric shavers, I finally decided on one of the new panasonic models to replace my Braun.  Given the price of the thing, I started looking for some kind of lubricant so it will last longer.  Most of the stuff I looked at was little more than high-priced alcohol, with little or no lubricant in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SP4 Lubricant is the real deal, if you don&#x27;t mind the smell.  It smells like something you would spray into the carburetor of your 68 Camaro to get it started on a cold day.  But then again, if it smelled like peaches and cream it probably wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a new full can is under a lot of pressure.  Hold it away from your face when you use it the first few times.  After that, the pressure will be less and you won&#x27;t get the blow back.</li>
