      <li>This product smells great without having too strong of a &#x27;tanning&#x27; lotion scent.  </li>
      <li>Will not use anything else, honestly it works.</li>
      <li>I have used many indoor tanning lotions before and did not find one that was exceptional until Bella.  </li>
      <li>I must say that I have tried a lot of lotions and this by far the best, I love how I can see color after laying, I also love love how the smell don&#x27;t smell like burn skin after laying as well.....</li>

      <li>Simply fantastic!</li>
      <li>Love this lotion.</li>
      <li>funciono de maravilla y un buen envió me llego en dos días después del pedido ok</li>
      <li>I love the smell, and so has everyone else.</li>
      <li>After reading many of the reviews on this product, I bought it.</li>
      <li>Also, I am not any more tan than I was before.  </li>
      <li>use this product again. :)</li>
      <li>and he always hates the way I smell after tanning. :-)</li>
      <li>I LOVE most of the lotions I buy..</li>
      <li>This is simply the best tanning lotion I have used.</li>
      <li>There is nothing better than this product, from what I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried hundreds.</li>
      <li>The bronzers in this lotion were more of a blackish/brown which worked perfectly with my skin to counter the red that comes out every time I tan.</li>
      <li>My skin has never felt so healthy and hydrated.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I bought the product as I didn&#x27;t experience any issues.</li>
      <li>I do recommend :)</li>
      <li>Everything seemed to go great, though it didn&#x27;t seem I got much of a \\&quot;boost\\&quot; from the lotion.</li>
      <li>I WOULD GLADLY PAY</li>
      <li>Glad they were true.  </li>
      <li>BECAUSE OF THE FANTASTIC RESULTS I WOULD GET FROM MY TANNING SALON WITH IT.  </li>
      <li>&quot; is if I apply way too much lotion by accident or if I&#x27;m tanning in a bed that does not have good ventilation resulting in my body getting really hot and sweaty</li>
      <li>very fast shipping though :)</li>
      <li>i was so excited to try this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ultra rich moisturizers and silicone emollients make my skin super smooth.</li>
      <li>I have tried a bunch of different tanning lotions here on Amazon, but this is by far the best...</li>
      <li>It smells really nice and gives you a very natural tan.</li>
      <li>Today, I can barley sit here and type this, I literally feel as if I have a full body sunburn, and I look that way too.</li>
      <li>If you rub the lotion in good enough, that won&#x27;t happen.  </li>
      <li>I have used a variety of tanning lotions and Bella Black provided the absolute darkest, most believable tan, and overall best color!</li>
      <li>I am VERY pleased with the results and will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
      <li>My skin is fair and I definitely got some color my first tan.  </li>
      <li>I used it ONE time, on the max allowed in the lowest bed in the tanning salon, and I turned 2-3 shades darker on the first time!  </li>
      <li>i used the entire bottle and was wanting more!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other lotions, and I think this might be my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I love everything about it, such a smooth consistent tan.</li>
      <li>Packed with effective bronzers I can ensure my glow stay golden all year long!  </li>
      <li>this lotion gave me tanning results immediately--the only reason that i did not order more is because i wanted to try others</li>
      <li>When you use it the first time you can tell a difference.</li>
      <li>I guess there is a first for everything, though..  </li>
      <li>This lotion has a firming formula that really smoothes and firms your skin!</li>
      <li>not only does she love it..</li>
      <li>I bought a sample pack at the local tanning salon for my session yesterday (just went on her recommendation and should have known better).</li>
      <li>Up till now I&#x27;ve only been able to get it in salons.</li>
      <li>so naturally I was excited to get it.  </li>
      <li>Not so much.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It is very sticky - the bottle mentions that you can use it as a tan extender in addition to using it as a tanning lotion...</li>
      <li>but the smell is very neutral, and we can both use it..</li>
      <li>The smell is light and the lotion feels soft and stays soft.</li>
      <li>It also prevents much of the &#x27;after tanning&#x27; scent that many other lotions tend to give off after tanning.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s older product or something, but I found it very sticky and slimy.</li>
      <li>-- it did not leave me streaky--the smell was the only slight problem i had with this lotion (not too good after tanning)</li>
      <li>at first thought this was amazing, but after using it for about a week i noticed that i looked dark almost instantly however when id shower at night</li>
      <li>Flash forward to 6 hours later, my skin on every part of my body the lotion was used on is inflamed, sensitive, and bright pink.</li>
      <li>I have used just about every lotion out there and just found my new fave!  </li>
      <li>I naturally have very fair skin and find it difficult to both get and keep my tan.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It also leaves a great bronze color without looking fake or overdone.</li>
      <li>I purchased Bella Black last week and it helped me to get a really nice tan.</li>
      <li>I looked very naturally bronzed</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely not an intolerable \\&quot;after tan smell\\&quot; in comparison to many other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>4 hours later, my entire face is red, parts are swollen, and my legs are becoming sensitive.</li>
      <li>In fact, I&#x27;m changing from the old premium brand I used to use.</li>
      <li>was pleasantly surprised when I tried the lotion.  </li>
      <li>and I urge others who have sensitive skin (even those who tan often) to avoid it as well.</li>
      <li>I am super picky when it comes to my lotions but Bella Black has completely exceeded all of my expectations.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to try different lotions; however, to date, Bella Black remains my favorite with Paint it Black as a close second and good alternative if you are looking to spend a little less.</li>
      <li>Did I mention that I do not have sensitive skin and have NEVER had an allergic reaction to any lotion in my entire life?  </li>
      <li>if your looking for a lotion that will get you dark fast</li>
      <li>it pretty much completely washed off leaving me with little to no tan!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lotion didn&#x27;t help me with my tan at all.  The smell was weird and cost to much for not working</li>
    <li> I am super picky when it comes to my lotions but Bella Black has completely exceeded all of my expectations.  It&#x27;s ultra rich moisturizers and silicone emollients make my skin super smooth. I use this daily, even if I don&#x27;t hit the salon and it has replaced my usual body lotion. Packed with effective bronzers I can ensure my glow stay golden all year long!  I will continue to recommend Bella Black to all of my friends! xxoo</li>
    <li> I had heard great things about this stuff.  Glad they were true.  It is Terrific!  I look and feel great with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I recieved it in the mail on Wednesday and I tried it out today, Friday in a stand up bed. It was really really good. It is the best I&#x27;ve used yet. I love the smell, and so has everyone else. It smells like bubblegum to me. When you use it the first time you can tell a difference. I will deff. use this product again. :)</li>
    <li> This is simply the best tanning lotion I have used. I love everything about it, such a smooth consistent tan. My skin has never felt so healthy and hydrated. Once you use it you won&#x27;t use anything else. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The quality of the lotion is just not that great. Maybe it&#x27;s older product or something, but I found it very sticky and slimy. When I took a shower that night some of the lotion was still washing off on my hands, leaving uneven tan marks on my skin. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my gf for her Birthday... now.. myself.. I have tried a bunch of different tanning lotions here on Amazon, but this is by far the best...not only does she love it.. but I was at a plateau with my tan, and once I used Bella Black for a week... (3 salon visits, 10 minutes each) I definitely noticed a difference.. I was skeptical about the pink text bottle.. but the smell is very neutral, and we can both use it.. I will be buying another bottle for her for X-mas!</li>
    <li> I used it ONE time, on the max allowed in the lowest bed in the tanning salon, and I turned 2-3 shades darker on the first time!  I even got a little crispy, and I NEVER burn!  This lotion is great!  Go easy on the minutes if you dont have a base yet, you&#x27;ll burn for sure!  Love this lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells wonderful and has given me a beautiful tan. I am VERY pleased with the results and will definitely be buying this product again! The only time I ever get the \\&quot;after tan smell\\&quot; is if I apply way too much lotion by accident or if I&#x27;m tanning in a bed that does not have good ventilation resulting in my body getting really hot and sweaty (Ugh...). It&#x27;s definitely not an intolerable \\&quot;after tan smell\\&quot; in comparison to many other lotions I&#x27;ve used. My husband has even commented on how great it smells and he always hates the way I smell after tanning. :-)</li>
    <li> This lotion has a firming formula that really smoothes and firms your skin! It smells really nice and gives you a very natural tan. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My cousin let me know he found this product on Amazon. Up till now I&#x27;ve only been able to get it in salons. I&#x27;m planning on stocking up for my use and for xmas gifts since its cheaper here. Bella Black Bronzer has always got the job done for me!</li>
    <li> I just started tanning a little last year and I wanted quicker results because I was tannig for a Prom fashion show.  After a lot of looking around and having no idea what type of lotion to purchase, I decided on Bella Black.  I never burned, it doesn&#x27;t have a nasty, tanning smell.  It smells rather relaxing to me.  AND I got wonderful results.  I didn&#x27;t look orange or over-tanned.  I looked very naturally bronzed and I loved it!  I do recommend :)</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviewer that reported uneven tanning. I tried this lotion on three different occasions with the same result; uneven tanning and little to no bronzing. Disappointment for the cost.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this lotion on eBay about a month ago. I have used a variety of tanning lotions and Bella Black provided the absolute darkest, most believable tan, and overall best color! I naturally have very fair skin and find it difficult to both get and keep my tan. The bronzers in this lotion were more of a blackish/brown which worked perfectly with my skin to counter the red that comes out every time I tan. The smell is light and the lotion feels soft and stays soft. As with all lotions that contain a bronzer it&#x27;s best to wait to shower afterward and allow the bronzers to continue working. I look dark immediately after tanning and noticeably darker within a few hours! I will continue to try different lotions; however, to date, Bella Black remains my favorite with Paint it Black as a close second and good alternative if you are looking to spend a little less.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion based on all the great reviews... so naturally I was excited to get it.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  I LOVE most of the lotions I buy.. but this one?  Not so much.  It is very sticky - the bottle mentions that you can use it as a tan extender in addition to using it as a tanning lotion... but all it did was make me sticky and made my skin break out in a nasty rash.  Also, I am not any more tan than I was before.  Had to stop using it because of the rash.  Did I mention that I do not have sensitive skin and have NEVER had an allergic reaction to any lotion in my entire life?  I guess there is a first for everything, though..  All I can say is.. Boo on this product! :(</li>
    <li> I have used many indoor tanning lotions before and did not find one that was exceptional until Bella.  My legs would not get any darker but after using this for 1 week I was visably 2 shades darker.  Love this product!!!!  Will not use anything else, honestly it works.</li>
    <li> I purchased Bella Black last week and it helped me to get a really nice tan. I had misgivings because of a comment I saw but I&#x27;m glad I bought the product as I didn&#x27;t experience any issues. In fact, I&#x27;m changing from the old premium brand I used to use.</li>
    <li> at first thought this was amazing, but after using it for about a week i noticed that i looked dark almost instantly however when id shower at night it pretty much completely washed off leaving me with little to no tan!! after a week of this happening i knew it had to be the lotion seeing its never happened to me before with anyother lotion, and ive been tanning for a looong time i was so excited to try this cuz of so many great reviews but this product is defanitly not for me. very fast shipping though :)</li>
    <li> I must say that I have tried a lot of lotions and this by far the best, I love how I can see color after laying, I also love love how the smell don&#x27;t smell like burn skin after laying as well.....if your looking for a lotion that will get you dark fast this one is perfect</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion no orange at am a frequent tan aholic lol and would use Bella for ever great moisture and awesome color and smell great..a little like grapes I think.</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves the skin soft and silky without the nasty after tanning smell I definitely recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> this lotion is incredible. it gets me very dark without the tanning bed smell.  I would recommend this to all my friends.  Love this lotion!</li>
    <li> I have used just about every lotion out there and just found my new fave!  Best bang for the buck and did i mention a killer tan? I feel like a bronze god.</li>
    <li> I have a great base tan and was looking for something that would get me over that tanning hump so to speak. After reading many of the reviews on this product, I bought it. Total waste of my cash. Can anyone suggest a tanning product that actually works on tan people?</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous other tanning products, but this one blows the competition out of the water. There is nothing better than this product, from what I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried hundreds. Simply fantastic!</li>
    <li> I WAS SEARCHING AND SEARCHING FOR THIS LOTION BECAUSE OF THE FANTASTIC RESULTS I WOULD GET FROM MY TANNING SALON WITH IT.  IN THE SALON THEY WERE CHARGING ME $10 FOR A TINY CUP OF IT, BUT I WOULD GLADLY PAY BECAUSE IT MADE EACH TAN LAST LIKE FIVE TIMES LONGER AND WOULD SAVE ME MONEY.  IT CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE I FOUND IT HERE AT THIS INCREDIBLE PRICE.  THIS LOTION WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT TANNING AND WHAT TANNING CAN DO FOR YOU.  IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS THAT DON&#x27;T THINK TANNING WORKS, HAVE THEM TRY IT WITH THIS LOTION AND I GUARANTEE THEY WILL BE REGULAR TANNERS!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant on buying this.  I read some of reviews and saw complaints.  There were a couple reviews stating that their skin was blotchy.  If you rub the lotion in good enough, that won&#x27;t happen.  I suppose everyone has different skin and it reacts differently.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when I tried the lotion.  My skin is fair and I definitely got some color my first tan.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all, I actually love it.  This lotion is awesome.  I&#x27;ve tried so many other lotions, and I think this might be my favorite.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> i used the entire bottle and was wanting more! this lotion gave me tanning results immediately--the only reason that i did not order more is because i wanted to try others -- it did not leave me streaky--the smell was the only slight problem i had with this lotion (not too good after tanning) the bronzers worked well for me! rub it in good!</li>
    <li> This product smells great without having too strong of a &#x27;tanning&#x27; lotion scent.  It also prevents much of the &#x27;after tanning&#x27; scent that many other lotions tend to give off after tanning.  It also leaves a great bronze color without looking fake or overdone.</li>
    <li> Great lotion,smells wonderful! I&#x27;m starting to darking up after only 5 times in the tanning bed, that&#x27;s only 50 minutes for me.</li>
    <li> I bought a sample pack at the local tanning salon for my session yesterday (just went on her recommendation and should have known better). Did a 15-20 minute session like I do every 6 months. Everything seemed to go great, though it didn&#x27;t seem I got much of a \\&quot;boost\\&quot; from the lotion. Went home, did my thing. 3 hours later my skin on my face begins to turn blotchy and red. 4 hours later, my entire face is red, parts are swollen, and my legs are becoming sensitive. Flash forward to 6 hours later, my skin on every part of my body the lotion was used on is inflamed, sensitive, and bright pink. Today, I can barley sit here and type this, I literally feel as if I have a full body sunburn, and I look that way too. I have narrowed the cause down to the lotion given that I have frequented the tanning salon multiple times and have never had this reaction, have done the same thing every 6 months and by no means should have had this reaction otherwise, have no food allergies, and nothing new has been introduced to my home environment. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be using this product again and I urge others who have sensitive skin (even those who tan often) to avoid it as well.</li>
