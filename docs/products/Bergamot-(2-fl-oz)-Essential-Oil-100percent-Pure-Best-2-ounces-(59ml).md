      <li>It would be throwing good money after bad to pay to send it back, so that&#x27;s $14.00 in the trash.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This oil is well worth the price.  It has a citrus aroma that is like rich limes.  Smells heavenly!!  I purchased this product at a reduced cost.</li>
    <li> Good product. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Leaves oily sticky residue on hands, neck, and hair. not to be used in a perfume sort of way. Scent dissipates after around 30 seconds. Other brands work just fine for this application. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I used this in an essential oil burner.  It heated up and smelled like wax.  That&#x27;s the only smell it had.  I kept it heating for about half an hour.  The oil turned into a fatty waxy white substance that smelled exactly like it looked.  The oil in the bottle has a faint citrus smell.  Nothing like the fragrance of true bergamot essential oil.  Extremely disappointed, I will not purchase any more Sun Organic essential oils.  It would be throwing good money after bad to pay to send it back, so that&#x27;s $14.00 in the trash.</li>
    <li> First I did receive a promotional discount to review and post my honest opinion.  I love these oils!  The Bergamotis amazing and makes me want a nice cup of tea. The only way they could improve is by putting a dropper in the bottle but they now include these little plastic thingies (that I&#x27;m sure have a proper name) and that&#x27;s a step in the right direction. I&#x27;m sure by adding a dropper though that would drastically increase their prices.  Also very quick delivery.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have never used Bergamot Essential Oil before and have never actually heard of it until I came across this listing so I did a little research to find out what it&#x27;s benefits are for and how I could use it once I received it. Here is a couple uses I found...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Added to water for an aromatic bath to help reduce stress&lt;br /&gt;*Inhaled for an instant boost of positivity&lt;br /&gt;*Applied topically to soothe insect bites&lt;br /&gt;*Used with chamomile and fennel essential oil to massage your abdominal area for treatment of gas, indigestion, and flatulence&lt;br /&gt;*Mixed with lavender, salt, and filtered water as a genital wash to prevent UTI recurrence&lt;br /&gt;***There are much more usages with this Bergamot Essential Oil this is just a couple that I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used this Bergamot Essential Oil in my diffuser to see if it would help with stress and be relaxing. The smell is very calming and did indeed decrease my stress level and made me relax. I also used it when my fiance grilled outside and I got bit by a couple mosquitoes and it took the sting and itch out almost immediately. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or leave any residue as it absorbs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Bergamot Essential Oil comes in a 2oz bottle that will definitely last me quite awhile and comes with a plastic dropper to help with getting the accurate amount of drops without wasting any which saves you money! I would definitely recommend this Bergamot Essential Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> This eo is great. I add it to my homemade deodorant.</li>
    <li> Professionally relieved and what I expected.</li>
    <li> This smells super amazing! Good to use in soap or little in laundry detergent! Can be use in oil diffuser, it has pleasant smell, works great!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product in exchange of review!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Excellent...on-time delivery...perfect!</li>
    <li> The lid was loose during shipping and it leaked about a 1/2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that everything was good.</li>
    <li> A rather weak bergamot scent.</li>
    <li> oooh smells so goood!</li>
    <li> fantastic product and speedy service.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping have been back many times! Great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Do not purchase.  Terrible. Made a scummy film all over the bathroom mirrors from diffusing.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and mixed with other oils and lotions, makes a very nice moisturizer. This is my 2nd purchase as I used up all of the 1st rather quickly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this particular oil. I was lucky enough to win it in a giveaway for a review. It is a mellow citrus like aroma that flows through my entire house. It works great for deodorizing the house. especially when cooking. I will definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> The oil itself smells great, so I have no problem with the product. The packaging however leaves much room for improvement. As stated by other reviewers, you should be prepared to receive only 3/4 of the content you payed for. The rest will be leaked out onto the bubble wrap. Quite strange, because the top seems to be screwed on tightly.</li>
    <li> If you have never purchased an essential oil before, then you have no idea how intense the fragrance CAN and SHOULD be. I have gotten several from this company and none were very potent. I cannot imagine how weak this would be after diluting it with a carrier oil. The price is low in comparison to my favorite. You get what pay for.</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars as bottle does not state where it was manufactured.  Do Not take internally, read the bottle.  Always read up up on safety warnings when using any oils.  I love the citrus aroma this gives off.  Great smell though not strong.  I have included some uses for this oil but you can find more online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne&lt;br /&gt;Try a dab over the blemish, but be careful of exposure to sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addictions&lt;br /&gt;Apply one drop of bergamot oil to the feet and one drop over the solar plexus 1-2 times a day in conjunction with inner work.

    <li> This arrived with 1/5 of the contents leaking all over the box and the other merchandise in the box.  The scent was quite mild - my bergamot tea has a stronger scent.</li>
    <li> I received this to review and love it. It smells great and i find new uses for it everyday. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this free to try and although I haven&#x27;t found many uses for it I can tell you it is a high quality oil with a very reasonable price tag.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly. Safety seal was intact. Very aromatic and pleasant, great flavor added to my tea.</li>
    <li> Had never heard of the scent before but gave it a try anyways. This household is not a fan of it at all but my sister happened to visit and could not get enough of it so she walked away from here with a free bottle of oil. She has since called and thanked me because her husband loves it to. Too each their own at least someone gets good use out of it.</li>
    <li> Good smell and fast delivery, thanks</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great price.</li>
    <li> arrived as promised - was as described - sealed bottle that was packaged with care</li>
    <li> very nice strong smell</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent Bergamot but it&#x27;s not organic or Therapeutic grade, so don&#x27;t use it thinking as such.</li>
    <li> Great item, great brand,and great delivery!</li>
    <li> This oil is really great! It smells amazing! Not too strong, which I like. I put some on my temples when I had a headache and it took me into a deep relaxation. When I am achy after running, I put a few drops in my bath and it helps my sore feet. I sleep like a baby after my baths! I would definitely recommend this for pain and relaxation and I&#x27;m sure there are many other ways to use! I will be purchasing this! I received oil to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Good clean product!  Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> The oil is fine but after I mix it with other oil to make perfume I cant smell the bergamot so maybe I need to try another brand to see which one is better.</li>
    <li> Just what we wanted, thanks!</li>
    <li> Use organic bergamot as part of ingredients for home made poo pourie. It appears to work great.</li>
    <li> Sun Essentials Oil Bergamot has a very calming and relaxing aroma with a citrus smell that’s not overwhelming. The calming aroma did indeed decrease my stress level and made me relax. Sun Essentials Oil of Bergamot has many useful purposes including, apply it topically to soothe insect bites, add it to bath water for an aromatic bath to help reduce stress and just a quick smell right from the bottle can restore a calming and positive attitude.&lt;br /&gt;Sun Essentials Oil of Bergamot comes with a dropper and in an economical 2oz glass bottle. I give it 5 stars for its many useful purposes. I was able to get this product for free for testing and my unbiased opinion. This is my opinion and mine only. Bergamot Oil can be used for many different things.</li>
    <li> This is not good essential oil.  I would return this if I hadn&#x27;t already opened it.  Don&#x27;t order it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased it is organic, but the strength of product seems very diluted and can barely smell the product. I purchased multiple oils and they all seem very faint in comparison to other organic essential oils.</li>
    <li> I bought this To save some money compared to Now oils Bergamot. Lost its scent after a few months. Only buying Now oil.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery. Product arrived as described. Great price!</li>
    <li> Great quality! Thx a lot!</li>
