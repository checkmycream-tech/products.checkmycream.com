      <li>Not that impressed they&#x27;re just ok</li>
      <li>The product is good, it holds the nail polish in it</li>
      <li>I would recommend these for sure!</li>
      <li>Seriously amazing)</li>
      <li>It was a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>I wish this had had some kind of adhesive bottom to keep them in one place.</li>
      <li>Nice product.  </li>
      <li>how handy these polish holders would be, and granted they won&#x27;t change your world, but they do make an at-home manicure easier.  </li>
      <li>liked that there were two I shared with my cousin.</li>
      <li>i have used this product for more than a month.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>These nail polish holders work well at preventing spills and stabilizing the bottles for those of us who insist on doing two or more tasks at once.</li>
      <li>Love them and wish I had them years ago.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK...</li>
      <li>Cute novelty anyway for the price.</li>
      <li>more spills.  </li>
      <li>I have not had a problem fitting any bottles yet.</li>
      <li>I even use as passenger in my car and have cute nails on the go</li>
      <li>It works for most of them.</li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>and they work great, plus they are very affordable.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how I was going to fit the nail polish in with out breaking them.</li>
      <li>Works great for my 5yr old</li>
      <li>Works good very helpful...</li>
      <li>the bottom easily comes off so you can slide the bottle through the bottom with NO</li>
      <li>This is so easy.  </li>
      <li>When they came they were rubber and easy to use.</li>
      <li>These look like they&#x27;ll do just fine, though.</li>
      <li>My last one took six months to get, so I was happy this one came quick!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found a polish that doesn&#x27;t fit in these.</li>
      <li>These holders securely hold my China Glaze bottles (upright or tilted) while doing my manicures.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>To cheap for return.</li>
      <li>Holds a bottle tipped on side securely which is what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Not all my bottles fit it.</li>
      <li>So that was cool.</li>
      <li>Came quick.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and what I wanted!</li>
      <li>great if you put nail polish on your leg or an uneven surface.</li>
      <li>They are about the same, not all shapes, sizes fit, but most do.  </li>
      <li>All in all..defiantly worth it.</li>
      <li>Price is right and they do not tip.</li>
      <li>and they can be a pain to hold, but I&#x27;ll manage ;)</li>
      <li>Larger ones will not be able to tilt, no room to move.  </li>
      <li>IF the polish bottles slide up, switch to a different size notch and it will most likely fit.</li>
      <li>The tipping isn&#x27;t as secure and tilted as I hoped though, still need both hands when polish gets low.  </li>
      <li>Fast, Sunday shipping even.</li>
      <li>Very helpful.</li>
      <li>They work well with all of my nail polish bottles and make it so much easier to paint my nails.</li>
      <li>Helps me feel more confident when using my expensive polishes.</li>
      <li>Not as pictured, but pretty much the same style, it works that is all I care about.</li>
      <li>I love these nail polish holders especially with having little ones running around while trying to paint my nails.</li>
      <li>Also they are quit big and therefor very stably; will not tip over.</li>
      <li>probably will order a couple more - when you are a klutz like I am or have small furries running about and don&#x27;t want to dump over a bottle when you are using alot of colors to do nail art, these can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
      <li>The only bottles that don&#x27;t stay put real well at an angle are my tiny bottles, like Bon Bons, and the really big bottles like Revlon.</li>
      <li>Came on time and of good material but its hard to use due to the extreme tightness of the opening.</li>
      <li>I used one today for the first time, it holds square and round bottles tipped just so,</li>

<li> I used one today for the first time, it holds square and round bottles tipped just so,</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t however weak super well with the mini sizes</li>
<li> far as the rubber, it is stiff and hopefully will retain shape as to hold the bottle properly.</li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the bottom is not made with any type of material to prevent slipping, so they do slide around easliy on a table.</li>
<li> I have used mine quite a few times and had no trouble at all.  </li>
<li> while you apply nail polish on ,it keep you from dropping the nail  polish wish ends up in a big mess.</li>
<li> Wet n Wild (multiple sizes), Spoiled, Finger Paints, Maybelline, L&#x27;oreal, Rimmel (multiple sizes), even the awkward shaped &amp;#34;5 Below&amp;#34; brand bottles, and they all fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Base came apart from top due to over-use...best to order 2 to have one as a back-up.</li>
<li> of the other reviewers stated problems getting the bottles in the somewhat stiff rubber.</li>
<li> Not as I thought they will not hold the little nailtiques bottles.</li>
<li> The holders protect the little bottles during travel, too.</li>
<li> I bought 2 of these little guys</li>
<li> O.P.I. Bottles will fit but very awkwardly.  </li>
<li> I was just hoping for the round ones.</li>
<li> Works with round or square bottles.  </li>
<li> I was not sure if these would work or not but for for the price I decided to give them a try.</li>
<li> Just not what I thought it would be :/</li>
<li> These holders are strictly for small bottles.  </li>
<li> It even holds my small Gelish Cleanser.  </li>
<li> No more spills.</li>
<li> I have various shaped bottles and it can be awkward to use with some of them.  </li>
<li> Some reviewers have complained about the bottles popping out of place when using the side notches for tilting...</li>
<li> I mean, they&#x27;ll work.</li>
<li> Got it, it is not good!</li>
<li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great if you put nail polish on your leg or an uneven surface.</li>
    <li> For some nail polishes it is so tall but I absolutaly think this ideain genius(idk if thats how u spell it...but it is. Seriously amazing)</li>
    <li> I got this and the oval holders.  They are about the same, not all shapes, sizes fit, but most do.  The tipping isn&#x27;t as secure and tilted as I hoped though, still need both hands when polish gets low.  I would buy again for the safety factor alone though.</li>
    <li> These holders securely hold my China Glaze bottles (upright or tilted) while doing my manicures.&lt;br /&gt;No more spills.  Definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Holds bottles snuggly.  Works with round or square bottles.  Holds a bottle tipped on side securely which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Product holds polish container...tilt-angle is adjustable. Base came apart from top due to over-use...best to order 2 to have one as a back-up.</li>
    <li> These holders are strictly for small bottles.  Larger ones will not be able to tilt, no room to move.  Cute novelty anyway for the price.</li>
    <li> Very nice rubber holders that do just as they are supposed to.  I have used mine quite a few times and had no trouble at all.  I would recommend these for sure!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and what I wanted! Excellent service!</li>
    <li> Finally a holder for all my different sized bottles. Each holder has 3 slots and each of the slots is a different shape and size. The only bottles that don&#x27;t stay put real well at an angle are my tiny bottles, like Bon Bons, and the really big bottles like Revlon. But they do stay in so no worries. Love them and wish I had them years ago. Also they are quit big and therefor very stably; will not tip over.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found a polish that doesn&#x27;t fit in these. Helps me feel more confident when using my expensive polishes. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> The product was not the same as the photos. O.P.I. Bottles will fit but very awkwardly.  They will, however, get the job done.</li>
    <li> Has worked well to hold bottles of polish at different angles.</li>
    <li> Works good very helpful...I love it...</li>
    <li> I had one my sister gave me and I got these two, probably will order a couple more - when you are a klutz like I am or have small furries running about and don&#x27;t want to dump over a bottle when you are using alot of colors to do nail art, these can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Not all my bottles fit it. It works for most of them.</li>
    <li> Very helpful. Came quick. Not as pictured, but pretty much the same style, it works that is all I care about. My last one took six months to get, so I was happy this one came quick!</li>
    <li> I got 2 oval ones, which isn&#x27;t what was listed. It&#x27;s OK... I mean, they&#x27;ll work. I was just hoping for the round ones. These look like they&#x27;ll do just fine, though. Fast, Sunday shipping even. So that was cool.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t look like the pictures at all.  I wanted the (3) slats openings and instead received solid with only one slat.</li>
    <li> Works great for my 5yr old</li>
    <li> I was not sure if these would work or not but for for the price I decided to give them a try. And I&#x27;m glad I did. They work well with all of my nail polish bottles and make it so much easier to paint my nails. Good buy!</li>
    <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about knocking the nail polish over when it is low in the bottle because you can tilt the bottle without spilling.</li>
    <li> The bottoms pop out and won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> Got it, it is not good! To cheap for return.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for more than a month. These nail polish holders work well at preventing spills and stabilizing the bottles for those of us who insist on doing two or more tasks at once. The holders protect the little bottles during travel, too.</li>
    <li> My daughter only had to spill polish once before I realized we needed something.  It even holds my small Gelish Cleanser.  This is so easy.  No more spills.</li>
    <li> Not that impressed they&#x27;re just ok but they do work. liked that there were two I shared with my cousin.</li>
    <li> I had no idea how handy these polish holders would be, and granted they won&#x27;t change your world, but they do make an at-home manicure easier.  Not only do they hold the bottle of polish but they allow the bottle to be tipped to get to the polish easier.</li>
    <li> These are both the same size. Both have different sized notches to tilt different size bottles when polish is running low. Some reviewers have complained about the bottles popping out of place when using the side notches for tilting...IF the polish bottles slide up, switch to a different size notch and it will most likely fit. I have not had a problem fitting any bottles yet. I tried LA Color, Essie, Revlon, Sally Hansen (multiple sizes), OPI, Wet n Wild (multiple sizes), Spoiled, Finger Paints, Maybelline, L&#x27;oreal, Rimmel (multiple sizes), even the awkward shaped &amp;#34;5 Below&amp;#34; brand bottles, and they all fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other reviewers stated problems getting the bottles in the somewhat stiff rubber. HOWEVER- the bottom easily comes off so you can slide the bottle through the bottom with NO problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the rubber, it is stiff and hopefully will retain shape as to hold the bottle properly. I just got them so only time will tell. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the bottom is not made with any type of material to prevent slipping, so they do slide around easliy on a table.</li>
    <li> On the cover picture they look plastic. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how I was going to fit the nail polish in with out breaking them. When they came they were rubber and easy to use. I also got 4 when I thought I was only getting 2. It was a nice surprise. All in all..defiantly worth it.</li>
    <li> The product is good, it holds the nail polish in it place while you apply nail polish on ,it keep you from dropping the nail  polish wish ends up in a big mess.</li>
    <li> Came on time and of good material but its hard to use due to the extreme tightness of the opening.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these little guys and they work great, plus they are very affordable. I no longer worry about the kids doing their nails at the table.</li>
    <li> I wish this had had some kind of adhesive bottom to keep them in one place. Just not what I thought it would be :/</li>
    <li> Looked in every store I could think of for these, including beauty supply houses. Nada. Found them! I&#x27;m a happy girl!</li>
    <li> For just a couple bucks you beta set of 2.  I used one today for the first time, it holds square and round bottles tipped just so, that way you can actually use that 1/2 of the bottle without spilling it or trying to hold it.  It doesn&#x27;t however weak super well with the mini sizes, lol. I got some this Fall and they can be a pain to hold, but I&#x27;ll manage ;)&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it says with no frills!</li>
    <li> I have various shaped bottles and it can be awkward to use with some of them.  Price is right and they do not tip.</li>
    <li> Not as I thought they will not hold the little nailtiques bottles.</li>
    <li> I love these nail polish holders especially with having little ones running around while trying to paint my nails. I don&#x27;t have to worry about kids knocking over the bottle.</li>
