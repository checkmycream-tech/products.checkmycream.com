<li> ,I bought this item and Yacht Man Red by Myrurgia Eau De Toilette Spray for Men, 3.40 Ounce making my mind that after this i use the yacht spray, it was a waste of money buying the yacht because this thing last on me 24hrs a day and Yacht last on me for like 10mins</li>

<li> In response to the possible safety concerns,[citation needed] the company created two ads, one against the use of Axe as an inhalant, and the other warning of its flammability.[40]</li>
<li> I got the AXE (the other scent).  </li>
<li> The scent is not cheap smelling</li>
<li> So, duhhh, I&#x27;m gonna buy this (Phoenix) the next time!</li>
<li> It is getting hard to get it in the stores.</li>
<li> Awful overpoweringly heavy scents reminiscent of locker rooms.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s no longer a subscribe and save option anymore.  </li>
<li> i have a random meeting come in after being in the field</li>
<li> , one bad thing is that sometimes the lid gets in the way and disables the sprayer.</li>

    <li> Axe Bodyspray, Phoenix 4 oz, Twin Pack. Nice smell</li>
    <li> On January 12, 2008 12 year old Daniel Hurley from Derbyshire, England died in a hospital five days after collapsing at his home. The medical coroner ruled that he had suffered from cardiac arrhythmia and died from heart failure as a result of spraying large amounts of Lynx in a confined space.[37][38] Videos on social networking sites depicted teens lighting themselves on fire. The trend resulted in multiple injuries.[39] In response to the possible safety concerns,[citation needed] the company created two ads, one against the use of Axe as an inhalant, and the other warning of its flammability.[40]</li>
    <li> Decent product for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and thought I got a good deal. Not so. The spray cans I received were 4 ounce not 8 ounce cans.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby.......He loves it and so do I!  THANKS</li>
    <li> Long lasting smell that smells great</li>
    <li> This particular scent, &amp;#34;Phoenix&amp;#34; has got to be one of my favorite scents. It&#x27;s not too strong like some of the others and is quite manly according to my gf who loves it! Great deal!</li>
    <li> Not as pictured. Not what you see in Target/Walmart.</li>
    <li> Great scent but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> ok not a huge fan of the scent</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift by request.  I would never buy Axe anything for myself.  Awful overpoweringly heavy scents reminiscent of locker rooms.  If you want to smell like sweat, save the money and skip a shower.  Men&#x27;s fragrances are best when light and fresh.  Of the less expensive stuff in stores, I find Adidas scents to be better.  I know these are personal choices, but I can smell an Axe wearer from across the room.  Come on now...</li>
    <li> same great product as I buy in the local discount store, but the price was great.  I even added it to my subscribe-and-save order, and saved more.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend cause the Axe kit didn&#x27;t have spray so it was okay cause it all worked out.</li>
    <li> Everyone is different in how they smell a spray. Your body makeup also effects how the&lt;br /&gt;spray is smelled by another person. This product was avaiable in Thailand for a short&lt;br /&gt;time and now cannot find. I like the smell and so does the girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;What else can i say?</li>
    <li> came just like it said I got it for my nephew for his xmas gift and he is going to love it.</li>
    <li> the spray is excellent, the smell is wonderful and you don&#x27;t need too much to put on, and last all day well most of the day at least. highly recommended to all men. thanks</li>
    <li> its awesome !!!&lt;br /&gt;there is a saying that good thing sells its self ,I bought this item and Yacht Man Red by Myrurgia Eau De Toilette Spray for Men, 3.40 Ounce making my mind that after this i use the yacht spray, it was a waste of money buying the yacht because this thing last on me 24hrs a day and Yacht last on me for like 10mins an its all gone and when i am about to sleep in the evening i can still smell it ,i wish i can buy one again but i have no money to buy it .good product from axe the best body spray i have ever use.This body spray never hurts your skin because i remember using old species and my armpit start peeling off because it wasn&#x27;t good for my skin but this one is 100% perfect for everybody to use</li>
    <li> great price for 2 pack. nice clean and light fragrance.</li>
    <li> gotta smell good and this does</li>
    <li> He loved this. Would purchase again. The scent is not cheap smelling</li>
    <li> The women I work with really love the way I smell. I like it too. I hope they will keep making phoenix. It is getting hard to get it in the stores. Too many new scents coming out. Just don&#x27;t over do it or you will smell like a d-bag.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 27 year old son, and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Smell is good, but not so much long lasting...</li>
    <li> This spray smells SO good. I love it!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite brand!</li>
    <li> Cheaper here (on subscribe and save) than in the drug store.  I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s no longer a subscribe and save option anymore.  My honey smells amazing when he uses this. I like it as well as many of the high dollar mall scents.</li>
    <li> Great scent  will purchase again.</li>
    <li> does not stain clothes, leave residue, and can be used anywhere. keep one in my car so no matter where i am i can always freshen up before running to mrs family functions.Also keep one in my desk at work just in case i have a random meeting come in after being in the field</li>
    <li> Been fool by the deal...got 3 8 oz twin pack &#x3D; 6; 4 oz bottle.for 45 bucks ..same time there was another deal 6 pack 4 oz for 25 bucks..deal was saying 8 oz twin pack so I thought I will get 2 8 oz bottles.</li>
    <li> Just awesome! The smell is very good and keep my body smelling wonderful all the day!</li>
    <li> My teen goes through this stuff like water. Amazon has the best deals and prices. I have a feeling I will be buying a lot more of this stuff.</li>
    <li> like the rwist top so it make it child proof so you can leave it on the bathroom counter top with out haveing your body spray emtpyed buy one of the kids.</li>
    <li> I got the AXE (the other scent).  The reviews were higher for this scent so I tried it.  I got more compliments from this scent..  So, duhhh, I&#x27;m gonna buy this (Phoenix) the next time!</li>
    <li> I keep one at the gym locker one at school. work, it&#x27;s not smelly like a cologne. it&#x27;s a light clean smell. , one bad thing is that sometimes the lid gets in the way and disables the sprayer.</li>
    <li> The spray exactly works as advertised, well mostly, I don&#x27;t have women chasing me.  But I do get compliments and that&#x27;s nice.</li>
