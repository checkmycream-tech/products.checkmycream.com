      <li>and I have turned out loving it</li>
      <li>in all, it&#x27;s a good hair product; definitely better than waxes I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>jar is good because most pomades come in 2.5 or 3.  </li>
      <li>One of my good friends recommended this brand and product to me and I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the quality, the smell, and the ease of use of the product.</li>
      <li>but I got used to it and kind of liked it.  </li>
      <li>The smell seemed light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the lightweight consistency and lovely scent!</li>
      <li>Best wax I have ever used, professional look</li>
      <li>in all, it is a great product for ME, every product works different for every hair type, I was told Hanz De Fuko would be great</li>
      <li>I had tried the American Crew pomade, and while it had great shine, it did not have great hold.  </li>
      <li>in all, it is a great product for ME, every product works different for every hair type, I was told Hanz De Fuko would be great</li>
      <li>Crystal is supposed to be a bit stronger, but believe me, original has a very nice strong hold even for longer hair.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>Most pomades recommend a finger tip amount of product, I dont know about you</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better</li>
      <li>So I hope this helped everyone, enjoy and keep styling!</li>
      <li>Now most water based pomades harden up when you leave them in your hair</li>

      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s better on your hair than gel</li>
      <li>, I have seen people say it smells like flowers, others berries but in my opinion when I smell this product I am more reminded of the beach</li>
      <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s slightly more feminine scented.  </li>

      <li>It was ok I was expecting much better results for the price.</li>
      <li>I wanted something that offered more shine.  </li>
      <li>This product is just ok.</li>
      <li>Be sure to have it evenly spread amongst your hair for maximum utilization of product.  </li>
      <li>Doing some research online, there have been many complaints that gel effects hair growth.</li>
      <li>so all in all its great for my particular style</li>

      <li>/&gt;Scent-Now the biggest thing I have read about this product is the scent, some people saying its too strong, others saying it smells girly and others that love it.</li>
      <li>Wow the smell of this product is amazing!</li>
      <li>So I hope this helped everyone, enjoy and keep styling!fy pompadour and</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, works easily, never fails.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s quite unique.  </li>
      <li>, it may even replace my current favorite Uppercut Deluxe Pomade.</li>
      <li>, it may even replace my current favorite Uppercut Deluxe Pomade.</li>
      <li>I have tried almost every pomade on the market, and Star Wax Original by Star Pro Line is BY FAR my favorite!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First off, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried, it smells great.  </li>
      <li>So the way styling ability with this product is great, it has a thick consistency which is what keeps all the hairs together better</li>
      <li>So the way styling ability with this product is great, it has a thick consistency which is what keeps all the hairs together better</li>
      <li>It actually smells pretty good and despite the bright red color, applies well</li>
      <li>So far, I have tried the Original and I must say it is a top notch product,</li>
      <li>I can honestly say this is the first product that a finger tip full was literally all i needed, I did half a tip full just to be safe.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
      <li>Star Wax is amazing not only does it hold well</li>
      <li>even combing it was simple, the comb glides through and the hair honestly just seems to fall into place with it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Basically, it smells like cheap women&#x27;s perfume and you will be able to smell it on your hair throughout the entire day.</li>
      <li>Is it worth $20?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this more than any other product I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>Not only does the product have strong hold, it easily washes out in the shower with just water.</li>
      <li>The price is right, I paid $25 for a 5 fl.</li>
      <li>Gives a nice firm hold with shine and washes out easily.</li>
      <li>The Original and Crystal work decent</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s pretty good if you need something with a nice hold and shine but don&#x27;t want to worry about the difficulty of washing away something based on a heavy wax.</li>
      <li>also it&#x27;s bigger than most hair products so the price is worth it.</li>
      <li>Great wax, extreme hold gives a natural shine to the hair.</li>
      <li>It will be interesting to see with the next purchase if the quality changes from batch to batch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It will be interesting to see with the next purchase if the quality changes from batch to batch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast shipper also!  </li>
      <li>Smells perfumey at first</li>
      <li>so if you want that gel stiff look this is good.</li>
      <li>This does hold pretty strong and it stays &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; so you can style the hair and then 2 hours later you could style it totally different without using more pomade and it would hold just as well.</li>
      <li>I barely use more than a quarter size dot of the wax, and it will completely hold up my hair in all situations, whether outdoors in the heat or in humid weather.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t easily restyle later in the day.</li>
      <li>stretching my first jar of star wax for over a year, I re-ordered another 5oz jar of original star wax (from the same seller).  </li>
      <li>stretching my first jar of star wax for over a year, I re-ordered another 5oz jar of original star wax (from the same seller).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also water-soluble so when I wash it off my hands it gets off without much effort.</li>
      <li>What I really wanted was a grooming pomade.  </li>
      <li>Hello everyone, I have been researching these products for sometime now being that they are slightly more expensive and finally this week I ordered the Original &amp; Clay and here is my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product because of the mostly positive reviews on amazon and one on youtube.</li>
      <li>It has a strong hold and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>After dealing with other products that gifted me any combination of frizzing, flaking, and drying out my hair, I searched stores and internet sites for a pomade that gave hold and shine.  </li>
      <li>(see Paul Mitchell and Redken).&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, like other reviews mention, it does have a decent texture that allows you to work it into you hair pretty easily.  </li>
      <li>So in my experience while the smell is strong when you sniff it, for my experience it isn&#x27;t like people say that you can smell it from so far away and all that, but again everyones different just in my experience with it, I didnt find it to be as pungent as people have</li>
      <li>I would recommend using this product when the hair is almost or completely dry...seems to have much better hold on dry rather than damp hair.  </li>
      <li>Leaves scalp and fingers greasy feeling which is main reason I&#x27;m not using it much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is about 6 or 7 inches on top and very short (2 guard) on sides and back.  </li>
      <li>I have used many different pomades, waxes and clays from high end to low end.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After doing some research on google, StarWax came highly recommended and I see why.</li>
      <li>extra tidbits worth mentioning:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>it melts down easy and applies to the hair with ease,</li>
      <li>a water based pomade, it doesn&#x27;t easily wash out which is odd.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t take long for me to develop a splitting headache from the powerful fragrance of this</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is just ok. I&#x27;ve had better</li>
    <li> i love this product, it has good hold, good smell, and is 5fl oz, just what i need for my hair.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product because of the mostly positive reviews on amazon and one on youtube. When I got the product, I opened the jar and smelled it. The smell seemed light and pleasant. However, when I put in in my hair and wore it throughout the day, I soon realized that this product&#x27;s fragrance is awful and overpowering. Basically, it smells like cheap women&#x27;s perfume and you will be able to smell it on your hair throughout the entire day. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to develop a splitting headache from the powerful fragrance of this pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the hold is not great. I would describe this product more as a weak gel than a wax or pomade. My hair fell flat after a few hours and the back of my hair looked super matte like I had nothing in it at all. This product is not good if you have thick hair and are looking to sculpt it or hold it in place. After about 8 hours my hair basically looked like it barely had anything in it. Far from a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; grade product and not worth the $25 price tag.</li>
    <li> This wax made my hair too stiff.  What I really wanted was a grooming pomade.  Found an excellent one from Prive.</li>
    <li> Wow the smell of this product is amazing! I love the smell of this more than any other product I have ever tried. The shine and hold are also great as well. Please check this product out!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, works easily, never fails.</li>
    <li> Before this purchase, I had never spent more than $10 on a haircare product for myself; obviously, that was why I was frustrated when it came to achieving the look/hold I wanted.  After dealing with other products that gifted me any combination of frizzing, flaking, and drying out my hair, I searched stores and internet sites for a pomade that gave hold and shine.  Reading Amazon reviews for other products, I stumbled upon Star Wax and decided to spend the extra money...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried, it smells great.  To some people, this isn&#x27;t a big deal, but to me, if something&#x27;s $20 and it smells like poo, it&#x27;s a deal breaker (see Paul Mitchell and Redken).&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, like other reviews mention, it does have a decent texture that allows you to work it into you hair pretty easily.  I found having my hair slightly damp helps this process.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as others have stated, it does wash off of your hands after applying it to your hair easier than most products; the same can be said for washing it out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two extra tidbits worth mentioning:&lt;br /&gt;1) if used in moderation - THIN coating that makes your fingertips slightly glisten, it&#x27;s a frizz-fighting pomade that gives you a faint sheen with decent sculpting control (hair remaining soft to the touch) that lasts a full work day in the warm climate of Virginia...I&#x27;ll update this when the summer hits!  After months of use, I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair drying out like it did with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;2) if over used - \\&quot;glob style\\&quot; or anything above a thin coating on your fingertips - it acts more like a gel, delivering a tight hold with mild sheen.  The unfortunate trade-off is you&#x27;re hair has that hard, crunchy-like, cheeto sculpture texture.  If this is the application you&#x27;re hoping for, I&#x27;d recommend buying an American Crew Hair gel product for the cost savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a good hair product; definitely better than waxes I&#x27;ve tried.  Is it worth $20?&lt;br /&gt;I think so, especially compared to other similar products on the market that give you less product for the same price (Star Wax is a 5oz jar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again when I run out?&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how long this batch lasts, I&#x27;d probably buy it again.  It will be interesting to see with the next purchase if the quality changes from batch to batch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT RE-ORDER UPDATE 9/13/13&lt;br /&gt;After stretching my first jar of star wax for over a year, I re-ordered another 5oz jar of original star wax (from the same seller).  Not only was the jar shape different, the smell was also different.  The newer fragrance isn&#x27;t horrible but not what I was use to from the previous batch (1 of the many reasons I bought again).  In my opinion, it&#x27;s slightly more feminine scented.  Will try to post another update if the style hold is different....&gt;I think so, especially compared to other similar products on the market that give you less product for the same price (Star Wax is a 5oz jar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again when I run out?&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how long this batch lasts, I&#x27;d probably buy it again.

    <li> I have used many different pomades, waxes and clays from high end to low end. This &amp;#34;pomade&amp;#34; ranks down with the cheap dept store brand gels. It stinks like cheap woman&#x27;s perfume and it makes your hair hard and crusty. Then after an hour your hair looks frizzy, like you put nothing in it. The positive reviews are clearly fake. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again if it was $5.</li>
    <li> This product has been great. Gives a nice firm hold with shine and washes out easily.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product that can handle my hair type and allow me to have flexibility in changing the way my hair is styled with ease. I&#x27;ve used different brands and product types, but this pomade is just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research on google, StarWax came highly recommended and I see why. The price is right, I paid $25 for a 5 fl. oz. jar. It actually smells pretty good and despite the bright red color, applies well and no tell tail signs in black hair of a red product being applied. It has a strong hold and lasts a long time. One of the reasons I was looking, is I have greasy hair and normally a product will last a few hours being needing to re-apply. With Star Wax, it will last all day and night. I remember once having a lazy morning and the previous days pomade still provided lift to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment I have for this product, is be careful on how much you apply, its strong stuff, so you only need a small amount - even for challenging hair like mine</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase and this particular one turns my husbands mustache the color of the pomade, the others did not.</li>
    <li> good product works well</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is stubborn but this was weak sauce &amp; really didn&#x27;t feel any different then a standard gel.&lt;br /&gt;Even at $5, it would be useless for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought Gatsy Moving Rubber and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re used to heavy waxes, Star Wax might feel different for you, since it doesn&#x27;t give the same type of hold/shine of traditional waxes. It definitely feels less oily. It&#x27;s also water-soluble so when I wash it off my hands it gets off without much effort. Overall, it&#x27;s pretty good if you need something with a nice hold and shine but don&#x27;t want to worry about the difficulty of washing away something based on a heavy wax. It&#x27;s thick and sticky so it does the job well, but doesn&#x27;t punish you when it&#x27;s time to get rid of it. The nice scent is a bonus. And the price on Amazon is similar to the price at my salon.</li>
    <li> Best wax I have ever used, professional look</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair a bit stiff. It&#x27;s not bad. Smells perfumey at first but that goes away (I believe.....).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a water based pomade, it doesn&#x27;t easily wash out which is odd. I like it but won&#x27;t buy again. Can&#x27;t easily restyle later in the day. Leaves scalp and fingers greasy feeling which is main reason I&#x27;m not using it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better on your hair than gel so if you want that gel stiff look this is good.</li>
    <li> Star Wax is amazing not only does it hold well but you can also run your hands through your hair and restyle without butchering your hair!!! The days of flakes and stiff hair are coming to an end!</li>
    <li> I had used the American Crew fiber and got tired of the matte look.  I wanted something that offered more shine.  I had tried the American Crew pomade, and while it had great shine, it did not have great hold.  I bought the Star Wax premium pomade.  It locked my style in place and it had the shine.  The fragrance was different but I got used to it and kind of liked it.  Unfortunately, a rash developed behind both my ears.  I initially blamed a new shampoo and discontinued that.  But the rash remained until I stopped using the Star Wax.  I went to a combination of American Crew pomade for the shine and initial styling, plus American Crew Styling Spray for the extra hold.  I rate the Star Wax Premium Pomade 3 stars based on my experience.</li>
    <li> applying this you will get lots of shine and it has an amazing hold and adds a lot of volume, after a few hours it will dry and turn to a matte finish which I don&#x27;t mind but I&#x27;d recommend this and repurchase. also it&#x27;s bigger than most hair products so the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every pomade on the market, and Star Wax Original by Star Pro Line is BY FAR my favorite! I absolutely love the lightweight consistency and lovely scent! Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and the smell is amazing, it&#x27;s quite unique.  This does hold pretty strong and it stays &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; so you can style the hair and then 2 hours later you could style it totally different without using more pomade and it would hold just as well.</li>
    <li> The Original and Crystal work decent,I definetly recommend the Clay as it has,in my opinion,the greatest scent of all 3 pomades.</li>
    <li> Great smell, sticky and good hold.  My hair is about 6 or 7 inches on top and very short (2 guard) on sides and back.  I have a pompadour and it works well with this type of haircut.  I would recommend using this product when the hair is almost or completely dry...seems to have much better hold on dry rather than damp hair.  5 oz. jar is good because most pomades come in 2.5 or 3.  Be sure to have it evenly spread amongst your hair for maximum utilization of product.  I will be buying this when it runs out in approximately 3 months...I might try the crystal also just to compare the two.  Crystal is supposed to be a bit stronger, but believe me, original has a very nice strong hold even for longer hair.  Great product Star Pro Line!  Fast shipper also!  *****</li>
    <li> It was ok I was expecting much better results for the price.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone, I have been researching these products for sometime now being that they are slightly more expensive and finally this week I ordered the Original &amp; Clay and here is my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent-Now the biggest thing I have read about this product is the scent, some people saying its too strong, others saying it smells girly and others that love it. Yes, the scent is there, you will smell it when you open it, I have seen people say it smells like flowers, others berries but in my opinion when I smell this product I am more reminded of the beach and i dont know about you but the beach isn&#x27;t a girly smell who hasn&#x27;t gone to the beach and smelled like, well, the beach? I wore it in my hair, left the container in my room and honestly, no one said they noticed anything until they stood within close proximity to me. So in my experience while the smell is strong when you sniff it, for my experience it isn&#x27;t like people say that you can smell it from so far away and all that, but again everyones different just in my experience with it, I didnt find it to be as pungent as people have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency- The product does have a thick consistency, but once you start rubbing it in your hands it melts down easy and applies to the hair with ease, even combing it was simple, the comb glides through and the hair honestly just seems to fall into place with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styling ability-So far, I have tried the Original and I must say it is a top notch product, everything from the scent consistency and hold is great even the way it helped my hair is phenomenal. Most pomades recommend a finger tip amount of product, I dont know about you but I have very thick and wavy hair and I would always have to use at least 3-4 finger scoops to tame my hair and thats of heavy hold products. I can honestly say this is the first product that a finger tip full was literally all i needed, I did half a tip full just to be safe. I style my hair as a slicked back or a quiffy pompadour and this product held all the hair together slicked back and raised up in a pomp. So the way styling ability with this product is great, it has a thick consistency which is what keeps all the hairs together better so all in all its great for my particular style so maybe it won&#x27;t work that well for a different hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hardening up- Now most water based pomades harden up when you leave them in your hair, I personally find this to be determined by how much pomade you apply and in this case not much product was needed so i didnt experience much crunchy hard textures from the product drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a great product for ME, every product works different for every hair type, I was told Hanz De Fuko would be great and they didnt work well for me. So if you can try it out, its a great product if it works with your hair type and style. I was weary but i took the shot and I have turned out loving it, it may even replace my current favorite Uppercut Deluxe Pomade. So I hope this helped everyone, enjoy and keep styling!fy pompadour and this product held all the hair together slicked back and raised up in a pomp.

    <li> I used to use a entire bottle of gel in 2 weeks. Because of the frequency that I was using the gel, I started to notice that I was losing hair when I was showering. Doing some research online, there have been many complaints that gel effects hair growth. Not wishing to lose my hair in my early 20&#x27;s, I started looking for an alternative. One of my good friends recommended this brand and product to me and I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the quality, the smell, and the ease of use of the product. I barely use more than a quarter size dot of the wax, and it will completely hold up my hair in all situations, whether outdoors in the heat or in humid weather. Not only does the product have strong hold, it easily washes out in the shower with just water. A++ product</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product I can use. It&#x27;s a game changer for people with thick hair who have a hard time styling their hair. I&#x27;ve been using the product for 3 years now, and don&#x27;t plan on stopping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great too!</li>
    <li> Great wax, extreme hold gives a natural shine to the hair.</li>
