<li> Not worth getting and not from this store</li>
<li> so I bought a few packs for her.  </li>
<li> These were way too small  to use on the average person.</li>
<li> The plastic wasn&#x27;t as hard as I had hoped.</li>

    <li> These were the curlers I had been looking for and they are a good size.  Its great to know I can get them over the internet.  They were not in any of the stores around here.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to arrive, but these are so hard to find, so that was ok! My elderly mom still uses these and I was thrilled to find them. I also ordered the next size up...!</li>

    <li> After my Mom (who is 91) survived a fire in her home she lost her pink curlers and was very upset. When I found these on Amazon I purchased them immediately. Although they are not the same size as the ones that she previously had she is SO glad to have her pink curlers back.</li>

    <li> These were way too small  to use on the average person. Outside of someone using these on EXTREMELY SHORT HAIR, do not buy these.</li>
