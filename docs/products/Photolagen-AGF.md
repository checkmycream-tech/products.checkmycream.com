      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a number of years and can purchase it via Amazon at significant savings.</li>

      <li>My skin tone is more even and the texture of my skin is now soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Great for my combination, dark skin.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that this serum works for exact this skin issue!</li>
      <li>I have taken very good care of my skin, starting when I was a teen.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many products and spent a fortune, but never been truly satisfied with anything..until AminoGenesis Photolagen AFG.  </li>
      <li>I also wear a light moisturizer over it because I live in an arid climate.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s with monthly breakouts and have noticed sun damage and fine lines creeping up.  </li>
      <li>You just have to use a little and in 3 weeks my skin was clear, soft and flawless ..</li>
      <li>Absolutely !</li>
      <li>I started using AminoGenesis as one of the first things I did in my regime</li>
      <li>Simple and easy.</li>
      <li>So I would imagine if your skin is super sensitive or you are also using retinoids and/or glycolic acid</li>
      <li>I have always had oily skin with whiteheads and large pores.  </li>
      <li>brown spots, white spots, blotchiness, fine lines, loss of contour.  </li>
      <li>I have only been using it for a month; but I knew the first time I applied it that this was special.  </li>
      <li>The photolagen claims to do everything to a face but really does nothing,</li>
      <li>I can really see and feel the difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>As I aged I saw the many years of sun worship take</li>
      <li>I used this in conjunction with the Really Really Clean Beautifying Cleanser (which I also liked), and I got a little pink.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, not to heavy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my acne prone skin break out.</li>
      <li>For the first week I really thought the improvement was only obvious to me; but then I began receiving comments from my friends, son, supervisor and even my lawyer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve taken precautions against the sun, moisturized and used sunscreens; I am 60 years old.  </li>
      <li>Been using for a month as instructed and took before after pics, makes no difference in my face at all just broke out my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too early to speak about the effectiveness in diminishing brown spots, but I can already see and feel the difference in my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, there are much better treatments that perform beautifully available on amazon for less than half of retail spa cost.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the product in the past, but really didn&#x27;t see much result.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s come down ALOT in price since I first started using it 5 years ago</li>
      <li>My skin is clearer and the dark spots are fading all ready.</li>
      <li>Some of my dark spots are really clearing up.  </li>
      <li>In combination with diet, a few other products I use, light therapy and supplements</li>
      <li>for the first few days as opposed to the prescribed twice a day.</li>
      <li>i noticed a difference in the first few days.</li>
      <li>The only other amino genesis products I&#x27;d recommend are the gel cleanser for normal or oily skin only, and the night oil capsules w the AG face cream combined, that&#x27;s about it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So far, so good.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny an more. In combination with diet, a few other products I use, light therapy and supplements I take I can say it must do something because I was not blessed with youthful or nice skin, quiet the opposite. As a 45 yr old I had suddenly aged 5 years ago! So I did research, tried things and this is one of them that has stuck. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 years now. A little dab goes a long way. I get about 2+ months out of a bottle, and I use it on my neck as well. It&#x27;s very light, not to heavy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my acne prone skin break out. This has reduced age spots (darker patches) an fine lines, even helped reduce some heavier ones. Skin feels fresh an clean yet when applied. So Light I even use the moisturizer over it, but don&#x27;t need to unless wearing makeup. It&#x27;s come down ALOT in price since I first started using it 5 years ago so I stock up (I may just use it everywhere! LOL). P.S. I started using AminoGenesis as one of the first things I did in my regime an added the others. I stopped using this looking for something less expensive, but came back to it. And as luck will have it the price has dropped thank goodness.</li>
    <li> This product contains parabens.  That&#x27;s the bad news.......the good news is that it really works!  It does take a month or two  months to start seeing results.</li>
    <li> This product has taken years off my face and neck and at fifty this is quite welcome.  My skin tone is more even and the texture of my skin is now soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s with monthly breakouts and have noticed sun damage and fine lines creeping up.  I&#x27;ve tried the product in the past, but really didn&#x27;t see much result.  However, this time I have seen the sun damage and fine lines lessen on my face and chest. A little bit goes a long way! I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 3 weeks and am really pleased with it.  I wear mineral make-up and have to be sure the product dries before applying that type of make-up.  I also wear a light moisturizer over it because I live in an arid climate.  I should also note I now use a Clarsonic brush, which may be helping with absorption of the product this time around.</li>
    <li> I have taken very good care of my skin, starting when I was a teen.  I&#x27;ve taken precautions against the sun, moisturized and used sunscreens; I am 60 years old.  After hearing raves about this product, I purchased a container and followed manufacturer&#x27;s directions and used it for ~30 days.  I saw and experienced no changes in my facial skin, so I used it on the skin of my hands.  Again, no difference pre- and post- application, trial period ~15 days.  I&#x27;m back to using Lancome and L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line of AminoGenesis for about 6 months now.  I can really see and feel the difference in my skin.  I love this Repair Serum.  Some of my dark spots are really clearing up.  Love this line of skin care.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was recommended by my esthetician and works well on over age 50 skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a number of years and can purchase it via Amazon at significant savings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 46 with lots of skin issues.  I have always had oily skin with whiteheads and large pores.  As I aged I saw the many years of sun worship take it&#x27;s toll on my face; brown spots, white spots, blotchiness, fine lines, loss of contour.  I have tried so many products and spent a fortune, but never been truly satisfied with anything..until AminoGenesis Photolagen AFG.  I have only been using it for a month; but I knew the first time I applied it that this was special.  It is silky on application, yet not greasy at all.  It immediately plumps up my fine lines, and in the morning my skin is noticably more even and radiant. In my opinion, this product, along with ongoing use of my facial stimulation device, has taken years off my face in a very short time.  For the first week I really thought the improvement was only obvious to me; but then I began receiving comments from my friends, son, supervisor and even my lawyer.  I am now going to try more of the product line.  I have never in my life written a review, and trust me when I say I have used the \\&quot;best\\&quot; skincare products that are out there. I am a life-long beauty product junkie, passionate about skincare and makeup. I am very impressed with AG Photolagen AFG and really encourage anyone wanting to reverse years of skin damage and aging in general to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t explain what and why this serum is good exactly. But! I can&#x27;t stop using it. Because I know my skin will get bad condition if I quite. I&#x27;ve got stuck!  I can&#x27;t say that this serum works for exact this skin issue! I think this serum works for all round.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now I think I can see some difference in my lite wrinkles and some small difference in my facial lines I am in my sixties so will take longer to show effects  I will keep using this and look for more results</li>
    <li> The jar only had 31 treatments in it, not 40 as indicated.  Therefore, I received less then 2 ozs as advertised.</li>
    <li> I get really good results with this product. Aminogenesis makes a great line of skin care products that I love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a grown up gal who loved the beaches of California when I was growning up. This is the product for my face &amp; I can already see improvements. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> The product came in tact and on time.</li>
    <li> Liked this product but was a bit pricy, I would definitely buy it again if it were less expensive.  Does it work?  Absolutely !</li>
    <li> Been using for a month as instructed and took before after pics, makes no difference in my face at all just broke out my sensitive skin.  The photolagen claims to do everything to a face but really does nothing, even the texture of the product feels watery and blah. Don&#x27;t waste your money, there are much better treatments that perform beautifully available on amazon for less than half of retail spa cost.  I should&#x27;ve asked my facialist about this before buying it but the price was cheap than at spa so I bought it.  The only other amino genesis products I&#x27;d recommend are the gel cleanser for normal or oily skin only, and the night oil capsules w the AG face cream combined, that&#x27;s about it.  Still, nothing special and the face cream doesn&#x27;t moisturize well so I have to supplement w other creams.  The body cocoon doesn&#x27;t work at all on any skin issues as advertised, either. Sorry AG, you need to revamp your product line and stop w false advertising.</li>
    <li> This thing is the best  product I have ever used for blemishes and sun spots! It&#x27;s become my daily prayer!  You just have to use a little and in 3 weeks my skin was clear, soft and flawless .. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible i noticed a difference in the first few days. My skin is clearer and the dark spots are fading all ready. Great for my combination, dark skin.</li>
    <li> aminogenesis is an amazing and great product its lightweight and does exactly what it says anyone who has pigmented skin must try!</li>
    <li> love this product, it works! Light and fresh it absorbs easily.  Feels like freshness on your face. Simple and easy.</li>
    <li> Excellent for over exposed to the sun faces</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early to speak about the effectiveness in diminishing brown spots, but I can already see and feel the difference in my skin&#x27;s texture.As a matter of fact my husband was looking at my skin in the bright light and thought he could see the difference. He said my skin looked a lot smoother. He uses this after shaving and I could see the difference in his skin too. I love the non greasy feel of this product and easy application. I also like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use a toner (the directions tell you not to when using this). I used this in conjunction with the Really Really Clean Beautifying Cleanser (which I also liked), and I got a little pink. But I am 57 and try to take care of my skin and also use Retin A and glycolic acid once a week. So I would imagine if your skin is super sensitive or you are also using retinoids and/or glycolic acid try this once a day ( I think night time would be best)  for the first few days as opposed to the prescribed twice a day.</li>
