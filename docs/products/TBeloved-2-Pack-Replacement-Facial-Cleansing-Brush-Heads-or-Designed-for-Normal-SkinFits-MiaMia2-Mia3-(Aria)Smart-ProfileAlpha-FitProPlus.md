<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received the brush heads on time, as they said.  The brush is the problem.  I really was hoping that it would be just as good as the original brush head, but it&#x27;s not.  The original brush head made my skin feel so soft and silky after using it, and also the center of the original brush moves but this head does not.  I don&#x27;t know if the original spun while using, but it does move when you push your finger around on it.  So I guess the adage if it&#x27;s too good to be true....</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of purchasing this product, because i&#x27;ve always purchased only the Clarisonic replacement brush heads for my Clarisonic Pro, but the replacements head are pretty spend. So, I purchased these without any expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these brush heads, they fit my Pro series perfectly, they withstand a great deal of use from me. I use my electronic brush 2-3 times a day, needless to say I&#x27;m pleased and would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the name brand version.</li>
    <li> These bristles are a little bit softer then the original, but still clean just as well.</li>
    <li> Great price. Fit my Clarisonic perfectly. Shipping took a little longer than I&#x27;m used to with Amazon but I believe they are shipped from overseas. I&#x27;m willing to wait for such a quality product as such an amazing price. I will continue to order these as my replacement heads from now on.</li>
    <li> These are amazing.  They are even better that the originals. Shipping is slow, but well worth it.  No need to pay the $40 for one original brush.</li>
    <li> Great price.  I love the savings.</li>
    <li> These brushes are durable &amp; not coarse on my facial skin.  I have been using the Clarisonic cleansing brush for 10 years, 2x a day.  It&#x27;s the best way to thoroughly clean your face in order to slough off dried skin cells &amp; clear clogged pores.  I notice a difference because my moisturizers are able to penetrate the skin because they are not blocked by dried skin, therefore, leaving a supple, smooth finish to my face.</li>
    <li> I thought I would save some money by getting these instead of the original more expensive ones all I did was throw money away . Horrible did not work they look the same and fit on the machine but then nothing no movement no vibration no good .</li>
    <li> The product it self is fine,  but the time it took for me to get the product is to long. So I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
    <li> They are the same quality as the name brand. I will continue to purchase these as long as they sell them here. Now I can change the brush monthly with out the guilt of the price!</li>
    <li> The inner ring of bristles has no play/movement when you attach it to the clarisonic so when you turn it on, the experience is NOT correct. Sort of half power/half speed.  These were a bargain, but they do no work.</li>
    <li> After I put this brush head on my Clarisonic, it stopped working.  There&#x27;s a reason why these are so cheap!</li>
    <li> They fit the Clarisonic system I have.  The only comparison between these and the original Clarisonic brush heads is that these brushes themselves do not feel as stiff as the originals.  Who knows what that means; might there be a difference in effectiveness?  No clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they are much, much cheaper.  Given the substantial price difference, they were worth a try for me.  But I cannot vouch for their effectiveness in comparison.</li>
    <li> these are great! they work just as well as the name brand, at a fraction of the price.  i love them and recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> shipping took quite a long time, but the product itself work well in my clarisonic pro. i compared it to the original brush head that came with and despite different colors, i really couldnt tell a difference in the bristles. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I was willing to pay the name brand their outrageous price for these!  These fit my Clarsonnic perfected and work as expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement head.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price! I do feel like they wear out a little faster than the name brand ones, but at this price you can definitely replace them without feeling like you&#x27;re kicking your wallet!</li>
    <li> they look the same as the clarasonic heads, and are the same size and fit, but -and this may just be my mind playing tricks on me- it definitely doesn&#x27;t FEEL the same.</li>
    <li> Fit well...very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love these! Wish I would have known about this awesome value sooner,</li>
    <li> it is not for sensitive skin, it will scratch your skin</li>
    <li> Clearly a fake,very soft brushes.  They don&#x27;t last as long as the real clarisonic heads. However, they still work decently.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than original brush heads and work fine. They are softer bristles so they don&#x27;t give as deep as a clean, but that means you just need to do an extra wash and you&#x27;re good to go. For the price, they are definitely worth it because they are practically the same. Haven&#x27;t made me break out or anything, been using for about a month. Fit on my Clarisonic Mia just fine and haven&#x27;t seen an issue with mold</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile. After I purchased my Clarisonic, I looked into their brushes but when I found out there were $25 a piece, I was like no way! After reading all of the Amazon reviews, I decided to purchase these replacement brush heads. They&#x27;re okay, you definitely get what you pay for. It&#x27;s definitely NOT the same as the OEM brush. I actually like the OEM brush much better because it&#x27;s denser? and really lathers your face wash which means that it removes more makeup residue. I don&#x27;t like how the brushes feel on my skin and I feel like the bristles on the brush feels flimsy and feels like it doesn&#x27;t get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this brush definitely splashes and splatters onto the sink and my bathroom mirrors if it&#x27;s not directly flat on your face. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase anytime soon. I have 3 more brushes left to use. They&#x27;re durable and last a long time though and for 4 brush heads, the price is definitely affordable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these compare to the brand name brushes. I found myself breaking out after using this for a couple weeks. When I changed brushes, my skin cleared. Again, 2 weeks later I broke out. I believe that they hold more bacteria than the brand name. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Just like the originals!</li>
    <li> The bristles on these feel softer than the Clairsonic brand brush heads but these generic ones feel great in my skin and the price is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Brushes we smaller and softer than expected</li>
    <li> Works as good as the clarisonic brand much cheaper</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work as well as the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; brand, to be expected. I still use them, but they slip off every so often.</li>
    <li> fit perfectly and work great</li>
    <li> after I use this brush. I can def. feel that these r not authentic.</li>
    <li> 1 star only because  I have to. Don&#x27;t fit the claisonic. I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> Cheap brush head and doesn&#x27;t feel good on your face.</li>
    <li> Fits fine and nice to have a less expensive option, but the brush quality is also less - bristles quickly feel stiff.</li>
    <li> Exactly the same product you&#x27;d buy as a replacement at Macy&#x27;s for 5% of the cost!! Great product</li>
    <li> The quality of this product left me smiling a little brighter!</li>
    <li> Works exactly the same as name brand brush heads.... Just WAY less expensive</li>
    <li> I will be the first to admit that I wasn&#x27;t changing out my brush heads enough because they are EXPENSIVE---so when I saw the four pack of normal heads for a steal, I figured there was nothing to lose.  They are GREAT.  I feel like they work just as well.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with water splashing--same amount of foaming action.  I won&#x27;t be switching back.</li>
    <li> Says it ships Prime. Shipped from China and once it got tot the US it was 2 day Prime after that! Quality is not as good as the real thing.</li>
    <li> It makes total sense that you can buy a 4 pack of these for 6 bucks. I&#x27;m not being sarcastic, they are literally a brush, with a plastic base and bristles. Clarisonic would have you believe the bristles are made of unicorn hair making a price of $25 for one brush justified, but in truth it is a simple thing to manufacture and one is as good as another. BUY THESE instead of the brand name ones, it almost seems like it should be illegal to charge what they do, and the only way we win is to find another option!</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever and at a great cost.</li>
    <li> Legit! I was skeptical because of the price. Yes, shipping takes a while. They&#x27;re coming from China! Worth the wait. They work just as well as the original Clarisonic heads.</li>
    <li> i love the opal&lt;br /&gt;keeps blood flow to under eye area, also eradicates any rough areas.&lt;br /&gt;I had a scaly patch for years on under eye area (cheekbone) and dermatologist said only lazer would remove it, but the Opal took it away.</li>
    <li> Worth the price. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> The fact that people pay the normal price for the Clairsonic replacement head, baffles me. These are perfect.</li>
    <li> The are not worth the purchase.  The bristles are very harsh and my Clarisonic did not it them well. You&#x27;re better off buying the real thing.</li>
    <li> These are a generic version, visible the moment I saw the packaging.  I had to throw one away immediately as it had an awful odor.  They took weeks to arrive from China... that was my 1st giveaway.  I&#x27;ll purchase replacements from Sephora from now on to be certain my expectations are met,</li>
    <li> I normally get the brushes from my dermatologist at $25 a pop. Wow these brushes are EXACT. Dont hesitate...get it.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I expected and delivery was quite quick.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes just like the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t spin or rotate like the brand name brush head does. I tried all four in the pack with the same problem. Then I put back in the old name brand head to troubleshoot, and it worked fine. So I&#x27;d stick with the name brand here.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Not like the original brushes. Too weak and it doesn&#x27;t scrub well. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> They work just as well as the higher priced brand brushes.</li>
    <li> Good price and nicely made. Works fine on the machine while saving me money. Love it!</li>
    <li> These work great to replaced the old brushes</li>
    <li> They feel exactly like the brand name heads. Why have I been spending so much!?</li>
    <li> they work exactly the same</li>
    <li> Some of the heads were damaged and bent;(</li>
    <li> Pros: it fits onto my clairsonic, the price!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it can&#x27;t compete with clairsonic brushes&lt;br /&gt;I was enticed with the price too, who wouldn&#x27;t be?  And I thought the brushes were fine, until I started losing interest in my daily clairsonic routine (which I love). Because it wasn&#x27;t working. The brushes don&#x27;t lather up very well. Maybe because they are longer?  Or silkier than Clairsonic brush heads?&lt;br /&gt;Either way- they do not compare. When I switched back I saw an immediate difference. My skin got that fresh tingly feeling like the first time that used the Clairsonic?  Remember!?  Don&#x27;t waste your six bucks, or go ahead- it&#x27;s just six bucks, but you&#x27;ll throw them out.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very comparable to the name brand replacement brushes!! Shipping was fairly quick. I bought these to fit the Clairsonic Mia 2. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Beware! These are not Clarisonic. They took over a month to arrive. They are very scratchy and hurt my skin. I have to throw them all away and buy the real deal.</li>
    <li> A generic that is definitely not as good as the much pricier brand name one but will do.</li>
    <li> At first, I really liked these and thought they were indistinguishable from the authentic Clarisonic replacement heads. However, over time, I found these knock-offs to be harder on my skin. They started to feel rough. Also, over time, they developed a bad smell. I replaced the first one and tried the second one in the package, and it developed the bad smell even faster than the first. I originally recommended these, with a five-star review, but I&#x27;ve changed my mind. At this point, I don&#x27;t even use my Clarisonic because the brush heads feel so uncomfortable. I have to decide whether it is worth it to keep buying the full-price ones though. I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought the Clarisonic that it would become such an investment, as far as the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Seem to be the same quality as the Mia brush heads and fit perfectly well, and I can&#x27;t tell a difference in the texture.</li>
    <li> They are a perfect fit for the Clarisonic Mia 2.</li>
    <li> So far no trouble. I did notice a few more breakouts then normal but only for a week, now I love them and they clean easier</li>
    <li> This is junk. It doesn&#x27;t work with the Clarisonic Mia.  Do not waste any money on this.</li>
    <li> The middle of a brush head was broken in the package so I am down to three. otherwise seems fine.</li>
    <li> I always order these for my Clairisonic. They work just as well at a fraction of the cost. I tell everyone I know about them.</li>
    <li> Great purchase four were included in the price.  I love the Clairsonic</li>
    <li> Yes, the brush looks the same and fits the Clarisonic, but the brush doesn&#x27;t actually oscillate, which defeats the entire purpose of the Clarisonic. Super disappointing and pretty much worthless.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Save your money.  So rough.  Thought I&#x27;d save a few dollars and get these ones, but only used once and didn&#x27;t again.</li>
    <li> These work GREAT! They fit perfectly into my Clarisonic MIA2, they are almost an exact dupe, and just a fraction of the price of the original Brush heads??? I love these!</li>
    <li> wow what a deal !!  these brushes are just as good as clarisonic.  I will never pay the high price for a brush again.  this company is great and I hope they stay on amazon forever. many thanks</li>
    <li> these arrived ahead of schedule. They fit perfect. Good quality bristles also!</li>
    <li> Why pay more for the same item.  These are more cost effective and work great.  Try them you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just like the real thing!</li>
    <li> Excellent price and quality. Was surprised they are actually clarisonic name brand brush heads</li>
    <li> Warning! If they do not fit properly you can not get a refund. They dont do returns!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend much money on these b/c they don&#x27;t feel the same as the original Clarisonic Brush Heads.  These knock-offs have shorter bristles and seem a lot rougher than my previous brush heads.  I had to stop using it and go back to my old brush head.  I have used knock-offs in the past, and haven&#x27;t had any issues, but unfortunately I could definitely tell a difference with this batch of brush heads.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly on my clarisonic and work just like the expensive ones you buy on sephora! Will definitely repurchase when I need more!</li>
    <li> These seem to work just as well as the $27-$32 Clarisonic brush heads.  I really don&#x27;t understand why the Clarisonics costs so much when these seem to work just as well.  Only giving 4 stars because it took a bit longer to receive the product ( I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered them that they were shipping from China)</li>
    <li> These DO NOT work with clarisonic! Don&#x27;t bother buying, waste of money! I hate to spend so much on the Clarisonic brand of brush heads but these are clearly no replacement!</li>
    <li> A bit more rough than original , not as tightly packed bristles, good for price, I&#x27;d buy again</li>
    <li> Works just like the original</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered these!!!  They are the exact same as the ($25 each) replacement for my clarisonic mia.  Shipping was very fast!!!  :)  Very Happy!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly same with original clarisonic one.</li>
    <li> Awesome deal!  The heads fit in mia 2 great - very happy with the purchase.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Did not fit my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to spend so much money any more with the clarasonic brushes this does the same thing for you face, i highly recommend the product</li>
    <li> Works with the same as the Clarisonic heads with a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews for the generic brush heads. I was on the fence about ordering but I figured if I spent $6.95 and they were horrible at least it was only $6.95. When they arrived I compared them to my Clarisonic brush head. Looked the same and the texture of the bristles felt the same. That night I washed my face and it felt exactly the same as the pricey replacement heads!! So happy with my purchase! I will order again and I&#x27;m telling everyone who will listen to order!</li>
    <li> i have the clarisonic mia and i use the delicate brush normally. I found this and was amazed by the price. The brush fits the mia but it doesn&#x27;t have the same affect on the face. I tried it on my hand to see what is the difference as well. I used the original delicate brush from clarisonic and it spins stronger than this &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush head. it does spin but i am not sure why it doesn&#x27;t spin as strong as the clarisonic ones. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> I did not think that bristles of the brush were too rough, what I did notice is that they may be just a little too long or that they are too soft. It arrived on time in good condition. I will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> These replacement brush heads were a great price and worked very well.  Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell the difference between these brush heads and the more expensive version.</li>
    <li> FIts and works perfect for Clarisonic</li>
    <li> Entirely too soft, even for my sensitive skin - barely took my makeup off.</li>
    <li> Just like the real thing! May be a knock off of the clairsonic but works just as well!&lt;br /&gt;Will never go back to spending $15 for a brush head.</li>
    <li> Does not feel anything like the Clarisonic brushes which have longer more pliable bristles.</li>
    <li> waste of money, they didn&#x27;t fit. Never again.</li>
    <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t believe how long it took me to think of looking for generic brushes for my Clarisonic. These work absolutely fine. I have noticed the extra noise that some people noted but, honestly, for the price...not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have nothing against Clarisonic. I love the device but after paying their prices for replacements for some time now, I have no qualms about going generic. After a while, $22 bucks a pop just seems like greed on the company&#x27;s part. They might want to rethink their strategy. If the brushes were under $10 each, most people probably wouldn&#x27;t bother looking for an alternative. But at $22 each...we&#x27;re bound to take our business elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Bristles are a little rough and stiff, would try the sensitive brushes next time. But these are an awesome deal!</li>
    <li> These brushes don&#x27;t work &amp; I think this seller is taking advantage of buyers! I just received my final shipment of brushes (from Hong Kong), &amp; tried them.  The first one screwed on ok, but that&#x27;s about it.  None of them work properly in my 3 month young perfect original Clarisonic.  The brushes are also not what they should be i.e. the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush has far less bristle strength than my original Clarisonic Brand &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; brush.  You can&#x27;t depend on any of them to work or be the correct bristle strength. Because of the poor fit none of them vibrate using the sonic function which makes them useless.  They are basically a brush screwed onto your Clarisonic buzzing without any power.  After about 30 seconds my Clarisonic began making a strange low pitched noise.  I was afraid of doing damage to it, so I quickly tested all of the brushes, found they were all doing the same thing, then I stopped &amp; never plan on trying another.  Naturally I tried my original brushes &amp; thankfully everything was still in working order.  Also, what is truly disturbing &amp; I don&#x27;t understand how it can be ethical, I bought all of these thru OrganicMed, based on reviews about them, but all 3 types of brushes I bought were shipped by different companies &amp; different addresses with different return policies. This one came from Omeya, &amp; they gave me a partial refund.  They said I could keep the brushes &amp; partial refund providing I give them a 5 star rating!  Are you kidding me?  The nerve to even ask!  They can keep their money &amp; I&#x27;ll be able to warn you instead! I&#x27;ve already alerted Amazon &amp; they&#x27;re investigating this also.  More disturbing news is that I just did a search using my original order #&#x27;s &amp; the items were again listed by OrganicMed but they were now being fulfilled by a completely different company!  How can this be right?  I bought my brushes from OrganicMed but they were sent by 3 different companies.  I suspect they are manufactured by 1 entity &amp; sold to the othersthat in turn sell for whatever they can get.  The defects were all the same from all 3 distributors &amp; that can&#x27;t be a coincidence.  So please be careful &amp; if OrganicMed is mentioned as a seller DONT BUY THESE BRUSHES!</li>
    <li> These brush heads are better than the Clarisonic ones, I believe. I obviously don&#x27;t know if technically or in terms of quality of material they are better, but I have definitely seen better results with my skin since using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also rinse clean and fit perfectly. If you are looking for a good substitute for a great deal, these work. Also, they shipped really fast.</li>
    <li> it fit my clarisonic perfectly and works just as good as the original brand.&lt;br /&gt;like all the other reviews, i thought it was too good a deal to be true but i figured $6 was worth the risk..&lt;br /&gt;it works and i&#x27;ll be buying more from here!!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moP6HA5WS9HA8R]]Just like other reviewers, I was skeptical at first because of the price.  But, I am glad I made the decision to try these out. I was just not in fond of paying 26$+ for a Clarisonic brush! Although these are from China, I received them within 2 days! Whatttt?  Super fast shipping. The brushes were in individual boxes, and four boxes were wrapped in a plastic bag.  I&#x27;ve provided few pictures for this product.  When I first opened it, the brush head looked and felt like the original brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are few things about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Brush part is longer than the original one&lt;br /&gt;- Brush is soft and good quality&lt;br /&gt;- The back part of the head is gray not white (picture)&lt;br /&gt;- A little difficult to put the head into Mia.  But it&#x27;s not impossible.  Once it&#x27;s in, you can use it like the original brush head.&lt;br /&gt;- When operating, the brush head moves a little, but it doesn&#x27;t come off.  It is latched to the Mia, but it will move a little when you touch it.  But you can use it without a problem. Video is attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, give them a try :)  If you don&#x27;t like, simply return them.  Amazon has great return policy/</li>
    <li> They are just as described.</li>
    <li> The brush head is supposed to rotate and these do NOT.  Since that is one of the main features of the Clairsonic system this just isn&#x27;t an acceptable option if you want to keep those pores nice and clear.</li>
    <li> These knock-off clarisonic brush head do indeed fit my clarisonic. They lock in and vibrate just fine. However, the bristles are about 1mm longer than the bristles on the clarisonic brand brush heads, so the vibration is not nearly as effective and makes the brush head seem much softer. They aren&#x27;t the worst, but I&#x27;d rather spend the money for the real thing. They should look into shortening their bristles, then maybe they would be a decent alternative.</li>
    <li> Takes awhile to arrive, but a terrific bargain. I put on on the Clarasonic yesterday, seems to work fine. Will update if any problems.</li>
    <li> What a savings and they are just like the originals.</li>
    <li> Fits my Clarisonic Mia perfectly. Brush heads are a bit more stiff than Clarisonic normal brush head. All in all, they work great.</li>
    <li> Similar to livered as described I had a schedule.</li>
    <li> Fits my Clarisonic Mia perfectly- can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the Clarisonic brand brushes.</li>
    <li> I tried these out because they were so cheep and everyone in the reviews really seemed to like them.  I switched back to the original brush heads made by Clairsonic.  They just aren&#x27;t the same.  It seemed like they were rough in my skin and sprayed water everywhere.  Maybe because the brush is slightly longer...  Also, I noticed them smelling funky really quick.  I wouldn&#x27;t waist the time unless you want to wait a whole month to get your order.  They ship from China...  I say no more.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly. It&#x27;s exactly the same thing that came with our clarisonic</li>
    <li> I always thought the OEM Clarisonic brush heads were way overpriced. But after buying these generic brush heads, I&#x27;ve realized you get what you pay for.    1. They don&#x27;t glide on the skin as well as OEM brush heads. I wet the brush head and put a dollop of cleanser just as I did with the OEM brush heads. The OEM brush heads would produce a rich lather and the brush felt like fluffy velvet oscillating over my face. With these generic brushes, the lather is minimal and it feels like the brush is DRAGGING on my face. Like if you would take a piece of rubber and try to move it over your skin, it drags rather than glides. One of the reasons could be that the bristles are longer than OEM.    2. They spray water/cleanser outward when the Clarisonic is momentarily being held away from the face. It sprayed on the walls around my sink.    3. They tore the skin around my nose and mouth apart. I noticed peeling, redness, and flaking within days after beginning to use the generic brush head. I got 1-mm white bumps in the crevice on both sides of my nose. They were like whiteheads, but I would pick them off and they would come right back. I eventually figured out that they were overgrowth of skin because of how much skin these generic brush heads was removing. The redness and flaking were so unsightly, I tried to take off the dry skin flakes with tweezers but my skin would start bleeding. The skin around my nose and chin was cracking and it would burn when I put on moisturizer. It was an frightening experience. I stopped using the Clarisonic and although it took 2 weeks to fully heal, these problems disappeared. Went away completely.    For now, I&#x27;m taking a break from my Clarisonic, but I know it&#x27;s not the fault of the machine - it worked fine for me for 2 years before this terrible experience.</li>
    <li> These did not live up to my expectation, unfortunately.  The price was so low that I took a chance, especially in view of many good reviews.  However, the brush head scratched my skin and left the surface very rough and uncomfortable.  I would not recommend these at all.</li>
    <li> They work very good, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT.  Easily as good as the Clarisonic ones</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! I put off replacing my Clarisonic Mia brush heads for nearly a year because I didn&#x27;t want to pay $27 for a new one. It was far past the point of needing a new one when I happened to check Amazon to see if they were any cheaper than Sephora. I cannot believe I didn&#x27;t think to check on here sooner! These things are identical to the much more expensive Clarisonic brand. I will continue to purchase these brush head as long as they are offered!!! Mind is blown!</li>
    <li> These heads I got as replacements for my Clarisonic. While I have no problems (yet) with the actual quality of the product, the bristles were much softer than the equivalent heads from Clarisonic (I ordered the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;) and I don&#x27;t feel as though they give the same quality cleanse.</li>
    <li> The brushes we received were fake.  My wife compared them to the original one that came with the machine, and we noticed the quality for these replacements were far worse than the one that came with the machine.  Plus, the color was not pure white; we saw some black spots on the brushes.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to clarisonic brand brush heads but for a fraction of the price.  I installed one onto my Clarisonic brush without any problems.  It was easy to put on, and I have used it for about a week.  It functions just like the old brush head, which was original.  I will be ordering these each time the brush head wear out.  The only noticeable difference between the original and this one is simply the color of the base of the brush head, which is grey vs white (original).  That does not matter to me.  I love these!</li>
    <li> First, very quick shipment considering they come from China. What is even more amazing, they are CLARISONIC brand! I put it on my Clarisonic Mia and they worked like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely wonderful value for Clarisonic branded brush replacements!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the price</li>
    <li> Awesome value for Clarisonic Mia replacement heads.  I just paid $28 for a single head at Sephora and these perform the same way.  This goes to show you that buying name brand is often funding big budget marketing campaigns...if it wasn&#x27;t for the big campaigns, I probably never would have bought a Mia in the first place but I&#x27;ll take the value brand any day to save a buck!</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace my expensive Clarasonic brush heads. So far they work good, you really can&#x27;t beat the price. I don&#x27;t use a traditional face wash but instead oil cleanse so these cheaper brush heads will be great to have.</li>
    <li> These fit well ,work great . Looks like the $25.00 replacement  brushes. Shipping takes some time ,but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t fit my ProSonic.  Luckily I was able to return them</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Fast, professional transaction, thank you!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! U get enough brushes to last for over a year. Each brush is supposed to only last up to 3 months unless u take SUPER good care of them</li>
    <li> These did not work at all.  In fact, they moved just a tiny bit but a second later it made a pop sound and sat lifeless even though my Clarisonic kept vibrating away.  Complete waste of money &amp; time.</li>
    <li> Product was awesome! I got a year supply  if brush heads for under 6 bucks! But keep in mind skipping took over a month, since it&#x27;s coming from China.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for here. The brushes are obviously cheaply made and the bristles are easily bent. It also seems to collect wht I hope is soap scum and not something worse in the bottom of the bristles which is GROSS!</li>
    <li> just like the actual clarisonic brush replacements but exceptionally cheaper.</li>
    <li> A++++++ great alternative to the very expensive name brand! Fast shipping and product was as described. I would definitely purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Very poor choice to buy these!&lt;br /&gt;They do not rotate and when they rich your face, it is rougher than original.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t distinguish these from the brand name.</li>
    <li> Disappointing the middle of the brush head doesn&#x27;t move at all</li>
    <li> The brush heads work perfectly.  I wish they were a bit more &#x27;firm&#x27;, as I remember the actual Clarisonic brand replacements are, when they are new.  I might invest one more time in the actual replacement to compare.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even tell the difference. Will be ordering again! What would have cost me $100 was less than $10. And for those that ask yes there are infact 4 brush heads with 4 brush caps</li>
    <li> Not nearly as nice as the real heads!</li>
    <li> These brush heads will do in a bind, but I can definitely tell the difference between these and the name brand. These are not as soft.</li>
    <li> These fit my Clarisonic Mia so I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> These fit my Clarisonic fine, but the brushes are much too soft.  Therefore, I do not feel I am getting an effective and thorough cleanse.</li>
    <li> These brushes are satisfactory - the comparison between this set of brushes and Clarisonic brand is very close....not sure if they will hold up and last as long.</li>
    <li> Technically fit my Mia 2 but didn&#x27;t work. Very mild, ineffective vibration. Had to toss them and buy new ones elsewhere.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great price compared to Clarisonic brushes. I give it 4 stars only because these brushes are slightly different in feel but they get he job done.</li>
    <li> Did not fit my Clarisonic Pro and got stuck when I tried to put it in.</li>
    <li> Just amazing!  What a price for 4 replacement heads that fit my Mia perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m coming back for more!</li>
    <li> Exactly as ordered and priced just right</li>
    <li> No need to buy expensive heads. These are just as good.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic with a much better price tag!</li>
    <li> These are NOT clarisonic and they do NOT work as well as the real thing.  Plus, it takes about 3 WEEKS to get to you.  Just get the clarisonic brand and be done with it!</li>
    <li> They seem softer than the Clarisonic brand, but for the price I paid, I can live with that.</li>
    <li> These heads fit the clarisonic just fine.  The soft heads are really much softer than the name brand Clarisonic so I would order differently next time.  They are well worth the difference in price.</li>
    <li> Awesome alternative to the name brand replacement heads!</li>
    <li> I would not pay $27 again for one brush this does the same work</li>
    <li> Works like the original.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> They work possibly better than the clarisonic brand heads! And a fraction of the price, thank goodness.</li>
    <li> very good brushes for the price. they do the job at half the price of genuines.</li>
    <li> Love my Clarasonic and the brushes are perfect! I feel, in order to thoroughly cleanse skin, having used mineral make-up, this method does the trick.</li>
    <li> The plastic heads didn&#x27;t fit the brush correctly, and the brush material was poor quality. I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> just as good as the original and the lower price is greatly appreciated!</li>
    <li> As expected because the other reviewers said they were very soft and nothing like the Real brushes that come with your Clarisonic. That being said I still feel like my skin is cleaned and for the price I really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> These are not at all like the originals. The bristles are much longer and they hurt!!</li>
    <li> great product same as paying the  big money at department stores</li>
    <li> I only received two brushes when I should have received 4. The brushes work, I just didn;t receive the whole order and have been unable to resolve.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The bristles of the normal brush head are softer than those of a worn-out, OEM sensitive brush head. Rubbing my face with a Kleenex tissue would exfoliate my skin more effectively. The brush heads are manufactured by GreenInsync.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work on my Clairsonic. Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> I had trouble with acne but after I got the Clarisonic Mia for my birthday it cleared up completely. When I bought these replacement brush heads I didn&#x27;t realize they were off-brand until I got them. They were so much cheaper that I hoped they would work out anyway. I used them and my skin went back to the way it was before I even had the Mia so I will NOT be making that mistake again.</li>
    <li> These brushes seem equivalent to the original Clarisonic brush at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic, but hate the high cost of the replacement brushes. This used to mean that I used the brush heads until they were practically falling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these on a whim, figuring I wouldn&#x27;t be out much if they didn&#x27;t work or last as long as the originals. Much to my surprise, they are sturdy and feel good on my skin. After one month, I see no wear on the bristles. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Cheap, but no comparison at all to the real brush heads. The fibers are way too long and soft. When I use the real brush head, my face requires very little moisturizer afterwards - it soaks it right up. Not the same with these. I don&#x27;t get that great scrubbed clean feeling and the moisturizer does not absorb as well. They don&#x27;t seem much better than using my bare hands. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these. I really hoped that I would, because of the great price, but they&#x27;re just too scratchy! It hurts to use them, and I can definitely tell the difference between these and the real clarisonic brushes. Just buy the real thing. I can&#x27;t stand to use these.</li>
    <li> Just like the real thing only much, much more economical.</li>
    <li> awesome well worth the cost, the same as the high priced &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; work just the same</li>
    <li> These brushes were terrible and by no means a replacement of the real brushes.  It is tempting since they are so cheap, but it will tear your skin up.  Do not buy these!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was generic, no wonder it was inexpensive. Good value for the price, but quality not the same as the brand.</li>
    <li> Fits , good material, great price</li>
    <li> A little to soft of a brush for me but I still use and like them.</li>
    <li> Works just as well at the brand name ones!! Wish I would have found them sooner.</li>
    <li> These are great and just as good as the name brand but with a much better price for what their worth. Will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I was a bit concerned that these replacement brushes wouldn&#x27;t fit my clarisonic mia 1. They fit just fine! They are a little softer than the original- even softer than the original set I purchased for sensitive skin. It did take a few weeks to come in, so order before you need them. For this price, you can&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for Clarisonic Mia 2 replacement heads!!!  I will order them again and they work perfect!!! I have looked several places and these were the best price for the value and quanity.</li>
    <li> I bought these replacement brush heads for my Clarisonic Mia since the Clarisonic replacement heads were so much more expensive.  These &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; my Mia, but I had to fiddle with it quite a bit to get it to actually &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; - meaning the brush head didn&#x27;t actually move, vibrate, sonic, nothing, when the brush was initially turned on - and even then, it didn&#x27;t stay in place for the full cycle (probably because the thing is vibrating at sonic levels?!) so it basically defeats the purpose of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles were soft and the construction of the heads seemed perfectly fine, and like I said they do fit ON the brush, but since they didn&#x27;t really work WITH my brush, I can&#x27;t give a good rating right now.</li>
    <li> Thank the stars for this knock off Clarisonic replacement brush heads! I hated paying so much for just one brush head, but now I can buy four the even less than that! I compared the brushes themselves to the Clarisonic ones and they feel the exact same! They are super soft and install the same too.</li>
    <li> Order from them about once a year. Always good.</li>
    <li> Very hard bristles, this hurt my face. Nothing like the real brush replacements. I would give 0 stars if I could. I actually used 1 to clean my shower, it was that stiff!</li>
    <li> This replacement head fits my MIA, but brush is a bit longer and softer than the expensive brand. It&#x27;s okay but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> These do not work with my clarisonic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the quality and feel of the brush head, it&#x27;s just like the original! I&#x27;m really happy with how affordable it is. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Does not fit the Clarisonic Mia properly.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers were correct, this brush develops mildew/mold very easily even if you rinse it thoroughly and allow lots of air circulation while drying. These brushes made my skin break out terribly, and the mold was so bad I could smell it on the brush. The brushes look like they are identical to clarisonic brushes, but they are clearly made with inferior materials. After several uses on the first brush, I threw away the other three. Waste of money, buy the real thing.</li>
    <li> For the price, totally love this. The bristles feel a little softer than the brand name ones, but I admit to comparing it to an old one that needed to be replaced. My logic is, the sonic waves are coming from the handheld device, not the brush head, so I think this works. I have the original Clarisonic and these brush heads fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly with my clarsonic brush device.</li>
    <li> Once again.....thought these would never arrive!!!</li>
    <li> These work just like the more expensive Clarisonic brand brush heads!! I&#x27;m so happy I discovered them.</li>
    <li> These worked great and provided the brush I needed</li>
    <li> These are rough and are a lot harder on my skin than the name brand brushes.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> A great deal for these brush heads! It took awhile to receive it but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Great price on these replacement brush heads for my Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my scrubber and way cheaper than name brand</li>
    <li> For the price I thought I would give these brushes a try.  I&#x27;m happy that I did.  I found no difference from the original Clarisonic and they fit perfectly.  I will definitely order them again.</li>
    <li> These were a great price, but an awful product.  The good news is that they fit perfectly in my Mia 2, and had no odor.  The bad news is that they were nothing like the original Clarisonic brush head.  The brush is actually much softer, but was very irritating to my skin.  After using it, my face had red blotches and burned.  I requested a refund, which was granted immediately.  I will continue looking for a way to purchase the Clarisonic brush heads at a discount, as they are greatly overpriced.</li>
    <li> What a bargain compared with the store price for the Clarisonic skin care brush replacement. Highly recommend it. It fits perfectly and feels the same to me.</li>
    <li> Works like the manufacture brand</li>
    <li> Works great with my Clarisonic Pro.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> These are the exact brush heads sold at Sephora to fit your Clarisonic....but at a fraction of the price! I use the Mia if that makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get ripped off by Sephora or anywhere else for a little plastic brush head....buy it here first!!!</li>
    <li> Has more bristles than the Clarisonic brand brush heads, so it&#x27;s more fuller. The stiffness of the bristles are about the same. The quality seems to be as good as the official brush heads. I&#x27;ve used these replacement heads for a few weeks now and I gave the other two I gave to my girlfriend. We don&#x27;t notice any difference except having a smaller hole in my wallet! It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> The brush heads fit with out problem and work just like the ones that came with the device originally.</li>
    <li> Majority of customers like this 4 pack replacement Normal Brush Heads, however, the video did show that the brush heads center does not move. Also, a few customers complain about their brush heads starting too smell and mold which cause the customer to purchase a Mia again. I went to the Clarisonic site and ordered the 2 pack for $44 instead of $54 with free shipping. Yes, the cost is more and less brush heads, but in the future I will not need to purchase another Mia due to brush heads not fitting properly onto the Mia causing water fill up which will cause molding.</li>
    <li> Works just like the original Mia heads.</li>
    <li> Great buy and they work perfect.  The brushes fit the device perfectly and the texture is exactly the same.  I highly recommend these and I will purchase them again.</li>
    <li> I see no difference in these brushes and the ones they are charging 25$ a piece for.</li>
    <li> Bristles seem about a millimeter longer than the Clairisonic original. other that that,fits and works just fine.</li>
    <li> These are amazing ! They fit perfectly into my Mia ! Defiantly recommend !</li>
    <li> Why pay $$$$ for the real replacement heads!? These attach perfectly and work just as well as the real deal. I&#x27;ll buy these over and over.</li>
    <li> love this brushes. I would order it again. highly recommend</li>
    <li> Am I the ONLY person that found the brush heads faulty? Water seeps under the brush, stays between the brush &amp; device which I didn&#x27;t realize until my Clarisonic began to smell.  I removed the brush head &amp; found the inside to be black, moldy &amp; disgusting.  I cleaned the device for 2 days using alcohol &amp; Q-tips.  The process took 2 days because there were several steps involved AND I needed to make sure the device was completely dry before cleaning it out more.&lt;br /&gt;I developed sores on my face just before I noticed the horrible smell.  I thot perhaps I had bug bites or acne.  But because the raised painful red lumps on my face didn&#x27;t go away with any acne type treatment, &amp; I also didn&#x27;t get any more &amp;#34;bug bites&amp;#34;.  Before I realized I actually had an infection because of the pain &amp; definite signs of infection, I was going to use the brush again.  Now I won&#x27;t risk using the brush heads &amp; I need to purchase a completely new system because I can &#x27;t be sure ALL the mold is out of the device.</li>
    <li> These brushes were not regular as advertised, but had the softness of the brushes advertised for sensitive skin. Waste of money and of course I am not going to bother to send them back to China.</li>
    <li> I will continue buying my replacement heads from this seller! They fit my Clarisonic perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very reasonably priced and I use with my Clarisonic, perfect fit!</li>
    <li> Exact same brushes that came with the Claire Sonic. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed by these brush heads! I was hesitant to purchase, thinking they would not meet my expectations. The brush is so soft and fits my Clarasonic Mia 1 perfectly. I will never purchase the expensive Clarasonic brush heads again! These are a great dupe!</li>
    <li> These are great! I have a supply for an entire year!! The price is unbeatable and unremarkable! Took awhile to arrive, about 3 weeks, but understandable since it came from China. The bristle are soft and it fit my clarisonic great! I&#x27;m buying more as stocking stuffers for my sisters!</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE! Brush is VERY soft- more soft than the 3 month old brush head from clarsonic. AND IT DOESNT SPIN at all! WASTE OF MONEY. Nothing compared to these positive reviews I&#x27;ve seen here and nothing compared to the clarsonic brush head.</li>
    <li> These brush heads fit my Clairsonic Mia just like the name brand brush heads do.  Great deal.  Bristles are the same texture. I have no complaints, especially about the price.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase.  Makes no sense spending more $ for something when you can get basically the same item for less.</li>
    <li> This product is not like the Clarisonic heads.  The bristles are rigid and feel way too abrasive.  While using it, it causes tiny splashes of your cleanser, which will get in your eyes if you&#x27;re not careful.  Really uncomfortable to use.  I threw them away and ordered the real thing from Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Very reasonably priced!  I&#x27;ve moved from a sensitive brush to a normal brush head.  Both my husband and I love the normal brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these so much cheaper then the real ones and I feel these work just as well if not better.</li>
    <li> Why get the expensive ones when you basically can get 4 for the price of 1 original? The brushes are grey instead of white and the bristles are actually a bit longer, which I like because they are softer and hold more product on the brush when in use.</li>
    <li> So far brush one works great</li>
    <li> Works well on my ultrasonic..and is a good price compared to other brands..I&#x27;m waiting see how long it takes before replacement..I&#x27;ve learned you get what you pay for..</li>
    <li> Terrific deal.  Work just as well and last as long as official brush heads.</li>
    <li> Just like the original more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> These are just as good as the ones you purchase in the store. I would buy again and tell others.</li>
    <li> The brush heads fit the clarisonic great, however they are a little bit softer than the clarisonic brush heads.  Good deal for the price, but may not be quite as effective.</li>
    <li> great price. happy consumer. good service. speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> Great product, original</li>
    <li> Work just as good as the real most expensive version.</li>
    <li> I have a Clarisonic Plus and these fit and work perfectly.  Thank you, thank you Amazon and OrganicMed for allowing me to spend about $1 dollar a head instead of the ridiculous $27 price on the brand site.</li>
    <li> Nice just soft so not sure they are legit.</li>
    <li> great buy. fits perfectly</li>
    <li> These replacement brushes fit the Clarisonic very well. Great value! I was skeptical about purchasing them because the price was so low. They are very slightly softer ( which I perfer). Due to being shipped from China, delivery time was somewhat longer than for most Amazon orders.</li>
    <li> Great price and they work! Not quite as good as the Clarisonic ones but gets the job done for the price.</li>
    <li> Not the same as others I have ordered. Hope they work as well and last as long</li>
    <li> Not sure I&#x27;d buy these again.  Just isn&#x27;t the same as the name brand. Bristles are super soft leaving me to believe my skin isn&#x27;t be as exfoliated.  Will get the job done.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for the Clarisonic Mia and others.  Excellent quality.  Unbeatable price-point.  Super-speedy shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> For the price these are fantastic.  There was no way I was going to spend brand-name Clarisonic price on a new brush.</li>
    <li> This works well with our Clarisonic! No problems at all and a good clean face!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!  I use these on the Mia Clairosonic 2 and they work just as well as the name brand replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!!! Just like the originals but way cheaper!!! Fast deliver (I have prime).</li>
    <li> After taking more than a month to arrive - these brush heads did not work with the Clarisonic brush - it grinds and makes noise but did not turn at all - I got worried that it was harming the brush motor so I just threw them away.  I would not buy this product again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> Seem to work just as good as the Clarisonic brand however the makeup residue sometimes stays on the brush. I have tried washing them with a cleanser that is supposed to remove and clean makeup, but the bristles are stained with orange makeup. I don&#x27;t feel like my face is getting the clean that it should. Maybe i should just spring for the more expensive brand brush heads then the cheap copy.</li>
    <li> These work fine but are very soft, I prefer firmer bristles</li>
    <li> Exactly the same as the name brand... priced so I can afford replacing them on a regular basis!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit in my mia 2.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes, not love them. But they get the job done that&#x27;s all that matters. They are soft, almost as soft as the real ones. I bought these cuz who gone buy the real brushes for $25! Not this girl! lol..... Anyway these brushes are aight. It came in a pack of four, so they will last you probably a year or so. The plastic is a little harder then the real ones, but they fit the clarisonic great.</li>
    <li> These definitely fit my Clarisonic Mia 2 and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.  But I will not be re-ordering.  For one thing, though they do fit onto my Clarisonic Mia, they are actually larger than the Clarisonic brush heads--the brushes themselves are taller and more dense.  It feels like a medium stiffness doll&#x27;s hair brush.  I have been using the new brush head for several weeks now, hoping to get adjusted, and it still feels wrong and is more irritating (and I am not typically sensitive-skinned, I normally like a little abrasion).  Also, when I started using the Clarisonic in 2011 I suffered from occasional but horrible breakouts, and in the years since I have completely cleared up except for times when I am unable to use the Clarisonic--like when I would keep forgetting to charge it (that was mostly in the early days, now I can&#x27;t live without it) or when I go on vacation and forget to bring it.  Well, since using these new brush heads, I am completely broken out. Nothing else in my routine has changed, so I can only assume it&#x27;s the brush head. I know these are way cheaper but I wouldn&#x27;t have bought such an expensive device if I didn&#x27;t expect to pay more for the benefits, and for me the benefits aren&#x27;t there when using these brush heads.  I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell the difference between these and the crazy expensive ones you have to buy at the medical spa. It did take about three weeks to get them, so plan ahead!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the brand name, fits perfectly and gets the job done. All that at an amazing price!</li>
    <li> Feels softer than the original but for the price it&#x27;s hard to argue.  It works...so I guess that&#x27;s good...</li>
    <li> I like these but my  facial girl said that one is too harsh for me I should have gotten the softer brushes.</li>
