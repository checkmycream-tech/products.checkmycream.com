<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I notice a little change in my skin, will keep using.</li>
    <li> My skin is usually kind of dry and it&#x27;s been on its best behavior since I started using the serum!  I love it :)</li>
    <li> Not my favorite serum.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but I do expect a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any change in my face&#x27;s complexion after two weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed in the results and the price I paid for it.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working ok. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference but I do see more clear skin. However I do use prescribed retinae cream so the combination of both are working.</li>
    <li> I have noticed an improvement in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me</li>
    <li> Works great!  Smoother skin and reduced pores.</li>
    <li> This product is the first one I have used where I saw visible results...and in a very short period of time. I use it on my face every night and it makes my skin feel soft, smooth and very nourished.  My fine lines have definitely diminished and it also evened out my skin tone (and lightened a dark sun spot I had on my face). I use it on my hands as well. I love that it is so natural and such a healthy product for my skin. My skin definitely looks healthier! (The customer service is also great.)</li>
    <li> Really helps with the small lines, especially around the eyes!</li>
    <li> This stuff rules. My aesthetician approves and that take a LOT. So far I love the hydrating oils and the fact that the % of niacinamide is right on the bottle. My skin is glowing :-)</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I am loving the Niacin amide Serum. Just that clarity of my face, smaller pores, plumpness and yes a noticeably appearance!&amp;#34; Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Truly has made a difference. My husband asked me if I had had a &amp;#34;lift.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This serum has given me such great results! I&#x27;ve been using it every morning and evening after cleansing and after 3 weeks really have seen such a dramatic improvement with my skin&#x27;s texture and overall youthful appearance. This is definitely going to be a mainstay in my bathroom cabinet. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product - My skin looks flawless. I never had any big skin issues - no lines really - my problem is brown spots. I think that they are lightening.</li>
    <li> Really good product showing a notable difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> In LOVE! I have been in the skin care business and I hope others introduce Niacinamide Vitamin B3 to their skin care!!</li>
    <li> It has plumped my skin and help calm my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a very soothing serum. It feels very good and I think it is helping my skin to heal although I have only used it for one week. I am going to keep using this. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The Amazon customer reviews were helpful. It was well packaged and arrived on schedule.</li>
    <li> Product smells good but I havent seen any visible tightening as promised. Would not by it again.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped on time. Packaging as represented.</li>
    <li> Shrinks pores for sure but idk about the rest</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 66 with good skin - use C and retinols on my face and eat well etc etc.  But seemed like my face was looking &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34;  - bought this because of a tendency to redness but find after about two weeks that my face has (1) much better all over color and (2) a slight &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that I am very happy about!  It&#x27;s well moisturized also.  I am very happy with this and will be buying again - I will also keep using the C serum and retinols with it.</li>
    <li> One of the most amazing products i have ever used. My skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I rarely leave a review, but would like to say how pleased I am with the serum! My skin is smoother and some discoloration has vanished. I&#x27;ve always had problem skin and have tried so many products over the years. Happy to say that this one works. Period. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  I typically buy very expensive skin care products, but this one little bottle proved to me that I really don&#x27;t need everything else I was buying. Very little gives great moisture and the price is very nice.</li>
    <li> This product has visibly tightened pores and reduced fine lines. My skin looks softer and smoother.  This product has worked better for me than any other products that I have tried. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I rate the product two stars, because it did not cause me any ill effects. However, I also noted no benefits after using the entire bottle once daily as directed.</li>
    <li> I saw an instant difference with this product!  I didn&#x27;t expect that!  I have used it for almost two weeks now and My face is smoother.  I had only crows feet but they are far less and my pours are smaller and my skin just glows. I am extremely impressed. I will stay on this serum!&lt;br /&gt;My other recommendation for glowing skin is unprocessed coconut oil.  That tightens skin as well.</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves skin moist ,smooth and not greasy. U will like it</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin looks and feels smoother and has less redness in just a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this Niacinamide serum. Works fantastic along side of my Retin-A, which used to leave my skin reddish and inflamed, forcing me to limit my use to only 2-3 times a week.  With the use of Niacinamide serum I can use the RA nightly now and have been doing so for many weeks with no problems.  I&#x27;ve used RA for 27 years now and no other lotions or potions have worked to tame my skin until somebody on a skincare site I visit recommended this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered my second bottle long before I need it, but I don&#x27;t want to have to miss even a day of use. Great stuff. Non greasy, works fine under makeup too.</li>
    <li> I have been applying the serum twice a day (morning and night). During the first week, I was applying all over my face and neck as well as hands. Now that I only apply around my cheeks where the sun damaged patches are alongside other products, such as vitamin C (20%) and Retinol as well as whitening face mask.   You got to rub in the Niacinamide Vitamin B3 on those affected areas and wait for about 5 minutes before applying any other products. You will definitely notice the difference  I can see visible improvements in my skin tone. My entire face looks bright, pores are almost invisible and the sun damaged patches look much lighter now after 3rd week. So are my fine lines.   Everything takes time. Therefore, be patient, stay positive and use this serum religiously.  These are really my personal unbiased comments for whoever has the same problem and unsure if you should give it a try. Now, the answer is &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;.  Regards,</li>
    <li> It was making the lines on my face deeper and the skin appeared even saggier.  Did not work for me. This was after two days it was looking worse.</li>
    <li> I found that after 5 weeks, the product plumped the wrinkles for a smoother younger effect.</li>
    <li> It has faded my post acne marks far quicker than it would have on its own. I don&#x27;t have breakouts so I can&#x27;t be descriptive to how it&#x27;ll work for that besides fading the blemishes. I don&#x27;t really see tightened pores, but I&#x27;ll continue use and see if there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
    <li> Great product. Have seen improvement in texture and skin plumpness.  You will notice improvement after using only a few days! I use on face and neck area. I avoid using on oily nose area. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I find that my skin has a much finer texture (in only 15th days) and closed pores in the area of the nose. I continue to use it to see more great results.&lt;br /&gt;I like the product.&amp;#34; Thank you!</li>
    <li> I live in Wisconsin where the weather has been frightful  We have had extremely cold temperatures day after day with wind chills reaching -30.  I have been using the serum for a little over two weeks now.  Normally in this weather my skin would be very dry and tight feeling.  The wrinkles would be very pronounced with more forming from the dryness.  I am pleased to report that my face is soft and dewy looking. and that is no easy feat for a 63 year old woman with dry skin.  I have given it 4 stars so far and if I continue to see improvement I will raise that to 5 stars.  The only drawback is a temporary sticky feeling that goes away as the product goes into the skin.  The company that produces the serum are very nice and helpful and they impressed me.</li>
    <li> My daughter tells me I look younger.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any results as yet.  Too soon to comment on its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I recently was searching the web for a product for my dry, flaky skin hoping I could discover a more natural course of care than a dermatologist. I found an article on Niacin &amp; B3, so I went to Amazon, because I always find what I need here, and I found Niacinamide Vt. B3 Cream Serum two weeks ago. I ordered and got delivery within two days.&lt;br /&gt; I love the serum, and have experienced relief from dry patches on my cheeks, around my nose and forehead. I am a 66 year old female on limited income, so this is a great find for me, it is very affordable. I also have been bothered for over a year with dry, cracking, painful build up skin on my chest, and have been relieved of a most of it already.  Also, I recently started using it on the back of my hands for dryness and dark spots too, with great results. So thank you Skin Daily Skincare Solutions I look forward to purchasing again soon.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, so I have to be careful what I use on my face.  But I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions whatsoever and my skin is so soft and supple.  I&#x27;m so surprised at how quickly I can tell a difference.  I use it at night before moisturizing.  I also use Retin-A on the nights that I don&#x27;t use the Niacinamide Serum, which can tend to dry my face, especially in the winter.  I use the Niacinamide 2 nights in a row and then the Retin-A every 3rd night.  I believe the serum is keeping my skin moisturized, but not greasy.  I really am very pleased with this product and will keep it in my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two weeks and I LOVE IT! I have spent $120.00 on serums because I now have very dry skin, and this one is better than the $120.00 serum. The product comes to via Amazon no shopping, do waking in to stores that are tying to up sell you all their products. It is simple, easy, convenient to use and affordable!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I am starting to notice plumpness and a smoother texture.  I have had a friend, whom I haven’t seen in a while, notice a change also.  I have had no negative issues with Skin Daily Serum and am happily continuing its use on a daily basis.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My skin is dry, and slurps this stuff up like crazy.  I wonder if it&#x27;s ok to put hylauronics&lt;br /&gt;on top of it though. I think my already smaller pores are invisible!</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother after using this and looks more even</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. My skin drinks it up smooths your wrinkles tones down that extra baggage under the eyes I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I have very sensitive and dry skin but this serum brought back my youthful look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not sure I see a difference yet it has not been a whole month, even though I warm it up in my hands like directed it still stays a little tacky</li>
    <li> It dint do anything as it said .&lt;br /&gt; i bought this for my pores basically and it did not tighten my pores or reduce the size . i have been using it 2 times every day and no result .&lt;br /&gt;i have a combination to oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for about a month. Within a few days my 18 y.o. daughter commented on how good my skin looks. I am 55 so compliments about my skin are welcomed! I noticed a difference right away after using the serum. As a user of Dermalogica for many years, I know good skin care products. I&#x27;m still using Dermalogica but this serum fits in well with their products. I had one problem a couple days after I started using it, which is that I started to break out. I stopped using it at night and that solved the problem. My skin seems to have adjusted because after I month I tried using it at night again and I haven&#x27;t had any break outs. This is a great product and they have fantastic customer service. They actually follow up with you personally to see how the product is working for you. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working. I will buy it again when it&#x27;s out.</li>
    <li> Great!  I have only been using this product for 2 weeks and am hooked.  I&#x27;m already starting to see plumper more hydrated skin.  I also believe that is already starting to improve skin texture and tone.  I will update in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great light moisturizer but I haven&#x27;t seen any amazing results.</li>
    <li> I love the way this glides on- feels nicer than other serums that I have tried and I see results. I heard about a study that was done on Niacinamide- which is what made me look into this in the first place. Glad I did- and GREAT customer service !</li>
    <li> Does not cause breakouts.  Helps supply moisture to skin and soothes redness.</li>
    <li> Have purchased twice, going to my third bottle, Iam 53 years old, working full time mother of two teens, boy n girl, not much time to spare on my skin care routine, need something that shows results and not expensive. I am going through my changes and sometimes hormonal acne was still in the picture, never let that bother me much, because by now i know its temporary, also had brown spots from too much sun through out my life, had used all kinds of promising creams and little has helped, not with Niacinamide, I use twice daily, mixing into my morning and night cream, 2 pumps only each time, it had made an incredible difference in my skin clarity, tone, firminess and hidration and my hormonal acne &amp;#34;GONE&amp;#34;.....I don&#x27;t normally post reviews about anything &amp;#34;guilty&amp;#34;, which i should, it was reviewing postings that i&#x27;ve found this miracle skin care or my fountain of youth....literally</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> really helps in reducing my overly large pores</li>
    <li> This has really helped my skin and I&#x27;ve ordered my second bottle and will continue using this. I had a history of breakouts and this has truly minimized them.</li>
    <li> Good but not seen such improvement in my skin</li>
    <li> I have only used the product twice, it seems to be doing what it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I will update in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Yes and Yes!  I need to order more soon! I love this product!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I read that this product is being used by make up artists on their movie stars clients and decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days and my skin feels softer and moisturized. Excellent customer service and communication/recommendations for use from the company owner. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed I have not seen any changes and use the product every day.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. Since using Niacinamide Serum I have noticed that the brown spots on my face are paler and my skin overall is brighter. My pores are tighter and less noticeable.</li>
    <li> II ordered it to use as eye serum and love it so far. Unlike other product, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and small amount is sufficient. I am planning to their otherroducts as well!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any huge improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple moisturizers over the years and this one is my all time favorite. I tried it because I have the beginnings of rosacea and I read that niacinimide cream can help with the redness, which had been getting worse and worse. Not only did this dramatically reduce the redness, but it definitely makes my skin look younger, lines less visible. It is not greasy at all. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now, and this is one that really does make a difference.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. I have noticed some improvement.</li>
    <li> I use this serum in conjunction with other products.  I can see a difference in the texture of my skin.  Do read the directions as using less is better.  I warm a pea size amount in my hands then apply to my cleansed face.  I&#x27;ll wait about five minutes or until I know this product has been absorbed into my skin before using a moisturizer.  I can see a visible difference in my skin - it&#x27;s evened out my skin tone.  I was also prone to an occasional break out, and have not had that happen since using this product.</li>
    <li> Really good product.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  I am a runner and lines show on my face easily.  I hadn&#x27;t found such a reasonably priced serum that really worked until now.  Thank you so much for this great skin care solution!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this cream. I feel like it enhances the effect of my retinol cream. I plan on buying again- very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I like it.  Have not seen any big improvements, it&#x27;s only been a few days.  Feels and smells nice, not oily and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now, and I have noticed a great improvement in my skin. The tone is clearer, my skin is plumper and smoother, and problem acne areas have cleared up. I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and have oily skin, with hormonal acne and sun damage (who knew about sunscreen in the 80s?!). I&#x27;m grateful to have found a product that is affordable and that also is improving my skin - I feel much more confident in my appearance since I started using this Niacinamide Vitamin B3 Serum from Skin Daily Skincare solutions.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Especially for the price.  You need very little.  If you have very dry skin you will need a moisturizer over it.  Highly recommend.  And I have used much pricier products.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference- in a lot of areas to be honest! My skin tone and texture has improved. My acne has decreased. I feel like very bring is much more balanced topically. I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> I have used about half the bottle....I use it morning and evening....This is a very nice serum ...it softens skin and actually does slightly reduce lines....My skin has a more youthful, dewy look......I will purchase it again....It works as good or better than expensive concoctions sold by celebrities.....</li>
    <li> Works well I&#x27;m 44 it smooth and tightens your poors it&#x27;s not heavy at all. I have told friend about this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and I&#x27;ve notice a big difference on my skin,,  my next order will be two bottles so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Love it for myself, and I recently gave some to my husband to put on the precancerous areas he gets on his face (that has had treated with freezing in the past). This lotion seems to calm the redness and make them less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Thank you MiSS Morgan! This product is AmaZing! Finally something that works and dont clog pores or cause breakouts. This is a must have! Will be a lifelong buyer. You must try ,you&#x27;ll love it :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since April. I really like it. I am 64 years old, my skin in good condition. I use this along with Renova at night. I put on the product first and then the Renova. When I travel I just use the Niacinamide to keep my life simple. It is not a miracle drug but what I do see is a clearness to my skin, pores and it seems to have kept my skin in good shape as I have begun to stop all my other very costly creams so I am happy with that! In terms of hyperpigmentation - that is my only bane of exsistence with my skin - happening on my left side due to driving. Eavery year I go to the dermatalogist and get zapped and while it is better it will never be perfect. I have not seen a change with the Niacinamide but then again I feel that no product can do everything and even with Fraxel, and other zapping the hyperpigmentation doesn&#x27;t seem to want to leave my lovely face:)! I am beginning to embrace it!</li>
    <li> Excellent serum for sensitive skin made with high quality, natural ingredients. Restores moisture, soothes skin and improves texture. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and normally I would have to slather my skin with so much lotion that I looked oily. People would think I was hot and sweaty and it was just all the oily lotion I would use.&lt;br /&gt;I put this product on first and wait 5 minutes and then apply  CeraVe SA on over it (lotion of choice) and that is all I use.  I apply my normal makeup and my skin is soft without looking oily. All day soft.  Amazing for me. I started noticing an improvement in my lines around the eyes within two weeks. The company sent me an email with directions on how to use the product which I appreciated.  I will keep this product in my regime.</li>
    <li> Make sure you wait about 5-10 minutes after using this before moving on to your next step, because it will pill up and flake off. It&#x27;s a great product, though.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;My skin feels softer and smoother even after our cold winter. Since I am not finished with the first bottle, I am looking forward to more improvement.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Almost one month now, &amp; incredible changes. After a harsh winter no product I had would take away that dry rough red patchy skin. From the first use, I knew it was different. I used it faithfully morning &amp; night &amp; my skin feels as smooth as silk. Dry rough red patchiness totally gone! Skin is plumper. Getting many compliments, which is really great because now I use this mixed w/a liquid self-tan bronzer. I have no need for the foundation anymore. Sometimes use a little pressed powder on areas that tend to get shiny on steamy summer days. No more clogged pores from foundation! I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled w/this product, I can&#x27;t be w/o it now!</li>
    <li> very good serum. very good for my sensitive skin. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The Niacinamide Vit B3 serum is a quality product. I am using once a day (thought D n N is fine), and I have noticed that my skin has a more youthful look to it. The price is fair and the service was great. Keep up the good work, don&#x27;t inflate the price, and customers will keep you in business. Thanks much.</li>
    <li> Using the Serum is part of my daily routine. I always apply before shaving. I think it is the plumpness that makes the shave go so smoothly. After shaving, I add a little more and lightly massage my cheeks and forehead.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and really worked on my sensitive skin however it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my early results.  Very effective in reducing open pores.</li>
    <li> This product leave a sticky feeling on my face, and it also cause my face to breakout and very oily.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I am hoping that the longer I use it the more improvement I will see. As you stated in another email it took a lot of years to get where you are and be patient for best results. Right now I am not using any other moisturizers other than yours because I have no need to.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> After a week of using this serum my 65 year-old face feels softer and more hydrated.  In fact, wherever I put the serum, the skin feels more supple.  A big help for a crepey neck and  wonderfully good for my lips. So far so good.  I will monitor age spots etc. The effect the serum has on my lips is remarkable.  You only need a very little bit to do your face, neck and upper chest.  The serum is very emollient. It has absolutely no smell.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it every morning and my face has started to look more youthful.  A nurse at my kids pediatrician office complimented me on how great my skin looked!  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Acne was the first result of using this. I think it uses a plastic type ingredient to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; moisture in. Great idea. Not so helpful.</li>
    <li> Just the vitamins  my under eye  area needed  to take away those pesky wrinkles</li>
    <li> This seems to work great!</li>
    <li> I like to try new beauty products. I usually buy them online based on customer feedback. For the B3 Serum I can confirm the positive reviews of others. Within a couple of days of applying the serum I feel my pores have decreased and my skin looks cleaner with a nice, healthy glow. Its definitely worth 5*.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time to write a review but I can say this serum works so far for me . My main concern was the effect that can has on my adult acne problem after my dermatology suggested to take B3 as supplement I checked about this serum due to its ingredients and I can say so far it works ! Plus they have pretty good customer service that cares if the product works for u or not .</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product daily. I put on my sunscreen and then apply this serum....wait a few minutes for it to dry then I apply makeup which goes on smoothly. Or if I go without makeup I feel confident that make skins looks its best.</li>
    <li> I think I can see results after 1 week.  I&#x27;ll need to revisit this in another week to know for sure.</li>
    <li> Twice a day has eliminated much of the discoloration from post-acne and sun damage. I wish I had known about it years ago.</li>
    <li> Slowely aee the result, will continue using it</li>
    <li> I really like how this product brightens my skin. Great product have already purchase another bottle!</li>
    <li> Great - seems to smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product! This is my second bottle! Amazing customer service... If you have questions they answer them quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff, I&#x27;ve seen improvements but took at least two weeks of daily application.</li>
    <li> Good product but doesnt absorb enough for my choice.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that I will continue to buy and use! This is a must have to continue having that youthful and healthy complexion we all want in later years. With continued use I have seen a dramatic reduction in fine lines, and pore size. The texture of my skin has evened out as well.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;All I can tell you is that out of the blue, after using your product for about a month, one of my friends told me my skin looked RADIANT.  So that speaks volumes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So i did an unintended experiment when i first began using this...i have really sensitive skin and break out really easily so i started using it on my forehead only for the first few weeks to see if it would break me out. I saw and felt a noticeable difference between my forehead and the rest of my skin. I noticed only the smallest difference in fine lines but i did see a difference. This stuff moisturizers like nothing I&#x27;ve ever felt though, i don&#x27;t even put on any lotion on top of it like it suggests. I love it just like it is. I also noticed my skin feels tighter and my pores do look slightly smaller (I&#x27;ve always had a blackhead problem on my nose so there&#x27;s only so much it could do). Anyway i love this so much in buying 4 more right now 2 for me and in giving 1 to my mom and 1 to my best friend. Btw, for those who are interested in ages this is best for,  i would say all but I&#x27;m 35...fyi. i officially feel like an infomercial now but this product deserves the raves and long review!!!!</li>
    <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve noticed using this product is my skin is finally hydrated. I live in Colorado where it&#x27;s very dry and have tried many skin care products from many different companies. This is by far the best one for my aging skin. Friends have commented on how good my skin looks!</li>
    <li> Effective and deep moisturizer, definitely helps with skin tone and hydration of sensitive areas around the eyes and I use it for my lips too. Due to my skin structure and tissue density, only highly concentrated products work well on my face.</li>
    <li> seems to be working alright not sure what i&#x27;m looking for</li>
    <li> I like how simple the product is to use, and how much smoother the lines are around my eyes and mouth.</li>
    <li> you can buy this exact serum from a company called Essential Wholesale - 16 OUNCES for $22.....yeah, SERIOUSLY!  UPDATE: A couple people say my review is not helpful, hmm.. Lol,  maybe I did  not  make it clear enough :  THIS IS ONLY 1 OUNCE.  ESSENTIAL WHOLESALE SELLS IT IN A 16 OUNCE SIZE.  DO THE MATH.</li>
    <li> Amazing product with immediate results! This serum worked better than every other serum I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s light and feels nice on my skin. Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> This brand is definitely the best of the competing products I&#x27;ve tried with the same or very similar formulation - most noticable results and goes on smoothly with no stickiness. Nice people at the company, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Dermatologist products, pretty much any type recommended for aging skin. Gave this product a try but was not impressed with it at all.  I can&#x27;t see any difference in my skin...no visible tightening of anything!  Sorry...just my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. Not sure yet how well it works, but I love the serum texture, and how it disapates with a light clean feel, and not think and greasy. I&#x27;m haven&#x27;t been using it consistently,  like I should. But I would order again.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of use seems to be having a positive effect on skin clarity.</li>
    <li> so far i love this product i have been using it for almost a week now and i can actually start to see a change for the best in my skin. I purchased this product because i wanted to minimize my pores so far so good. also it has made my skin look younger shipped super fast as well i received this product two days after ordering.</li>
    <li> Since I use it my skin is really improved..</li>
    <li> I am over 68 yrs. and I like any product to help in slowing my aging complexion, or at least helping my skin look healthy.  I do have brown spots and WHEN I wear this product with my sunscreen, I see the spots lightening, especially when I keep my face out of the direct sun.  Not such an easy thing to do in South Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it feels on my skin and I am not as consistent using it as I should be, so I feel it is doing a good job in spite of my personal negligence.  I do believe it minimizes wrinkles especially the ones over my lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do see it has tightened my pores and I hope to be better at applying this serum consistently.  I am now keeping the serum on two bathroom counters since I love it and ordered another bottle once I had the first bottle.</li>
    <li> I have not been as diligent with applying the serum as directed, but thus far have noticed my &amp;#34;T zone&amp;#34; pores tightening and diminishing in appearance. My skin tone as a moderately fair skinned red head that worships the sun more than she should was blotchy with freckles and never quite went from a sun kissed red to tan, but after hit and miss application of the serum I have noticed my face losing those freckles and withholding a nice brown skin color and not so much a redness. While I am only 26 years old, my skin carries more of the appearance of someone who is in high school now and the faint &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; I was acquiring due to prolonged sun exposure are less visible. Which is fantastic and no longer requires the attention of foundation or contouring, thus making me extremely happy cutting down on my face prepping time for the day. My cases of adult acne and scarring are also becoming less visible, adding to my satisfaction of the product. I am very happy with my purchase and intend to continue using it! I do not notice any unpleasant scent nor does my face become oily and feeling sticky. The minimum amount required for proper application is quite pleasing as well given the fact a single pump is all that it requires to cover my entire face as well as neck. The customer service and support was extremely wonderful to work with regarding any questions you may have with their product!</li>
    <li> I have been using many different creams and lotions over the years, including one brand from France that is highly recommended and reviewed but also highly priced, but I have never had such an immediate noticeably positive change in my skin until I tried this Skin Daily B3 Cream Serum.  My skin is smoother, dewy and when I have the beginning sign of a pimple or blemish, this B3 serum immediately gets it under control. Lines and dark patches seem to be disappearing as well. I have bought a bottle for my fiance and two bottles for my mom.  Very thrilled to find such a great product at such a great price.  Wish I had found this a lot sooner!</li>
    <li> It may be a little early to write a review as I only got it 4 days ago, but it hasn&#x27;t given me any breakouts on my acne prone skin and I&#x27;d swear my pores look smaller.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It has made a very positive difference in the look and feel of my skin.  My skin is smoother and softer.  My son commented the other day that skin looks brighter and healthier.  i&#x27;m in my early 60s and still have oily skin.  Finally my skin has balanced out and is no longer oily.  i intend to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last three weeks, it is amazing and I believe has taken 10 years off my face. I use it under my moisturizer every morning, try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> clears pimples while leaving skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> My skin has not looked this good in a long time!  This serum gets absorbed rapidly and leaves my skin smooth, soft, blemish free, and seems to be diminishing fine lines around my eyes.  A little goes a long way, so when they advise using a pea size amount in the Directions, that is accurate.  Using that amount, the product is rapidly absorbed and not greasy at all.  Before using this serum, I would dread going public without foundation makeup.  Now I look pretty good using just the B3 Cream Serum and a little powder.</li>
    <li> Make my skin looks fresh and soft.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to see any changes after using this product for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> The company was very nice in reaching out to me several times sine my order and for that they should get a 5 star rating but the product didn&#x27;t work on my skin and I could only use at night because it seemed to never fully soak into my skin.  Honestly the only way to fix skin is from the inside or more invasive medical procedures</li>
    <li> This product is excellent ! Very happy with it . A little goes along way, moisturizes and holds moisture in. Not greasy, absorbs quickly. Perfect for under makeup or with out. Plumps skin up and has made it more even.</li>
    <li> Does feel great...and I notice my skin has less visible pours!!will by again..</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s effective at smoothing facial skin without any side effects I have i encountered. I will reorder.</li>
    <li> I like so much this Serum Niacinamide Vitamin B3. I used this product (and still using) around 3 weeks and now i can tell this Serum is really works!

    <li> Surprisingly, using this on my face was on par with high-end expensive serums I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  It plumps my skin, made it silky smooth, and decreased the fine lines very quickly.  Customer service is top notch too.</li>
    <li> been using the product close to a month and I have notice the following changes: my skin feels smooth and soft, the fine lines are fading slightly. I have big pores on the T zone on my face so the change are really slow.  I do know it takes time to see changes, and it&#x27;s there. I am also trying to see changes on my neck area - since I lost a lot of weight, my skin in that area had been loose and I really am trying not to do surgery on it. I did notice that the skin is tightening. Just keep in mind, instant change is for surgery... This is a serum and time had change your skin and it will take time to get results... There are changes that comes with skin aging, it could be a good transition with this product minimizing or erasing &amp;#34;damage&amp;#34;...hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the price!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I’ve now used the Niacinamide for 2 months. I could definitely tell a difference after 7 days!&lt;br /&gt; Wow! I love it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied! I have been using it for two weeks and already see visible results</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and I have definitely noticed a change in skin texture. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because i have only been using it for a short time. In this time I have noticed that my skin is much softer and my pores are visibly smaller! I really like this product and will be ordering more. (Acne prone skin and large pores)</li>
    <li> I have noticed that my skin feels much softer and my acne has become less prominent. My tone is still uneven but it appears to be improving; consequently, I intend to buy another bottle to see if I notice any other benefits.</li>
    <li> I have never tried this product until now but it does work. I have noticed a definite improvement in overall skin texture. I also use it on the back of my hands. I will reorder as well!!</li>
    <li> I just received this serum a few days ago, but so far so good. It leaves your skin feeling moisturized and silky, but not oily. It absorbs fairly quickly too. Also, the shipping was lightning fast and the seller was very generous to already send a note thanking me for the purchase as well as asking how I liked the product. I would definitely buy again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell how well this is going to work however, I have already noticed my skin is so much softer and smoother!</li>
    <li> It took me a while to see the result, yet the result is solid indeed!  Now my skin is soft and supple and the complexion is brightened a bit. I used it at nights and it&#x27;s not sticky with one pump or two ; a small bottle goes a long way.  Definitely will continue using it and update the result whenever needed. ------------------------------------------------------ Updated on 06/04/2015  There&#x27;s one interesting incident I&#x27;d like to report; it might have things to do with this B3 serum........two and half day ago, I&#x27;ve got a small yet striking bruise on the upper left corner of my mouth due to an accident. That narrow and long bruise is so dark and obvious that it looks like I have mustache:(.......I checked online and was told it usually takes about two weeks to see the bruise fade; and some tricks might expedite it to one week! so I applied the B3 serum on the bruise and massaged the area gently everyday since then. And guess what?!  This morning when I woke up, I&#x27;ve noticed the bruise has pretty much faded. You could barely see it without close observation! I&#x27;m so happy about the result for I&#x27;ll be back to my homeland within a week and you definitely don&#x27;t want your long-time-no-see family members and friends to see the mustache on your face :) Very, very grateful with this B3 serum~~~</li>
    <li> I like it, I am sure I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
    <li> Love this product, have seen a dramatic result in brown spots after using this product for only 2 weeks.  Would recomend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not life changing but my skins is clear!!! Makes a glowing look.</li>
    <li> Waiting to see results, probably need several months.</li>
    <li> after two days of using the product my friends started complimenting me on my &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;!!! within the week i purchased a bottle for a girlfriend, she has already purchased a bottle for another girlfriend;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old. Use it daily as part of my regime under make-up. Don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s working but I haven&#x27;t seen new wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My favorite!&lt;br /&gt;It helps with wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Need to use wrinkle cream or moisturizer with it.  This one I will keep on buying</li>
    <li> Been using for a year and I really like this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited to post a review to make sure this product really works and it really does!  My main issues as a woman closing in on 50 and living in the L.A. dry, sunny environment was under my eyes and my neck.  Both areas were getting crinkley wrinkley. My neck was developing a chicken skin texture and discoloration. (I do wear sunscreen) I never use store bought cosmetics/lotions as I appreciate natural, healing ingredients.  I did some research on the healing benefits of Niacinamide for skin.  I&#x27;m just starting my 3rd bottle.  When I began using this I noticed a moisturizing difference immediately, but still had the crinkle and if I put it all over my face, neck I kind of broke out a little bit, not bad, but some red spots.  Almost as if things were coming up from under the surface..purging.  At this point I am so impressed and pleased with how my skin looks!  This is the first review I have ever written because my skin is healing and I want you to know.  Be patient, use diligently ( I use on my neck and under eyes AM and PM, just pea size drop on neck and little dabs under eyes).  Seriously, neck texture is 80% smoother, discoloration 75%gone, crinkley issue 85% better, no breakouts at all.  I feel if I continue to use this, it will continue to heal because it has gotten progressively better over time.  Of course, I&#x27;m getting older, but I&#x27;ve realized that some of skin aging is about the health of the skin and I feel this product heals beautifully.  I do recommend you try for yourself.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this skin care product, particularly because most skin care products don&#x27;t deliver what they advertise.  This one has helped my skin under very adverse conditions - emotional, hormonal, &amp; weather.  In the midst of a move &amp; doing some reno work, this product arrived early &amp; so I used it in the morning. My hands took a beating &amp; so did my eyes &amp; lungs (reno work &amp; dust, etc) but my face was not red or irritated.  Moving items in &amp; out of cold rain yesterday, my face was not red/chapped as it normally would.  Skin is supple, soft, &amp; youthful.  Oh &amp; of course the stress brought on my cycle!  Normally this brings red blotchy skin. This time it was minimal. Wow!  Thank you for a real product with real ingredients that deliver positive results.</li>
    <li> I originally gave this product 1 star and said, &amp;#34;It didn&#x27;t do anything for me.&amp;#34; I found it unpleasant to use during the hot, humid summer. It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me but make my face feel sweaty and I used a tiny amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the weather cooled off, I tried it again, and have been using it morning and night for a few months now. It does indeed make my skin softer, more moisturized and perhaps even more radiant. However, I will stop using when the weather warms up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in here that is making it unusable for me in the heat. A conundrum.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Niacinamide 5% Serum for 2 weeks now and have noticed an improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and clarity.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Niacinamide serum for a few months now and it does enhance my skin, by giving it a smooth and rosy glow. Friends have asked me what I am using on my skin. I prefer your brand as the one I used before felt like I had a coating on my face.</li>
    <li> When I don&#x27;t use this product, my face will break out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks along with the derma wand  and I can really see a difference,</li>
    <li> I saw visible improvement in my facial skin within a few weeks of starting to use it. It works great!</li>
    <li> This product smooths and refines pores so they are not as deep and noticeable. I used this morning and night on a clean face and did not need additional moisturizer. It also smoothed wrinkles and gave skin a dewy appearance.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 3-4 weeks.  I am very pleased the results.  The fine lines around my mouth are gone!  The deeper lines on my forehead are less noticeable.  I have had forehead lines since I was in high school and I am 44 years old now so I never expected them to really improve.  I also had three little hard spots just above my eyebrow.  I would describe them as permanent whiteheads.  Nothing has ever had any impact on them until I tried this product and they are shrinking/flattening to the point of being barely noticeable.  Will definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for the past three months, and have noticed an overall improvement in my skin. I have always had combination skin, with dry patches, but now my whole face feels moisturized from the inside out. My pores and fine lines are less visible as well.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference in my skin texture and how soft it feels.  I have a bit of dryness and red blotchy cheeks, with fine lines.  In the past month since starting to use this along with sunscreen and a moisturizer, my fine lines have smoothed, and my cheeks are much less red.  I haven&#x27;t seen results that I could really pinpoint on a particular product till this one.  Feels good, not oily, and absorbs easily so it&#x27;s easy to use under a moisturizer and under you makeup.  PLUS the customer service was awesome, they sent me a free bottle after I answered an email about how the product was working for me (which I had no idea they would do) the rep was emailing me personally, not an automated system.  That was really cool they check in with their customers and send thank you&#x27;s for just giving a review! Awesome!</li>
    <li> This is the first beauty product that I have used and seen a visible change after just a few weeks.  This is going to be the only cream that I will ever put on my face.  I am sixty-two years and I have always looked ten years younger than my age but this cream has brightened, evened and smoothed my face even more.</li>
    <li> I have been using your Niacinamide B3 and have already noticed a difference&lt;br /&gt;in the texture of my skin. I&#x27;m 65, so your product has it&#x27;s work cut out&lt;br /&gt;for it. My skin feels softer, has a brighter look and fine lines have&lt;br /&gt;already blurred.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  I had been using the Niacinamide B3&lt;br /&gt;with Bearberry Extract for my dark spots. I was a little disappointed that&lt;br /&gt;my dark spots faded only very slightly.  This time I just opted for Niacinamide&lt;br /&gt;B3 without the Bearberry.  I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for making such a wonderful product. I have recommended it to my daughters and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We want you to buy with confidence anytime you purchase products on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com.

    <li> Excellent results from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it to friends&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a vast improvement in the tone of my skin</li>
    <li> Love this product! Definitely works, made my skin smoother and tighter! Will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> outstanding product that i recommend for anyone who wants to look their best with very little effort and product.  Just a small  amount daily does the trick.  I can believe the difference in texture  and even tone.  Face looks fresh and no wrinkles at 58****Definitely my daily moisturizer  as nothing else was needed</li>
    <li> Good results from this product, I use it once a day in the morning, tightness and firmness around the eyes</li>
    <li> Amazing product for an amazing price. Leaves your skin as softest as I ever felt it, clears it up, helps heal the spot and you only need a pea size to make it work so it lasts for quite a while. I am very happy and probs won&#x27;t be using any other serums anymore! Yay for me!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Has definitely made a big difference in the texture and appearance of my skin.  I honestly don’t want to live without it.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and the redness and acne that go along with  it.  After reading about natural treatments, I decided to try this oil, and I love it.  My skin looks better than it has in years, and, as my skin is very dry, I also love the way the serum moisturizes.  I tried this for rosacea, but I&#x27;m convinced it has helped soften my wrinkles especially around my eyes.  Wish I&#x27;d found it years ago!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and amazing customer service. Would purchase again and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it really helps my redness zones on my face and it has helped provide more clarity to my overall skin tone. Just a little goes along way! I recommend this product for folks with oily skin like mine that is prone to some breakouts. It seems to help the whiteheads too!</li>
    <li> I think this product is doing its job.  I have been getting more compliments as to looking younger.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the only product I have ever purchased where I&#x27;ve been given so many compliments about my skin!  In fact last week my husband had a Dermatology appointment and asked me to go with him, when I went into exam room his doctor asked where I get my filler treatments because he knows I am not a patient there. I had to laugh because living in O.C everyone assumes you&#x27;ve had &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; done. The only thing I have ever had is Botox 3 years ago and didn&#x27;t like how it looked on me. Since then I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find a product that hydrates, plumps up the skin and softens the lines on my face and neck. Voila!! This is it!! I&#x27;m proud to say my age is 52, but the doctor thought I was in my late 30&#x27;s ;) How is that for results!! Within literally 24 hours you can see a difference in hydration of your skin. My husband noticed the morning after applying this on my face and said I looked pretty. He never says that unless I&#x27;m all made up with makeup and going out for a special occasion (such a romantic huh??)  Since we&#x27;ve been married for so long he doesn&#x27;t notice a lot of things anymore but he did notice this. Needless to say I reordered more product and hope it&#x27;s never out of stock. Thank you so much for such an amazing serum!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different serums/wrinkle creams with no visible results, but after using this product I have indeed noticed a difference in my skin!  My skin is very sensitive and this serum goes on so easily with no burning, tingling, or redness.  I have been using it around my eyes, which were crepey, and I notice that the skin is plumper and the lines less noticeable. It also seems like the pores on my nose have gotten smaller.  I have very happy with the results so far and I have only used a fraction of the bottle!</li>
    <li> When they say to only use this product once a day they mean it ! I have sensitive skin and on a good day intend to have a pimple or two. I used this product with a hyaluranic acid serum. I would use the niacinamide serum on a nightly basis. Once I saw the positive effects it had on my skin (reduced my pimples) I figured it would benefit me more to use it twice a day. We&#x27;ll that greediness caught up to me because not a week had passed when I started to notice that I was developing acne in the areas where I was applying the serum. I quickly stopped using it for about a week until the redness/bumps disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple weeks later I revisited this product (this time using it only once a day) and found that it does a better job at keeping my 25 year old skin moisturized  better than the store bought products I had been using.</li>
    <li> To date I have not seen any visible results.</li>
    <li> My skin feels more moist and soft after one month of using this cream.  Was hoping that the most noticeable wrinkles would disappear.  (I guess that&#x27;s not going to happen over night or at all.)</li>
    <li> I really like this serum and have noticed a difference in a short amount of time. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about a month or so, and I am so happy with the improvement in my skin.  At 45, I feel that I look younger than ever.  My skin is softer and glows.  I have used other products with Niacinamide for years, but this is the first one that I can honestly say has made a difference.  I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have to say, the serum has helped tremendously. The texture of my skin has improved, the break outs have subsided, and the dark acne scars have lightened up A LOT. I&#x27;m now using for the dark circles under my eyes - it&#x27;s helping...whoot - whoot.&lt;br /&gt;And.. the plumpness... I have noticed my lines are not as deep in the laugh line area and on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I will open my third bottle soon. Funny thing is, my friends as well as my facial lady is trying to get me to  do a vitamin C serum. I did for two weeks - bad idea - I broke out horribly. I went right back to the Niacinamide B3 serum and I stopped breaking out. Soooo happy to found it. I will make sure I never run out!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> my skin its more radiant and my pores smallers love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for approximately one month. I use a pea size amount in the morning and again at night. It has helped with some of my finer wrinkles and seems to be helping the tone of my skin. It is not greasy and seems to absorb well. I will recommend this to my friends and family members.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using the Serum. It is light weight and leaves my skin smooth. I use it every evening after my bath.  Not sure yet about changes in my face  but I like the way my make-up goes on in the morning. So far so good! Also like getting e-mails from company asking how I like the product. Very personal.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! Has helped me immensely with my aggravating adult acne. You only need to apply a very small amount and because I have combination skin, I do not put moisturizer on top of it. Works great!</li>
    <li> Very nice product! It tones wrinkles very nicely. Especially the neck area, forehead, and around the eyes as well! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I am a mid 30&#x27;s female with pale, acne prone skin.  I have been using this serum for about 4 weeks. Ive noticed my skin looks less dull and more glowy and full.  My face looks more alive. Inflammation and breakout have reduced since using this. I will definitley keep using.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. I&#x27;ve been using for a month and have noticed a significant difference in the tone and texture of my skin.  Now primarily use a tinted sunscreen as my foundation because of the improvements.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using but so far I can&#x27;t really tell any difference. Maybe I need to use it a longer period of time. If my review changes, I will repost an updated review</li>
    <li> Such a light non-greasy moisturizer base. Just perfect under makeup!</li>
    <li> There is a lot in this bottle so don&#x27;t be fooled by the 1 ounce.  Niaciamide is one of the Vitanmin B3&#x27;s and great for pore size. My rosacea has calmed down tremendously.since I started using.  If you look at some of the expensive face creams, Niacinamide is usually one of the first 5 ingredients so why waste your money on other products.</li>
    <li> It has improved the overall texture if my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
    <li> Just ordered my second one bottle. Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this product. It seems to be fading my darkspots.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a month. Not a lot of difference in pore size but my skin looks smoother and is soft! Will keep using. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy on my break out prone skin.</li>
    <li> After using the Niacinamide B3 Serum for approximately four weeks, I am starting to see tremendous changes in the tone of my skin. Lines are thinning, pores are shrinking, and my skin color is more vibrant.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I have never found a product that worked so quickly for my skin. I have good skin, I&#x27;m blessed, but I CONSTANTLY take care of it with exfoliation, sunscreen, and moisturizers.  But, because I get HRT (hormone replacement therapy) every 3 months, my face breaks out in the same place every time.  The eruptions are like cysts, they hurt, and they take a very long time to heal.  My facialist suggested niacinimide in oral form, but I had a severe allergic reaction and stopped (in retrospect, I should have worked into it at a slower rate, but because this topical product worked so well, I didn&#x27;t need to). I used this Niacinamide Vitamin B3 Cream Serum 5% and in 4-5 days my face had healed. I&#x27;m talking about some weird type of cysts/pimples that wouldn&#x27;t go away for a month. . . The good news, my pores on my nose also look smaller. I am now waiting for my second bottle.  It goes far on your face, you don&#x27;t need much, but I ran through it faster than I think is normal because I&#x27;m using it on the backs of my hands, arms, and upper chest/neckline area. I&#x27;m amazed at how my skin is looking.  I spend a lot of time, money, and consistent effort to lighten age spots.  This is working well - quickly.  . . .  I&#x27;m excited about the possibilities.</li>
    <li> Great Product...Skin feels clear and smooth.  I would recommend this product to everyone as a supplement to their regular routine.</li>
    <li> love the texture of the Serum, I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks and it seems to be working. I&#x27;ll stick with it and watch for more improvements.</li>
    <li> This really works.&lt;br /&gt;My age spots are disappearing...love the bottle dispenser and a little bit  really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Th size of my pores are decreasing and the price is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
    <li> It reduced my pores in the first application,  And is helping with fine lines and overall health of my skin.  I am very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> I have never liked any kind of cream or moisturizer on my face . I LOVE the way the my skin feels with Skin Daily! My skin is soft and smooth! All it takes is a dab. I am thrilled!</li>
    <li> Really does make your skin smoother and more even. I really could tell a difference in a week or two.</li>
    <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks better and better!</li>
    <li> I really thought this product was going to work. From the very first time I used it I felt something happening. Unfortunately, and it may be because I used other products with it or have sensitive skin, It left me with a slight chemical burn and I had to quit using it. I had to quit using all products to get rid of the red blotches</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum.  For the first time ever, my face looks moist, more vibrant and stays that way all day.  Feels like it&#x27;s getting nutrition.  Got this sooner than expected</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;There is a noticeable difference in my skin&#x27;s texture and it feels  amazing!  I get lots of compliments.  It&#x27;s bright and smooth.  I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> Good quality , will buy again-</li>
    <li> Great product!  My skin is super soft and silky.  I really like it.  I have noticed a huge difference in the texture and tone of my skin.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this stuff!</li>
    <li> Just used it yesterday with super results! Thanks!</li>
    <li> My skin is feeling so much softer.</li>
    <li> So far it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch as so many other serums have. It feels silky smooth and absorbs quickly. I wake in the morning with dew soft skin, and it works well under my make up. I&#x27;ve only had it a short time, so I cannot say if it tightens or reduces pore size yet.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this stuff, but I love it!  I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the look of my skin (but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s there, I am 50), but I have noticed the feel of my skin.  This stuff feels wonderful when I put it on in the morning and at night.  I can really tell it helps with hydration, my makeup even goes on smoother!!  Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few months now and I have noticed a serious improvement in my complexion. I break out far less often and my pores seem smaller. I actually got it for my brother for Christmas since our skin types are similar. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Decent product but nothing major makes it stand out as far as big results. Used it for 30 days. It was just ok.</li>
    <li> I am finishing my first bottle in a few days and ordered my next bottle today!  I do see and feel a difference!  Leaves my face a bit dry on the initial application but within 10-15 minutes everything feels fine!  Nice product!</li>
    <li> I am almost 71 years old and have always looked much younger than my age, until recently as in the last 6 months. I do notice a lightening of the few age spots I do have, that just recently started to show.  Also after rising in the morning, the sleep wrinkles do clear up much faster.</li>
    <li> 4th purchase.  All I can say is everyone who meets me can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m 55  Yep not a winkle or line do I have.  I will continue to purchase. I use one drop each evening before bedtime.</li>
    <li> GREAT customer service!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this serum for your face!!! My pores are way smaller my skin looks and feels tighter also around my eyes are brighter!!! Even dark spots from blemishes are disappearing!!!! I just love it!!!💕 it&#x27;s also great for acne prone skin it won&#x27;t break you out but the serum as well prevents acne flair ups tooo!!!💕💕💕💕will purchase again!!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a topical because of my oily scalp and use a small amount on my scalp.  I noticed the parts of my hair that are thinning a bit looked a little fuller.  No greasy texture and absorbs well.  This is just after a few days I can&#x27;t wait to see longer term results.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I started developing a dark spot on my cheek.  I was less than thrilled.  After using the Niacinamide serum for 3 weeks, once a day, I can see a significant difference.  The spot is almost gone.  During the Holiday season, a friend I had not seen in a while commented upon how youthful my complexion was looking!  Who can ask for more?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll continue using it. It seems to be working!!!</li>
    <li> I have to say I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my pores after using this product I used it before bedtime for 2 solid months and nada. It didn&#x27;t break my skin out and it did seem to be a good moisturizer if nothing else.</li>
    <li> This serum is an excellent moisturizer.  I bought it a month ago, I was only using it at night and saw some improvement in the texture  of my skin but nothing to brag about.  The merchant, Skin Daily Solutions,  sent me an email asking about my experience with the product. I told them I liked the product but I was not seeing big results. They suggested using it twice a day.  I used twice a day for the past week and I am  seeing marked difference in skin texture and radiance. I believe it is fair to give the product at least 8 weeks to see real results with fine lines (my main reason for purchasing it ) I  will reorder and will upgrade the rating to 5 stars if my fine lines improve. Regardless,  as a moisturizer is a five star and I appreciate Skin Daily standing proud behind their product. Stay tuned for future updates...    Update 10/27/2014.   Upgraded to 5 stars. I notice great improvement in my fine lines and skin texture. My pores are reduced. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> My skin looks a lot better. Fine lines are diminishing. It&#x27;s very soft, very little to no breakouts and that&#x27;s rare because I have sensitive skin. My skin tone is looking more even. I&#x27;m loving it so far. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing it again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> like this a lot.  Combining it with Rosehip oil. Put serum on face and back of hands. Wait about 5 minutes and apply oil.  Skin more moist from day one. Texture on hands greatly improved.</li>
    <li> Does NOTHING. Used faithfully for a solid month as directed. SAVE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> Seems to have helped but I think perhaps it&#x27;s an age thing. I&#x27;m no spring chicken and perhaps I expect more. No magic bullet is out there, but I keep trying.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle of the Niacinamide Serum. I really like the way it feels and goes on my skin. I&#x27;ve noticed benefits to my skin such as; softness, texture improvement which make my skin have a youthful glow</li>
    <li> Wonderful product..saw a major difference in firmness, skin clarify,tone &amp; plumpness in few days..better than expensive product purchased from dermatologist..we will never be without this! Thanks to Skin Daily for an awesome product and great service!  it has been a few months now since we started using...continual improvement..look years younger!</li>
    <li> i bought it for its skin cancer fighting properties but it is much more. I am a 62 yr old male and someone asked me if I had botox.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I definitely can tell a difference in the softness of my skin.  I think my pores are shrinking as well.  I really like this product.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> smooth skin after a couple use</li>
    <li> Love this product, I apply it before makeup and with moisturizer - I have incredibly dry skin.  My pores are quite large now with age, but this product helps battle that on my cheeks, nose, chin &amp; forehead areas.  I sleep with it on too.</li>
    <li> Love this too, doesn&#x27;t make me break out or clog pores. Bit I use the skin polisher on here put out but a gentle skin company first that gets rid of dead cells,skin a must. Then after awhile I put this on2 a day at night I use the L&#x27;oreal Paris age hydra-Nutrition advanced. This combo works for me. Try that Polisher I bought it on here make that a 4 x a week thing you will see how your skin is softer then a babies bottom...lol,</li>
    <li> I am giving this 5 stars because of the fast service.  I ordered it and received it the very next day.  I was surprised and very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Skin Daily Niacinamide Vitamin B3 Cream for about one month and really love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  I use a moisturizer about 50% of the time over the cream.  With or without moisturizer, the liquid makeup goes on smoothly.  Overall, my face is more youthful and glowing.  I will continue to use this product which has performed better than I had hoped for!  It&#x27;s too early to tell if the improvement is strictly topical or if the skin cells are being rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> love this,my face feels a lot smoother!</li>
    <li> Keeps skin moist. I have rosacea but this product is non irritating for me.</li>
    <li> It works great! I recommend it for daily use to even out your skin tone and reducing fine lines.</li>
    <li> Been using it for about two weeks and I already notice a difference.  My skin feels less smoother, plumper,  and more even.  Great customer service, they followed up with emails giving tips about proper use and so on.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective good quality product. I noticed an improvement in my skin immediately. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks, and I highly recommend it. I noticed an improvement overnight.</li>
    <li> Worked in one week. It&#x27;s wonderful. My 30 year daughter asked me what  new face make-up I was wearing because my skin looked so good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 9 months and I love it. My skin looks and feels smoother!</li>
    <li> This is another serum that has reduced wrinkles on my face incredibly!</li>
    <li> Really made a difference on my neck.</li>
    <li> This serum goes on so smoothly and I noticed improvement within 2 weeks. My skin is softer, brighter, and feels firm. A little goes a long way and the price was good for the results I&#x27;m getting. I will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> OMG where to begin! I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. My skin....It&#x27;s clearer. It&#x27;s almost porcelain. The pores on my nose are much smaller. The fine lines around my eyes are much less noticeable. The smile wrinkles next to my dimples, so much smaller. I use two squirts, apply around my eyes and apply to my face as well as my neck and decolletage. When doing a skin regimen don&#x27;t forget your neck or decolletage (the upper part of your chest) they can both wrinkle too! I no longer have dry spots on my face, I rarely break out. Redness is gone! I wait 5 mins and I use this under my rosehip seed oil. I&#x27;m telling all my friends! My skin is beautiful. I am 43, this stuff has made such a difference in my skin. I was starting to show my age, this regimen has moved back the clock easily 10 years. I&#x27;m impressed! I noticed a difference after the rosehip seed oil, this just took it up a notch! GET IT!</li>
    <li> Makes my face so soft.Much younger looking skin</li>
    <li> For the price, I can&#x27;t even begin to complain. I get allergic breakouts on my face, and this reduces the redness quite a bit. Enough to justify buying it. It also improves the quality of my skin overall. Took about 2 weeks to notice the difference and acne breakouts go much faster than without, even forming cysts stop growth and flatten in just 2 days while on this. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and have already recommended to several of my friends. I will be ordering another one soon.</li>
    <li> Gret product.  After 3 weeks see noticeable results.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! This is the first cream where I&#x27;ve actually seen results. My pores were huge and now you can barely see them. Lines between eyes from wearing glasses have diminished dramatically. After you apply it on you can feel it working (feels tingly). I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in a while now either. Was skeptical, but glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> Impressive product. It took only several days to help my extremely dry skin to return to good condition.</li>
    <li> I only received this product a few days ago, but have used it every night since then and I am loving it.  It does have a strong smell when first applied, but it hasn&#x27;t seemed to bother my husband or I.  I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed dramatic changes in the last few days but I do feel that the skin under my eyes feel tighter and my skin does look brighter.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Yes, yes! I have noticed my skin is smoother, pores are smaller. A little goes a long way.  Love this product.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> This serum really works. It makes my skin soft and supple. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft. Used only once and now my skin is covered with blemishes. Am trying again in the winter.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and makes me feel hydrated in the AZ sun;</li>
    <li> I love this product ! After only using for almost four weeks I&#x27;m not the only one who noticed that my skin is looking smoother and radiant.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and ive noticed my face is smoother. Its more supple, very youthful looking. Im definitely going to continue with this product.&amp;#34;  4 stars because i wish it came in a larger bottle that i could use on my entire body.</li>
    <li> Works great so far&lt;br /&gt;This with my rose hip oil is A+</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling well hydrated and soft!  Company support is awesome through follow-up emails to make sure you are liking the product and to answer any questions you may have.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle and I love your product.... thank you so much.  I feel like it has helped with the texture of my skin (feels softer) and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m also finding the age spots a little more faded.  Very subtle but I&#x27;m hoping with time, this will keep the age spots at bay.  :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this once daily around my eyes and have seen significant improvement. I have tried other products with very little results. I am very pleasantly surprised and will be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> Great product. Make my skiing super soft and not oily. I can use this under makeup which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I love it my skin feels softer and have beautiful color!</li>
    <li> my skin has improved greatly.  my acne has cleared up and I even feel confident to go out without makeup.. I think my skin looks more moisturized, younger, and doesn&#x27;t look as worn out and tired. Again and most importantly, my acne has cleared, and if I do get a pimple, it heals very quickly and isn&#x27;t as severe/traumatizing as it used to be.  Over the last 4-5 years I believe my skin has aged very quickly (graduate school, a wedding, 2 year old child and no sleep are to blame, as well as harsh facial cleansing products probably), but since using this I have noticed a big improvement. I am also using NiaPads twice a day, and CereVe am,pm, and under eye moisturizers (all contain niacin/niacinamide I think), and the Mia2 Clairsonic with the sensitive brush heads, as well as taking 1500mg of Niacin pills orally. I started using all of these at the same time, since the beginning of August 2014. I stopped using all of the harsher acne and scrub products at the same time I began using the stuff I listed above.</li>
    <li> I have had this product a few days now and really am enjoying its benefits.  I see subtle improvement.  The point is I actually see it.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! The company treats their customers great also! I got many follow up emails asking how this product was for me. I did not want to post right away so I waited a few weeks just to make sure. The first week I noticed a huge difference! It has made my skin so smooth and helps get rid of scars, blemishes and lines. It&#x27;s defiantly worth the try and it&#x27;s not overly priced. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have just used your product for the first time, and I must say that I am extremely satisfied with the results, hadn&#x27;t shaved as easy and painless ever before, you can count with this customer.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s not the first Niacinamide product i&#x27;ve tried but it is the best. I had no idea what Niacin was or what it did for you and I certainly didn&#x27;t know you could apply it to your face. But i read a blog about products that help with PCOS and since I have PCOS and i&#x27;m prone to hormonal acne i certainly took note and came to amazon to look for stuff. I love Niacin products, they&#x27;re great and natural. The last one I used was a spray and while i enjoyed it and it did make my face look bright and clear it did not moisturize like this serum. This stuff is incredible!!! Here&#x27;s my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it did cause me to break out a little. But i think its because i was using this product from Babyface (Pure Bearberry Extract) that is supposed to clear up dark spots. It&#x27;s essentially oil that you drop into your moisturizer and apply to the face. I was doing that after putting on the serum and thats what i did the first week. Once I took the Babyface stuff out of the equation I never had a problem with getting acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away with this stuff you notice soft supple skin. It gets deep into your pores and locks in moisture. its amazing. really. however  i wasn&#x27;t noticing a plumping like everyone was talking about. I almost wrote it off until i used it on my hands and was amazed when they went from skeletor hands (when you have a little one at home you are constantly washing your hands and they get dried out) to plump young feminine hands again! i was floored!!! I said wait a minute, clearly this stuff works, it must just take a while on the face. i&#x27;d only been using it 2 weeks at this point. by the way my hands stayed plump and soft after several washings. so cool! i said to myself, i wish i could bathe in this stuff. lol!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then i read somewhere that in order for cell turnover to show you need to exfoliate the dead skin. so i bought one of those face cleansing brushes (a cheap one) and use it every night. i also bought Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair cream. The combination of scrubbing  the face and using the cream made an instant difference! i finally saw the plumping everyone was talking about! my face looks great!!!! the retinol in the neutrogena has helped lighten up the acne marks from before, slowly with every regeneration of skin they&#x27;re getting lighter. but i only use it 2 or 3 times a week bc my face is very sensitive and it dries me out. but the Niacinamide serum i use day and night and really anytime i wash my face. its so wonderful and gentle and has been taking such good care of my skin. i swear its BABY SOFT!! i will continue to use it forever. its the best everyday care for your skin. if you haven&#x27;t noticed a plumping, try using a cleansing/exfoliating brush and see what happens. i&#x27;m in love with my skin right now. sometimes my hand will brush my face and i&#x27;ll go ooohh wow. lol. also make up slides on so smooth. its awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lastly i want to say the customer service for this company is amazing. i got a personal email asking me what i thought and when i wrote back i got a response right away. just a top notch experience all around. definitely a winner in my book. It&#x27;s inexpensive which is awesome, so everyone can try it and see what it does. a little goes a long way. unless you&#x27;re like me and use it on your hands, elbows, etc. lol.</li>
    <li> I love the product and definitely can see a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG.....I am your biggest fan!  The dark spots on my face have faded to almost nothing, the texture and feel of my skin has improved so much, and I am telling all my friends about your product.  I&#x27;m a 63 year old woman and people in my age group are always looking for that extra little something to help us stave off that aging process.  I think I have found it!!!!</li>
    <li> It really has made a difference on my skin! I&#x27;ve tried many, many products; this one has become part of my daily routine. that&#x27;s a big deal for me.</li>
    <li> This serum is incredible. I previously used numerous topical products on my face and now I only use this. It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer and it also helps prevent acne and even skin tone. After just a few days you start to notice the difference, but after just one use you&#x27;ll feel the difference. If you&#x27;re skeptical like I was, just go ahead and try it - you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Wow! this stuff is amazing. I tend to purchase expensive products and almost didn&#x27;t buy this because I figured it couldn&#x27;t work that good for such a cheap price. I was wrong and am rethinking my belief that &amp;#34;expensive is better.&amp;#34; Brightens and clarifies skin and makes me look like I am wearing makeup when I am not.</li>
    <li> Very important in the potential reduction of skin cancers and reversal of sun damage!</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in my skin right away! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Just received it today. Need more time to determine if it works.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled using this product for only one month. I am no longer having acne breakouts, the acne scars have faded and my jawline seems more defined, overall has a tightening effect. Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Good smoothing for the skin.  Real good moisture.  I do see a smoothness to my skin.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Skin looks like it is better moisturized and more light reflective... bottom line, don&#x27;t see the wrinkles as easily..</li>
    <li> You can see an effect right away and it will probably improve even more with regular use over time.  The cream itself has a very pleasant and high-quality feel on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is also excellent: they immediately sent me a replacement after I notified them that my first bottle had a leak in it.</li>
    <li> I use this serum daily, and I have seen a significant improvement in my skin. It isn&#x27;t nearly as expensive as many of the things I&#x27;ve researched in beauty and anti-aging market. I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> So far I certainly like this product and after I finish the bottle hope to give 5 stars. I am 55 and my skin feels very soft and it appears  that I can see some redness around the t zone calming down . Also some help with the sunspot on my nose. This product is easy to use and I am use it twice a day. Thanks to Skincare daily for making an affordable option!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Niacinamide around a month and a half. My skin is super moisturized and looks younger. My husband also is been using with a healthy looking skin. We live in Dominican Republic with a tropical climate and toguether the sunscreen the results are amazing. I use it up in my hands before bed and looks younger than before. I really love it...</li>
    <li> leaves skin super soft and helps works well with vitamin c serum. My skin seems to be younger looking</li>
    <li> Great antiaging serum</li>
    <li> I have noticed an improvement in texture and wrinkles have softened.  My husband noticed a change (for the better).</li>
    <li> This is definatly now my holy grail serum! My face feels so much softer,my complexion is more vibrant,and it&#x27;s taken away my new acne along my jaw line and this is only my second week.this is a keeper my skin loves it!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and it is working on my skin&#x27;s texture and sagging.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking to tighten pores, rather I was hoping for fading of skin spots and / or reducing fine lines, increasing volume. I guess that&#x27;s too much for such a small price. Added some hydration.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product! My skin tends to be on the dryer side but I get breakouts. This has really helped re-hydrate my skin but without clogging my pores! I love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely  love this product, works great and I will continue  to buy it !!</li>
    <li> I like it i would probley order more when needed thank you</li>
    <li> This is honestly the first time a skincare product exceeded my expectations. Big time. The first bottle was good, but I was using too much of it and it ran out kind of quickly. (The second bottle, I followed the instructions that came in a follow-up email- from the company--(really only a pea-sized amount is enough!)--and it&#x27;s lasting much longer.    I did notice a difference in my skin from the first bottle. It felt more &amp;#34;dewy.&amp;#34; Which is why I reordered it. Maybe it took longer for me to see real results because I am 64 yrs. old, but now I am actually feeling that firmness other creams promise, but have never delivered.  To be sure, I have always taken care of my skin and avoided tanning. (I come from a family that does not have good skin genes. I knew this decades ago from watching my mother&#x27;s skin age.)  So I took precautions. People never believe my age and on a good day I can pass for late 40&#x27;s.  But I know my age and I see the wrinkles. This serum is actually making them WAY less apparent. I don&#x27;t use makeup--except for mascara and lipstick-- and my skin looks very fresh and youthful. More so since using this serum. Who knew that niacinamide is good for the skin?? Go ahead and try it. I&#x27;m pretty sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just awesome for your skin, great service and have my sister using it. Sure keeps your skin looking younger than your age.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon as usual great service.</li>
    <li> Excellent - skin is brighter and lifted.</li>
    <li> I started Niacinamide B3 Cream Serum 5% two weeks ago.  Hadn&#x27;t paid too much attention to tracking results until today.  Really pleased!  According to the magnifying mirror (the mirror of truth, lol) no more enlarged pores, fine lines are diminished.  This serum is actually effective.  I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product and would purchase this again.thank you</li>
    <li> As promised, I have noticed an improvement in my skin. This product leaves me with a moisturized glow, and it&#x27;s oh so good to the face.</li>
    <li> love love this stuff. I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in the look and feel of the skin on my face, There is no need for a moisturizer after using this, makes my skin feel and look good.</li>
    <li> I saw this product endorsed on the Dr. Oz show and really wanted to try it.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it and was  pleasantly surprised how quickly I received it.  I have been using the serum for only a few weeks now and I can already see a difference.  I&#x27;m super impressed with it and will definitely continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this product!  I am certainly seeing a difference in my skin since I started using this serum.  Both my wrinkles and pores are starting to minimize and my face looks so much healthier.  I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from friends asking me what I&#x27;ve been doing differently, and I&#x27;m sharing!  This product is magical. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this!  I recently ordered my 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> I started using thiis product about 8 months ago and the results are great. I first noticed the feel of my face and the fine lines have deminished. I used  Skin Daily each morning before I put on my daily moisturizer and I notice now I don&#x27;t need as much moisturizer due to me using Skin Daily Niacinamide Vitamin B3 Cream. I tried another B3 Serum and I am not satisfied with the results so I am going back to this product.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, does not make me feel oily…skin looks and feels great.  Pores are tighter leaving skin color is more even.</li>
    <li> My skin is looking younger &amp; the sun spots are fading after 6 weeks of use. My husband asked me what I was doing to make my skin look so nice. I like that this product is natural. The serum makes my skin feel soft, but not oily.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 4 weeks now.  I could tell a difference the within the first few days.  I use a pea-sized amount and apply to skin, wait about 5 minutes, then apply your favorite moisturizer.  I am 48 and have always used expensive department store products since the age of 16.  I stopped using those products that worked for years and just use this with a really good moisturizer.  I had a few break outs the first week but after using it consistently, that is no longer an issue.  I feel that my face looks about 10 years younger and my makeup/foundation looks amazing now. I can see that my skin is tighter and smaller pores.  I am extremely picky about what I used on my skin and the cost is even more impressive.  If you are oily, make sure that you use an oil free moisturizer with this products.  I am starting to go through the change of life, so I use a really concentrated moisturizer at night and a lighter one during the day.  I can also say that I have tried lots of different products over the years and always went back to my department store brand.  I will tell you that this is the first product that has ever impressed me this much.  Give this product a month to work. I hardly every wear foundation during the day and I don&#x27;t feel I need it now.</li>
    <li> I have sun damaged, dry older skin.  I have tried numerous products, some very expensive, but I have never been as impressed with a product as I am with this Niainamide serum.  It leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; hydrated and more youthful.  At 62 this is something!!!  Kathy Morgan</li>
    <li> I like this .&lt;br /&gt;it goes on a little sticky but after it dries I put a dot of my usual lotion on top and it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my skin has improved since using it. the color, wrinkles and tone seem to have improved.</li>
    <li> Definitely feel tightening sensation after applying and believe it has minimized wrinkles around mouth and eyes.  Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I am the &amp;#34;CreamQueen &amp;#34;&#x27; which means I have tried every cream out there, from very expensive to extremely inexpensive &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; over the past 40 years:.  I&#x27;ve go to say, your serum is the bomb!!!  I love it and wish I could have found it sooner.  I am 62 and people tell me all the time that I look like I am in my forties.  I don&#x27;t have any real wrinkles aside from the nasal labial folds and have taken great care of my skin by using sunblock and sunglasses. Your SkinDaily has been a real treasure.  I love it so much, I re-ordered and will do so from now on.  It goes on smooth and your face feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I use it as an under make-up moisturizer.  It is very similar to a ceramide ampule which my skins also  loves. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> So far u used half of the bottle and I really like the fact that its very concentrated and doesn&#x27;t feel stick or oily on the skin. I noticed that my skin became smoother all other and it doesn&#x27;t plug my pores. I wish the texture of this serum would be not so runny cause it soaks thru the fingers and very hard to evenly distribute over the skin. I&#x27;m ok with funny smell cause I hate artificial additives that they add to products to smell better. Overall I like this serum and plan to continue using it for long term effect:) thank you!</li>
    <li> I think I like the effects of my vitamin C serum just as well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see quite the results I was expecting. But I still use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this product because it didn&#x27;t do much for me. I am 33 have very dry skin and I&#x27;m starting to see small laugh lines. I&#x27;ve used the product daily for 1 month and nothing looks or feels different. I will keep using it bc I still have a lot left in the bottle and maybe it takes more time to take affect.</li>
    <li> This is amazing , is a good product. , you won&#x27;t be disappointed , I&#x27;m glad I purchases , I will get it again , my skin is really nice , tight and firm is not bolony is the truth ..!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about a month and already see a difference in the lines around my mouth and eyes. The texture of my skin is also softer, smoother and my pores have diminished. The serum feels so rich, absorbs into your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I apply it in the evening and haven&#x27;t had to use my moisturizer. I am so pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I have noticed a big difference in the size of my pores,They are less noticeable and would recommend this to anyone.If you use this after a good skin cleaner like skin cueticals simply clean you will see good results after several weeks of use.It won&#x27;t show over night so be patient and you will see results.</li>
    <li> When I received this, it was leaking out of the bottle and had lost about 1/4 of the product.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles. This stuff isn&#x27;t all that. I&#x27;m $40 poorer now. Wishing I would&#x27;ve bought just one bottle, or actually NONE AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;TO LATE FOR REFUND NOW.&lt;br /&gt;Good old coco butter lotion works better than this crap.  Sorry, but that&#x27;s how I feel.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Seems to seal in moisture.  I can tell a difference when I wake up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out different skincare regimens to see what works best for my very dry skin (I&#x27;m prone to eczema, even on my face, and working toward full-blown rosacea). I had high hopes for this based on scientific literature, but it just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. My skin isn&#x27;t any noticeably softer, smoother, or less red after using it. Additionally, the smell is a little off-putting for me--I have a very sensitive nose--and the tecture is oddly sticky. So far, my best luck continues to be with Aveeno with dimethicone.</li>
    <li> Hubby said I look amazing! He said my lines are looking better! So happy he noticed! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Took a long time to see any results. But skin is improving.</li>
    <li> I spend a fortune on high end beauty products and have for years.  Read the reviews on this product and was curious.  It is now my favorite product.  My skin feels incredible and love the results.  Can not believe the price.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I do love your product!  I actually notice that my pores appear smaller and my skin&lt;br /&gt;smoother. I have tried many products and must say that I am most pleased with the&lt;br /&gt;results I get from your serum.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very good.  Seals the skin, as advertised and gives a moist look.</li>
    <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin since using this product. I have noticed an improvement in my skin tone and texture.  I feel more comfortable without make-up because my skin looks better.</li>
    <li> I noticed that my face is brighter after using for a couple of weeks, I am hoping it continues to do more.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product it worked good for both my husband and I.  It only took a few weeks and our skin looks and feels wonderful</li>
    <li> Thisvis a wonderful product. I use it first thingvin the morning, before other creams and or potions.</li>
    <li> The product has significantly improved my shaving experience. I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> my skin looks firm and plumb...I ordered another bottle. It is now part of my skin care regime</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my 64 year old skin look at least 10 year younger.  My skin actually glows after using this.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well on fine lines and wrinklles, but got a few acne breakouts, Not sure if related.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, so haven&#x27;t seen results yet. I can say that it glides on easily, and my skin feels great after I&#x27;ve put it on. I use a very good skincare line already, so it takes a lot to impress me.  Just have to keep using this consistently to see if it&#x27;s worth all of the other great reviews.  I hope so!!!</li>
    <li> IT REALLY WORKS GREAT</li>
    <li> I am not to fond of this Serum. I absolutely love the water and the  Rose Oil but the serum turned up quite sticky. Maybe I used a little to much (which was a pea drop)... However, I will not let it go to waste. Use in extreme moderation is what I read in the reviews, and they are correct.</li>
    <li> This is awesome serum, I saw results after even the first application, I have used it for about 5 days now and my skin looks radiant.  I do not believe in products where the company give a consumer products for their honest review, that is a joke, as most of the reviews are going to be biased based on getting a free product for a more favorable review. Henceforth, I have not been bribed for this review.  I am also using this in conjunction with my new Clarisonic. My skin looks fabulous and I will be ordering this product again. Thank you Skin daily for a product I can count on.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it every day. My face has never been as clear as it is! I&#x27;ve sent numerous individuals to purchase this. They see a diffrence and want to know what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
    <li> Great Product &amp; loving the results !! Getting a lot of compliments on my skin, Little Goes Long Way !! Great Customer Service, Received email afterwards to introduce product &amp; how to&#x27;s.  Using along w/ collagen pills</li>
    <li> You feel this product working on your skin, great</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I have LARGE pores around my cheeks and fine lines around my eyes. This was my first time purchasing a serum and I am beyond satisfied with the results. I started to notice a significant difference in my skin&#x27;s apperance about 1 week of use. I have been told that NOTHING will cure LARGE pores, however if you find a skin regimen that is best suited for your skin type, I believe LARGE pores can be reduced in size over time. I was able to achieve this goal by using this product and even the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable. #GREATPRODUCT</li>
    <li> Definitely see a difference in the size of my pores.  My skin feels very soft.  Looking forward to seeing how it helps my skin in the future.  Have been using it for about a week.</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin product!  I have a dry-normal skin combination and I find this skin cream balances well with my skin type.  After application, my skin stays soft all day.  I do use it every morning and every night.</li>
    <li> My skin is definitely plumper and more youthful looking, I love this product!  I will definitely purchase more when I&#x27;m out.  What a great product.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product. I use it faithfully in the evening. I also would like to mention that I have been receiving compliments on my skin since using this product so it really works. Would definitely recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a great product after a few months using it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I have really noticed a change in the texture and softness of my skin!  REALLY.  I use their rose water toner first then apply just a small amount of this serum on my entire face and neck.  I don&#x27;t even use a moisturizer anymore as I don&#x27;t feel I need one.  I am 57 and to have a product give me a noticeable change in such a short time is truly a miracle!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was already using another good skin serum , but when I saw that B3 Nicacinamide was a vitamin derivative, decided I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The results are excellent. This skin serum does everything it claims to do and more. After a couple of days of using it twice a day, a nagging dry patch on my eyebrow--which I&#x27;ve had for years, dissolved and did not return. As long as I use the B3 serum at least every other day, the dry patch does not return. I now use the B3 daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plumping of my cheek skin is noticeable too. Especially on the left side of my face where the skin seems a little looser or wrinkled--maybe from sleeping mostly on my left side. I don&#x27;t know. But B3 Niacinamide, with twice a day use, plumps this skin up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to my daughter and highly recemmend the B3 Niacinamide  cream serum here. I am pleasantly surprised and happy at how consistently it performs. And it is a natural product. I noticed that the 1oz bottle contains 5% Niacinamide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other serum I have used for  about a year has good ingredients. However,  the main firming ingredients are listed in the order of six, nine, and eleven on the list. As I understand it, ingredients are listed in order of the amount contained in the product. Most start with pure water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B3 cream serum starts with nourishing ingredients, not water, and the necessary supportive ingredients are added last. So the ingredients that do the actual restorative work are upper most and quantifiably present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you are using now to revitalize and plump your face, diminish wrinkles and such, it is worth your trying this product even if just for comparison. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Follow the directions to get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My makeup goes on smoother, and I really feel better about how I look because of this. I continue to use this Niacinamide B3 Cream Serum and am totally thrilled with how it makes my skin look and feel.es my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My skin has been much less dry in the harsh winter, and my skin tone much more even. I also like the texture, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue that rolls off when I put makeup on like many other products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B3 is one of the few ingredients that has a good amount of real evidence behind its efficacy on skin preservation and rejuvenation, and this product has a good concentration of it. I use B3 at night and vitamin C in the morning and I&#x27;ve had much better results than with much more expensive name brands.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Its been making my skin feel soft and awesome as well as I think my pores are smaller. I love that I use one pump of the serum and that&#x27;s all it takes. Goes on clean and no weird residue or feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Skin Daily Niacinamide Serum and Rose Hip Oil in an offset fashion, the Niacinamide in the AM over my light weight sunscreen lotion, and the Rose Hip Oil in the PM. I&#x27;m finding with the use of both the serum and the oil, I don&#x27;t have to use a heavier moisturizing lotion or cream over these treatments. Before the Niacamide Serum arrived, I had been wrestling with a terrible reaction to a retinol serum.  Usually, I have no problems with skin sensitivity, but this time the skin over much of my face was burned, peeling and flaking.  I was distraught!  Thankfully, in the middle of this episode, the Niacinamide Serum arrived and in just two applications it calmed my skin down and reduced the peeling to a minimum, which was soon gone completely. The Niacinamide works beautifully over my sunscreen, leaving no oily residue at all, and producing a lovely canvas for makeup application.  Both the Serum and the Oil are easily absorbed and make my 68 year old skin feel baby soft and, dare I say it, plump and juicy!  Also, I&#x27;m loving their heavenly Rose Toner.  Although, I&#x27;ve only been using these products for approximately two weeks, I&#x27;ve never seen or felt such a lovely difference in my skin so quickly.  I&#x27;m fast becoming a huge fan and recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product as I have definitely noticed a difference in 2 weeks and so have many friends and contacts. I have just purchased again so I will not run out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for a couple of weeks now and while I think maybe my forehead fine lines might be a little softer looking I don&#x27;t see a ton of improvement.  I have very dry skin and in the winter months it&#x27;s at its worst so I may take a break and try again in the spring/summer when my skin is less distressed.</li>
    <li> use it with other serums and is helping my skin look its best</li>
    <li> My skin drinks this stuff up. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has fewer breakouts and glows after I put it on. I typically use it once in the morning and then again at night. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this has done a good job of moisturizing in the mornings. Only during the driest winter months did I need more.  My pores are tight and wrinkles less noticeable.  Nothing works miracles, but this is a solid addition to daily regimen!</li>
    <li> Did not help with rosacea ...I cannot be a verdict for regular skin care bcos the purpose of me buying this was for treating rosacea</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I will definitely continue to order it. I have noticed a difference and enjoy how my skin looks and feels. The texture, plumpness, and even the discoloration from the sun all show improvements. I am watching the amount left in my bottle closely. As it gets 3/4 empty, I will be reordering. Thank you for the quality ingredients in it&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I find that this serum is a good base for day or night cream</li>
    <li> pretty good suff Maynard</li>
    <li> Love it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and have noticed my face looking brighter, pores smaller, and it leaves my skin so soft. I don&#x27;t even need any moisturizer. Very happy so far.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered your serum. I do feel  that it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;having a beneficial effect overall. A couple of people have  commented on&lt;br /&gt;how good my skin has been looking. I&#x27;ve begun making sure I put  it on my&lt;br /&gt;neck, too, and I think it&#x27;s beginning to help there as well. Thanks  for making&lt;br /&gt;a fine and well-priced product.  And: you have an amazing, personal customer service team!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a couple of weeks now everyday, twice a day and I am pleased to see my hyperpigmentation is lightening! I will continue to use this serum for the benefits on skin renewal with niacin. I have seen more results on my face with this brand than the other 2 I have tried. The price is affordable and I will probably keep using it.  A satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite niacinamide product.  Not only is it a good moisturizer, but the niacinamide and B3 seem to have really smoothed out my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past two months or so and love the results thus far! I can see my skin tone becominng more even...to the point where I really dont need alot of make up  I also noticed a bit of a rosey pink glow!  Customer serive is great from Skin Daily too!</li>
    <li> I received my first bottle of Niacinamide Vitamin B3 Serum, and watched my skin carefully. I was on vacation, and used it faithfully twice a day for the entire week. All in all, I had the product for 8 days. I noticed my deep wrinkles were beginning to fade, the milia which some people complained about, were beginning to disappear. I was thrilled. As I was packing my bag, the bottle dropped from the counter, and splattered all over the tile bathroom floor. I will have to wait now to re-order. That was very disappointing. One criticism, perhaps the bottles could be a dark plastic, maybe recycled material? Anyone considering this product, go for it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful stuff!! Even though it feels silky going on, it&#x27;s not greasy at all. As a fair-skinned, florid-complexioned person, I don&#x27;t react well to most skin creams. The exception has been the niacinamide serum. I&#x27;m very pleased so far. Twice this past week my customers have complimented me on my good skin. It&#x27;s one thing to feel good about your own skin, it&#x27;s even better to have others notice it, too.</li>
    <li> I am using this Skin Daily Serum and love everything about it.  I am seeing great changes in my skin of my hands and face.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I always change night cream every 3 months. But with this Niacinamide vitamin B3 my skin Loves it. I had very dry skin before when I started using this product my skin feels smoother and my wrinkle is not visible anymore. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I wish i could give a better rating. Is there a moisturizer I could use with it or another helpful product.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing! Light! No perfume! No greasy feeling! Affordable! I love it.</li>
    <li> Still to early to tell.  Skin feels smooth, but nothing noticeable as far as smaller pores, skin tightening or wrinkle reduction.  Will come back and post in another 8 weeks with an update.</li>
    <li> this is the best serum on the market! I am almost 60 and fair skinned, so there are imperfections. fine lines and lip lines are disappearing.  lip lines are major plus!  everything moisturizes, but this serum eliminates problems. thank so much!</li>
    <li> I do see a slight improvement but I think it is too early to tell. Maybe in another month, because I intend to continue with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Niacin type serums before, but have never seen such great results as I have with this product.  My skin looks plump, moist and the texture seems to be smoothing out.  Great product and I look forward to continued improvements.  Will keep this is my beauty regime : ))</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life... in love and have already started seeing results.  Use it daily or sometimes twice a day.  Worth all the hype and really not expensive... a little goes a long way.  I started putting too much on and it felt sticky and my makeup looked gross... my fault.  Only a little... let it sit and apply moisturizer (or not) and makeup looks great.</li>
    <li> This is an unbelievable product.  I use a great product line so this was an extra step.  I can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks.  It is smoother, plumper and glowing.  Give it a try.  You need to follow the directions.  Leave it on for 5 minutes before using your moisturizer and you will be thrilled with the results.</li>
    <li> My skin looks really good after only a few weeks of using the serum. It seems smoother and more even. My large pores don&#x27;t look so large anymore. My friends have all said it looks the best they&#x27;ve seen. I had an age spot on my nose that my dermatologist said I&#x27;d have to live with but it is now completely gone! I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will be reordering for sure.</li>
    <li> LOVE this pure rosewater.I use it on my scalp, in my bath and of course on my skin.Smells heavenly</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two weeks and I have saw a great improvement in my skin already.</li>
    <li> Tightens and firms! Evens skin tone too</li>
    <li> Creamy and hydrating. I love the smooth texture and how it plumps my skin feels after applying. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin seems smoother, less congested, and my pores seem less enlarged. I&#x27;ve been enjoying using the product. I also love that it&#x27;s natural and there&#x27;s nothing in it that bothers my skin.</li>
