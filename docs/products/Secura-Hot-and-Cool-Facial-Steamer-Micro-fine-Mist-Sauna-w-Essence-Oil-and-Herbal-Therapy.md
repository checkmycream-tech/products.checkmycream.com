<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Working great! Love it.</li>
    <li> It is bad steamer and broken soo quick</li>
    <li> This product is so great. It completely hydrates your skin and opens your pores. I like to use this then put on a dead sea mud mask so it is able to penetrate deep into each pore. Also has a cooling must seeing that is very refreshing and is good for shrinking pores</li>
    <li> I love this product so much because It has help me so much with my sinuses,</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this steamer! It heats up quickly and within seconds my face is sweating! I love the fact that you can add essential oils to the machine.i just add a few drops to it on a cotton ball and voila! I get the added benefits of essential oils.I have used other steamers in the past and this is by far the best.Great price too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how many facial steamers I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;ve never liked any of them for several reasons.  One is that you have to sit with your face right over the steam.  I would prefer to not get a backache while I&#x27;m doing a facial.  The other reason is that I don&#x27;t like them is because they barely produce any steam, when they do produce steam, the steam is too hot it burns my skin.  This is the best steamer that I&#x27;ve found yet.  I love that it has the attachment steam rod.  This allows me to direct the steam where I want it, so I don&#x27;t strain my back.  I can even lie in bed and let the steam flow over my face.  Now, that&#x27;s relaxation.  And, it produces enough steam to allow you to do that.  The steam is consistent, continuous and gentle, which is not something that other steamers offer.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial steamer I have ever used! I&#x27;m addicted, I use it in the morning with heat and then again at night on the cool setting. I go to bed feeling refreshed and sleep great. My skin has never looked so good! The amount of steam is perfect, it&#x27;s very quiet and I can either sit in a chair comfortably or I can place it on my night stand and lay in bed. The wand is adjustable for any position. If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to own your own steamer this is the one to buy. A must have!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product especially for price. Exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> Thus is amazing! my face is so soft and looks younger!  It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
    <li> I had just purchased another facial steamer that was pretty nice but it killed my neck and back to have to lean over it, so I decided to try this one and OH how HAPPY I am. I can not begin to tell you how nice this one is.The steam that comes out is so fine and soft. I can turn the rod to me instead of me having to bend to it. I believe all women(and men) should have one. I look so forward to doing a facial now and feel so awesome afterwards. Hope this helps all future buyers</li>
    <li> I read the reviews of this steamer carefully, and despite some of the critical reviews I decided to buy it. It is rated well overall, beautifully priced and does have a 1-year warranty, so I figured it would be a good risk. And I was absolutely right.    This steamer is fantastic, and produces very fine, high-quality steam. I&#x27;ve been using it nearly every day since I bought it with no problems. After using the steamer for the past several weeks, I do, however, have some thoughts about why some other folks may have been having trouble.    First of all, this is a great piece of equipment, but it is a somewhat delicate one. I have found the adjustable steam rod sturdy, but I&#x27;d advise that folks Do NOT try and adjust the steam rod unless it is completely cool. adjust it using the cool steam if you want to make sure it&#x27;s positioned correctly, but once you have hot or warm steam going, don&#x27;t touch the rod until it has cooled completely. I am guessing that many of those who have had trouble with the rod breaking have been fiddling with it while it was hot.    Secondly, even if the rod does break, you can still use the machine. The rod exists to direct steam, but without the rod you&#x27;ve just got a regular hunch-your-face-over-it steamer, and this machine is still a good value even if that were the case. I&#x27;m also wondering if anyone has contacted the company regarding the warranty when their steam rod has broken. Perhaps they&#x27;d be willing to replace the rod under the warranty?    For those who have been complaining about water \\&quot;spitting\\&quot;, etc: the manual that comes with the machine states clearly that dirty water will make this happen. It&#x27;s important to use filtered or distilled water and to make sure you clean out the reservoirs and don&#x27;t use water that&#x27;s been sitting in the machine for a week. Also, very important: DO NOT ADD ESSENTIAL OILS OR HERBS TO THE WATER ITSELF. This will also cause \\&quot;spitting\\&quot; and can damage the machine. If you remove the cap from the end of the steam want, you will see a little compartment. This compartment is for a cotton ball sprinkled (or soaked, depending on the strength you like) with essential oils, and is the only way you are supposed to incorporate essential oils into steaming. You can even put an herbal teabag or a cloth sachet of fresh herbs into the compartment!    The one thing I find a bit annoying about this machine is that the max-fill line for the hot water cup is a bit hard to see--you have to duck your head down and look at it that way to be sure you don&#x27;t overfill. The cold water reservoir is much more obvious. However, this is a very minor inconvenience.    If your machine doesn&#x27;t arrive with a manual (it should, mine did, but others have said they didn&#x27;t receive one), go to the Secura website. You will find this product listed there (at twice the price to buy the same unit on Amazon, mind you) and you can download the instruction manual for free right from the product page.    Happy steaming!</li>
    <li> This product just arrived today and I was thrilled by its feature and design. I am enjoying the steam and cool mist sequence of treatment, and also the fact that one can insert oils for enhanced treatments. Very good product with a good design.</li>
    <li> This is a great steamer that my wife uses several times per week. Very convenient in space and easy in operation.</li>
    <li> A great product that works as advertised!</li>
    <li> Use the steamer all the time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use any skin care during my pregnancy for almost 1 year.  And my skin was becoming very dry and horrible rough. My friend recommended this facial steamer to me, and I tried it. I use Estee Lauder Idealist Dual Action Refinishing treatment on damp face, and massage with the warm steam, and rinsed it after 10 minutes. My skin feels very good and fresh.  And then I put the serum on my face and neck, massaged gently with the warm steam for 15 minutes. My skin is totally moisturized and feels so smooth.  I would recommend this product. I think 2 times a week is very necessary.</li>
    <li> This little guy is durable and performs wonderfully! Way better than the cheap made in china models that go for $65 and less!!!!</li>
    <li> This one is a really good steamer for you to enjoy. I like the design with hot and cool mist together. It&#x27;s convenient and elegent. The maximum time is about 25 minutes. A little short for me.</li>
    <li> I just Brough the item but just turn on and it broken</li>
    <li> I was able to use it only once with the hot steam before it would not produce hot steam anymore. I tried reading the manual but it was not helpful. I returned this unit.</li>
    <li> Love this steamer! I have never owned a steamer before and I like the choice of hot or cold steam. I have also used it as a mist for essential oils.   Secura has excellent customer service--I had a question and emailed them and got a response almost immediately ON THE WEEKEND.   I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very excited to try the this steamer but I&#x27;m very disappointed as I have pay a lot for shipping cost (Singapore).&lt;br /&gt;The hot steam is very hot and the amount of water only last the hot steam about 3 mins. The hot steam come out volume is very big and very fast and not suitable for lying down position. While the cold steam, the steam come out very slow. If wish I could return or exchange without paying the shipping cost again. :-(</li>
    <li> I really hemmed and hawed about which face steamer to buy. The ones that you stick your face into, shaped like a big cup, just didn&#x27;t seem to be right (complaints about faces not fitting into the space, etc.) The Secura is pretty awesome and I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Heats up very fast and steam is ready in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to work. Two buttons and a plug.&lt;br /&gt;Storage is easy with the handle and removable spout.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin positively GLOW. Rids impurities and also just FEELS great!&lt;br /&gt;Well-made and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I wish the hot water chamber held about twice as much water (though that would slow down the heat-up process). I run out during a typical \\&quot;session\\&quot; and have to refill. Not that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;I also wish there were more ways to \\&quot;point\\&quot; the steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I definitely recommend this product. As to the one review where someone reported having hot water drip on her face...I wouldn&#x27;t lie under the machine and risk that. I just put it on a shelf and stand right in front of it (without the spout attachment, which is removable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to trying the Secura with essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is a great little steamer. The cool mist feature is nice. I have a $100.00 essential oil diffuser that does the same thing but this directs the mist right onto the face. My menopausal clients love that. I&#x27;m a massage therapist and an esthetician. I just needed a little portable unit that was good for a couple treatments and then could be put away. It works great,, came in great condition too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, Secura Hot &amp; Cool Facial Steamer Micro-fine Mist Sauna and was very happy with the shipping and the product.  I would buy from this sellar again most definitely.</li>
    <li> Works great I use the cold and warm steam together.  Really cleans my skin well.  No issues with the operation!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to join the other negative reviews and I had similar negative experience. The unit arrived well packaged, neat, and clean. I have very dry skin living in the Southwest for over 20 years and was so excited about this steamer. After finding no relief from rubbing creams on the skin I was very hopeful that this was a device to come to the dry skin rescue. The first few treatments of the hot steam were wonderful and felt terrific. It&#x27;s as if one can feel the moisture infusing the skin.  This isn&#x27;t rocket science folks and it&#x27;s very clear to see and know to keep the water levels for the hot and cold compartments full. When in use, as the water level recedes a sensor sounds an alarm to let the user know to turn off and refill. However, the hot steam option stopped working after 4 uses. I removed the hot water cup and found that the interior of the cup had a quarter size melted area. So disappointed! Packed it up and it went back today. If this unit could work properly I would always make sure I had one for the rest of my days. Hopes dashed.</li>
    <li> One of my best purchases. The steamer is small, but it produces a lot of steam . I use the hot and cold at the same time. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love getting facials at the salon, and the streamers they use feels so amazing, so reading the reviews on this item, I decided to buy it. I ABSOLUTELY love it!!!! I think this machine works even better then the salon!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a portable steamer for some time and this one is great!  It is also unique in that it  has a cold steam feature which is great for those with skin disorders such as rosacea.  As a cosmetologist I can attest to the fact that the steam output from this unit is almost as good as the standard fixed units you see in salons and spas.  Thanks again for a great product!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product 2-3 times a week. It has a nice misty steam. The only minor disappointment is the area covered. Have to rotate my head to get full coverage whether I use the attachment or not. NBD really. I like this product.</li>
    <li> I love this steamer and it is very easy to use. I don&#x27;t just use it for beauty purposes but also when I am congested as well. Instead of taking medicine, I use this and Vicks vapor rub. you can also have your own facial at home without going to the spa.</li>
    <li> Am surprised by how light this little guy is. But love the dual function of hot and cold steam. This is the first steamer I&#x27;ve ever bought. Am impressed with how strong the steam is coming out to. The only tiny complaint I have is the cap on the rod comes off very easily but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now. I also let my mom use it multiple times/day mainly for her knees. She has a cold knee and apparently the steamer can be a therapy to treat that. The steamer is still working great!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with essence oil for one and it drips when you have the. Steamer on also if the steamer is on a lol too long whole ding a facial the cool mist won&#x27;t come on this machine sucks</li>
    <li> The product broke within 40 days of gentle use. Amazon wouldn&#x27;t take it back. Now what do I do.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about this product but it actually turned out to be great and also refreshing for my face!</li>
    <li> So incredibly disappointed for the PRICE I paid and the recommendations this ... Steam arm broke within 3 uses of this machine.  So incredibly disappointed for the PRICE I paid and the recommendations this product came with.  I assumed this was a spa quality machine, but boy was I wrong.  The arm and entire steam dispenser snapped off while I was laying under it using it for only the third time after buying it.  So upset about this product.  There is no way to buy replacement parts for it so I just wasted all this money for nothing. TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK, BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Yes this steamer is def not as good as a professional steamer but much better than most at home steamers..  The handle broke about 2 weeks after i purchased it but i contacted amazon and they sent me a new one about 2 weeks later. Its an ok steamer...</li>
    <li> Having some problem and contact with the custom services and got very good response. You can feel your face get moisterized the other day after you use the steamer.</li>
    <li> Great idea and when it works it is a good product.  I have had to contact the manufacturer for the steam wand to be replaced because it literally crumbled into many pieces after about 3 uses.  Now the hot steam feature has quit working and only emits a loud noise. I have again contacted the manufacturer for a replacement unit.  This steamer only has hotten light use so it would appear that the product is fraught with problems. That being said, the unit is a great size and when fully and appropriately functioning produces a good steam output.</li>
    <li> Got this steamer a few weeks ago and tried to use it once a week, and it works fine. The way I use is: clean face, hot steam, then use clay mask on hot wet face. After rinse off the mask, I can see a lot of white heads on my face and I use a pimple needle to clean them up. It works quite well so far, and I like to put the steamer aside my bed, turn on the music and read magazine, so that I can have a little spa moment at home ;-)   However, this thing can be better if it has a bigger steam outlet, may be something like a mask that covers the entire face? The outlet is a little small, in order to steam every part of my face, I now have to move my head every few minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of facials, just not the costs; so, I bought this product to steam my face before putting on clay masks, exfoliating, etc. Using it on a regular basis has done my skin wonders: my face is softer, smoother, and my pores have diminished. I use the hot steamer every night subsequent to showering--at times it&#x27;s the most relaxing 2-3 minutes of my day. The cool mister is just that, cool. I use it after a hot workout (post washing my face) to reduce redness and calm my skin. I would highly suggest this product to anyone wanting a personal steamer--it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The only problem I could think of is that the side of the water container is a bit small. Otherwise totally happy with it.</li>
    <li> Worked like a miracle. I use it at least once a week to keep my pores open. It is very portable to use around the house. Price was very reasonable. A must have.</li>
    <li> Works OK but it is very Hard to clean, Especially if it is Hard water. So I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I got this product about a week ago, and so far so good. I use it morning and night. The only complaint about it is that I wish it held more water. There are two compartments, one for the cold mist and one for the hot mist. The compartment for the hot mist is a bit bigger than the cold, but still not big enough. It only holds enough water to be on for about 15 mins. When there isn&#x27;t enough water it beeps non stop-which is a bit irritating. Other than that, Its useful and I&#x27;m glad I own one.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I purchased this facial steamer.  I have been able to use it every night before going to bed.  I&#x27;ve been enjoying clearer skin and fewer breakouts.  I simply wash my face, steam for a few minutes, and clean away any more impurities that the steam has drawn out of my skin.  Not only do I go to bed feeling refreshed, but my skin is bright and moisturized as well.  In the winter, I use the cool mist to keep my sinuses moisturized and have been enjoying fewer sinus infections as well.  There&#x27;s nothing better than being able to do your own steam facial at home each night.  The benefits are much more than just going to the spa on occasion.</li>
    <li> Really nice device although the hot steamer uses water really quick and you have to keep refilling but other than that great device.</li>
    <li> Purchased this steamer for my wife in March and it quit providing hot steam in May.  I have sent two messages to the manufacturer seeking a resolution to my issue and they have ignored both requests so far.  If you want a reliable steamer,  look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I feel that the construction is just fine. You do not want to handle this device too rough, otherwise you can break the rod that attaches into the base. It&#x27;s perfect for two people to complete facials. The device will beep at you when it runs low on water. I found the steam to be hot, which it should be. Use basic common sense like keeping your face at the perfect distance from the opening of the rod. The cool mist is a very nice feature and closes up pores. I think it is slightly overpriced, but this company has really created nice product for those looking to get away from the \\&quot;bowl\\&quot; type facial devices. I haven&#x27;t used the essential oil, nor would I recommend using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Secura for about a month now and I&#x27;m very satisfied that I get results comparable to that in high-end day spas. The steam output is ample and the machine heats up very quickly. I purchased the  20% salicylic acid gel which helps complete the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> This is the best at-home facial steamer I have ever used.  An added plus is that it really helps with my dry sinus condition.  I have been using it daily since I received it last week and have not had any problems with it.  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this steamer for about a month now and use it almost every day. I live in the desert and so my skin is always dry and flaky regardless how much moisturizer I use. When I use the steamer, I&#x27;m able to clean my face thoroughly with the hot or warm mist and then seal in the moisture with the cool mist. Steaming my face in the morning has also become a form of meditation for me, as well as a skin regimen.  I always wake up with puffy bags under my eyes and alternating between the warm and cool steam gets rid of the morning puffiness and helps wake me up in the morning.  I have to wake up 20 mins extra, but it is so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the water gets low, the machine does spit out tiny drops of hot water, but putting a towel over your lap absorbs that water and as long as you don&#x27;t have your face right about against the steamer, it shouldn&#x27;t throw hot water on your face. I&#x27;ve only used the steam extender once or twice, because I like the direct flow on my face, but I will use it if I&#x27;m steaming another person. I haven&#x27;t tried using it with essential oils yet, but I&#x27;m also not big on aroma therapy; maybe once I get cold or something.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this item due to some of the bad reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and took the chance because this is the best facial steamer I&#x27;ve used.  The product arrived in brand new condition.  It was very easy to use.  This product is unlike most of the streamers we buy from the stores where you have to position your face close to the shield which strains the neck and most of the time, the steam doesn&#x27;t reach the entire face.  With this steamer, the steam comes out from the rod and is very gentle and reaches your entire face and neck.  I&#x27;ve once purchased a similar model, but the steam was too strong and actually burned the skin.  This product is very gentle.  You can even turn the rod so you can enjoy the steam while laying in bed.  I&#x27;ve been mostly using the hot steam function so far.  The cold steam function produces steam that is very similar to humidifiers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews, but feel compelled to do so with this product.  I have to say that the reviews I read before ordering this item left me feeling uncertain about whether it would even work at all.  Well, I received it when I expected.  I opened the box, reviewed the instructions, filled the chambers with water ... and haven&#x27;t looked back.  The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; steam setting yields a vigorous, steady micro-fine mist that I can really feel.  And the cool mist is a perfect ending to a facial.  I&#x27;ve used the facial steamer almost daily for a week now.  I&#x27;ve not experienced any untoward events to make me leery of continuing to use it.  I think it&#x27;s a great product.  It feels as good as any steamer I&#x27;ve experienced while receiving a professional facial.  The price is good and so far ... worth every penny.  Glad I decided to make this purchase.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this after having had a professional facial. It works great. the water reservoir is small and so it does have limited capacity. It fits nicely on my nightstand or an end table and I will definitely use it in winter as a humidifier, It is refreshing in my dry climate to have this portable steamer for myself and others in the household.</li>
    <li> Used it once for 5 minutes to check it out after I took it out of the box. The next time I used it, the tube that carries the steam literally crumbled! Was so thin it broke apart. I was not able to return, as I had appointments, within a week, it would heat the water but produce no steam and the cold feature just stopped working. Very disappointed. Returning and spending the extra money for a more professional piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> My favorite part of any facial is when they turn the steam on your face.  So I have tried several home steamers and this is far and above the best, with only one issue.  The nozzle cracked turning it (to aim the steam) and it is so thin, I&#x27;m not surprised.  Otherwise, not only can you use your favorite essential oils added to the steam, but the nozzle is just the best as you don&#x27;t have to hold your face over a steamer at an awkward angle.&lt;br /&gt;And, if I want to lay down, I can put it on something next to my face and it&#x27;s pure bliss.  Guys, spend a little more on the nozzle as it need to be a bit sturdier to work and this will be the best of the best.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this steamer.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, using it at least 2x per week, and it works perfectly--both hot and cold steam.  It only takes a couple minutes to heat up, and the best part is you can use tap water. Most facial steamers require distilled water or they acquire hard water buildup.  I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to buy big bottles of distilled water just to steam my face.  It comes with a convenient little cup to fill the two chambers with (hot/cold).  I use retin-A so I cannot tolerate any kind of exfoliation, so I bought this steamer to keep my pores unclogged and deal with the sloughing from the retin-a. I steam for 3-5 minutes with the hot steam, then zap my pores closed with the cold steam for a minute. Best decision I ever made. My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 8 months</li>
    <li> this product emits ultra fine mist which is so theraputic - not a bad streamer at its price point. Its small footprint also allows me to use it right on my bathroom countertop.</li>
    <li> I bought one 6 months back. The button broke in 15 days. Then I bought second one,the button came off within a month. I am very careful &amp; gentle with all the products I use.The customer care told  me that I have to send the product back to them. I didn&#x27;t want to go through all that headache so I left it alone. Please do not buy that product &amp; get cheated.&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to give even one star but I cannot submit my review without star.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Update----  Lafraise sent me a replacement rod again for the steamer. I have figured out a possible issue with it. I am limiting the hot mist to only the couple of minutes till it heats up, and then turning on the cool mist with it to reduce the temp a little bit. Hopefully this works for the purpose I got it for, for nasal congestion relief with aromatherapy.  ------------------------  The first time this steamer lasted two months before the rod fell apart into three pieces.. Lafraise sent me a replacement item, the rod broke in three days!! Don&#x27;t bother with this, big time quality issues, I was using it once a day for colds while it lasted.   Second issue, since this is only &#x27;fulfilled&#x27; by Amazon and not &#x27;sold&#x27; by Amazon, they only gave me partial refund since it was over a month, look for something that is sold by Amazon. I&#x27;ve also tried the &#x27;Paragon&#x27; one, before the replacement for this was sent out, the steam there is ok, but aromatherapy is crap and its manufactured by the same company so I&#x27;m pretty sure that won&#x27;t last long either.  I&#x27;m back to ancient steaming, heating water in a pot on the gas, wasted time and money on this one!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the product even after I read the negative review.  Lesson learned!  I will have to see if the owner respond back.  When I opened the package, it appears it doesn&#x27;t look new product even though I paid the new product price on the product.  It look like someone used and return the product.  The cold mist doesn&#x27;t work either.  I&#x27;m not sure what is wrong.  There is no mist coming out.  It wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.  I really want to return it.  I&#x27;m hoping to get the respond from the owner on instruction on how to return it.</li>
    <li> This little one is so nice . The steam is so good. But I can see there is water inside it and a little bit dirty on the outside, It might be used by someone else before . But, It is a good product. I love it,</li>
    <li> My skin is better than ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading several reviews and I used it first time after reading the manual. I lay down under the handle with the hot steam on and after a couple of minuets of the steam a drop of boiling hot water plopped onto my eye lid and scalded it. It is still red and I have an import event at work tomorrow. Wish I could sue the company for its pathetic safety standards or lack of proper instructions.</li>
    <li> I love my Secura Hot and Cool facial steamer for the fact that it&#x27;s portable, heats up quickly produces abundant micronized particle of steam, which is good for skin penetration, by allowing the skin to absorb smaller molecules of water. It has the function of cooling mist too. The hot steam I use to open up pores, the cool mist I use for clay masks, or other skin treatments. The fact that I can use Hot and Cool steam works great for my clients who have skin sensitivy issues, not too hot or cool, and it gets them fantastic results. It&#x27;s portable, easy to clean, disassembles quickly and takes up little space. Has a carrying handle, and the nozzle extention has a chamber were I can add liquid aroma or scent to cotten or gauze soaked in it and it will diffuse while it steams or cools. Very easy to clean. I have a portable mobile spa and so far it keeps up with the demands of travel, packing and unpacking everytime I see a client. The timer for either hot or cool steam is about 30 mintues and because the water is aerosolized it goes a long way before I have to refill it. The steamer has 2 seperate chambers to fill one for hot and the other for cool steaming or misting. Uses about 400 watts to heat the water, but does boil to steam in about 3 minutes and the cool mist activates instantly. Overall I highly recommend it compared to others that I have used in the past. It is very salon quality for use for being a powerful producer. I have had this product now for about 6 months and use it daily at least 3 times a day and it has held up like the industry salon type steamers... Love It !!!</li>
    <li> The price I paid for this unit, it was just OK but I would not recommend it&#x27;s success.  It does hot steam on one side and cool mist on the other; however, my unit did not work on one side so I have yet to experience all that this steamer said it had to offer.</li>
    <li> I like the steamer works great... But it never came with the Essence Oil..&lt;br /&gt;Over all the steamer works great ..</li>
    <li> I received this product yesterday and used it right away.  I purchased it for helping cleanse my face to treat my acne.  Even though some skin specialists don&#x27;t recommend steaming to treat acne, as it may aggravate it, I&#x27;ve seen improvements with my skin in the past after leaving steam rooms and finishing hot baths....so try this for acne at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assembly and use is dummy-proof...all you have to do is put the wand in and fill the steamer up with water.  Be sure not to fill it up with too much water (there is a MAX line on the side of the steamer).  Also, the water compartment underneath twists off (which also has a MAX fill line), so be careful not to spill all over yourself, like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you turn the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; switch on, it takes a few minutes for the steamer to get started, so be patient.  You&#x27;ll start seeing the steam come out when it&#x27;s ready for use.  The water in the compartment will last about 10 - 15 minutes for steaming (I didn&#x27;t time it exactly, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was under 20 minutes).  Be careful -- it gets REALLY hot beneath where the water compartment is because the heater is in there, so don&#x27;t put it on your lap or any heat-sensitive surface.  The handle is there to make it easy to hold and steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cold feature as well, which felt refreshing on my skin.  One negative thing about the cold feature is that this strange plastic/chemical smell was coming out, but I imagine that will go away in time since the product is fresh out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin results:  I broke out a bit more, which happens when my skin is detoxing.  However, some old blemishes did fade a bit.  Like I said, do at your own risk.  The product does what it&#x27;s supposed to, so I won&#x27;t knock it just because of how my body reacts to it.  I&#x27;ll wait a couple of days for the broken skin to heal before I try again.  Overall, I love it.  If I can&#x27;t use it on my skin anymore, I&#x27;ll put it to other practical uses, such as when I&#x27;m sick with the sniffles or if I need to steam my clothes!</li>
    <li> This unit works great, small and compact, I can take it with me.&lt;br /&gt;Love the cool mist it uses with the heat.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy</li>
    <li> The product works well but it does not come with essence oil like I expected based on the title. It also doesn&#x27;t hold much water so you need to refill it multiple times.</li>
    <li> A must have for super soft skin! I use this nearly 3 times a week and then I apply my serum or use a facial mask and my skin feels so soft the day after! It&#x27;s also good if you know how to use blackhead extractors. This is very durable and I love that I can adjust the angle where the steam shoots out. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> So disappointed,after about 20 uses during the 5 months I have owned this steamer,no more warm steam.In the past I&#x27;ve owned facial steamers,such Conair w/zero problems. I &#x27;m hoping if I contact the company directly they&#x27;ll stand behind their product and repair or replace it. If they do I will gladly give them a 2nd chance.If not, I&#x27;ll order a conair warm steamer only.(maybe the coolwarm feature is too much to expect,bummer.)</li>
    <li> NORMALLY I HAVE HEADACHES AND PHLEM FREQUENTLY BUT THIS IS NOT MIGRANE. WHEN I USE THIS FACIAL STEAM ER MY HEADACHES REDUCED LOT..</li>
    <li> It delivers a fine mist.Very soothing.I find that I&#x27;m using less moisturizing cream and makeup remover for my face . Good bargain.</li>
    <li> I love this steamer. It would have been nicer if the steam lasted a little longer but regardless it is good.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! I use it about 2-3 times a week, switching between the hot &amp; cold setting. The quality is exceptional. It is lightweight, can be conveniently moved to different locations, and my skin has never been more nourished. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone thru all the cheap-o Conair and Revlon etc steamers.  Those put out a very tiny shoot of not even potent steam.  But this baby really blows out the warm steam enough to make a difference to your skin.  It softens skins and opens up pores.  Really.</li>
    <li> very good steamer. I recommend using bottle water to avoid clogging it and get water droplets instead of steam.</li>
    <li> Like at least one other customer, I received a used item.  I could see that the unit had water droplets inside and was clearly already used.  I didn&#x27;t bother to try to use it and decided to just return it.  I paid for a new item and expected to receive a new item.  Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> I order this portable steamer for my business , I ask somebody that wrote a review that used on his portable spa, so I order it because I gave a brand new portable spa, so far do good, I used a lot with the aromatherapy essential oil and my clients love it.good investment</li>
    <li> ITEM MET ALL MY EXPECTATIONS - PRETTY CLOSE TO EXPERIENCE AT SPA.&lt;br /&gt;BEING ABLE TO HAVE HOT, COLD OR WARM STEAM IS A PLUS.  ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT HOT STEAM DOES NOT LAST LONGER, I JUST KEEP A SMALL CONTAINER NEAR THE BED AND REFILL WHEN NECESSARY.</li>
    <li> there is simply no justification for the price point on this item. it should be no more than $14.99. cheap plastic. and there is no special technology ion this item that would justify the price. save yourself money and buy a unit under 20$. you will basicly get the same type of product and quality. this is garbage.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s big... but the water tank is small... the cold one is even smaller... extremely hard to clean it.... !!</li>
    <li> Good for personal use, not intended for professional purposes. Not very many parts but it does not seem like it was built to travel a lot regardless of its size. It can leak/ drip from the steam nozzle. It heats up pretty quickly. I do like the hot/cold steam feature as most only have hot steam.</li>
    <li> great product, would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This is the finest steamer we have ever used. The steam can be pointed to all areas of the body, so if you need it, say, on your hand, voila, you have it. I ordered a second one just in case my original one, which is working great, ever decides to die. I do NOT want to be without one of these. Secura Hot &amp; Cool Facial Steamer is the best bar none, and I have utilized several other steamers. I would only purchase this one from now on.</li>
    <li> It worked great the first two to three times, however everytime after that when I want to use the steamer on the \\&quot;Hot\\&quot; setting I hear a series of beeps and the unit never turns on for the hot steam.  Do not waste your money if you are looking for a facial steamer with hot water.  Other buyers have complained of the same thing....save your money and buy a more expensive unit.</li>
    <li> Bought this product about 1 month ago. Used it 3 x. It worked great.i tried to use it again today, the heat quit working. Fortunately,  it&#x27;s within return period, so I got the return label and can have refund. Since this product produces really good steam, I really loved it when it worked, I I am going to give it a second try. I will try to use it at least 3 to 4 times a wk within return period just Ian case it stops working again. I&#x27;ll keep finger crossed and hope to get one that will last a while ☺</li>
    <li> The first time I used this it was great, I could see and feel the steam and was comfortable with it.  After this, I never saw the steam Come out again.  Although it&#x27;s very portable, it&#x27;s not very convenient for providing facial devices to others.  It&#x27;s hard to find the right angle to have the steam hit client&#x27;s face.  It&#x27;s a beautiful, light weight steamer.  I just wish it was more flexible in adjusting to different heights and angles.  I&#x27;m returning the steamer.</li>
    <li> Bought it a few weeks ago. Best choice for me. Skin has improved. Congestion has improved. It works perfectly each time; I use the cold and hot at the same time and frequently without the extender. after washing my face, I use the cold and then apply my makeup. I make sure I keep my face far away enough so that steam is warm and not hot. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> arrived with the heat pump not working. sent it back to amazon bought a diff brand  instead one that was cheaper too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a lady friend and after less than 10 uses (using distilled and filtered water even), the unit broke within 90 days. Bummer the warranty seems to end after 60 days. The experience was a FAIL for her. :(</li>
    <li> SO EASY TO USE AND FEELS SO GOOD.  I EVEN USE IT IN MY BEDROOM FOR MOISTURE WHEN I SLEEP.  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY DRY CLIMATE.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial steamer I have ever used.  I was not too sure of it because it did not have a face cup to put your face in, but this works better.</li>
    <li> Love this little guy. Is really fast to get hot steam and cool mist is instantaneously. You should run it once or twice before using it for yourself to get to clean it well.(First time has a little funny hot plastic kind of smell) It is very easy to clean, and if you use the cup that comes with it will be 1/2 inch under the maximum water allowed line in both tanks. The difference between this one and a professional one is the fact that the professional ones are silent, this has a low background sound like probably has an inside mini fan.</li>
    <li> After much research, this was my second pick but was available at the best price. It is well worth the price!  It is great for the face and also helps the sinuses!</li>
    <li> Finally! I do not have to go anywhere to have my facial. This steamer is amazing. I turn it on hot and use enzyme mask to open up my pores for cleaning. It provides even consistent steam, just like in a skin clinic or a spa. After I am done I put a gentle exfoliating mask and switch to cold steam, feels great. Works fast, love it.</li>
    <li> definitely blows out tons of steam</li>
    <li> Works well.  There are occasional drops of hot water so I&#x27;d advice against staying right underneath the sprout.  The steam travels so that isn&#x27;t a problem with me.</li>
    <li> The steam comes off very narrow therefore you do not get full exposure rather, you have to keep moving your face across the steam jet so that all of your face gets some steam. As a result, while one quarter of your face gets steamed, the rest of your face cools off and therefore your pores contract. You never get a full 3 to 5 minute steam facial on your entire face. Then, the product broke after short use. Would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t worked for me. The hot steam light switch turns on. However, no steam is visible or coming out. The water is heated but nothing comes out. The cold steam doesn&#x27;t work at all--the light doesn&#x27;t turn on nor does anything come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to contact the seller but I have yet to receive a response.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this facial steamer. It is just as good as a tool that professionals would use to prep your skin for facials. Make sure to clean your skin before using it, so no dirt gets trapped into your pores. My skin appearance has changed a great deal with the help of this steamer! I still need to try the essence feature but first I need to figure out where to buy it from.</li>
    <li> Love the steamer! The only one I could find that has hot and cold steam and aromatherapy! And at such an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife at her request. Upon receipt of the item, she noticed signs of wear on the machine, but tried it out anyway. After filling the machine with water in both hot and cold reservoirs, she was able to turn the hot steam on, and that seemed to work just fine. When attempting to turn on the cool steam, the power indicator light did not even come on, and the machine simply kept producing hot steam. The cool steam function did not work, so the unit was returned.</li>
    <li> I loved it for a few days....then I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  Followed all the rules but it still doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I have adult acne w combination skin. It&#x27;s extremely difficult to maintain the proper balance of hydration for my skin. I noticed a big difference after just the first use. Paired with a derma roller it&#x27;s about the only beauty gadget I need... so far! :-)</li>
    <li> Would not recommend. After a couple of use started spitting out hot water and make loud boiling noise.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like at the spa!  Great product for giving yourself a very spa-like facial and really helps your skin.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and picture is exactly what it looks like. However, I&#x27;m not happy with how long the steam lasts for and the instructions state 25 mins, but no way does it go over 8-10 mins. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re combining the hot and cold steamer together to get the 25 mins.  Regardless, you pour the water into the steamer and decide if you want cold or hot steam. The steamer works good at first, but my HOT steam failed after 4 times of usage.  This steamer is poor in quality and unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had it too long to return it.  There goes $60 bucks out the window.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product so that I could do my own facials at home.  I received the steamer, filled it with water, plugged it in, flipped the switched and nothing.  I saw that the water was starting to heat up but no steam, 20 minutes later still nothing.  I don’t have time for that.  Not really sure what the issue was with this product all I know is that I was VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> Hands down one of the best little steamers out there I reckon. Have it positioned on the side of the couch raised by a box and use this once or twice a week whilst watching tv. Totally improves your skin with regular use of the hot and cold one after the other.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I can use one cool and another hot. It helps to open the pores as it does to close them. It also helps my husband in allergy season when we can&#x27;t stop sneezing. BIG 5 STAR</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought a different steamer and it was horrible. I bought this one for her as a christmas gift and she loves it</li>
    <li> I use it every night, It works very well, after this sauna, I even sleep well. I recommond it to my room mate, she loves it too, will buy one for herself.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this facial steamer, but it was a huge let down, it only worked for me 3 times, I am now in the process of shipping it back for a refund.&amp;#34; Stop releashing releasing hot steam even when I add more water to the hot side, it only operated on the cool steam.</li>
    <li> I can remove my blackhead on the nose with a blackhead pin remover after facing the hot steam for 10 mins. When I have nasal congestion, I put a cotton pad with essence oil in the little chamber near the nozzle.  It works amazingly and I can breathe again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t by this product based on overall high rating. Read the one-star ratings. I tried to return is but I am out of luck as it only has 30-day return policy and I am sitting at 32 days!&lt;br /&gt;The heating element will not work on my unit after a few use - it has been a common problem indicated by the one-star ratings. I wish I had read them. No response from the seller on this problem that tells you something. Very disappointed and out of $65+ dollars. Stay away from it.</li>
    <li> This is a fair portable steamer. I bought this to take with me for mobile facials. I just used it for the first time and have encountered a couple downfalls with the design. You cannot adjust the position of the arm, it only spins left and right so you have to have the perfect height table to set it on so that it reached your client. For example, I used a TV tray first and it was too low so then I put it on top of my towel warmer but that was too high. The steam while steady does not have a lot of power either, which is why it has to be at perfect height. It is also a bit loud and distracting and because it has to be so close to the client it can be annoying. I also wish there was a clock or timer and an Ozone option would have been preferred. This is definitely not ideal for professional use, but great for at home.</li>
    <li> This device broke after one use</li>
    <li> I like that this machine is so light weight, and easy assemble/disassemble so I can move it around and store it easily. I put a green tea bag in the herbal compartment to make a spa like experience.</li>
    <li> Product is great, works and keeps face silky soft</li>
    <li> The heating coil stopped working during the first time I used it. Poor quality.</li>
    <li> got product today, mold growing in water resivour, melted plastic by heat button, very very dirty (black smudges, dirt in the seams, actual fingerprints in black),heating element covered in white stuff, like from salt water, cant believe they would send out a used product but pretty sure thats exactaly what they did! turned it on anyway to see if it was worth reordering and it works great, tons of steam, covers the whole face, not sure what i&#x27;ll do, lets see if the shipper makes it right! would give the product 5 star but im rating what i received.</li>
    <li> This item is not good quility at all. I only used 3 times and the heat was burn. And it cann&#x27;t stay long as I need. It only last 10 minutes. As for facial steam, it is better steam for the face at least 20 minutes and the skin can be warm up and the pore is opened so that it will get deep cleaning. I am a cosmetologist so I don&#x27;t feel this is good to recommend people to buy it.</li>
    <li> Love this little steamer. So nice and refreshing!</li>
    <li> Not bad but I&#x27;m returning it. I couldn&#x27;t use it lying down on the couch, even with the little are thing, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; the steam hard enough, it just shot out a couple of inches.  Plus the noise made me afraid it would drip scalding water on my face, not that it ever did drip, it just kind of sounded like it was going to spit. I had to sit directly in front of it and bent over in order to use it.</li>
    <li> Works great exactly as advertised very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and when the nozzle broke into pieces - i could not contact the seller at all.they have a bogus&lt;br /&gt;telephone service that is a scam for free trips - dont bother</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me because I have been breaking out due to hormonal changes.  It&#x27;s great that I can start with hot/warm steam, apply my acne mask to clean my pores, rinse then use the cold mist to shrink my pores.  I try to use it once or twice a week.  It helps keep my pores clean.  I have recommended it to my teenage son who is starting to show some signs of teen acne break out.  He hasn&#x27;t tried it yet but I&#x27;m sure he will once he realizes he needs to keep his break out under control.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy ... Stopped working right after 3 months.Lights are not coming on seems to be something wrong in the electrical system.Can&#x27;t return the product now , no way to get service done for this .Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this steamer! I use both hot and cool steam and u have the option to do both which throws out warm steam! and for some reason it looks bigger in the picture but its pretty small and portable it fits anywhere!</li>
    <li> The steamer is good, I bought 3 steamer from this seller, but one of this steamer the seller forgot to give me the steam rod.. Whiout the steam rod how can it work....</li>
    <li> The steamer itself is nice in the first several weeks. However the hot steam stops working now and I can only use it as a humidifier.</li>
    <li> cant go a week without giving myself a facial&lt;br /&gt;and this steamer just makes me relax&lt;br /&gt;is super fast&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean and work so great</li>
    <li> This little steamer worked great for about 3 or 4 sessions of steam. After that, it quit working. The water no longer heated . Since I purchased it for the steam feature (hot setting, not cold) it no longer serves a purpose. I am returning it.</li>
    <li> I used this three times, and then the heating element broke. This steamer no longer produces any steam. Very disappointing! I can&#x27;t even get a hold of the seller Lafraise so that I can get a replacement.</li>
    <li> I love this steamer. The water is heated fast and the steamer is very easy to use. There is only one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it only steams for about 10-13 minutes. Then you have to turn it off and add water in again if you want a longer time steaming.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I have used it every night since I got it.  It arrived as promised and does everything it claims.  I use it with a calming chamomile essence oil, making it more soothing and relaxing.  I don&#x27;t have to go to the spa for an expensive facial anymore. Great product for a very fair price. :-)</li>
    <li> Had a problem with delivery which took a few weeks to resolve but it was resolved by the seller. Product is great. Easy to use both with hot and cold steam. Very relaxing. Great product for the price. Compact and easy to store. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this steamer a few months ago and I wanted to post my review after seeing the results from regular use. This steamer is the best! I enjoy it so often I try to steam daily, twice if I&#x27;m able to. The steamer produces a consistent flow and maintains perfect heat. My skin radiates and appears refreshed and supple. Hot/cold steaming is a great natural cleansing alternative to harsh cleaners that target deep pore cleaning.</li>
    <li> I got this steamer when I was told that there were &#x27;lots of little bumps&#x27; under my skin when I last got a facial. I have used it 3-4 times and cannot feel any more bumps. In addition, I find it very soothing to have scented mist (I use tea tree oil) blown onto my face. It&#x27;s like my own little 20-minute spa treatment at a bargain price. I think that it will be good as a humidifier in the winter as well.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that produces ionic vapors.  The ONLY PROBLEM I had was after using it for the first time on hot steam and then cold vapors, the base of the extension wand cracked.  It&#x27;s cheap plastic with does not do well with hot and cold.  If the manufactures would make the base and wand something more durable to hot and cold the device wouldn&#x27;t crack.  I&#x27;m now sad that I won&#x27;t be able to use to wand to spray our lavender oil while using hot steam and cold vapors.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I used it with my masks, excellent results. Definitely recommend it for someone who has dry skin.</li>
    <li> Loved this product when we used it the first time.....second time it quit heating at all and is past the return date....buy at your risk</li>
    <li> Love this thing! I make it a point to use it once a week to clean out my pores since I am bathing in the dirty Los Angeles air.  Or I use it before I go out and put on heavy makeup.  I just put my face over it for about 5 minutes and then get a rough wet cloth and go over skin in small circles. It really helps get you face smooth, clean, and even skin tone. Your makeup goes on great after you do this!  If you can get your husband to put his face over this for a few minutes, he will benefit from it too! I have yet to get mine though..</li>
    <li> The reason why I only gave two stars is it does not stay long. At beginning, it is good to use, although it has a loud noise. About two weeks later, it shut down!!!!!! But because I was hurried to have a trip with my friend, I did not return this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for once in awhile facials but invest in the bigger one!</li>
    <li> There are many reasons that I enjoy this steamer.  One is that it has both hot and cold making it a professional facial steamer which works perfectly.  The second reason is that my kids and I suffer from allergies and sinus problems and the fine mist allows us to moisturize our sinuses and humidify our bedrooms.  Those humidifiers sold at Walmart for less than $30 do not use ultrasonic, they only blow cold wind,  it does not help relieve your sinus problem, only worsen it. The humidifiers that do work are those sold at Bed Bath and Beyond for over $80 and they have cold steam only. This by all means is an investment that worth every penny you paid for.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift. The steam is just the right amount of heat and when its cool its really cool. I got my face close enough to where you could see the mist drops on my facial hairs. You can have both the hot and cool buttons on at the same time or switch between the two. Mine does leak even if I dont over fill to the max but I just put a hand towel underneath. The turning rod  is great if youre sitting or lying down. Its perfect if you have a night stand  right next to the bed. The steam rolls right over your face. Ive been using this for 3 days now and I notice the shine I get on my nose throughout the day no longer appears. My pores are even more tightened.It comes with its own little cup that you can put the water to pour in the machine. I recommend using really cold water or really hot water that way the steam comes out really cold and really hot. If you dont the steam comes out luke warm and takes a while to heat up.</li>
    <li> i use this often, &amp; i purchased it b/c i wanted one that i didnt have to put my face into (icky!) because i have a bad neck &amp; that posture would hurt after 2 minutes, &amp; also because i wanted something i could use my essential oils in as well.&lt;br /&gt;  the only thing about this steamer is that the arm is too short, and the hold at the end of the arm spout is pretty narrow.&lt;br /&gt;  in order to use it laying down, i have to prop it up by almost 12 inches so that the spout-end it is not practically resting on my face.  also, the arm really needs to be longer. perhaps this company (or some company) makes an arm which is longer, or something to extend it.&lt;br /&gt;  i also have to move my face all around in order to have the entirety of my face steamed, and i have a really small head &amp; face. Like, unusually small. Like a little peanut. so, i imagine normal adult ladies using this &amp; probably they experience frustration. at least, i know i do. but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;  Because it is really nice to have a good steamer. it has never given me any issues and i have had it a couple months now, &amp; have used it at least 30 times. i&#x27;m not really sure it makes any difference for my face, but i guess that&#x27;s tyhe kind of thing only time will tell &amp; then you&#x27;ll still never know, really. but i LIKE using this steamer, aside from the issues listed above, it is relaxing, &amp; makes me feel all special &amp; pampered &amp; stuff &amp; that is always a good thing.  :)</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004ML689A Secura Hot &amp; Cool Facial Steamer Micro-fine Mist Sauna w/ Essence Oil and Herbal Therapy]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product several times. I am not happy with it at all. If you need heated steam for your pores:  save your money use a tea kettle.&lt;br /&gt;At least you won&#x27;t need to refill it every 4 minutes (I timed it) so contrary to stating you can lay down and relax? does anyone one consider 3 minutes an agreeable amount of time to relax?&lt;br /&gt; HELLLO!  having to add water every 4 minutes, pay attention to the water level, get up and fill it, is NOT relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;I was never able to get it to put out cool steam, and the heated side does get HOT! so if you decide to try it be careful.&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer stated that it got hot and melted. I could see how that could happen.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s suppose to shut itself off when the water level gets low; I guess?  The instructions are so so, you may not know what to expect in certain situations.&lt;br /&gt; Mine did shut off, but then I would have to wait for it too cool or reset, or what ever it needed in order to turn it back on.  But I want 20 minutes of warm to high heat steam for my facial condition.&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to stop and add water to the unit continually. Also you have to turn the machine to the side to see the where the water level is at!  Shut it down when it&#x27;s boiling, or you will overfill or burn down too low, and then wait to reheat what you add.&lt;br /&gt;Over all the only thing this unit did that was good, was produce a steady stream of HOT steam for up to 3 minutes. For that I gave it 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;That is what I wanted; you would need special height and conditions to lay down to have it steam, or cool mist while relaxing. (if you can get the cool mist to work)&lt;br /&gt;Like a message table or the perfect level shelf?  Oh! or like a salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it had been $20.00 less, or held a quart of water instead of a 1/4 cup,  I may not have been so critical.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I got no cool steam I could have let go too. It&#x27;s not what I need. I can splash cool water on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs visual tanks and fill lines from the front that hold more water, It needs to be able to deliver steam from the front or the side of the tube, or upward for your chin?.&lt;br /&gt;and it needs both choices to work if offered.&lt;br /&gt;CEW</li>
    <li> Use it quite regularly for steaming...great for kids to use as a vaporizer...much safer that the actual vaporizer that I have</li>
    <li> I was delighted with this steamer the first time I tried it, but the steam rod cracked and broke off the next day while I was using it.  This would have been a great steamer if it was better made, but it&#x27;s flimsiness is just inexcusable.</li>
    <li> When I first got it, I love it. I love the function and feels good.&lt;br /&gt;But after two days, it becomes unstable, after running the hot stream,&lt;br /&gt;the cold stream would not work. You have to wait 20 or 30 minutes for machine cooling&lt;br /&gt;down, then it works again.</li>
    <li> I had this for about 2 months now, use it probably twice a week,  very easy to setup and clean. so far don&#x27;t have any problems with this, but just a little opinion share, don&#x27;t use this when you have breakout on your skin. I got some breakout so stop using it for 2 week, just becuz the heat will stimulate your acne,and after the facial skin gets dry so fast , I have to apply moisture immediately.</li>
    <li> Totally worth my money, great product. Exactly what i was expecting for it. I use the first day i got it, works well.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to decide on this steamer, but I&#x27;m very disappointed, because only cool mist comes out. It never worked, need return back to amazon.</li>
    <li> The Secura Hot &amp; Cool Facial Steamer arrived timely. It was just what I needed for my mobile spa business. Love the steam and mist. Very easy to use. LIght weight and portable. Haven&#x27;t used the aroma therapy yet but that was one of the reasons I purchased the steamer. I recommend it highly!!!! The fact that you can use tap water was a plus also. My clients really enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble with nice steam options. This will be an easy add to my house call clients. Great for upcoming cold and flu season as well.</li>
    <li> I have had this steamer for close to a year. It is great. I use the steam cycle for 5 min. then the cold cycle for another 3 min. It is easy to use. All that&#x27;s needed is to keep water inside. It has two buttons, hot and cold and an arm that you can twist. I put it on my dining room table and plug it in. Takes only a couple of minutes to heat up. Good amount of spray coming out. HIghly recommend.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this item again worked twice after that no steam waste of money</li>
    <li> The seller sold a defective product. The cold steamer keeps beeping and nothing happens. Stay away !!!</li>
    <li> I bought this about three weeks ago and did not start using it until a week later. When I started using it then I found out that the cool most doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;And for the hot steamer warming: IT WILL (might) Burn you if ur not careful enough. Let say when u pressed the button an the steam coming out as well as the hot water drops if you planned to lay down and have the steam on top and tryna feel like a fancy salon, DON&#x27;T DO IT!</li>
    <li> I opened it months later to Find out that a piece missing ( piece on top of nozzle ) now im stock with it.</li>
    <li> I read some of the reviews before I purchased. I read one review and someone mentioned that they received the item with dirty smudges and scratches. I never thought I would received something like that, but I did received my steamer in the same condition. The product however does work, but to ship something to a customer that was dirty and scratched is not a way to do business. Especially the customer is paying for something that is new. All I could say is someone from this company should look at their quality control before they package it. As for Amazon I want to continue to buy things from you but just look into this, cause I am not too happy with what I received.</li>
    <li> I had looked at facial steamers for months before I finally decided on this one and I am SO GLAD I did.  I love the amount of steam and the heat... it is perfect!!! I wont be spending $ on facials anymore now that I can do this at home. I find it very relaxing~ I would definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The machine is great but they said i would receive essence oil with it which was not in the box.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and does exactly what it says but I wish the hot steam lasted longer. It only appears to last for 10 minutes or so.</li>
    <li> Well-designed: practical and simple and does the job! A great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Worst product in the Market . After 3 times my wife used this piece of crap, the unit instead of steaming started given hot air and unfortunately sustained burns on her face. I want to return this product and I want a refund. This unit is very dangerous.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful steamer and I used it every day for 6 months then it just stopped working.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 1 year.  I love it!  It wasn&#x27;t very expensive and it has done the trick.  It&#x27;s easy to use and packs neatly into the shelf.  I typically lay on the floor while it steams my face.  I fill the cup with water and click the switch on.  It can&#x27;t get easier than that.  I&#x27;ve not any issues with it since I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a face steamer that&#x27;s easy to use, inexpensive and effective.</li>
    <li> I used this for exfoliating my skin. It is pretty good. I can use either the hot or cold steam. It stops automatically</li>
    <li> Just received it yesterday.  It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected.  It&#x27;s well made, high quality, and cute.  Powerful - makes and blows a lot of mist - hot and cold.  Hot is pretty hot, can burn if really close.  Because it is small and powerful, water runs out quickly, like 20 mins. or so.  It comes with little pouring cup, easy for adding water to the machine.  Also it works well with aroma oil - very easy operation: Soak a cotton pad with the oil and insert it in the little pocket in the tube designed for herbal medicine pouches or cotton pads.  It&#x27;s a powerful little machine, it&#x27;s a bit noisy when running.  The mist output spout is removable and can turn.  It&#x27;s a space saver and it works well.  Glad I chose it.  There was a 10% discount code in the description when I bought it, the code saved me $7 at checkout.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Hot and Cool Facial Steamer from Amazon, I followed the directions and I never got steam from the steamer, it would not produce any steam at all from the hot steam, the cold steam did produce cold steam, however, it kept beeping and then stopped. I did this twice following the instructions on the following day and nothing no steam. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to putting essential oils in the hot steamer and getting a steam. Waste of money, however, Amazon (and I would give them 5 stars if I could) refunded my money and I am grateful. This steamer would be great if it worked.</li>
    <li> Best facial tool ever. My skin loves it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Perfect for what I need it for</li>
    <li> I had my overall doubts when first purchasing this product...since then I can honestly say that I have never been more pleased with an online purchase :) The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; steam feels wonderful, and the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; steam is so refreshing and feels great as an after-effect. I personally LOVE the fact that it can utilize essence oil, as I ALWAYS do, and it makes it a piece of cake to do so...on a cotton ball or cotton gauze pad folded. It smells soothing even, and my skin feels fantastic!!! I even brought it to my mom&#x27;s and gave her a &amp;#34;facial&amp;#34; with this and some other products...GREAT JOB!!! Doesn&#x27;t burn, works great!!!</li>
    <li> I have always loved to steam my face, but I really don&#x27;t like being laid up under a towel for 15 minutes just to be able to get some good steam on my face.  So I stopped steaming.  Then I came across this steamer one day on Amazon and some of the reviews were compelling enough for me to give it a try.  I am SO satisfied with this product and the technology it uses to give you really good steam -- I just sit at the kitchen table in the morning with a cup of coffee or use the handle to hold the steam wand right under my face while I kick the ball to my dog (yes, I did this!).  The concentrated steam that comes out of the wand, when positioned properly in front of your face, gives you this intense, therapeutic steaming experience -- it feels really good to breathe it in, and I swear I can feel my pores opening as I am under its \\&quot;spell\\&quot;!  My routine is to steam first, then use a really good Lush refrigerated mask (Love Lettuce is a top pick) to get all the oil and dirt out.  And if that wasn&#x27;t wonderful enough, you can also drop essential oil on a cotton ball (think Tea Tree for problem skin!) and put it in the top of the wand so that the steam picks up the oil on its way to your very happy face!  Ahhh, this is my new favorite beauty treatment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my product about 2 times a week for almost 3 weeks now. It&#x27;s easy to use. My skin def has a new glow to it. Easy to use. Does it job very well. I only used it for the hot steam and I have the same effects as if I would have gone to my usual place for a facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after my showers and before bed... I&#x27;ve also used it as part of my &amp;#34;getting ready to go out&amp;#34; . And twice I&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;wow, you look great.&amp;#34; reactions as far as my face or my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small enough for table top use. I&#x27;ve also stacked on some books on the floor and lied underneath it. I find better results on the table top method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that for a home use it&#x27;s very effective and durable. Usually at home version of beauty stuff is just really cheap or doesn&#x27;t do it as good as the salon. Not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase &amp; recommend.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet, but I am very excited to try it.  I ordered some essential oils and am waiting for them to arrive so I can get the full experience.  Will update once I have received the oils and tried the product.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to buy an at home facial steamer but I wasn&#x27;t sold on it completely because I wasn&#x27;t sure the quality and how disciplined I would be using it. I have had this for two months now and I love it! It is great quality with a decent price. I sit in front of it with a treatment on for an hour at a time about 2-3 times a week. I look forward to going home and relaxing in front of my steamer. You won&#x27;t regret buying it!</li>
    <li> Incredibly fantastic and does what it should ...mosturizes the face and nose and makes headaches go away in dry winters....extra benefit...just breathe in deeply</li>
    <li> The stream took way to long come out. When come was little bit stream. I wait at least ten minutes before any stream came out.</li>
    <li> Love this! Like having a home spa treatment with out going for a professional facial.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got my shipment and really looking forward to trying it out for the first based on all the great reviews I read on Amazon.  However, much to my disappointment, I opened the packaging carefully and right away noticed little tiny debris/dirt throughout the parts....it wasn&#x27;t obvious, but definitely you can see it with you eyes.  Just not something you&#x27;d expect if you were opening a brand new item.  Then upon closer examination, it appears this product must have been previously used and repacked ..and the parts definitely started to even seem having grey/black molds on them (Which makes sense if it was previously used and not properly tried off before repacking)..Very dissatisfied and disappointed.  Will be returning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  very happy with the purchase, they like it a lot, thanks again, hope you keep growing.</li>
    <li> My unit works fine (guess I am lucky). Compared to those that you have to sit right at the opening, the rod is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> Essence oil cap was missing in package.. so did not get the chance to test this product</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT... I USE IT WITH MY doTERRA ESSENTIAL OILS... IT WORKS GREAT... I LOVE IT... GREAT STEAMER...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this steamer twice so far and I LOVE it!! High quality - just like getting a facial at a salon! I like lots of steam, and this puts out plenty of hot steam. Also love that the rod is adjustable so I can turn it in the direction it needs to go to hit my face or neck. Very satisfied with this purchase! Note: Another seller mentioned the rod is delicate, so be sure to wait for the extending rod to completely cool before twisting it or removing it. Don&#x27;t move it around while it&#x27;s hot.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that I got a follow-up email from the company asking if I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  I wish the rod is more flexible and bandable but overall it an excellent facial steamer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item after having visited a pricey day spa. I used it for about 3 days when it went Kaput! Mist would start then stop then suddenly, stopped altogether. I was sad as I loved it when it was working. I would lie in bed and let the mist cascade over my face and neck. It was very soothing and calming and my skin felt dewy and soft. If the company goes back to the table on this one and does some redesigning, maybe even charge a bit more for the quality upgrade, I would try it again. I have since returned the item and was promptly given a refund.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my acne. I use it as soon as I know I&#x27;m getting a zit. After the next day of use my zit is gone! Works great for facials too</li>
    <li> I read lots of the comments and was hesitatent about purchasing..this is one time I went with my gut feeling.  It is a great steamer that is easy to use..puts out great steam either hot or cold.  Have had for afew weeks and im using several times per week..im so happy with it..</li>
    <li> The steamer works great...it is really handy to use. The only down side is that if you want to use it longer than 3-5 minutes you would need to refill the water tank, and for that you need to turn it off for a few seconds and then turn it back on. So...not much of a deal breaker, just a little bit of extra care. Overwall my daughter and I have loved it to clean our faces at least once a week!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the steamer for about a month now and the hot steam has been hit or miss.  The past week it&#x27;s been nothing but miss.  The heated steam, which is the reason why I purchased the unit, simply no longer works! I just get three high pitched beeps and nothing else. The cool steam works fine; I wish it was the other way around. ACTUALLY I&#x27;d prefer if they both worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful finding a main contact number for this unit or a way to correspond with the manufacturers. It may have come with the instructions that I no longer have? If someone has any way to make contact with the Secura company I&#x27;d be more than grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware.</li>
    <li> Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill. But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely fabulous! Inexpensive but worth every penny! I highly recommend this product.  Easy to use and does the job it claims to do!</li>
    <li> Its very hard to attack the cup with water and sometimes you think its secure-its not!  I picked it up to move from side table to coffee table while sitting on the couch and the cup wit  BOILING water just dropped on me burning my leg from  sides, huge burned area, horrible scars..It has been over a year and they don&#x27;t fed away, I was in so much pain, couldn&#x27;t sit or lay on that side or my back and had to take a week of work!</li>
    <li> I took my chance ordering this unit despite reading some of the reviews about receiving used one.  I received the unit but to my shock, this one is indeed with brown smudge on the outside and water marks in the water container.  The heating element is covered with white hairy mold.  Very disappointed and will return it without even trying it on my face because it is so unsanitized and used.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using the steamer for about a month now.  The warm steam feels refreshing and cleans the pores very well.  I finish it off with the cool steam.  Very nice gift for yourself!</li>
    <li> really like it. I already used for over 6 months. good quality. only one thing, it is a little bit noisy.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive the spa, but I was greatly disappointed. I used it the first day and then went to use it again and the hot steam would not work. Only cool steam. Contacted Merchant via Amazon. Told to break the tube for the steamer, take pics, email the pic and I would receive a refund. Several months of contacting merchant and amazon have left me still without the product and no refund. Terrible!!! Double check the return policy and after that, my advice.. Deal with another merchant.&lt;br /&gt;I hope the company sees this review and next time a customer has a problem with their product, provide the customer service needed by the customer.</li>
    <li> I Love to use it! Awesome!</li>
    <li> does NOT give good hot steam!  Im already looking to have to purchase a new one.  only used 4 times.  also has very loud beep when the steamer is done, CRAZY loud.  not good in a spa!</li>
    <li> I am starting my own esthetic/massage company.  Purchased this to do mobile spa services and clients in my home.  I feel it does a good job in what I need at present.  It is very clean and professional looking.  I enjoy the fact that it is so easy to clean after every use.  The steam is a nice amount.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> It performs quite well; it is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.  I don&#x27;t know anything about the longevity of this gadget - let&#x27;s hope it lasts long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: do not overfill the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; compartment - it will start spilling boiling water into your face.  I got 1-st degree burns on my chin and lip because of my stupidity.  So, just fill it to the max line.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my sister so I don&#x27;t have personal experience with it but she likes it a lot!</li>
    <li> I really like this steamer. The steam does get a little hot but all you have to do is move away an inch and you&#x27;ll be fine. Also it&#x27;s very light and easy to move around or carry.</li>
    <li> I have literally used this every single day since I got it over a month ago.  It&#x27;s perfect to set on the coffee table while you&#x27;re watching tv, or on your bedside table while laying in bed.  It provides a great amount of steam, especially considering it isn&#x27;t that large.  I haven&#x27;t used the cold steam yet, simply because I&#x27;m in love with the warm steam.  It&#x27;s perfect, too, if you have sinuses.  My husband has been using it too for that reason, as well as the relaxation factor. The only negative about my purchase...it didn&#x27;t come with the essence oil as indicated when I purchased it.  That&#x27;s ok though, I still highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was looking for the perfect steamer to maintain healthy hydrated skin in between facials.... This IS IT!  I love the option to use herbal sachets or tea bags to accentuate my skin treatments.  Hands down, would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Usually use the hot steam because I live in a dry climate.  Used the cool steam one time and it has never worked again.  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> The machines doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
    <li> very helpful, especially in the winter when my skin can get very dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent....I enjoy my Secura everyday.  My kiddos enjoy the cool mist as well.  Worth every penny for this product.  Love u+</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive ths item.  Hot/cold steam and aromatherapy.  We set it up immediately and was so disappointed the steam tube was cracked.  We thought ohhhh a lil tape and we&#x27;re good but then the entire tube just seemed to crumble.  I set up a return and got an email from Lafraise and shared my situation.  Not only did they sent out a replacement tube right away but the speedy correspondences made dealing with them a pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;We decided to keep it.  The hot steam is very hot but not scalding and the cool is very soothing.  Has a very nice flow and the aromatherapy is a great addition a lot of other machines don&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;Is it a professional model....no....but amazing product for someone who wants home use without doubling the price.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutley recommend it.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my sister, she loves it! She said her face isn&#x27;t as oily towards the end of the day anymore. I tried as well and it felt amazing!</li>
    <li> Fanatastic product.  Great for facials and aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised. It looks and feel professional. It is very easy to use and maintain. No issue to report after 1 month of use.</li>
    <li> I have only used my steamer once so far and I could not be any happier. I love the wand feature and so does my neck! No bending my head over the mist and that is the reason I purchased this steamer.  After reading reviews of all the other steamers that are available, I chose this one based on the reviews. I am glad I did!</li>
    <li> I love the product. I have been using it 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> Amazing product to go with and highly recommend for 2 reason 1. The product is strong and reliable when compared to made in china products.&lt;br /&gt;2. the Price still matches or even lower . This is second time I am getting this product, the blow of hot and cool air is just perfect for face cleaning and truly worth investment .&lt;br /&gt;Cons : the product has some glass/plastic attachment which overtime gets brittle. Though it is easily replaceable, the spare parts are not available in the market . You have to buy a complete new product if anything goes wrong.</li>
    <li> I got one of this and one rolling type.  This one seems a far better quality than the other I have. The only reason I bought the rolling type is it stay on a stand which easier to control when doing facial for clients. I will give the 5th star if it comes with a stand and longer arm.</li>
    <li> great product works very well</li>
    <li> First, I have to say that many fashion bloggers doubt the value of facial steamer and they said there is no use if you want to use it to do skin care. I use this as a tool to relax my eyes and skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one facial steamer from panasonic, a really big one (not the small one), really high quality, it has about 5 models and set the time to do spa in the cycle of alternate cold and heat. You can feel that it is solid and has high quality, but really expensive: about 285 dollars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came back to US and found this one online, I doubt at first as there are so many one star reviews. But the price is really attractive and I bought this. I have used this about 5 times so far and I could say it is worth the price, even though not as delicate and high-quality as Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some small problems for this product:first, it needs about 2 miniutes for it ready to send out hot steam after first use. (for Panasonic about 30 seconds less). Second: the cold steam is not cold enough compared to Panasonics. Third: The place where you pour water is not a good design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Panasonic, this one it has two switch and you can control the time you want to do heat or cold.&lt;br /&gt;A creative design for this one is that it has a pipe and you can use it when you lay on your bed. But since this is not convenient for me, I have never used it and I usually use it without pipe. And I see a lot of complaints about the crack of the pipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I mostly use it to do hot steam. So this one is a great one regarding its price!  Hope this could last long.</li>
    <li> This steamer is the best!!!  I use it also to add steam to a room</li>
    <li> After much thinking I did in deciding if I should buy this steamer or not I finally did and I dont know why I took so long in buying this its AWESOME! its a perfect Steamer. Arrived so quick too! Its awesome my face feels so soft and clean I just love it! Its well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months.  Used it about a dozen times.  It was clean and unused when delivered.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It could be improved with a longer, more adjustable steam arm.</li>
    <li> I have found this to be everything it claims.  It exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A+++++. Fabulous crate and ship. Exactly as described</li>
    <li> I have been using ths steamer every other day and I love it. Some would argue that it doesn&#x27;t do anything more than a pot on the stove with water in it but my skin looks so much better and healthier. The whole point of it is extreme relaxation. I can literally feel my skin come alive during treatments. Highly recommend for the old and the young.</li>
    <li> This is my first facial steamer and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It does make a diffirence when doing facials at home.</li>
    <li> I know I really loved using it, moved and can&#x27;t find it darn it</li>
    <li> I like it, it is a good product: BUT&lt;br /&gt;the tube broke in the first use because of the heat, and now I just use it  whiteout the tube.&lt;br /&gt;the esteem is really good.</li>
    <li> This is probably the first negative review I&#x27;ve ever written on Amazon. I just got this steamer and I was so excited to try it. The item came brand new, however, only the cool mist works. I tried different levels of water - right at the Max line, below, above etc. When I switch the hot steam on, it just beeps 3 times and doesn&#x27;t do anything. The light indicator doesn&#x27;t go green like the cool mist one does. I was able to magically make it at least go green, so it would start to heat the water (and you can see the waves in the container), but just when it looks hot enough, it would automatically switch off - no hot steam whatsoever. I spent 1 hour trying to make it work. So that&#x27;s enough time wasted. Unfortunately I have to return it...Very disappointed! It&#x27;s probably a hit or miss with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE on Sep. 5, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night after I wrote the review above, I was actually able to get this steamer to work. I just shook it a little and maybe this changed something? It almost sounds like the Russian way - bang on the TV and it starts working. But it did, so I was happy. Otherwise, I was about to return it. I have used it probably 6-7 times already and so far so good. The steam is pretty strong. I keep it for 10 minutes but I think it can go even longer since there is a lot of water left after 10 min.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this steamer, only wished it had a longer steaming rod.  Nonetheless, it is great for doing home calls and mobile spas.  Very portable and takes up minimal space if you are working within a small area like I do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great steamer! I am in love.</li>
    <li> GREAT TO USE AT HOME. i HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET BUT I have seen it used .&lt;br /&gt;looking forward to using this product.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use. I love how you can switch it from a cool mist to a warm mist. I only wish that the cool mist lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Valentines gift and used it for the first time today 2/28/13. First use was wonderful! My skin feels tighter and cleaner already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to set up and clean&lt;br /&gt;Produces a fair amount of steam&lt;br /&gt;Can switch from hot to cold and vice versa fairly quickly&lt;br /&gt;Easy to adjust&lt;br /&gt;Can lay down/relax while using&lt;br /&gt;Can add oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short cord&lt;br /&gt;Have to rotate face in order for steam to reach all areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used the face steamers where you sit and put your face in to it and coming from someone with back problems, that was no ideal. The steam from those type can also get EXTREMELY hot. This steamer is more versatile, you can adjust how far or close you as well as getting a burst of cool steam! That&#x27;s the best part!</li>
    <li> I would give this product 5 stars if the tube was a little longer! It works great though. The hot steam goes evenly on your face and the cold steam starts immediately when you hit the button. I think the cold steam produces ozone too, you can smell the similar fresh air after a storm when you turn the cold steam on. One big disadvantage is you have to work hard to adjust yourself to be comfortable + have your face at the perfect spot to get all the steam. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> i  purchase through Amazon.com.  After a few months it ( no steam comes out  whatsever) doesn&#x27;t work anymore,  i  kept have the box  and  product.  can you replace it with a new one  guaranteed? Efleda,  owner Efleda  A Journey to Healing</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this product and used it the first night I received it in the mail.  However, the second time I went to use it, I was laying on my bed with the product on the table.  About 5 minutes into using it, I heard a loud pop and felt something hit me in the head.  I jumped up to see that the spray rod had cracked in half; half stuck in the product and the other half on my head.  I tried to turn the machine off and burnt my fingers in the process due to the amount of exposed steam since the spray rod fell off. I was extremely disappointed, especially since I had used it all of 1 time.  Not worth it, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing machine, in my opinion it provides enough heat, some say it&#x27;s not hot enough but I personally love it so much!</li>
    <li> The attachment arm piece while using cracked and then broke into many little pieces. I do not think the plastic was meant to sustain the heat. I am very disappointed because it was working out great. I read one review with the same issue and thought it may be a fluke but since it happened to mine I don’t want to replace it, in worry that it may happen again. I had to send back :(</li>
    <li> Really amazing functionality ... I love it</li>
    <li> Its good at what it does, but could have been better if the flow was dispersed. Its concentrated and at a distance, almost negligible.</li>
    <li> Best facial steamer I have used. Three levels of steam: hot, warm, and cool.  After the hot setting boils, press the cool button and both together give you a lovely warm steam at about 110 degrees.  Cool mist is about 72 degrees.  I only use distilled water to avoid breathing impurities and getting impurities in my pores. I bought a second one as a backup.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this all the time for her sinus issues.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve fixed the nozzle so many times that it is now completely encased in duct tape.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic used in the nozzle is either brittle or gets brittle from the steam and doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if it was manufactured to use 1&amp;#34; or 1.5&amp;#34; PVC but noooooo.....&lt;br /&gt;Hey, how about a site where you can buy replacement parts at least?</li>
    <li> Hi, can&#x27;t find the contact to the seller. write a note here, hoping that the seller can see it and help me solve the problem.  I bought This product back to 4 year ago. It works fine. Has been working well but nothing surprising. After all it is just a facial steamer. My problem is the extra pipe part, sorry that i don&#x27;t know what to call it, the tube where the steam comes out is broken. I hope to find a replacement so that I can continue to use it. Thanks for the help.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to decide on this steamer.  I am a prime customer and rushed home to use my new steamer.  When I opened the box, I was disappointed  The unit was scratched and used.  It had black marks, dirty water marks and mold in the water tank.  No instructions included.  Very disappointing.  I packed it up and returned the next day  Not sure I am going to reorder this unit.</li>
    <li> Cool mist button didn&#x27;t work :(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this but my wife did and so far i haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from her so it must be good.</li>
    <li> Yes - good for six steam sessions, then device over-heats and doesn&#x27;t steam...waste of money. I try really hard to give a fair and good recommendation, but this unit deserves a \\&quot;1\\&quot; for short-lived performance.  Amazon made me write 20+ words.  Would have stopped at first sentence.  Now I must decide whether I want to return or not - over 30 days...:(((!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;d left the unit plugged in, with the (seemingly) dead cool mist switch on, and now it seems to be working fine! So I guess the moral of the story is, give it an hour or so before giving up on it? In any case, cool mist and hot mist are currently working and I&#x27;ll be hanging on to this product and trying it out for a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to receive this in the mail. The hot steam at least seemed to work fine. A little too hot for my taste, but lots of steam. The cool steam switch, though, was totally dead. The switch didn&#x27;t light up and nothing came out. When I&#x27;d first opened the package, there was a little leftover water in the tank, which I thought might have been from factory testing of the product. Now I realize it was probably used and returned previously. Now it&#x27;s time to schlep this to UPS to return it.</li>
