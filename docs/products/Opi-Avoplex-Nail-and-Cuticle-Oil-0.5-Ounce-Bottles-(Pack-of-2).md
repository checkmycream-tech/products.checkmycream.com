<li> I tried looking for their cuticle oil in several of the local beauty supply stores but they didn&#x27;t have it available.</li>
<li> Totally  dries your nails fast.</li>
<li> Using it daily and can really notice the difference.</li>
<li> Really helps with dry cuticles.</li>
<li> My nails are thin, brittle and break easily.  </li>
<li> If you apply it every day on each of your cuticles, you will have no more hangnails to trim, and your nails will be much stronger.</li>
<li> It keeps my dry cuticles as hydrated as it is possible for them to be.</li>
<li> In addition, it&#x27;s terrific to apply to automatically dry nail polish.</li>
<li> It definitely helps my dry cuticles...</li>
<li> I have ridiculously dry hands</li>
<li> And it keeps my finger nail out of dry.</li>
<li> AND CUTICLES ARE DRY AGAIN.</li>
<li> It is not too oily and helps my dry hands and cuticles heal.</li>
<li> If my hands are really dry, I use it in the morning, too.</li>
<li> if your the skin around your nails start to look brittle and dry ..</li>
<li> and I actually have to file them down because they get too long!  </li>
<li> I have very dry skin</li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> but I just aliquot it into other containers.  </li>
<li> My nails were ravaged from peeling gel polish off of them (I know, bad move!), and this oil has them in noticeably better shape after just three applications today.</li>
<li> I keep a bottle by my bed and one at my desk and apply a few times a day and once at night.</li>
<li> The bottle design is a little flawed though - hard to keep it closed properly once oil gets around the threads</li>
<li> I have had the MOST terrible cuticles and dry skin around the nails (aided and abetted by the horrible habits of chewing the skin around my nails and constant, mostly daily, nailpolish remover/nailpolish application) and have tried EVERY lotion/product out there under $20-30.</li>
<li> With Avoplex they are hard as nails</li>
<li> Cuticles are always tough for me</li>
<li> That&#x27;s how bad they were.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easy to us with nail brush and quickly absorbs . I use this daily on my cuticles / nails. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Best cuticle oil I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> if your the skin around your nails start to look brittle and dry .. try buffering your nails and then rub this oil onto your nail.  This is better than any lotion and the skin and nails look healthy for days, even though the instructions tell you to apply it twice a day. your nails will look like it just came from the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is saving me so much money in between salon visits.  I am just so glad amazon is stocking this product as I had to find this product in a specialist store before finding it on this site.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  Rich moisture for her nails.  She is so happy to have it.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased! My nails were ravaged from peeling gel polish off of them (I know, bad move!), and this oil has them in noticeably better shape after just three applications today. I can see my nails being better than ever in a week, tops, if I stay on track applying regularly. Bonus points for smelling pretty!</li>
    <li> A must have!! Totally  dries your nails fast.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff smells. I used to purchase this at Ulta, but my local store has quit carrying it...this is a better deal, actually, so it worked out for me. I keep a bottle by my bed and one at my desk and apply a few times a day and once at night. It definitely helps my dry cuticles...I can&#x27;t say it makes my nails grow faster, but it might? It is similar to the oil they brush on your cuticles and nails when you get a manicure in a salon, only it smells lots better. It&#x27;s also great for dry elbows and knees, or sometimes I just pour a bit in my palm and use it in lieu of hand lotion when I don&#x27;t have anything else. Moisturizing, for sure.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced results yet, but I have not been using it regularly.</li>
    <li> One of my petite luxuries; and it lasts a long time, if used wisely.  I use it after I shower and it&#x27;s good from then to the next</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a difference in my nails and cuticles. They seem the same as when I use Nivea hand lotion.</li>
    <li> I have had the MOST terrible cuticles and dry skin around the nails (aided and abetted by the horrible habits of chewing the skin around my nails and constant, mostly daily, nailpolish remover/nailpolish application) and have tried EVERY lotion/product out there under $20-30. Nothing worked. Some stuff was better than others (a couple LUSH products, argan oil... vaseline...) but nothing was awesome. This is perfect. Only three days in and I apply while typing/working in my office or at home, and my cuticles are lovely (like right after a manicure) and I even use it on my perpetually-chapped lips (as of today) and have started noticing a difference in HOURS. On top of that, it smells like heaven. Could NOT be happier.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  If you apply it every day on each of your cuticles, you will have no more hangnails to trim, and your nails will be much stronger.</li>
    <li> I have ridiculously dry hands and my cuticles are always cracking.  I have tried soo many products, but this oil is amazing!  It moisturizes so well, it absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue once it absorbs.  The bottle design is a little flawed though - hard to keep it closed properly once oil gets around the threads but I just aliquot it into other containers.  A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love all of the OPI nail products. I tried looking for their cuticle oil in several of the local beauty supply stores but they didn&#x27;t have it available. I use this product at night just before going to sleep, this allows the oil to penetrate the nail and cuticle while I&#x27;m sleeping. The results are fantastic, your cuticles and nails will have a healthy appearance in no time at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever.  My nails are thin, brittle and break easily.  With Avoplex they are hard as nails and I actually have to file them down because they get too long!  I love it.</li>
    <li> Using it daily and can really notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery,my cuticles look the best they have in years.Would recommend this product to everyone who home manicures their nails.</li>
    <li> Great product as are most OPI products are.  Really helps with dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> IFS MY FIRST TRY WITH CUTICLE OIL, SO, I AM NOT N EXPERT. IT WORKS GREAT USED DAILY, SKIP A DAY AND CUTICLES ARE DRY AGAIN. MAYBE THAT&#x27;S GOOD BECAUSE IT MAKES ME USE IT DAILY</li>
    <li> My hands are constantly in water, or exposed to photographic chemistry.  A few drops of this oil on my nails at night really softens the cuticles. If my hands are really dry, I use it in the morning, too.</li>
    <li> This nail and cuticle oil is great!  When used as directed, you see a total transformation.  I will definitely use from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I haven&#x27;t been able to grow out my nails until I started using this.  It took about four months of daily use before my nails stopped breaking.  That&#x27;s how bad they were.  I am allergic to nail polish, so I can&#x27;t harden or protect that way.  This is the first time in 30 years that my nails have looked nice.  I use the oil at east once per day</li>
    <li> I love this product. It keeps my dry cuticles as hydrated as it is possible for them to be. In addition, it&#x27;s terrific to apply to automatically dry nail polish.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this worked fine for my hands.  I also use it on my toe nail. Helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this OPI nail oil. I use it day and night. And it keeps my finger nail out of dry.</li>
    <li> I keep this at home and use it nightly before bed.  It keeps no chip nails healthy and cuticles moisturized.</li>
    <li> Really like this . Worked great as a dryer. Cuticles are always tough for me so I keep applying it.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product, really like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I use this every day after getting dressed.  It is not too oily and helps my dry hands and cuticles heal.</li>
