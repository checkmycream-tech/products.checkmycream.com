<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these. Colors look great and they come in very handy!</li>
    <li> Great product love it</li>
    <li> The variety of colors is nice, but they are for delicate bras. These are smaller extenders.</li>
    <li> Did the job, one was not made well. Wish they had all white ones</li>
    <li> Way easier and cheaper option than buying new bras if pregnant or gaining a little weight. I wish I had known about these a while back, would have saved&lt;br /&gt;Me buying a few bras. They were easy to just clip on or sew in if you want something more permanent</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like. Bra extenders for the fat women in your life! lol</li>
    <li> Only order these if you want 3-hook, 3 rows.  The item isn&#x27;t actually what&#x27;s described, and it&#x27;s not free to return them.  Why bother then?</li>
    <li> So many colors!  So cheap!</li>
    <li> These are the perfect addition to any bra that fits too tightly. There a two bras I have these won&#x27;t fit on, but they&#x27;re from Italy and don&#x27;t follow the US bra standard.</li>
    <li> These were nice and worked well for the price.  The extenders are a bit more narrow than my victoria secret bras, but they still work and feel fine.</li>
    <li> These work great with any kind of bra.. I have worn them with regular bras, nursing bras and sports bras and they work fantastic. It&#x27;s fun to have so many colors even though I know I will never use them all.</li>
    <li> careful with number of hooks, 2 or 3.  These must be compatible with bras owned.</li>
    <li> product is great easy way to make bra&#x27;s alittle bigger.</li>
    <li> Works very well on all my bras</li>
    <li> Great for using on bra&#x27;s that feel a little tight, don&#x27;t have to buy new ones as often...</li>
    <li> These work perfectly as designed. I recommend them if you want to give yourself just a bit more extra space without having to buy a new bra.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about bra extenders...you get a lot for a low price, each has 3 settings to expand. Great variety of colors, my girlfriend is very happy with them. Would Recommend to anyone who needs 2-loop bra extenders.</li>
    <li> excellent product.  Very happy w/ the experience w/ this seller.</li>
    <li> The quality of these extenders was fine, and a great deal for the price. My disappointment is while the picture shows all different colors and the title of the item uses the word &amp;#34;assortment&amp;#34; they really only sent me 4 colors, about 4 clasps of each, and they were not exactly the colors I would have picked if I had known they would only send 4 colors. Oh well, no one really sees them anyway, right?</li>
    <li> 37 weeks pregnant, still wearing all my cute colorful bras thanks to this product. (:&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as described. Incredibly useful, and costs the same as a two-piece set from other vendors...</li>
    <li> This is what was expected but the color variety I received was 3 different colors, tan, pink, fuchsia. Not happy</li>
    <li> Practical, with all colors</li>
    <li> you have more color choices</li>
    <li> After buying bras and month later I had gained a little more weight making the bras tight. These added that extra little bit of room I needed making my bras comfortable again</li>
    <li> Amazing !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I just recently bought 34 D Victoria secret bras without realizing that they would be so tight they cause me pain , discomfort and a red line around my entire mid section. So I bought these and might I say TOTAL WORTH IT !!! Took my bras from a 34 to a 36 and feel so much better. So glad I don&#x27;t have to buy new bras 😄</li>
    <li> Pregnant wife got these to extend bras. Worked very nicely-much cheaper than buying all new brassieres.</li>
    <li> I often use extenders in the afternoon and evening when bras seem uncomfortably tight. I had two colors: black and white. Sometimes color showed through my blouse. These have enough colors for an appropriate match to any outfit. They add just an inch or two. Some of the previous extenders added too much room and could not be adjusted down for a good fit. These are the best I&#x27;ve found. For some reason, a glasses cleaner is included. Useful, but odd.</li>
    <li> These are great. They don&#x27;t stretch like the ones I saw at Soma but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. The price can&#x27;t be beat and having all these colors is awesome.  Shipping was quick. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Pretty excited when these arrived but was bummed to see that while they did send me a variety of colors this is what I got (neon green, purple, nude and light pink). Was expecting to get what was pictured when ordered since there was no disclaimer about product differing from what was pictured. Bummed no black or white but thankfully nude should work fine. Overall product quality seems good and they serve their purpose well. Had I gotten at least 1 black would&#x27;ve given 4 stars...if I received what was pictured (1 of each color) would&#x27;ve given 5!</li>
    <li> These work very well.</li>
    <li> They are good and the width is good for not too wide bras.</li>
    <li> These seem to be well made and are very consistent in size and shape, which I take as a good sign. Lots of different skin tone options. I must admit I prefer the fun colors, but it&#x27;s a good price for so many extenders, I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
    <li> GREAT bra extenders, all colors and super price....only wish there were two or three white&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> great product, great price!</li>
    <li> These work great! I read mixed reviews but ordered them anyways. The price was great so if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product then it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but I am happy with it. The clasps don&#x27;t line up with all my bras but they are still usable. It doesn&#x27;t change the shape or anything like bunch up. I recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the extra money to buy new bras who have gained weight like myself. Bras can be pretty expensive so this is a quick fix to the problem. Only thing I would suggest to the maker of this product is to make the item just a little bit longer. That way we have more used out of them incase we gain more weight lol. But other than that they do work wonderful and has saved me money and time. I also love the different colors.</li>
    <li> Nice variety of colors!  These make my bras more comfortable to wear.  Nice price.  Btw they fit victoria secret bras perfectly.</li>
    <li> The picture shows 17 colors but you don&#x27;t get 17 colors.You only get a couple. Since there is no disclaimer stating you won&#x27;t get all 17 colors I believe it is fraud. I was given a refund on the purchase price but not for the shipping but at least I got some satisfaction.</li>
    <li> A must have during a pregnancy! These are extending the life of my bras, saving a ton of $$$!!! Great product!</li>
    <li> Good deal for a variety of colors</li>
    <li> theyre ok just they do not stretch and theyre not long so they dont make too mkuch difference</li>
    <li> Awesome! I have sets of these in 3-hook and 2-hook in my lingerie drawer and in my luggage in case I ever need them. Got all of the colors shown and no duplicates. Have worn several and they held up just fine. Seriously great purchase for the price and now I&#x27;m not hunting for one when I need it.</li>
    <li> slightly smaller than my straps but still work fine</li>
    <li> Love all the colors and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Received items faster than I had thought, ALWAYS A PLUS! I look forward to using them. I have expensive bras but they had gotten just a tad snug, these will indeed come in handy!</li>
    <li> Some items were defective. Contacted Amazon and within minutes Amazon  resolved the issue.</li>
    <li> I love Bra&#x27;s and have a bunch of them in various colors, I got a little fatter, bought these extenders and saved me tons of money because now my Bra&#x27;s fit again.  Arrived quickly, excellent quality, easy to attach and very low cost.  Problem Solved!  I also bought the assortment of 3 Hooks which worked just as well on my 3 latch Bra&#x27;s.  Would recommend to other&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> No complaints.  I received all the colors as advertised.  They fit nicely and function as intended.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Life savers I&#x27;ve gotten wider boo who</li>
    <li> They work. They may not be a perfect match or the exact width, but they do what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
    <li> The bras I have to use these on have wider straps so the clips are not lined up quite right. However, it&#x27;s so minimal that it doesn&#x27;t bother me or irritate my back in any way.</li>
    <li> Great price, product is good</li>
    <li> What a great deal! Perfect for extending new high quality bras until they (inevitably) stretch to fit you more accurately. They&#x27;re also perfect for the inevitable winter time pudging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought extenders in other brands but these ones held up the best. They don&#x27;t end up stretching as much as other brands. I&#x27;ve accidentally thrown my bras in the drier on medium heat and the hooks on these stayed fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the variety in colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very worth purchase!</li>
    <li> You want 3 row 2 hook extenders? Well this is exactly what these are. They fit Panache and Cleo bra claps perfectly. It&#x27;s really a luck of the draw situation if you&#x27;re looking for a color that isn&#x27;t beige/white/black but you do get a nice variety of hues.</li>
    <li> These fit all standard 2-hook bras. Terrific variety of colors. Well made. Should do the trick for anyone between bra sizes. Very comfortable.</li>
    <li> These worked fine for the purpose needed.  Hooks were kind of small so hard to hook</li>
    <li> Every needed color in the assortment.  Not to big, just right to work with almost any bra you have.</li>
    <li> I like them. Nice assortment of colours and they fit OK. Issue is is small cheated ladies have thin bands. These are made for a bit thicker bands, BUT the still fit and it&#x27;s not uncomfortable to make them fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package had all the options shown in the photo so getting only a few colours must be old practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars for packaging. Each hook was in a seperate bag and ir was a bit of a pain to open all the bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had one hook options.</li>
    <li> Love it!! This was a great deal for 17 pieces!!</li>
    <li> Fits my bras perfectly.</li>
    <li> Every color was true to the color  love them beautiful and they work</li>
    <li> Some people have complained they only got 2-3 colors.. However, I&#x27;ve received 17 different colors! The only slight gripe I have are my bras are spaced slightly different but they still work and haven&#x27;t fallen off. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I thought it had a combination of narrow width extenders not wide width. Sorry...</li>
    <li> this item is exactly as discribed. i am very satisfied. thank you.</li>
    <li> They are durable.  I love the variety of colors available.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase both for the price and the selection I received.</li>
    <li> Not quite the tight sizes i needed them for</li>
    <li> They do the job just right. Nice colors as well</li>
    <li> I love these soooo much like I can finally wear cute bras without worrying about looking bad in them! So comfy :)</li>
    <li> This Product Came In Time &amp;&lt;br /&gt;It Came With So Many Colors and I Love It.</li>
    <li> This was a good buy, granted I only needed the skin tones and black extenders... for the price, it was still a better value even for just those colors.</li>
    <li> This works like you would expect them to.  You get a variety of colors at a really good price.  It takes awhile to get the product, but for the price and quantity...you can&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Nothing really special about them but they do their job.</li>
    <li> Great product and great selection of colors, this is a true bargin.</li>
    <li> Very usefully and convenience with different colors. Awesome!</li>
    <li> very cheaply made and they bunch up which shows through the tops.</li>
    <li> I only needed the tan color but bought the set since it included so many for less cost than a 3 pack in another brand.  I got these because my rib cage expanded so much during pregnancy that my bras no longer fit.  They worked great.  I will pass out the extra colors to friends when they get preggo and have the same issue.  They&#x27;re very comfortable, can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing them.  But they come unattached in the washer and dryer so be careful to watch for that so you don&#x27;t lose them.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors; product works!</li>
    <li> So Many Colors, You can always find one that is closest to what you need.&lt;br /&gt;They fit all my bras including Victoria Secret.&lt;br /&gt;It is 3 rows of 2-hooks. It adds about an extra 1-1/2 inch to your bra size.&lt;br /&gt;Measuring from the center of one hook to the center of the other hook, the hooks are spaced at 1/2-inch (13-mm) .</li>
    <li> These are great. I was worried about which colors I would receive but they are awesome! Best part is that they work well with my Victoria&#x27;s Secret bras and they are well made. They are also much softer than the other brand that I own and I cannot feel any difference between the extender and my bra band. Yay!  The only complaint I would have is that the space between the eye hooks is a bit more narrow than .5&amp;#34; but it is very easy to gently bend them a bit further apart. Otherwise, these are perfect and the price is unbeatable. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> While I was out of town at an outlet mall, I got measured and bought a bunch of bras in my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; size.  Turns out I was measured incorrectly. Just when I thought I was going to have to go buy more bras and yell at the salesperson, I found these.  They work great!  These easily expand my 34s to 36s.  I guess if you needed to, you could use more than one to expand your bra strap even further, you&#x27;d just need to have the correct cup size.</li>
    <li> This fits all my bras! Even if the bra is a little wider or thinner it still hooks on and stays in place.</li>
    <li> These extenders work great! The spacing between the hooks is a little smaller than some of my bras but they can still be used comfortably. Also the color options are beyond amazing, there are even multiple shades of tan/nude!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t line up with the VS Pink bras I wear.</li>
    <li> These are just what I needed and they meet my expectations</li>
    <li> The hook spacing is way off from any bra I own..</li>
    <li> I move them thank you</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly. Was afraid I&#x27;d make a mistake but didn&#x27;t. Your extenders and my bras mesh just right. This being the first time I tried something of this sort is why I thought I&#x27;d make an error. It&#x27;s neat to have multiple colors! Thought that wasn&#x27;t needed at first, but after having used it I want more colors now LOL (give &#x27;em an inch &amp; they take a mile ...)&lt;br /&gt;Advise everyone whose bra is &amp;#34;shrinking&amp;#34; but they love that bra so want to continue to wear it, not a new one, to get these!</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of colors. These cost so much less than other retailers.</li>
    <li> Perfect for women in between sizes.</li>
    <li> These were a total bra saver! The package arrived a few days early and exactly as described and seen in the pictures. I am So glad I bough these, well worth the $5.59!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro’s:&lt;br /&gt;They match all my bra colors &amp; the hooks fit all my bra clasps&lt;br /&gt;They are soft enough you don’t notice them (they don&#x27;t itch or anything)&lt;br /&gt;They make your bras more comfortable to wear&lt;br /&gt;They stay hooked nicely but are not difficult to hook and unhook when needed&lt;br /&gt;They’re very well made and sturdy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: NONE Ive been using them on various bras (leaving them hooked) and they are all very well made for such a low price, I haven&#x27;t found anything wrong with them! :)</li>
    <li> These are ideal and fit all my bras and are great for pregnancy or weight gain instead of replacing all your bras</li>
    <li> While the price and color choices are great, my bra came unhooked five times at work. Needle nose plyers to tighten the closures helped, but V. S. bras do not love these extenders</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for what I needed, though the spacing isn&#x27;t exact for all of my bras.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this purchase. It was an absolute steal. They are great quality and I got the perfect colors (I know it&#x27;s random) but still my bras match it.</li>
    <li> WOW.. After searching for a good 3 pack or 4 pack in retail stores for 9 or $10... I found this GEM of 17/pc for less than 6 bucks... BEST DEAL EVER. Not only does it bring a variety of colors but the hooks fit my bras perfectly. This says 17 but I think they sent me 19... In a perfect plastic Baggie even came with a dust cloth idk for what but oh well! Btw ladies this is a TWO PRONG extender not THREE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and love the number of extenders you get for the price. When I wash them sometimes I misplace them, but since so many are in a package I can grab more out of the package and be able to run out the door in the morning rather than struggle to look for them right at that moment. Previously I bought the 5 pack from a different company and found they just weren&#x27;t enough. These are perfect.</li>
    <li> They serve the purpose, I just find it uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Omg I love these.  The are a perfect fit for Victoria&#x27;s Secret bras.</li>
    <li> I bought the 3 hook as well as these two hook extenders and for the price you cant beat it. A great assortment of colors.</li>
    <li> I got these to expand my bras while pregnant. They work great and saved me a fortune in new bras.</li>
    <li> The white piece came in dirty.  Besides that great deal!</li>
    <li> I found these to be of good quality. The one problem I found is that I didn&#x27;t get the colors that were shown in the picture. I didn&#x27;t get even 1 black. I got three of the light purple...and I don&#x27;t even have a bra of that color to use them with. So some colors were not included and others I got too many of. But if you just need something that works...this pack is a good price.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t fit any of my bras.  I live in the USA.  I guess bras are different wherever these were made.</li>
    <li> I love these extenders. I got all 17 assorted colors as shown in the ad. They work perfect for all of my bras VS or other bras. If the one extender does not do the job I will attach another. If your top isn&#x27;t  see thru who would know (yea, gained a little weight). The shipping was quite fast. Exactly what I was looking for, and without having to buy new bras. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller I recommend both!</li>
    <li> Absolutely worthless.  These extenders are not standard sizes for bras.  I have a larger 2 hook spacer and a smaller one, and these extenders are too big and too small.  Waste of time and money.  I&#x27;m hoping I can return them.</li>
    <li> These are great to have. Helped out perfectly with a bra too tight. Nice to have all different colors.</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of colors and gives me just enough extra room; I can&#x27;t go up a size, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  This is my solution.</li>
    <li> Worked great for pregnancy!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to give 4.5 stars but what&#x27;s half a star here or there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there are 17 extenders. They have only 2 hooks which attach to the loop fixtures of your bra. There are 3 sets of loops on the other side which fit into the hooks in your bra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extenders are shorter than I ones I purchased before. They only have 1 set of hooks, not 3 so obviously, they need less material. If you are using yours at maximum extension, these might be too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hook up two of these to gain extra length but the hooks and loops aren&#x27;t that tight. If the tension drops, the whole thing might unhook. While you are wearing the garment. This is the reason why I wanted to give 4.5 stars and not 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my bras which use 3 hook/loops to close - you can use these. Just have to squeeze the hooks/loops close enough together to get them join. It is a touch scratchy since the material is bunched up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do not contain any elastic - for some reason my other extenders do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are standard - white, beige, pink, lavender, pale blue, red, black - you get two of each more or less&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are really easy to lose - in the wash- in the lingerie drawer.  Haven&#x27;t lost any while wearing, not yet : )</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for what I wanted.  So, it&#x27;s a lot of hook extenders.  I really didn&#x27;t need this many in a million different colors, but . . .for the price and free shipping, it was perfect.  They don&#x27;t line up exactly with all my bras, but they don&#x27;t bunch majorly either and still work for me.  I&#x27;m pregnant and trying to avoid purchasing 5 million different pieces of clothing as my body expands, and so far these are great to get more use out of my existing bras.  I only really have 1 black bra and several white bras, but I&#x27;m not concerned about matching white with white or black with black only.  Unless I am  wearing a see through top, no reason why I can&#x27;t match a red extender with a white bra.  Weirdly enough, this comes with what appears to be a lens cleaning cloth.  Maybe it&#x27;s something else that makes sense to bra aficionados (which I&#x27;m not), but I don&#x27;t get it.  Regardless, we have plenty of sunglasses we can use it to clean.</li>
    <li> Work great.  Provides the extra width needed for a more comfortable fit.</li>
    <li> Great assortment, suitable for any double hook bra and durable</li>
    <li> My wife liked them. Said they did just what she was looking for in adding extra length to her Victoria Secret bra&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great product. Nice to have a looser fit.</li>
    <li> very short extension in length.  color are also very pale and mostly the same.  i would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I have bras in a lot of colors and locally I can only find extenders in nude, white, and black.  These fit my Victoria&#x27;s Secret bras well.  But each extender did come in it&#x27;s own little plastic pouch so i had to open 17 individual pouches.  not a big deal but a bit wasteful and time consuming.  I&#x27;ve recommended these to friends.</li>
    <li> They are worth every penny. Save me from tearing up my bras to make them looser. I have a problem with tight things around my chest and I am not over weight but have problems with finding the right cup size with inches.</li>
    <li> Excellent solution for expensive bras that are now too tight.</li>
    <li> These are very small. If you only need an extra inch of length, these are ok, but that is pretty much it. They are soft, but the hooks and eyes are tiny and the space between each row (not rows for adding length, but the width between the two hooks on the same row) is narrower than most regular bras. May be a good size for a girl or teenager&#x27;s training bra.</li>
    <li> Do what they&#x27;re supposed to do and I&#x27;ll always have the right color (although all my bras are black).  I don&#x27;t mind having a small patch that doesn&#x27;t match.  No one will see it anyway.</li>
    <li> Wish it had included red!!!!!!</li>
    <li> works nicely. exactly what i needed and i love all the colors available.</li>
    <li> I bought these to make my bra more comfortable during pregnancy.  Normally I buy a whole new set of bras when I&#x27;m pregnant, but with these hooks, I&#x27;m comfortable despite my rib cage expanding.  Such a blessing!</li>
    <li> Hooks are off from bras so they either come unhooked or cause a bulge. Both are uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Great assortment of bra strap extensions</li>
    <li> great assortment, a little smaller than I had anticipated, but still work.</li>
    <li> Great products for the price... would recommend to anyone that needs the extra space for a bra.. great value for the price and not cheap made products</li>
    <li> Very useful as l can now use my bras that no longer fit and plenty of colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> The product took two weeks to arrive from China. On opening the package, I noticed a formaldehyde odor that was very strong. The inner, paper box containing the bra extenders was wrapped in a sticky material that made opening difficult. The box inside did not protect the product from the odor, which seemed to originate from the packaging material. Therefore, I had to wash the extenders several times, by hand, in antibacterial soap, before using them. They smell fine now, and I use them everyday. Nice colors. Good value. However, I hope the seller will do something to improve the packaging and shorten the delivery time.</li>
    <li> Received all assorted colors. Great product. Purchased from Olivia&#x27;s Gift. Great seller!</li>
    <li> These are so much less expensive than similar products and they work great! They are actually a bit closer spaced than my bra but they work fine. They are also really comfortable. I like to use them when I get new bras because the band always stretches out after a few weeks so I actually need them to be tight when I first buy them.</li>
    <li> I love them They match all of my VS Bras which were a bit tight.  I save a lot of money and got to keep my Favorite bras.</li>
    <li> If you are like me you hate trying on a bra before you buy it, or buy it online only for it to show up a little to small. Well tada these little hooks of happiness fix that, and fix that bad mood for buying something no one reviewed stating it &amp;#34;runs small&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;On a side note the colors are true to the photo and they are not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No I have not received any discount for my opinion it is 100% unbiased.</li>
    <li> What a bargain!  You hey sup many fpr v the price!</li>
    <li> Great product, altho I prefer to purchase items made in the USA.</li>
    <li> So happy that I bought this. So many colors and just as good as any other brands of this I&#x27;ve seen. Plus WAY more for the same price or less? Ace in my book.</li>
    <li> Good quality all the color are bright and the material use for is soft fir the price can&#x27;t bet it ! Shipping was fast&lt;br /&gt;Thanks 👍</li>
    <li> super fast delivery. I gained weight and have a nice little collection of different color bras in good condition still. These are perfect.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit...returned &amp; received a refund almost immediately......thanks</li>
    <li> Arrived well before promised (wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be shipped from overseas). These bra extenders will last a long, long time and am glad I ordered them. They&#x27;re great in making a tight bra a lot more comfortable. Highly recommend ordering.</li>
    <li> Have you tried on every bra size, only to find that none of them fit you?  After years of struggling to find any bra that would fit me correctly, these extenders have made my life 100% better.  Now I can by the 36C bras found in any store, add the extender and have the perfect fit!  The stay securely and are easy to put on and take off.</li>
    <li> Fit as expected, various colors is a plus, fast shipping and handling. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was so happy with this purchase. It came with so many colors! And they seem like good quality so far.</li>
    <li> My wife loves them. Initially she was skeptical because of her large bra size, but they make her VERY HAPPY!</li>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t standard even within one package, but still they work well and definitely extend the life of my bras.</li>
    <li> They work great. There were about 20 of them in the package, didn&#x27;t know I would get that many.</li>
    <li> Great price and all of them work great!  Thank you so much for such great product!  Now I can breath without buying new bras!</li>
    <li> Rust.  Careful when wash and dry.Could be a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Love these!!!  So many colors and so inexpensive!! Gives just enough &amp;#34;breathing room&amp;#34;!!</li>
    <li> Plenty of colors, easy to use, and fits all of my bras. Standard two clip bras, and for a fraction of the price of what I would pay in stores.</li>
    <li> I am highly impressed by these little bra extenders! I got 17 for $6.99 when everyone else wants $6.50-$8.99 for just 3!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this is a great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not too sure why people have had such a problem getting these to fit their bras... They fit all of my bras just fine except for the one bra I have that has a very skinny clasp area. I have yet to find any really skinny extenders so if anyone knows of any please let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I am on the smaller end of being a B-cup, so it is untrue that you need to have bigger breasts and bra sizes to use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a little bit shorter than traditional bra extenders, so if you need quite a bit added onto your bra you may have to use two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for them rubbing and irritating your back, they only do that if you still have your bra tightened too tight with them. I found this out the hard way. I would recommend adding a second one on if you are having this issue. Once I added a second one to one of my smaller bras the irritation issue was resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these! Although, definitely pay attention to the size and shape of your bra&#x27;s clasps before purchasing these! :)</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and was as described.</li>
    <li> I only needed one extender, but being as I&#x27;m between band sizes, I thought I&#x27;d spring for this larger package since I might need more later. They fit the bra in question (Panache Andorra Plunge) perfectly. Only wish they had more of my favorite colors, like dark red, medium blue, turquoise, or green, or more muted tones. But, I know they tried to match what&#x27;s out there in the bra world, and of those, only dark red is actually common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extenders seem sturdy and don&#x27;t irritate my skin, though they aren&#x27;t ultra-plush either. I like that they are non-stretch, so they don&#x27;t compromise the support of a strong, snug band by immediately becoming the &amp;#34;weakest link&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all came packed together into a sturdy recloseable bag, which was a nice bonus for actually being able to find them in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase the 3-hook version, if I ever find a 3-hook bra that&#x27;s the right shape for me.</li>
    <li> Finally, I have a choice outside of black, beige, and white. These are awesome!</li>
    <li> I now have an extender for any color bra I might have</li>
    <li> Really helps in increasing the size of the strap. I am able to use all my old and favorite bras that I was about to discard.&lt;br /&gt;Completely stays in place. Really helpful for temporary weight gain or during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> worked very well! cool colors!</li>
    <li> Does what it was designed to do!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Good quality too!</li>
    <li> great color choices for an extender</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my teenage daughter. They do come well made, and my daughter loved them. She had some bras that would fit tight while she loved the way the cup shaped her. The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because they don&#x27;t come in many colors. They send you doubles of them. And most of them seem like pastel colors, not vibrant colors. But all in all, I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Works great and love the colors.</li>
    <li> Cheap bunch of bra extenders. Great for pregnancy when you don&#x27;t want to invest in new bras but don&#x27;t quote fit the regulars.</li>
    <li> These work incredibly well, no discomfort and I love that the colors match almost everything! Great value and very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Because I was able to add these to my existing bras to get the length I needed, I saved a ton of money.  I would have needed to purchase 40B&#x27;s which is a specialty size that starts at about $30 a bra.</li>
    <li> A wide range of colors and spaced perfectly to fit my Coobie brand bras. Just that extra bit of breathing room.</li>
    <li> I needed bra extenders for  2 clasps bras and particularly a colored one. I ordered this set for that color and got way more than I needed but it I&#x27;m covered for a lifetime and any color I will ever need is in this set. They work great and are good quality.</li>
    <li> Not as advertised! Instead of receiving a 3 hook extender you will receive a 2 hook on one end and 3 hooks on the other end. Bras  are not made that way. They tend to be 3 hooks on one side and 3 hooks on the other side unless the bra is also not well made</li>
    <li> Made as expected and do the trick.</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased these. Perfect! it is hard to find two loop extenders and these work great.</li>
    <li> I only got 6 different colors, and it was missing the black one! The only reason I got this package is to get 3 basic colors - black, white and beige, and maybe some different colors just in case. Mine only has one beige, one white, no black and a BUNCH of reds, violets and burgundy for which I didn&#x27;t care!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side - the quality is not bad, they&#x27;re soft and comfy to wear.</li>
    <li> The loops are just a little bit closer together than the hooks on any of my bras, so they take some getting used to.  However, the fabric is thick and the stitching seems very sturdy.  They work great!  And the colors are perfect.</li>
    <li> The actual quality of these things is great. I&#x27;m ecstatic to have so many for such a great price!! However, instead of getting a black one (the one I needed most...), I got two navy ones. I don&#x27;t think this is too terrible though, since no one will see them anyway.</li>
    <li> I did receive 17 items and they are of good quality.  However, the colors shown are deceptive.  I received 5 different colors not the variety shown.  It will work for me, but I wish there had been more variety as shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> This does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> great deal and they do the job......now if i could just start exercising so i dont need them anymore!!!</li>
    <li> Glad to find these bra hook extensions, and to have all the colors that match my bras.</li>
    <li> Save money and just adjust the bras you have.</li>
    <li> The colors are great, but these things took over a month to arrive.  In the meantime, I ordered some standard ones (1 black, 1 white, 1 nude), and have never switched over.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> fit VS bras just fine!</li>
    <li> So handy - good deal - you don&#x27;t find these items any more in nearby stores.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to locate them - saved the day!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of colors for good price but these will only extend a few centimetres as they have no elastic. The ones with the elastic parts provide much better fit but i guess those only come in basic colors like black, white and nude.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly to fix the slightly uncomfortable band around my Victoria Secret bras. I thought I would have to buy new ones for an upcoming vacation, but these solved my problem. The colors are great!  I don&#x27;t even know the extender is there.</li>
    <li> The sets do not even match.  If you have a red bra you would need to use red on one side and something else on the other since there isn&#x27;t a red one for the other side.  Horrible!</li>
    <li> So many colors!! 😍 it&#x27;s awesome! Definatly worth it!</li>
    <li> The buckle/clasps are not tight. But this is easily fixed by squeezing them tighter with pliers or your teeth.</li>
    <li> Works just like you think it would.</li>
    <li> It would be great if more white/beige/black colors were included instead of the more rare colors. But works great for extending bras instead of going out and buying new ones.</li>
    <li> Items as advertised. Colors match or compliment many Victoria&#x27;s Secret bras.  Have been wearing and laundering them for two months.  Less expensive than purchasing extenders individually.  A far cheaper method of dealing with seasonal weight gain than purchasing new, larger bras.</li>
    <li> I have put on a significant amount of weight after a recent surgery which made my bras extremely tight. I own several nice, expensive bras and I didn&#x27;t want to have to go out and buy a complete replacement set until I lose the weight. These extenders saved me from discomfort and from spending a ton of money. The colors really match up well to common bra colors and can be interchanged frequently without the clasps/hooks wearing out. I bought both with 3 row hooks and 2 row hooks.</li>
    <li> Lots of color shipped very quickly love them</li>
    <li> item arrived on time and as expected</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price</li>
    <li> I always seem to need that extra inch or two and these are perfect. It&#x27;s awesome that there are so many colors because now I can match all my bras and not worry about things not matching when the shirt is a tiny bit sheer.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for more color choices, got mostly pastels. I have bolder colored bras was trying to match colors... But the basic colors work fine.</li>
    <li> These have been great for my expanding pregnant ribcage. It really makes a difference in the comfort of the bra and helps remove that &amp;#34;bulge&amp;#34; on your back. The price is excellent for the number of extenders you get. They are a soft felt fabric and fit all of my bras well (mostly Victorias Secret). I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Just as described they work great and I get a ton of them!!!</li>
    <li> exactly as described and pictured. seem to be pretty sturdy. a great alternative to buying new bras if theyre just a little tight in the band!</li>
    <li> Now these were an awesome deal. Took a while to get here, but I couldn&#x27;t find any in a store and I wasn&#x27;t in a rush anyways. Now I have a surplus of these things!</li>
    <li> Love these good buy and they work perfect!</li>
    <li> Handy for when the only bra on sale is a size smaller and you still want to wear the cute bras!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product</li>
    <li> they serve their purpose by giving me some extra room in the back, but they dont stay on unless the bra is on you.  Put in the hamper still attached, and when I pulled it out to sort my laundry it was off.</li>
    <li> These colors where not in my package.  I got a lot of a yucky green color which is not even shown in the picture and not anything that I can use.  The picture shows mainly pastel colors but most of the colors I received where bright and no beige, white, light blue or lavender.  Mostly unusable for me if I want to even come close to matching the bras I own.</li>
    <li> Lots of great colors,and much less expensive than going to a fabric store where they only have 3 and 4 hook extenders.</li>
    <li> I got a big selection of colors, each extender is individually wrapped. The hooks are a little wider than the ones on my bras but they still work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When washing my bras (in a mesh bag) the extenders fall off. So if you don&#x27;t wash your bras in a bag these little guys may get lost. They have held up great through 4 washes so far.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, these work great!</li>
    <li> Came in a month earlier than expected, exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> While the delivery did take a little longer than you&#x27;d normally think, I was advised ahead of time so I can&#x27;t complain.  And, the color variety and sizing was perfect for almost all of my bras.  A great value.</li>
    <li> The hooks are so close together they did not fit most of my bras!  I wear a 34D so perhaps they are better for smaller bras!!! I had to pinch my bra together which created a small bulge.  The colors are fantastic and I can usually match pretty closely to my bra color.</li>
    <li> Great variety and even better price.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Not really much else to say. I actually did receive 17 different colors! Great buy. Great value!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful colors for camouflage. Well made to last.</li>
    <li> I loved the detailed measurements in the description. I was sure that I was getting the correct size to fit my bra. I&#x27;m pregnant and did not want to buy all new bras for only a couple of monthes. These are ideal for getting a temporary fit and since this pack has every color  at a great price, I can put one on each of my bras and forget about it.</li>
    <li> Great value for as many as you get and I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints about how they work so they must do their job.</li>
    <li> I found the eyes in these to not match up with many ofmy bras.</li>
    <li> Always the right color, plenty of beige / near beige, nice soft fabric, and now all those bras fit my in-between size!Good product all around and less money then other brands. Added bonus is a nice zip lock package to keep them in.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors. Work as described and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Work great with all my bras- life saver as I was pregnant. They prolonged a lot of my underwear&#x27;s life as I was changing sizes.</li>
    <li> Wrong size, but they work great....</li>
    <li> I received my order today and as you can see from the attached photo, I received some variation in color but not exactly what is pictured in the listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got, as you can see in the attached picture:&lt;br /&gt;1 light orangey-pink&lt;br /&gt;1 dusty rose pink&lt;br /&gt;1 black&lt;br /&gt;1 dark pink&lt;br /&gt;1 grey&lt;br /&gt;1 coral&lt;br /&gt;1 dark blue&lt;br /&gt;1 brown&lt;br /&gt;1 light blue&lt;br /&gt;1 dark purple&lt;br /&gt;1 pale pink&lt;br /&gt;1 slightly tan european nude&lt;br /&gt;5 pale european nude&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not receive light purple, red, white, or the blue-ish one in the center of the listing picture. If you are looking for a specific color or colors as pictured in the item listing, be aware that you may not receive them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly the quality looks good though I have not tried them out yet. I will update if there are significant problems with the quality after use.</li>
    <li> Wife loved the product.  Had enough colors that she could almost exactly match to what she needed.</li>
    <li> This bra expanders work perfect. I bought them when I became pregnant and my bras fit perfect in the cup but didn&#x27;t close in the back due to my body changing. I typically add one or two depending on how small the bra was in  first place.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why bra extenders are so expensive in stores, but they are. Even at my local Walmart a three-pack is about $6-- really? $2 per extender? These are exactly the same quality as anything sold in stores, and are super cheap. They arrived very quickly in a small ziplock bag (like the kind used for jewelry) in a padded envelope. If you wear mainly dark bras, this pack is not for you, but if you wear a lot of light bras, in the white to medium tan range, you&#x27;ll find that a lot of the extenders match your bra enough not to be a noticeably different color even under sheerer shirts.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed.  A great value for the money.</li>
    <li> They are ok, but they don&#x27;t stretch and they come off when you wash them. I bought some different ones that stretch that are better. Thank you though for all the different colors.</li>
    <li> Great buy. I always find the sexy, comfy bras in my cup size just not in my width. Now I have this I can have piece of mind when I buy my bra it Will fit perfect with these extension.</li>
    <li> Great purchase, but only got a few colors. Was hoping for a better assortment of colrs, but gets the job done!!!</li>
    <li> This is amazing, i loved it. Good quality</li>
    <li> great for stretching the wear of your current bras while waiting to lose the extra pounds we put on during the holidays, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Saves on buying all new bras</li>
    <li> Great, cheap buy! Works as expected. Definitely worth it and you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re using them.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  variety of colors to choose from, too, so you can easily find a match...  or at least something very close. I actually bought these to sew onto my garter belts to make them smaller... And I could not be more pleased how it worked out. Obviously I couldn&#x27;t just clip them, I had to sew them on the opposite end, but regardless, I&#x27;m very pleased. So ya, if you have a bra or anything with a bra closure that is now too big, these can be used as \\&quot;minimizers\\&quot;, too. Just a little extra work. 👌</li>
    <li> These worked exactly how I needed them to, 5 stars</li>
    <li> Not quite the width I was expecting but they&#x27;ll work on some bras.  Very fast, easy transaction.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I wanted.  Lots of colors just like the picture.  Work great too.</li>
    <li> My biggest complaint about this pack is there are not enough dark colors and way too many nude colors that I will never need. The only other problem is that the clasps are just a little further apart than Victoria&#x27;s Secret bras. It makes it a little hard to clasp, but I imagine this helps them stay attached all day. The usually stay on in the washer, but sometimes come off, so watch out or you might lose them.</li>
    <li> Has a lot of colors but none that matched the bras that it was used for.</li>
