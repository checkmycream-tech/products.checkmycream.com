      <li>it&#x27;s a nice light clean scent.</li>

      <li>This is hands down the best hair care product!</li>
      <li>This may be fine for men&#x27;s hair care, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this product if I had longer hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>Tried this because my hair is fine and could use some thickening.  </li>
      <li>It seems to do a good job as far as the texture of hair.</li>
      <li>Upgraded to Davines and have noticed significant improvement.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
      <li>I have been using this conditioner for quite a while  Really like it!!</li>
      <li>and I really like that it&#x27;s sulfate free.  </li>
      <li>I think the product is good, but it doesn&#x27;t give my hair the result I expected.</li>
      <li>This has been wonderful for my thin hair.</li>
      <li>I love how this product makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>We all need it, right?  </li>
      <li>My hair looked thicker right away.</li>
      <li>Great for fine, thin hair.</li>
      <li>I am bummed that I have to find a new product- one that is sulfate free as this is, but I will not be supporting animal cruelty.</li>
      <li>I just used this for the first time this morning.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a rash exactly</li>
      <li>pretty so now I tried another version of it without the rosemary</li>
      <li>Gives my thin hair great texture and it looks like I have a lot more hair than I actually have.</li>
      <li>Finally a shampoo and conditioner for fine hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of this.  </li>
      <li>I really like the shampoo from this line, but I&#x27;m not too fond of the conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It smells like shampoo, not a nasty smell or anything, just not much of a smell.  </li>
      <li>and you should feel your hair getting much thicker.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>This conditions really well.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s working, although I can&#x27;t attribute it to this one product specifically - I&#x27;m using the whole set.</li>
      <li>Makes my thinning hair much thicker</li>
      <li>This shampoo really works.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s really improving my scalp or not</li>
      <li>the rosemary smell is a bit too much.</li>
      <li>This does a pretty good job, but the smell is not nice at all!</li>
      <li>It has a really strong smell that lingers even after your hair is dry.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately the tubes don&#x27;t come with much soap either -- about three weeks worth in my experience, and I need a good amount of it to feel like it&#x27;s covering my whole head.  </li>
      <li>but it makes me feel better knowing it has less chemicals and better than other shampoos.</li>
      <li>This conditioner, as most conditioners do, made my hair even softer, slicker, and less manageable than it would be without conditioner.  </li>
      <li>You get what you pay for with hair products, and I would suggest getting something a little better.</li>
      <li>Smells very well and lives the hair soft.  </li>
      <li>It worked well the first time I used it, but after using it daily for about a week, I could really tell the difference in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I buy in different variations just for a fun.  </li>
      <li>Might work for other hair types, but I do not recommend it for problem fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I live in FL so it need no help in that dept</li>
      <li>Plus, everyone tells me how much more soft and fluffy my hair is</li>
      <li>I recently started using the sulfate free shampoo as all the regular shampoo&#x27;s did a number on my scalp.</li>
      <li>I do not usually have sensitive skin issues.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s odd that this is mostly marketed to women; there&#x27;s definitely a scent</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> if anything, this shampoo made my hair limper and thinner.  disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, but recently discovered that L&#x27;Oreal is guilty of animal testing. I am bummed that I have to find a new product- one that is sulfate free as this is, but I will not be supporting animal cruelty.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment on how well this works or not because I used it once and am going to have to trash the rest of the bottle.  It smells AWFUL.  I like rosemary and mint scent generally, but I don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like Deep Woods OFF! or bad men&#x27;s cologne all day.  I thought it would fade as my hair dried, but no such luck.  It&#x27;s unbearable and I get a whiff every time I turn my head.    I really like the blue L&#x27;Oreal curl version of this conditioner and thought it made my curly hair look healthier than it has in quite awhile.  Tried this because my hair is fine and could use some thickening.  Won&#x27;t be straying again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it did anything to prevent weak hair from falling out. Left my hair on the dry side if anything and didn&#x27;t add much volume or thickness. Upgraded to Davines and have noticed significant improvement. You get what you pay for with hair products, and I would suggest getting something a little better.</li>
    <li> Due to a skin condition I decided to switch to gentler soaps without sulfates.  This L&#x27;Oreal is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve found so far.  Upon using it my scalp became much less inflamed, itchy and irritated after I shower (I formerly used Pert), and I feel comfortable enough to let it sit in my hair for a few minutes.  Facial and body acne also disappeared.  Plus, everyone tells me how much more soft and fluffy my hair is now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s odd that this is mostly marketed to women; there&#x27;s definitely a scent but it doesn&#x27;t persist beyond the shower.  Unfortunately the tubes don&#x27;t come with much soap either -- about three weeks worth in my experience, and I need a good amount of it to feel like it&#x27;s covering my whole head.  This may be fine for men&#x27;s hair care, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this product if I had longer hair.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.. makes her hair look and feel good.. good price for this product.</li>
    <li> This smells terrible to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s working, although I can&#x27;t attribute it to this one product specifically - I&#x27;m using the whole set. My hair feels thicker, at the very least! The conditioner isn&#x27;t my favorite, because it feels thin to me, but I like the set.</li>
    <li> Makes my thinning hair much thicker and I really like that it&#x27;s sulfate free.  Leaves my hair strong and silky.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Just not for my cooler treated hair!</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo.  I buy in different variations just for a fun.  We all need it, right?  Smells very well and lives the hair soft.  I always buy the shampoo and the conditioner together.  Works great for me.</li>
    <li> This has been wonderful for my thin hair. It leaves softness without being heavy.  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products and they don&#x27;t work half as well.</li>
    <li> Came in the mail without any problems! Love using it on my hair!</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time this morning.  My hair does feel lighter.  I like my hair to smell fruity, so I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of this.  It smells like shampoo, not a nasty smell or anything, just not much of a smell.  If it smelled like apples I&#x27;d like it more. My hair does feel soft though.  I used it in combination with the conditioner.  I think maybe a couple more uses then mist some fruity perfume over my hair lol.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It leaves my hair feeling fuller and not greasy.  It&#x27;s easy to comb through afterwards and my hair styles great after I use it!</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s sulfate-free, that it&#x27;s thick and works well, it does give me a good volume. Great by! I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
    <li> Sub &amp; save service is always great. But the product its self wasnt. Not the first time a loreal product has let me down.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, hate the conditioner.  Smells like a man&#x27;s product.  Would it really be hard to make this smell at least pleasant?  Actually makes my hair slightly frizzy and I&#x27;ve never had frizzy hair in my life.</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo from this line, but I&#x27;m not too fond of the conditioner.  It has a really strong smell that lingers even after your hair is dry. I also didn&#x27;t notice it making my hair any thicker.</li>
    <li> Sincerely, I cannot picture life without this stuff. Little about me, been battling an incurable disease which happens to not allow me to absorb vitamins. Was put on chemo and lost a lot of hair... I mean a lot! My hair was so thin and brittle. After having a very bad reaction, I was taken off chemo and all I wanted to do was reclaim my hair. I went for a day to be pampered at hair salon after they assured me chemo had no affect on treatments and the girl over processed what little hair I had left AND cut off about 4 inches. I was bawling my eyes out. Terrible!!! Anyway, I wanted to go chem free and cut out dead stuff and keep my hair virgin. I am about 4 inches away from all virgin hair and this stuff is to blame!!! My hair grew back so fast and it came in so healthy. I do not use anything with alcohol and I get a trim every month. To date, I can wash my hair with just the shampoo... conditioner is not even needed but I use anyway. It is a MUST buy!! Chemo and over processed/ burnt hair was no match for this stuff. It is the BEST and smells wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> I recently started using the sulfate free shampoo as all the regular shampoo&#x27;s did a number on my scalp. I like this one as it really cleans out the hair perfectly. I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s really improving my scalp or not but it makes me feel better knowing it has less chemicals and better than other shampoos.</li>
    <li> This does a pretty good job, but the smell is not nice at all! It smells like flea shampoo for dogs and it lingers until you shampoo with something else. It seems to do a good job as far as the texture of hair. I wish they would make it smell better!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best hair care product! I have used expensive salon products that leave my sensitive skin itchy and my long, fine norwegian hair either flat and oily or tangled beyond belief. It is hard to find in the store. Thank you Amazon for the great deal on this elusive and awesome product!!</li>
    <li> I have very thin and very fine hair.  This conditioner, as most conditioners do, made my hair even softer, slicker, and less manageable than it would be without conditioner.  I could not see any thickening effect for that matter .  I tried using less than recommended, but the effect was still too softening for my already limp hair.  Might work for other hair types, but I do not recommend it for problem fine hair.  I used the L&#x27;Oreal thickening shampoo with the L&#x27;Oreal thickening conditioner and thickening tonic.  None of the three products worked for me, either together or separately.</li>
    <li> Like the smell and how my hair felt after using.</li>
    <li> Have used L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong &amp; EverPure products for years - like that they are sulfate-free.  Amazon has the best prices.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores (although they stock it now at random stores).  It helped a lot after surgery which thins your hair</li>
    <li> Finally a shampoo and conditioner for fine hair. It really is the best and I have tried sooo many it&#x27;s ridiculous. This product makes my hair feel healthy while adding thickness and body. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> My hair looked thicker right away. Loving the styling. The smell is also so refreshing and lovely. Don&#x27;t ever stop making this.</li>
    <li> good product but for me the rosemary smell is a bit too much. But indeed keeps your hair soft and pretty so now I tried another version of it without the rosemary and that is perfect.</li>
    <li> They sent me the update newest version which only has Rosemary instead of Rosemary and mint and is a lighter green version. This picture ahould be updated. Now I have a conditioner that makes my more of my hair fall.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  It makes my hair seem thicker and feels softer!  I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Like the conditioner,  but hard to get used to smelling like men&#x27;s aftershave!</li>
    <li> one of my go to hair products</li>
    <li> I like this. My hair is stronger.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this because my hair is thinning.I like the fullness it gives my hair but it also makes my hair feel dry and flyaway. I have curly dry hair to begin with. I have been using hair one for curly hair which I LOVE the way my hair feels and behaves.I just thought this conditioner and shampoo might be similar . I do like the way it smells and I LOVE L&#x27;oreal products, I just don&#x27;t think I will use this product often.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  Love it.  Gives my thin hair great texture and it looks like I have a lot more hair than I actually have.</li>
    <li> This conditions really well.  I&#x27;m not sure how much thicker my hair looks, as it&#x27;s been a week.  HOWEVER, I have bumps all over the back of my neck where my long hair lays.  It&#x27;s not a rash exactly, it&#x27;s like the pores are clogged (yet not acne).  I&#x27;ve never had these before and haven&#x27;t changed anything else except this conditioner and the matching shampoo.  I do not usually have sensitive skin issues.  Since there are no bumps on my scalp, I believe it&#x27;s the conditioner and not the shampoo (as I don&#x27;t put conditioner on my scalp).  I wanted to like this.  I&#x27;ll probably continue to use the shampoo but I&#x27;ll buy a different conditioner.</li>
    <li> Works good and is sulfate free.  Makes my hair feel good.</li>
    <li> i like the smell of this and the texture of the conditioner. cannot attest to the fact that after using it my hair is thicker...</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner that I have found.  It works better than even the best &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; conditioner I have used for years.  It worked well the first time I used it, but after using it daily for about a week, I could really tell the difference in my hair.  I have thin, fine, straight hair that gets tangled even when I&#x27;m just sitting.  My hair feels and looks much better - it will never be perfect, but I&#x27;ll continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I think the product is good, but it doesn&#x27;t give my hair the result I expected. I guess in shampoo and conditioner you have to go try and error. It has a minty smell.</li>
    <li> I generally change between a few very expensive shampoo/conditioner sets with Moroccan Oil Shampoo/Conditioner being my favorite for shine and strength but it also weighs my hair down. I live in FL so it need no help in that dept. I have fine hair but a lot of it.  My head starts looking like a mop when it gets heavy and it becomes impossible to clean.  I got this stuff because I ran out of what I buy offline or at Ulta.  I love it. I don&#x27;t like all of the ingredients to be honest but it works.  I use it followed by Moroccan oil and so far its great results. I might stick with it.  It seems to work well and I can run up to the grocery store to get it.</li>
    <li> Just buy Shea Moisture</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for about 3 months. I love how this product makes my hair soft and shiny. The scent is rosemary mint it&#x27;s a nice light clean scent. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The product worked nicely but IMHO it smelled terrible.</li>
    <li> Workd as expected!  Great product along with the Shampoo and Thickening Tonic!  Love the three together and recommend it to all who want their hair to be a bit thicker.</li>
    <li> Great for fine, thin hair. Good volume. Good smell. Thick, but not too heavy. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker--it can&#x27;t un-thin your hair--but it&#x27;s a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for quite a while  Really like it!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works. Give it a few months and you should feel your hair getting much thicker. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Very nice light smell</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Smells great and leaves hair soft and does what it says!</li>
