      <li>Not so in love with the price point</li>
      <li>I love this organizer to the fullest.  </li>
      <li>Looks so much better and is so much more convenient.</li>
      <li>My counter top was beginning to look like a Sephora shop.</li>
      <li>Top hairspray or candle.</li>
      <li>It was an okay product, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Perfect for organizing our teenage daughter&#x27;s bathroom.  </li>
      <li>For $60 I would expect better quality.</li>
      <li>Make more room on your counter and comes assembled.</li>
      <li>I was going to put this on top of my dresser, but I decided to use it in the kitchen instead.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice product and can really be used for men or women and even children.</li>
      <li>I ended up placing this under my bathroom sink to hold all my extras and it works pretty good.</li>
      <li>This thing takes up a bit of room but what it frees up in counter space/ peace of mind is well worth it!!</li>
      <li>I loved it so much bought another one for him to put his colognes and shsving items</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone who needs a storage  good job on arriving fast too.</li>
      <li>With this organizer, I can keep all my produce separate, keep an eye on which things might need to be used right away, and access them easily -- all in a tidy corner of the kitchen.</li>
      <li>Huge.</li>
      <li>After an exhaustive search, I finally found an organizer for makeup that is as sturdy as it is attractive.  </li>
      <li>This literaly fit all my make up</li>
      <li>and I liked it, very practical.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy with this purchase overall.</li>
      <li>The thing I like about this organizer is that it spins, which makes it really easy to quickly find what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
      <li>All the clutter from the bathroom is now organized, and the fact that it spins keeps everything accessible.  </li>
      <li>Makes my closet for products look organized and easily accessible.</li>
      <li>This organizer allowed me to declutter my counter, and also made it easier to clean the space that is now uncovered.  </li>
      <li>Clean countertop now.</li>
      <li>So if that tells you approx the height, second shelf is good for perfumes, deodorant.</li>
      <li>Everything I had read about this product is true.....</li>
      <li>very sturdy, and I love how it rotate too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and easy to use, and exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I love this on my vanity, it is pretttttttty expensive in price, but it shipped in perfect condition and rotates to perfection.</li>
      <li>This was EXACTLY what I was looking for!  </li>
      <li>Very chic!!</li>
      <li>It may be useful to some.</li>
      <li>Although I ended up returning this product it was only because my taller items wouldn&#x27;t fit on anything but the top shelf</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>was worth the money I put into it, holds so much perfume too!</li>
      <li>Looks higher end in person that it does in the photo.  </li>
      <li>But I am not willing to pay more than 30 dollars for a piece of plastic!</li>
      <li>Was exactly what I was looking for, but didn&#x27;t know it until I saw it online.  </li>
      <li>Even better - shortly after getting it, my boyfriend requested one (a &amp;#34;manlier&amp;#34; one) for his side of the counter, so now we&#x27;re bother organized.</li>
      <li>but saying that it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I originally saw it online, my heart dang near stopped!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I put one short object on top....</li>
      <li>It is what was needed to give more room with ease access to everything I used daily.</li>
      <li>Not to mention it is very overpriced!</li>
      <li>I wish the top part came off for larger products</li>
      <li>It makes a great holder for onions, garlic, lemons, and other such things that used to pile up in a basket (and often get bruised or rotten) on my kitchen counter.</li>
      <li>This is a very sturdy carousel, and fits my needs exactly.</li>
      <li>I needed something that could hold pretty much everything and keep things organized.</li>
      <li>Her dresser had so much clutter</li>
      <li>I do hope it lasts because it really doesn&#x27;t seem all that well made.  </li>
      <li>Over-priced but a real life saver.</li>
      <li>but it takes up just as much space as my hair products did without the organizer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter - it really helps organize all of her cosmetics &amp; the swivel keeps everything in sight.</li>
    <li> Was searching for something to help organize my hair and make up products that started taking over my husband side of the counter. Came across this and decided to give it a try my husband was happy no longer had to share his portion of his counter space. I loved it so much bought another one for him to put his colognes and shsving items etc. Now we way have way more space and stuff not spread all over the counter. Great buy.</li>
    <li> My elderly mother is disabled and this organizer has helped her greatly in getting her medicines and other bathroom items into an organized, useful area.  It is well made and comes assembled.  I would highly recommend this item even though it is more expensive than others like it.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased the item about 2 months ago and I liked it, very practical.  Everyone that went into my room wanted to know where I purchased it because they too wanted one.  Needless to see, after 2 months the item BROKE.  It didn&#x27;t fall, no blunt force was put on it, nothing out of the ordinary. I walked into my room and the plastic piece that keeps the items from falling off was split in 3 pieces.  Because this item was expensive I figured I can glue those pieces and save it from ending up in the dumpster. It worked! However, a week later the black platform broke off! This is bulls***! For $60 I would expect better quality. I loved the IDEA, but its poor execution.  I almost bought this for someone as a Christmas gift. I saved  myself another $60.</li>
    <li> I bought this cosmetic organizer because the clutter of all my beauty/hair products under my sink was getting out of control. I needed something that could hold pretty much everything and keep things organized. The thing I like about this organizer is that it spins, which makes it really easy to quickly find what I&#x27;m looking for. I was surprised just how much it could hold! The only stuff I couldn&#x27;t place in it were my tall bottles of hairspray and mousse, but I cleared up pretty much 95% of the clutter I had going on. Another good thing is that height-wise it fits perfectly in my cabinet. The thing I&#x27;m a little disappointed with are the clear holders. They seem a little too flimsy for me, even though in the product description it claims they&#x27;re unbreakable. Now that I have the actual product at home I think it&#x27;s a little too overpriced, but it did the job and I&#x27;m happy with this purchase overall.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! No more mess on my dresser!</li>
    <li> Over-priced but a real life saver. My counter top was beginning to look like a Sephora shop. Not only do I have cosmetics in the countertop, but in the drawer and in the linen closet and below sink storage which I detest. So I got this and put all the everyday stuff I use in it. Clean countertop now. Yay! Looks so much better and is so much more convenient. Actually the price wasn&#x27;t bad, but the shipping was over the top.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product and can really be used for men or women and even children. Really helps organize my stuff and gets my wife off my back! thank you!</li>
    <li> Love! Love!  Love this!  Where has it been all my life! Now I can finally &amp;#34;find and use&amp;#34; all my awesome anti-aging products!  Not to mention my master bath counter looks all nice and organized! Cuz If I can&#x27;t SEE IT...or FIND IT...I seem to not use it. And I pay waaaaaaaay to much good money for all my products. Keeping them in drawers is just NOT the same as SEEING them when you want to use them. Now all my Awesome Skin Care and Cosmetics are easy to find and apply!&lt;br /&gt;SO this is a Must Have for us women who KNOW... if they SEE their organized products...they will indeed USE THEM!&lt;br /&gt;:-D</li>
    <li> My cosmetics were all over my vanity area and I just did not have any room to function.  I love this organizer to the fullest.  It is what was needed to give more room with ease access to everything I used daily.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. Came already assembled. Huge. Big enough to hold all my perfumes, lotions, sprays, and vitamins! I&#x27;m elated 😁</li>
    <li> This is a nice piece to organize the many products I have. From perfumes to make up lotions medicines... My items for nicely and it a cute piece added a nice touch to my space. Very chic!! I posted a before and after picture! Despite other reviews the U it I received is very sturdy and hold a lot of items!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daugher who is 12 for Christmas.  Her dresser had so much clutter and this organizer was perfect.  She loved it and couldn&#x27;t wait to organize!!!!  This was delivered all put together, it spins as well and that is great too, and is amazing everything this organizer can hold.  This is extremely well made, not cheap looking at all and was definately worth the money paid for it.</li>
    <li> I love this on my vanity, it is pretttttttty expensive in price, but it shipped in perfect condition and rotates to perfection. Sometimes for convenience &amp;#34;hey just pay.&amp;#34; I just wish the bottom shelf were a little taller so I could put my equate cetaphil lotion in and have finger room to pump it. So if that tells you approx the height, second shelf is good for perfumes, deodorant. Top hairspray or candle. Bottom too short for spray.. Hope this helps? ;)</li>
    <li> but saying that it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. the product is way over priced but I couldn&#x27;t find anything that was big enough and had enough cubbys to fit all my stuff... too bad the company didn&#x27;t make this to last and too bad they&#x27;re iso greedy</li>
    <li> Very nice and pretty..</li>
    <li> I brought this to save space but it takes up just as much space as my hair products did without the organizer.  I guess if you like to spin your hair products this is good for you.</li>
    <li> way too big for my bathroom counter</li>
    <li> But I just got it in the mail and put all my/ my boyfriend&#x27;s products in this thing and there is actually still room to spare. It can hold a lot! I already know 7000% this is going to make my life easier. I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;ve never seen a toiletry/ cosmetic organizer like this before!!  Seems so common sense now that I have it!  This thing takes up a bit of room but what it frees up in counter space/ peace of mind is well worth it!!</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. I bought this for my perfumes which I have around 20 of different shapes and sizes. Not only did it fit all my perfumes but I was also able to put my lotions and deodorant on it with a little room to spare. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I feel it was pricey. If it was $15-$20 less, I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great organizer for the bathroom or crafts. Make more room on your counter and comes assembled. I use mine everyday, glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;When I originally saw it online, my heart dang near stopped! I had to have it!&lt;br /&gt; So perfect that I bought one for my sister too! If your a woman with a lot of products, you need this in your life!</li>
    <li> This was a horrible product. It fell apart as soon as I put it together. It&#x27;s made of plastic and not sturdy at all! Save your money. It is not worth $60. I wouldn&#x27;t even pay $10 for this product.</li>
    <li> This ended up being too big and cumbersome. It was eyesore. I threw it away. It may be useful to some.</li>
    <li> This was EXACTLY what I was looking for!  And I still have one of the big compartments and one of the small compartments open.</li>
    <li> I was going to put this on top of my dresser, but I decided to use it in the kitchen instead. It makes a great holder for onions, garlic, lemons, and other such things that used to pile up in a basket (and often get bruised or rotten) on my kitchen counter. With this organizer, I can keep all my produce separate, keep an eye on which things might need to be used right away, and access them easily -- all in a tidy corner of the kitchen.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love having all my products easily accessible and this organizes them so nicely! It fits in the corner of my sink counter in my smallish apartment bathroom perfectly ! A great product!</li>
    <li> i got this as a gift from my husband and i love it! i use it for all of my daily &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; it sppins evenly and does not have a flaw with it yet!</li>
    <li> Perfect for organizing our teenage daughter&#x27;s bathroom.  She doesn&#x27;t have a lot of counter space and her bathroom always looked messy before.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this organizer!</li>
    <li> At last.  After an exhaustive search, I finally found an organizer for makeup that is as sturdy as it is attractive.  *Sturdy.* Assembled.  Ready-to-use out of the box.  Looks great on the vanity and it holds a lot of product.  I reluctantly ordered this, not expecting much, after all, it is plastic...that spins.  But I am very pleased with the quality.  Looks higher end in person that it does in the photo.  I highly recommend this product. Not so in love with the price point but I&#x27;d order it again and give it as a gift to a busy woman who values time and prizes efficiency.</li>
    <li> This literaly fit all my make up and i finally have space on my vanity!! GREAT Quality as well.... I recommend this big time for make up collecters or organizing freaks like me heheheh enjoy</li>
    <li> Although I ended up returning this product it was only because my taller items wouldn&#x27;t fit on anything but the top shelf but I love PPM products &amp; they have good customer service</li>
    <li> Ok, so I understand that this might be a good product! But I am not willing to pay more than 30 dollars for a piece of plastic!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of my bathroom counter always looking so cluttered, and it also took more time to clean my counters off when I cleaned my bathroom.  This organizer allowed me to declutter my counter, and also made it easier to clean the space that is now uncovered.  It came already assembled. The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is some of the material that holds the items in, is a bit flimsy, but none of it has broken.  This is a win win buy, for those who like organization and easy cleaning.</li>
    <li> It is a lot bigger than what you think it is. I even measured the space out I was wanting this for and it just looked way too big.  I ended up placing this under my bathroom sink to hold all my extras and it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I just received my cosmetic organizer from Amazon, I just love it! was worth the money I put into it, holds so much perfume too! I had a few other bottles or remainders left, but, for the price I paid, I would order others too. very sturdy, and I love how it rotate too. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a storage  good job on arriving fast too.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was looking for, but didn&#x27;t know it until I saw it online.  Thought it was a bit expensive (I live on a pension), and have noticed that the price has dropped since I purchased it, but I still feel it was money well  spent as it has allowed me to declutter my bathroom vanity area.  The pictures provided by your web site are not misleading at all, in that you can cram an unbelievable amount of make-up products into this carousel, and clearly see and access them all.  This is a very sturdy carousel, and fits my needs exactly.</li>
    <li> All the clutter from the bathroom is now organized, and the fact that it spins keeps everything accessible.  The clear plastic walls are a little sharp on the edge - I cut my finger a tiny bit when I was setting it up, but haven&#x27;t had a problem since.  I&#x27;m not deducting a star for that, because my bathroom looks so much better!  Even better - shortly after getting it, my boyfriend requested one (a &amp;#34;manlier&amp;#34; one) for his side of the counter, so now we&#x27;re bother organized.</li>
    <li> Excellent when you want to be organized and everything at your fingertips. I added the wavy acrylic brush holder on top and gave it a great look and functional use..</li>
    <li> Everything I had read about this product is true.....it was fairly pricey for some pieces of plastic stuck together.  On the other hand, it was exactly what I wanted so I&#x27;m happy with it.  I do hope it lasts because it really doesn&#x27;t seem all that well made.  I had looked at other web sites and in stores and couldn&#x27;t find anything quite like this....which I thought was pretty basic.  The picture of the product shows items on very top.  I put one short object on top....anything else I&#x27;d worry would fall off.</li>
    <li> too tall, returned it.</li>
    <li> I would have liked to have an edge on the top tray.  It works perfect and it fits in the corner of my counter.</li>
    <li> It felt it was a bit expensive, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose well. Now all my perfumes are where I can see them and they don&#x27;t take up the whole counter space.  I&#x27;ve put only perfume bottles on it and they can be heavy, but the organizer spins very smoothly  even with all the bottles on in it. It seems pretty sturdy so far.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a month but I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It was an okay product, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for. Not to mention it is very overpriced! ($60?) . I returned this item.</li>
    <li> Makes my closet for products look organized and easily accessible. I wish the top part came off for larger products</li>
    <li> This product has made my life much easier.  It&#x27;s sturdy and easy to use, and exactly as advertised.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for something to organize their bathroom counter space.  The only slight downside is that many of my taller products are too tall even for the lower compartments.  I may have to start buying shorter products.</li>
    <li> A gift and recipient loved it.</li>
