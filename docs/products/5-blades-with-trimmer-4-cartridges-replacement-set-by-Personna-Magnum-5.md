      <li>I was thrilled that Amazon carries them.  </li>

      <li>These blade work great and give me a nice smooth shave.  </li>

      <li>They may not be as smooth as the M3 Power, but I find they still do a great job and the price savings is huge.    </li>
      <li>I consider these cartridge blades the best value of all the major brands I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I just shaved off two weeks of full beard with a used one of these and it is still good to go.  </li>
      <li>quick ship good price</li>

      <li>I am very happy with the quality and pricing of these blades compared to the big companies that charge substantially more for their products.  </li>
      <li>Now they are to flexible, and the blades seem more recessed in the cartridge</li>
      <li>I have no idea why the Wal Mart stores stopped selling them , it seems they do that with many affordable items.</li>
      <li>Would have been much more in the store.</li>
      <li>So glad to found them</li>
      <li>Love the trimmer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but not for me.</li>
      <li>Love them.  </li>
      <li>For some reason, M5 blades are not carried by most retailers, so I went on line.  </li>
      <li>The pricing was also so much better than the competition</li>
      <li>Buying them from you is cheaper and more convenient.</li>

      <li>Good quality, my husband uses this brand since his last deployment to  Iraq in 2009 and having the opportunity to buy the bulk is a good deal</li>
      <li>Not only was I able to enjoy the best shave, at a huge cost savings, but I was helping to turn around our nations unemployment problem with every razor that I purchased.</li>
      <li>If you want a clean shave of your face and if you shave your head then these are the way to go!</li>
      <li>/&gt;They certainly don&#x27;t give a shave that&#x27;s as close as a Gillette product, but they&#x27;re almost as good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used to love this razor.  So I ordered 36 cartridges, only to find out they changed the design.  Now they are to flexible, and the blades seem more recessed in the cartridge so they don&#x27;t get as close to my face and don&#x27;t get near as close as the shave I used to.  For the money, I&#x27;m going to dollar shave club (after I use my 36 cartridges).  Or the mach 3.  Those blades have thankfully gone down in price.</li>
    <li> I shave my head and face. The blades are very sharp so be careful though it gives a clean shave</li>
    <li> The Magnum blades were a great product and fantastic value when I started using them a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are not as good as a year ago in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Have been a huge fan of these razors for many years...but the last few boxes we received are faulty.  Use the razor maybe twice and the head breaks off.  I did reorder a few boxes in hopes it was just a bad batch.  So we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Changed them from the original.  Husband says they cut up his face and the original didn&#x27;t....got the originals at Costco and now they no longer carry them.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal user of these blades for a few years. I just received a new order of blades and it appears they have a new design. The old orange blades are now blue.  While the aloe strip is better on these new blades they don&#x27;t shave anywhere near as well as the old blades.  The best way I can describe it as that it seems as those only the center part of the blade is making contact with facial hair and not the entire blade. The trimmer on this new blade also is not very good.  I have only tried one blade so far. I&#x27;m going to sample others because I unfortunately bought a six pack of boxed blades. Doh!  If it is was just one bad blade and the other new blades really do work, I&#x27;ll amend my review.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking that these blades are the same exact quality, lets say for example, as the Gillette Fusion Proglide, because there not! The quality of these blades are excellent however, the small differences between the Gillette and the M5 Magnum  are not noticeable until you use them. Here&#x27;s the difference and it&#x27;s the difference between night and day. The 5 blade stripes that are contained in the Gillette product contain tiny &amp;#34;Separators&amp;#34;, 10 in all. There are two per blade one one the left side and one on the right side. What these critical separators do is keep the individual blade stripe separated from each other, Because this causes a space between each blade the facial hairs, shaving gel etc., rinse out easily keeping the blades clean for at least 5 uses. The Magnum, at first glance look exactly like the Gillette but DO NOT HAVE THE SEPARATORS. When I shaved with them it was almost impossible to rinse between the blades because they are touching. I tried using a toothpick, stiff paper, etc., in an effort to force the foreign material from between the blades but nothing worked.And there you have it. It took me quite awhile to figure this out using a magnifying glass to actually see the problem. I&#x27;m sure it costs less money to produce a blade cartridge without these tiny separators built into them. Not to build them into the Magnum Blade cartridge would account for the cheaper prices, (my opinion about the lower price) between the two products. I still have the M5 Blades, cannot even give them away. I chalked up the loss in cost to experience, I then purchased the Gillette product (The one that is used in the POWER razor, a great idea that works) and I am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> BEEN USING THESE FOR 5 YEARS. USED TO BUY AT SAFEWAY AND ALBERTSONS FOOD, BUT THEY DONT CARRY IT ANY MORE. GLAD TO SEE AMAZON HAS IT AT A GOOD PRICE. I MUST CONFESS I KEEP 48 BLADES IN STOCK. AFRAID I WONT FIND THEM LATER. LOVE WITH HOT LATHER MACHINE. USED MACH 3 AND FUSION FOR 20 YEARS. THESE ARE JUST AS SMOOTH AND WAY CHEAPER TO USE.  I BLADE LAST ME ALMOST A MONTH IF I DRY THE BLADES BEFORE STORING.  THESE ARE A MUST TRY AT A BUCK A BLADE, AND THEY HAVE A BUILT IN TRIMMER.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best in function and value you can find.The trimmer to me is peripheral but it does work.I have no idea why the Wal Mart stores stopped selling them , it seems they do that with many affordable items.All I know is I will never pay $3.00+ for a single blade refill as Gilette and Shick would have me do.</li>
    <li> This product is great and inexpensive if you buy at Costco for $18.99 for 20 cartridges + razor.That&#x27;s all folks</li>
    <li> I purchased these blades as part of the package that included the blades and the blade handle. Included in the package with the blade handle were some additional blades. The blades included in the blade handle package were horrible. Dull from the start and lots of nicks and cuts. I threw them out after about 3 shaves each. I was going to throw out the entire group but figured I&#x27;d use them up pretty quickly anyway so what the heck. Lo and behold the blades included in the replacement packs were vastly superior to the blades included with the handle. They give a smooth, comfortable shave and last as long as other, more expensive, Schick or Gillette blades. This is a good buy as long as you consider the caveat above.</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for years and they work great and last a long time.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00404XBM6 5 blades with trimmer, 4 cartridges, replacement set by Personna Magnum 5 - (6 pack)]]    Let me make a few things clear: these blades are superb. The Personna M5 razor is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 25 years. And the seller, Freedom Hill LLC, is exceptionally good. Each time I&#x27;ve ordered from them, the blades have come solidly packaged and arrived on time, if not early.    So, why won&#x27;t I buy them again?     One word: price.    The price has gone up 50% since my last order in March. From about $37.00 to almost $55.00. As good as they are, they aren&#x27;t that good. I can get \\&quot;almost as good\\&quot; blades in stores for considerably less than that. Great product and great service can make up a lot for price, but not that much for me.    I&#x27;ll keep checking to see if these come back down to a more reasonable price, but in the meantime, I&#x27;ll be trying some of the competition.</li>
    <li> This is a very good deal because i was looking for those catriges all over and i did not fóund it</li>
    <li> Best Blades on the market IMO</li>
    <li> I love these blades!  They&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve found, and they aren&#x27;t insanely expensive.  I&#x27;ve been buying them in Walmart, but unfortunately they discontinued them.  They cost about $3/more per package here, but at least I can still get them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tired of paying 50 dollars for the Gillette razors/refills &amp; thought I&#x27;d try these since they were practically 1/2 price of Gillette&#x27;s. What a mistake &amp; waste of money this brand is... I&#x27;ve used Gillette cartridges for 6 months that were light years sharper than these. This brand seems to leave a ragged 1/32 inch stubble all over your face at the best. Terrible, terrible, terrible!</li>
    <li> I first bought these at a Dollar General store on clearance for half off so I thought, why not..  I tried them and loved them. I agree with the other reviewers, this razor does last quite a while and the quality is just as good as the more expensive ones. I actually prefer these, as opposed to the Fusion with the ball thing I just bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for them for about a year now and couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere, until today. I found them at a small post exchange on a military base in Virginia. Wasn&#x27;t exactly sure it was the same until it snapped right into my old handle. Looking forward to shaving with it tomorrow!</li>
    <li> Brought first set and blades from W@lm@rt and they stopped carrying them. I thought my blades were over. In comes Amazon. This is my second re-order and love them. Always on or before guaranty day.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Great price!  Thought because it was cheap that it would be no good, but turns out I like it even better than the expensive Gillette 5 blade.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality and pricing of these blades compared to the big companies that charge substantially more for their products.  I used to be able to pick these up my local Stop and Shop Supermarket, however, they do not have them as a readily available as they used to.  They usually only have one or two replacement blades available and do not get much in terms of replenishments.  I decided to check Amazon and was happy to find they had the blades for sale.</li>
    <li> Amazon pricing makes it worth while. While not the best razor it comes pretty close. Works well made in the USA.</li>
    <li> 5 Blades.  Works with a recently discontinued model used to be sold through Costco. Amazon had this in inventory and I was happy it was available.</li>
    <li> good close shave and leaves the skin smooth at least for a day. My beard grows fast so to stay smooth I need to shave every day but for others it might even stay smooth for more than a day.</li>
    <li> They are good razor blades. They stay sharp if you take care of them. I rub mine backward on my skin or on some cloth to sharpen them. I also make sure they&#x27;re dry between uses. I should soak in alcohol too, but I&#x27;ve been too lazy to do that.</li>
    <li> Great blades, great shave and a better price or service you will not find.</li>
    <li> Super blade.&lt;br /&gt;Had been using Gillette blades for years.&lt;br /&gt;They are overpriced junk.&lt;br /&gt;Dull down in no time.&lt;br /&gt;Out of frustration I tried the M5 and to my amazement, they are sharp&lt;br /&gt;and last for many month&#x27;s. The five blade setup makes the razor glide&lt;br /&gt;over your face like it is not there but shaves close, without cuts, and is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I gave up shaving cream and just use a soap bar over the beard, lather a bit with light warm water.&lt;br /&gt;The M5 does the rest and what a pleasure compared to the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice product indeed, will never change now.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette was overpriced hamburger, this is Porter House Steak.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will love it. Beautiful balance to the handle as well, and not&lt;br /&gt;cheaply made either, a star shaving system worthy of recognition without tricks.</li>
    <li> arrived A0K and on time Very satisfied</li>
    <li> While visiting my in-laws over Christmas time I forgot to pack my Gillette M3 Power razor. I ran to a local grocery store, but was disgusted at the price they wanted for the razor. Instead of giving in and buying it, they had the M5 Magnum razor on sale with two blades for $4.99, so I figured I would give it a try.    I have been using these M5 Razors for just about 5 months and I would have no problems recommending them! They may not be as smooth as the M3 Power, but I find they still do a great job and the price savings is huge.    Recommended!</li>
    <li> I discovered the M5 blades by mistake, last year. I picked up a pack, thinking they were generic replacements for the Fusion. When I got  home I realized they didn&#x27;t fit my fusion razor. So, I decided to try the razor and bought one. I was surprised by  the quality of the shave. It was actually better than the Fusion and the blades were significantly cheaper. Unfortunately, the store where I bought the blades has discontinued them and I have been unable to find them at other stores in my area. So, I was very pleased to find them on Amazon at an even lower price. I was concerned by the one review that said the blades had been changed, now came in blue instead of orange and didn&#x27;t shave as well. So, again I was pleased to find my old &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; blades when I opened the package. The blades are exactly as they have always been with the same superior shaving experience.</li>
    <li> These razors perform as well as the leading competitor&#x27;s 5 blade (gillette) at a fraction of the price. (note: They fit the M5 Magnum handle, not Gillette&#x27;s)</li>
    <li> For the past year and a half I have used M5 blades, but when looking for more found that they were no longer available locally.  The M5s are very good blades and far, far less expensive than the major brands.  They provide very good shaves, although probably not quite as close as those from the more expensive blades.  I shall continue to use M5s as long as they are available.</li>
    <li> I bought an M5 razor while in a federal prison in California.  I&#x27;m now in Seattle and none of the stores here carry the M5.  It&#x27;s a great razor.  Especially if you have a goatee.  I received the blades I ordered in three days; exactly when the seller said I would receive it.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy from him again.</li>
    <li> These blades have saved me so much money.  I get about 3 months worth of daily shaves with 1 of these blades, and they are close and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought an M5 Magnum razor some time ago only to learn that every brand requires its own replacement blades!  For some reason, M5 blades are not carried by most retailers, so I went on line.  They work!  They fit my razor and they provide close, comfortable shaves for several usages.  The online price is comparable to the retail store price of other brands and I like the heft and feel of the Magnum handle.</li>
    <li> My husbands fav blade for his bald head!</li>
    <li> For the cost, these are easily the best razors one can buy.  The M5 does about 95% as good a job as the 5 bladed Gillette, while being about a third the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sick of shelling out large sums of money for razors, these are for you.</li>
    <li> I got hooked on these Razors a few years ago, I use them to shave my face/head and always achieve a smooth face/head.  The problem was the local stores in my area stopped carrying these so I turned to on-line shopping.  So glad to found them and they cost less than what I was paying in my area!  If you want a clean shave of your face and if you shave your head then these are the way to go!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Arrived promptly and packed well.</li>
    <li> Quality, quality are not equal to brand name</li>
    <li> Hard to find razors. I got used to these when I was in the military and I just can&#x27;t find them local any more.</li>
    <li> I started using the M5 Magnum blades about 6 months ago after my (adult) son gave me a box to try.  The Gillette Fusion blades I was using worked well but were fairly expensive especially if you shave every day like I do.  These blades are very similar to the Gillette version and are nearly as good when it comes to a comfortable shave.  However; the price for the M5 Magnum blades is less than half the cost of the Gillette blades.  On a 1 to 10 scale I would rate Gillette as a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; and the M5 Magnum as a &amp;#34;9&amp;#34;.  Both brands last me about a week per blade.  As long as they keep making the M5 Magnum blades, I won&#x27;t be buying the Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
    <li> I am highly satisfied with the product!</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago I bought this brand at Costco and they were excellent.  They literally last for many shaves and I do have a thick beard.  I believe they are better than the other expensive brands that have a monopoly on the market.  Glad I was able to find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Tired of a thousand choices for razor blades, all over priced. If you are, this razor is for you. It shaves well, is comfortable to use, very affordable and the blades last a long time. It is like a  high end comfort razor from an over advertised product producer at the cost of a &amp;#34;buck-a-day&amp;#34; shave. A great buy!</li>
    <li> Fantastic razors-just as good as the name brands just less expensive!</li>
    <li> Best razor ive ever used, all other give me a hell of a razor rash but this razer &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34; the competition (pun intended)</li>
    <li> Great merchandise. Razor bkades better than Gillete.</li>
    <li> I am over fifty years of age and I shave every day. I have tried just about every razor on the market seeking the closest, smoothest shave possible! I did not mind the cost of the razors. The last brand that I was using was Gillette. Recently I read a Men&#x27;s Magazine review of the best razor and was surprized to read that it was not Gillette. I knew I had to try it. I did and WOW!!! The shave experience was the BEST of my LIFE! No knicks or cuts. I was floored also by the much lower cost compared to what I was used to paying. Finally, I found out that the razors were manufactured right here in the Good Ole United States of America! This sealed the deal for me. Not only was I able to enjoy the best shave, at a huge cost savings, but I was helping to turn around our nations unemployment problem with every razor that I purchased. I took a moment then to think about what if evey man who shaves in the USA switched to this great razor for one year and see the difference for themselves. Would we end unemployment in our country? Just a Thought!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I consider these cartridge blades the best value of all the major brands I&#x27;ve used.  They give me a close shave and they stay sharp much longer than the other name brands and they are the best value on the market compared to the major brands, about a third of the cost.</li>
    <li> I ordered M5 Magnum razor blades as advertised and shown on Amazon website. The M5 Magnum blades have a red plastic frame on the lower edge the blades as shown in the picture on the website. The blades I received fit my razor but have a blue frame frame on the lower edge the blades and is of a lighter weight construction than my original M5 Magnum blades. The box the cartridge come in has 5 Magnum printed on it, but does not say M5 Magnum. The shave with these blades is much inferior to the original M5 blades which I thought I ordered. Unfortunately, I did not have occasion to use the new blades until months after I received them and did not discover the error until after the return period. These blades were sold and shipped by iSpotBeauty. I would think that Amazon would verify that their suppliers would accurately describe and ship the correct products offered for sale on their site. I am a long time Amazon Premier member and have been highly satisfied with my purchases at Amazon over the years. It, however, upsets me that suppliers may be substituting inferior products for what is advertised on the Amazon website. I have 24 razor cartridges which were not what was advertised. Normally, I would chalk it up to experience and live with it, except I have 24 razor cartridges which will give me an inferior shave for over a year.  No thanks. I will order from another website where I count on getting what I want.</li>
    <li> A couple of years back I found this item at a store and I was very impressed by the smooth, close shave. The pricing was also so much better than the competition so I was saddened when stores stopped carrying this item. I tried something else but very disappointing shaving so I searched for these online. I&#x27;m happy i found this product online. Fast shipping and great to have these blades back in my life.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but you have to buy a 6 pack of six razors when you purchase this product. Since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else, I am left with this option. Decent razors, but its a Costco size package!</li>
    <li> Fast and as described - not much left out there for this quality at this price - very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Good price for buying in bulk. Cheaper than buying an 8 pack at CVS. My husband is very practical lol</li>
    <li> Good price for a great product . I love the M5 blades shave my tough beard with no problem just wish I could buy less and still get free shipping.</li>
    <li> The razors are fine. My only gripe was that in the advertisement you are led to believe that you are getting 30 replacement cartridges. It says 6 pack (total of 30 blades). Well, there are 5 blades per cartridge. Not 5 cartridges per pack. I got 6 packs but of 24. Its a weird labeling mistake, and I thought I was getting 30 (cause of the listing of \\&quot;total of 30 blades\\&quot;). If it was the blade advertisement, there would be 5 blades per cartridge, 4 cartridge per pack and 6 packs sent. So 5x4x6&#x3D;120 blades. See my misguidance???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors themselves are good. So, no complaints about those.</li>
    <li> Works!  Soooo much cheaper than Gillette or Schick.</li>
    <li> Use these shavers for years and they are inexpensive and effective.  Gets the job done in a 1/4 of the price!</li>
    <li> I use them for years, it helps to dry them after use (blow out the water) and they last longer</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.  Love the razor.  Blades no longer sold at Walmart.  Glad I was to able to find them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these blades for years and like them very much.  I used to be able to buy them locally but not anymore.  Buying them from you is cheaper and more convenient.</li>
    <li> Quality is the same as that of Gillette fusion, price is much more reasonable. I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love them.  Couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere until now and the price is great.  Would have been much more in the store.</li>
    <li> Listen, just compare the price of these razors to a similar Gillette product. They are so much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re like me and can only use a razor once, due to skin irritation, then these are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They certainly don&#x27;t give a shave that&#x27;s as close as a Gillette product, but they&#x27;re almost as good. So why spend the extra money?</li>
    <li> My only regret is I didnt find them sooner.  I shave my face every day and my head every other day and I am getting 2 weeks out of a blade comfortably.  I could probably get more but why bother at this price.</li>
    <li> A good affordable razor blade system, a much better deal than the big national brands.  The only downside is the number of uses I can get with a blade.</li>
    <li> Good not be happier with my purchase...local stores no longer carry these blades.  Great shipping time.</li>
    <li> Shortly after purchasing a Magnum M5 Razor we went back looking for more blades and neither item was on the shelf any longer.  The razor worked well so finding more blades was important.  We were delighted to find them on Amazon and have since ordered several times.  The blades work great and shipping was even faster than Amazon anticipated.  Will continue to order them as long as they are available.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for the price. They shave very close and are very inexpensive !!  I totally recommend this product to every one !!!</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used. They work great and last a long, long time. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I bought my original razor at Rite Aid.  They stopped carrying the blades.  I was thrilled that Amazon carries them.  These blade work great and give me a nice smooth shave.  I have sensitive skin and they don&#x27;t bother it.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors my husband and I have ever used and for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought the original razor on a whim and have loved it.  The razor blades come in a holder that neatly tucks into the original container for the handle.  The blades do not clog easily and the trimmer is very handy for dealing with hairs under your nose, for instance.  These blades almost never nick me and they last longer than most.  I really like this product and should be worth your time to try them.</li>
    <li> I had been buying the previous version of the razor, which was just about 6 months ago. In that version the blades were gray and not orange. The new orange ones seem to not cut as well, get clogged up easier with shaving cream, and I seem to get more nicks. Not happy with it and greatly prefer the old ones, which I would have rated as 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought the razor at Rite Aid and it has given me the best shave without any nicks.  Unfortunately Rite Aid is no longer stocking the blades as they introduced a newer model that I found was not as good.  These blades are the best!</li>
    <li> They are just like any other razor only a quarter of the price. I&#x27;ll never buy other razor blades as long as these are out.</li>
    <li> Excellent Razor for the price.  This is my go to razor.  Used to get it Costco, but they stopped carrying.  So happy to find it on Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;* 5 blade system shaves as close as any razor&lt;br /&gt;* Inexpensive relative to the competition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;* Razor doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as competition- i probably get 1 less shave per razor</li>
    <li> The prices are much better than the Fusion and you get the same or better shave. The blades seem to last longer as well. Highly recommended over Fusion if you do your due diligence on the net for the best prices.</li>
    <li> Better than Gillette, at a fraction of the price. American made, by a company with a long history of making shaving blades. Love it.</li>
    <li> These are good quality blades, much cheaper than the big names in the razor blade business.  I bought a pack of these at Amazon.  There are 24 cartridges in the package, six trays each with four cartridges.  They have a wear strip that can be used to keep track of how worn they are becoming and can be used will into the time when the color is seriously faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you have to have the cartridge holder for this brand, which I got at Costco with my first pack of cartridges.</li>
    <li> Previously , I have purchased these blades in bulk from Costco and they were great. However, they were not orange in color above and below the blades, they were blue. These new blades with the orange strips are more abrasive and do not last near as many shaves as the old ones. I will not order any more of the new orange ones.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades for my husband.  They met my hysband&#x27;s need for a smooth shave and are a fine value.  Oher blades cost substantially more.but do not perform any better.</li>
    <li> This was an unfortunate gift from a friend who didn&#x27;t like them either, once the blades are used up it is adios for M5 Magnum. I cut my self nearly every time I use this razor, I have to be careful not to nick the base of my nose with the giant set of blades, if I had a giant flat face say quarter of an acre or more this would be great, looking for a chimp or gorilla that would like a free razor.</li>
    <li> saves more money than other similar blades&lt;br /&gt;Lasts longer than expected&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Have puchased this before and will do again</li>
    <li> Good quality, my husband uses this brand since his last deployment to  Iraq in 2009 and having the opportunity to buy the bulk is a good deal</li>
    <li> I have a full beard.  Love the trimmer.  Started using M5 several years ago.  Couldn&#x27;t find replacement blades locally.&lt;br /&gt;So finding them on amazon was great. They are the most comfortable blades.</li>
    <li> quick ship good price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not for me. It does a good job shaving but I&#x27;m not a fan of 5 blades because it irritates my face. It doesn&#x27;t get the hair under my nose cleanly. I have had to use another shaver to do that.</li>
    <li> best shave head and face  i&#x27;ve had in many years and certainly at a more affordable price. will be back for more</li>
    <li> The first time I used these I had to keep checking to see if they were working, they give the smoothest shave I have ever had.  The biggest difference between these and every other blade out there is that they don&#x27;t plug with hair.  Finally, they stay sharp for an extremely long time.  I just shaved off two weeks of full beard with a used one of these and it is still good to go.  Excellent razor.</li>
