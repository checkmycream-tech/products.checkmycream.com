      <li>Best shaver I have ever used.</li>
      <li>They are the best I have tried and do the job well.</li>
      <li>The best disposable razor out there</li>
      <li>I purchased these razors because they seemed like a great deal.  </li>
      <li>Stumbled across these years ago great disposable razor.</li>
      <li>I bought two packages of these because they were a great deal.  </li>
      <li>(to put it very nicely) to my skin.  </li>
      <li>and even then it still wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
      <li>but i gues they should stick to what they are good at ie</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked online, and find that the GILLETTE VENUS EMBRACE is the best-rated razor, by Good Housekeeping and others.</li>
      <li>Great smooth shave.</li>
      <li>But these are deserving.</li>
      <li>Thanks to this awesome product, I have to wear pants on the 4th of July.  </li>
      <li>but I feel very strongly about this one.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t offer a very smooth shave.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite razor.</li>
      <li>I love that they are so inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I had to re examine the package and make sure I hadnt picked up Noxzema Butter knives.</li>
      <li>I love these razors.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these razors because they were on sale and came in cute colors</li>
      <li>how ever many times you run it over.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these razors.</li>
      <li>Works for more than just one shave.</li>
      <li>Sometimes they have them at the store but most of the time they are out.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased.</li>
      <li>Fast easy &amp;  great price</li>
      <li>Even the cheap bic razors are 100x better than these.</li>
      <li>I do think there should be a  minus rating available, as I would rate these razors as -10 at best.    </li>
      <li>Easy suicide method!\\&quot;    </li>
      <li>I get a smooth shave every time.</li>
      <li>Ended up getting these for free plus sales tax after using Mfg coupon.     </li>
      <li>Even then you don&#x27;t get a clean, smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They tore up my under arms and did not leave me with a clean shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;m through the pack now and will go back to my old brand!!!</li>
      <li>Overall, I have been very pleased with these and will purchase again.</li>
      <li>I tried shaving my underarms and legs, and although I shaved over each area multiple times, most of what I was trying to remove was not removed!</li>
      <li>I rarely review products</li>
      <li>Having a hamburger is a fun way to spend the holiday.  </li>
      <li>I opened them and tried one for the first time yesterday.  </li>
      <li>you better believe they&#x27;re going back to the store!</li>
      <li>many showers later and still no screams from the shower!</li>
      <li>and since I am not brand loyal to any particular disposable razor, figured what the hell.  </li>
      <li>this razor for the first time this morning.</li>
      <li>so I quickly disposed of it and went for a new razor.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how they can sell these in good conscience.</li>
      <li>The first shave wasn&#x27;t good - about the equivalent of the second or third day with a decent razor.</li>
      <li>My skin is super sensitive and already itches all the time anyway.</li>
      <li>I paid $3.00 for a 6 pack (4 + 2 bonus) and they&#x27;re made by Noxzema, so I thought they would be pretty decent.  </li>
      <li>I am writing the company for some real complaining.</li>
      <li>I suspect I&#x27;d get better results with those pink Daisy razors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased cheap-o disposable razors that will nick my skin or even sting my skin, but never have I ever used  razors that don&#x27;t even really shave.  </li>
      <li>I got a much closer shave than I ever got with Venus.</li>
      <li>I paid too much.    </li>
      <li>I am a careful shaver and have 10 years experience under my belt, but these with these razors I nicked myself ever time I shaved (mostly around ankles and knees).     </li>
      <li>Also, the head of the razor does not turn very well to follow the skin.  </li>
      <li>The quality was what I would have expected from a no-name brand bought at the Dollar Store, not from a reputable company like Noxzema.</li>
      <li>Looking like hamburger really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>with one fresh out of the package, it barely took any hair off my legs and underarms, and when used in conjunction with bikini zone (great product for down there hair), I was swiping over the same area 4-5 times...</li>
      <li>Do not waste any money on these razors!!!</li>
      <li>I use them with Pure Silk shaving cream and find that they leave me with a smooth, close shave (and I always moisturize after I shave, so dry skin is a non-issue).</li>
      <li>Despite the wide handle, the razors slipped from my hand easily.  </li>
      <li>They are way better than the more expensive razors.</li>
      <li>a dull carrot scarper might be more applicable  AMAZON SHOULD REMOVE THIS PRODUCT FROM THEIR SITE IMMEDIATELY!</li>
      <li>At free plus sales tax on $3.99 which is approx $0.32 cents for 4 or 3 (I tried both the pink 3 blade and the purple 4 blade)</li>
      <li>And of course they come in such fun</li>
      <li>I would buy the most generic single blade 10 pack of disposables before I would ever consider buying these.  </li>
      <li>But the bottom line is that, overall, I think these razors do a perfectly fine job, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>On the first use, they were decent, but throughout shaving, I had to constantly tap the razor head on the side of the shower to remove the hair that was stuck in there.  </li>
      <li>Brand new one did not shave any hair even after going over it 3-4 times...</li>
      <li>I have used this razor for several months now, and it is the only razor I have ever used that I can skip a day of shaving and my legs remain smooth.</li>
      <li>Guess I&#x27;ll have to go back to my more expensive razor refills which I love; I was just hoping to save some money.</li>
      <li>My dull razors works better than these.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive legs and do not break out using these.</li>
      <li>They do not take the hair completely off.</li>
      <li>You will have to shave over the same spot about 10-15 times to really get the hair shaved.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually make comments about products but in this case it has to be told - I would have been better of scraping my hair off with a cheese grater.....not just for hair removal but overall discomfort</li>
      <li>They shave very close and work just as well as the more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but so far this is the only place I found to write a review...only in hopes of helping others avoid some pain and costs.</li>
      <li>My husband bought these razors for me, but I will be buying my old brand in the future.</li>
      <li>My one complaint of these is that I find my hair starts to grow back relatively quickly, at least compared to razors with five or six blades (for a while Noxema made six-blade women&#x27;s razors, which I LOVED, but I have not been able to find them anywhere lately).</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re dull right away!</li>
      <li>After six or seven uses they do start to get dull and begin knicking me around the knees and ankles, but I&#x27;ve found that to be true of *all* razors, whether you pay $3 or $30 for them.</li>
      <li>These razors go dull quick, definitely sacraficing quality with the lower price, barely got one use before I needed another</li>
      <li>The head is pointed down too much.</li>
      <li>I mean, full strands were still left after taking this razor across my skin four or five times.</li>
      <li>Good riddance to a bad product.</li>

<li> The packaging looks a little different and the razors have purple handles.  </li>
<li> so I am not exactly a novice.  </li>
<li> I had a couple problems with cuts, not like the other reviews.  </li>
<li> Even then, there was still quite a bit of hair stuck in there as well as shaving cream, so any subsequent use of the razor would be pointless.  </li>
<li> I will not buy any other brand.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My 22-year-old granddaughter cuts herself pretty badly EVERY time she shaves.  She used these razors and not 1 nick!!!!  We are sold!!!!  update... many showers later and still no screams from the shower!</li>
    <li> I bought two packages of these because they were a great deal.  I opened them and tried one for the first time yesterday.  I have been shaving my legs for 25 years so I am not exactly a novice.  I shaved my legs like I always do and didn&#x27;t notice any problems.  Then as I started to rinse my legs, they started bleeding.  All over.  My legs bled on and off for the next 3 hours.  My shins have deep little cuts, not shaving nicks all up them.   I have never had a worse shaving experience.  My legs hurt and look awful.  Thanks to this awesome product, I have to wear pants on the 4th of July.  Having a hamburger is a fun way to spend the holiday.  Looking like hamburger really isn&#x27;t.  I cannot believe this product is being sold.</li>
    <li> I get these at my local store.  The packaging looks a little different and the razors have purple handles.  I love these razors.  They shave very close and work just as well as the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Ended up getting these for free plus sales tax after using Mfg coupon.     Their motto should be:  \\&quot;For those who hate life!  Easy suicide method!\\&quot;    At free plus sales tax on $3.99 which is approx $0.32 cents for 4 or 3 (I tried both the pink 3 blade and the purple 4 blade) I paid too much.    I am writing the company for some real complaining.</li>
    <li> I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I was mystified to see all the bad reviews. I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors for years now, and I was sick of paying high prices for them. I saw these in the store for considerably less and figured I have nothing to lose. My skin is super sensitive and already itches all the time anyway. I figured that these razors couldn&#x27;t possibly make things any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used this razor for the first time this morning. I got a much closer shave than I ever got with Venus. And my legs haven&#x27;t itched for the entire day!! I am so pleased. I am making the switch to Noxzema razors.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, 1 star is the lowest rating that can be given. I do think there should be a  minus rating available, as I would rate these razors as -10 at best.    My story: I bought a 4-pack of four-bladed Noxema razors. They DO NOT WORK, and I&#x27;ve NEVER had such lousy razors. I tried shaving my underarms and legs, and although I shaved over each area multiple times, most of what I was trying to remove was not removed! Then I tried holding the razor at different angles, thinking that I&#x27;d find one angle that would work. No such luck! My skin was very irritated; it was painful to try to use deodorant after my skin had been rubbed raw. I will never buy these again, nor will I suggest them to anyone!!!     I&#x27;ve looked online, and find that the GILLETTE VENUS EMBRACE is the best-rated razor, by Good Housekeeping and others. That is what I will buy tomorrow after I throw the remaining 3 Noxema razors in the trash! I hate to trash brand new items, but surely would not give them to anyone. Good riddance to a bad product.</li>
    <li> I bought a 4pk on sale; the packaging and brand suggested a satisfactory product... wrong: worst razor, ever. with one fresh out of the package, it barely took any hair off my legs and underarms, and when used in conjunction with bikini zone (great product for down there hair), I was swiping over the same area 4-5 times... then I decided, screw this, got OUT of the shower, threw away this crappy product, and opted for one of my husband&#x27;s cheap-o disposable bic razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this razor does not work. don&#x27;t let the package and brand name fool you.</li>
    <li> These razors go dull quick, definitely sacraficing quality with the lower price, barely got one use before I needed another</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy these razors from Amazon but people need to be warned. They don&#x27;t even cut the hair! I couldn&#x27;t cut a hair on my chin let alone my legs. I bought these to save a little money but I&#x27;ll never do that again. They are so dull and worthless. Noxema needs to stick with creams. I would give these zero stars if I could they are that bad.</li>
    <li> I am a little surprised to see so many bad reviews of this product. Are these the best razors in the world?  No, but they get the job done, at least for me. I use them with Pure Silk shaving cream and find that they leave me with a smooth, close shave (and I always moisturize after I shave, so dry skin is a non-issue). After six or seven uses they do start to get dull and begin knicking me around the knees and ankles, but I&#x27;ve found that to be true of *all* razors, whether you pay $3 or $30 for them. My one complaint of these is that I find my hair starts to grow back relatively quickly, at least compared to razors with five or six blades (for a while Noxema made six-blade women&#x27;s razors, which I LOVED, but I have not been able to find them anywhere lately). But the bottom line is that, overall, I think these razors do a perfectly fine job, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> boooooo.  noxema should stick with cold creme.  What a disappointment.  I didn&#x27;t choose to buy these razors.  It wasn&#x27;t until I was home unpacking bags that I realized I was charged for them.  I had a $300 grocery load and don&#x27;t even remember what I paid for them.  Rather than be hassled by returning them, I thought, I&#x27;ll just use them.  What a mistake.  I don&#x27;t have time for them.  It would take several swipes, and still leave hairs.  I had a couple problems with cuts, not like the other reviews.  I would buy the most generic single blade 10 pack of disposables before I would ever consider buying these.  And if it happens again (that they make it into my bag with out me knowing) you better believe they&#x27;re going back to the store!</li>
    <li> I tried these razors as an alternative to another brand of disposable razors I had been using as they were a bit less expensive. I guess you get what you pay for.     I am a careful shaver and have 10 years experience under my belt, but these with these razors I nicked myself ever time I shaved (mostly around ankles and knees).     Also, the shave was never close! I would get out of the shower and feel a slight hint of stubble resulting from a poor shave. I only ever used one razor for a max of two times before I had to replace it (I usually like to use them more than that and usually can!!) and even then it still wasn&#x27;t good. I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;m through the pack now and will go back to my old brand!!!</li>
    <li> These things are horrible. I&#x27;ve never had a razor NOT take the hair off. I mean, full strands were still left after taking this razor across my skin four or five times. I was rewarded, oddly enough, with razor burn the next day as well. Don&#x27;t even risk it.</li>
    <li> WORST RAZORS EVER! They simply DO NOT WORK! How that&#x27;s possible? I have no clue. But I&#x27;m telling you- they do. not. work! I would say that it un-evenly trims your hair so you&#x27;re at borderline rip your skin off itchy stubble level and simply will not shave to skin how ever many times you run it over. Waste of money. Will never buy again!</li>
    <li> WORST RAZORS EVER!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these razors because they seemed like a great deal.  I paid $3.00 for a 6 pack (4 + 2 bonus) and they&#x27;re made by Noxzema, so I thought they would be pretty decent.  I thought wrong!  I had to go over a patch of skin several times for the razor to even remove any hair.  When it did finally get a some of the hair the razor would just become clogged.  I was constantly having to stop to rinse it under a sharp stream of water.  Worst of all, in spite of using shaving cream, after I finished I was left with nasty razor burn up and down my legs and underarms.  Noxzema definitely needs to rethink this product.  I&#x27;m not sure how they can sell these in good conscience.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these razors. They are the best I have tried and do the job well. I love that they are so inexpensive. I get a smooth shave every time. They are way better than the more expensive razors.</li>
    <li> My dull razors works better than these.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a razor to pet your leg hair with - these work like a champ. If you&#x27;re impatient and hate waiting for your razor blades to lose their sharpness - these are perfect! They&#x27;re dull enough to leave you with bloody nicks with your leg hair length untouched right out of the box! No waiting! They&#x27;re dull right away! And of course they come in such fun feminine colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I don&#x27;t write a 1-star review, well, ever. But these are deserving. I really didn&#x27;t think a razor could be this useless.</li>
    <li> Stumbled across these years ago great disposable razor. Would recommend to anyone. Especially for camping. Works for more than just one shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased a four pack of these razors because I prefer a razor with a wider handle and multiple blades.  Despite the wide handle, the razors slipped from my hand easily.  The multiple blades also didn&#x27;t help- they did not shave the hair that closely, but close enough to cut the skin and give razor burn.  On the first use, they were decent, but throughout shaving, I had to constantly tap the razor head on the side of the shower to remove the hair that was stuck in there.  Even then, there was still quite a bit of hair stuck in there as well as shaving cream, so any subsequent use of the razor would be pointless.  Also, the head of the razor does not turn very well to follow the skin.  Save your money and buy a different brand.</li>
    <li> While these razors have given me a decent shave, I am disappointed in the flimsiness of the design. My husband bought these razors for me, but I will be buying my old brand in the future. I always place my razor on a ledge in my shower. Sometimes they get knocked off, but, I&#x27;ve never had a razor break like these! If one of the four little teeth that hold the razor head to the handle breaks, you cannot re-attach the razor to the handle. I&#x27;ve had to throw away three of the four razors in this pack before they became dull because they broke.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but so far this is the only place I found to write a review...only in hopes of helping others avoid some pain and costs. I don&#x27;t usually make comments about products but in this case it has to be told - I would have been better of scraping my hair off with a cheese grater.....not just for hair removal but overall discomfort (to put it very nicely) to my skin.  Absolutely unbelievable that Noxzema can get away with marketing this as a razor....a dull carrot scarper might be more applicable  AMAZON SHOULD REMOVE THIS PRODUCT FROM THEIR SITE IMMEDIATELY!</li>
    <li> The only razors I have used for 10 plus years. I will not buy any other brand.</li>
    <li> Worst razors Ive ever used in my life! Brand new one did not shave any hair even after going over it 3-4 times...</li>
    <li> I rarely review products but I feel very strongly about this one.  Whatever the chemical in the moisturizing blade was gave me a horrible rash where I shaved that I had to get a cortisone shot to heal after a week!!!</li>
    <li> I had to re examine the package and make sure I hadnt picked up Noxzema Butter knives. What a waste of plastic.</li>
    <li> The best disposable razor out there</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for several months now, and it is the only razor I have ever used that I can skip a day of shaving and my legs remain smooth. I have not experienced the nicks and cuts that others have described. Overall, I have been very pleased with these and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I Made a terrible mistake with these. The head is pointed down too much. You would think that with 4 blades, you&#x27;d get a close shave, but I ran the razor over this patch of hair on my legs, and it did nothing. I tried and tried, the hair was still there, just shorter. Also, these shavers are more dangerous than any other shavers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t offer a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased these razors because they were on sale and came in cute colors and since I am not brand loyal to any particular disposable razor, figured what the hell.  I&#x27;ve purchased cheap-o disposable razors that will nick my skin or even sting my skin, but never have I ever used  razors that don&#x27;t even really shave.  Don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;4 blade\\&quot; name fool you.  You will have to shave over the same spot about 10-15 times to really get the hair shaved. Even then you don&#x27;t get a clean, smooth shave.  I thought that perhaps it was only the one razor in the pack so I quickly disposed of it and went for a new razor.  I had the same problem with all the razors in the pack.  It makes me wonder if Noxzema does any QA in its manufacturing.  Do not waste any money on these razors!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite razor. It is also hard to find. Sometimes they have them at the store but most of the time they are out. I have sensitive legs and do not break out using these. My husband also loves these for shaving his head!</li>
    <li> Yeah, as others mention, this is the absolute worst razor ever. I just came online to check to see what others were saying about it and to verify that it wasn&#x27;t just my experience with them. Complete waste of money as they were completely dull out of the package. Guess I&#x27;ll have to go back to my more expensive razor refills which I love; I was just hoping to save some money.</li>
    <li> I thought there was something wrong with the way I was shaving.  I had to go over and over and over with these razors. They do not take the hair completely off. Some spots it was like I never touch them with the razor.  Been shaving all my life. I don&#x27;t want to buy the Gillette, because it is a &amp;#34;cruelty &amp;#34;company. I thought I would try the Noxzema. Big mistake.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. Not worth it. I can&#x27;t believe Noxzema is selling such a terrible razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;They tore up my under arms and did not leave me with a clean shave.</li>
    <li> I bought these razors on sale, thinking that Noxzema was a trusted brand. I could not have been more wrong. They somehow manage to both remove all your skin, leaving you legs raw while NOT removing the hair. I suspect I&#x27;d get better results with those pink Daisy razors. Avoid at all costs, even if they are on sale.</li>
    <li> Fast easy &amp;  great price</li>
    <li> Works as well as the fancy ones for way cheaper</li>
    <li> Absolutely awful. The first shave wasn&#x27;t good - about the equivalent of the second or third day with a decent razor. The second day, it was so rough it felt like someone had taken it out and stropped it against the cement a few times. There was no third day - I tossed the package and bought Gillette. The quality was what I would have expected from a no-name brand bought at the Dollar Store, not from a reputable company like Noxzema. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great smooth shave. I shave my legs every day and they last about a week</li>
    <li> bought them since the brand is a well known one but i gues they should stick to what they are good at ie.. skincare creams etc. the razors gave me pretty bad cuts. would not recommend them. i guess gillette is the way to go in razors.</li>
    <li> They cut your skin but not your hair. Never again will I buy these!! Even the cheap bic razors are 100x better than these. They simply don&#x27;t cut any hair what so ever.</li>
    <li> best razor iv bought,,,,,,,,</li>
