      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very matte and invisible.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, tastes minty , doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue, prevented my lips from burning, and stayed put through swimming and drinking a lot of water.  </li>
      <li>and I find that isn&#x27;t very often.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Other than it having higher SPF of 30, there really isn&#x27;t anything special about it.</li>

      <li>I love this little guy.</li>
      <li>Makes my lips sticky, doesn&#x27;t hydrate, might actually make them more dry</li>
      <li>It feels just like normal lip balm and definitely protects from the sun.</li>
      <li>I would love it if it had a slight sweet taste as it does have a tiny bit of a &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; taste at times but very little and not enough for me to switch brands.</li>
      <li>I generally shun sunscreen in lip products because I don&#x27;t need it</li>
      <li>This is like a Chapstick and is white but applies clear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be busy picking chunks of dry chapped lip off regularly, especially in the winter.  </li>
      <li>Might be a little strong at times because the corners of my lips/facial skin sometimes get really dry and crack, which is not very comfortable.</li>

    <li> I used this lip sunscreen during spring break.  It goes on smoothly, tastes minty , doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue, prevented my lips from burning, and stayed put through swimming and drinking a lot of water.  My only complaint is that is melted fairly quickly during storage, which is frustrating when you spend nine hours in the sun.  In the summer, I&#x27;ll be sure to keep it in my cooler, which wasn&#x27;t an option for my trip abroad.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lip balm with a high spf, that also had a pleasant smell.  This fits the requirements nicely: has a nice subtle smell, lasts really well and goes on smooth. I love it and use it a lot. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Feels good when applied. Haven&#x27;t burned my lips yet.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing lip balm with SPF and no scent or taste of sunscreen.</li>
    <li> we trust KMF and use a lot  of their  stuff.  but we have found another lip balm in a different [jar-like] shape that is easier for us to keep track of</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the texture or the way it went on.  Too Chapstick-y and cakey. I only used it when I had nothing else.</li>
    <li> Must have for summer. Works great for my kids and me. No peeling fron dry lips.</li>
    <li> Many sunscreen lip balms make lips feel dry or goopy, not this one. It feels just like normal lip balm and definitely protects from the sun.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble finding this high SPF because i have had lip cancer and need protection</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell this is working as expected. Might be a little strong at times because the corners of my lips/facial skin sometimes get really dry and crack, which is not very comfortable. I&#x27;m still going to use it though.</li>
    <li> I love this lipbalm!  Historically I&#x27;ve been use to using Chapstick brand and my lips have always remained so chapped.  So much so, in fact, that I often wouldn&#x27;t even bother using it since it wasn&#x27;t much better than nothing.  I&#x27;d be busy picking chunks of dry chapped lip off regularly, especially in the winter.  I didn&#x27;t realize that the type of chapstick actually mattered.  How utterly foolish of me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shopping for something random on Amazon, as I often do, and i came upon some type of lipbalm.  Then it dawned on me to check reviews and maybe I can find one that actually works.  I ultimately settled on this one.  It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than Chapstick&#x27;s brand - and a lot of other brands - but there&#x27;s one hell of a reason for it.  It&#x27;s amazing!  It covers exceptionally well and stays on my lips for a good duration of time.  My lips have gone from sahara desert to baby&#x27;s bottom!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I&#x27;m going to be sticking with wonderful stuff going forward!</li>
    <li> Has a bad chemical taste. Could not use</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  Kiss my face is great because they don&#x27;t do animal testing, organic, all that jazz.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It has a neutral taste and smell, it makes my lips feel silky and nourished, and has high SPF value. I will be ordering many more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm especially for fun near sun! Glides on well, not mushy, and lasts long! Best is the SPF IN IT! Many lip balms do NOT have SPF,</li>
    <li> The best affordable sunscreen for your lips ever! 20% of this chapstick is active sun-protecting ingredients (3% avobenzone + 7% octinoxate + 2% octocrylene + 8% homosalate). Plus, it has a high amount of coconut oil, which is great for your skin! A lot of chapsticks just have beeswax.</li>
    <li> I love this little guy. It smells pepperminty and it feels tingly. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips the way (oddly enough) many lip balms do. And SPF is obviously a plus.</li>
    <li> My wife got this for me because I work outside all summer long. It doesn&#x27;t have any strange flavor or smell and I don&#x27;t have any cancer on my lips so I guess I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
    <li> Really fresh feeling. Love the extra SPF protection.</li>
    <li> smells like oranges, and I hope it works.  I wish someone would come up with a lip balm that has non carcinogenic sunscreen (like a zinc version)</li>
    <li> The best lip balm I have found and I&#x27;m somewhat of an expert.  Everyone I know that has tried mine - goes out and buys them.</li>
    <li> I generally shun sunscreen in lip products because I don&#x27;t need it but when I am going into the sun or going to be outside for any length of time, I reach for Kiss My Face Sport Lip Balm. This is like a Chapstick and is white but applies clear. There is a tingly sensation on my lips when I first apply it  (Think: Carmex) and then that goes away and there is no taste at all - or very little. This balm is thick and stays put for a long time. I like that it isn&#x27;t thin and greasy. I apply it whenever I feel like my lips need it and I find that isn&#x27;t very often. It lasts longer than most lip balms. I would love it if it had a slight sweet taste as it does have a tiny bit of a &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; taste at times but very little and not enough for me to switch brands. SPF 30 is plenty for me and it hydrates my lips as it protects them. It&#x27;s unisex and guys won&#x27;t feel like they are wearing gloss or any such thing. It&#x27;s very matte and invisible. And it keeps my lips from getting parched in the sun. 1 star off for the (very) slight sunscreen taste if I get it in my mouth but it&#x27;s very good and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;m fair skinned and the sun dries out my smoochers.  It&#x27;s not got the &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; taste that any other ones I&#x27;ve used has.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Light weight, stays on. Definitely protects my lips!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! The consistency is perfect, and it glides on easily. Plus, the SPF 30 ensures I am protecting my lips against sun damage and possible skin cancer. This balm also moisturizes quite well and lasts a long time. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great for the sun and beach</li>
    <li> has a nice feel. it&#x27;s not waxy, it&#x27;s not greasy. it is a lip balm, what more can i say.</li>
    <li> Not super impressed. Felt like drugstore brand Chapstick. It does have a good minty scent and goes on smoothly. Other than it having higher SPF of 30, there really isn&#x27;t anything special about it. I paid close to $5 which I think I overpaid. I&#x27;ll use what I have but will not buy again unless on deep discount.</li>
    <li> Really great. Normally lip balm with SPF&#x27;s taste nasty, but this doesn&#x27;t have a taste and makes my lips so soft. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Makes my lips sticky, doesn&#x27;t hydrate, might actually make them more dry</li>
    <li> Very strong taste, pleasant but strong</li>
    <li> Does well alone and I can wear under lipstick. also has a mild pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Moisture for the lips that protects!</li>
    <li> No yucky SPF aftertaste.</li>
