<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells really good. I use it for hand lotion not so much for body lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this wonderful Lavender organic lotion. Please stop putting mineral oil on your body!</li>
    <li> Avalon Organicx Lavendder Body Lotion is outstanding.  Smooth and easy to use.  Its lavender fragrance is as if you were walking through a field of lavender in the South of France.  Very authentic.  I am so glad this is being so on  AMAZON.</li>
    <li> The scent in this lotion is very nice, not too strong which is great as I can get headaches. It is also very moisturizing, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Really liked the &amp;#34;no greasy feeling&amp;#34; while a great lotion and awesome scent.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this I get it every year at Christmas</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth cream  however it should be mailed in a box as in the shrink wrap it smeared all over since the wrap pushed the pump down causing it so become all wet.</li>
    <li> I bought this body lotion in Lavender scent. I was told by a friend that Lavender repels mosquitoes so I thought I would try it.  Not only does it make my skin feel very soft but I&#x27;ve not had one mosquito bite!  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion it smells great</li>
    <li> I use a number of Avalon facial products which are great so I thought I&#x27;d try some of their other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmm I don&#x27;t know if its my body chemistry or an old bottle or what, but the scent did not last very long and worse IT DOES NOT smell like lavender - its more herbal than just lavender and the scent is very weak. It takes a while to absorb despite being relatively thin in viscosity, but my skin did feel nice and soft upon application. I can&#x27;t help but feel that it won&#x27;t be strong enough as a hand lotion - only body lotion. We&#x27;ll see in the coming days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed in this product. I&#x27;ll probably end up adding lavender essential oil to the lotion to try to boost the smell since the lotion itself is mostly ok and I bought it for the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> This lotion does not smell anything like lavender at all!  Not only that it has a funny smell also.  Disappointed.  But I have to say it feels nice.  Does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Just the right texture and scent.  Believe it or not, it not only helps you sleep it keeps all fleas at bay (when you have 8 dogs, this is an added plus!).  :)  Love this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells wonderful, but is very thick. It takes a while to rub it in fully. However, it is doing a great job moisturizing my skin.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this for my mother as a gift. She loved it so much I re-ordered for her and got one for myself.  It smells very nice and absorbs into your skin quickly not leaving you all greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  It smells wonderful, and works well to soften skin.  Great price too!!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells wonderful.  I really liked it.  My bottle had leaked a lot during shipping but I love the lotion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion, but the squirty thing doesn&#x27;t work.  In order to use it it is necasery to unscrew the whole cap.  Otherwise, the actual lotion is not too bad.</li>
    <li> Was recommended as a flea repellant and scent is not overpowering. Seemed to work.</li>
    <li> It has just the right amount of scent, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  Leaves no sticky after feel.Leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Lavender lotions. I love how pure the scent is. I have really dry skin though, and wish this lotion was a bit thicker.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this lavender lotion because I couldn&#x27;t find any lavender hand lotions at the stores where I looked. When I first put it on, I thought I was given the wrong product because it smelled so much like lemon juice and chemicals. I couldn&#x27;t detect any lavender scent. It also had a very sticky feel. When my husband came home, he asked what smelled bad before he even saw the bottle of lotion. I returned it and was refunded.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have ordered it before. This time I ordered both lavender and lemon. Lemon came all sealed. Lavender was loosely wrapped in a big plastic bag and had leaked all over. I did the return paperwork printout and returned it. Got a new one but it was still not sealed like the lemon. This one was wrapped in a smaller plastic bag that was stapled shut. It did not leak this time. I don&#x27;t know why the packaging is so different? I prefer cosmetics that are sealed.</li>
    <li> Not the same cream, something else in the bottle or it went bad. i threw it out and now only buy at Whole foods.</li>
    <li> The scent is way too strong. It makes me ill when I use it. I wish it had a nice, subtle scent.</li>
    <li> After reading an article by a breast cancer survivor who said that she now always uses only organic lotion I started to use them myself. She made the excellent point that the skin is the largest organ of the human body and to be rubbing chemicals into it everyday is not a good idea. And it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is great lotion. I use it mostly on my arms/hands right before bed, but it is a nice summer body moisturizer. It is not quite emollient enough for winter use, but it is perfect in the summer. It is never feels greasy, and the it smells like actual lavender.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion, but I cannot use it because the dispenser is faulty and will not work...I wish I could get a replacement.  It was purchased through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use all Avalon Organics, but this one the smell is over powering.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I use it 2-3 times a day. Have by sink in kitchen to use after dishpan hands!</li>
    <li> Great lotion wonderful smell</li>
    <li> a good hand moisturizer, with pleasant but not overpowering scent</li>
    <li> Great size, wonderful smell - the entire Avalon Organics line is a favorite.  This is not only a great product but looks good also ~ you don&#x27;t have to worry about another dispenser.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a nice aroma and goes on smoothly.  I was unable to find it in any stores near my home and it is a gift for a friend.</li>
    <li> The lotion itself is nice, goes on smooth, but the fragrance is a bit too overpowering for me (too perfumy... sp?).</li>
    <li> First of all, when it was shipped the top was open so I got and there was lotion everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there is a lingering smell after the initial lavender smell and it is not lavender.  I don&#x27;t know what it is but I hate it! It causes me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the lotion is sticky.</li>
    <li> The odor is too medicinal.</li>
    <li> Very nice lavender scent - not the cheap air-freshener lavender scent. It&#x27;s nicely moisturizing and not too heavy nor sticky.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried every lotion made and these are his favorite. A little more expensive but fits all his criteria. A great product. We would much rather order from amazon than take a chance on our local store not stocking the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> Smells so nice! No greasy feeling after either.</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling all around natural product.  It doesn&#x27;t have anything in it that would dry out your skin.  I recommend this product for the price.</li>
    <li> It is used by my wife and myself... excellent..</li>
    <li> I just purchased this lotion from Whole Foods- I remember buying it a few years ago and liking it.  This time around though, not a good experience.  When you first apply the lotion it does have a nice lavender scent, however, within a minute it feels sticky and the lavender scent disappears and leaves an odd after-smell.  To make it worse, I must have rubbed my face at one point and my cheek began to burn and flush.  I typically don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I am weary of a lotion that would cause this kind of reaction.  I will be returning it tomorrow, it&#x27;s awful.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion. It has the best scent.</li>
    <li> I live in Albuquerque, where dry skin is, well, like last year&#x27;s fallen leaves. I don&#x27;t know why this lotion is so much better than many others I&#x27;ve tried--some French and four times as expensive. It smooths on so nicely you just know it will last. And it does. For hours afterward it even seems to repel water. I keep it right next to my sink. I tried it because it&#x27;s organic and all the chemicals we&#x27;re applying to ourselves just can&#x27;t be good. But I didn&#x27;t expect it to be clearly superior. I plan to make this an inexpensive gift to just about every woman I know. The only skin care item I know of that works as well after it&#x27;s applied is pure lanoline--and of course that&#x27;s like smearing your hands with axle grease. The Avalon Organics is nearly as good for your skin as lanoline and a whole lot easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Gifted to someone and presumably enjoyed.</li>
    <li> Avalon lavender lotion and glycerine hand soap are great products.  The scent is fresh and the products are moisturizing and gentle to the skin. I would highly reccomend  both items-- especially if you enjoy the soothing scent of lavender.</li>
    <li> Good nice smelling shampoo. However it left my hair full of knots. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I love the lotion, but the bottle was crushed in shipping with half of it&#x27;s contents spilled out.  The bottle was also much smaller than the previous time I ordered it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> no odor will look for another brand to order when this is completed</li>
    <li> I love the lavender scent and the consistency of the lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to use as a body lotion, and it absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> The purists have sometimes spoken ill of this stuff, but it is the only product that relieves the itching I sometimes get from poison ivy contact.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t give 5 stars because it arrived with lotion all over the outside of the bottle. The lid was partially unscrewed. I don&#x27;t think very much of the lotion was lost otherwise I would have sent it back. But it shipped very quickly and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this lotion for several years now, but was so disappointed to use it.  The lavender scent is overwhelmed by some other scent which is not pleasing to me.  I wrote to find out why and never received a response.  Will not be buying it again and will dispose of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells okay, but not as nice as other lavender lotions I&#x27;ve used. What is most frustrating is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work. I contacted the vendor for a replacement pump and didn&#x27;t get an answer. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I put in on my body after shower.  But don&#x27;t use too much otherwise it smells very strong.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells heavenly.  I love the scent and the immediate comfort it gives my dry hands.  You don&#x27;t need much.  It&#x27;s not sticky and absorbs quickly.  The fragrance lingers a while.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week or two now and my hands and much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> As good as the high priced lavender lotions</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on smooth and smells great. I got it for my girlfriend for Valentine&#x27;s Day and out of the multitude of lotions she owns this is by far and away her favorite. She likes the fact that it is naturally made too so it doesn&#x27;t irritate her sensitive skin whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Have use this brand of lotion for years. Like it very much. Scent is very pleasant, lotions soak in quickly.</li>
    <li> Avalon Lavender SPF Lotion is good for summer aromatherapy and sunblock but not for winter because like most SPF creams it is chalky and dries the skin slightly so for moisturizing I suggest [[ASIN:B0013ALGTA Avalon non-SPF Lavender Lotion]] or [[ASIN:B0013KY296 Organix Neem Lotion]] or for hot weather the light and unscented [[ASIN:B00028OSJ4 Aloe Life Face &amp; Body]].</li>
    <li> This lotion arrived today... when I open the shipping box, I found that about 1/4 cup of lotion had leaked out of each of the two bottles and was floating inside the two plastic bags that were housing the individual bottles.  The lucky part was that the lotion had not escaped from the plastic bags and got onto the new book that arrived in the same box.  The nice part of cleaning up the \\&quot;mess\\&quot; was that my hands now smell marvelous...and they are not sticky:)</li>
    <li> One of my favorite hand lotions. The lavender scent is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It smells so good.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves the smell of lavender and uses hand and body lotion regularly so I took a chance and bought her some for Christmas.  She loved it and I think it smells pretty good, too.</li>
    <li> what other kinds of lavender body lotion do u have</li>
    <li> not at all lavender-ish....</li>
    <li> My all time favorite lotion! I buy it frequently and I love the wonderful lavender aroma and the silky lotion feel. It soaks into my skin nicely. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love Avalon Organics because their products contain so little &amp;#34;junk,&amp;#34; and they smell so good. Getting harder and harder to find in local stores, so I was glad to find this online. The Lavender lotion&#x27;s scent is so close to real lavender flowers, it&#x27;s very gentle and soothing. Highly recommended to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it.</li>
    <li> The product came early and was as advertised. There is no issue with the seller. The scent is horrendous though! If you like to smell like an old lady or old spice, then it&#x27;s perfect. I was just expecting something less stinky. A mellow scent considering that it&#x27;s lavender.</li>
    <li> I purchase a LOT of lotions and lavender is one of my favorite scents.  I&#x27;m picky about my lavender though.  I don&#x27;t like fake smelling lavender.  I really really love L&#x27;Occitaine lavender lotion but the outrageous price keeps my from buying it regularly.  This lotion is almost just as good.  It&#x27;s silky and smooth and absorbs nicely.  It&#x27;s not a super heavy fragrance either, it&#x27;s light and just right.  And this is a great price on Amazon!  I found the same lotion at Bartell Drug store for almost 3 times the price!</li>
    <li> This lotion absorbs quickly and the lavender scent is very pleasant, as it also has citrus notes. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> have used this product for years and not sure if it was a bad batch or avalon is using a new formula but it had a very bad odor and barely smelled like lavender.  I used to love that this was the one lotion I could buy that smelled like a pure lavender squeezed flower, but this particular batch did not unfortunately.  Went in the garbage because the smell was not pleasant.</li>
    <li> I bought this because a friend had it on her desk and I kept using it.  I love the scent and smoothness of the lotion.</li>
    <li> Nice hand cream, smells like a natural foods store (I personally like that smell). You need to apply it constantly but moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it--the lavender smells like real lavender, not like the perfumey or medicinal stuff you often find in lavender-scented lotions. It moisturizes really well, too, even in winter here in the north. I use this, or the rosemary-scented version, every day.</li>
    <li> The scent is not too strong and if the product is good I will re-order.</li>
    <li> Very expensive for creme that feel dry after a few minutes.  Trader Joe&#x27;s carries a similar cream for HALF the price.  I would love to love this but it is not what I had hoped it would be.  RATZ!</li>
    <li> Strong lavender scent and good moisturizing properties. I really like using this lotion for a neck massage. The lavender smell is so relaxing.</li>
