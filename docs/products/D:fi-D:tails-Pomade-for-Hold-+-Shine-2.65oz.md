      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Smells good and has a light hold.</li>
      <li>I imagine if someone has thicker, fuller hair, this may work better.  </li>
      <li>; movement convinced many grungy Gen X&#x27;ers like myself to get a haircut and prep up a bit.  </li>
      <li>as many of the reviews complain of.  </li>
      <li>It more liquidy and not quite</li>

      <li>Love this product -</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>This product has been discontinued according to my hair stylist, but Amazon still had some available.</li>
      <li>Make sure you get it fresh.</li>
      <li>It gives your hair a beautiful sheen and hold your style all day long.</li>
      <li>I give this product the highest rating because it is one of the greatest inventions for my soft loose curly hair.</li>

      <li>Had ordered product in past; liked it so much, I ordered two more.  </li>
      <li>Good if you are looking for a clean look, but not a lot of style capability for thick hair.</li>
      <li>When I first heard the news it literally ruined my day.</li>
      <li>None of them capture the magic of d:tails that helped me get all the girlies like I used to back in the day.  </li>
      <li>I was nervous about purchasing it because some of the reviews were not stellar, but my package arrived promptly and the product&#x27;s consistency was perfect and exactly like I had used in the past.</li>

      <li>What a surprise to see how your curls will last and the natural light weight of this product.</li>
      <li>Got2b Defiant Pomade - Pretty close replacement, has longer shelf life, but gets hard after many months.</li>
      <li>It used to be more firm and stayed in gel type status.</li>
      <li>Trying a lot of new stuff.</li>
      <li>Back in the day when Blink 182 and Sugar-ray were considered hot artists.</li>
      <li>I really thought I liked this product a lot, but found it was a little too heavy for my hair.  </li>
      <li>:fi and not as shiny Baxter of California Soft Water Pomade - Heavier than d</li>
      <li>:fi, not as shiny, odd smell Mitch Barber&#x27;s Classic - Not for those sensitive to perfumes Redken Polish Up Pomade - Not for those sensitive to perfumes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Had to return the product 2  the pomade was watery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Difi pomade for years until my beauty store stopped carrying it. I was so happy to find it on amazon. But I&#x27;m sadly disappointed. It&#x27;s not quite the same. It more liquidy and not quite the gel I used get.</li>
    <li> the pomade was liquid upon opening.  I believe due to extreme hot weather.  Love the product when not cooked.  Maybe only order in cooler months</li>
    <li> Bought 2; however, 1 was a liquid rather than solid...not sure if this was older product or not. The other was solid.</li>
    <li> At this time it was too liquidish and dripping than before.It used to be more firm and stayed in gel type status.</li>
    <li> Love this product - I have naturally curly, colored treated hair &amp; this product helps keep the curl but also gives my hair the control I need by keeping the frizz under control but not weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Love the product and have been using it for quite a while.  It gives your hair a beautiful sheen and hold your style all day long.</li>
    <li> Had ordered product in past; liked it so much, I ordered two more.  The quality was totally different.  It was liquid and not gel and in past.  would never order again. Would return, but decided postage would be so expensive, just throw away.</li>
    <li> I give this product the highest rating because it is one of the greatest inventions for my soft loose curly hair. One needs to only use a little bit on finger tips to apply on hair. What a surprise to see how your curls will last and the natural light weight of this product.</li>
    <li> I really thought I liked this product a lot, but found it was a little too heavy for my hair.  I have lots of medium-fine hair, and it get weighed down somewhat.  I imagine if someone has thicker, fuller hair, this may work better.  My stylist recommended a combination of Redkin Guts along with Redkin Rouge Paste #12.  The results of these two products in slightly damp hair with a blow dryer and vent brush produced fantastic results!</li>
    <li> It tends to make my hair feel too stiff.  I will continue to use it, but will think about reordering.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get this in the stores any more.  Ulta no longer carries it so I was happy to get it here.</li>
    <li> I bought a number of jars of this product on sale at a very low price.  When I got it it appeared very different from all of my previous purchases of this same product from other suppliers.  It appears as though it got overheated or aged to the point that it is no longer the consistency and color it should be but it seems to work reasonably well so I did not try to return it.  I&#x27;m afraid I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I like the hold and shine capabilities better than other products that I have used, and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> very greasy. Cannot use on my fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased a jar from Beauty Shine through Amazon and the product was great.  Reordered and it came from NewvoBeauty and this time it was runny and watery as many of the reviews complain of.  I think one vendor is selling bad product while the others are fine so be careful where its coming from.</li>
    <li> Had my hair short forever and finally grew it out. I have such beautiful thick hair so why not? :) Trying a lot of new stuff. My hair is very thick, and sometimes hard to manage. My stylist has to go to town with the thinning shears. This product worked best for me when I need a quick refresher in the morning. As in I am kinda hung over on a Saturday morning and am going to breakfast with a friend. Throw in a little water with this stuff and looks like I showered! Smells good and has a light hold. Good if you are looking for a clean look, but not a lot of style capability for thick hair. American Crew Grooming Cream is good for all day style and soft hold.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND USED TO BUY IT AT SUPERCUTS...BUT SUPERCUTS STOPPED CARRYING THIS BRAND...THEIR LOSS</li>
    <li> When I received this item it was almost liquid form.  Never turned gel like.</li>
    <li> This product has been discontinued according to my hair stylist, but Amazon still had some available. I was nervous about purchasing it because some of the reviews were not stellar, but my package arrived promptly and the product&#x27;s consistency was perfect and exactly like I had used in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel since 1999. Back in the day when Blink 182 and Sugar-ray were considered hot artists. Bands like them and the whole &amp;#34;metro&amp;#34; movement convinced many grungy Gen X&#x27;ers like myself to get a haircut and prep up a bit.  Sadly, like frosted tips, this product has run it&#x27;s course. When I first heard the news it literally ruined my day. How will I never get the hold+shine I require to be seen in public? This is a disaster and I can never leave the house again. I went through all the 5 stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Ice Cream.  After I snapped out of it I started trying other products with limited success. None of them capture the magic of d:tails that helped me get all the girlies like I used to back in the day.  I have found a few close replacements... Got2b Defiant Pomade - Pretty close replacement, has longer shelf life, but gets hard after many months. Make sure you get it fresh. Redken 03 Water Wax -  Heavier than d:fi and not as shiny Baxter of California Soft Water Pomade - Heavier than d:fi, not as shiny, odd smell Mitch Barber&#x27;s Classic - Not for those sensitive to perfumes Redken Polish Up Pomade - Not for those sensitive to perfumes</li>
    <li> PEOPLE!  DO NOT order this product!  My last order for $40.00 included 4 jars of the product.  On this order for $40.00 I got 1!!!  It&#x27;s a rip off.    Just opened the container.  The ingredients aren&#x27;t gel, but very watery...  Went to another web site.  Was able to purchase D:fi for $12.95 each.</li>
    <li> Receive products in good condition</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I wanted but the mistake was mine.  Thought it was something else.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Works great to add shine and hold!</li>
    <li> Caused my scalp to itch and had dandruff from using this product. Had to throw it away.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
