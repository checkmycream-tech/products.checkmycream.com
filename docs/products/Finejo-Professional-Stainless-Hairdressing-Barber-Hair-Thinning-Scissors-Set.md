    <li> Excellent hair cutting tool for the money.  I cut my wife&#x27;s hair, which is very thick and curly.  After watching 3 how to videos on Youtube I was ready to give it a try.  I saw two techniques; one where you slide the thinning scissors through the hair at an angle as you cut, and the other where you use the comb to lift the hair before cutting.  The comb-lift technique worked better for us.  The scissors were decent quality and the comb worked well.  I would recommend this product, but if you&#x27;ve never cut hair before like me, be sure to watch some videos first.  I commend my wife for having the guts to let me do this.  I&#x27;ll use the money we save on hair cuts to take her out to dinner.</li>
    <li> The best! Would do business with you again and again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The scissors do such a good job I was brave enough to cut my own hair. I even cut some bangs.</li>
    <li> its great very sharp didnt know ill be this sharp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will totally recommend has cool case and oil to keep it sharp</li>
    <li> This  product is really great because it works  great on hair I have try it and my  hair came out even if you want to save money on hair dressers I recommend this product and it was a fast delivery it took one week to get here.</li>
    <li> I needed a pair of scissors and didn&#x27;t want to spend a couple hundred bucks since I am not currently working in a salon. I bought these and another pair from a different company. The other ones were a bit more but complete junk. These are great and I would use them in the salon. Sharp and smooth. The thinning shears are a great also. No catching on the hair. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this once a month to keep my pixie cut in shape and it works super well for my needs.</li>
    <li> The scissors are not very sharps</li>
    <li> Great shears to use in between haircuts! Good buy for your money and they&#x27;re not cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Very nice set. Works well.</li>
