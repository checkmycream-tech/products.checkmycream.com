<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product, wish there was a paste like product too!</li>
    <li> we use nothing but this</li>
    <li> Immediately noticed a difference. Best on the market -- no xylitol, all good quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> mouth feels very clean after using it.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I had a great experience with the seller. I will purchase this product again in the future when I use up the items I purchase and need to buy replacements ! :) &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I is not helping to whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> Do what it says on the instructions, rinse your mouth with this when you arise in the AM and all bacteria will be gone!  Doesn&#x27;t have that toothpaste consistency and taste but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this brushing rinse; I ran out recently and my mouth just does not feel as clean.  I generally swish with this first, then brush.  They are not kidding around with the amount of hydrogen peroxide they use in this stuff, so, if you use it as a traditional mouthwash &amp; swish afterwards, you will need to rinse with water after you spit, otherwise the residue will keep a-foam&#x27;in.</li>
    <li> This is the best oral rinse (mouthwash) that I have ever used. Every tooth in my head has had dental work due to a childhood illness when I was very young . This product has made a mark improvement in my gum health. I want to keep my teeth and it takes a lot of afford to keep my gums healthly due to all the dental work. This brushing rinse had made it a little easier.</li>
    <li> Great substitute for the supermarket mouth washes without all of the toxic substances.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the smell, it tastes just fine. It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of foam, which is good. My mom tried, and she said it helped with her mount sores.</li>
    <li> This is a revelation for me. I love the clean sensation. It contains natural ingredients for a great oral hygiene</li>
    <li> This is such a great product that makes your mouth feel clean and revitalized.</li>
    <li> it test horrible i used it only 2 times coundn&#x27;t use it anymore</li>
    <li> I am happy to say the reviews are true.  I&#x27;ve been rinsing 2x daily (morning and night) for 2 weeks now and my teeth are CONSIDERABLY whiter.  Very noticeable and very pleased!  A great fresh and clean feeling afterward, not overpowering either!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as an alternative to harsh chemical whiteners. I use essential oils for a number of other reasons so I figured I should use them on my teeth, too. I also drink a fair amount of coffee as well as red wine...wanted something to help keep my teeth as white as possible without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about two weeks (use it morning and night, swish around for a few minutes after brushing and then use my toothbrush again on fronts of teeth). I can tell a difference in the short period that I&#x27;ve been using the rinse. I hope it continues to whiten but I&#x27;m happy with what it has done so far. Plus, it&#x27;s organic to boot...and priced very reasonably.</li>
    <li> I have used it to brush my teeth and as a rinse.  It has a pleasant flavor.  Great for minor irritations inside the mouth!  I am hooked.</li>
    <li> LOVE this mouthwash. I was on a mission to find glycerin free natural mouthwash. Apparantly more difficult than I thought...Enter this product. This was more than I was looking for. All organic with food grade hydrogen peroxide, essential oils, and aloe vera; this stuff is as good as it gets. I&#x27;ve felt a huge difference in the cleanliness and freshness of my teeth, mouth, and breath since I started using. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> will buy again. this is a staple in my house</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfectly minty, gentle on the tongue especially in the morning. I like it, my whole mouth stays clean. I use it between meals, I alternate using it with my other natural products for my teeth. It&#x27;s easy to use, easier than toothpaste because I can just gargle and brush with it. (During the day I just gargle and do a light brush to keep my enamel intact. I brush my tongue, my gums inside and out lightly, quickly... my teeth and gums are always very healthy)</li>
    <li> I have to say I was a bit reserved about using an organic mouthwash/toothpaste after dabbling with tee-tree oil products in the past. This stuff, however, is in a different category. I swish and gargle with it, then lightly brush my teeth with the residue. I find that not only does my mouth feel good, but after 2-3 weeks my teeth are noticeably whiter. To boot, there is not one questionable ingredient in the mixture -- no SLS, no fluoride, just hydrogen peroxide. Here is the full list of ingredients because they are not listed at this time:  Purified Water, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis  organic), Hydrogen Peroxide (food-grade), Peppermint Oil (organic essential oil), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil (organic essential oil), Lemon (Citrus Medica Limonium) Oil (organic essential oil), Clove Oil (organic essential oil), Eucalyptus Globulus (Eucalyptus) Leaf Oil (organic essential oil), Cinnamon Oil (organic essential oil)</li>
    <li> My teeth are no longer sensitive. My gums are healthier. All is well in my mouth. A great product.</li>
    <li> I think I might give this out as Xmas presents this year!  Yes, it&#x27;s that good !!  I told a few friends about it and have received emails thanking me for letting them know about it.  If my tooth aches, I just use some of this ... or the Collidal Silver ... but better to use this as too much of the silver is like taking an antibiotic and then you need to replenish your probiotics, but not with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a mouthwash and toothpaste &#x27;all in one&#x27; !!!  So worth the cost and it&#x27;s also a preventative for gums etc !!!</li>
    <li> Works great with coconut oil and baking soda for tooth past.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit different.  I tried brushing with it, but instead just use it like mouth rinse.  As far as whitening teeth, can&#x27;t really say...have been using only for about less than a month.  Will I buy again?....Probably not.</li>
    <li> this product tastes great and leaves my breath super fresh! I even wake up without morning breath, i bought this for my gum recession and i looove it! it really helps and i will be buying this product from now on- along with some tea tree oil. Great for oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> This is a light &amp;#34;anytime&amp;#34; mouthwash. Works well with Invisalign.</li>
    <li> I love how my mouth feels!  Wow- the Brushing Rinse is a fresh product which works really well.  I have had very deep pockets and bleeding gums in the past.  And now- both are gone.  My teeth are slowly whitening up after (3 months now) I realize I must have dense enamel.  The biggest immediate result is I am free of any bad breath day in and day out!  Just last week a small fleck of plaque popped out.  I am a fan!</li>
    <li> Kills all the germs naturally. No chemicals. Pleasant taste. Whitens teeth, cleans breath. I love this stuff and will always keep it on hand.You really should try it. You won&#x27;t be sorry. Trust me.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted a more natural mouthwash without a strong alcohol/ medicinal taste. For me the taste is very mild, clean and refreshing, and tolerable for swishing for extended periods. I used it as instructed to also brush my teeth, and it worked pretty well. (You&#x27;re supposed to swish around for about 30 seconds, spit out, and brush teeth with remnants) For reviewers who say it&#x27;s messy, I don&#x27;t think they understand how to use it correctly. I also liked the tip on the bottle about use in the morning before drinking water, so as not to swallow bacteria that&#x27;s accumulated in your mouth overnight.</li>
    <li> My first bottle of this brushing rinse has been great.  In addition to the cleansing qualities, it has been very helpful in reducing some tooth sensitivity too.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had a pocket in my gums where my molars are.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that it would work, but thought, hey, it&#x27;s cheaper than antibiotics from the dentist (and probably better in the long run... I&#x27;ll take antibiotics when needed but I do think they tend to be overused).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this and pronamel sensitive, alternating every few days (~3days rinse, 1 day pronamel).  IT WORKED!  I&#x27;m sold. I use it regularly now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years now and I have no complaints.  It was really nice to finally be able to find a product for my teeth without all of the gunk of national brands of toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Taste is neutral to me not heavy as you would expect this type natural product. It foams some not bad as it should. I have to finish bottle to decide if I will repurchase.So far so good. Beats commercial wash with coloring and harder taste.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever! I notice that after using this for about a month, my teeth are more solid in their sockets. Their color is lighter and brighter also, which surprised me since we smoke and drink coffee. We use this once a day in the morning. I add 1 drop and only one drop,  of Grapefruit Seed extract to my mouth after I have added the rinse and swish around and then brush the teeth. Great product. Great results.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste because there are a lot of so-called &amp;#34;organic toothpastes&amp;#34; that have a long list of strange ingredients in them, and I wanted to try something more natural. All of the ingredients in this toothpaste are easy to pronounce and you&#x27;re probably already familiar with them. I&#x27;ve read that this toothpaste can also whiten your teeth, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother has a digestive disorder and he gets nausea from most tooth pastes, this is one of the only two toothpastes that doesn&#x27;t give him nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Aloe Vera, Hydrogen Peroxide (food-grade), Peppermint Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Lemon Oil, Clove Oil, Eucalyptus Leaf Oil, Cinnamon Oil- all ingredients are organic.</li>
    <li> I get this at a better price on here vs. Whole Foods.  Makes my teeth whiter and like that it is natural.</li>
    <li> Foams up very nicely, and leaves a clean palette afterward.  Not the best tasting stuff, but  not bad either.</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to use and leave breath fresh . Product helps with gums and helps with brushing after meals</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I was given a free sample of the 4 oz bottle and within two days I could tell a difference in the color of my teeth.  It makes my teeth feel like they have just been cleaned but without the grit. My teeth are actually squeeky clean.  My gums are not bleeding and my breath is fresher.  Brushing Rinse and I will have a life long relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Lou - Portland</li>
    <li> Tastes good, probably makes my breath stay fresh BUT because my mouth chemistry builds plaque quickly,  I have to be very honest about the overall performance of this oxygen/hydro treatment.  It DOES NOT dissuade the formation of plaque even when used two or more times each day with full 2 minute brushing.  After less than one week from turning from Crest ProHealth to Essential Oxygen, my very clean bottom front teach were outlined in plaque deposit.  Evidence is in - it is not a solution for me.</li>
    <li> Still getting used to the taste, but that might not ever happen. I guess in all reality I cannot expect hydrogen peroxide to taste good though. (PS for the record, this tastes much better than the 3% food grade hydrogen peroxide EO sells) This product works very nicely when teemed up with some baking soda. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to see whitening yet, will update if I see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as I expected and feel very clean after use. I personally like to use HP rinse for a few moments, then brush with this. On my off days I will sometimes brush with this BR and then brush real quick with some OraMD so I have the super minty clean taste/feel that I&#x27;ve only found with OraMD.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is perfect for rinsing after brushing! I love the smell and the taste! I also love all of the natural ingredients. It is hard to find a mouthwash without GMO&#x27;s! Saccharin is terrible and this mouthwash is free of it.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this brushing rinse. It may not taste that good (and sort of makes a mess so lean over the sink!!) - but boy does it clean my teeth and breath! It foams up while brushing and leaves you with fresh breath, clean teeth and a knowledge you aren&#x27;t putting &amp;#34;sugar&amp;#34; onto your teeth like so many toothpastes do! It&#x27;s great to brush teeth or to just rinse after a meal. I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
    <li> I am about to purchase my third bottle of this wonderful rinse. I use it in addition to my Squiggle toothpaste and my OraWellness tooth oil. This rinse makes my teeth so white and my breath wonderful! Sometimes I rinse w the BR and add a drop ofthe OraWellness to it. The bomb!! I only drink coffee on occasion but do drink tea alot. I can keep my teeth a healthy looking white without any additional bleaching. Now disclaimer my teeth weren&#x27;t horrible yellow either but not bleached white, still works very well for me and my needs. You will love it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I use it with my airfloss every night and it leaves my mouth feeling very clean, even after i&#x27;ve juiced garlic.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash is amazing!! I was looking for something to help me since I suffer from chronic canker sores. Or shall I say I used to suffer. Ever since using this product, it has reduced the amount of canker sores I get by a whole lot! It has been amazing to finally find a product that has been nothing short of a miracle. I&#x27;ve tried so many things and finally found Something that really works!  It also leaves your mouth fresh and clean. And it doesn&#x27;t burn like those other mouth rinses. I mean, What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> This is a okay brushing rinse and it would have gotten lower if it wasn&#x27;t for being organic. This is basically just hydrogen peroxide in a smaller bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint taste is lacking and at times I can&#x27;t even taste it. It would cost me less to just buy the peroxide and peppermint and make my own.</li>
    <li> Item as described and sent out in timely manner.  Our family uses this product with baking soda as our main toothpaste.  No glycerin to coat our teeth and it helps decrease the tarter build up.</li>
    <li> It rinses thoroughly, without any after taste or burn. The rinse allows my breath to stay fresh for extensive period of time.</li>
    <li> Works quite well; I use it for minor mouth irritations/sores/inner cheek bites/scrapes/&amp;#34;pizza burns&amp;#34; and so far, always with great and quick success.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> suggested to me, good for gums and trying to not have gum surgery using with waterpic</li>
    <li> This brushing rinse leaves my mouth and teeth so fresh and clean like nothing else.  I have been using it for over 1 year, can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Like to rinse with this product right away in the morning when I get up. Use it several times a day. Very refreshing!</li>
    <li> I was very sceptical at first but WOW this stuff is amazing. My mouth is cleaner then leaving the dentist office every day. Little to no taste very slight peroxide afterwards. You don&#x27;t have a mouth overflowing with foam either. I have also notice that I have very little plaque in the morning when I use it at night. It is fantastic and I recommend everyone at least try it.</li>
    <li> It tastes great, it&#x27;s not poisonous in any way, and it works. It also really helps to take the pain away from tooth decay.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. kills germs but a bit pricey</li>
    <li> I will buy this again.  Wonderful product.  I will update after my next dental visit. It takes only a small amount to swish and brush so do not let the price stop you.</li>
    <li> This product works great! I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This rinse reduces healing time for mouth sores (aka times when you may bite your cheek or burn your tongue!). I also occasionally have sensitive teeth problems and when I do I will use this rinse exclusively. I use just enough to swish with, which is about the reccomended 1/3 oz. I find that a bottle lasts at least 6 months or more for me since I only use it in the morning and for when I have issues.</li>
    <li> Used after oral surgery. The Dr. said I healed in record time!</li>
    <li> Got here quickly. I love this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your mouth feel super clean...without burning. I WILL be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Tastes more like hydrogen peroxide than peppermint, and it keeps foaming even after rinsing my mouth with water.  The only pro is I think it works well, but it&#x27;s gross to use so I won&#x27;t be buying again.  I&#x27;m surprised at how many people like the taste and feel of this.  It&#x27;s like the people who make their own toothpaste out of coconut oil and say it&#x27;s great, when it&#x27;s totally disgusting lol.  -Natalie</li>
    <li> Pleasant enough taste, no added chemicals like the big commercial brands.  I also use the food grade hydrogen peroxide, which has no taste at all. Even though this one is more refreshing, the peroxide foams in my mouth so it feels like it works better.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product at the DC Greenfest and was skeptical, but bought the small bottle to try. After a few days, maybe a week, I noticed might teeth were already a shade whiter, my gums and teeth felt healthier and dentist clean. Now, after having it for a few months, I bought the large bottle, my teeth are two to three shades whiter, my gums are much healthier, less pockets and no bleeding. This product is amazing. The only thing I still do is sometimes gargle with a Fluoride rinse as this product does not have fluoride in it. I won&#x27;t go back to toothpaste if I can help it.</li>
    <li> Works just as described, doesn&#x27;t taste very pepperminty but all in all an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and I find this product really helps if I use it before brushing.  I have been using it for over a year and nothing I have found helps with the sensitivity like this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite mouthwashes because it does not have an after taste and it whitens my teeth.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> Entire family uses this brushing rinse and likes it. Swishing in mouth for a few minutes before brushing seems to benefit the cleaning process.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. I am unable to use whitening products on my teeth because of the chemicals in them. This product has whitened my teeth about 6 shades! Makes me teeth feel so clean.</li>
    <li> I found a small bottle at my local health food store and it sounded interesting so I bought it. My routine has been to brush, floss and now rinse with this. I found it so effective I had to buy a huge bottle :). My teeth are whiter, cleaner and my feeling is after flossing the peroxide gets in between my teeth and into the gums hopefully killing the germs that cause tooth decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is mild. Tastes like peroxide :p it does have a list of ingredients like mint which give it a hint of minty flavor but mostly tastes like peroxide. It isn&#x27;t the worst tasting thing ever that is for sure but better than burning listerine!</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible, tastes just like baking soda.....Waste of money</li>
    <li> What can i say? Its simple... i have been using hydrogen peroxide for about 6 months. I pour it on my toothbrush, either with or without toothpaste. Usually put on the paste then peroxide. Try to spread paste evenly in my before brushing. Then brush and add more peroxide as i go. This product is not for anyone who is not going to be able to handle the peroxide or the herbals like clove. If you&#x27;re into holistic stuff and have used peroxide before you will not be disappointed in this product. It really soothes my highly irritated sinuses as well (when i use it on the roof of my mouth -via toothbrush- the effect is obvious). Superior effects on the dry mouth type of white gunk on your tongue. Eliminates it! Has really soothed any type of cavities i haven&#x27;t been to Dr for  yet. I believe it is really holding off the germs. Happy, healthy mouth and gums :-)</li>
    <li> Dry mouth leaves your mouth tasting and smelling so bad. Mouthwashes burn, even the ones that are alcohol free. You can use thise to brush your teeth or rinse with after you brush. It cuts the bad breath right away! I would recommend this to anyone who has chronic dry mouth or just chronic bad breath.</li>
    <li> I have been using this almost 2 years and it is so nice to not have the harsh chemicals.  My mouth feels clean after using and my teeth sensitivity is greatly reduced.  Plaque has really improved.  This has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> What I expected: paste/gel (anything denser than water) like fluid with decent mint smell that I could actually brush my teeth with and then swish it around as mouthwash. Something that would actually work as toothpaste and make my teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got: water with extremely weak hint of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 1% hydrogen peroxide solution that has some added scent/oils, but they are so weak that you can&#x27;t smell it yourself. I can smell being 1&amp;#34; from my wife&#x27;s mouth. It&#x27;s so watery, that claiming that it&#x27;s toothpaste is just preposterous. Very hard to keep in your mouth without spilling. All the cleaning is done with your brush and be prepared to do it for way longer than 2 minutes - and it will still leave your teeth feeling dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#x27;t the manufacturer call it what it is - a mouthwash. Very, very, very overpriced one.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and skip it, if you want a toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, DIY with hydrogen peroxide, real mint or mint oil and make it stronger.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. A holistic dentist recommended it and I have been hooked ever since. I went to the dentist for a cleaning last month and the hygienist THANKED ME &amp;#34;for having nothing to clean.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not sure if this rinse caused that outcome or if changing my diet and giving up all sugar for one month did the trick. I used to use drug-store hydrogen peroxide on my teeth, but this is much less harsh. It doesn&#x27;t strongly freshen the scent of your mouth, so I still use a natural toothpaste occasionally when I want that extra &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; breath. My husband loves this too. He says he can&#x27;t &amp;#34;not rinse&amp;#34; with this this in the morning now that he read about how it kills the bacteria that multiply in our mouths all night!</li>
    <li> Works extremely well rinsing inside of mouth and teeth.  It&#x27;s refreshing and contains all natural  ingredients.,</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it every morning and my mouth feels so clean! I also go through less toothpaste since I don&#x27;t need it when I use Brushing Rinse. I tend to get swollen gums occasionally and this stuff keeps them at bay. I also oil pull which has helped my sensitive teeth immensely! (look it up!)</li>
    <li> **ATTENTION COFFEE DRINKERS: THIS PRODUCT REALLY BRIGHTENS YOUR TEETH!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! IT&#x27;S WORTH BUYING!</li>
    <li> For 10 months I had a blister on my gums. It started out as a blood blister and when it popped it became infected. I went to my dentist who said, after many tests and x-rays, that it was NOT an abscess (wrong place, tooth root fine and those around it.) Gums were otherwise healthy and I&#x27;m a regular brusher/flosser. He prescribed me antibiotics and told me that would knock it out. Well, it didn&#x27;t. This persisted. I finally began to put some hydrogen peroxide on it using a q-tip and this did help it but it didn&#x27;t go away. I remembered I had used this before as a mouth wash and decided to give it a try using as directed, since it uses food grade peroxide. Well, after a day it was improving and now 2 weeks out the infection is completely healed and gone. I am amazed and grateful.</li>
    <li> I started using this about two months before my last dental cleaning, I have been happy with how fresh my mouth feels, and it has eliminated the sensitivity I usually had in a couple areas. The hygienist raved about how nice my teeth are, and said to keep doing whatever I&#x27;m doing. I felt that she did considerably less scraping than she normally does -- I am curious now to see if it&#x27;s even better next time since I am using the product starting with freshly cleaned teeth. I feel confident giving it to my son, who just got braces, because of the natural and food-grade ingredients. I intend to keep using this.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but worth it. Give your teeth the most prevention you can find.</li>
    <li> Does not seem strong enough. The taste is blah, not enough peppermint to freshen just enough to know it&#x27;s there. Wil, not be buying again.</li>
    <li> very nice to add to your water pik to help keep the water fresh and your mouth too.</li>
    <li> After years of feeling extremely nauseous after brushing my teeth and finding out the true horror of fluoride I was lead to this product. After only a few uses my teeth are noticeably whiter, my teeth stay cleaner and my breath stays fresher for longer and no more nausea. It&#x27;s also already starting to heal the damage done by brushing my teeth with poison and chemicals all my life. I recommend this product to anyone and everyone who doesn&#x27;t want to brush their teeth with something that needs a warning label.</li>
    <li> Good Rinse...doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of unnecessary, potentially harmful ingredients, which really draws me to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the directions are rather strange. It asks you to keep the mouthwash in your mouth the entire time while brushing, which proves to be very difficult and rather messy. especially since I use a Sonicare Diamond Clean toothbrush, which is extremely powerful.. It also seems to dissolve my toothpaste, which sounds strange, I know, but for some reason my toothpaste is gone immediately when I follow the suggested directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to contact the company to ask about this (via their provided email address) and they never respond. I question if it&#x27;s time to look elsewhere, but the ingredient profile is just so great and other natural mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried have been so-so, so I may just continue to work with it for a while.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. We use it as a mouthwash and as well as brushing with it. I also love that it is organic with no harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now and felt good. Each time I brushed and use this rinse my mouth feels fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mouth wash. It has become my favorite out of the many organic mouth rinses I have tried.</li>
    <li> I just got this, however I KNOW I will order this again. The fact that it is a rinse that turns into a toothpaste is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Your mouth feels super clean, especially if you have gum problems.</li>
    <li> I met the lady who developed this product at our local Whole Foods. She told me she developed this product to save her teeth as she had severe periodontitis and that it worked for her (and her teeth looked great)! I don&#x27;t have that issue, but I will say I LOVE this product. Makes my whole mouth feel clean without the severity of the normal mouthwashes. And all natural ingredients. I was a bit concerned about the fact that it has hydrogen peroxide in it, but I have not experienced any tooth sensitivity and my teeth do seem whiter. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The verdict is in...after going to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned today, I had to cheer. My battle with periodontis is over. I had the best report from the hygienist who wanted to know what made such a difference in the condition of my gums. And my teeth are a bit whiter to boot. The dentist wants to know the name of the mouthwash I am using...they always are looking for things that work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow a regular routine of flossing/electric toothbrush/rinsing with Essential Oxygen/sometimes use the flossing toothpicks (at night). In the morning I brush with the EO rinse. Easy, works great! I have been using this product for about 6 months now. Found it at a local food coop when I needed a small bottle for a trip to Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the cost? It lasts a long time if you aren&#x27;t excessive with how much you use every time. However, the ease of my dental cleaning, the lack of tartar on my teeth and the change to my gums so they are now healthy, is enough to make the extra expense well worth it (if there really IS an extra expense...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Listerine. Not even close in terms of gum health, not to mention how bad it tastes and how many chemicals it has in it.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes that this was going to be a great gum &amp; teeth care product. However, I was very disappointed to note that at about the one month continuous, daily use (carefully following directions,) I noticed that the enamel on three of my teeth was beginning to peel! That can only be the food grade hydrogen peroxide,.. which I know is great stuff as a healing agent,  but it needs to be properly diluted. For my teeth, this was too strong a mixture.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now switched to PerioBrite toothpaste and PerioRub, which I learned about reading Amazon customer reviews. These products contain a great combo of herbs,.. and no enamel damaging ingredients. I&#x27;m hopeful these are going to work very well for me,.. and the peeling has subsided, which is very good news. Sadly, I don&#x27;t think enamel comes back, but at least it&#x27;s not going to be further exacerbated with the concentrated H2O2.</li>
    <li> reduce tooth sensitivity. If anything, i would think it increases tooth sensitivity since hydrogen peroxide is a weak acid that, in much higher percentages (&gt;38%), would erode tooth enamel. I know the company owner has a habit of replying to reviews on amazon, so please tell me how an acid and bleaching agent could reduce tooth sensitivity. I have used the product three times with more than 8 hours in between each time (each time rinsing for about 2.5 - 3 minutes), and I feel a slight increase in tooth sensitivity to room temperature water (indoor San Francisco winter weather). I used to never have sensitivity except for when eating ice cream; i just turned 22 a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, is it advisable for me to put some baking soda into this product to raise the PH?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product lives up to the rest of its claims. I like it. However, if the owner cannot reply to this by explaining how hydrogen peroxide could reduce tooth sensitivity, then the claim is dishonest, and should be removed from the label.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Many standard toothpaste products (and I had tried a lot of them) irritate the inside of my cheeks, causing unpleasant effects. I was also looking for something more natural as I have been trying to eliminate chemicals from my daily routine. I stumbled across this product while researching a toothpaste alternative. I was a bit skeptical, but decided to give it a shot. At that point, it had just been added to Amazon, was not a \\&quot;Prime\\&quot; product and had no reviews, but I decided to try it based on information I found on another site. I am so glad that I did! It leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh, no irritation for me anymore and it even made my teeth whiter. Best of all, I have been using this product exclusively for the past six months with an occasional baking soda scrub and I just had my 6-month dental check-up/cleaning. The hygienist could not stop gushing about how CLEAN my teeth were and that I had LITERALLY NO PLAQUE!! This was very exciting news because I was a little nervous about ditching the traditional toothpaste method that most people recommend and what effect that might have on my teeth. In short, I love this product, I will recommend it to everyone I know and I will be using it for life!</li>
    <li> This stuff cleans my teeth like no other product I&#x27;ve ever used, plus no yucky aftertaste. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now! It&#x27;s too soon to tell whitening effects (2 weeks) but if I see a noticeable change I will report back. Even if I don&#x27;t, this Brushing Rinse is still worth 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> My gums are so much healthier since I switched to this and threw the toothpaste away. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with my teeth all my life due to never have received braces and having crooked, tight teeth.  I have always hated going to the dentist because of all the lectures about how I don&#x27;t do anything right in their book.  After going thru another \\&quot;fun\\&quot; event in the dentist chair for the cleaning and lectures, I decided to see if I could find a wonderful mouthwash.  Well, 6 months later the test came.  I went to the dentist and the dental hygienist said to me, \\&quot;YOU HARDLY HAVE ANY PLAQUE BUILDUP AT ALL.\\&quot;  I wanted to jump up and down and shout for joy but I just sat in the chair happy for one time in my life that I would not get another, \\&quot;you&#x27;re stupid\\&quot; lecture about not doing something right.  I have also always had the lecture about my gums being so horrible that I was doomed and heard this time how wonderful my gums were and no bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I do daily to avoid lectures:  I use a floss pick at least one time sometimes two times a day, then I brush with Crest twice a day since all the natural toothpastes have done nothing for me personally.  After that I use 1 tsp. of the Brushing Rinse.  I swish it around as long as I can, spit some out, then I take my toothbrush and brush around all my teeth, and then I rinse with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brushing Rinse is expensive but it does last a long time with only using 1 tsp. per day and maybe sometimes twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing, I have read numerous times how if you drink orange juice, because of the acid, you should wait half an hour before brushing or you could lose your enamel.  I also am very careful about not eating hard candies or sour candies due to them harming your teeth.  I also use a pick to get out food particles after I eat that are lurking in my mouth and rinse with water.  These are just a few tips from my own experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the test and see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> My teeth and gums are in bad shape and this is the ONLY thing that prevents my sensitive teeth from hurting when I eat and drink.</li>
    <li> Great taste and really helped gums that are too sensitive to regular mouth rinse.  It is a little pricey with shipping.</li>
    <li> If this stuff didn&#x27;t cost so much I&#x27;d buy a lifetime supply</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now and love it!  It is pure and organic.&lt;br /&gt;The woman who created this brushing rinse was having serious oral health challenges and created this product as a result.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely filled a void in the natural product industry that was very much needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read a detailed review I wrote about this product by clicking on my user name and then click on the link to my website and there you can search for the company review on \\&quot;Essential Oxygen.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Namaste!&lt;br /&gt;Chef Mindy</li>
    <li> My sister advised me about this rinse as my husband has gingivitis and gets embarrassed about his breath quite often.  He started using this and we no longer smell the gingivitis and his mouth feels cleaner.  We will continue to use this as it cleans and refreshes.</li>
    <li> love this mouthwash, makes my teeth sparkly clean and breath in control</li>
    <li> I really like this brushing wash. It makes your mouth feel so clean and helps to heal any mouth sores.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this stuff, gets the tricky small bits out of my teeth between brushing and helps with tea/coffee stains. Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and no gross mouthwash taste. Natural minty, spicy and fresh!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it really helped for plaque as a mouthwash. While using I developed some sensitivity in my teeth and my dentist told me that it&#x27;s because I was using a peroxide mouthwash. After I stopped my sensitivity went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work as a &amp;#34;brushing rinse&amp;#34; it just spills everywhere. Just use toothpaste. You can easily get natural toothpaste or use Listerine Original which is just alcohol and essential oils. That&#x27;s what my dentist recommended, and said it was the only mouthwash that has decades of science to back it up. Not that I always trust our health care industry.. but I do trust her in particular.</li>
    <li> I was told about this brushing rinse by my aunt, so I ordered it and I absolutely love it.  Clean and refreshing feeling.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic, clean way to brush your teeth.  I got off grocery store toothpaste years ago, they are loaded with fluoride and sugars that keep you going to the dentist.  I tried Redmond toothpaste, but it didn&#x27;t help bad breath very much.  Then I tried this Brushing Rinse, and I love it, although it&#x27;s not the only thing we use to clean our teeth. You can squirt it right from the bottle into your mouth, it&#x27;s no mess.  Shake the bottle first, it helps distribute the essential oils. I use this in the morning right when I wake up, swish around and spit.  I also brush my teeth with organic coconut oil and diatomaceous earth, although, I frequently just use coconut oil!  My teeth are cleaner when I go in for my dental checkups and cleaning, and my gums are so much healthier.  My teeth have been sensitive my whole life, and they are not anymore.  Dentists will tell you that peroxide will make your teeth sensitive, but it doesn&#x27;t, they lie because they want to sell you on their expensive and poisonous fluoride treatments.  Hey, it&#x27;s harsh, but very true.  Anyway, my husband brushes using straight peroxide, but I was never able to tolerate the taste very well.  I have also replaced his junky grocery store hydrogen peroxide (the brown bottle, its full of metals).  He uses the Essential Oxygen food grade peroxide for brushing his teeth, and I have tried it, it doesn&#x27;t have the nasty taste that the old brown bottle kind had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Essential Oxygen brushing rinse tastes great, it foams and debrides, I just love it.  It does have essential oils, but they are not overpowering.  Don&#x27;t expect the &#x27;pow&#x27; you get from using regular mouthwashes (which by the way, Listerine and other high alcohol mouthwashes have been linked to throat cancer cases.  http://www.pharmawatchdog.com/listerine-and-oral-cancer-is-there-a-connection ).  Essential Oxygen Brushing Rinse is a natural product that cleans your teeth well and improves the health of your mouth.  Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I use as a pre-brush and I think that it works well with my tooth brushing routine. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Update in 2014: As I am sure most of you have seen, the company has dropped the word \\&quot;Toothpaste\\&quot; from their redesigned \\&quot;New Look\\&quot; bottles. This product is no longer subtitled (or referred to as) \\&quot;Toothpaste + Mouthwash.\\&quot; I am glad they have done this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential Oxygen calls this product \\&quot;Brushing Rinse Toothpaste + Mouthwash.\\&quot; But it absolutely is not toothpaste. It is 100% watery-like liquid. You pour 1/3 of an ounce of the liquid into your mouth and are supposed to start brushing immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this is is 1% Food-Grade Hydrogen Peroxide. The company claims that this 1% Peroxide will whiten your teeth, fight gingivitis and plaque, decrease tooth sensitivity, fight bad breath, fight canker sores, fight tartar, and give you healthier gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! Amazing claims. (And right there on the bottle, they say \\&quot;It Works.\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, are we to assume that 1% Hydrogen Peroxide is a miracle for our teeth and mouth? If 1% Hydrogen Peroxide can really do all that stuff, why isn&#x27;t the ADA and every dentist pushing it? Why doesn&#x27;t Colgate and Crest go out of business? (Or at the least, market their own 1% Hydrogen Peroxide as \\&quot;toothpaste\\&quot; the way Essential Oxygen is doing?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential Oxygen does write on the label: \\&quot;These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ask you: Do we believe their incredible claims of what this product can do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if 1% Food-Grade Hydrogen Peroxide can really do all that stuff, where has it been all my life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 16-ounce bottle will last you 48 teeth brushings, assuming you use exactly 1/3 ounce each time. If you brush twice a day, like most people do, you will have to buy a new $13 bottle approx. every 3 weeks. (I guess you could simply buy your own very inexpensive 1% Food-Grade Hydrogen Peroxide, if money is tight.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other ingredients in the bottle: purified water, organic aloe vera, organic essential oils of peppermint, rosemary, eucalyptus, lemon, clove, and cinnamon. (I have no idea if any of these ingredients do anything except add flavor and/or texture.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is fine to me. Mild. Non-stinging. The peroxide fizzes/bubbles as you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to shake the bottle before use. Even with the lid tight, some liquid leaks from the top. (That just could mean I got a defective bottle.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am done brushing, my teeth do not feel as clean as when I am done using \\&quot;real toothpaste\\&quot; (but maybe they are...and maybe I just do not have the confidence they are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 3 stars (meaning \\&quot;It&#x27;s OK\\&quot;) because I feel they are doing a disservice--and are certainly being misleading--by calling it \\&quot;Toothpaste\\&quot; right there on the bottle. It is not toothpaste. Why not call it \\&quot;Tooth Cleaner\\&quot;? \\&quot;Tooth Liquid\\&quot;? It is not paste. Yeah, it could be called \\&quot;Brushing Rinse Teeth Cleaner + Mouthwash.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see clinical studies that prove hydrogen peroxide stops teeth sensitivity (I am sure Sensodyne would be interested to see that too.) Same goes with studies proving hydrogen peroxide prevents tartar build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for 2 weeks, I have not noticed any remarkable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love for all of their claims about this product to be true. I would love for it to whiten my teeth, prevent plaque and tartar, keep my gums healthy, and decrease teeth sensitivity to cold.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting use to when your use to tube tooth paste. I&#x27;ve actually  been using both liquid and paste.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad about this,but did not do anything special for me. I purchased it in hopes of it whitening my teeth the way many others said it did for them. Unfortunately nothing happened. I want to disclose however,that my teeth never have been white so it most likely is not the product that did not do the job, but more like my teeth are not capable of being snow white much to my dismay.  If you only have regular food stains or beverage stains I would imagine this will work as folks stated.  If you have age related yellowness probably not.</li>
    <li> I love this brushing rinse! I decided several years ago to stop using toothpaste that is filled with artificial colors and sugars. I went through the main name brands - Tom&#x27;s and Nature&#x27;s Gate, and never really felt that my teeth were clean. My dentist was on my case about using Listerine on a regular basis, but I wanted to avoid that for similar reasons - artificial color, tastes like gargling Windex with sugar, etc. So I was thrilled to find this product! My mouth feels extremely clean after using it, and it doubles as a mouthwash. The brushing rinse concept is something to get used to after years of toothpaste, but totally worth the switch!</li>
    <li> I have been buying and using this brushing rinse for over a year, and I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about it. It healed my gums and it has kept them healthy, and it&#x27;s fantastic for my teeth. It must be working well, because my dental check-ups have been stellar since I began using this exclusively. Most toothpastes are full of ingredients that will harm your teeth and gums - even the so-called healthy toothpastes have questionable ingredients. This brushing rinse is full of good stuff that cleans your teeth and gums nicely without causing irritation or doing anything that will soften enamel and harm your teeth. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I am happy it&#x27;s around to buy and use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve continually ordered this brushing rinse because it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean, and there&#x27;s no burning sensation.</li>
    <li> It tastes very nice and help my gums feeling so good!  It heals my gum.</li>
    <li> Not bad on the taste mainly use it as a rinse not for brushing and my mouth feels clean with out the burn</li>
    <li> Who needs toothpaste when you use this! It kills the germs with out any unnecessary chemicals.</li>
    <li> This was the first time trying out a brushing rinse toothpaste and I can&#x27;t say I have many complaints.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle doesn&#x27;t really hold as much as you would initially guess, but thats probably the only issue I&#x27;ve had with it.&lt;br /&gt;It foams up nicely, and leaves a clean feeling in my mouth when I am done.</li>
    <li> Tastes TERRIBLE!! Maybe it does what it claims, but I won&#x27;t be using this again because...YUCK, the taste! Save your money and buy something else...</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this woorks for brushing. Dissidented</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural type of rinse.  This one is refreshing, but it comes with a flip up shampoo type cap.  So, you have to have a separate glass to use it.  I prefer products where the cap can double as a little cup.  I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
