<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have purchased several nail clippers from drug stores etc. The only ones I can find are small and fall out of your hands and are dull. The newest ones are dull and instead of &amp;#34;clipping&amp;#34; they tear your nail and leave a rough edge. My wife is always online shopping and researching. I said to her &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care the price just please research nail clippers and find me the best ones out there&amp;#34;. She said they will arrive in a couple days. Well let me say this.....SHE NAILED IT!  I love them. They look and feel great. The quality and feel of the stainless steel feels great.they are large enough to hold and actually make that &amp;#34;clipping noise&amp;#34;. Very sharp and a clean cut. I was also surprised to see they came with an equally nice pair of toenail clippers. Exact same quality and performance. I really like how they have a curve to them instead of the normal straight ones. It would be cool if they came in a nice small wooden storage box. I would pay a few dollars more.</li>
    <li> The set is sharp and precise and feels comfortable in your hand.  Definitely clips your nail and doesn&#x27;t tear it.  Built-in file (take off the protective blue cover) and handy carrying pouch.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these!  Very high end clippers.  To be perfectly honest we have had a hard time finding clippers that would cut our toenails.  I think that comes with age...haha.  But these work perfect!  Highly recommended.  Shipping was awesome and packaging was great!  I will order another pair of these in the future.</li>
    <li> Finally, a well made clipper. These aren&#x27;t like the clippers you&#x27;ll find in the drug store. They&#x27;re excellent quality clippers at a great price.</li>
    <li> Best Quality nail clippers I&#x27;ve used yet. These Haperton nail clippers cut cleanly and have a nice smooth finish with a solid quality feel.  I like the handy nail file board that is built-in under the handle.  5 star excellence!</li>
    <li> I have bought four pair of toe nail clippers in the past two years... I have thick nails due to age old fungus... these nail cutters work great. Could not ask for a better set and the heavy and sharp stainless steel construction is excellent.</li>
    <li> Beautifully designed and excellently constructed!</li>
    <li> The nail clippers arrived on time and were even better than I expected. They have an excellent feel of quality about them, are razor sharp and are actually very classy looking for nail clippers. I have fairly heavy fingers and most all others I tried were awkward to hold without them slipping in my grip while I was trying to use them - not these. They were packaged very nicely and included some literature and information that showed that this company actually cares about the quality of their product and their customer&#x27;s satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Ordered these clippers based on the great reviews. As others have noted, they are really nice, sharp clippers that make clean cuts with little effort. I like that you get 2 clippers, a regular size one for fingers and a larger one for toes. They cost a little more than the ones you find in many drug stores, but they are clearly of higher quality and built to last. The built in file works great, too. I don&#x27;t know of any other company that follows up on your purchase of nail clippers to make sure you are satisfied with the clippers, and this indicates how much they are committed to providing great customer service. I am happy with these clippers and I&#x27;m sure you will be, also.</li>
    <li> Seem sharp, build quality is higher than average. Lever is thick and doesn&#x27;t bend/flex like many other nail clippers.</li>
    <li> These work great and look very stylish.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect cutting with no irregular edges.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Very professionally made.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast very sharp if they hold up then well worth the money and if they ever go bad they have a warranty</li>
    <li> Much better quality than I expected.  They are very sharp and have a wide opening for thick toe nails.  I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> These do the job nicely. I&#x27;m very happy i bought the set/</li>
    <li> Great clipper, very very sharp !</li>
    <li> These work great ! We haven&#x27;t had any problems with these . my husband has thick toe nails and they work great for him!</li>
    <li> love the design and how sharp they are . no rough nails .. Great on toe nails  The grip is great</li>
    <li> These clippers are wonderful!!I can honestly see them lasting forever!! They are heavy duty and well made. My husband has made them his and i now have to order a second set as he works on a boat and is taking them with him! Thank you so much for a quality product</li>
    <li> These clipper are the best. very heavy and great quality.</li>
    <li> These are super nice! I really like the anti-slip feature that you have, so that your fingers don&#x27;t slide on the clippers when using them. I know that is also a nail file, but works both ways for me. That is genius as I have had that problem using clippers before. Surgical steel too! Great set that comes in it&#x27;s own little storage bag.</li>
    <li> These are the best set of clippers I have come across so far. They are amazing when it comes to not struggling to clip.</li>
    <li> Nail clippers work as advertized. Very sharp compared to what I was using. Well worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> Work great for me. Very study, nice design. Husband has thick nails and it works like a charm for him. Very happy</li>
    <li> These are awesome nail clippers.  They actually have their own little zip lock case to store them so you don&#x27;t have to use a plastic bag.  They are very sharp (read cut thick nails more easily) and have great grip.  I will be ordering another pair!&lt;br /&gt;Goodness, I didn&#x27;t notice the build in filing surface on the bottom of each handle.  Now, they are more awesome than they were before!</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. The price might seem a little to much, but after spending way more than what I&#x27;ve paid on other clippers I made the right choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lifetime warranty from Harperton is a plus.</li>
    <li> The best flippers I have ever purchased. Cuts easily and informally with little pressure needed. Wish I had these all along! Great product design.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new nail clipper after my cheaply bought clipper literally split in half in my attempt to clip my big toe&#x27;s nail. Not wanting to repeat the same incident, I decided to shop for a better clipper, and I came across Klipit. It receives consistently high reviews, looks extremely sturdy, and even comes in a pair (small one for fingernails and big one for toe nails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the clippers arrived I couldn&#x27;t be happier. First of all, they look, in Jony Ive&#x27;s words, &amp;#34;absolutely gorgeous.&amp;#34; They have beautifully finished brushed aluminum with the golden emblem on top of the lever, and padding under the lever, where you rest your finger to perform the clipping. They are sturdy but not bulky. The clippers are at least twice the thickness of a typical big box store&#x27;s clipper, yet they feel natural in your hand. Clipping is nice and easy. The nails are cut nice and clean without a fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to think all clippers are created equal. Obviously, I was wrong. I can&#x27;t recommend these clippers enough. In other words, you REALLY should get them!!!</li>
    <li> These are great, high quality and very sharp.  Service and follow-up has been great, so both product and service have exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my new clippers.  The Klipit feel very secure in my hand.  I&#x27;m not afraid of them slipping and injuring my toe.  I recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect, they are nail clippers after all. But I must say I am impressed! They are strong, sleek and well balanced , you don&#x27;t have to use two hands to squeeze and clip your toenails. The clippers make clean clips that don&#x27;t leave jagged edges.</li>
    <li> I used my Klipit nail clippers immediately after receiving them this past week and am very pleased with them so far.  The cutting edges are quite sharp (be warned!) and slice finger and toe nails with only moderate hand pressure.  This is important to me because my nails have thickened, making them difficult to cut, combined with the fact that I have a &amp;#34;lazy&amp;#34; thumb in my right hand and can&#x27;t press down as I once could. The clippers are also large enough that I can grasp them easily enough. They&#x27;re so superior to the pharmacy-bought products scissors I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> The wife and I have been around for several years and let me say these are the best clippers we have ever found.  Stop hunting and get these.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first of the value for price, but . . . they really are quite superb nail clippers.  So, yeah.</li>
    <li> Very well manufactured, a huge step up from the dime store model.</li>
    <li> Certainly you can find cheaper clippers, but it&#x27;s no bargain if they are worthless. These are sturdy and have very well aligned and sharp blades and cut through even thick nails with no effort at all.</li>
    <li> Great product - sharp and well made.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  Item as described.</li>
    <li> Love the way how these feels, when pressing down on cutting feels it gives me the ease and confidence that it will have a clean cut. must have item.</li>
    <li> Super sharp and precise nail clippers. These are the best! Also good for grip.</li>
    <li> Amazing construction, best nail clippers I have ever owned</li>
    <li> The clippers are well made and work well. They are a big improvement over the cheaply made ones they replaced. Work great on my tough nails.</li>
    <li> I bought these Klipit nail clippers because my old clippers frequently tore or cracked my nails instead of making a clean cut.  The Harperton Klipit clippers are very high quality, strong, precision made, and very sharp.  They make clean and even cuts with no no tearing or cracking.  They are made from heavy stainless steel and are very durable with precisely aligned cutting edges that stay aligned for a precise cut, and are very comfortable and easy to use.  The two sizes makes it easy to trim small nails and large nails.  The large clipper easily cuts through large and thick nails like my big toe, while the small clipper is convenient for small nails like my pinky finger.  A metal nail file with an emory board style filing surface is conveniently built into each clipper that makes touch up filing easy and quick (make sure to remove the blue protective plastic film over the file surface before using).  I am extremely pleased with these clippers and highly recommended them as the best nail clippers that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I recently bought a one-handed nail clipper, as I am a recent amputee.  it consists of a platform with suction cups for afixing to a counter top surface and a standard nail clipper mounted to the platform.  only problem was the nail clipper that came with it was cheap and not useful for someone with one hand.  then I found these very well crafted Klipit clippers.  I removed the cheap ones and mounted the Klipit ones to the platform.  what a difference.  they cut cleanly and with much less effort.  and so affordable for the quality.  well worth the price, whether you have one hand or two.</li>
    <li> Klipit Nail clippers  have a classy look and feel. I like the design on the face of the clippers and that they are stainless steel, lightweight and sharp!&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself to a pair you will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased truly *sharp* nail/toenail clippers before.  It is like night and day....seriously.  I mean, how much of a difference can there be?  Well, at some point I was shredding my nails instead of clipping them.  If you like to keep your nails short and clip often, it makes a mundane task enjoyable.  A customer for life.</li>
    <li> I am giving these two stars because they open no wider then a much cheaper set. Nice clippers for fingernails only, but I find them unacceptable for toenails, unless you have thin toenails.</li>
    <li> Clippers feel solid and perform well. Great packaging and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Great product. I like the style  and they cut very well too. Nice design.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great. Nothing too special about them other than they are sturdy, super sharp and cut cleanly across the blades. Other clippers I have owned have usually had one side that was sharper than the other but these are perfect all the way through.</li>
    <li> I was tired of the standard pharmacy store bought nail clippers that would cut ok a few times and then get dull. I searched a lot of reviews before I decided to buy these and have been very happy. They are good quality and very easy to cut nails. I&#x27;ve had some toenail clippers that almost needed a vice grip to squeeze the clippers to cut but these clippers need very little pressure to cut nails and they are very sharp. I am very happy with these clippers!</li>
    <li> At first I thought that these were basic nail clippers. Was I wrong. These are sharply made, if you cut your nails their cut, you dont really have to worry about when you cut your nails it cuts improperly, I am very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> RUIN  after 3 uses metal is designed to scratch  itself</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers I have ever used.  I was so surprised when I unwrapped them at how sharp they are and how little pressure they require to clip my nails.  I am very pleased with the clippers and have already recommended them to a friend.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how well these clippers work.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Arrived very promptly and both are great pairs of clippers, in particular the ones for toenails. Much better than my previous clippers</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheap clippers. These are well worth it. They work great for thicker toenails.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom. She&#x27;s a senior and it&#x27;s hard for her to cut her toenails because they are very hard. She loved the clipper set. It was very sharp and easy for her to use. I also tried them on my nails and loved them. Very well made. High quality. They will last forever. I would highly recommend them. They come in a very convenient package to keep them together and easier to find.</li>
    <li> After purchasing too many nail clippers that didn&#x27;t work well, figured I&#x27;d try out the expensive set... good choice! Well made, quick ship, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I would give more stars if I could.  I have never used or for that matter seen nail clippers of this quality.  The sharpness makes trimming my nails super quick and easy.  Where they are heavy duty there is no bending of the arm when trimming thick nails.  After using these I will NEVER buy any other type of nail clippers. These are a must buy!</li>
    <li> They work very well.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying using this set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nails clip of with the slightest bit of pressure. They&#x27;re ergonomic, so they don&#x27;t slip out of my hand like certain other clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re priced well, and with a lifetime warranty you can&#x27;t really go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I certainly recommend buying these.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a heavy duty nail clipper that was sharp and accurate - most are so flimsy.  These work!</li>
    <li> Great clipper set. Heavy weight and very sharp. i would buy this set again.</li>
    <li> These are by far, the best nail clippers I have ever encountered. Harperton sent me a sample of this product to review, and this is absolutely my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of points that put these nail clippers at the top of my list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) They are very well made, using heavier metals. Why is this important? It&#x27;s easy to be precise with a slightly heavier tool.&lt;br /&gt;2) The mechanism is by far the sturdiest I have encountered. This means that if you have thicker nails, you&#x27;re not going to hurt yourself. By having a strong mechanism, you&#x27;re not going to worry about not cutting through the nail and having to put too much force. It&#x27;s sort of like the whole &amp;#34;sharper kitchen knives &#x3D; less cuts&amp;#34; principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, these are the most well-made nail clippers I have used to date. They cut through nails without too much force, meaning no split or half-cut nails. The variety you receive is nice, meaning you can use the right size for the right nail. They yellow plastic sleeve they came is was a nice touch, although it broke pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, definitely recommended. I won&#x27;t be buying nail clippers for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Best Clippers I have ever used. Great grip and easy to clip.... Priciest ones I have ever used though. But well worth it if they last years.</li>
    <li> These clippers are Awesome! Very sharp and a lot easier to use than standard nail clippers. I am missing 3 fingers on one hand and these are so much better to use because of the unique design of the levers. Well worth the price!!</li>
    <li> these worked amazing for my mother. she has diabetes and very long and hard toenails. reg toenails will not work for her and if u do u have a use strength. with these no strength is needed and works great with hard toenails. my mother loves them and uses them all the time. I am sure any of you will love them too.</li>
    <li> I received this nail clipper set and I really love it.  It arrived timely and it comes in a nice pouch. Unfortunately I have thick toenails, have since a young age, and these clippers are nice and sharp and easy to maneuver and hold on to.  Cuts right through the thickest.  I know that sounds gross but a fact of life.  Keep away from children as they are that sharp.</li>
    <li> These clippers are pricey but seem to be excellent quality, something I&#x27;ve missed in my last several (cheap) sets that I bought in the store. They&#x27;re also a bit larger and easier to hold while using. After getting tired of the cheap, poor quality sets, these have been worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this nail clipper set.  The matte finish is nice and the blades are sharp.  I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> The quality of these clippers was just better than I would have ever dreamed. They were both really sharp but the part I liked best was the stainless steel handles didn&#x27;t slip out of my large hands. I should have bought a set of these years ago!</li>
    <li> This is a high-quality, professional-grade nail clipper. I was reticent to order because I&#x27;d be paying for two clippers, and I thought I only needed one. I figured I&#x27;d just give one to my husband. I decided to &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34;, and am happy I did.  The two sizes complement each other when doing hands and feet (I am keeping both for myself).  They have a very good &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; - solid, easy to work with.  What I didn&#x27;t expect is that they actually LOOK nice!  Honestly...  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying that about nail clippers!  But it&#x27;s true. The matte satin finish, and the gold-toned detail (not at all cheesy looking)  give these a luxury look and feel.  Even the packaging is nice - there&#x27;s a little pouch for storing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The printed material makes it clear that Harperton intends to distinguish themselves in the personal care products category.  Based on my initial experience with this product, I intend to watch for future products. I am happy to pay for quality that will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I can think of (not a &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; for me, but might be for others who expect this) is that they do not have the ubiquitous ineffective little nail file that the mass-market clippers have. I actually liked that - kind of made a statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> These fingernail and toenail clippers are the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  They are sharp and make clean and effortless cuts.  They are substantially constructed and not flimsy at all.  The curve of both clippers are perfect for my nails. The arrived in short order in a plastic ziplock storage pouch.</li>
    <li> They shipped quickly and arrived ahead of Amazon&#x27;s estimate. They feel very sturdy and well-made. They look nice and come in a neat little zip bag, too. I used the fingernail trimmers this morning after I showered and they cut cleanly and easily. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  Like many I was somewhat leery of the price but was just fed up with alternatives purchased at a local retailer that just did not have a sharp enough blade or sufficient leverage to do the job - especially toe nails.  I was absolutely amazed when I used the set the first time.  I formerly had to get a pedicure at $25 a trip to get acceptable results on my toes.  No more - with the Klipit I am able to get the trim I want and then a swipe or two with a file and I just saved nearly the cost the first time used.  And a whole lot of time as well.  And the smaller fingernail clipper is just the right size to provide a perfect cut the first time.  Thanks Klipit for a great solution for a regular routine maintenance need.  Enthusiastically recommended.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Got tired of trying to use department store sets, so I decided to spend few extra dollars. I&#x27;ve got a couple nails that can be difficult, these clippers don&#x27;t care. They get the job done.</li>
    <li> nice and easy, so sharp and it is the one I have been looking for!</li>
    <li> Blades are sharp and work really well.</li>
    <li> I was offered this item for my review at a disounted price the clipper are very safe and the clip well most clipper when i clip my big toenail the would break in to pieces cause i got tough nails. But these held up really well and I hope that They last a very long time. The are what i have been looking for so they get a thumbs up from me great product you have here.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought they would be. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Finally a nail cutter that works great!  All the others would not cut through my thick nails.</li>
    <li> Good, heavy duty clippers.  Solid, heavy feel and work great.</li>
    <li> Love my klipit set &amp; the little pouch that came with them. I will be keeping this set for myself instead of sharing with the Fam &amp; having them get lost etc. 😊👍👍</li>
    <li> Set for both finger and toenails are as sharp as advertised.  Shipping was rapid and packing was excellent.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great; not at all like the junky ones you often see in drug stores.  They are easy to use, are very sharp, and just do a terrific job!  I am so glad I discovered them.</li>
    <li> I got these for my brother who needed good toe nail clippers because his toe nails are so thick. I picked out these because they seemed to have good ratings and he loves them! It&#x27;s nice that there are two sizes. They are sturdy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great construction, easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t leave jagged edges like the kind I&#x27;ve bought at the checkout counter.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the Klipit.  So sharp it makes trimming nails very easy, takes much less pressure than my old clippers.</li>
    <li> Great clipper! It cuts nice &amp; straight with hardly any effort at all! I like that you get 2 clippers plus a case. So much easier to find when they&#x27;re in the case.</li>
    <li> I luv these nail clippers! They are so sturdy and definitely not cheap made. Cut my nails without any difficulties.</li>
    <li> What a great purchase. I love these clippers! They are sharp and very high quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am very pleased with my purchase. Shipment arrived as scheduled.</li>
    <li> I just reviewed these and tried them out for the first time. They are great. Fantastic craftsmanship, true cut, and stylish. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great set, great quality.... just needs a filer attachment and it would be five stars</li>
    <li> Powerful steel, very sharp. They have a very nice nail file on the inside upper bar. I had no problem clipping my toenails with these. They feel like they&#x27;re going to last quite a while. I can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about them.</li>
    <li> Wow this set is nothing like I woul have thought that a nail and toenail clipper set could be. The clipper items are weighty but with a balance that doesn&#x27;t cause you to tire from using them. The design is quite clever for it creates the proper balance in your hand allowing you to do a more precise job of nail clipping. I never thought that I  would ever be impressed by nail clippers, but I am and you will be too once you try this set. For the quality that you get, it is well worth the price💵.</li>
    <li> Very nice set of nail clippers!  This set is sturdy, very sharp, and strong.  the leverage is great, and you can really get through those tough nails with ease.  They rotate right back where they need to go without sticking, and stay put when in use and when closed.&lt;br /&gt;They clean really easily, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look really nice, too.  If you are a nail professional, this is a good option.  The design gives a little edge.  I get my nails and toes done all the time and we customers really do notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you were to buy these, you&#x27;d be happy with them.  They are built well, and they look nice.  From the looks of them, they will provide you with many years of good service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> these clippers are outstanding. blades are really sharp and trim cleanly. very well built and functional. will buy another set for both bathrooms. would recommend these to everyone looking for a great set of clippers, well worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> Very quick service.  Well packaged and good product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> First of all, the clippers are very good and most importantly, they are easy to hold/grip due to the  &amp;#34;offset&amp;#34; designed into the end of the clipper handle. Very few clippers have this, and it&#x27;s one of those small things that makes a big difference in the comfort/handling.  Precise cut, high-end look and feel, with great handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, Zoey provided the best customer service I have ever experienced in all my on-line purchasing... and I am not that easy to please from a customer service standpoint!  I am very pleased.  Thanks again,  Zoey.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It was not clear that the &amp;#34;mouth&amp;#34; of the clipper was not larger than usual.  We will have to looking for another.  I gave it a 2 rather than a 1 because it is stronger than many.&amp;#34;  I had sent in this review and heard back from the company.  They were very concerned and sent us two other clippers to try.  One of the clippers was WONDERFUL in cutting my husbands broad thick nails and like the other three, the steel was sharp and strong.  This last pair of clippers and the company&#x27;s concern definitely deserve a five star.</li>
    <li> Great clippers!  Clipped thick big toe nail with no trouble.  My old clippers would bend before clipping, not these they are very sturdy.  I even clipped my acrylic nails with ease!  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Better than I initially thought. They are well made and have good handling. The 2 sizes accommodate very well. The pouch is nice and keeps both clippers in place if you decide to travel with them.</li>
    <li> Excellent and sturdy metal. The clipping blades are rather thick. So, it is not easy to get under thin finger nails and toe nails. I tried to help my mother clip her toe nails and it was not easy. The clipper could have been designed to hold the clipping inside and not fly in all directions.</li>
    <li> The Klipit Nail Clippers are great!  I had always used nail scissors, because I thought clippers would be more difficult to use.  It had become too difficult for me to continue using scissors, because I have some nails which have become too thick to easily cut.  I was so happy to find that the Klipit clippers are very easy to use, and cut thick nails so easily.  They seem to be of very high quality, and I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Extremely sharp, and the laser cut (I assume) nail files are super effective.</li>
    <li> About 15 years ago, I purchased my first set of really good clippers from Brookstone&#x27;s for $29.  It was one clipper equivalent to the small one in this set.  Gave me good service but finally broke when trying to cut a particularly tough toe nail.  These arrived and the large one made quick work of the toe nail and the small one works as well, if not better, than the $29 Brookstone unit.  First rate product at a great price.  Buy them....you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> These clippers are absolutely the best I have ever used. The smoothness of the cut nails is really perfect.</li>
    <li> As the blades are very sharp, Klipit does a very good job and as designed it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> these are the best clippers i ever had.  they came on time.  they cut through my thick toenails.  very well built</li>
    <li> Good looking product, comes in a nice reusable case, feels like the clippers are built to last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried over a dozen brands of nail clippers, including Seki/Tweezerman/Victorinox, and these are as good as any of them. Don&#x27;t expect anything revolutionary here; they are shaped like your standard nail clippers. The innovation is in the very sturdy top lever, which makes your compression much more likely to result in a clean cut, rather than a tear. I&#x27;ve had clippers whose levers were so weak they&#x27;d bend before cutting my nails, which would often leave me with an ugly nail. Not these. For the elderly, disabled, and young, if have weak hands that can&#x27;t grip tightly, I think these would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Clean cuts every time.&lt;br /&gt;-Sturdy lever; no bending and doesn&#x27;t require a great deal of force to cut.&lt;br /&gt;-Comfortable ergonomic shape to the lever, so you don&#x27;t dig your hands into the edges.&lt;br /&gt;-The file is actually quite good, though it&#x27;s centered away from the edge. I don&#x27;t use it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;-Holes, in case you want to hang them or add them to a keychain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None. If you want a special design that has an angled cutting surface or a revolutionary mechanism, look elsewhere, but these are very sturdy classic clippers.</li>
    <li> I had read all the previous posts about these nail clippers and were sold. I placed the order and had this in my hand super fast. I am pleased with the product so far and am super happy with the customer service that I have received. I give 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Historically, I have hated clipping my nails. I would struggle using dollar store clippers that would leave jagged edges, crack my nails, or require far too much pressure to use. These clippers have dawned a new age in my everlasting nail clipping endeavor. While clipping nails is still not my passion, it is now entirely tolerable! Gone is the excruciating weekly chore, now it is simply palatable. I think many people would agree that this shift is miraculous given the nature of the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the product itself. The clippers feel sturdy in the hand and seem to be well built. I&#x27;ve only used them twice but I expect them to take a beating for a long time to come. The handle is curved nicely to hold and provides nice leverage. Two sizes are included, the small is perfect for my fingers and my smallest two toes, and the larger one actually clips my big toe! A nice yellow ziplock is also included to house the clippers between uses. Build quality is definitely sufficient with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, functionality. These babies definitely function. As you can infer from my passionate nail clippee review, I like these. No, I love these. No, love does not begin to describe my feeling. Seriously though, these far exceed the capabilities of my past clippers. They fit around my nail better, they reach corners better, and most importantly, they actually clip. I have done two full rounds of my hands amd toes with these so far, and each cut has been perfectly clean, perfectly. Emphasis on perfectly, and clean... and cut I guess. In the past, my nails would always tear or I would have to use a dangerous amount of pressure. I have relatively large man feet with relatively thick man nails, and these work like a charm. No complaints here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend this product? Well, if a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? Wait, bad example, no one knows. Anyway, what I&#x27;m trying to get at is, yes, I do recommend this product for any intelligent primates that grow nails, humans included. Do your keratin a favor, and let them go gently. There is no longer a place for violence in my nail clipping routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now is when you can feel free to press &amp;#34;add to cart&amp;#34;, you will thank yourself later.this product for any intelligent primates that grow nails, humans included.

    <li> I just clipped my nails with my new Harperton Clippers and for the first time EVER, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to file afterward. My nails feel so smooth! What quality!!!</li>
    <li> Unkempt finger/toenails are one of my biggest pet peeves. You might say that nail clippers are to me as chapstick is to Michael Vick. I keep/hide a backup pair of clippers in all places that I frequent...every vehicle, travel bag, relative&#x27;s home, etc. As such, I&#x27;ve accumulated (and lost) a lot of generic clippers over the years. Some are surprisingly sharp and effective, but most are only marginally better than a pair of needle-nose pliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers from Harperton are very well-made and really crisp and sharp. They come in a small, yellow, zippered, PVC bag/pouch which is pretty handy, along with a small brochure advertising their lifetime warranty and some other promotional freebies and discounts from Harperton. I don&#x27;t have very large nails, so the larger pair of clippers are more of a bonus backup for me, but I imagine they&#x27;ll be great for those that need the extra leverage for their big, super hard, disgusting toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would review nail clippers, but the quality of these clippers is worth noting.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re sturdy, sharp and cut well.  They seem like they will last a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always pretty much torn off my nails with cheap nail clippers, so investing in a durable and sharp pair is worth it in my opinion! This set is super sturdy feeling, and they actually clip my nails. They come with a pretty nice nail file on the inside of each lever and the set includes a cute storage bag as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Clips so smoothly.</li>
    <li> Much easier to use and cleaner cut than more expensive brand name clippers that I&#x27;ve used.  Great value!</li>
    <li> First and foremost, these are clippers, and they do clip! Unlike any other clippers I&#x27;ve used, though, these ones feel like they are put together like a machine. Everything fits nicely and moves smoothly. They come in a small yellow ziplock-style pouch that makes it possible to find them in the bathroom drawer that is overflowing with everything else we keep in there. I&#x27;m an engineer and I enjoy tools. These clippers are tools, not junk.</li>
    <li> Sturdy precise construction, well thought design, lifetime warranty,  what&#x27;s not to like?  I&#x27;ve seen sets at the discount stores for the same price that I wouldn&#x27;t buy because they looked cheap.  I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I am a bit of a fanatic when it comes to keeping my nails short but well manicured and these clippers do the trick. OK, creating a good nail clipper should not be rocket science but I have bought a lot of manicure sets over the years and these clippers are by far the best I have ever had. Very ergonomic and a delight to use.</li>
    <li> I have uses the Harperton nail clippers since I received them, and found them to be  far superior to any I  have ever used before.  They are extremely sharp, ergonomically designed to fit well in the hand without being hard on your thumb, and very attractive.  I have no doubt that the material they are made of (it looks like brushed stainless steel) will be durable for many years.  I am only sorry I did not find them earlier.  Thanks, Harperton!</li>
    <li> I received my Nail Clippers today and I was VERY Impressed! They were so sturdy and cut right through the nail, it wasn&#x27;t hard to push to cut and they were very sharp, which I was impressed and loved. There is a little nail file on top of it which is another plus for this. I will definetly be getting another set!</li>
    <li> Great clippers and warranty. They make you feel like it&#x27;s something more important than just a pair of nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Extraordinarily sharp and can cut through thick nails</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are awesome. I tend to get some pretty tough nails, but they are no match for the Klipit clipper set. Easy to use and sturdy too. Feels like a high-quality product when you are using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have this kind of nail cutter. These kind are usually long lasting and very durable. My friend recommended this to me and I loved it the moment I receive it. A must have for your personal stuff...</li>
    <li> Just received my new clippers and am really excited about them.  They seem very sturdy and durable which is good since the small ones will be on my keys and probably get the most use.  Only just tried them out so far but the cut seems to be very clean.  And you may not need a file as advertised but both clippers have one built in on the underside of the handle which I did not even know about.  I went back and looked through the description and still don&#x27;t see anything about the files in there.  But you can see it in the last pic they have and I&#x27;ve included one too.  Also they have a very attractive brushed nickel looking finish.  It&#x27;s crazy to be so excited about something that seems so small but I feel like this was money well spent.</li>
    <li> Wow! These are professional clippers.  We&#x27;ve been looking for a really great set and these are the ones.  I will order more sets and replace some of the sorry ones I already own.</li>
    <li> Everything as expected.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was having trouble with my nail clippers becoming dull quickly. I did some research and these seemed to be the best. Upon receipt, I was pleasantly surprised at how sharp they were and how ergonomical the design was. I was also impressed with the weight of them, as they were not heavy, but did not feel cheap like other sets I have had in the past.</li>
    <li> I ordered a couple nail clipper sets and had others before, and I must say that the Klipit set seems to be made to a higher quality than all others I have used. As the product packaging states, these nail clippers are made with attention to detail.  Crafted from high quality stainless steel, the operation is easy...clipping nails with ease and to a sharp, crisp edge that appears will last for a very long time.  I have had other clippers that have lasted for years (several years)...but this set seems like it would last a lifetime.  Also appreciate the personal note from the company president on the product package...that they are trying to produce a superior product for the benefit of all.</li>
    <li> As we age, the strength in our hands weakens, and it is more difficult to grasp certain items.  These nail clippers work great; easy to grasp and strong enough to clip thick toe nails.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are awesome clippers. I have always refused to use &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; cheap nail clippers because they take too much effort, leave jagged edges, or just plain don&#x27;t cut. For years I used VERY expensive clippers from a knife company in Germany. One set got old and fell apart so I shopped around for a new set - hoping not to break the bank again. I found these clippers and they are wonderful. They are sharp but they feel very comfortable in your hand and are very easy to use - two VERY important factors when using sharp clippers. The entire family loves them!</li>
    <li> Finally an implement that easily works in clipping thick nails.  Would highly recommend for anyone with this issue.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a sturdy pair of nail clippers to use on both my hands and feet.  I had been very frustrated with searches and purchases to date.  Even the clippers highly touted by Amazon&#x27;s own recommendations come with a lot of mixed reviews.  Finally I tried a search for German made clippers and found these.&lt;br /&gt;I have problem toenails that grow very thick and tough.  I have tried many types of nail clippers, but just could not find a pair that would do the job and do it without leaving rough edges.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two sets (one for me and one for the wife) of these nail clippers based on the reviews.  The nail clippers have exceeded my expectations even based on the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;They easily fit over and clip my thickest nails and leave nice smooth edges.  The feel sturdy and substantial in your hands.  They easily work around the nail and have so far been the best clippers I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Sharp and works great.</li>
    <li> The Best!! Just perfect!!</li>
    <li> Bought this nail clipper set for my 14 yr old son and he really likes it (much better than the clipper set he had).  Worth every penny to see him finally taking care of those toenails!!</li>
    <li> Been using these for over a month and love them. They are exceedingly sharp (really rare with these things) and the shape of the lever is perfect. Unlike others which cause your thumb to slip and slide while you&#x27;re trying to apply pressure (since there is nothing for your thumb or finger to grip) these levers are sharply indented and ridged which completely prevent slippage. Wish I&#x27;d known about these 50 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality, perfectly engineered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used nail clippers like these before. They are the king of nail clippers. Heavy duty! Barely any pressure to use and you have clipped! I love them! Nice and sharp too!</li>
    <li> The clipper is very well made. It looks like a lot of time was spent designing it. Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the nail clipper that I have been looking for!  It very precisely and cuts my nails easily.  Won&#x27;t have an hassle again.  Customer service was excellent, and I received my product in a timely matter.</li>
    <li> Compared to scissors, the clippers greatly reduce the possibility of tearing. Since cutting an entire nail takes several clips, a bit of care is needed to avoid unevenness between individual cuts. The maximum opening of both clippers is ~2mm. That&#x27;s not sufficient for one of my toe nails (presumably the &amp;#34;fault&amp;#34; of my nail, but I still need a way to &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; it ...).</li>
    <li> Overall great product.</li>
    <li> These are really great.. They are really pretty and are very sharp.. I love how two come in a pack..</li>
    <li> I ordered this set when my old set failed. I was looking for a quality set and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The craftsmanship and machining are superb. The set comes with a nice carrying case that closes. They are ultra sharp and seem to be made of high grade stainless steel.</li>
    <li> They are the best cutting clippers I have ever used but I would not call the larger pair toenail clippers. They have the same curve as the fingernail clippers and I expect toenail clippers to be straight.</li>
    <li> one star less as it was too loud which is a big deal for me. otherwise works well.</li>
    <li> product as described, Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been around a while (72 years) and this nail clipper set is the first I have encountered that remains effective as they are used; don&#x27;t get dull and require more and more pressure to cut efficiently. I appreciate the workmanship.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good! The metal finish is nice and matte... well weighted. I like the option of using the different sizes. The price is high but you can get a free second pair if your register with them. A minor complaint is one of mine came with the finish chipped. not a big deal though.</li>
    <li> I got these today and I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of them! They&#x27;re beautiful and work fantastic!</li>
    <li> The product is really, really precise and sharp.  Be patient lining things up but it is the cleanest, sharpest cut you will make.  Why didn&#x27;t I buy this ten years ago?</li>
    <li> Rarely do you find a company and a product that over delivers. You can tell the quality when they hit your hand! These clippers cut clean and the action is smooth. The value is incredible. Glad I took a chance on these guys!</li>
    <li> This is a great set of clippers to own. Not only are they very sharp, but their heft in your hand is substantial. Because they have a nice weight to them, it is easier to hold them in place in your hand. Also, having psoriatic arthritis means having thicker than normal nails. These clippers perform perfectly.</li>
    <li> Clippers feel heavy duty in the hand but I wish they were a little sharper.</li>
    <li> These are a great set of nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I thought about purchasing a single nail clipper for around the same amount of money but decided to purchase these instead. After using them I have to say, for such a simple and not so glamorous product it really shines. You can tell the metal is of good quality and they very much feel like a quality knife. Also, like a quality knife they cut very well. The clipper handle, where you rest your finger to push down is very comfortable to hold onto. A file is included on the nail clippers and they feel like they could file down metal as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great set of nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Works great. overpriced.</li>
    <li> I never knew what a good pair of nail clippers was until I bought these.  When I needed a replacement this time around, I had a hard time finding any in the stores that had a hole for slipping them on my key ring.  I found some in Walmart, but they were the worst of the cheapo nail clippers ever.  Then I saw the Klipit set on Amazon.  As you feel the heft of the steel in your hand, the clippers proudly wear the brand logo inset in the substantial, sculpted lever.  The sharp precision-ground edges are impressive.  I love the diamond grit file built into the inside of the lever.  That was a bonus feature not even described on the Amazon page!  I never thought I would spend $24.00 on a set of clippers.  Frustration drove me to it, but these are so worth it.  I can proudly let them swing on my key fob an show them off!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCTS. They are professionally designed and built to last. I had hand surgery and using the standard clippers I could not cut my nails. These, no problems.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I bought a pair of clippers. They usually just magically appear in random drawers that my wife or kids point me to when I ask for them. The problem with most clippers found in the wild (random drawers), they are dull, cheap, and overall do more harm than good. So I finally decided to go to Amazon and see what I could find.&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Klipit! I&#x27;ll never go back to cheap, crappy super market clippers again. Sure these might be a little more money, but the second I took them out of the package I could feel the difference. Great build quality and sharp. This may sound stupid, but I was actually a little disappointed when I was done clipping my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be asking yourself, what is this guy on or how sad is his life that he gets this much enjoyment from a pair of clippers? Fair questions for sure, but these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used, so...deal with it?</li>
    <li> I have had these clippers for 2 weeks. I have tried many many clippers over the years and I am usually disappointed with them.  I am not disappointed with these clippers.  They are among the best I have found.  They are excellent quality and most importantly they cut nicely. The cuts are smooth and don&#x27;t leave any jagged edges.  The file integrated into the handle is a very nice touch and again it is excellent quality. I have no hesitation recommending these.  I have tried other, more expensive clippers, and these are as good or better than any of them.</li>
    <li> A great set of nail clippers. Well constructed, with very sharp blades and smooth mechanics.  I engage in activities that result in broken and dirty nail edges. The clippers&#x27; strength, curve and sharpness make it fast and easy to keep my nails short (and clean) and smoothly rounded.</li>
    <li> This is the best set of clippers hands down. Was looking for a really solid and sharp clipper that would cut my nails nice and clean without having to file, these do the trick! I used them first time without soaking my hands in warm water and it cut nice and smooth without having to file afterwards for once! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> After first opening the package it was easy to see the difference in quality between this set and the kind of sets you would purchase in your local store. The build quality is heftier and the clippers are sharp. These cut nails better than any other brand I have purchased in the past. For me this is an item where you get what you pay for. I was expecting good clippers, but these far exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great clippers - well made, easy to grip and use.  They seem very durable.  Nice!</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever had!  Very well designed.  They cut very neat and clean.  Don&#x27;t even use a nail file afterwards unless there are sharp edges on the sides of nails.  I&#x27;d buy these again if I need to (but would only need to if I loose them!)  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great clippers.  The seem really durable and are quality made.  The cutting surface is sharp and makes quick work of nails.  They handle nicely too.  Great set.</li>
    <li> FINALLY, a great set of clippers. Now I don&#x27;t have to listen to my wife complain every time she cuts her nails. These are well worth the money, I have spent way more on the ones that are supposed to be good only to throw them away after a few uses. You can see that these are made from high quality material ( Stainless Steel )</li>
    <li> IT IS EVERYTHING THEY SAID IT WOULD BE.</li>
    <li> The absolute best nail clippers I have ever used!  They are very strong and very sharp.  You get a nice smooth edge not after the cut instead of the rough jagged edge from most clippers, I do not plan to probably ever have to buy again for myself, but will definitely buy these as gifts!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used cheap drug store nail clippers. I didn&#x27;t realize how much a good pair of nail clippers would make. The Klipit nail clippers immediately feel much more substantial and sturdy. I was amazed at the ease of clipping my nails, I have very thick finger nails that always need to be filed after a clipping as they&#x27;re very sharp and uneven. I don&#x27;t need to do much filing anymore as my nails are no longer sharp and uneven after clipping. If I need to do a little touch up filing, these clippers have built in emery material on the backside of the levers. What a great set of clippers!</li>
    <li> Great clippers! Small rough rectangle on handle helps to keep a grip on the clipper - especially when wet. I have never seen a clipper with this feature.</li>
    <li> Clippers work great and feel quite heavy duty. Big upgrade from the run of the mill cheap nail clippers.</li>
    <li> The razor-sharp edge on these solid, well-crafted clippers makes all the difference!  I dislike using files (handling sandpaper/similar textures bother me to no end), and these cut cleanly enough that filing isn&#x27;t really necessary.  You won&#x27;t be sorry for investing in this set.</li>
    <li> A great set of clippers, they&#x27;re heavy and durable with smooth action. The rounded blades actually match my fingers very well so it&#x27;s easy to trim even the edges of the nail. They&#x27;re a little expensive compared to the drugstore set but I&#x27;m very happy to have better tools that make the job easier!</li>
    <li> These clippers are amazing. They are very well made and  sharp. I have been looking for a really good set of clippers for a long time and my search is finally over. Thanks Klipit for an outstanding product everyone who sees them wants a pair.</li>
    <li> sharp, functional, well priced.</li>
    <li> Great clippers.  Just what I was looking for.  Fantastic customer service as well.</li>
    <li> What a great pair of nail clippers.I have others at home but have trouble using them as they are too small to use on my toes and too small to hold comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;These are very attractive in the brushed stainless steel finish. They are larger than others I have, very comfortable to hold at any angle, well balanced which makes it very comfortable to use. I have arthritis in my hands and as I am older (72) my nails are thicker than they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;I can press down on the lever with very little pressure and it makes a very clean cut wit no fraying. 1 light press is all it needs. Great for my hands also is the length of the larger clipper. I can hold it comfortably to reach all my toenails.  I am keeping these for myself in the porch it came in, the color is easy to see and find in my cosmetic draw. I will have to get my husband a pair of his own so we don&#x27;t give one another any foot problem we may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love tools and gadgets and I must say that these are beautifully made.</li>
    <li> Very nice set of Nail Clippers. They come in a cute bag and seem very well made. Definitely not some cheap set that will be rusting or getting tossed. I think they are definitely worth purchasing if you need a good quality pair!!</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about spending this much money on this nail clipper set without seeing them in person.  I have not had the best of luck with the Tweezerman brand, Revlon brand, and other local beauty store brands.  Anyways, I am happy to report that these are one of the best purchases I have made this year.  From the minute you open your set you can see and feel the quality of these clippers.  Even my husband after the first use said &amp;#34;THESE ARE MAGNIFICENT!&amp;#34;....I couldn&#x27;t agree more!  These are absolutely wonderful!  I was starting to think I just had weird nails or something, but these clippers have proven that is not the case.  They cut precisely and without tearing, denting, or cracking your nails.  They also don&#x27;t leave you with a weird edge.  I now have to file very little to if at all after using them.  I like them so much I will be purchasing a set for all of my loved ones for Christmas.  I highly recommend these.  I will be sticking with this brand from now on and will be looking to see if they have any other products.</li>
    <li> These are easily the best nail clippers I have ever bought. They are very well built and are far sturdier then the regular store bought ones I usually would buy. The clippers are very sharp and the nail file is superior in every way compared to the others.</li>
    <li> Amazingly sharp!!! Not those icky ones from wal-Mart!!! Comes with a handy Cary case for your convenience! Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic clippers. Very easy to hold onto. Sharp and very precise. I didn&#x27;t realize how cheap my other clippers were until I used these. I&#x27;m ordering another set to keep in my overnight bag.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Honestly the best set I&#x27;ve spent any kind of money on. As a guy I&#x27;ve used the cheap, terribly made clippers found in traveler kits along with whatever I could find around the house. Do yourself a favor, grow up and get a pair. Well designed and well crafted with quality material, sharp and ergonomic. A great set for home or travel, with this kind of value you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Very nice, well made clippers.  Big bonus to have two sizes.  Arrived promptly, well packaged and in perfect condition</li>
    <li> I am used to your bog standard nail clippers and this set of clippers took me completely by surprise, in a good way, when they arrived and I got a chance to use them.  The clippers are very well built and somehow (maybe by the way it is shaped) made cutting thick nails very easy.  Definitely would recommend these!</li>
    <li> it is good and i try this it amaze your nail can be arrange</li>
    <li> Very high quality, reasonable price (compared to products of similar quality), and Prime shipping. They even look very nice.</li>
    <li> These appear to be the most solidly made nail clippers out there. They feel quite substantial in the hand and seem to use only the highest grade materials. These things look like they will last for years.</li>
    <li> Really sturdy clippers. These came in time cause my old ones fell apart they day these came. I didn&#x27;t realize there was a sticker over the file part. Just need to pull up the sticker.  I just thought they didn&#x27;t have one. Super nice set. They even have a little bag you can keep them in.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever had.  Perfectly sharp and does not &amp;#34;splinter&#x27;&amp;#34; nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fussy on clippers because I have arthritis in my hands so sometimes cutting ones nails can be a trial. These are super! They clip so easy and no ragged edges. Some clippers I&#x27;ve had I honestly could not get the clipper pushed down because of my arthritis. Again, not with these. Very very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with these finger and toenail clippers. I was looking for high quality clippers to replace the cheap drugstore purchased products I had before and am very happy so far. They are very comfortable to hold, easy to use, and do a great job at cutting nails. The emery board on the underside of the handles is a nice touch. The great customer service provided by Harperton employees is an added bonus. Would definitely buy again if and when I need to.</li>
    <li> In the end, they&#x27;re nail clippers and they do their job well.  Their most appealing aspect for me personally is their appearance and expense.  I hate losing things and having to shop for them again, and I&#x27;ve found that I keep better track of my things if I paid a little more for them and if they have a noticeably interesting design.  I particularly like the little gold shield.  Who doesn&#x27;t like allusions to heraldry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only dissatisfaction is that the little storage pocket they shipped with doesn&#x27;t have separate pockets for each clipper to prevent them from scratching each other.</li>
    <li> Great nail clippers with built in nail files.  Easy to hold, excellent size, cut great.. will probably buy another set.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic clippers. They are sharp, have an integrated nail file, and come with a handy carrying case. I particularly like the heft of the clippers, they feel very satisfying in your hand. I looked at many clippers on Amazon, and was weary of so many of the top reviews being by people who received the product for free - I worry about unbiased accounts. These clippers were mostly reviewed by people who had purchased the item themselves and this made me much more comfortable in my purchase. And I feel this paid off. My clippers arrived with a broken travel bag - I told their customer service and they got back to me promptly, apologizing for the mishap and offering to send me a new one. I declined - my clippers always end up in a drawer or medicine cabinet, but I was impressed that they took my casual comment very seriously.</li>
    <li> Great product. Sharp, sturdy and provides great nail clips.</li>
    <li> These clippers are OK but seem a little high in price.  I ordered them anyway because there seems to be no middle of the road models out there at a reasonable price.  They do cut nicely but are a little thick for cutting the nail close.  These clippers have a small insert on the underside of the handle that can be used as a small nail file. They protect it with a plastic film for shipping, I guess.  Anyway, when I took the protective film off the small one, the metal piece came off with it which shows some quality issues with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update;  When the seller read that I had one of my clippers break when I was taking off the protective covering, they contacted me and replaced the set I received at no cost to me and without my asking.  Based on this and the contact I have had with the company, I am convinced that these are good clippers and a great company that cares about its customers.  I have also had more time to use the new clippers and I am very happy with the way they work so I am changing my review to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent build quality, sharp nail clippers.  These clippers have a great feel to them and make clean precise cuts, night and day difference from the cheaper types typically available from the local drug store.  Heavy duty stainless, brushed finish, sharp blades, these are the best clippers I have owned to date.</li>
    <li> Very high quality nail clippers.  We purchased them to replace the drug store nail clippers we always get, wish I had done so a few years ago because they trim nails so wonderfully with ease. They&#x27;re just nail clippers but exponentially superior to any we&#x27;ve used before, great investment!!!</li>
    <li> I really like these nail clippers.  They are solidly built and feel great in your hand.  They cut very well.  Best clippers ever!  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Clipping with these for the first time felt almost as good as being able to toss away my small collection of old, rusty, and cheaply made clippers. These have a wonderful feel to them and operate with exacting precision. Their design is sleek and they even come with a handy translucent yellow bag for storage. They seem to be very well made so don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have cause to need it, but they&#x27;re backed by a lifetime warranty—and it seems like the company would actually stand by this pledge without any hassle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my son who recently left for college.  We are very impressed with the look and feel of the Klipit clipper set and would recommend it to others.  The included carrying case is a nice feature as well.  Pleased with our purchase!</li>
    <li> 2 thumbs up! Well made almost feels custom made. Even has a carrying case!</li>
    <li> The Old Mountain Goat knows when I find something really good - 5 Stars for Klipit!</li>
    <li> Very Solid pair of clippers, they are not flimsy like other clippers, sharp and fits well in the hand.</li>
    <li> The clippers did not appear to be as sharp as people&#x27;s posts.  The clippers give a very clean cut, but it does require more effort than my wife&#x27;s preferred clippers.  I don&#x27;t think they are going to replace my wife&#x27;s clippers as the go-to clippers.  Not sure if they are worth the price.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery.  Was dissapointed, large clipper worked fabulously while the smaller clipper did not clip at all.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> These clippers are very sharp, well designed and ergonomic. I have used them several times and am very impressed with how well they work. Although you will pay a little more, as with every thing else in life, you get what you pay for. I misplaced my favorite clippers and have been searching for a replacement for months. These clippers actually work better than my old favorite ones. I definitely recommend them and am glad I found them.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a quality nail clippers for 10 years(since my last good one broke).  I have purchased dozens with poor results.&lt;br /&gt;These were exactly what I was looking for. They are well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is one more thing that makes life a bit easier. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Very sharp clipper makes it easy to clipp nails</li>
    <li> sturdy.  Nice to have the two sizes for fingers, toes, little toes, etc.</li>
    <li> I love these nail clippers!  They feel very high quality in my hands.  The  clipper arm has extra leverage making it it easier to use then other clippers.  they deliver a easy clean crisp.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service from the company.</li>
    <li> great cutters fast delivery</li>
    <li> Excellent pair of clippers! The clippers themselves are just slightly larger than a normal set but the mouth opening is nice and wide so you don&#x27;t have to struggle with a thickened toe nail. Comes with a cute case as well. And if ever the need arises, this company&#x27;s customer service reps are awesome!</li>
    <li> These work ok not my favorite pair.</li>
    <li> I  like these a lot. Very easy to use even with weak hands.  Sharp and dies good job on thick/hard nails. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 *&#x27;s is I like something to clean under my nails.  Though I prefer a glass file, in a pinch the built in file in good, just do not be like me and take the files blue protective film of first.  It comes with a handy easy to use yellow zip bag to store the clippers in.</li>
    <li> The clippers come in a handy yellow pouch which makes it easy find when you are looking for your clippers.  Clippers are sharp, good size to grip.  Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these nailclippers.  They are extremely durable and heavy duty which if much needed for my other half.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve owned. They are not the cheap metal that doesn&#x27;t cut easily. My husband has those thick toe nails (tmi) and these cut right through them.</li>
    <li> these are not sharp.  the handles too short for any leverage.  disappointed.</li>
    <li> This really a quality product, the best I have ever had! The customer service is fantastic. Worth every penny! Kurt</li>
    <li> These clippers are made from the heaviest gauge metal I have seen for this product type. The fit and finish is unsurpassed.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that if you have highly curved nails the cutting edge gap is to narrow.</li>
    <li> These are very excellent clippers. Very sharp giving a clean cut. My 4th and 5th toe nails have become quite thick previously I had great difficulty cutting them. With these clippers it was a breeze. I was also able to cut my toe nails dry. I previously had to do it right after I got out of the shower when the nails were soft. I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this set. They may have a lot of nice little features as mentioned in other reviews but I wanted clippers that cut well and these are up to the task.</li>
    <li> These are AMAZING! Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever purchased! My Husband has the toughest nails and I have such a hard time cutting them and I was amazed at how effortless it was to cut his toe nails and they even cut my acrylic nails off with such ease. I love how it comes with a built in file so you don&#x27;t have to carry two different products in your purse or drawer! The quality and overall aesthetics of this design are top notch!</li>
    <li> After one use of the clippers, I&#x27;m satisfied with them. They are well designed and feel nice in the hand. They cut more crisply than the previous set that I was using. $20 for a nail clipper set is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for most of the time.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and good for stubborn nails that are thick and hard to clip.</li>
    <li> Fantastic clippers!  They cut cleanly and don&#x27;t leave any ragged edges or anything.  You can tell they are well built, very solid and well machined.  Best nail clippers I have ever bought, and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  I  was tired of cheaply made nail clippers and wanted to make an investment in something that will get more than the job done!  The blades are very sharp!  They hardly require pressure to clip my rigid nails.  The nail clippers are not heavy and have a nice matted feel to them.  It has a rough square piece to sand down the nails.  I will have no doubt that these will last plenty of years and do a great job!</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers initially for a christmas gift--they had the best reviews so I figured with Amazon Prime what do I have to loose?&lt;br /&gt;OH MY GOSH are they worth it--I will never buy another $1.00 pair of clippers again!  Cheap clippers tend to split your nails and the metal &amp;quot;gives&amp;quot; when trying to snip but not these.  Even better they come with two pairs!</li>
    <li> Awesome Clipper set!  Wife already confiscated the smaller one and I kept the larger and the travel pouch!  Great Product and shipping!</li>
    <li> Fantastic weight, feel and packaging.  Very good customer service as well.  Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> I was looking for some good clippers for my husband, these had some good reviews so I purchased them. My husband is very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> I got really tired of flimsy nail clippers. These are precise and built well.</li>
    <li> This product arrived as scheduled and is awesome.  These clippers are very sharp and cut with ease.  I immediately moved my old pairs to the shop to use as wire cutters.  The customer service of this company is great and they followed up with me to make sure i was satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again for sure.</li>
    <li> Great clippers! Very sharp and strong. They do a great job.</li>
    <li> Solidly built.  And with a nice design.  They also come with a nice yellow pouch.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. I was tired of cheaply made nail clippers and wanted to make an investment in something that will get more than the job done! The blades are very sharp! They hardly require pressure to clip my rigid nails. The nail clippers are not heavy and have a nice matted feel to them. It has a rough square piece to sand down the nails. I will have no doubt that these will last plenty of years and do a great job!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these but for a couple times so far, but at first glance, you can easily tell these are well-made clippers. They seem to be nice and sharp and cut even the thickest of nails without a problem. I can see these clippers lasting a VERY long time.</li>
    <li> I just had hand surgery and I was having problems using my current nail clippers. I set out to find a good pair of nail clippers and I started my search on Amazon. I saw some that looked pretty good and I was almost ready to buy those, but then I saw Klipit. I wondered by these cost more money than other models. I read every review and decided to buy Klipit and I could not be happier. They came and I tried them and they work amazingly well. Very simply to use, very well built and they just work. I was very happily surprised how easy they are to use and just how sharp they are. I am going to throw away all of my other ones that don&#x27;t work very well and I am now a fan of Klipit. Buy them you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> These do work as well as advertised.  Definitely the best clippers I have ever had!</li>
    <li> These are simply amazing. Cleanest cut I&#x27;ve ever seen from a nail clipper. Whether your nail is dry or wet, these clippers deliver.</li>
    <li> Well Built and met expectations</li>
    <li> What happened to nail clippers over the years?  I used to be able to get a pretty good product in the grocery store; now even a trip to an upscale beauty supply for clippers ended with a disappointing product.  The Klipit nail clipper set is wonderful.  They’re sturdy, have a nice heft, are very sharp and easy to control.  They have a handy, dandy built-in file positioned in a way that keeps your thumb from slipping off the lever, and the base is curved in such a way that it keeps the rest of the fingers from slipping off the underside.  They’re very well designed and of a very nice material.  The husband is very pleased (and so is the wife)!</li>
    <li> These clippers are very well made. It&#x27;s so easy to cut your fingernails and toenails with them. They are great.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a pair of quality fingernail clippers, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing. These things are great and well worth the money. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent Clipper, it leaves a clean edge</li>
    <li> Emory board us to small to consider . Only tried the clippers once they seem to be fine.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic clippers. They clip really good and they are sharp. Other clippers didnt work as good as these on my fingernails.I have thick nails and these work the best. I am glad I purchased these.</li>
    <li> These clippers are very good quality.  The weight of the clippers is very heavy with leads me to believe they will last a long time.  Plus we love the file it works so well.  However, the best part of these clippers is that when you clip your nails they clip the nail of so cleanly that you will not even need to file the nail afterward.  I not sure I have ever had a clippers that did that before.  I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I received this set of nail clippers for Mother&#x27;s Day.  They look very nice and my husband commented that this is a very useful gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally had a chance to try it out.  I used the toenail clipper and could tell the difference right away.  Due to age and other factor, my toenails have become very thick.  When I go to nail salon, the worker usually needs to pull out special tool to cut my toenails.  Yet with this toe nail clipper I have an easy time cutting the nails.  It is easy to cut a little bit at a time and it is equally easy to cut at an angle.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially those who have thick nails, in particular.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these and customer service is outstanding.</li>
    <li> After using my Klipit clippers for a couple of months I am starting to really dislike them. They are large and rather cumbersome to use. It’s difficult to make a precise cut. And even though the clippers are sharp, every nail clipping shoots across the room like a bullet. You will find clippings in unexpected places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did a mediocre product end up with so many five star reviews? Soon after receiving my clippers I received an email from Factory Standard. They offered to send me a free Klipit set if I posted a review. Free stuff has a way of clouding your objectivity.</li>
    <li> Not a good purchase, not sharp enough.</li>
    <li> Great nail clipper set as described. There is a small nail file on the underside. Overall seems well made.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Solid feel, sharp clippers. Just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have always bitten my nails for years and I obviously wanted to cut that habbit. Luckily, this clipper set helped me do so.&lt;br /&gt;These don&#x27;t tear my nails, they slice them off and in about a week, my nails actually look normal.&lt;br /&gt;The extra ten dollars compared to other clippers are fully warranted.</li>
    <li> Finely, nail clippers are again made like they were made in &amp;#34;YEARS&amp;#34; gone. Thank you, thank you for making them like this once again......</li>
    <li> Excellent set. I&#x27;ve only used them a couple of times so far but construction feels sturdy, everything moves smoothly, and the file under the handle is a nice addition. The yellow case makes them easy to find in the bathroom drawer as well. The only way to improve these would be to add the side covers so nail clippings don&#x27;t go flying!</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d say this about toe nail clippers but these things are spectacular.</li>
    <li> Excellent as I expected</li>
    <li> Ordered the klipit nail clipper kit and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed they are great quality and shipped fast. Great coustomer service as well.</li>
    <li> High Quality clipper set. very sturdy and worth the purchase..</li>
    <li> My husband really likes these clippers.  They are sharp and easy to use.  The only thing they could use is a way to hold the clippings in after cutting so they would be easy to dispose of.</li>
    <li> Very good nailclippers, on par with my Seki set</li>
    <li> These clippers are great. Nice and sturdy and sharp!</li>
    <li> These are really great nail clippers.  Nice and sharp and very high quality and great price for the pair.  I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for comparable quality.</li>
    <li> My nails are very thin and weak right now, but these clippers cut sharply without any jagged edges.  This was not the case with my last cheap pair of clippers.  These are very well made and feel nice in your hand.</li>
    <li> Quality pieces. Substantial and fit well in your hand.</li>
    <li> These are hands down the best clippers I have ever owned. I use the big set on me and the little set on my 14 month old. Top notch quality material and sharp as hail.</li>
    <li> These Clippers are very durable, Effective, Precise and accurate during cutting, Very easy to use, Great design, And comes with a cute little storage bag!  I received these clippers At a Very discounted rate In exchange for my review And I would  Leave the exact same review if I paid full price for them. I absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> I started searching for a quality nail clipper set a couple of weeks ago when our finger nail clipper broke.  My wife and I have never really been happy with any of our past nail clippers as they always seem to be flimsy and they never seem to do a good job of cleanly cutting the nail.  Then again, we normally buy the cheapest ones that we can find at the local store.  So instead of buying another cheap set, I decided to conduct some research and I ended up narrowing the choices to about 3 or 4 different brands.  After reading all of the reviews, I finally decided on the Klipit as I thought it was the best value with the least amount of negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;When the set arrived, my wife and I could not get over how high quality and sturdy they felt.  The real test though is how well do they cut.  Well, I can honestly say they are the best clippers that I have ever used.  They are very sharp and have no problem cutting thick nails.  I love the fact that I am not left with sharp edges on my nails anymore.  The clippers do a great job of cutting and leaving you with a smooth nail edge.  This may be minor to some users, but another big complaint with our other clipper set was the handle that you push down with always seemed to be too loose and would always slip out of our hands as we were trying to cut our nails.  Thankfully, we no longer have that problem with the Klipit clippers as the handle stays in one place when you are cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, these are the best nail clippers I have ever used.  Shipping was fast and we loved the fact that it came with a little plastic holder for both clippers for when you are traveling.  We will definitely be recommending these to friends and family.</li>
    <li> My husband was adamant about getting &amp;#34;good clippers,&amp;#34; rather than the cheap ones we&#x27;ve been using. He chose this set based on the five star rating and we both agree: these are definitely the best clippers we&#x27;ve ever used! Very sturdy, solid feel, tight mechanism, sharp cut, and quite large!</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers even for stubborn nails, the price you pay is worth it, I always have clippers handles break on me these are very sturdy.</li>
    <li> They are good and sharp.  Though I would have a preferred a bit more flat so that they can catch the corner of the nail in the first cut, they are still preferable to other kind of cheap clippers that cut the nail in uneven and rough manner.  I like these clippers.</li>
    <li> I think the design is simple and efficient. I like that it comes in two different sizes which could be convenient. I have used them two times already and my experience has been positive. The packaging is nice and the little plastic pouch that comes with the product is handy.</li>
    <li> Right when you first pick it up you can feel the difference. How solid and comfortable they feel in your hands. The construction is just top notch, you don&#x27;t feel any flex, they just feel tough.&lt;br /&gt;They cut through your nails like butter, I did the same thing everyone else seems to do, don&#x27;t take a shower first, try them out with my nails fully dry and hard, and they cut right through cleanly without leaving traces behind, or rough edges.&lt;br /&gt;Really is a quality set of clippers well worth the money. I bought these as a backup set for work, but instead I brought my old cheap ones to work, I am keeping these at home.&lt;br /&gt;When you also have young children&#x27;s nails you cut at home, you want the best product you can have to make it as clean and painless for them as possible, and this fits the bill for that. Couldn&#x27;t be happier, I know for clippers right.. but they are that good, and having a sturdy nail file on them is just a bonus, I have always hated those little foldout nail files on my other clippers, these ones are actually easy to use because they are built into the base.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, in appearance and edge.  Top of handle has an embedded nail file.</li>
    <li> The nail clipper set arrived on time as promised. The set looks very high quality and works great. We will probably enjoy the use of this set for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Pretty impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for my dad as a gift as he is constantly struggling to cut his nails.  He loved them.  They are great quality.  It&#x27;s a worthy investment, you don&#x27;t have to worry about relief braking and even though they are a bit pricey,  the quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I greatly recommend it if you have nails that continue growing through your lifetime</li>
    <li> Both of these clippers arrived in working order and took care of a nail which gave me problems - these are what the Pro&#x27;s use !!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic pair of clippers. They are sharp and heavy duty. Only improvement would be to include or embed an under-the-nail pick.</li>
    <li> Must admit -- I never bought nail clippers in my 50 years on this planet.  They just always seemed to multiply in the medicine cabinet.  Probably has something to do with my wife and/or two daughters accumulating devices in manicure sets, etc.  That being said, and after I broke a pair or two struggling to trim my nails which are becoming more and more difficult, I purchased a Klipit set.  I can tell you -- unless they are lost or stolen, I will not be buying another pair!  These nail clippers perform flawlessly and are meant to last a lifetime.  A weighty steel construction with a precision honed cutting surface make a world of difference from pairs that you are probably familiar.</li>
    <li> These simply work great! Well made out of durable stainless steel. Sharp cutting blade so clips nails easily and with a smooth edge. Unless you lose these, they&#x27;ll be the last nail clippers you&#x27;ll ever buy. Get them.</li>
    <li> These things are great. Like many people I have continued to use the same inferior clippers for years, just not thinking there was a better way. Well there is a better way, and these Klipit clippers are it. I have rather large hands and and these clippers are easy to use with there &amp;#34;non-slip&amp;#34; texture and there incredibly sharp cutting blades. Don&#x27;t over think it, do yourself a favor and get these.</li>
    <li> Fabulously sharp, beautifully crafted and amazing value for money. Harperton is an unusual company in that it really cares what its customers think, and they are very communicative. The clippers are even better than we had hoped, and they even have a built in nail file. Excellent product - we will be buying more for family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Updated on 4/29/15 to add the following)&lt;br /&gt;Well, our British 9 year old granddaughter has the habit of clipping her nails over the toilet. She recently sent us the following cautionary tale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clippers down the loo…&lt;br /&gt;By Ella Tarin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I clipped my nails over the loo&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I dropped the clippers down the loo&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, my mum yelled at me ‘cause I dropped them down the loo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said: I was only getting ready and my hand was nice and steady,&lt;br /&gt;You know I didn’t mean to I just dropped them down the loo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mum was stubborn, she just won’t delve her hand in,&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to clip them over the bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said: Next time you drop the clippers down the loo,&lt;br /&gt;You’ll be the one delving into the poo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Mum wasn’t looking I only did a bit…&lt;br /&gt;…but halfway through I regretted it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now we really need a backup set of clippers to send her!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dawn</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband.  He swears that he has never had clippers that worked as well.</li>
    <li> shipping is fast, clippers are very sharp, handles on clipper are very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This nail set was a fantastic find, sturdy construction, and definitely made to last. Kudos for a great product...would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> These clippers are very nice.  They have a good, solid weight about them and look very professional.  They are incredibly easy to use and they cut with precision.</li>
    <li> love this kit so much!!! very handy and nice quality!!! shipped promptly!! this review is based solely on my opinion after using the product, would recommend to a friend &amp; very glad I ordered</li>
    <li> works well happy with item</li>
    <li> Clippers seem sharp and sturdy. The built in file works well but has a pretty fine grit. Came in a little travel bag with room for other small toiletries. Would clip again.</li>
    <li> finally someone made clippers that are very well built and that are nice and sharp and fit comfortably in your hand. Thanks Harperton</li>
    <li> Solidly built and cute packaging.</li>
    <li> Will be last clipper set I will ever need! Fast shipping, sharp clippers, definitely clippers a cut above the rest! Pro clippers</li>
    <li> Heavy duty, and sharp! These are pretty awesome! Can&#x27;t wait to see if they last for the long run! So far so good! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I really like these clippers...they are strong and do not slip out of my hand when I squeeze them. I get clean cuts with no hassles. Highly recommend.  You get what you pay for and these are well worth the cost.  Clippers arrived in two days.  I also like the pouch that comes with them!</li>
    <li> Good solid set of clippers. As I have arthritis, I added metal tubing extensions to increase the leverage.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly! The stainless steel is robust, it won&#x27;t rust, it cuts the toenails with ease and the fingernail clipper does a fantastic job! I had a stroke about 13 years ago, I have been looking for a replacement set of toenails &amp; fingernail clippers that won&#x27;t rust and would not slip. I found them! I could not be more pleased.</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers I have ever owned. They are sharp, precise, easy to use, and nice looking. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Top notch quality. These clippers have a nice weight to them and fit comfortably in your hands. They have a nice firm and clean cut. My old pair had very thin steel and flexed too much and eventually wore out after 5 years. These have a lifetime warranty but I doubt you will ever be using it. They are solid! I had a question and sent an email to customer service and they answered it quickly.</li>
    <li> I recently lost my one and only nail clipper (not a Harperton) and despite several lengthy searches, I finally concluded that it was gone and not returning.  I need a nail clipper to get clean cuts on my right hand nails (my left hand seems to think it&#x27;s too busy to participate in nail clipping; my right hand has no such delusions, but nails on both hands need clipping) so I went in search of My Next Great Nail Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a bunch of reviews on Amazon, I ordered the Harperton set.  It had great reviews, it looked sturdy, and I really liked the idea that a large and a slightly smaller clipper were offered as a set.  The packaging is also nice--both clippers are housed in a sturdy ziplock bag that looks like it&#x27;ll last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Harperton clipper does a really good job of clean clips.  They&#x27;re easy to operate, and feel nicely balanced in either hand.  And the design itself is elegant and nice to look at--a big improvement over the blue rubber clipper that went missing.  And starting off with a pair of clippers means that when one of them goes walk-about--all my possessions have a tendency to run away from home on a regular basis--when one disappears, I&#x27;ll still have the 2nd set at my beck and call.</li>
    <li> Very good nail clippers. Sharp, cuts evenly, has a little file. Just wish it had a way to clean underneath my nails like most other clippers have.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp. And they feel very sturdy.</li>
    <li> These Klipit Nail Clippers have exceeded any expectation I had. They work great and feel great. The delivery was quick and exactly what I expected. I would definitely recommend these nail clippers to anyone looking for a quality nail clipper.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Great product. this is a much safer clipper than many you will find at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> These are high-end clippers and I think the quality is excellent. Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheap clippers that do a crummy job and then break. I highly recommend these clippers.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have struggled along for many years with a cheap nail clipper set.  I had no idea that nails could be clipped much easier, faster and with better results until I tried my Klipit Nail Clipper Set.  It is the best and looks like it will last a lifetime.&#x27;</li>
    <li> It is hard be excited about a set of nail clippers. If I were going to, this is the set I would rave about. The quality and design of this pair of clippers is excellent. They are made of high quality stainless steel, are exceptionally sharp, and the design and finish of the lever is such that the cutting force is minimal. Overall, I an satisfied with the purchase price of $27.89 compared to the quality. If I look really hard for something to complain about, the nail file is next to useless because of the size and location. If I were traveling, I could use the file in an emergency rather than worry about getting a metal emery board through airport security. However, I didn&#x27;t expect the file supplied as part of a clipper to be of much use, so it didn&#x27;t weigh in my rating.</li>
    <li> Strong well made chippers that work perfect!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  They are extremely well constructed and cut my nails at a nice angle, not too straight and not too curved.  I also like the emery board area on the underside of the handle.  Nice for small touch-ups.  I also appreciate the case that the set comes in.  I can locate them quickly in the small bin of grooming tools I have.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy ergonomic clippers. They&#x27;re pleasantly heavy and come with a convenient carry case. I like being able to keep them together in one place, since I tend to lose other clippers frequently. The built in file is well-sized and built into the clipper level itself. It&#x27;s not a flip out file like I&#x27;ve seen on every other clipped I&#x27;ve ever used, which makes the design more succinct and attractive. It&#x27;s funny to think about finger and toenail clippers being aesthetically pleasing, but these clippers are that. And they do their job well.</li>
    <li> Klipit is by far the best nail clipper set I have ever owned - and I have bought plenty of brands over many years!  The set came to me in perfect condition, works wonderful, and was shipped immediately. I am extremely pleased with this product and the company and you will be as well.</li>
    <li> Great product that was shipped quickly. Bravo!</li>
    <li> Up front, I will say that I found and ordered this set due to the high reviews and feel (possibly) misled when I found that the company incentivizes buyers to leave good reviews here on Amazon in return for getting into their reviewer program, aka a spare set. A few reviewers here have noted their participation in this but I didn&#x27;t see those reviews stand out. So putting this up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email when I asked what it took to become a reviewer:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Thanks for your interest in our reviewer program. Claiming your backup Klipit and becoming a Product Reviewer is easy... and no travel is neede. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is write a product review on Amazon (it doesn’t have to be long but the more comprehensive the better). Here&#x27;s the link: https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asin&#x3D;B00TKS5Y3Q&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know you’ve left the review and I’ll send out your backup set right away.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to just complain so here&#x27;s my review and-based upon this being the second set of clippers I have ever bought and finding them good but not magical as others here have suggested-a 4/5 star rating. The clippers are thick and sharp; I&#x27;ve been fairly pleased with the results. They don&#x27;t feel as smooth in the motion from open to close as a La Cross clipper set I have but then again the Klipit&#x27;s toe set does fly through thicker toenails.</li>
    <li> Forget two day shipping here in SE Michigan.  These arrived the very NEXT DAY.  High quality material is obvious.  Sharp cutting edges cut precisely.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> A pleasure to have a product that works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Tried many clippers over the years and this one rocks. Sharp, aligned well, opens enough, and made quality materials. Seller was very responsive and followed up. They cared.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, kindly.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought! They are well-made, sturdy and nicely designed and come in a nice package too (hopefully will prevent me from losing them!)</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of nail clippers, cheaper ones and also some expensive ones. I have to say that I do love this one. It makes very clean cut, especially the larger one for the toes. The cut itself is so clean and neat that I don&#x27;t even need to do any extra work after that. I always have problems cutting my big toenails but with this one, it is never difficult anymore. Would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy overall great pair of clippers</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for in a clipper...sharp sturdy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Nice! Very high quality clipper set. The smaller clipper works best for me - I use the larger clipper only for my big toes.</li>
    <li> Best Nail Clippers I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> These stainless steel nail clippers from Klipit are well designed and built. They are very sharp with a handy file built into the lever which a little too small but actually works. High quality product that is easy to handle and does not slip at all in your hand. They are a little expensive but probably the last pair of clippers I&#x27;ll have to buy. I like the design too!</li>
    <li> These clippers work as well as any I have owned.  I&#x27;ve only used them about 6 times so I can&#x27;t speak to long-term use but as of now I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  They were a little more expensive than some of the others but, as they say, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  I would definitely recommend this clipper set.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied! Great grip, great style and solid feel. If you&#x27;re reading this, do yourself a favor and get you a set. The previous pair I used took the force of a hydraulic pump to cut anything! These are so smooth and cut my nails like a hot knife through butter. The grip is my favorite part because my fingers don&#x27;t slip out when I apply pressure. Overall, I&#x27;d buy these again...and I&#x27;m sure I will.</li>
    <li> I bought just the toe nailclipper. It came in a box that said that if you write a review, you would get a free second pair. That is the only reason I can think of why the reviews are all so positive. The clipper is crooked and requires a lot of force since it is shorter than regular toe nailclippers.</li>
    <li> The best quality u would like to have</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product. So far I have used it only once and I can say it is better than a lot of products I have tried in the past. I have hard toe nails and this product unlike others that I have tried does a real good job effortlessly clipping them. I would definetely recommend this product to any one.</li>
    <li> These clippers are well designed and sturdily built. They are easy to hold, super sharp, and cut through nails quickly and with ease. I also used the larger ones to clip my cats&#x27; nails, and they do a much better and cleaner job than the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; clippers, with much less complaint from the cats.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT product, and my experience with this seller was great. The clippers are top quality, delivered promptly and in professional packaging with CLEAR instructions that were actually even pretty funny/witty. Made my day. Thanks so much Harperton for the great product and top notch experience!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good set of clippers. I usually buy the cheap ones but these here really do make a difference. They&#x27;re easy to use and give a real clean clip of my nails. I&#x27;d definitely recommend them. I may need to buy an extra pair because my wife keeps stealing them.</li>
    <li> This is an attractive pair of Nail clippers, sized as usual with the smaller clipper for fingernails and the larger clipper for toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both work in the usual way with the swiveling lever. Both are sharp, and do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetically many people will find these a step above the usual discount store clipper. The lever handles are noticeably rounded. The Stainless Steel is buffed to a matte/brushed finish. There are small gold coat-of-arms insets into each of the lever handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each clipper has a large lanyard hole in the rear of the body which would allow you to attach a lanyard, or hang these on a hook, or attach them to a chain (together or separately). No chain or lanyard is included, you&#x27;d need to supply your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrived packaged in bubble wrap and a #10 Envelope, and enclosed in a small (3&amp;#34; x 4&amp;#34;?) yellow plastic Ziplock bag with the logo &amp;#34;Harperton KLIPIT Precision Nail Clippers&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are effective clippers with an appearance that&#x27;s a little dressier than the standard discount store clippers.&lt;br /&gt;If the packaging mine arrived in is standard, you&#x27;ll need to find a suitable box if you are intending to gift wrap these as a present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample sent for testing and impartial review. I hope this is helpful as you comparison shop online.</li>
    <li> These are high quality. They feel sturdy and also look super nice. Most importantly they do the job!</li>
    <li> Love these clippers!!  They really have a high quality feel and work really well.  Best clippers I have ever used. Thank you</li>
    <li> I found them to be sharp, and to require less effort to get a clean trim.  I have nerve damage in my hands, and find it difficult to hold small things, everything is slippery.  My only wish it that it was wider, but I have not dropped it yet, in fact, I&#x27;ve managed to hold onto it quite well. Every other clipper I have, and I&#x27;ve tried 15 or 20, requires a lot of pressure to make the cut, and that means it slips out of my fingers.  I&#x27;ve had to put non slip tape on them and even then, they were a problem.  I&#x27;ll likely wrap rubber tape around the grip area of this one to see if it makes a difference, but so far, it is not slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am happy with the clean cuts it makes, I don&#x27;t have to go back and trim off the frayed edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to box up my old clippers and trimmers and get rid of them.  I&#x27;ll get a few pair of these.</li>
    <li> Very high quality nail clippers. They come in their own package so I can carry them with me without worrying if they&#x27;re going to get lost or damaged. The manufacturer says they worked hard on ensuring quality and it&#x27;s very apparent, every detail seems to be thought of here</li>
    <li> After buying several cheap pairs of clippers at the grocery stores and never being happy with them I decided to go ahead and spend a little more and try to find a better quality set. I am so happy with these and just wish I would have done it sooner! The quality is amazing and I would highly recommend these to everyone!</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Excellent high quality clippers from an excellent supplier!</li>
    <li> The Klipit nail clippers I recently purchased is a welcome change from the one I bought from CVS recently.&lt;br /&gt;The construction is sturdy. The clipping edges are sharp enough to cut through my tough toe nails without breaking the nail. I like the design of the clipper that generates the force needed without a struggle.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Right out of the package this dual set of nail clippers exude quality and craftsmanship definitely not your average drugstore clippers with their brushed stainless, surgical steel finish and sleek modern design these razor-sharp precision instruments are made to last not to mention producing a smoother, cleaner cut compared to other clippers thereby reducing and/or eliminating filing time.  Also included is a handy vinyl carrying pouch along with clipping and disinfecting instructions making this offer money very well spent.</li>
    <li> Wow! These are amazing. I was quite impressed with the quality of these nail clippers. Usually I would not write a review for nail clippers but for these clippers I had to as these bad boys are awesome! They are sturdy, very easy to use and clip nails perfectly. Customer service was excellent.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a new pair of clippers and based on the reviews I got these ones. the reviewers are not wrong. they cut great, nice and sharp. I would have preferred a simpler design without the gold inlays, but they function great.</li>
    <li> I have always used drugstore clippers before, and it has been hit and miss whether they will work or not. After having a couple pair in a row that couldn&#x27;t cut through a nail, I thought there has to be a better options. I ordered these thinking they were a little expensive, but you get what you pay for. These trim nails exactly how I hoped they would. They are really solid and comfortable to use with plenty of leverage to make trimming easy. I would recommend these to anyone wanting a high quality pair of clippers.</li>
    <li> Top quality. Super shatpness mzkes it safer a.d more precise.</li>
    <li> Great clippers has nice sleek feel to it, it has a soft grip as well as a very good cut its sharp enough that is gives a good clean cut.</li>
    <li> These clippers are fine quality and an excellent value.  They are super sharp and cut clean with none of the shards left over that are so annoying.&lt;br /&gt;They come with a neat little travel case, too!</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality set of nail clippers. I received these as a gift, and was pleasantly surprised.  They are sharp, sturdy, and the nail file built in works great!</li>
    <li> One of those mundane and boring items that you don&#x27;t think about much until you need them...and then you REALLY need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I thought this set was too expensive, especially when compared to other clippers I have owned. Then, I realized that I must have bought, tried, and abandoned, enough clippers over the years, that I easily exceeded the price for this set. More about the price in a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Klipit set includes two clippers; one for your fingernails and a larger one for your toenails. Both are very well made (construction is stainless steel), and they are identical, except for the size. Many of the features seem specifically designed to address the minor annoyances that come with using such tools:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very strong, heavy, and solid feeling; this helps to control them during use;&lt;br /&gt;- The hole for attaching to a keyring is not covered when the tool is folded closed;&lt;br /&gt;- There is a small -- but very useful -- &amp;#34;emery board&amp;#34; built into the underside of the folding lever...great for smoothing rough edges after clipping;&lt;br /&gt;- They come with a small, re-sealable, &amp;#34;zip-loc&amp;#34; plastic pouch for travel and storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had difficulty with clippers slipping out of my hand during use. I put a 1&amp;#34; split-ring through the hole on each clipper, and slip my finger through it when grasping the clipper...making it much easier to control. The weight, smooth operation, and ergonomic styling of the clippers make it much easier, as well. I really appreciate that the lever does not cover – and thus interfere with – adding the split-ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, both clippers fit nicely into the zip-loc case, even with a 1&amp;#34; split-ring installed on each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair disclosure: After writing most of this review, I was looking over the packaging, and saw that there was information printed on the inside surface of the box. After unfolding it, I saw that the company offers you a second set of clippers if you are willing to write a review. There are apparently no restrictions on what you put into the review – just that you do one. Once they see that you have posted your review, they send you the second set; so the price per set is cut in half. There is a  Lifetime warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made in China – which is the only problem I see with them...I would rather &amp;#34;Buy American&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still – Highly Recommended, and I would purchase again.rs if you are willing to write a review.

    <li> Excellent product in every way. Looks like it will last a long time and it clips nails really well.</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers I have ever owned. They are extremely sharp, and the nail files they have on them are extremely well made, though I rarely have to use them because the clippers leave the edge of my nails very smooth. They are definitely worth the price, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with that lifetime warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality on them is also spectacular. They feel good in your fingers and do not slip around at all. Great for those thick toenails that you need to apply a little extra pressure to without worrying about the clippers slipping and hurting you.</li>
    <li> A great clipper set!  Really sharp and easy to use even if you have arthritic fingers! Probably easily the best I have owned. Harperton seems to aim to please .  Just an excellent product!</li>
    <li> This is a great set of nail clippers for hand and toe nails. I tried both, and both are very sharp. The main thing is that it does not crack the layers of your nail bed when cutting- dull nail clippers will do that. I also did not soak my feet and hands in water, as recommended, before using. Let&#x27;s face it, no one has time to do that.</li>
    <li> These are beautiful, high quality clippers!  I was very impressed when I opened the box and found this handy pair of clippers packaged in a nice resealable pouch for travel and storage.  They have a nice quality weight to them and a beautiful brushed metal finish.  When I flipped them over I was surprised to find the underside of the handle has a nice emery board feature that really works (unlike others with the just the etched pattern on them).  They work great!  Definitely can tell a difference between these and drugstore cheapies.  They are sharp and cut easily and precisely.  There is a nice decorative gold emblem on the top which adds even more to the quality, high end look.  The 2 sizes are perfect for both hands and toes.  This would make a great gift for anyone, but especially those hard to buy men on your list!</li>
    <li> As soon as you open the pack you will notice the difference in these clippers. They are more substantial than your normal nail clippers at 1 oz for fingernail, and 1.6 oz for the Toe nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;They work well and are very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the quality of the file on the underside of the lever, but wish it were a bit longer and mounted on the clipper portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are well made clippers and I do recommend them.</li>
    <li> Simple choice. Finally I&#x27;m able to say I have the perfect set of clippers. Bought countless others, time and time again only to have consistently been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a home run - they feel great and give a smooth clean cut (no more scratching myself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone - do yourself a service and pick up a set and never worry about buying clippers again.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and user friendly clippers. Both sizes appear very high quality. I have thick toenails and the large size did the trick. If something utilitarian can be considered attractive, these are! The cuts were sharp and clean. I&#x27;ve only used them once. The true test will be if they stay sharp, and &amp;#34;springy&amp;#34;.</li>
