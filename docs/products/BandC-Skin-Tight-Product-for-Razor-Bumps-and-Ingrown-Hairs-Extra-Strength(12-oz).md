<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not only does this product work, its amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did research on Prop 65 Warning and then did individual research on every single ingredient. After research I discovered that this product has Aspirin in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspirin according to California Prop 65 is it considered to cause Birth Defects. The prop only requires a warning on anything that&#x27;s included on its list. ( Which Aspirin is known to cause many things to humans in great quantities.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not worried about the small levels of Aspirin in this bottle and unless you are dumping the bottle down your throat every night, you shouldn&#x27;t be either. Everything else in this product is harmless really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are NOT pregnant, do not worry that this is going to be the end all to future children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are pregnant you have more to worry about bumps on your face.</li>
    <li> This product works. Within a week, my shaving area is clear of ugly bumps.</li>
    <li> I know this products seems expensive, but it&#x27;s the only product that has ever managed to really keep my skin from having bumps. Use diligently.</li>
    <li> I have been doing a brazilian wax and i have noticed the ingrown hair problem steadily getting worse. I ordered this, beacause the reviews I read were from african american women that said this product was amazing, and I know my brothers wife (who is also african american) has actually went to the hospital to get gauze packed over ingrown hairs because they have gotten so bad. So when they say a product works I believe them.  It does not work for a caucasion woman&#x27;s bikini line. So try something else if that&#x27;s why you are considering this product.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased. Great for preventing ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> This will clog the pours so your hairs can&#x27;t grow out and you will have many ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Quick results!  Without this my skin was always sore and raw after shaving(with clippers). 1st time in my life I can actually shave with a razor and not have to worry about razor bumps or ingrown hairs!</li>
    <li> Great. Just what I expected</li>
    <li> I used this product on my legs and it worked great! I began seeing results after just a couple of days.  By day 5, bumps were gone and shaving was no longer a problem! I used it twice a day for about a week and then once a day after that. I use this product with Shea butter Moisturizer and it works very well for me. Since the bottle is not user friendly, I would uncap the bottle and let the liquid absorb onto a couple of cotton balls. I found this way to work best!</li>
    <li> After 48 years on the planet and a 13 year stint in the military where shaving was mandatory I could find NOTHING to stop the bumps when I shaved.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find a solution before I left the military, but I finally did find a solution in the product Skin Tight, it works like a dream and now I can let my hair grow or have a close shave without worrying about PAIN, my days of pain when I shave are over thanks to Skin Tight, I use it everyday even when I don&#x27;t shave and the stuff just works for me.</li>
    <li> This product works as promise.</li>
    <li> This product got rid of the razor bumps on my legs in a few months.  I used it once before bed and once in the morning after getting out of the shower.  The smell isnt&#x27; pleasant, but my perfume and lotion was able to mask it.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am an African American female, who loves Brazilian waxes. I started using this product after my first wax, which hurt like hell. Well,after i started using this product and went back for my second wax it was a breeze. This product is amazing. While she is waxing me, i read a book, because there is very little pain. If you have a problem with in-grown hair, this is the answer to your problems.</li>
    <li> it works well but it has a very unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite items</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this stuff works!  I had a an area of ingrown hair on my bikini line which seemed to come out of nowhere, and it had gotten infected.  After about 24 hours from applying B&amp;C, I could start to tell a difference.  It dried out the infection and the ingrown hairs slowly started to surface, enabling me to pluck them out.  I also started applying this to my underarms twice a day, and I really can tell a difference.  My underarms have started to become much smoother.  I love this stuff, and will be ordering another bottle when I run out!</li>
    <li> This works great to prevent ingrown hairs and razor bumps! It does burn a little on freshly shaved areas, but it better than having an unsightly rash from shaving. You do have to use it as directed on the bottle or the razor bumps will show up if you skip an application.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great because, it really stops the ingrown hairs. Beware though you will get dried out skin but honestly just scrub it off because of wards it like a snake effect everything feels so fresh and new.</li>
    <li> This product not only shrinks hair bumps, but it does so rapidly. Be careful though; use it as directed or skin irritation will be caused.</li>
    <li> This product really works reducing ingrown hair bumps from shaving.  I wish I had known about Skin Tight 30 years ago.</li>
    <li> I have coarse &amp; curly whiskers that wreak havoc on my neck area. In four days (8 applications) my neck is almost completely clear!  Here&#x27;s how I did it:  1. Hot shower &amp; exfoliate (I never shave without first taking a hot shower). 2.  Badger brush and shaving soap or cream, face lather. 3. Shave. 4. Remove any ingrown hairs with an ingrown hair tweezers. 5. Apply Skin Tight to affected areas of ingrown hair. I use a cotton pad for this. You don&#x27;t need a lot, a little goes a long way. 6. Apply any other products (styptic, spot treatment, etc. ). 7. Moisturize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doing all of these things before Skin Tight, but ingrown hairs persisted. It was only after adding skin tight to my daily regimen that i was able to realize improvements in my ingrowns. Since improving my routine I no longer have flaky skin on my chin, no white heads after shaving, less visible scars from acne. My face skin has improved dramatically &amp; Skin Tight just helped me take it to another level.</li>
    <li> As a lady with PCOS, I have to deal with thick, black hairs growing where they should not. I have to pluck them out, one by one, which is enough of a chore in itself. But having sensitive skin and being human basically means that I will always get the lovely red bumps within a few days or less. I&#x27;m the kind of person who can&#x27;t stand bumps on my body anywhere, and must then squeeze or dig at the offending thing until I feel the area is sufficiently \\&quot;smooth.\\&quot; I wish I didn&#x27;t have that compulsion, but I do. I needed something that was going to prevent those ingrown hairs/painful red bumps/pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found another product that did help to some degree. I&#x27;ll just say it&#x27;s in a blue bottle and takes your breath away if you attempt to spray it on and get it anywhere near your nose/open mouth. (I used a small spray bottle to make the product last longer and get more of it on my skin than your average cotton ball can apply.) I had to stand in front of a fan immediately after applying it to avoid choking. Also, my skin was left feeling quite greasy/oily and remained that way until I washed my face. Needless to say, I was not entirely happy with the stuff even though it had rave reviews on Amazon. The cons of the product outweighed the pros, and I wasn&#x27;t applying it day/night like I should have because I just hated the smell and the greasy residue it left on my skin and couldn&#x27;t keep up the religious application regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my bottle of \\&quot;that stuff\\&quot; ran out, I came back to Amazon and this product, Skin Tight, somehow popped up while I was searching. It was more affordable and had tea tree oil in it, which I actually like the smell of. So I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, it&#x27;s only been a week and I can already tell this stuff works as well or better than the \\&quot;other stuff.\\&quot; Not only is the smell a lot more tolerable, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like a grease bucket afterwards! There is *some* alcohol in it, but nothing like the other product. I spray it on, pat it in the trouble spots with my fingers and then wash my hands -- all without needing a fan, lol. The redness in my neck area, which was so bad I was honestly worried I&#x27;d be scarred there forever, is fading dramatically. It&#x27;s healing the bumps that I had all over my cheeks and \\&quot;sideburn\\&quot; area. I&#x27;m even tempted to start spraying this on my upper thighs and the sides of my calves where I tend to get clogged pores from shaving because it is working wonders on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I look forward to putting on makeup again (something I haven&#x27;t had the heart to do for quite some time) because my face is clearing up so wonderfully that I can actually focus on enhancing my features rather than covering up the unsightly red bumps and irritated scabs. It&#x27;s helping me feel like a woman again, which is something I struggle with due to the PCOS-induced hirsutism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just so impressed and elated with this product and I can&#x27;t see myself ever going back to the stuff in the blue bottle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually buy this product from amazon but I wanted to review it for people who might be interested in it but have some reservations. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I am an African American woman with fair skin. I have been battling thick facial hair since elementary school. In high school I started shaving because hair removal creams just didn&#x27;t work, the hair was too coarse. Shaving caused me to have really bad razor burn and I tried everything under the sun to make them go away. I did well to find a make up regimen to hide the five o&#x27;clock shadow but those bumps were still VERY visible. I am going to an event where I have to be around a lot of people up close and I was so worried about these bumps. Last Friday (2/6) I saw this product and I bought it. I began using it the next day and I didn&#x27;t get any new irritation after shaving. I&#x27;ve used it daily since then and after only 4 days of use my chin and neck are smooth. I still have scarring from old razor bumps but I have a flawless face after I apply my make up and I am soooo happy about that! I&#x27;m fine with wearing makeup to cover the scarring but those bumps had to go! And thanks to this product that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening right before my eyes. I bought this product with my own money at a grocery store in Chattanooga. I love it and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> if you have curly facial hair that causes hair bumps, this product will help. large quantity. price is right compared to walmart. i would recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six months now and find that it does help make razor burns smaller and it feels good too!</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this product! I was so happy when we found it online at such an affordable price</li>
    <li> If you have a tea tree allergy do not use!!!!! I am still recovering from the rash. Wish I had known.</li>
    <li> Needed a product for ingrown hairs and b&amp;c dried out the bumps in a matter of days. Caution, it does burn when first applied but the burn feeling quickly goes away. I went from applying it every morn and night to twice a week. I have told friends about it, men and women and they have purchased it and they agree also.</li>
    <li> Works wonders  on ingrown hairs and other skin afflictions! I definitely recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> I cant believe this I had a hair bump on my chin for almost 2 years looking like nanny mcfee  thank the lord this removed it</li>
    <li> Simply put this works exactly as it states it will.  A little pricey but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Product reduces my in-grown hairs on my legs but I still get them.  This works okay on small bumps, but I still get really large and painful welts from shaving.  Plus, this product smells really bad and makes my legs sticky.  Its not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I ordered and it came as promised when indicated</li>
    <li> I used skin tight since 96 its the best on the market well thats my opinon</li>
    <li> Ye, it stinks.  Once you get passed the smell and awkward application (water-like solution disposed from a lotion-like top) you&#x27;ll be a believer!  Not only does it slow/stop ingrown hairs where most of the thicker hair shaving occurs, but it smooths the high thigh area...who knew!  I&#x27;m reordering now!</li>
    <li> Best razor bump product out period. I battled with bumps for years. Get this, a good shaving soap, a good safety razor and feather blades and you will be on your way to a smooth face.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I&#x27;ve always had issue with razor bumps and this is the first thing I&#x27;ve used that has made a noticeable difference. It is very strong smelling, but it dissipates quickly and also gives me the impression it is strong and working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years! No problems, it not only works for razor bumps, but it does a heck of a job on acne! If I get a pimple, I just dab Skin Tight on it the night before and wah-lah it&#x27;s diminished by morning and gone the next day ( after another application of course) try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ingrown hair always gave me headache after I shave. That&#x27;s why I hated shaving. Since I started using this product, definitely noticed the difference. This works for both male and female, because my girlfriend uses it too.</li>
    <li> It works, It works, it works! I have been using similar products for over a year and none have compared to one week worth of using this product.  I have fair skin but dark course hair and with any kind of waxing or shaving I get terrible ingrown hairs that turn into a mess for weeks.  This has cleared up blemishes in days.  Would recommend highly.  Plus, with other products there was a sting to it, this felt very very gentle..  never know it was even applied.  it does have a strong astringent smell to it, but not enough for me to stop using it..</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for razor bumps...and because of the tea tree oil, it&#x27;s also good on bug bites and other minor skin irritations.</li>
    <li> I still get ingrown hairs even when meticulously using Skin Tight, but they&#x27;re not as bad as they used to be.  This stuff does burn quite a bit if you&#x27;re using this product after doing a gently exfoliating scrub to help alleviate ingrowns.  I&#x27;ve also noticed dry skin, but I now use a moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> I am miffed that this warning was not included in the description. I would not have bought this product if I had known it had this warning. This is a toxic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;California Proposition 65 Warning: WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to cause birth defects or reproductive harm&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to get my money back.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for over a year now &amp; it change my life big time! I personally recommend it for any one who has severe ingrown problems, this stuff is the truth.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a good job</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American male who loves the feel of a nice shave but hate the damage it does to my skin. This product began clearing up my neck area and closing the pores overnight. Had I found this product years ago, life would have been so much better...including my appearance. You will need a descent moisturizer to avoid over drying the application areas. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am a 40 year old white male and when the whiskers started to go white, my neck was a nightmare of bumps and bleeding every time I shaved. I tried everything under the sun from top of the line razors, creams, aftershaves, letting my whiskers grow long before shaving and tried shaving every day, cold shaves, hot shaves etc etc - nothing worked. I found this local and it flies off the shelf - and hard to find, but let me tell you, this stuff works amazing! No more bumps, no razor burn after shaving and a nice clean shave now every time. I decided to stop putting it on for a few weeks and the problem returned, so it was for sure this amazing product! It does take a few days to a week to get everything in line and after that, I just apply some every other day to keep my skin in good shape. If you have had problems with bad shaves, try this stuff out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 35-year-old white female. European, fair skin and hairy...ah yes, the wonders of a European woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use tweezers daily between eyebrows, under and above eyebrows. During my first pregnancy, I started growing hair on my upper lip and a lot on my jaw line. I was so embarrassed that I paid almost 4k to have laser hair treatment. Waste of my money!! So, I&#x27;m back to shaving, tweeting and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t use this product, I get in-grown hair and a rash from shaving. No one wants in-grown hairs as they look like pimples. Especially around the face area, and bikini area. Makes every woman feel un-attractive. This solution doesn&#x27;t smell very good so I use it sparingly on the face in the morning. I use more at night. Result...no more in-grown hairs, no pimples and no rashes. I&#x27;m so excited!&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s pricy but it&#x27;s so worth the money as it has given me confidence!</li>
    <li> Not marked online, upon receiving this bottle, it is clearly marked &amp;#34;May cause reproductive damage.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Better then tend skin!! I mean it</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby who suffers from razor bumps and in-grown hairs along his neck and jawline. Prior to this, he avoided shaving and simply grew a beard, but once we found this product, he shaves regularly and uses this to avoid in-grown hair bumps. He is African American, so his hair curls in on itself and causes tons of bumps if he doesn&#x27;t use this product. Well worth the money, and the deal on here is much better than anywhere else I&#x27;ve looked.</li>
    <li> Excellent product will recommend to anyone. Only product that worked for me, the razor rash disappeared over night. Will most definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> After dealing with really terrible ingrown hairs from waxing and shaving my nether regions, and trying lots of other techniques and products (exfoliating until i was sure my skin would fall off and using other products) this stuff has been amazing. Used it to treat problematic areas and since I&#x27;ve started haven&#x27;t seen nary an ingrown.</li>
    <li> I have black heads and white heads. Works like a charm and my better half uses to prevent and treat razor bumps and ingrown hairs. Miracle in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I use to use this product  but I read the back and it has a disclaimer for BIRTH DEFECTS! Never again after that day I have never used the product. It worked very well but I dont want to risk my unborn children</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail yesterday I have no desire to open it and am sending it back. Warning label on back says... this product contains chemicals known to cause birth defects or reproductive harm.... no thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used so many products over the years and have never found one that works til now.  I burns on application my skin was clear after the first week!</li>
    <li> not sure if this was tampered with but it came with no safety seal and smelled of kerosine when i applied it it burned and left pustules all over the area it was applied. DO NOT BUY THIS BAD BAD BAD</li>
    <li> This totally works for acne.  My son was riddled with it before we discovered this stuff.  When his beard started to come in the acne got even worse.  He doesn&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Had issues with break outs on my scalp after clipper cuts. Works better than anything I have used.</li>
    <li> i am still trying to find the perfect ingrown hair and unfortunately this was not it...but still did notice skin peeling etc from it so not useless. one tip is that to use gloves when applying because the fingers on my skin would peel too from when i applied it since it touched my hands even though i was not applying it to my hands..does that make sense?</li>
    <li> If you suffer from ingrown hairs from shaving or plucking, this is exactly what you need.  It really works.  If I use it every day I have no ingrown hairs and if I slack off for a few days they come back!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in using this product.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with razor bumps but treat my skin after shaving to prevent from having them.  I usually just wipe down with alcohol after shaving and enduring the mild sting and then rinsing and applying a moisturizer since alcohol will dry the skin out as well as tighten the pours.  I get the same mild sting from this product so no noticable difference other than the cost of this vs the cost of a bottle of alcohol (the alcohol is much cheaper).</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard. I have to shave it very two days and before I found this, I had ingrown hairs, razor burn, razor bumps and irritation, 2 days after using this product I saw and felt a major difference. I no longer have ingrown annoying hairs, no more razor burn or bumps. It is a life savor. I feel more confident and my skin feels awesome. I&#x27;ve seriously tried all the lotions and after shave stuff and nothing compares to this. This is my second bottle. The first one lasted about 4 to 5 months using it every time is have.  Highly recommend this for all parts of the body as well.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a barber in my hometown in Arkansas.  I was having a real problem with razor bumps.  The thing is that I had acne all through high school, until my senior year it was starting to clear up and then I joined the Army and began shaving regularly.  Here I go again.  Tried all kinds of bump fighter products, razors, shave creams etc.  Nothing worked!  I ran into this barbershop and he hooked me up with a straight razor shave and samples of the extra strength skin tight.  Of course I had to have a mild surgery to remove embedded hairs, shave and then treat with skin tight. It nearly worked over night.  I noticed a big difference after 5 days of twice a day treatment.  It can be tedious, but leaves my face smooth and bumpless!  I got the moisturizer that I use periodically for dryness and peeling, but it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have razor bumps, use this stuff to clear it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0019Q89VQ B&amp;C Skin Tight Product for Razor Bumps &amp; Ingrown Hairs-Extra Strength(12 oz)]]</li>
    <li> This product works very good for me.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this!! I have been ordering it for years and will continue using forever, I put some in a little spray bottle and spray on my back to keep it clear, use on bikini area and it works really well on insect bites too!!!! It never irritates but it is strong and very potent, truly an amazing product!</li>
    <li> My husband uses it everyday, and I can&#x27;t do without it in the summer- (no bikini-line bumps).  It is a must have!</li>
    <li> I like this product, I&#x27;ve tried some other ones but so far this one works the best for bumps and ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that helps with ingrown hairs and razor burn for YEARS.  This product does the trick!  I have very sensitive skin, so it can be a little drying, but I just skip a day and it&#x27;s fine.  I know it&#x27;s a little spendy, but it is worth it; works great, and the bottle lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> This stings and doesn&#x27;t smell that great. But it works. I have had less ingrown hair from using this. I would purchase it again</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for nearly 2 years now and it is the best product that I have found to reduce ingrown hairs and razor bumps from shaving. Use it everyday!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without this stuff. helps clears up all razor burns and i haven&#x27;t had any issues from it at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a black male who struggles with razor bumps. I found this to be the most helpful, I only gave it 4 stars because I hate the smell.</li>
    <li> Follow directions to obtain desired results. Works like it should if used correctly and twice daily. Stings but I deal with it.</li>
    <li> I have used skin tight ever since I was about 21 years old, when one of my fraternity brothers saw me at a party and promptly pulled me to the side because my ingrown hairs were so bad. When I first started shaving I had no clue what to do. My Pops suggested a depilatory but I had no time for that messy madness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comes Skin Tight. Ever since that great Brother gave me the bottle I have not looked back. It took about a week to get all of the ingrown hairs out of my neck and face, but once it did I was able to utilize a straight razor and get that close shave I so desired. This is also helpful for your man-scaping too fellas. As many of the ladies here suggest, it can be used anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it stop ingrown hairs but it also is a deep astringent, keeping all of your sensitive shaving areas ultra clean nearly eliminating white heads and other marks from forming anywhere near your shaving areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR BLACK PEOPLE&#x27;S VERY KINKY HAIRS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to yell, but seriously, don&#x27;t stop, pass go or dee-lay. Get this if you shave - period.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it..</li>
    <li> amazing product that actually works to keep my face clear and bump free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 28yr old black male,this helped out alot almost more than anything i&#x27;ve ever used. I still use a little of this at night but use Bump Patrol just after shaving.</li>
    <li> Product works as described.  Easily minimizes razor bumbs from being seen, once you get past the smell of the product.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This works well, but beware that is a large bottle and lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I really like the product.  I hate shaving bc as soon as I shave i develop a pizza face and it last for weeks.  I decided to try the product and used it as recommended.  After I shaved I used it and initially it burned but after a minute I got use to the sensation.  I then used it three times a day for the next three days.  normally when I shave I feel the razor burn for two days.  After day three I used it once a day in the mornign.  I notice a dramatic drop in the bumps/ acne, like night and day.  I then altered my technique and after day three I would use it in the after non instead of morning or at night.  This worked perfect for me, since I would wash my face in the morning anyway when I showered.  My problems seemed to have occured in the after noon when my face would get oily again.  So by using it in the afternoon, I took care of the worst time and bumps gone and so is the acne.  So basically to summarize I used the product three times a day for three days after shaving, and once a day in the after noon there after, but make sure you wash you face in the morning and before bed.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I purchased this for my boyfriend and in 2 days we noticed a big difference</li>
    <li> Shave my chest occasionally, and days after am reminder why I stopped.  Razor Burn, bumps and then ingrown hairs.  I let it grow back in and then found this product.  Bought it and tried again, applying this immediately after.  I did get one initial ingrown hair after the first time but no others since.  No bumps or razor burn at all.  Slight sting when apply it, but that subsides quickly.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great stuff Skin Tight to my rescue had some razor bumps from ingrown hairs this stuff always clears them right up but use it as directed apply a small amount on a cotton ball and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is a staple for my skin .  It definitely decreases ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> Nothing seemed to work on my razor bumps my barber told me about this product all I can say is WOW will never run low amazon fast shipping as usual ,42 yr African American</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and it ships quickly!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. I get really bad ingrown hairs from shaving that ultimately turn into cysts. This product has worked wonders. It prevents these cysts from forming saving me a lot of discomfort and pain. No more trip to the dermatologist!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product does help ingrown hairs come to the surface.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but does a decent job.  However, if you are a woman who is trying to conceive or pregnant do not use this product.  It falls under California Proposition 65, meaning if contains chemicals that are known to cause birth defects and cause reproduction harm.  I am TTC and had used this product for over a month before noticing the warning.  And I researched this product directly on the Skin Tight website before buying and didn&#x27;t see any warnings.  I contacted the company directly requesting a refund and they denied me, even though they confirmed they didn&#x27;t have the warning on their website and said, &amp;#34;we are making the correct changes to our website to reflect the prop 65.&amp;#34;  I won&#x27;t ever buy another Skin Tight product again.</li>
    <li> There is not much else to say other than it really works.  I am a female that has been suffering from hair ingrown (I epilate my legs) and having dark spots in the skin after the hair removal(with my fair skin is very noticeable).  This stuff has helped me a lot, but it didn&#x27;t solv the problem completely.  But my legs look much better now.  One helpful advise how to use if you don&#x27;t want to waste the product (your money, too)- put on gloves (like surgical) first and then pour some of the solution on the palm of your hands and then apply this product on your skin.  Gloves will prevent your hands from over drying.  I know that the instruction recommends to use a cotton ball but I find it very wasteful.  It will you save LOTS money.  One bottle will lasts around 2 months using gloves and applying it twice a day.</li>
    <li> African American Male found this product to be utterly useless. Smells terrible</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Just be careful if you have sensitive skin. Do not use it everyday. Otherwise it does what it says!</li>
    <li> This has been the best product I have found to control and manage ingrown hairs and razor bumps from shaving.</li>
    <li> Best product for razor bumps I&#x27;ve ever used. I got the 25oz bottle and it only takes about a squirt. Use for a week after your haircut and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> To all the black men out there, order this right away. That&#x27;s all I am saying. Don&#x27;t put too much when you use it.</li>
    <li> With I can shave every day. With the grain against the grain literally don&#x27;t matter.  Without this shaving period FOR ME is just no fun.  I use it twice a day head and face.  Flat works for me.</li>
    <li> Great success with this product over others for my horrible turkey neck.  Great Job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a multitude of remedies to combat ingrowns on my bikini line, and this is the only thing that&#x27;s worked thus far, and I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a week! I apply it twice a day with a thin cotton facial pad so as not to waste product and am amazed with the progess it&#x27;s made in such a short amount of time. Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried it all, but this is the best! While it is a bit pricey, it&#x27;s cheaper than the most popular otc treatment, should last a long time if you conserve and best of all it WORKS!</li>
    <li> I used to get major irritations after shaving. Mainly on the inside and back of my thighs, as well as my bikini area. Razor burn, ingrown hairs, tiny white heads, everything terrible you can get. It was so bad i thought it could be folliculitis.&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine had bought a tiny roller ball of a similar product from her waxer and payed an outrageous amount. So I went directly to amazon to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is perfect and the price is just right. I try to apply twice a day, I&#x27;ve noticed that&#x27;s the key to keeping the irritation at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I started using a cotton round to apply and that was a failure. Then i tried just putting some in my hand and rubbing it in, but that was  wasteful. I put some into a small spray bottle and that seems most effective right now.&lt;br /&gt;A note on the spay bottle though, it lets the product &amp;#34;gas off&amp;#34; more. and the fumes are rough. It can almost take your breath away. Make sure you&#x27;re in an open room or at least have a vent on in the bathroom when you spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of right now, this is pretty much Holy Grail status for me and I am SO glad i found i!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been trimming my face with a beard trimmer for years because I was afraid of getting ingrown hairs. I finally decided to adjust my style and I began shaving again. After searching for something to put on my face, I stumbled upon this. Although they sell this at my local grocer, Amazon has the best price by far. Even Sally&#x27;s hairdresser discount doesn&#x27;t touch the price you get from buying it here. Anyway, this keeps your face very smooth. The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but that doesn&#x27;t last vey long. If you&#x27;re suffering from ingrown hairs, don&#x27;t hesitate. Buy this product now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*hint. I also bought Cremo shaving cream from Amazon and the combination is perfect. My face is so smooth and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Im a guy, I shave my chest and used to get a lot of ingrown painful hairs on my upper chest. My girlfriend told me about this product so I bought it and have been using it for a little while. All my ingrown hairs are gone and my upper chest is clear of bumps. Burns a little when used after shower. Great product, if you are a guy and have the same problem, try this it works.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I find it smells a little funny but really works!!!</li>
    <li> Works great to prevent ingrown facial hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now had this product for about 5-6 months and I can safely say that it does not work on my son&#x27;s hair bumps on the nape of his neck.  It makes the skin very dry and that&#x27;s about it.  When I discontinued using this ointment and started using only 100% tea tree oil, the bumps started going away.</li>
    <li> I like to stay baby smooth but when you save you get those bumps everywhere that razor touches you. I also use Nair but bumps still pop up!! YUK!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this! It&#x27;s easy to use no bad smell. I use it twice a day and even though it makes that area peal just a bit I remain smooth even when the hair grows back. Ordering this from Amazon is much cheaper than the stores even with shipping. Ladies and gents trust me this wont irritate your skin or sensitive areas if applied only where needed.</li>
    <li> I have had the unpleasant experience of ingrown hairs in the pubic area.  Not from shaving, just regular hairs.  Very frustrating and embarassing.  This product does work.  However, the smell is not very pleasant, which is fine since it is effective.  The other thing I have experienced using it is peeling and discolored skin in the area being treated.  Pretty minor but still unsightly.  Overall I am pleased with the final result though.</li>
    <li> I started using Skin Tight about 2 years ago. I use it every other day after I shave,  as a result I don&#x27;t get any razor bumps! This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> I highly do not recommend this product. The ingredients that were used to make this are  very unhealthy for your body it may &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; to get rid of the problem but it is causing damage to your skin as it &amp;#34;helps&amp;#34; you</li>
    <li> works fine, but then I noticed the warning label on the back side of the bottle: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS CHEMICALS KNOWN TO CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS AND REPRODUCTIVE HARM.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to stop ingrown hair on my face that bad, so I shelved it and opted for another product.</li>
    <li> if you break out after shaving then you have to have it. remember one thing - when you shave you have to use it right after and use it religiously. NOT when you are going to see bumps but right after shave. my partner is black and is using this as well, looks like the only thing that works on his skin. i usually use it right after shave and then maybe once or twice a day for next 2-3 days, you might need to use longer depending on your skin but if you feel like yoor skin is getting irritated then put it on immediately!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a wide variety of products, but none quite as effective as this one. I&#x27;ve seen a significant change in the overall quality of my skin (neck, chin area) and have encountered much less irritation. I&#x27;d highly recommend anyone experiencing dryness, irritation, itching, etc. to switch over to this product. I think you&#x27;ll notice immediate results. I like to apply this after a shave...daily. It really helps.</li>
    <li> if used consistently works wonders of blackheads and blemishes especially in bikini area!</li>
    <li> I am a 25 year old female who suffers from Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome since I was 16 years old, it causes ingrown hair on my face. These ingrown hairs cause inflammation and also excessive itching and unforgivable dark marks. I was very skeptical when it came to using this product. I have to say that this product works. Being diagnosed with PCOS most doctors do not want to treat the condition. Most want to give birth control or spironolactone which only decreases the amount of testosterone and increase the amount of estrogen  in our system. I have use benzoyl peroxide, skin bleaching creams, i even tweeze the hair out (by the way takes all day). This is the only product that works. What many of you may not know, is that this product makes your skin peel, and it is supposed to do that to get rid of the dead skin. This is the only way to get clean and clear skin. I have heard so many people complain that their skin is peeling, but duh that what it is supposed to do. You have to be patient and let the product work, which may take a day or two. to be honest this product works overnight. I highly recommend (be patient and give it a try), it will save money and another doctors appointment. Trust me  (by the way I am a Certified Medical Assistant).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 and for some reason have recently lost that smooth leg look and am now dealing with ingrown hairs and razor burn. After 1 MONTH of using this I would say I&#x27;ve seen 70% improvement...and climbing. Thank you so much for this product! Already sporting some scandalous skirts...with confidence! ;)</li>
    <li> Ladies, if you&#x27;re prone to ingrown hairs around your bikini line, or anyplace else, using this product after shaving will prevent them. If you already have a few ingrown hairs you&#x27;re battling from before you discovered this magic elixir, just apply it once daily until they heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this as a spot treatment for pimples. It worked just as well to help heal those and clear up my face as it did for my razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works as well if not better than one I used to use which cost me more than twice as much. It&#x27;s become one of those products I&#x27;m never without now.</li>
    <li> This product really helps squeeze those ingrown hairs out. It didn&#x27;t prevent razor bumps for me though. I guess it just sort of dries out the ingrown hair so that you can easily tweeze it out.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I can actually use a razor now since I have been using it. My skin used to look like a pickle after I shaved before.</li>
    <li> Last week I got bad razor bumps all over my legs right before a big date. A friend recommended Tend Skin to me but it was out of stock and I needed to get rid of the rash quickly so I bought Skin Tight instead. I&#x27;ve been applying it religiously since then and so far it has had absolutely no effect on my razor burn or ingrown hairs. My legs are just as bumpy and red as ever. For the price I would&#x27;ve expected to see some kind of improvement by now. I feel like I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
    <li> I just received this product about a week ago &amp; been using it &amp; I must say this product is AMAZING!!!! I&#x27;ve been dealing with ingrown hair for 8 years &amp; tried so many products past years before B&amp;C &amp; nothing didn&#x27;t work. I was always had to hide my beautiful thighs every summer because of those embarrassing bumps!! Well not anymore Thanks to the reviews here on Amazon made me wanted to purchase it and try it out. This products works guaranteed  folks believe me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s-I like this product very much but not the smell &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do its job and has a bad odor.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Im a man, i used this product for preventing ingrowns from a chest and abdomen waxing i did. Well, the product works, but not as i expected. It helped in reducing the time needed for the hair to break the skin, but still got ingrowns, but got rid of them faster. Also i had a problem with dryness because of this product, or maybe because the purpose of it is to exfoliate the skin, but i had peeling skin, like the one you get from sunburn, so it didn&#x27;t look good.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works if you have razor bumps please try this. Everytime I shave my bikini line I always put this stuff on.</li>
    <li> I am a Trinidadian and I recently bought B&amp;C because I have been having problems with razor bumps for years especially when I do a Brazilian wax. Within 3 days of using this product all the bumps started to fade and now no new ones have appeared. I must say that this product delivers exactly what it states. It is a little more expensive that the other products I used but it is worth every penny. I will be continuing to use this product in the future for sure Thanks B&amp;C</li>
    <li> works very well, my only issue is the smell of it</li>
    <li> The best &amp; most effective product I have ever been blessed to use to take care of my very sensitive skin. I will continue to recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s willing to listen try it. Thanks for saving my face.</li>
    <li> I use the cream for my bikini line (you can also use it for the top part as well) and this liquid kind on my legs. I apply it wherever needed twice a day. I&#x27;ve had ingrown hairs on my legs since I was a teenager, and finally in my early 20&#x27;s they are disappearing! But of course if you have sensitive skin like me, you have to use razors and shaving creams for sensitivity. But yes this product works but you have to use it daily! Helps with itching, dry skin, and does not burn to much. As long as you don&#x27;t scratch the area.</li>
    <li> The product itself works. It smells pretty astringent and can sting when you dab it onto freshly shaven areas... but it does what it says and when used I don&#x27;t have razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However! There is a California prop 65 warning. This product has chemicals that is known to cause reproductive harm. I spoke with a friend who works at an international chemical corporation about the warning and asked her if I&#x27;m overreacting and can use this on my bikini area. She told me, very clearly, to take the warning seriously and that using this anywhere is not a good idea, as the chemicals on the prop 65 warnings are known to cause birth defects. Since I&#x27;m not ruling out kids in the future, I&#x27;ve stopped using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the people to whom this doesn&#x27;t apply: this works really well!</li>
    <li> This product has a disclaimer on the bottle that reads &amp;#34;this product contains chemicals known to cause birth defects and reproductive harm.&amp;#34; I think it is awful that that was not highlighted in the description. I order a bunch of products from Amazon and didn&#x27;t take this out and read the bottle until it was too late to return. I have wasted $25 on a product that should have disclosed this warning in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will NOT buy from this company ever again.</li>
    <li> literally in 3 days, i&#x27;ve seen major results.  For anyone who has PCOS and suffers with hirsutism and ingrown hair, this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Perfect skin treatment</li>
    <li> I am an African American female who suffers from hairs on my chin. For years, I plucked and shaved them, eventually developing serious ingrown hair bumps which are unsightly under make-up. I tried many products for ethnic skin to relieve the problem, even visiting a dermatologist for different prescriptions, but nothing worked. I researched online for possible remedies and came across the site for B&amp;C Skin Tight. I read several positive reviews, then quickly visited my beauty supply store. I was fortunate to obtain a few sample packets. I tried it and had almost immediate improvement! Within a week, the bumps virtually disappeared! I now use the Razor &amp; Bump Astringent in the morning and the Ingrown Hair &amp; Razor Bump Creme at night. The website says not to be used with the astringent but I&#x27;ve had no problems. In fact, the creme moisturizes because the astringent can be somewhat drying to the skin. When I get a little lax and don&#x27;t use the products for a few days, the bumps return. Skin Tight products are a bit pricey but less expensive than prescription products and give fantastic results!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this if you have sensitive skin as it has a considerable sting to it after application. This product did not work at all. For the price, I find it expensive considering it does not adequately work to eliminate razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Great solution to help with redness and razor bumps. Apply it quickly after shaving with a cotton ball or cloth. Has like a tea smell to it. Works pretty good. Im medium skin and have issues with cystic acne so it helps a bit to clean the skin</li>
    <li> I am usually one of those people who read reviews before I buy a product but I never review products myself. I had to say something about this product. This is a great product and I would buy it over and over again. I used to hate shaving so much because I get a lot of ingrown hairs especially in the underarms. I have used this product continuously for a few months and it works. My underarms have cleared up and I have no problems with ingrown hair anymore. Even if I see a few I just use this product and Voila! after a few days all gone....</li>
    <li> I use it day and night, applying it to my face with a folded tissue. I have noticed a dramatic decrease of razor bumps where they usually occurred on the outer sides of my neck. Looking forward to a consistently bump free neck!</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty good, but I do have to warn you that it does burn a little and takes some time to dry.</li>
    <li> this did not help at all</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. My brother who is a barber recommended it to me and said it was the best out there. I often shave my head and sometimes i get razor/hair bumps that normally last for weeks. After 2 days the bumps were gone. I use it every time I shave now and I have no problems. This bottle has lasted me for about 4 months.</li>
    <li> Does a decent job if you commit to the regime... apparently I&#x27;m incapable of managing to use the stuff twice a day - BUT, when I do it works good. I bought an atomizer and it worked okay. I just started using those cosmetic cotton pads and they do a good job applying it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It works! It might take a couple of weeks but it will definitely get rid of unsightly razor bumps. It stinks but you will get use to it. Also I would advise buying the roll on so you don&#x27;t waste so much in the cotton It does burn too but not more than aftershave lotion,</li>
    <li> Works great and a great product.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use the product. Me for my bikini area and him for his face. We love it.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I will make your skin peel a bit, which i think is a good thing because it make your dead skin disappear and will cause your hair ingrown to come out of the skin.  Of course you can prevent over peeling by using your moisturizer and lotion.  use gloves though as it cause your fingers to crinkle and peel too much.</li>
    <li> This product works as described , ive been using this for yrs , i took a break off it for awhile ,and i paid the price by getting out of control bumps . I will be ordering this product again , Thanks !</li>
    <li> I was using another (very popular) razor bump treatment and it was not working.  So while cleaning my make up drawer I found Skin Tight and thought what do I have to loose.  I was amazed after a couple of days via the directions given, my razor bump are gone.  I just could not believe it.  I will try some of their other product.  Glad I did not throw it away.</li>
    <li> Good product and does sting a little and dry out treated area a bit. So make sure to moisturize after.</li>
    <li> This really gets rid of the razor bumps. I use it for razor bumps below the belt so I can&#x27;t really speak to how well it might work for your face or for women, their legs. My only complaint is at first the smell isn&#x27;t all that great but it does go away.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product years ago when I was at Wal-Mart looking for a solution to my razor bump issue. Right after I bought it, the store stopped carrying it. So I turned to Amazon. This works great when used regularly.</li>
    <li> Worked very well for my teenage son.  Going to purchase another bottle and gift it to my younger brother.</li>
    <li> This works well however it is a bit strong smelling at first. The smell doesn&#x27;t stay with you which is good.</li>
    <li> Super effective. I used to have bumps that could have been mistaken for pimples or warts due to coarse hair and shaving frequently. Lots of in grown hairs. I tried various other products before resorting to this one. I have no noticeable bumps any longer. I do have to use the product everyday, but it is not overly smelly. Ow! it does sting and should be applied after getting right out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Hands down best ingrown hair product - stuff really works. Every time I get one I use this product and it goes away. If you use regularly - it won&#x27;t even happen.</li>
    <li> has a very strong sent .i didnt even notice the warning of Birth defects til now :-(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered since my first shave with ingrown hairs, razor bumps, irritation and sensitivity. Over the years I have found products that improved the health of my face and neck, but nothing that pulled it all together to give my skin that healthful smoothness. Using a single blade safety razor helped a little, switching to non-foamy shaving cream helped a lot, careful prep helped a little, Extra Strength \\&quot;BumpStopper2\\&quot; helped a little more, and proper technique helped even more. I still however, had my regular affliction of redness and blemishes along a line across my throat and along my jaw bone until I wet a cotton ball with SkinTight Extra strength, endured the sting, and repeated for a week. When I swapped out the blade in my razor 7 days later, I inspected my face and neck. Absolutely smooth and entirely healthy was what I found the condition of my skin to be. For some, a great comfortable shave is just a 5 blade articulating, vibrating machine away. For those who suffer the real problem of Razor bumps and irritation, you owe it to yourself to TRY SKIN TIGHT!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend cause we can only find the small bottles at Sally Beauty Supply. He loves this product. It soothe his skin and keep it bump free. I wish they had this product years ago when I was stationed in Germany because the male soldiers had to get a shaving profile. Their face had so many bumps from shaving and nothing helped.</li>
    <li> Look like it works but I need more time use this for be sure and in this moment&lt;br /&gt;the time I use like 1 week dont feel any side effect , come on time</li>
    <li> Good product, good shipping</li>
    <li> This product does help with the razor bumps that you get after shaving and it also helps with itching when hair is growing back. I would recommend this for people that have sensitive skin after shaving. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell it&#x27;s a little strong.</li>
    <li> I am using this for the razor bumps I have under my neck, and it was working fairly well for the first week or so. I have decided to stop using it because it is drying out my skin terribly, I am literally having to wake up and moisturize or scrub off the dryness and flakes that it leaves. Due to it drying out my skin so bad now, it has reduced it&#x27;s effectiveness, my razor bumps are more irritated. This product says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, but my sensitive skin does not agree with it.</li>
    <li> Ever since my barber introduced me to this stuff, it&#x27;s been a constant in my shaving regimen. Does it sting?  Yeah, it&#x27;s an astringent so that&#x27;s expected.  This product is great for keeping razor bumps in check and that was worth buying some more.</li>
