### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great toothpaste recommended from our dentist.  </li>
      <li>Good Toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>So, I located some information on Crest&#x27;s own website:    </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even want to know what kind of ingredient/chemical is causing the skin to peel off.  </li>
      <li>We also experienced a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; sensation on the under part of the tongue, it seems to stick to the bottom of your mouth even if you are adequately hydrated.  </li>
      <li>I have never had more than one canker sore in my mouth at a time in my life.</li>
      <li>Love Crest.</li>
      <li>Pepsodent is better.</li>
      <li>We love this toothpaste a lot.</li>
      <li>I love Crest toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>It already feels a lot better than it has done</li>
      <li>mentioned, this toothpaste was fine for a week or two.</li>
      <li>Received as Christmas present and caused great sensitivity pain.</li>
      <li>Publix had this on sale, buy one get one free.</li>
      <li>I have since switched to Aquafresh Advanced (five stars)...</li>
      <li>It whitened my teeth right away and love the clean, taste it leaves in mouth for hours.  </li>
      <li>I have always liked Crest products, but it seems that this one in particular has some problems.  </li>
      <li>It seemed okay at first, so I didn&#x27;t bother replacing my Sensodyne.</li>
      <li>A new kind of adhesive??</li>
      <li>And it leaves my mouth feeling tortured and slimy rather than refreshed and squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>And my mouth and breath never tastes fresh and clean with this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to eat anything more than vanilla ice cream, milk, and white bread for 4 days now.</li>
      <li>I was getting gingivitis from using Organic, all natural toothpaste, so against my better judgement, I bought \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothpaste and tried Crest ProHealth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong like other toothpastes, but it is still able to clean my teeth.  </li>
      <li>I noticed right away, about an hour after I brush</li>
      <li>I was able to brush the sore softly without it stinging too much.</li>
      <li>besides, I can get a nice clean mouth without the mouth pain and dead skin that I get with this sucky product.</li>
      <li>Bought a tube of Crest Pro Health after using the small size to carry on a plane and short trip, and was impressed how it cleaned my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
      <li>So glad I&#x27;m not the only one who had this problem.</li>
      <li>though the company may claim that it&#x27;s good to get rid of dead layers of skin</li>
      <li>If this is the way they put out a flagship product, what kind of quality should we expect from their other products?  </li>
      <li>If a product is strong enough to do that...</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just super powerful antibacterial stuff, I actually find myself having yuckier breath in the morning...</li>
      <li>Just recently a crest and oral b rep brought several full sized tubes to the office for the staff and after my colgate total (which i loved) ran out</li>
      <li>It seems iffy enough, to probably avoid this product, until it has been around for a few more years and more problems are noticed.    </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really experience the &amp;#34;slime&amp;#34</li>
      <li>My Dentist gave me a sample of Crest Pro-something can&#x27;t really call it health.</li>
      <li>I wonder if I can throw it in the trash or is it considered hazardous waste.</li>
      <li>only really connected the sore with the toothpaste today when I decided to get some more of my regular Sensodyne, and man was it a difference.</li>
      <li>So I tried another Crest product: Crest Complete Deep Clean.</li>
      <li>Using this product make my mouth slough-off into some kind of discussing unctious slime that is hard to remove.</li>
      <li>; I have seen mentioned a lot here, but that&#x27;s possibly because I use mouthwash right after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel self concious about it even right after brushing, as if I hadn&#x27;t brushed at all!</li>
      <li>My dentist said it could have been an a reaction to a new toothpaste, and bingo</li>
      <li>The cleaning action of both Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste and Crest Pro-Health Rinse can accelerate this process and often results in the skin coming off in sheets, making the removal of dead skin cells more noticeable.\\&quot;    </li>
      <li>I am not usually picky about which toothpaste I buy, but I can say with 100% certainty that I will never buy this product again.</li>
      <li>perhaps it was just me, so I asked my wife if she&#x27;d had problems as well, and she is having the EXACT same issue of toothpain(extreme sensitivity).&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will certainly never use it again, and I have been a loyal Crest user since childhood.</li>
      <li>I thought I just had really super sensitive teeth or something, but looking through the other reviews</li>
      <li>I had been attributing my problems to my surgery, but eventually I realized that my surgery was completely healed and through a process of elimination</li>
      <li>If you have to go to the dentist to get it off of your teeth per the other reviews it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so disappointed too, because I bough this toothpaste specifically because it&#x27;s more of a gel than a paste, and works better with Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>If anyone knows how to reverse the effects or how long it takes to heal after using this stuff, please let me know, because it&#x27;s really beginning to scare me.</li>
      <li>Initially I blamed a new toothbrush, but from the rest of the reviews I think I can conclude this was another side effect of the paste.  </li>
      <li>Despite using Orajel, it continued getting worse and is now a nice white dot of pain.</li>
      <li>A half hour after the first use it was like someone shoved a jellyfish in my mouth.</li>
      <li>I was even more appalled to Google the symptoms and find THOUSANDS of hits, each with THOUSANDS of the same complaints, many indicating P&amp;G denying any such problem exists.  </li>

<li> A half hour after the first use it was like someone shoved a jellyfish in my mouth.</li>
<li> I was even more appalled to Google the symptoms and find THOUSANDS of hits, each with THOUSANDS of the same complaints, many indicating P&amp;G denying any such problem exists.  </li>
<li> After 2 weeks of using this my mouth was dry, raw, my taste buds felt inflamed, and my mouth burns when I eat certain foods.  </li>
<li> It took me a really long time to determine that this toothpaste is what causes the mouth slime/scum/film in my mouth.  </li>
<li> I find myself brushing faster just to get it out because it strips off all the layers of skin in my mouth and gives me sores if I leave it in there too long.</li>
<li> Yeah, there&#x27;s the skin sloughing off on the inside of my mouth like everyone else, but that&#x27;s just the minor stuff.  </li>
<li> After using the whitening version of this product for two weeks by cheeks and inside of lower lip became red and rough.</li>
<li> The shedding that you have noticed in your mouth is not unsafe and is a result of the natural process to remove dead cells from the skin surfaces in your mouth.</li>
<li> Suddenly I developed a sore area on the small web of skin/muscle that connects the bottom lip area to the bottom gum.</li>
<li> P&amp;G should be shut down by the FDA for such a damaging product.</li>
<li> I called him up over a week later and said I still felt an odd taste in my mouth</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve other toothpastes that have caused rashes around my lips, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
<li> /&gt;There is something in this toothpaste that is harmful, and CREST you know about itj!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you, do a search on the internet and there are a lot of people having the same problem, even worse such as swollen gums and lips.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
<li> I started using the free pro health I got from our rep. Bad idea</li>
<li> This product literally makes my teeth hurt, all of them, with the added benefit of removing a layer of skin from the inside of your mouth leaving you with white, slimey mouth scum.</li>
<li> I used this stuff for less than a week before the pain made me stop.  </li>
<li> I will have to think long and hard before trying a P&amp;G product ever again.</li>
<li> and I didn&#x27;t enjoy the food at a wedding today because of it :(   </li>
<li> but my mouth is still a mess after 2 days of non-use.</li>
<li> Hot, Cold, it doesn&#x27;t matter, it even happens when chewing crackers.&lt;br /&gt;Thought</li>
<li> I spend a half hour in the morning, after brushing, getting the slime out of my mouth or it gums up into yucky little blobs.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s now been two weeks since I quit using it and the sides of my tongue are still raw and swollen, my gums (especially around the edges of my teeth) still burn, throb, and ache constantly, my teeth have become very sensitive, and there&#x27;s a bloody, metallic taste in my mouth all the time.  </li>
<li> I am not sure which chemical does this, but I am not interested in buying this toothpaste again.  </li>
<li> Plaque build-up increased, teeth did not fill as clean, and the stuff left my mouth feeling uncomfortable (weird) and painfully sensitive to cold liquids for 1 or 2 hours.  </li>
<li> I started noticed the slimy film in my mouth again and actually took the time this go around to google it only to find out its not a residue left behind from the paste, but the skin in my mouth peeling off?!?!!</li>
<li> I understand it might be dead skin cells.</li>
<li> The Crest Pro Health reps came and talked to my class in dental hygiene school a few years ago.</li>
<li> these past few days.&lt;br</li>
<li> Be careful!!!!</li>
<li> My mouth feels cleaner than ever, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal.\\</li>
<li> Yep, I came here to write a review about the weird shedding of my inner cheek lining.  </li>
<li> I shook it off thinking it was just a residue left from the tooth paste and stopped using it to avoid the uncomfortable after math of using the product.</li>
<li> , I&#x27;d start getting these weird stringy, white , globules stuck to the insides of my lips.</li>
<li> For awhile I thought there was something wrong with my gums/teeth, but I finally figured out</li>
<li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT, it is apparently defective, and probably dangerous IMHO.</li>
<li> I am going to call Crest and leave a formal complaint.</li>
<li> It sucks the moisture from your tissues.</li>
<li> It left the inside of my mouth feeling numb and dehydrated.  </li>
<li> After using this product for four weeks, I developed terrible brown \\&quot;stains\\&quot; - actually, some sort of brown deposit, on my teeth.  </li>
<li> Almost as bad as Arm &amp; Hammer tarter control (which leaves you with dry tight lips).</li>
<li> I was mortified and ill be sure to discuss this with the doctor and have our office no longer recommend this horrible product.</li>
<li> The after-brush food tasting horrible experience lasts far longer than any other toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
<li> I too have a strange coating inside my mouth and there is an aftertaste that lingers and really is unpleasant.</li>
<li> but it leaves an awful aftertaste, which ruins the flavor of food for several hours.</li>
<li> Still a rip-off, I threw the two tubes away after three days.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So glad I&#x27;m not the only one who had this problem. I noticed right away, about an hour after I brush, I&#x27;d start getting these weird stringy, white , globules stuck to the insides of my lips. I&#x27;d spend ten minutes trying to pull them all off. DISGUSTING. I&#x27;m so disappointed too, because I bough this toothpaste specifically because it&#x27;s more of a gel than a paste, and works better with Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> They must only test this on lab rats. A half hour after the first use it was like someone shoved a jellyfish in my mouth. Publix had this on sale, buy one get one free. Still a rip-off, I threw the two tubes away after three days. Probably should have called HAZMAT to haul it away rather than dump it in the landfill.</li>
    <li> No drama here, this toothpaste does literally peel off a thin layer on all gum surfaces, and it peels off in a slime.  I spend a half hour in the morning, after brushing, getting the slime out of my mouth or it gums up into yucky little blobs.  Two months ago I had 4 impacted wisdom teeth removed and at the same time I happened to buy Crest Pro Health.  I had been attributing my problems to my surgery, but eventually I realized that my surgery was completely healed and through a process of elimination, it was the Crest Pro Health.  My husband is always complaining that my breath smells like chemicals and he was concerned that my surgeon had left something \\&quot;medical\\&quot; in my gums! But that is not the case.    I have always liked Crest products, but it seems that this one in particular has some problems.  I don&#x27;t even want to know what kind of ingredient/chemical is causing the skin to peel off.  It seems iffy enough, to probably avoid this product, until it has been around for a few more years and more problems are noticed.    I have not noticed any staining, but I also do not have any plaque on my teeth at this time.    And my mouth and breath never tastes fresh and clean with this toothpaste.  I feel self concious about it even right after brushing, as if I hadn&#x27;t brushed at all!</li>
    <li> tears up the inside of my mouth. I find myself brushing faster just to get it out because it strips off all the layers of skin in my mouth and gives me sores if I leave it in there too long. though the company may claim that it&#x27;s good to get rid of dead layers of skin and it&#x27;s just super powerful antibacterial stuff, I actually find myself having yuckier breath in the morning... besides, I can get a nice clean mouth without the mouth pain and dead skin that I get with this sucky product.</li>
    <li> Using this product make my mouth slough-off into some kind of discussing unctious slime that is hard to remove. A new kind of adhesive?? Don&#x27;t buy this product unless prepared for this effect.</li>
    <li> It took me a really long time to determine that this toothpaste is what causes the mouth slime/scum/film in my mouth.  But, I didn&#x27;t want to just speculate.  So, I located some information on Crest&#x27;s own website:    \\&quot;Q: Since using Pro-Health toothpaste, I&#x27;ve noticed a \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; of the lining of my mouth. It is like a layer peels off each time I use it. My mouth feels cleaner than ever, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal.\\&quot;    \\&quot;A: The shedding that you have noticed in your mouth is not unsafe and is a result of the natural process to remove dead cells from the skin surfaces in your mouth. The cleaning action of both Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste and Crest Pro-Health Rinse can accelerate this process and often results in the skin coming off in sheets, making the removal of dead skin cells more noticeable.\\&quot;    [...]    I&#x27;ve been using Crest for the majority of my life and have had almost zero cavities.  So, I&#x27;ll continue buying Crest, but I will NOT be buying &#x27;Pro Health&#x27; any longer.</li>
    <li> After 2 days of using this product both my husband and I have burning sensations on our tongues. I got the worst of the deal with swollen membranes throughout my mouth and under my tongue. We also experienced a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; sensation on the under part of the tongue, it seems to stick to the bottom of your mouth even if you are adequately hydrated.  We racked our brains for foods we both ate or drank and then my husband realised that we had just changed our toothpaste. We have stopped using it but my mouth is still a mess after 2 days of non-use. I am going to call Crest and leave a formal complaint.</li>
    <li> Had a coupon to purchase 2 of these for the price of one, brought 2 tubes home.  1 and 3/4 of the tubes are now in my county land fill.  Plaque build-up increased, teeth did not fill as clean, and the stuff left my mouth feeling uncomfortable (weird) and painfully sensitive to cold liquids for 1 or 2 hours.  Not something I&#x27;ll purchase again in this lifetime.</li>
    <li> My Dentist gave me a sample of Crest Pro-something can&#x27;t really call it health. I read the ingredients and even the statement on the box says that stannous fluoride stains your teeth.  After reading the reviews I&#x27;m definately avoiding the mouth slime and teeth staining. If you have to go to the dentist to get it off of your teeth per the other reviews it isn&#x27;t worth it. I&#x27;m not waiting until I get sloughing of the mouth just like Chemotherapy that also cause slouthing of the mouth. I wonder if I can throw it in the trash or is it considered hazardous waste.</li>
    <li> I was getting gingivitis from using Organic, all natural toothpaste, so against my better judgement, I bought \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothpaste and tried Crest ProHealth. Well, for about the 4th time since I started using it, my mouth became very raw and painful. I thought my tongue was burning while brushing my teeth b/c of whatever \\&quot;rash\\&quot; or something, I had. HOW could I not realize that it was the toothpaste causing it???? My mouth hurts so bad and I didn&#x27;t enjoy the food at a wedding today because of it :(   I will never buy this crap again, or any other Crest product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought Crest Pro Health Clinical gum protection and soon thereafter I get painful sores in my mouth and stop the toothpaste. I switched to sensodyne (five stars) and the sores healed. A couple of months later I go to the dentist...its cavity and root canal time. I thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t the toothpaste. So I tried another Crest product: Crest Complete Deep Clean. I called him up over a week later and said I still felt an odd taste in my mouth so I didn&#x27;t think it was healing properly. My mouth was getting more sensitive to cold liquids and the taste in my mouth was worse than ever before. He said, \\&quot;Your mouth is totally healed. Change your toothpaste, that&#x27;s probably it\\&quot; (I did not tell him which product I used.) I have since switched to Aquafresh Advanced (five stars)...painful sensitivity gone after two days of use, slimy taste is noticeably less. I will never try another Crest toothpaste.</li>
    <li> After using the whitening version of this product for two weeks by cheeks and inside of lower lip became red and rough. The next day white \\&quot;canker sore\\&quot; eruptions occurred throughout my mouth. I have never had more than one canker sore in my mouth at a time in my life. My dentist said it could have been an a reaction to a new toothpaste, and bingo, I knew it was this stuff. HORRIBLE! I haven&#x27;t been able to eat anything more than vanilla ice cream, milk, and white bread for 4 days now. The pain is horrible and unrelenting. No over the counter remedies are helping, and I&#x27;ve purchased them all. Similar reports are all over the internet. Be careful!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this for 3 days in a row, and each time, it hurts my teeth like hell. I thought I just had really super sensitive teeth or something, but looking through the other reviews, I see I&#x27;m not the only one with this problem. I switched from Sensodine Whitening, and never had that problem before.</li>
    <li> Bought a tube of Crest Pro Health after using the small size to carry on a plane and short trip, and was impressed how it cleaned my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, after 2 weeks of using it, I am experiencing deep pain9EXTREME SENSITIVITY) in ALL my teeth during and after eating. Hot, Cold, it doesn&#x27;t matter, it even happens when chewing crackers.&lt;br /&gt;Thought perhaps it was just me, so I asked my wife if she&#x27;d had problems as well, and she is having the EXACT same issue of toothpain(extreme sensitivity).&lt;br /&gt;Never had this problem during years and years of using COLGATE TOTAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something in this toothpaste that is harmful, and CREST you know about itj!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you, do a search on the internet and there are a lot of people having the same problem, even worse such as swollen gums and lips.&lt;br /&gt;What the heck are you putting in.&lt;br /&gt;You NEED TO PULL THIS product TODAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God forbid how children are feeling, and parents not knowing what is wrong and then have the expense of visits to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!! MINE IS IN THE TRASH, I HOPE NO ANIMALS TOUCH IT.</li>
    <li> This product leaves a weird &#x27;slime&#x27; in your mouth after brushing. For awhile I thought there was something wrong with my gums/teeth, but I finally figured out it was Crest Pro-Health that was causing it! Gross. I am not usually picky about which toothpaste I buy, but I can say with 100% certainty that I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> After using this product for four weeks, I developed terrible brown \\&quot;stains\\&quot; - actually, some sort of brown deposit, on my teeth.  I tried whitening products, but nothing would take those stains off.  I was at the dentist today.  Both the dentist and the hygenist told my that Crest Pro Health caused those stains.  It took the hygenist an entire hour to get them off of my teeth.  This product should be pulled from the shelves.</li>
    <li> The Crest Pro Health reps came and talked to my class in dental hygiene school a few years ago. The reason for the mouth slime is the stannous fluoride in the toothpaste (which can also cause staining). It sucks the moisture from your tissues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health for several years now, and have had white film and mouth sores almost every day. Thinking it was just a residue from the toothpaste, and sores from a possible nervous habit. I was shocked and appalled when my dentist identified the sloughing of skin, due to this toothpaste! I was even more appalled to Google the symptoms and find THOUSANDS of hits, each with THOUSANDS of the same complaints, many indicating P&amp;G denying any such problem exists.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT, it is apparently defective, and probably dangerous IMHO. P&amp;G should be shut down by the FDA for such a damaging product. I will certainly never use it again, and I have been a loyal Crest user since childhood. I will have to think long and hard before trying a P&amp;G product ever again. If this is the way they put out a flagship product, what kind of quality should we expect from their other products?  I also found out that this \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; product actually has been CAUSING the brown staining of my teeth. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of using this my mouth was dry, raw, my taste buds felt inflamed, and my mouth burns when I eat certain foods.  I&#x27;ve never had any of these problems before.  Do a search for \\&quot;crest pro health toothpaste problems\\&quot; and you will see hundreds of similar problems posted.  Crest is an evil company for selling such a harmful product.</li>
    <li> I started using my husband&#x27;s toothpaste (the product listed on this page) when my Sensodyne Repair and Protect ran out. It seemed okay at first, so I didn&#x27;t bother replacing my Sensodyne. What a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, this toothpaste was fine for a week or two. Suddenly I developed a sore area on the small web of skin/muscle that connects the bottom lip area to the bottom gum. Despite using Orajel, it continued getting worse and is now a nice white dot of pain. Brushing my teeth with this Crest toothpaste was like applying acid to this area and it made me procrastinate about brushing my teeth altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only really connected the sore with the toothpaste today when I decided to get some more of my regular Sensodyne, and man was it a difference. I was able to brush the sore softly without it stinging too much. It already feels a lot better than it has done these past few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really experience the &amp;#34;slime&amp;#34; I have seen mentioned a lot here, but that&#x27;s possibly because I use mouthwash right after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, would not recommend this to anyone who values their gums.</li>
    <li> Received as Christmas present and caused great sensitivity pain. It&#x27;s been several days, and I now need to see a dentist to figure out how to stop the pain. This toothpaste should come with a warning label.</li>
    <li> Yeah, there&#x27;s the skin sloughing off on the inside of my mouth like everyone else, but that&#x27;s just the minor stuff.  There are much worse effects and they aren&#x27;t going away.  I used this stuff for less than a week before the pain made me stop.  After only three days, it was like brushing my teeth with battery acid.  It&#x27;s now been two weeks since I quit using it and the sides of my tongue are still raw and swollen, my gums (especially around the edges of my teeth) still burn, throb, and ache constantly, my teeth have become very sensitive, and there&#x27;s a bloody, metallic taste in my mouth all the time.  I&#x27;m afraid this toothpaste from hell has caused permanent damage.  If anyone knows how to reverse the effects or how long it takes to heal after using this stuff, please let me know, because it&#x27;s really beginning to scare me.</li>
    <li> I constantly have canker sores all over my pallet, gums, and tongue as well as the slime everyone is talking about! Terrible product, I will never buy this stuff again.</li>
    <li> I used this toothpaste for a couple weeks.  It left the inside of my mouth feeling numb and dehydrated.  I also got big gobs of disgusting slime in my mouth each morning.  Initially I blamed a new toothbrush, but from the rest of the reviews I think I can conclude this was another side effect of the paste.  Yuck.</li>
    <li> Good Toothpaste.  It whitened my teeth right away and love the clean, taste it leaves in mouth for hours.  Never had any bad, side effects (thank God!) and have been using it everyday, for months.</li>
    <li> I love Crest toothpaste.  It&#x27;s not too strong like other toothpastes, but it is still able to clean my teeth.  I&#x27;ve other toothpastes that have caused rashes around my lips, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that.  It gets my teeth as naturally white as teeth should be.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> After reading a comparative review of toothpaste in Men&#x27;s Health, I decided to purchase this but have taken it back after one use.  I too have a strange coating inside my mouth and there is an aftertaste that lingers and really is unpleasant. The after-brush food tasting horrible experience lasts far longer than any other toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste recommended from our dentist.  There is an obvious difference felt after brushing teeth. We love this toothpaste a lot.</li>
    <li> yes i too have had the mouth slime. I understand it might be dead skin cells. But even if you use it for months, the mouth slime still happens. Imagine kissing someone and then they get your strings of mouth slime on their lips. Its disgusting. Wont be using again.</li>
    <li> Yep, I came here to write a review about the weird shedding of my inner cheek lining.  If a product is strong enough to do that...I probably don&#x27;t want it sitting in my mouth all night.  I am not sure which chemical does this, but I am not interested in buying this toothpaste again.  How is this still on the market?!</li>
    <li> After brushing, it causes the inner layer of skin inside my cheeks and inner lips to sluff off. It feels disgusting and disturbing. Not only that, but it leaves an awful aftertaste, which ruins the flavor of food for several hours. And it leaves my mouth feeling tortured and slimy rather than refreshed and squeaky clean. Love Crest. HATE Crest Pro-Health.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve heard it before, if I could give it no stars, I would. The worst toothpaste....ever. Almost as bad as Arm &amp; Hammer tarter control (which leaves you with dry tight lips). This product literally makes my teeth hurt, all of them, with the added benefit of removing a layer of skin from the inside of your mouth leaving you with white, slimey mouth scum. Really disgusting, I&#x27;m never buying another Crest product again. $.99 Pepsodent is better.</li>
    <li> I actually work in a dental office and had noticed the slime after using some of the samples my office recieved. I shook it off thinking it was just a residue left from the tooth paste and stopped using it to avoid the uncomfortable after math of using the product. Just recently a crest and oral b rep brought several full sized tubes to the office for the staff and after my colgate total (which i loved) ran out I started using the free pro health I got from our rep. Bad idea I started noticed the slimy film in my mouth again and actually took the time this go around to google it only to find out its not a residue left behind from the paste, but the skin in my mouth peeling off?!?!! I was mortified and ill be sure to discuss this with the doctor and have our office no longer recommend this horrible product.</li>
    <li> The stupid flip-cap on this toothpaste &amp; the sticky, drooling, aqua-colored slime inside the tube combine to create a mess when it leaks out nightly on to your bathroom shelf!</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the grit in the toothpaste, then disgusted by the awful aftertaste. How can they get away with marketing this awful stuff? I&#x27;ll never buy a Crest product again.</li>
