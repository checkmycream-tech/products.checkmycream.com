      <li>Excellent source of Aloe Vera which is essential for clear, soft skin.</li>
      <li>This Aloe cream goes on smooth and really helps make the skin smoth.</li>
      <li>But we thought it was worth trying the demo size.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item from a convention thinking its all natural and safe and checked the reviews.</li>
      <li>Also shipping came in pretty quick and had no problems with the process of delivery.</li>
      <li>My skin soaks it up instantly, I love the slight brown rice, natural non-scented kind</li>
      <li>This is most definitely a staple in my skin care routine from here on in.</li>
      <li>but it is bargin compared to other products which are not as effective.</li>
      <li>After using it at home for a few days I noticed my face looked great, I am in my mid 30s and</li>
      <li>shared this with my uncle who absolutely loves the feel</li>
      <li>I really have to watch what I put on my skin because I&#x27;m very prone to break outs, but this moisturizer has cleared my skin as well as brightened it.</li>

      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This really soaks in to your skin and does not feel greasy at all.  I can even use it on my hands when I am typing for ours and handling paperwork without getting it on everything.  The fragranced lotion is a little too flowery smelling for me, but the fragrance free smells a little funny, so I like to mix them half and half.  Then the floral smell isn&#x27;t so strong and it covers the ingredients smell of the fragrance free.  Recommend to everyone.  I use it all over including a light coat on my face.</li>
    <li> HAVE ONLY USED IT A FEW TIMES BUT SEEMS TO BE WORKING VERY WELL</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle. I am a man and I work outdoors a lot. My hands get rough and dry out, especially in winter. I can coat my hands with Infinite Aloe and the next morning they are usually healed. Sometime if they are really bad, I have to apply twice. What is neat about this is it soaks right in to the skin immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin slick or oily feeling (men don&#x27;t like lotions that do this). Really good product, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  Excellent source of Aloe Vera which is essential for clear, soft skin. I use it as a night cream also.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks before writing a review to see if I had any reactions. Well, I have to say-I am in love with Infinite Aloe. I really have to watch what I put on my skin because I&#x27;m very prone to break outs, but this moisturizer has cleared my skin as well as brightened it. I usually have very dry, flaky skin during the winter months, and it completely eliminated that as well! I use it as my night cream, and I wake up every morning with a healthy, dewy fresh complexion.  I also had a major bruise on my leg from a fall, and decided to try Infinite Aloe on it, and I swear it was just about gone in two days. This is most definitely a staple in my skin care routine from here on in.</li>
    <li> Purchase this at a home show.  Used it for 3months.  Nothing improved.  I was hoping for something.  I know all skins are different but I would think it would help some area.  For me I wasted money.  Can&#x27;t return it since woman didn&#x27;t give me a receipt and I didn&#x27;t notice that until I was home. No sticker on container either.</li>
    <li> It was okay not what I expected</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works wonders, absorbs quickly it is sort of a &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; which is great! non greasy at all which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years, it does the trick.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from a convention thinking its all natural and safe and checked the reviews. Only used twice burned my hands like putting it on the stove. I went to the emergency room and they thought I burned my hands from boiling water or stove burn the nurse was scared to touch the sample bottle. I really didn&#x27;t blame her after what happened with me. Will never purchase this and whom ever does be careful.</li>
    <li> shared this with my uncle who absolutely loves the feel</li>
    <li> The product was not satisfactory poor quality and not very much aloe compared to other products.  aloe farms is better.  I returned half of this order and still have not gotten a refund</li>
    <li> It works well but stinks to high heaven! Gives me a headache</li>
    <li> I work outside,exposure to changing elements part of my life. I also have roscea with dry scaley skin, this cream is the first treatment that I see improvement with. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This sounded like a good product on paper.  I wash my hands frequently and they are dry.  I thought the aloe might be therapeutic.  Instead I find this greasy and makes my hands feel even drier.  I would not order again.</li>
    <li> With my dry skin &amp;#34;condition,&amp;#34; this is the absolute BEST product for me.  My skin soaks it up instantly, I love the slight brown rice, natural non-scented kind and it keeps my skin healthy!  Other &amp;#34;ultra moisture&amp;#34; lotions make my skin &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m outside in our humidity.  Not this product.  I have repurchased it many times and will continue to do so.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to a number of family and friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this Fragrance Free version at one of the Costco &amp;#34;special events.&amp;#34; The original scented kind seemed like a light scent, but I&#x27;m sensitive in general so I bought fragrance free. The rep holds the tub to your face.. and yes, there is no odor. Something happens when it contacts your skin, though. Really gross smell. It kept waking me up that first night! The best description I could come up with: like cereal and milk that have been fermenting in a bowl for a few hours. However, my skin felt really good with the product on it. I really wanted to like it. Took it back. Now I&#x27;m here to try the scented version.</li>
    <li> only product I use on my skin</li>
    <li> This stuff helps reduce redness.  It is good for the skin and has some nice essential oils in it.  Regular Aloe Vera is also good for the skin but will be sticky compared to using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/17/14&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use this product as it contains dimethicone in it which clogs pores for me.</li>
    <li> This cream smells terrible, like yeast. I exchanged it for the original scent.</li>
    <li> Infinite skin cream makes your skin so soft even after one use works good also on your hands, I will be back for more!</li>
    <li> It worked great but I do not like the smell...it smells like vegetables to me.</li>
    <li> And given the price, definitely would not buy again.  It has not helped the dry skin on my hands at all.  I did find it helpful for my face, though.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this and you wouldn&#x27;t buy it if you saw her hands!&lt;br /&gt;They were red like she burned them on the stove and dried out instantly.&lt;br /&gt;she only used it twice :/</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Have used it for years for very dry skin.  Does a good job as an after shave skin conditioner.</li>
    <li> My husband and I were shocked when this product actually cleared up the facial psoriasis and eczema he has fought with for years. We purchased a demo size at a district fair exhibit, and didn&#x27;t hope for much. You know how those exhibits are -- big promises, and no real warranty if the product doesn&#x27;t work.  But we thought it was worth trying the demo size. Well, it works! My husband&#x27;s face and forehead have never looked better.  If you have eczema or psoriasis you have to give this a try -- it works better than all the prescription ointments he has used in over 40 years of treatment.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am a product skincare junkie.  I love cosmetics and skincare products (see all my reviews).  I was at my local Sam&#x27;s club and was approached by a salesman about this product.  It was winter and I always have very dry skin in the cold months hands and face. I had the choice of scented (jasmine or unscented) he put the jasmine on my hand and I thought it smelled horrible.  I liked the way it felt but did not like the smell.  My son also has dry skin and he is very sensitive with lotions.  I decided to buy a jar but the unscented one.  After using it at home for a few days I noticed my face looked great, I am in my mid 30s and my biggest problem my pores were shrinking!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  My skin felt great and I totally saw a difference. I did begin to hate the smell of the unscented variety.  I ended up ordering some in the scented and a limited edition musk scent I found online.  That one is my favorite smell.  The cream it self is light weight and non-greasy.  It makes my face feel clean once rubbed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had something work so visibly before.  I am glad I found this product!  It is expensive but the jar is huge and I use it everywhere feet, legs, face!  It works great!</li>
    <li> If you like greaseless skincare products and if you like the smell of oatmeal or fresh cooked bread on your hands, you will love this product. It has a very organic smell. I personally love it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Product works very well for me, I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I wear it day and night, all over my face and body . Best time to use it is right away after you shower. It leaves the skin Soft. But I do recommend if your planning to go outside put this first let it dry then wear sunblock lotion , because this is not SPF.</li>
    <li> Quite possibly the best body lotion I have ever used. It&#x27;s creamy and absorbs into your skin very quickly. Not at all greasy or waxy which is an issue I commonly find with lots of other lotions. Plus, the mini containers are great for travel and can be refilled as needed for multiple use.</li>
    <li> This has been a great product to use for extremely dry skin. The product was well packaged and delivery as promised. I wish the price was lower but it is bargin compared to other products which are not as effective.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. Best one I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot</li>
    <li> Really great moisturizer! Love it , i put it on every morning and night. It&#x27;s great and keep my skin soft and smooth. Also shipping came in pretty quick and had no problems with the process of delivery. This product will last you a long time and also I&#x27;ve been noticing improvements with my face ever since I have been using this product.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis on my face and very dry skin on my feet and legs.  This is the best cream I have found to sooth and restore my skin in both areas.  It actually makes the psoriasis sores go away in a few days.</li>
    <li> I like this cream, but it is very yeasty scented. I think I&#x27;d rather go with the original scent. At least that smell goes away as soon as you put it on. The yeasty smell sticks with you, though. The product is perfect for oily skin. It&#x27;s just enough moisture and doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny. During the winter I have to put a dab of cetaphil on the really dry parts of my face. But this moisturizer is great for overall face lotion.</li>
    <li> Great for your skin..</li>
    <li> Someone recommended that I try this cream for my psoriasis.  It is very soothing, but did not help to clear it up at all.</li>
    <li> This Aloe cream goes on smooth and really helps make the skin smoth.During the winter, my hands really get chapped from washing dishes and this cream really helps.</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail face cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 7 years and always go back when I try something new on the market. It not only moisturizer but it lighten my sun spots. It&#x27;s not a miracle cream but it does work when you use it for an extended period. I noticed my skin got better in a month. ❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> This is by far the best aloe skin cream I have ever found. I use it for after sun, skin irratations, and dry cracked fingers.  I love this cream and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed this is nothing more then a cheap cream. Do not waste your money on it. Does not do what it says and it stinks. The smell is just like a cheap cream. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Item shipped is as described. Have used this item before for dry skin. Works great.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product I live in a very dry state and this moisturizer help a lot  really like this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It works good on burns. My husband burned his hand and it was healed in a couple weeks time. It started healing and boy it completely healed in just a few days after that.</li>
