      <li>NOTHING TOO BAD OR GOOD</li>

    <li> Does not lock into the base unit.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Finally, something that works.</li>
    <li> It trims nose hair.  Yay!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son. He loves it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few over the years, and this has been my favorite</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about every type of shaving device to shave my head which I first started doing when stationed in Southeast Asia back in the Sixties. It made sesse to remove all hair during the very hot and rainy seasons,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving device is the best I&#x27;ve ever found and I got the five blade attachment as it works even better than the standard four blade one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a problem with the original recharger and called the company. They sent out a replacement and Inhave no more problems. The company is even going to let me know when they bring out a new and even better shaver but I don&#x27;t know how it could get better than the one I have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whith this shaver I can keep a smith shave, head AND face, every day and not nick myself in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomend this to anyone who wants to shave any hair off their body. It&#x27;s easy and comfortable.</li>
    <li> The trimmer attachment is all I hoped for.  It has the shaver&#x27;s power behind it and does the job quickly.</li>
    <li> A bit expensive for what it is but having used whal flat serrated blade trimmers in the past this is miles better and as it doesn&#x27;t need its own battery it is slightly less clutter and another battery less to have to replace.</li>
    <li> As I am only in my twenties, I don&#x27;t use it but my Dad surely needs it, uses it and loves it.</li>
    <li> IT IS OK... NOTHING TOO BAD OR GOOD</li>
    <li> It fell apart as soon as I opened it.  I put it back together but am not sure it is working as well as it should.  I continue to use my old one.</li>
    <li> A totally awesome add-on to an already awesome line of man-hair-care line! Truly does what it&#x27;s supposed to.. and does it well!</li>
    <li> Sorry guys . . . your main product is exceptional and for my bald head - well, soothing.  But this nose trimmer?  Doesn&#x27;t really get to the hair of things and far too bulky when you attach it to the main block.  Great idea but just not easy to handle nor effective (for my nose, that is).  Three stars for a great effort.</li>
    <li> I love it,it is the best attachment you can buy, works great and price is right.</li>
    <li> Bulky and hard to use.  Does not cut very well.</li>
    <li> This item worked well. The Skull Shaver itself was very disappointing. The ear/nose attachment works as advertised. A very expensive ear and nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Purchased this with my Bald Eagle Smart.  It worked perfectly.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Very simple and easy to use. Just attach it and go. Does not nick or cut. Feels smooth on sensitive areas of ear.</li>
    <li> I liked the way it worked, but started to fall apart in 4 months so I had to throw it away and bought a Norelco from you which I love but I didn&#x27;t keep the receipt so I didn&#x27;t bother to pursue a refund. If it were a quality product I WOULD RECOMMEND, but it was a good piece of junk that  was a very poor investment. Thanks Spence Sturgis</li>
    <li> Easy to attach and makes a clean cut.</li>
    <li> It works, but maybe not as good as I was expecting, I mean I&#x27;m not a wolf  but time in time one of to of those un pleasant hairs come out and show  in the worse moment,  you gotta try with patient catch it with this attachment, and at the end it will or sometimes I end with just a small scissor like old school, maybe it will work better of you are full of nose / ear hair ..  which I&#x27;m not and don&#x27;t want to anyhow ..</li>
    <li> This product is great compared to others.</li>
    <li> This ear/nose trimmer for the skull shaver works perfectly well, it does what is intended for.</li>
