      <li>and they said they love it..</li>
      <li>It works OK</li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s two year-old razor is better than this.</li>
      <li>It seems Amazon will do anthing to sell more, even alter customer reviews.  </li>
      <li>This razor does an outstanding job of giving a close shave.</li>
      <li>Also does not come with a cover for top like others do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for the price --- look a bit &amp;#34;frail&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>well the deadline for being able to return or refund this item was may 19th....</li>
      <li>I knew I did ok.</li>
      <li>You can pay a lot more</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>but I chose not to - am pleased with the purchase.  </li>
      <li>Love the charging station.</li>
      <li>Will buy him a better razor  from a reputable company.</li>
      <li>For my purposes, a $4 pair of mustache scissors from Walmart seems to be a much better solution.</li>
      <li>It took about a week to get used to the differences, but this Reminton is a much better shave.  </li>
      <li>Remington should look into this and correct it and engineer it to be more sturdy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull hairs and has a much better build quality.</li>
      <li>the trimmer is very handy but shaving on a whole using this shaver is lengthy.</li>
      <li>I figure that twenty years for an appliance is pretty good; so that was OK.</li>
      <li>For an electric razor it gave a pretty good shave, and I found it very easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d go with this one if you want a nicely built one you&#x27;re willing to pay considerably more for I&#x27;d go with the Norelco.</li>
      <li>The shave of this new unit is just as good or better than the Norelco.</li>
      <li>but once I realized how to just let it cut easy without pressure</li>
      <li>Handling of the shaver is easy and the unit is well designed for your hand...</li>
      <li>at zero minutes it seemed to be going strong.  </li>
      <li>I am getting very close/good shaves with it and am very pleased.</li>
      <li>this may not be true with all rotory shavers but if you look on the top of the exposed blade assembly there may be an adjustable thumb screw.  </li>
      <li>It was ok, on full charge, it lasts an hour.</li>
      <li>R8150 gives an excellent shave but not necessarily a quick one.  </li>
      <li>now it has stopped working, and i feel like it was a huge wast of money.</li>
      <li>as soon as it became available in the US</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean with running water.</li>
      <li>It looks cheap and feels cheap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as close or smooth as a blade</li>
      <li>easy to clean</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this shaver as a replacement for a Norelco that wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
      <li>Husband loves how it looks like it will be easy to clean and he like moving head</li>
      <li>Nowhere near as good as my ancient Philips/Norelco.</li>
      <li>Overall a very nice shaver.</li>
      <li>The power remaining display is very handy, my 3 minute daily shave means I can go about 3 weeks before recharging (longer when I skip days).</li>
      <li>So far after a month it seems to be quite good and really holds a charge for a long time and shaves real good</li>
      <li>Light , quick and easy.</li>
      <li>Remington says it has a 2-year warranty; however, they refuse to honor it because I do not have the original cashier&#x27;s receipt.</li>
      <li>I usually try to make the best of my less-than-stellar purchases, but I think I will make an exception for this shaver -</li>
      <li>You have to move the shaver significantly against your skin before the head moves.  </li>
      <li>- I contacted Remington and they had me send the original shaver to them.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with it, but have to see how long the baterry lasts</li>
      <li>However the workmanship is not as good as the Norelco, it shifts and makes noise as you shave whereas the Norelco is solid and moves smoothly as it goes over your face.  </li>
      <li>and it still doesn&#x27;t give him a clean shave.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for a relative as a gift because I was so pleased with my own.</li>
      <li>but my father is experiencing some difficulties in getting a close shave and also in disassembling the shaver head in order to clean it.</li>
      <li>Product works pretty good so far.</li>
      <li>It is good to have a rotary shaver back again.  </li>
      <li>Always leave me feeling smooth, and it rarely snags.</li>
      <li>I have tried several shavers and none are as good as morelco</li>
      <li>This shaver had good reviews but falls short.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with all the items I checked above.  Will be ordering two more Linksys wireless N-extenders soon.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have always bought the Remington razors because they were made very well and lasted a long time...when I bought this one on line I was disappointed because it was all PLATIC!!!</li>
    <li> Have to use shaver longer time (on) to have a smoother look. Does not clean very well so Im disliking it.</li>
    <li> Husband loves how it looks like it will be easy to clean and he like moving head</li>
    <li> Loved the product and the shipping was on time... Great work guys.</li>
    <li> not as close shave as razor, but a great time saver. I love it. easy to clean</li>
    <li> Works great. Took a little getting used to it, but after a month I&#x27;m comfortable with it. Battery lasts all of a month between charges.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a smooth glide...have to keep going over the same spots numerous times...not a close shave</li>
    <li> This was my first trip into the rotary world after using foil shavers all my shaving years.  I have always been skeptical of the design and I was not let down.  I have a travel shaver that shaves closer than this Remington R8150.  Instead of shaving the hair on my neck, it just ate my neck up.  I have returned it and will now try to find another good foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I am using my wife&#x27;s account, so this review is by a man.</li>
    <li> Works great but large number charge light flashes all night long. Also does not come with a cover for top like others do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price --- look a bit &amp;#34;frail&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Was investigating a replacement for my Remington foil razor. Never used a rotary before, but liked reviews that said a rotary works better if you have a few days beard growth. I preferred a plug in (non-battery) model because I like to put my razor away in a drawer every day, but I researched all the Remington rotary models. Ended up choosing the R8 (R8150) and have been very happy with it. The power remaining display is very handy, my 3 minute daily shave means I can go about 3 weeks before recharging (longer when I skip days). I like how the rotary doesn&#x27;t grab my multi-day growth like the foil model, and I never have to go over it with a blade razor like I needed to with the foil model after skipping a day. Found it priced around $65 at WalMart, but when I checked out, it rang up at $30. At first I thought I might have grabbed the wrong model, but it was the R8. Knowing that the replacement heads were $25, I went back a couple of weeks later and bought another R8 at $30, and now I switch when it&#x27;s time to recharge one of them.</li>
    <li> did not work up to my what I needed in a razer</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver ( Remington R-8150 ) from [...] as soon as it became available in the US ( mid August 2010 ). It was released in Europe in early July 2010. Oddly enough, inquiring about it from Remington US, I was told it was not a US model but I found and purchased it through Amazon. However, Amazon&#x27;s service has been [..], I&#x27;m very [...] about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself rectifies one key flaw of the previous (still available) R series: The combs are now attached to the head assembly and do not accidentally pop out. This also means the entire head assembly must now be replaced instead of just the cutters/combs, when the cutters get dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exterior finish is an improvement over previous models but it&#x27;s chromed plastic. No pouch comes with this package, just a shaver stand. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of shaving quality, because the heads are raised, they sometimes skip on skin. The electric motor has a high RPM which can be good and bad: long growth is easily cut but it&#x27;s considerably noisier than comparable Philips Norelco models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read my entire review (plus an unboxing and a tear-down) with pictures here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s customer service has been absolutely terrible. Item was received late and package was half torn open. Also some parts of this review has been altered and/or deleted. It seems Amazon will do anthing to sell more, even alter customer reviews.  I have written to Amazon customer service, they just don&#x27;t give a darn. Be warned, when you purchase from Amazon, you&#x27;re helping to support a company that could care less about its customrs.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. I got it as a replacement for my aging 9500. It&#x27;s well-made, feels solidly-built, and I expect to use it for several years to come.</li>
    <li> This has a slightly different flex head the the Norelcos, and has far too much play.  You have to move the shaver significantly against your skin before the head moves.  If I hold my finger against the head while shaving, it&#x27;s awkward but ok, but forget about precision shaving.  Also annoying is that the head won&#x27;t hold the cuttings--set it down on the counter, and it spills whiskers.  The only plus is the minutes-remaining charge indicator and that the head doesn&#x27;t pop open as easily as the Norelcos.  Looks like I&#x27;ll be going back to Norelco.</li>
    <li> This Remington R8 shaver is a functional product, as it gives a good, close shave.  I like having the head flip up for cleaning with a brush and/or water vs the Norelco ones that has the entire head come off.  I also like the minutes left before recharge feature so you know how much time you have.  However the workmanship is not as good as the Norelco, it shifts and makes noise as you shave whereas the Norelco is solid and moves smoothly as it goes over your face.  I guess the better workmanship should be expected since the Norelco I switched from cost about twice as much money.  If you just want a good shave I&#x27;d go with this one if you want a nicely built one you&#x27;re willing to pay considerably more for I&#x27;d go with the Norelco.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my 15+ year old Remington Rotary shaver (it still shaves fine, but the sideburn trimmer stopped cutting).  After a couple charging cycles, I am happy with the length of charge and the quality of shave. Much better than the Norelco I purchased a while back (you can read my review on that one also).</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shaver as a replacement for a Norelco that wasn&#x27;t all that great. I had used Norelcos for over 25 years, but my last shaver wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge for more than 4 or 5 days and would give no warning when the battery was about to die. The Remington R8150 seems to be very well made and is easy to handle. I am getting very close/good shaves with it and am very pleased. My last Norelco had washable heads. That was one of the only things I liked about it, and so does the R8150. I hope to use it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I do have this one complaint. Considering the cost, why can&#x27;t  Remington and the other manufacturers include a carrying case with their shavers? Good grief!!! That couldn&#x27;t cost them much. That sure beats carrying my shaver in a small brown paper bag.</li>
    <li> not the strongest and closest shave -- but, not used daily so the beard is strong -- comes in handy when needed</li>
    <li> Brand and price matters. This razor pulls hair.  Had to send back and go back to the tried and true norelco.  Highly recommend AT830.  It doesn&#x27;t pull hairs and has a much better build quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Remington razor a while back and after using it for a short time with a pop up head for rinse cleaning, the release that locks the  head consists of a plastic piece and a metal catch. The plastic piece broke off, I like the shave so , I got another one, ( my mistake.) I take good care of all my equipment, it should not have broken so easily. Remington should look into this and correct it and engineer it to be more sturdy. Has anyone else had tis problem?</li>
    <li> I decided to try this Remington to replace a Norelco.  It took about a week to get used to the differences, but this Reminton is a much better shave.  I bought a second one for a blind friend because it has a charging stand and easier for him to get it connected for charging.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a worn out older shaver for my husband,  he loves it which is good enough for me</li>
    <li> This review is written by my partner, Matthew, who uses the razor: &amp;#34;When I first received this razor, I found the floppiness of the head disconcerting, and was disappointed by the results on my neck. It did, however, perform effectively on flat surfaces such as my face and chin. By supporting the base of the head with a finger and thus eliminating the extra head motion, I am now able to get acceptable results on my neck as well. It performs similarly to my Norelco (which I replaced because of its failure to maintain a charge). This razor seems easier to charge and has had no noticeable battery degradation over the month I have owned it. Given the difference in price between the Remington and the more expensive Norelco models, the Remington is an acceptable compromise.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It pulled on the hairs when shaving and the battery, start, was intermittent. Same problem as the first one. Furthermore, Amazon had the nerve to charge shipping and restocking fees for returning even though I was within the thirty day return period and no mention of the fees to be charged. They just did it. Furthermore, they make it very difficult to contact them. So far I have not found anyway to complain to them directly. Very disappointed and unhappy with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Amazon did finally refund the shipping and restocking fee after I made my complaint to them. It was difficult to find a way to contact them but I did and resolved this issue.</li>
    <li> Ok...kind of pulls hair.  Works well though.</li>
    <li> I like the razor, but emptying the shavings is way too tedious.  All of the little parts inside the head slide into place, so they fall out every time I clean it out, and then have to be put back together.  I&#x27;d still recommend the razor, just be aware that it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll have to deal with.</li>
    <li> WELL , GOT THIS FOR MY BROTHER FOR CHRISTMAS , HE THOROUGHLY ENJOYS IT ,AS HE&#x27;S CLEAN SHAVEN DAILY !&lt;br /&gt;SO I GUESS THIS WAS THE BEST GIFT HE WAS REALLY HOPING FOR THIS YEAR !</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver for the price. I have been using a Norelco for over 30 years. I changed the Norelco battery in the unit already once. A new battery and shaver heads would have cost me more than replacing the old shaver with this Remington. The shave of this new unit is just as good or better than the Norelco. Handling of the shaver is easy and the unit is well designed for your hand... the price cannot be beat, too. I would not buy a Norelco again, for the price of a comprobile unit is twice what I paid for this Remington.</li>
    <li> Nice and close shave.  Though some times I have to go over some parts of my face twice.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver 06/02/2012. Remington says it has a 2-year warranty; however, they refuse to honor it because I do not have the original cashier&#x27;s receipt. They refuse to accept any documentation from Amazon. Just recently, the pop-up trimmer popped off. I have been in contact with Remington with no success. DO NOT BUT THIS SHAVER IF YOU EXPECT CUSTOMER SUPPORT. I, personally will never purchase another Remington product.</li>
    <li> This shaver does the job I bought it to do. I have owned a similar model for years and the battery was slowly dying, so I replaced it with the new one. Feels just like the old one in almost every way. A little fancier, maybe a little lighter in the hand, but still a good shave without the burn I&#x27;ve experienced with other shavers before discovering Remington.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s two year-old razor is better than this. He&#x27;s had it a month now and it still doesn&#x27;t give him a clean shave.  It shaves okay everywhere except his upper lip and chin, so now he looks like he&#x27;s growing out a goatee.</li>
    <li> Great razor it has the power you need  for a great shave, Can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> Hard to get used to in the beginning, but now that I&#x27;ve used it for a while, it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
    <li> Always leave me feeling smooth, and it rarely snags.</li>
    <li> I have a medium beard and this razor does not give a close shave.  Charge lasts for about ten shaves. The razor seems to be well constructed but the shaving head does not flex easy enough for a close shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a gift on April 22, 2015. It was used probably less than a dozen times then it quit working completely. I see that the dead line for returns ended last month. Shame on you Remington for making a poor product. Now I have wasted $96.16 and no working shaver for my husband.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit to replace a 15+ year old shaver.  Produces a close shave and holds a charge for about a month.</li>
    <li> My Remington works great. I have sensitive skin, so it took a couple of shaves for my face to adjust. It leaves a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Shaver head is not very tight...it is too flexible. Noise is a too great. Overall, if I knew this razor would be so poor, I would not have purchased same.</li>
    <li> It provides a razor close shave removing all hair unlike the shave pro cordless. If you want all hair off of your face this product is for you. It&#x27;s also quiet so you can shave without a loud buzz. I highly recommend all Remington rotary titanium blade products.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these as gifts, both receiver&#x27;s seem to like this very much, holds the charge, not too hand heavy</li>
    <li> Good razor, but shaves not really any better than the old one it replaced.  Battery is much improved.  I dropped it and broke the head, but it still functions fine with the little break in it!</li>
    <li> Took a few shaves for my face to get used to it, like in the directions. But works like a charm. Great item.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected.Shaves OK.Your skin gets very dry after shaved.The only advantage is that you can shave corded or cordless.&lt;br /&gt;My opinion overal : keep your options open and look for somewhere else.</li>
    <li> This shaver ( like all I have used ) does not shave like a blade, but it performs as close as possible. I am very happy with the purchase.  It is very smooth and does not irritate my skin like my previous Braun model.</li>
    <li> I have been used to using Norelco, which seems to be a much sturdier line. It works OK, I feel it takes a little longer for me to shave to get the results I want  than before. Had my Norelco for 14 yrs. Easy to use, and  the real time charge indicator is a real plus. Has the ability to be cleaned under faucet, but I have not tried that yet. Overall, satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor just over a year ago.  I generally use an electric razor 3 or 4 times a week, and a regular razor when I want a really close shave.  For an electric razor it gave a pretty good shave, and I found it very easy to clean.  I really liked that it could be cleaned under a faucet.  A full charge lasted me 2 or 3 weeks, and recharging time was very fast.  However, after just one year the razor has died.  It won&#x27;t turn on although the display shows the battery is fully charged.  It has a 2 year warranty and I&#x27;ve emailed Remington about a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review when (or if not) I get a reply and replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 8/22/2014 - I contacted Remington and they had me send the original shaver to them.  Nine days later I received a replacement via UPS, along with a nice note apologizing for the inconvenience.  I expected the replacement to take longer, I was surprised I got it so soon.  Hopefully this new one lasts longer, because otherwise I do really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 6/18/2015 - Almost a year later and the razor is still going strong.</li>
    <li> Great gift for any man who needs a good shave!</li>
    <li> A handsome looking machine to let loose on one&#x27;s flesh I thought at first use and still think so some dozens of shaves later.  Fits in the hand well and the three cutting heads offer an impressively large shaving area and don&#x27;t forget the rather clever pivoting head to meander round every facial crevice.  The countdown timer is a neat addition, too.  I was a bit skeptical about this because I expected, as it got down to just a few minutes remaining, the motor would get noticeably slower, as it did with my previous Remington (the MS2291) but at zero minutes it seemed to be going strong.  However as this is a rechargeable unit the internal battery will wear out even allowing for the twice yearly complete discharge.  My prediction is that the battery will last about four years with normal daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first shaver that I&#x27;ve used that has a hinged cutting head. Normally I would remove the whole thing for cleaning but as this shaver can be cleaned under a tap the head flips open to a right angle.  The head can be removed though by gently pulling it out of its housing.  Incidentally the replacement cost for the three cutters and plastic fixing part is about $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The R8150 gives an excellent shave but not necessarily a quick one.  My Remington MS2291 beats it hands down for a fast smooth finish.  I can&#x27;t see how rotary heads can cut quicker than foil ones.  I&#x27;m assuming that as Norelco has been using rotary technology for years Remington decided to offer both types: foil and rotary and cut into Norelco&#x27;s market share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with a stand/charger and it would have been helpful if this had been designed to allow it to be screwed to a wall near the bathroom shaver point outlet.  Of course, it&#x27;s no problem to just plug the charger into any power point.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over ten years, cheaper than norelco and a nice feature of just plugging it in and continuing shaving if the battery goes dead.</li>
    <li> I have used rotary head shavers all my life. My old faithful finally broke. Sadly, I do not remember what it was. I thought it was a Remington. I bought this shaver. After I shave I still have a five o&#x27;clock stubble. No matter what I do I can not get this shaver to shave the hair off my face. This is the biggest piece of crap I have ever owned. I have owned this for about two months now and I am just going to give it to Goodwill or something.</li>
    <li> have no problem with it so far, bouaght it for for someone and they said they love it..</li>
    <li> great product &amp; price</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver over six months ago.  At first, I hated it and nearly returned it until I discovered exactly how to use it.  With my old one I had to push it against my skin to get a decent shave.  Not with the Remington.  In fact, you will get the very best, closest shave by placing absolutely no pressure - make the heads &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; just above the skin.  The reason I nearly returned it was that it was pulling as I would shave, which hurt.  I tried slowing down, which helped some but once I realized how to just let it cut easy without pressure I got the closest shave ever.</li>
    <li> This is a classic lemon. Not once, not twice, but three times I ordered this piece of - use your imagination - and each time it failed. The first time I put a charge on it but could never get it to turn on. Sent it back and put a charge on the second one and at first the on/off button wouldn&#x27;t always work all the time, but if you messed with it, the thing would come on and go off. However, when I had to put a second charge on it, the charge said fully charged with 60 minutes but there was nothing - completely dead no matter what I tried. Finally, sent that back and the third was a charm - NOT! It took a charge and I used it for a couple weeks, but one day when I went to turn it off, it wouldn&#x27;t turn off! Tried to give it a charge but it never took. Yeah, you got it, three razors in a three month time all failed. THIS IS A LEMON!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, although I was charged a small restocking fee in the end, Amazon was willing each time to offer a straight return with almost no hassle.</li>
    <li> only lasted 10 months</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with it, but have to see how long the baterry lasts</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. Light , quick and easy. Love the charging station. He said he got a close shave and is very happy with it</li>
    <li> My husband has used Remington shavers for years and has never had any issues with their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is easy to use especially with the pivot/flexible head and cleaning is a breeze.  Trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges very well.</li>
    <li> MUY BUENA MAQUINA, ME PUEDO AFEITAR MAS DE 6 VECES ANTES DE VOLVER A CARGAR LA BAT, MUY BUENOS VENDEDORES</li>
    <li> Good shave for a good price.  You can pay a lot more but I chose not to - am pleased with the purchase.  It holds the charge well, seems indeed to last the full 60 minutes and shaves well.  It&#x27;s not as close or smooth as a blade but it is fast, powerful and leaves only a micro sandpaper finish with no stray long whiskers which my old Norelco rotary would leave on my neck.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it too long.  The true test is if it still runs 10 years later.  However, it is working very well. It gives a very close shave.  It is easy to clean.  It has Lithium batteries, so hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this one.  No complaints.  Has recommended this to friends.</li>
    <li> It is good to have a rotary shaver back again.  Tried the foil kind and the biggest problem is you cannot sharpen the blades.  This has the extended battery life 60 minutes and is so easy to clean and it works great</li>
    <li> As recommended by an independent product tester, this shaver lives up to their claims.  It&#x27;s quiet, comfortable to use, easy to clean and one charge lasts over a week.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The Flex 360 is an excellent shaver.  I ordered  the version with the titanium coated cutters for better cutting performance and am glad I did because it cuts cleanly and quickly. It is well designed - I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it, gives me shaving rash.</li>
    <li> So far after a month it seems to be quite good and really holds a charge for a long time and shaves real good -----really cant see why some guys complain about it as for what I paid I think it is real good---Terry</li>
    <li> not realy the blades duled out on first use. if some one could make blades that&lt;br /&gt;wouldent dullout that would make a great razzor.</li>
    <li> Good product and good value.  Arrived to my home fast and no damage to package. Would recommend for a nice electric shave.</li>
    <li> this may not be true with all rotory shavers but if you look on the top of the exposed blade assembly there may be an adjustable thumb screw.  try twisting this and it may adjust the height of the blades closer to the screen.</li>
    <li> This shaver had good reviews but falls short. The head appears similar to norelco but is not. I have tried several shavers and none are as good as morelco</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about four years ago as a replacement for a corded Norelco shaver that I had had for twenty years. I figure that twenty years for an appliance is pretty good; so that was OK. Shortly before the Norelco wore out, I grew a beard to go along with the mustache I&#x27;ve always worn. So the only job the new shaver had was to trim my  beard and mustache on occasion. My beard isn&#x27;t all that heavy, so I considered this to be pretty light duty for a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first couple of years, the shaver did everything it was supposed to. However, a little less than a  year ago, the trimmer stopped working properly. It still functions after a fashion but it doesn&#x27;t work at all well. Shortly after that, the head pulled off its hinges. I&#x27;ve since figured out how to put the head back on its hinges, but I&#x27;ve concluded that this shaver is not constructed for the long haul. For my purposes, a $4 pair of mustache scissors from Walmart seems to be a much better solution.</li>
    <li> Bought as the first razor for my 14 year old son. Broke after 5 shaves. I&#x27;ve had my Norelco for 22 years. Will buy him a better razor  from a reputable company.</li>
    <li> Product works pretty good so far. Good comfort and long battery life. However when the battery gets to about 50% it loses some of the cutting oompf. Good for price. Have had for 1-2 months</li>
    <li> This razor does an outstanding job of giving a close shave. Easy to clean with running water. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Had it a long time now and it works good, battery is holding up well and hasn&#x27;t lost any capacity, hasn&#x27;t needed blades or anything.</li>
    <li> Thank you, just as described!</li>
    <li> charges quickly, digital time remaining readout seems accurate (up to 60 mins). reasonably close shave. doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.&lt;br /&gt;very lightweight.</li>
    <li> I decided to try another brand of shavers after having used Norelco rotaries for 44 years. BIG MISTAKE. (Stupid Decision of which I cannot figure why I made it.) It looks cheap and feels cheap. My face looks like sausage in sphagetti sauce. Never had this trouble before. I should have stayed with what worked before. This is going back.</li>
    <li> Using the Remington R8150BCDN is tantamount to taking a trip down memory lane - back to the bad old days of shaving. Back in the 1960s shavers got hot after a few minutes, were often heavy, made a lot of noise, and gave a disappointing shave. Those attributes perfectly describe the Remington R8150! Comparing this Remington to a Norelco Arcitec 3-D is like comparing an old Ford Falcon to a new BMW: both do the job they were built for, but what a difference. I usually try to make the best of my less-than-stellar purchases, but I think I will make an exception for this shaver - I will take it to a thrift store today.</li>
    <li> well the deadline for being able to return or refund this item was may 19th....now it has stopped working, and i feel like it was a huge wast of money.</li>
    <li> Gave it a full charge, used it now daily for over 2 weeks and it still shows 52 minutes remaining. Cuts close and quick. Overall a very nice shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a relative as a gift because I was so pleased with my own. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> Nowhere near as good as my ancient Philips/Norelco. Heads seem like they arrive dull. Makes a lot of noise but face feels like I shaved with a flame thrower when finished. Takes 3 times as long to saw beard off.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my father, I really don&#x27;t know too much about  shavers , but when my dad told me it was so amazing he didn&#x27;t use the conventional shaver to complete his shaved I knew I did ok.</li>
    <li> This shaver works fine, but does not provide as close a shave of some of the earlier Remington shaver models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little harder to clean,, having to disassemble the small parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington has made changes in the design and not improvements to performance and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with purchase, but my father is experiencing some difficulties in getting a close shave and also in disassembling the shaver head in order to clean it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic item, good value and great service. I highly recommend this product to anyone needing or wanting, has worked flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I bough the shaver do to the fact it was theoretically new.&lt;br /&gt;The initial charge last only foy ona shave.  After that it doesn&#x27;t work at all. It is completely damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Frankly speaking I waste my money.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to receive my refund immediately. !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DR. GUILLERMO MARTINEZ</li>
    <li> This work as good as I could have hoped. Of course it is a Remington. LOL Great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> It was ok, on full charge, it lasts an hour. the  units of charge is in minutes left with power. the trimmer is very handy but shaving on a whole using this shaver is lengthy. would recommend for short hair. would be easier to get a hair cutting trimmer/clipper kit</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it did not come with a brush for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday.  He reports it as &amp;#34;works well.  A little noisy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Price was competitive with other similar products..I would recommend this product. I have a Norelco shaver and it works just as well</li>
