      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to describe it accurately</li>

      <li>but i since i am going natural w/</li>
      <li>Although I got the initial results I was going for, I shortly discovered she used the wrong product in my hair as it began to shed more and more week after week.  </li>
      <li>I put it in my natural hair while wet, it is absorbed into the hair shafts, and seals the ends.</li>
      <li>Now that I have returned back to my natural hair (3 yrs now)</li>
      <li>real bonus with LIV is this: if I DON&#x27;T workout in the evening, I can actually go a night without doing anything to my hair, other than putting on my satin sleep cap.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife claims that this is a super product, at a fabulous price...</li>
    <li> Keeps my daughter&#x27;s hair together!</li>
    <li> This has changed the health and look of my sons hair. We use it every day! I would recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> Product arrived timely and was exactly as I expected.  I have purchased the item locally so I knew what to expect and it was exactly as it was supposed to be.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Liv Creme Hairdressing and Conditioner is My go to hair dressing for natural hair. I put it in my natural hair while wet, it is absorbed into the hair shafts, and seals the ends. Lock in the curl pattern with Eco gel and I&#x27;m set. I&#x27;ve spent a lot more but haven&#x27;t found anything that works better on my kinky curls.</li>
    <li> After looking for the right product for my daughter&#x27;s hair, someone suggested I&#x27;d try Liv. It&#x27;s all they say and more.</li>
    <li> The product was sent super fast and i am a very happy customer.  I do recommend them to any one.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it moisturizes my hair. I do have natural hair and this product works perfect for it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom to put on her hair in between a shampoo and deep condition day. She loves it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> ive been using this stuff on my hair for the longest time ever but i since i am going natural w/ my hair i returned back to it! this stuff is so moisturizing and gives a great shine to my hair. it makes my hair sooo soft and easy to manage in its natural state. this is definetly one of my staples that i will always use for years to come!</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product.  This is also sold in Sally&#x27;s but I didn&#x27;t have time to drive and get it so I ordered it online.  I love this product for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Keeps her scalp moisturized and smells so good! Her hair keeps it&#x27;s tiny curls and shines. Very happy with it.  It will last a while....</li>
    <li> This product lives up to the expectations of the claims on the packaging.  The persons that I purchased it for love it!</li>
    <li> The smell was just too horrible and mediciney to get past for me. One of my FAVORITE youtubers, Naptutal85, swears by it so I ordered it. But as soon as I opened the cap, the smell hit me over the head. I won&#x27;t be using this at all, but the seller was awesome!</li>
    <li> When I decided to forgo the relaxer for the second time, I read time and time again that any product that contains mineral oil, paraffin, petroleum, lanolin, beeswax and slew of ingredients was bad for the hair.  The reason was that it prevented moisture from entering the hair shaft, which can lead to stunted hair growth or something of that nature.  So I bought into it.  Spent crazy amount of money on products in which a majority did nothing major for my hair, save for a handful of products.  At one point I had an epiphany and realized that it technically doesn&#x27;t matter what I put on my hair since hair is dead.  The scalp is a different story but my hair is more or less fair game.  I have porous 4a/4b/4c hair that does not retain moisture for long.  I incorporated the LOC/LCO methods several months back and it slowly improved my hair but now that the weather is becoming cooler I needed something heavier.  Most oils and butters only last in my hair for about two or three days before I need to reapply and with my crazy schedule, I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to fuss with my hair as I would like.  Enter Liv Hairdressing Creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this jar in my stash for some time.  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t throw it away.  This stuff is a godsend for my hair.  But I do not use it on dry hair, because it leaves my hair kind of stiff.  This is what I do.  After I shampoo my hair, I mist it with my blend (mostly made of products I am using up), then a pea size amount of Giovanni Leave in conditioner (I want to hate it but it works for my needs) and then a small amount of this Liv Creme Hairdressing on my hair (never on the scalp) and twist/braid my hair.  I also use a smidgen to seal the ends.  After a day or two, when I take it down, my twist outs/braid outs look amazing.  Minimal frizz and well defined curls.  They last about two days but I made them big since I am pressed for time.  I plan to do mini twist with this stuff.  Oh I should mention that my hair is moist foralmost a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must stress that a little goes a long way.  I am not joking folks.  Since it contains the forbidden ingredients, you might have to resort to a harsher shampoo to remove it (sulfate based).  But I have some Kinky Curly Come Clean shampoo that helps remove the buildup.  Not to mention a slew of shampoos in the product graveyard.  Also I must mention that this stuff has an odor.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it accurately but I detect a scent of lanolin and chemically-scented flowers.  If you have a sensitive nose, just pass it unless you are not phased by the smell of Perm Repair, Sulfur 8, Wild Growth Hair oil, etc.  I will admit that this product is not for everyone but I am just sharing on what works for me.  I did try this over the summer and it was a bit too heavy.  But I might try it again because I want to get back into swimming and I can see this being beneficial for my hair.</li>
    <li> I was so happy that Amazon carries this product. This is the only product that works in my daughter&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s not greasy and it smells so good. It makes her scalp and hair moisturized. I have used this for years and will continue to unless they go out of business. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> So, I started my natural hair journey by accident.  I had been without a relaxer for over 10 years and a press was doing me just fine.  But, I noticed within the past year (my doctor tells me I have entered menopause, which effects hair) I just couldn&#x27;t get my hair to cooperate after a workout anymore.  So, I thought I&#x27;d try for the wash &#x27;n go styles that are becoming so popular.  Too much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some trial and error, my stylist and I decided to go for a texturizer just to help tame the tight, kinky coils.  Although I got the initial results I was going for, I shortly discovered she used the wrong product in my hair as it began to shed more and more week after week.  My hair went from shoulder length to snap-your-fingers short in about a month.  I was undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wearing a wig for 6 months, I decided to do the big chop and see what I was working with...a TWA.  Not my style.  So, I tried to find creams and souffles to coax the curls.  Nothing worked.  But, always in the back of my mind I could recall years ago when I went through another short stage and someone used this product in a red and white jar, but I couldn&#x27;t remember the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, one day while I was looking for a totally different product, my eyes fell upon LIV and I almost screamed.  THIS STUFF WORKS!  As another reviewer noted, I have very tight, kinky coils.  Basically, I have an afro.  But with LIV, I can actually comb through my hair well enough to roll it at night.  Now, I use a LOT, especially on the ends, because when I work out, my head is WET from the sweat.  However, it also gets prettier.  So after a shower--NO shower cap--I can actually go out for the evening which I couldn&#x27;t do before without an hour of blow drying and curling (and causing heat damage as well as wasting time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real bonus with LIV is this: if I DON&#x27;T workout in the evening, I can actually go a night without doing anything to my hair, other than putting on my satin sleep cap.  The next morning, all I have to do is lightly pick out my hair from the root to lift the curls--not combing through--and it&#x27;s just as pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER again go without Liv.  It&#x27;s just what MY hair needs and I am SO glad to have found it again.ave to do is lightly pick out my hair from the root to lift the curls--not combing through--and it&#x27;s just as pretty.    I will NEVER again go without Liv.  It&#x27;s just what MY hair needs and I am SO glad to have found it again.</li>
    <li> i grew up on the product when I was child. Now that I have returned back to my natural hair (3 yrs now) I wanted to go back to what my mom use to use on me. This product is amazing, I will always have this in my house. It makes my hair very soft and I can use it everyday. My mom loves it and I also use it on my sons hair too. Great product!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and adds shine to my hair. Great Product and timely shipping. Product was in excellent shape still in shrink wrap.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
