      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE YOUR PRODUCTS</li>
      <li>There are so many cleansers on the market.</li>
      <li>Packaging and bottle look authentic but after opening it i&#x27;m not so sure.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t use it more than once a day or so.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>To start, this cleanser is wonderful because it actually makes my skin look smoother and more clarified.</li>
      <li>I have gotten many compliments since I&#x27;ve started using this.</li>
      <li>It gets out my make up, but you have to be cleaning your face for more than just 2 seconds.  </li>
      <li>I bought it for my teenager on a recommendation from the awesome aesthetician in a local doc&#x27;s office.  </li>
      <li>and I love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I prefer a product that lathers more.</li>
      <li>and I just love using it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t repeat the product unless I really love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this product it keeps my skin very clean</li>
      <li>But it is very effective and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s just not the same as my Rhonda Allison Skin Brightening Cleanser that I&#x27;ve loved forever!</li>
      <li>Product is fantastic at cleaning your skin but not drying it out.  </li>
      <li>I will also use my clairsonic when I feel that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel smooth.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this one because my skin does well with it</li>
      <li>; I do not think it has the skin cell turnover properties of the original.</li>
      <li>So excited to receive this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money, and I&#x27;m not one to spend this much on a cleanser, but when it does this good of a job, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Takes off make-up, leaves skin feeling clean yet not stripped, works well with my clarisonic.</li>
      <li>cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, awesome product, highly recomonded</li>
      <li>You only need one pump to get a good lather and clean your face.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent and the gentle foaming it produces.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, I ran across a review that said that the Biomedic line was bought by Skinceuticals.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle and scent free which I like.</li>
      <li>It is a great, gentle but effective cleanser that (with regular use) will keep your skin younger and clearer looking.  </li>
      <li>My 44 year old skin has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>I stayed at a friend&#x27;s house recently and she had a cleanser by Skinceuticals that I really liked.  </li>
      <li>Not as powerful as the clarifiying cleanser</li>
      <li>most cleansers either irritate my skin or don&#x27;t clean well enough.</li>
      <li>My chin used to break out right before my period, but not anymore.  </li>
      <li>It takes me two uses to really feel like my skin is clean.</li>
      <li>Love all Skin Ceuticals cleansers, this reduces any pours you might have and leaves skin soft and ready for your nighttime care or your makeup.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin clear and I love that it gently exfoliates without being a scrub, etc</li>
      <li>THANK YOU VERY MUCH</li>
      <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried this product - may reorder, too soon to tell.</li>
      <li>I always getting complements how clear and smooth my face looks.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is the first part of a skin care regime suggested by a cosmetic surgeon.</li>
      <li>It seems to be pretty balanced.</li>
      <li>I use several Skin Ceuticals products and love them all.  </li>
      <li>I have only used the new cleasening gel for a week,but so far so good.</li>
      <li>My skin feels clean but not dried out.  </li>
      <li>Used this cleanser for years - great way to not overly dry skin while actually getting a decent cleanse out of it.</li>
      <li>It really cleans your face well without drying it out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY SHE GETS FIVE STAR REVIEW.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LOVE YOUR PRODUCTS AND YOU STAND BEHIND YOUR PRODUCTS.    HAVE A GOOD DAY,  PAULA</li>
    <li> One of the best facial cleansers you can find. Definitely try it. It helps purify and clear up your complexion, and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been buying this under various brands (I follow the formula!) for probably twenty years. It&#x27;s perfect. I have rosacea and a couple of patches of eczema, and this has never bothered my skin. Cleans like a champ and no irritation.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite cleansers. I began using this because the spa I get facials at uses this line. It is very gentle and scent free which I like. I think it is very good at removing eye makeup on the first try. I love mascara so I have to cleanse my eyelashes multiple times with other cleansers. I feel like this cleanser comes through with the promise of evening skin tone. I am not a big cleanser gal (usually I use Dove bar soap) but this is one that I will splurge for.</li>
    <li> Great, have order this many time.</li>
    <li> Excellent skin care product when combined with the Skinceuticals Purifying Conditioner.  Have been using for a number of years and I always get compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any changes or improvements</li>
    <li> Has glycolic which really helps to rejuvenate my mature skin. My skin looks 15 years younger. (their words not mine)</li>
    <li> Best cleanser I ever used.</li>
    <li> I have used for years. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Product is fantastic at cleaning your skin but not drying it out.  Very good value and great replacement to hand soap.</li>
    <li> And I&#x27;ve been through a ridiculous number of skin care products in the hopes of finding something that will exfoliate effectively without leaving clogged pores behind or irritating my ridiculously sensitive skin.  A little goes a long way when paired with a Clarisonic brush, and if you have super-sensitive skin like mine, you&#x27;ll probably want to use it once a day. I use Philosophy Purity Made Simple in the AM to give my skin a break from actives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it may seem like these two high-end cleansers have a high-end price, you have to keep in mind that you get a generous amount of concentrated product. I highly recommend the both of them for uber-sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for two years now and my skin looks good. It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser for every day twice a day and never dries skin. My skin tone has balanced also.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried this product - may reorder, too soon to tell. I&#x27;ve used .Skinceuticals and trust the product line</li>
    <li> I was happy with my skin products, but when I ran out of cleanser (was using obagi) on vacation I purchased this and have been extremely happy. My skin feels great and the texture of my skin has improved. I am 35 with normal to dry skin. I am going to try more products by this company!</li>
    <li> I love the skinceuticals line since It was recommended to me by a physician.  I have been using it for about a year now and it is one of the best cleansers I have tried.  I follow it with the skinceuticals conditioning solution for exfoliating. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time.  I really like the skinceuticals products.  They are a bit pricey, but do last a long time.  Usually this bottle lasts 6-8 months.  You only need one pump to get a good lather and clean your face.  It gets out my make up, but you have to be cleaning your face for more than just 2 seconds.  If you use any primers, you will need to use baby oil to take your make up off b/c this cleanser will not get all of it off.  I use this everyday twice a day and it is not harsh to my skin.  I have combo skin, oily in the t zone.  I will also use my clairsonic when I feel that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used twice a day.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome highly recommended. I use it in the morning and at night followed with skin ceuticals night correction products. It leaves my face looking flawless and smooth. I always getting complements how clear and smooth my face looks.</li>
    <li> A great price for the quantity received. However, it&#x27;s just not the same as my Rhonda Allison Skin Brightening Cleanser that I&#x27;ve loved forever! Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as deep and doesn&#x27;t lather. I&#x27;ll use it up and switch back to my fav!</li>
    <li> Used this cleanser for years - great way to not overly dry skin while actually getting a decent cleanse out of it.</li>
    <li> Box in package was smashed and the lid to the gel was slightly open  it had leaked into the box. This was a new product I was trying. Love Skinceuticals products but this gel felt slimy.  Wouldn&#x27;t order this product again.</li>
    <li> love skinceuticals products!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is the first part of a skin care regime suggested by a cosmetic surgeon. I get compliments all the time and people don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them my age! I&#x27;ve never had cosmetic procedures done and it looks like I won&#x27;t need any if I keep this as part of my routine.</li>
    <li> There are so many cleansers on the market. I enjoy this one because my skin does well with it and it&#x27;s not too expensive. Does the job!!</li>
    <li> 5 Stars ... the wife loves this stuff ... cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, awesome product, highly recomonded</li>
    <li> To start, this cleanser is wonderful because it actually makes my skin look smoother and more clarified. I have gotten many compliments since I&#x27;ve started using this. It keeps my skin clear and I love that it gently exfoliates without being a scrub, etc....&lt;br /&gt;I do wear a long wear foundation everyday and my routine is as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I use Almay makeup remover towelettes to efficiently remove my foundation, they&#x27;re about $5 a pack.&lt;br /&gt;2. I cleanse with my skinceuticals purifying cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;3. Twice a week I use Arcona&#x27;s tea tree mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all and I love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, my skin is normal/ combination and none of these products dry my skin and I never get that tight feeling after cleansing. It seems to be pretty balanced. Although, throughout the day I do get oily in my T- zone and I have blotting sheets for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped</li>
    <li> service was very good</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I used to use it years ago when it was owned by Roche Posay. Luckily, I ran across a review that said that the Biomedic line was bought by Skinceuticals. This face wash cleans my face really well without drying it out. I use it once a day for one minute. I have significantly less breakouts when I use this.</li>
    <li> I stayed at a friend&#x27;s house recently and she had a cleanser by Skinceuticals that I really liked.  I&#x27;m not sure this is the same one but it&#x27;s been wonderful.  My skin feels clean but not dried out.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great for renewal of tired &amp; rough skin. My skin is dull &amp; rough if I dont use it daily</li>
    <li> This cleanser works for me.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product it keeps my skin very clean and I keep one in my shower and one by the sink so I always have it close by when I need it!</li>
    <li> I actually ordered the wrong product but was willing to give it a try since I like other skinceutical products.  It does a satisfactory job of cleaning and does not dry out my skin but I prefer a product that lathers more.</li>
    <li> Item came fast and sealed. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Amazing product that does the job with no effort. Feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Use it everyday and have for few years now.  Will definitely be reordering in the future</li>
    <li> Effective cleanser, but it does not clean the same as the old Biomedic Cleanser; I do not think it has the skin cell turnover properties of the original.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Great Customer Service!</li>
    <li> The Cleansing Gel is a great cleanser. I am a Male  in my 20&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t know how great it works for makeup, but I love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell in the world, but I would prefer it to give me great looking skin instead of 2 minutes of a great scent which it delivers. It is a thick gel which causes a little to go a long way. Use the Toner afterwards which will make your skin looking amazing!</li>
    <li> I have combination problematoc skin. I jave been using this face wash along with the toner and moisturizer and have notice a dramtic difference in my skins texture and clarity. Yes I still break out with adult acne, but it has improved greatly in the past few months. Also, I have not broken out with cystic acne in a few months which is a major plus in my book.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as the clarifiying cleanser I can&#x27;t find anymore, but good quality.</li>
    <li> not impressed with this cleanser at all!&lt;br /&gt;hated the consistency&lt;br /&gt;Does not foam up at all</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Excellent skin care product.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  A must have.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my teenager on a recommendation from the awesome aesthetician in a local doc&#x27;s office.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Better than more expensive products. I usually use the M.D. Forte products, but have switched to SkinCeuticals instead. The bottle has a pump, which makes it much easier to use. I have only used the new cleasening gel for a week,but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Packaging and bottle look authentic but after opening it i&#x27;m not so sure.&lt;br /&gt;It smells rancid/old and plastic, I used it twice and it definitely does not feel like&lt;br /&gt;the cleanser I&#x27;ve used before, I will not be putting this on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying different skin products....I don&#x27;t repeat the product unless I really love it.  This cleaner does it all for me.  Takes off make-up, leaves skin feeling clean yet not stripped, works well with my clarisonic. a little goes a long way, slight pleasant scent with the slightest tingle, good dispenser---use as much or little as you want,  I am 62, in the past oily skin but normal now.  I still have to be careful with products that can clog my pores and cause blackheads. This one is a winner for me.</li>
    <li> I like the cleanser but it was not exactly what I was hoping for.  It takes me two uses to really feel like my skin is clean. It&#x27;s consistency is too liquid and it does not suds or foam up the way you would hope a cleanser would do.  It does the job but I just like it, not love it.</li>
    <li> So excited to receive this product. Skinceutical makes very good Products but this Particular Facewash was very Refreshing to use and that&#x27;s about it. Be skeptical because everyone&#x27;s skin type is somewhat different. I just don&#x27;t feel it did much for my skin it&#x27;s almost sort of a waxy feeling for me after using. But I still swear by Skinceuticals just not this Facewash for my Skintype</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for years...initially started purchasing it in the office where I had a Parisian Peel.  It is a great, gentle but effective cleanser that (with regular use) will keep your skin younger and clearer looking.  Many of the products in this line have been replaced in my cosmetologists&#x27; office with the Obaji line and I am happy this one is still available.</li>
    <li> Love Skinceuticals products. This cleansing gel works very well.  Love the consistency and the scent.  It can be a bit drying so I don&#x27;t use it more than once a day or so.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for skin!</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I have been using it for years and it is great for my skin.  I used to purchase it from my doctor&#x27;s office but it is easier to get it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love all Skin Ceuticals cleansers, this reduces any pours you might have and leaves skin soft and ready for your nighttime care or your makeup.</li>
    <li> I have always love this product but it is getting expensive.  I now buy another product at the store which is half the price and has almost the same effect and works for me.</li>
    <li> I started using this brand on the recommendation of my dermatologist and it has done wonders for my skin. From the cleansing standpoint, it clears all the make-up off my face using just one pump. In turn, using only one pump means the bottle lasts me between 3 and 4 months which helped me get over the sticker shock. My skin feels better, less blemishes (generally blackheads or small whiteheads for me) and I just love using it.</li>
    <li> Great producte! most cleansers either irritate my skin or don&#x27;t clean well enough. this is gentle and cleans extremely well.</li>
    <li> Works good taking off makeup for the most part, would like it better if it were more of a foaming cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love it! This is the only cleanser I use on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really cleans your face well without drying it out.  I love the scent and the gentle foaming it produces.  I have been using this product for about 6 years and I consider myself a face product junkie/expert!  Stick with this product a.m. and p.m. daily.  I get professional facials every 5 weeks and used to buy direct from my doctors office but the price was sky high.  This is a great competitive price.</li>
    <li> My 44 year old skin has never looked better.  This cleanser controls my oily skin and keeps pre-menstrual break-outs to the barest of minimums.  My chin used to break out right before my period, but not anymore.  I won&#x27;t use any other cleanser but this.  It&#x27;s well worth the money, and I&#x27;m not one to spend this much on a cleanser, but when it does this good of a job, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> i bought this product for my daughter and she likes it. medical grade stuf always helps..the glycolic in this product is not harsh either even for my daughters young skin...</li>
    <li> I use several Skin Ceuticals products and love them all.  I can now say the same about this facial cleanser...if you are looking for a foaming cleanser, this is not it.  But it is very effective and I highly recommend it.</li>
