      <li>I bought them because they are hello kitty, but i&#x27;m super impressed with how soft they are.</li>
      <li>the price i am sure these would work just fine for someone that just wanted some cute brushes.</li>
      <li>My oldest daughter was jealous that I got them a good quality set better than hers and wants me to buy it for her too.</li>

      <li>SUCH A GOOD PRICE :)</li>
      <li>It was an absolute hit!!!</li>
      <li>These would work perfect for a teenage girl that was first starting out and loved Hello Kitty.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I gave this to my friend for her bday and she loves them! Her makeup looks flawless and there&#x27;s more brushes in this travel size than the usual other travel size makeup brushes</li>
    <li> I can not believe the price I payed for these they were so cheap and they are the best quality brushes I have ! as a make up artist I highly recommend these</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes and didn&#x27;t realize they were the &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; version of the real thing. Anyway that wasn&#x27;t the main problem-these things fell apart completely. The part where the brush is attached to the wooden handle separated. Which just means it&#x27;s made out of cheap material and was glued together.</li>
    <li> I thought I could not wait so the brushes and saw how I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;They are super soft wonderful, perfect size for walk with them in my bag without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> They are not real MAC brushes, but they work just like them! They are beautiful especially with the Hello Kitty!</li>
    <li> This product states that it is salon quality.  All of the brushes are a synthetic fiber.  This is the worst knock off, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the package made me sneeze and gave me a headache.  This was the worst thing I have ever bought from Amazon.  Terrible, terrible quality.</li>
    <li> Not a good buy cheap brushes have the one from Mac this is a fake ordered some other brushes they were better stay away</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! The brushes are so soft and I would purchase this item again any time!! I only paid $3.57 for mine and plus shipping which was $7.50 all together but it was MORE than worth it! This is so much better than going to a department store and spending $30-$40 on 1 brush which is ridiculous!! If you are thinking about buy this product, DO IT!! You will LOVE them! You won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> I was upset that the main brush was to small I thought it be a lot fluffier but no. Another thing is that they broke easily I used to of them and right off the bat they fell off the still so it was pointless :( should be better quality.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! BEAUTIFUL BRUSHES! QUALITY MATERIAL! MY FRIENDS WANT THIS ONE TOO! I GREAT PRODUCT! GREAT PRICE TOO! I&#x27;M IN LOVE WITH...</li>
    <li> Needed brushes that were similar to Hello Kitty brush set.  They shed a little, but all brushes do.  Added these to my collection.</li>
    <li> The quality is ok, not good, not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is good for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer using my old brushes but I gave them a month ago, I wanted to replace them with this ones, this was a mistake, this are not as good as my old ones :(.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the bristles, very soft and non abrasive. even application with liquid foundation and creme concealer.</li>
    <li> Great Gift for my 17 year old daughter who is addicted to Make-Up. They were high quality and she is very happy!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin Fields-Robinson</li>
    <li> I bought these for my girlfriend because she loves Mac and Hello Kitty. It turns out this set of Brushes are Fake Mac Brushes. Mac only made a 3 piece brush set not a 7 piece. Don&#x27;t buy unless you want fake ones.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my cousin.  She loved it and I got the best price here, alot of sellers were over pricing this and Hello Kitty&#x27;s face isn&#x27;t even on the brush handles just painted on the front of the carrying case, so for the price I got it for here was worth it, don&#x27;t pay more than 10 bucks for this item.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price but half of the brushes are really bad..Will not recommend to others if you are looking for good eye brushes</li>
    <li> Great little travel brush set. I bought this for my 6 year old twins to have to play with their play makeup. They love hello kitty so thought it would be cute. The only negatives are you can barely see the hello kitty on the front and the brushes are shorter and not a full size brush set which the description does not indicate. Since it was for my kids to play with that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me. But if you want a full size set this isn&#x27;t for you. My oldest daughter was jealous that I got them a good quality set better than hers and wants me to buy it for her too. The quality of the set was much better than I expected and definitely for that price. This set came with almost every brush a real make up artist would use in their daily routine. Great product!</li>
    <li> Wow, i was expecting the brushes to be harder for the price i paid. I bought them because they are hello kitty, but i&#x27;m super impressed with how soft they are. totally a wonderful set of travel brushes and SO CUTE :)</li>
    <li> I got these brushes and i really liked the packaging that it came in. I also really like the brushes it&#x27;s really easy for me to just throw into my back pack considering IM a college student on the go.</li>
    <li> A complete knock off. Hello kitty looks like a toddler drew it (or worse I drew it since I can&#x27;t draw!) and NOT a MAC product. i think that&#x27;s the biggest nose turn up. However, I will give it some redemption. Aside from that, the brushes are not that bad. I just needed a travel set to throw in my bag for traveling. Something I didn&#x27;t really care about if it got lost in transit, broke or stolen. The brushes are fair quality and get the job done enough. I just wanted a cheaper alternative than taking brushes that I&#x27;d be upset if I lost or left somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jill</li>
    <li> for the price these brushes are great!!! and they come with a cute travel case, and they are good quality. i actually ordered one from my friend!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve used it once and am in love!&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush and eye shadow brushes are fantastic!</li>
    <li> I use MAC makeup and need a good set of travel brushes.  These are good brushes for travel--quality is there, just smaller in size.</li>
    <li> I just love these brushes.  They are the perfect traveling size. They don&#x27;t shed any hairs at all! Easy to clean and oh so cute.</li>
    <li> This item is not an actual MAC item it feels cheap and the &amp;#34;MAC&amp;#34; words rub off!! Would not recommend</li>
    <li> It is a good product, could be better for the MAC, but caters for those who want to use a makeup base for day to day.</li>
    <li> To start these brushes are not from M.A.C. So yes they are fake. Doesn&#x27;t really do the job as I expected. A product like this should be sold for $4 at the most.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the brushes NO COMPLAINTS here! This is my 1st set of MAC brushes EVER; I&#x27;ve been wearing MAC for 10+ yrs but I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay the high prices for them.  Oh how I was so wrong!!! I&#x27;m quite ashamed of my self especially since I just spent about $120 on (1 single) 2004 limited edition of the MAC pigment \\&quot;All Girl\\&quot; exclusively sold in Nordstroms like 3 weeks ago.  My husband doesn&#x27;t mined or care how much I spend on my make up and has been on me for years to get the MAC brushes at any expense. Due to the fact that my addiction is MAC and his is guns (hey he&#x27;s a compition shooter and we are both avid hunters, fun to pet better to eat).  I&#x27;m SURE I&#x27;ll get quite a few comments about that last statement, but hey as my mother used to say, \\&quot;To each his own.\\&quot; I have thousands of dollars in MAC and he has hundreds of thousands of dollars on guns. A big thank you to this seller for literally changing my life!!!!</li>
    <li> WAY smaller then the brush&#x27;s look. I dont even use them because they are just plain worthless.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product and I am exceptionally please with it.  The brushes are the exact size and quality that I was looking for.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> VERY CHEAP!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DOUBT THESE ARE REALLY MAC SALON QUALITY MAKEUP BRUSHES !!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED I SPENT MY MONEY ON THIS.</li>
    <li> Missing a brush :/ it shows 7and one was missing when I finally opened it. Also, the brush broke after two uses</li>
    <li> Such a great starter or travel brush set has everything you need except a powder brush but you could use the stippling brush for powder if wanted. All the brushes and incredibly soft. If I didn&#x27;t know any better I would have thought this a real Mac product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE! SUCH A GOOD PRICE :) I AM SO GLAD I ORDERED THEM!! DEFIANTLY WORTH THE PRICE I PAID:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was a rip off but I still use the brushes everyday, so they&#x27;re really not a bad price. They fell apart but that was solved with some glue. Overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied whether they&#x27;re mac or not</li>
    <li> Love them!  They arrived quickly and are working out just fine in the makeup bag I keep in my gym bag!</li>
    <li> They are amazing brushes!  I needed travel brushes and I liked them so much I got them for everyone in my family.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes were up to my expectations and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I recommend these brushes to beginners trying to start a simple kit.</li>
    <li> I made a purchase I have not received anything stolen my money I will not buy anything whit this comapny, bothers me not having a phone where dial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;English&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arabic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a purchase I have not received anything stolen my money I will not buy anything</li>
    <li> I had ordered this brush set on sept. 11th, 2012 and had recieved them on sept. 14th, 2012. Shippment was fast! I absolutely love the brushes and will be using them until they fall apart. They dont shed alot but for the money its worth it! I will surelly use them until they fall apart! Thanks agian!-Rebcea</li>
    <li> the brushes are similar to the picture displayed. The pouch has a bad odour. Brushes are small and nice but one brush is messed up and shapeless. The others are good have to use them very carefully and the hair keeps falling out even when i clean them every now and then and condition them.</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice, but the leather wasnt good quality. The front of the Hello Kitty looked as if someone spilled acetone and tried to erase the sticker.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my nieces for Christmas. They loved it! It was an absolute hit!!! Excellent product excellent price.</li>
    <li> It works good for the most part but some of the brush handles have already seperated off so i had to glue them back on which was annoying.</li>
    <li> it says is mac but is not&lt;br /&gt;two weeks from getting them they started to lose its hair&lt;br /&gt;never buying again</li>
    <li> I was little disappointed in the quality of these brushes. Wish the bristles didnt fall out. I have only used once and the brushes leaves little hairs on my face. So I barley use them. But I love the case its super cute and you can use for other small brushes. So over all I think it was an ok purchase. But if your looking for really sterdy brushes I would look elsewhere. These would work perfect for a teenage girl that was first starting out and loved Hello Kitty. That was the main reason I bought them because I love Hello Kitty and they are super cute. they say MAC brush set. But I really do not think that they are MAC Brushes. So just beware..</li>
    <li> It says its a travel size but I use the set for everyday use and it works great. The brushes are super soft and the quality is great. One of the handles is a little loose but I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
    <li> it was a bit small, but thats why its TRAVEL size! I absolutely loved this gift,i got it for my sister and she LOVES make up!</li>
    <li> Beware this brush set is NOT a genuine MAC product. Asked a consultant at MAC store and discovered that it is a complete rip off. A $15 MAC brush set too good to be true?... it is.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes but one handle was broken on a brush and I had to fix it myself. Works great though!</li>
    <li> i love the brushes! exactly what i wanted! the brushes are high quality and i love the hello kitty on them!</li>
    <li> Some of the top of the brushes had broken off. made cheap i believe. brush to it was not like how i believed it would be.</li>
    <li> This is a good travel set. the contour/blush brush came with the base unglued so it falls off when I try to use it. Other than that, no complaints here.</li>
    <li> I received this Mac Hello Kitty travelers make-up brushes quickly and packaged very well. I&#x27;m giving it as a Christmas gift and haven&#x27;t looked at the brushes but will come back and update. The case looks nice though.</li>
    <li> Brushes broke off handles. Unhappy with product. Became dirty quickly because of black casing color. Would not recommend. Better brushes at Walmart.</li>
    <li> This is awful they are so fake they feel aprt the first day I got them ! And they smell so bad don&#x27;t buy these its not worth is I like the e.l.f cosmetics brushes better not worth it</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice to have, but honestly if you already have other make up brushes, you do not need these. They brushes are pretty stiff, and honestly the ecoTools &amp; real techniques brushes I do have are a lot softer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used them once, and do not find myself even reaching for them.</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived promptly.&lt;br /&gt;One of the brushes came broken. It was unglued.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are just okay definitely not as good as my other Mac brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The case is very cheap and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Not Mac quality at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would return this if I could.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teen daughter. I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with the quality of the case, but she loved the Hello Kitty. The brushes were perfect for a girl her age.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for Hello Kitty brushes so I bought this. I figured if it was on Amazon it must be real MAC. When I received them first the case had an odor as did the brushes. Upon inspection the straight edge brush was cut incorrectly. small amounts of glue showing where they were attached to handles. I did some research on Knock Offs on line. According to experts as well as MAC. They never released any Hello Kitty brushes in a set like this. The only true set is the Hello Kitty head with brushes in it.&lt;br /&gt;For the price i am sure these would work just fine for someone that just wanted some cute brushes. They seemed to be fairly decent brushes i have seen much worse. A girl experimenting with make up would like them just fine.&lt;br /&gt;But if you are looking for high quality MAC brushes these are not them. I sent them back because my picky daughter is only into MAC.&lt;br /&gt;So to help those looking at these I can&#x27;t give them a good rating because they are not MAC and that is how they are advertised. But the bristles were straight and full and seem to be decent quality but i never used them. Seems  for the price they are not too bad. But you get what you pay for. Good Luck and Hoped this Helped</li>
    <li> i havent used these brushes myself but i gave them as a gift for christmas and my best friend loves them.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, and the case that came with, they are durable, usable, and do not shed (at least not yet) and respond to cleaning well.  Seller was prompt, and product arrived as shown.</li>
    <li> I got it for a friend she likes it, it is perfect for her I gave it to her for Christmas Present.</li>
    <li> FAKE, FAKE, FAKE! But I think they are still pretty decent brushes for the price. I will never buy a product from this seller again for selling fake MAC products. PEOPLE BEWARE MAC PRODUCTS DO NOT COME THIS CHEAP AND I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER MYSELF, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
    <li> I just got the Hello Kitty makeup brushes and they are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Highly  recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;The size a little too small ,but its my fault cause I didnt read the description , so if you want large size of brushes this is not for you other than that I am satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> I no it does say that they are MAC brushes but if u order them it says that they are on the brushes an the packaging but they are not real still pretty good for the price though</li>
    <li> These brushes are sold as MAC brushes, but they are not...despite that they are great brushes.  They are travel size which is great and they are very soft.  I don&#x27;t like that they&#x27;re being sold as something they&#x27;re not but they are good brushes.</li>
    <li> The product is okay, I did not like the foundation brush much because it leaves stroke mark. And there was a strong smell from the case but other than that it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> bottom line, cheap.&lt;br /&gt;the hello kitty logo looks like it was just super glued to the case, which the brushes don&#x27;t even fit properly into....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one of the brushes&#x27; head came off the handle as soon as I touched it.&lt;br /&gt;not a good buy.</li>
    <li> The brushes are obviously fake (did some research and MAC never released a 6 brush set from hello kitty only a 3) but i thought it was cute and wanted to try it. The brushes are not bad quality. In fact they are pretty soft and i have been using them for a few weeks and have had not shedding or breakage on them. For the price, i would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Nice little extra gift for daughter-in-law who happens to love Hello Kitty.  I loved the price as well.  Great bargain.</li>
    <li> these are not even mac brushes the real ones are like 50 bucks..but the only good thing about them is that they were shipped fast..the quality is terrible. i opened the case to look at the brushes and before i could even use them i slid the paper off the top of one of the brushes and the whole top of the brush came off with the paper..they are not as soft as i they should be since they are supposed to be \\&quot;MAC\\&quot;. dont buy them unless yu are giving them to your 4 year old.</li>
    <li> these are definitely high quality brushes contrary to some of the other reviews here. they work wonderfully and i&#x27;ve not had any of them shedding or falling apart on me at all. they&#x27;re perfect for taking to a friend&#x27;s house for a quick makeover or in an overnight bag</li>
    <li> My girlfriend requested this travel set based on two needs. First, she is a hello kitty nut and likes all of that stuff. Second, she needed a portable makeup brush set for when we travel. She says the brush quality is good.</li>
    <li> I recently got into using makeup. I have a sensitive skin and had just kept away from anything over cosmetic. I invested into good brand name makeup. After some careful review on amazon with many favorable products I decided on this set. The set arrived on time and like some reviewers have mentioned here and on other makeup brushes uses, I washed them with gentle soap before the first use. The brushes have been surprising good to use and hold shape well. There was some shedding in the first wash but none after that. As it goes with all make up brush care tips I wash the foundation brush as regularly as possibly and so far there has not been any problem with the integrity of the brush or shedding. I gave it 4 stars as I would have preferred a different set of brushes in the set as I don&#x27;t use all of them. Overall I would recommend this product for anyone looking a economic make brush option.</li>
    <li> I expected a little more out of this thing. It looks fake when I got it and I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> The case that these brushes come in smells really terrible. I&#x27;m not sure what the smell is, but it&#x27;s unpleasant. The brushes are nice, but you could find nice brushes and a better case for less.</li>
    <li> I really liked these brushes when I first started using them. They are soft, never scratchy, and apply makeup really well. BUT - after about 2 weeks of using them, the heads of the brushes started to fall off. The blush brush is completely in two pieces, and the eye liner brush - which I&#x27;ve never even used - is also in two pieces. I find this unacceptable for MAC brushes, even if they are only Hello Kitty travel brushes. Won&#x27;t be buying anything like this again. And the brush heads were so nice! Too bad.</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes are nice but others suck. No it os not real MAC but I didn&#x27;t mind. The problem with this particular brush set it that it often shed hairs all over your face. If one does not mind removing hairs then it is a good investment. Face it, it is a cheaper brush set and is fulfills the job it sets out to do. The lip brush, smaller angled brush, concealer brush, as well as the largest powder brush make the product worth purchasing; but the other two shed.&lt;br /&gt;It is okay</li>
    <li> My brushes came on time, I was so excited to open it and when I finally did it was just disappointment. First of all there not real mac hello kitty brushes. Second of all when I took them out the case one of the brushes head came off, but I decided to still keep them because I did not have any make up brushes. I usually wash brushes every two week a month later the contouring brush head came off, but thank god my boyfriend bought me a set of Mac brushes so I was fine.</li>
    <li> I can see, it&#x27;s not MAC. But it is cute. Your services, is good. But I wanted the real thang. So I will be still, looking for the real one, I will give this to my niece . Thank you, anyway.</li>
