      <li>Ruby Red Slippers on top!  </li>
      <li>This was an idea I got from another reviewer, and boy was it a HOT tip!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pricey mani, but baby you are SO worth it.  </li>
      <li>It was a little thinner than I expected like when you first put it on, but the end result is flawless :)</li>
      <li>Right.</li>
      <li>Nice on its own, and also makes a good opaque base color for designs/crackles.</li>
      <li>A second coat just seals the deal, and covers any spots you might have missed on the first pass; but honestly one coat will do you just fine; especially if you&#x27;re going to layer something else on top.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hands down, this is the best black polish I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The first time I ever got a China Glaze nail polish, it was this color, and I&#x27;m still amazed at how fast it dries.</li>

      <li>And it wasn&#x27;t very shiny on</li>
      <li>It really is a one-coater.</li>
      <li>its very shiny and goes on and one coat</li>
      <li>&amp; you put on the first coat (streaky) and the second coat (still streaky)</li>
      <li>I give this product a five star because when I received it was well packaged and when opened the nail polish wasent messed up nor old.  </li>
      <li>stamping-- no need to buy the special Konad black polish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but even when dry for hours when putting on topcoat the black smeared.  </li>
      <li>To get an even, streak free black I had to apply two coats, which is no big deal.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love the china glaze nail polish ,the color is good in single coat itself and does not smudge and stays on for a longer time</li>
    <li> Jet black polish. Great brand. Great lasting power. Pair with a matte top coat or seche vite. I haven&#x27;t owned black nail polish since high school. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Received the products earlier than expect. Bottles looks great and the brushes are in good condition. Cant wait to use them. Thx</li>
    <li> The picture  on the website show exactly how the color in your nails... beautiful and clean... please order this color! it looks hot for this Halloween!</li>
    <li> I give this product a five star because when I received it was well packaged and when opened the nail polish wasent messed up nor old.  I also love this brand.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Started buying a few nail polishes online.  This is the best, shiny, and in just one or two coats.  Smooooth. Luv it.</li>

A second coat just seals the deal, and covers any spots you might have missed on the first pass; but honestly one coat will do you just fine; especially if you&#x27;re going to layer something else on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this stuff looks fantastic on it&#x27;s own - but you HAVE to try Ruby Red Slippers [[ASIN:B000WBK994 deborah lippmann Nail Lacquer, Ruby Red Slippers]] on top of it.  This was an idea I got from another reviewer, and boy was it a HOT tip!  I used one single coat of Liquid Leather, 2 coats of Ruby Red Slippers, and topped it all with one coat of [[ASIN:B003YNB752 [Nubar] T309 Diamont Seal &amp; Shine Top Coat]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pricey mani, but baby you are SO worth it.

    <li> For many years I have been wearing black, from the cheapest to expensive brands.  This one by China Glaze is the BEST black out there.</li>
    <li> I love the China Glaze products. This is really black. I will probably use it for designing. I tried it as as polish and it is hard to remove around the cuticles when wanting to switch the color.</li>
    <li> True to color, goes on smooth, works great with other nail polish base/top coats. I Love all China Glaze nail polish.</li>
    <li> Thick black only have to do one or two coats, didn&#x27;t leave any staining. I use it with Konad stampers and it shows up  quite well.</li>
    <li> What a perfect black polish! It really is a one-coater. Nice on its own, and also makes a good opaque base color for designs/crackles. In my experience it also works well for Konad stamping-- no need to buy the special Konad black polish.</li>
    <li> The first time I ever got a China Glaze nail polish, it was this color, and I&#x27;m still amazed at how fast it dries. I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to buy China Glaze. It may be expensive to some but it really is worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Hands down, this is the best black polish I have ever used. You know when you get into one of those moods, and yr like \\&quot;Im totally getting this [insert drug store name] black polish, and im totally gonna rock it\\&quot; then you get it home &amp; you put on the first coat (streaky) and the second coat (still streaky) and so on an so on, until you have a thick goopy mess on yr hands? Yeah, this polish doesnt do that. One Coat (maybe two in some spots) will get you done in no time. Maybe yr thinking to yrself \\&quot;I would never NEVER wear just black polish-ew.\\&quot; Well guess what? you still need a black polish in yr arsenal to do adorable accents like stripes or chevrons or whatever, so you might as well get the best, right? Right.</li>

    <li> Ruby Red Slippers on top!  It is so goth, so artsy, so damn beautiful.  It appears as if you will have to reach thru five layers of glass to get to the gitter! SO HAUTE !!!!</li>
    <li> It was a little thinner than I expected like when you first put it on, but the end result is flawless :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but even when dry for hours when putting on topcoat the black smeared.  And it wasn&#x27;t very shiny on it&#x27;s own.  My first experience with China Glaze-not impressed.</li>
