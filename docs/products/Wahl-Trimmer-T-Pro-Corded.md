      <li>These Trimmers are ok, not horrible but not that great.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, these are great for quick shaving.</li>
      <li>i bought them for my husband and he loves them they make triming his goatee very easy.</li>
      <li>Good for a quick cut!</li>
      <li>but since the shave is so close do expect some bumps but should be fine if you have some good aftershave.</li>
      <li>I would liked it to have more clips included,but you can always buy them seperatly.</li>
      <li>gets nice and close to the skin, and when going around ears i find myself being able to get all the hair with accidentally taking a chunk out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have gladly gave it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>This one is just ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done several jobs since it arrived, and beautiful!  </li>
      <li>Blade could cut better but it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I wish it had more attachments or an adjustable one.</li>
      <li>your ok or if you use it for a beard</li>
      <li>I may look into a cordless model, that would be even better.</li>
      <li>then I laugh cuz the pro t trimmer are jus that good</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d buy them again, but I went ahead and paid a bit more for the 5-Star Trimmers also by Wahl - hopefully they can withstand an accidental 2.5 foot drop.</li>
      <li>Its corded and not battery powered which I love.</li>
      <li>shipped fast, works great</li>
      <li>I bought it, used it, and realized that for cutting/trimming hair, buying a pair of tweezers would have been a better use of my money.</li>
      <li>so the trimmer needs to be tilted more than I am used to.</li>
      <li>the reason i gave it 3 stars is because it doesnt cut that good.i chose to buy this because i figured because it was corded that it would cut better then</li>
      <li>Better than battery powered ones for sure</li>
      <li>your ok.  </li>
      <li>He is also well pleased, with the close shaving it does.  </li>
      <li>for how much you&#x27;re paying this works great.</li>
      <li>Much better than the rechargable battery type.</li>
      <li>These are great for quick shaves and quick maintenance of haircuts and linings.</li>

      <li>Pretty good trimmer.</li>

      <li>The body is really light, the power cable is very cheap, it uses a AC adapter.&lt;br /&gt;only</li>
      <li>I just bought this trimmer, its very light weight and also light in power.  </li>
      <li>Was happy with it so far</li>

      <li>Easy to travel with.</li>
      <li>My return was processed easily.</li>
      <li>Thank you for sending me this Pro Trimmer  its easy to use</li>
      <li>Lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This is a small but great great pair of trimmers.. works good on soft fades, light weigh will put it to the test in weeks to come.</li>
      <li>The first two I purchased were battery powered which I liked</li>
      <li>works fine shaving my face</li>
      <li>In my opinion, the best shaver  for black men.</li>
      <li>Light weight and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Trimmer is very sharp, and are excellent for bump free shaving.</li>
      <li>However, good typical cuts in Wahl and promises to be durable for their good finishes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works very good on my husband&#x27;s and sons head</li>
    <li> Blade could cut better but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Very dull,,, cant even trim my mustache... i regret buying this thing, don&#x27;t waste your money, take my word or you will too</li>
    <li> I bought this from Burlington Coat Factory in the 727 **IT  COULD NOT CUT THRU MY HAIR (FACIAL)**  I tested the shaver on my arm no problem. Its not for me I returned it. I may try another Wahl (PRO) procduct. This in my opinion is not a pro trimmer.</li>
    <li> This has changed everything, I break out in bumps frequently after using a safety razor.  Even fresh new packs, this Trimmer allows me to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; every other day or so, and my face is much, much, smoother.  Will not be returning to razors anytime soon, even though it was a closer shave, the irritation isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as nicely as I would think.  It takes a couple of passes to get the hair cut.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son and he loves it.  It is as advertised and I would certainly purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Toy, am not sure Wahl actually made this, or some Chinese guy in his backyard manufactured and slapped WHAL on it. Buyer Beware</li>
    <li> I just bought this trimmer, its very light weight and also light in power.  It does cut the hair, but i have to go over the area again, to get it clean.</li>
    <li> Great for the price.  Not barber shop fresh because those are professional clippers but definitely do a good job.  People will still notice that you got lined up haha</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Sharp blades. The only drawback is that it is a little hard to hold it at the right angle when using it on yourself. The blades are sloped back from the front of the trimmer so the trimmer needs to be tilted more than I am used to. It&#x27;s hard to see where the blades are when using it on yourself.</li>
    <li> My husband was thrilled, when he saw that I purchased, this complete Trimmer and Grooming Set for him.  He loves the fact that it is so light and compact.  He is also well pleased, with the close shaving it does.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed, if you make this purchase.</li>
    <li> Does the job but wish it cut a little more crisp on the lines</li>
    <li> I had mine for about a year or so from Target, mine came in gold and black. Was happy with it so far but now it vibrates and makes a lot of noise. I don&#x27;t want to throw it away and I wanted to return it to Target but I threw away the box and receipt after 90 days of ownership. So, when it works it&#x27;s good, the problem is that it breaks too soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer!  Worked well out of the box and has a nice long cord!  Very sharp. Is a bit on the loud side.</li>
    <li> Nice little corded trimmer.  Much better than the rechargable battery type.</li>
    <li> Good set of trimmers. As the other reviews have stated, the blades are a bit on the sharper side which will be good in the long run. But you have to be careful when you use them, I&#x27;ve already cut myself once. I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase though. Good price, good quality.</li>
    <li> In a small trimmer for mustache, all I had been able to find were battery powered, with inadequate rechargeable batteries.  Happy to find a nice corded unit.</li>
    <li> great little might mouse!!!</li>
    <li> My trimmers are awesome I recommend them very highly.</li>
    <li> Blades already seem to be dull, will spend a little more money next time and get a good one or just go back to the cheap ones. What a disappointment, heard a lot about this product but does not live up to the hype.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:a8c3137f3434089098388c015d07c697]] This short video will give you a good idea of why I gave this T-trimmer 3 stars. I hope you find it helpful.</li>
    <li> Product is definitely worth the selling price, however power output is low. Trimmer appears to be designed to provide just enough power to get the job done, no more.  When overall current usage by neighborhood is high (workday mornings), the power outpput is noticeaby lower, and it takes a little longer to get a clean shave. However, it does provide more power than the cordless trimmers/shavers that I&#x27;ve used in the past. Other than this, I really like the product and think it&#x27;s definitely worth it&#x27;s selling price. I will by another one when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Crude, ineffective, fails to trim or shave smoothly and also wounds the skin of the user because of the squared-off sharp edges</li>
    <li> This is my third Wahl&#x27;s Groomsman, the other two broke due to my own fault. This product is so good to my face that I&#x27;ve order another one. Like many black males I&#x27;ve had major issues with ingrown hair after shaving, after hours of research I decided to purchase the Wahl Groomsman/ T Pro and it is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever purchased, I&#x27;m on my third one like I mentioned. This shaver doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a traditional shave ( which is what causes the ingrown hairs anyway) but it cuts close enough to give that close shave look minus the ingrown hair. The first two I purchased were battery powered which I liked but I came to the realization I really don&#x27;t need a battery powered razor as I only shave in my bathroom and I&#x27;ve got tons of plugs in there so I opted for the corded version which guarantees continuous power all the time. This line of shavers is a must have for all those who suffer from ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> This product was a complete let down. Chews up necks, and leaves red marks. Blades are too sharp, and its very loud.</li>
    <li> It is now 4 years old and I find it still works a good as it was when new!!!</li>
    <li> Not as heavy duty as I had hoped when using in a professional capacity.  But work well for the price paid.</li>
    <li> Scratches skin. Cheap. Doesn&#x27;t trim close at all.</li>
    <li> It does not cut as well as advertised. This trimmer is lightweight and flimsy and does not have that durable feel of the professional trimmers. I wanted to like it but it just did not cut well at all.</li>
    <li> Great razor on it very sharp n percise wit the edging I used it to shave my head  AMD trim my beard and every one ask wen do I have tyme for a babrber then I laugh cuz the pro t trimmer are jus that good</li>
    <li> Blade broke first week I used it.. Motor is pedestrian at best.</li>
    <li> shipped fast, works great</li>
    <li> I bought it, used it, and realized that for cutting/trimming hair, buying a pair of tweezers would have been a better use of my money. It is way too small, it&#x27;s dull, and has almost no power. When I used it, it felt like it was simply pulling the hairs out. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Wahl 9307-300 T-Pro Trimmer ...All is good. TKS.</li>
    <li> Make sure you read package details carefully. It did look like a well built item.  My return was processed easily.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. More powerful than any chargeable wireless or battery operated trimmer, but it&#x27;s not irritating. The wide blade helps cover more area so it takes less time to shave.</li>
    <li> The product itself is good if you are not taping or balding your hair.The shipment and delivery was very fast. I would recommend the seller but not not the product.</li>
    <li> it works like a champ, hope that it lasts. I may look into a cordless model, that would be even better.</li>
    <li> Light weight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The lettering on outside of the box reads \\&quot;Shop Tool\\&quot; suggesting this is a professional use or quality product. However, after I received it and upon inspection, this Wahl Trimmer is not built to last or have the grit to perform regularly in a barber shop. I&#x27;m so disappointed, Wahl makes quality products, but this item is just a toy.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a product to line up, this is not it. The blades are very dull, not alot of power. It was really a waste of money, i end up having to purchase another trimmer.</li>
    <li> I just got this and its better then what i thought only thing weird and stupid about this is the plug is so big which make no sense cause the trimmers are small haha, but i used these to cut my hair on my head, underarm, and genitals areas.</li>
    <li> My cordless Remington had stopped holding a charge, and since I was usually just using the popup beard trimmer on the back to shave down to a reasonable stubble (using a blade razor for anything closer), I hoped this would replace that function. My facial hair is thin and relatively light and still this did close to nothing. After ten minutes with it, I gave up and went back to my nearly dead razor, which did the job better even at a quarter of its normal power.</li>
    <li> smaller than expected ,,but very good</li>
    <li> This trimmer is much smaller and less powerful than what I thought I was buying.  The trimming razor is very small.</li>
    <li> These clippers promise a bump-free shave, and that may be true. The reason the shave is bump-free is because this trimmer does not cut nearly close enough. After doing half of my face, I switched back to my cheap, basic Conairs, which give a much closer shave. These are not sharp enough to outline a mustache and will pull on curly hairs. Overall, would NOT buy again!</li>
    <li> This trimmer gets the job done. It&#x27;s not the closest cut but if you looking to save some money and maintain your look you should be satisified.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on a review that I read here. The clippers are made for&lt;br /&gt;Black Americans hair. I get a close shave without the razor bumps every time.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it gets 4 stars is the power cord is huge. If it had&#x27;ve been less power&lt;br /&gt;cord or rechargeable I&#x27;d have gladly gave it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband chose this, and he really likes it.  He uses it a lot and is happy with the power, etc.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2MV4PCTPLVPBE]]This is a very good trimmer kit. Its corded and not battery powered which I love. I feel like the battery powered trimmers quickly lose charge and gives you a less than optimal shave. I mainly use this for detail and lineup work and to shape up my goatee/mustache. When I do use it as a quick shave it works well but it does not get as close a shave as a razor or even my electric shavers. As an african american with coarse curly hair, all trimmers/shavers don&#x27;t work great for me (many are best used on fine hair), but these work well for me. The unit is a good size/weight and fits nice in the palm of your hand. I like the larger brush that comes with it. You can either use it as a beard brush or a cleaning brush. Since I have alot of small brushes for my other clippers, I use this as a beard brush since its the only brush I have of this size (and its easier than using a larger hair brush). I will say one thing that slightly annoys me is the size of the plug. its a little large for such a small device and I have to unplug other things to get it to fit in the electrical socket (or plug it in upside down). Not a huge problem but a minor annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What comes in the box:&lt;br /&gt;1 trimmer w/corded plug&lt;br /&gt;3 guides (1/8th, 1/4th, and 3/8th)&lt;br /&gt;1 beard brush&lt;br /&gt;1 comb&lt;br /&gt;1 small bottle of blade oil</li>
    <li> I bought this to fend off ingrown hairs which I&#x27;ve struggled with my whole life. I&#x27;ve try all types of razors, wet and dry, I&#x27;ve grown a full fledged beard. Nothing seemed to work well. With this trimmer I get a close enough shave without getting too close to my skin. I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about a month, and I can certainly tell the difference. Thank you Wahl for making a device that works for curly haired men!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for in a beard trimmer. Easy to travel with. If your looking for something just to trim and shape your beard this is what you need.</li>
    <li> I hard battery powered devices that I only use in my home.  A little small but good power, long cord, does he job.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a little bit of the Don Johnson grizzled look [from Miami Vice, if you&#x27;re old enough to remember that], you can use this in place of shaving every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, this is a great alternative to shaving every day.</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending me this Pro Trimmer  its easy to use</li>
    <li> Pretty good trimmer. Not barber shop quality but does the job. It small in my hand but grips well. I wish it had more attachments or an adjustable one.</li>
    <li> im happy with it great price as well nice device very sharp cuts well makes for good grooming will recommend</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as rapidly as I&#x27;d like when trimming a thick beard.  Quite small in your hand ... otherwise it works well and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done several jobs since it arrived, and beautiful!  I had a pair of $75 Andis, which I broke, so last minute effort had me try these.  The weight and durable feel is definitely not there, but the results are.  Word of advice.. Nothing this important should ever take a counter high fall, period.  I&#x27;ll keep these even after I buy another pair of And is.</li>
    <li> These are great. i bought them for my husband and he loves them they make triming his goatee very easy.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut close enough,</li>
    <li> Love,them not to big n good for shaving</li>
    <li> Good trimmer for the money. I would have preferred a little better selection of guards but overall it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Was as sharp as I expected no regrets.</li>
    <li> The best shaver .... I purchased 2</li>
    <li> Good trimmers. Sharp enough to get the job done. Close facial cutting and makes smooth, sharp lines and parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was wrapping up my primary set of clippers (Andis Pro Motor), the cables got a little tangled, and these trimmers took a fall from the counter, hitting the floor - they didn&#x27;t work after that. Lasted a good 10 months though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy them again, but I went ahead and paid a bit more for the 5-Star Trimmers also by Wahl - hopefully they can withstand an accidental 2.5 foot drop. I&#x27;ll be more careful though, lol.</li>
    <li> Good Product wrong color received</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something just to trim beard/hair, this is it. It&#x27;s not to sharp and crisp on lining/edging up hairline.</li>
    <li> Thank U great light weight good</li>
    <li> This is great and would make a perfect gift for any man that has facial hair; lightweight, corded,, and handy.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer to groom facial hair!</li>
    <li> Works great ! Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> While this trimmer works well enough, the older version of the same model worked much better.  I&#x27;m curious if they changed the construction of these or if I just received a dud.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent probably over 2 grand to get rid of my ingrown hairs over the past year. Laser, pfb razor, creams etc. I let my beard grow out for 2-3 weeks then used this. My ingrown hairs are gone. Take my advice buy this or a product like it you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I tried to trim my beard &amp; the blades were dull &amp; did not trim at all.  The shaver is Very noisy</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son-in-law to use in a barber shop cutting hair and he loves it and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price anywhere else.</li>
    <li> This is a micro clipper small / compact not a lot of power. I was thrown off by the Pro in the name, don&#x27;t think a pro would use these trimmers?  Amazon transaction went well and the deal went well.</li>
    <li> Great Beard Trimmer, Easy to Handle</li>
    <li> This is my second pair of trimmers with this brand and style.  I tend to use them regularly between two little boys and an adult.  The trimmer will get a lot of work at my home.  Light weight, great balance, and packes well for business/leisure trips.  It outlasted its warranty and price.  Great buy any day.</li>
    <li> Well, not exactly advertised on the photo (a golden color). The one that came to me is metallic red. However, good typical cuts in Wahl and promises to be durable for their good finishes</li>
    <li> This item was exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
    <li> These Trimmers are ok, not horrible but not that great.  Some pulling</li>
    <li> If youre buying this as a cheap solution to the Andis T Liners, then you might as well spend the extra $20-30 for the  Andis trimmers. These are not bad at all, but they do not get close to the sharp linings you would get from the Andis. These are excellent for shaving your facial hair down and come with few different sizing options. These are great for quick shaves and quick maintenance of haircuts and linings. But these don&#x27;t cut as close as the Andis and therefore do not give you a very crisp long lasting lining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note the trimmer itself is actually pretty small and lightweight, so its pretty easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want sharp linings, spend the extra money. Otherwise, these are great for quick shaving.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and I got the after I broke my expensive pair. I thought that they would hold me over until I could get another  good pair but they were super loud. They sounded like I was tattooing people. I&#x27;m going to use on My dog. They were cheap, so I&#x27;m not disappointed but these tremors deserves more than three stars and that&#x27;s me being super nice because I like Amazon</li>
    <li> Awful DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Compact, good for travel...good deal.</li>
    <li> The wahl was great it did what it was supposed to do, and did it well. I would liked it to have more clips included,but you can always buy them seperatly.</li>
    <li> Not compatible with the Australian power supply. Therefore could not use as it is expensive to buy a power converter.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work out of the box! So frustrating.</li>
    <li> Great job as a trimmer but my ears literally RING after using this- on my boys- who complain that it&#x27;s sonic jet loud!</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the closeness I get on necklines,but its quieter than most of the trimmers Ive had. It does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> This is a good cutting machine, the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;BUT it is cheap. The body is really light, the power cable is very cheap, it uses a AC adapter.&lt;br /&gt;only for home use, it has 3 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;For the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I love this product works great.</li>
    <li> Works well. but it was smaller than I expected.  I use it to cut my husbands hair about twice a month.</li>
    <li> works well, doesnt come with a longer setting. I like corded trimmers because almost always the batteries dies</li>
    <li> So loud. I wish itd cut closer and be adjustable</li>
    <li> They are horrible if are detailing they are only good for shaving and they barely cut in that department please just buy andis</li>
    <li> He said he like them they have a good cut .</li>
    <li> for how much you&#x27;re paying this works great. works fine shaving my face but since the shave is so close do expect some bumps but should be fine if you have some good aftershave.</li>
    <li> Fantastic piece of equipment.  Trimmed like a champ, effortless.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent item</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim as fast it takes a while but great choice for a beginner. Starting to get better and better.</li>
    <li> Small enough to use on beards and very powerful. Great quality and no battery to worry about going dead in the middle of trimming your hair.</li>
    <li> Gift for father-in - law and he seems happy with it. It must work or we would never hearthe end.of it!</li>
    <li> This is a small but great great pair of trimmers.. works good on soft fades, light weigh will put it to the test in weeks to come.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaver that i can use &amp; shave in any direction &amp; don&#x27;t  get  razor bumps. In my opinion, the best shaver  for black men.</li>
    <li> THE TRIMMERS WORK PRETTY GOOD AND I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE TO PUT THEM ON A CHARGER, JUST PLUG THEM UP. PRETTY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Better than battery powered ones for sure</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. The beard grows slower and the skin feels smoother.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is very sharp, and are excellent for bump free shaving.</li>
    <li> Good for a quick cut! Nice for shape ups and keeping your hair nice for a special event or everyday use!</li>
    <li> The item was not as effective as i expected and i thought that the trimmers would be sharper</li>
    <li> So far so good. I use them to trim my beard. They work well.  Have not had probelms. I enjoy the beard brush.</li>
    <li> Good buy for the money</li>
    <li> Way too loud, when I&#x27;m trimming around my ear i feel like im gonna go deaf because of it otherwise it&#x27;s a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> made in china.. debil al cortar!</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk.  I purchased one one-month ago.  After five uses it already does not trim hair.  I&#x27;m very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Read several reviews about this and the Andis trimmer models. I chose this for the price point. I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with other Wahl products and decided to pull the trigger after my portable battery powered Wahl trimmer bit the dust. Works well, easy to use, and seems like the usual Wahl quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 9/19/2013&lt;br /&gt;Rust! I keep this in my bathroom, wrapped in a plastic bag, and it has rust after only a few days.I even oiled &amp; cleaned it before I stored it after use.&lt;br /&gt;Really Wahl? I expected a lot more from this product. Guess i&#x27;ll be getting an Andis whenever this one dies.</li>
    <li> the reason i gave it 3 stars is because it doesnt cut that good.i chose to buy this because i figured because it was corded that it would cut better then my battery operated shaver but i was wrong.the batter operated machine actually cuts much closer.so if you dont have money to spend and this is a quick fix then i suggest you get but if you have another 10 or 20 bucks i suggest you get something else.if you can,get the wahl peanut,that is a really good product.</li>
    <li> Awesome trimmer.  Gives me a close cut and helps keep me looking sharp.  Lightweight and easy to use.  I&#x27;ve used wireless trimmers in the past, but those are such hassles.  Definitely don&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I wanted a trimmer to quickly trim my face when I didn&#x27;t feel like shaving. I can&#x27;t comment on how it does for outlining hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t nick my face, so I can use it to shave my beard down to stubble. Zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;- Has a cord, so you don&#x27;t waste batteries (could be a Con if you wanted something more portable)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t cut super well. Takes a couple of passes to trim every hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t cut all that close. Still leaves my a good length of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;- Noisy. I have another, bigger electric clippers that makes more of a loud hum. This screeches like a cheap electric toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to make the purchase again, I&#x27;d probably spend a little more and go with a $40-50 choice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s loud as hell.  I had a Wahl trimmer that had a white and had different colored attachments it died mid haircut.  Other than that Loved it.  I couldn&#x27;t find that model so I bought this one.  This one is just ok. I basically shave my head and this thing takes forever.  You really have to go slow if you have a weeks worth of growth.  If you cut your hair every other day your ok or if you use it for a beard your ok.  Also don&#x27;t trim around your years cause it&#x27;s loud as hell.  My full size Wahl isn&#x27;t as loud.</li>
    <li> worked great for the first 3 times then it started pulling my hair then eventually stopped cutting my hair at all</li>
    <li> Better than what I expected... awesome piece!</li>
    <li> Arrived damaged. I had to return it. I am not asking for replacement.</li>
    <li> the best add on to my in home haircut set.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best t-blade trimmers I have ever used. I previously had the groomsman but it didn&#x27;t cut as clean as this one. For a clean and crispy cut buy this.</li>
    <li> use it everyday as a hairstylist. gets nice and close to the skin, and when going around ears i find myself being able to get all the hair with accidentally taking a chunk out.</li>
