      <li>Totaly satisfied!!</li>
      <li>I used it without putting oil and it wouldn&#x27;t cut really good, then i put some oil and it cut like a champ.</li>
      <li>It is a good trimmer.</li>
      <li>So I purchased the Andis outliner 2 which does just as good of job without the bruising.</li>
      <li>and i think this was a good buy.</li>
      <li>I zero gapped too and are the best out in the market worth every dollar.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the product...</li>
      <li>First, I believe Andis makes the best trimmers on the market.  </li>
      <li>I own this clipper for 8 months now.</li>
      <li>I own an Andis Styliner M3 and an Oster T-Finisher.</li>
      <li>I have cut my own hair since I was a teenager</li>
      <li>I own the T-Edjer, Outliner, and now I own these, Styliner M3&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Worked great right out of the box!</li>
      <li>Very good trimmer not as loud as its twin the styliner 2 but cuts equally as good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought Wahl trimmers, Oster, etc., but Andis by far are the best.  </li>
      <li>Styliner II is a much better</li>
      <li>I love them.  </li>
      <li>I love the feel of the housing.</li>
      <li>more power is directed to the blade according to the features of the clipper.</li>
      <li>There are many blade alignment techniques out there, find one you can apply.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is a reason that the Andis Styliner II is the number one favorite among barbers and hair stylists.  </li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?  </li>
      <li>All right I got it everything good</li>
      <li>Great machine does the job well highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The Andis Styliner M3 is more powerful and cuts more easily than the Oster T-Finisher.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
      <li>they are easy to handle</li>
      <li>Absolutely blown away by the power of this device, and it&#x27;s very comfortable on the skin, five stars!</li>
      <li>I  am really enjoying  the smooth clean cut  </li>
      <li>Sturdy, easy to hold and precise.</li>
      <li>The M3 does have less vibration and has a great feel and looks amazing.</li>
      <li>We wanted it to be powerful, yet smooth on the skin so you could easily, and safely use it on your neck.</li>
      <li>The screws even seem cheap on the Pro Mate blade.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quieter, lighter, cooler, and 50% more powerful.  </li>
      <li>(I assume that means 50% more powerful than the Andis Styliner 2).</li>
      <li>This is truly a great product and worth the money as I&#x27;m sure this will last me for years to come.</li>
      <li>Its supposed to be 50% more powerful</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional barber and these are by far the best liners I have ever used.</li>
      <li>These trimmers are good for childrens heads with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but I can tell that its more powerful because they are both very powerful.</li>
      <li>I used to use the Andis styleliner II, but these are noticably more powerful and the metal case is much sturdier and has a better feel than the plastic.  </li>
      <li>So, after days of trying and trying, I finally got them aligned perfectly, but they still do not cut better than the traditional Andis Outliner and Outliner II&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I have already all the other liners that they say are the best, but these ones are far better..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true what they say, you get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>I have shopped around for a good unit to shave/trim my beard with for years, repeatedly buying cheaper units made specifically for trimming facial hair.</li>
      <li>I like the way this trimmer stays cool</li>
      <li>Not a bad trimmer, but doesn&#x27;t cut as close as the Outliners.  </li>
      <li>This is a perfect one for professional barber whom specially working for military hair cuts and I recommended it.</li>
      <li>I am sure it will keep going for several more years.</li>
      <li>But the Andis Styliner M3 becomes very hot after about 15-20 minutes of continuous use.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with purchase, a step above my Styliner 2&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>The shipment process was what i expected,  I knew this would be a good product to purchase and was excited when i received it.</li>
      <li>An exellent machine they recommend, the engine is very fast!</li>
      <li>Better yet get the Andis gtx with the new blade.  </li>
      <li>so it is worth it</li>
      <li>no newbe, ive been a barber for over 20 yrs and cant get these right</li>
      <li>The fit is better than I had expected, I like the heft of it a lot.</li>
      <li>I suspect that oiling religiously and maintaining a sharp cutter will keep it working like new for a great many years to come.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know what came over me when I purchased this trimmer?!?</li>
      <li>The styliner M3 gives me a pretty close shave and doesn&#x27;t result in razor bumps.</li>
      <li>The quality of the standard Andis blade is much better and</li>
      <li>I used these trimmers last night and was pleased with the results</li>
      <li>It is not the same as the Styliner II, to me this is a much better trimmer.</li>
      <li>, before buying any trimmer or clipper Youtube them first, as this will let you know what the product is like before you buy it.  </li>
      <li>I bought the first about 5 yrs ago.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot in the time I use it either.</li>
      <li>Price is high but it is worthy to be deserved.</li>
      <li>Run cool, cut extremely close to the skin, it has an amazing power I highly recommend this trimmer and fast shipping</li>
      <li>I freaking love this thing and am so glad that I spent the extra money to get it.  </li>
      <li>I really hope this review helps people who are interested in buying these trimmers.  </li>
      <li>This little machine cuts very good as long as you keep it oiled, remember that!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in the shop every day for about a month now, it has never failed to leave a crisp, clean line in any texture of hair -- yet is gentle enough for a child&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>The trimmer did a great job but later my skin would become slightly irritated.</li>
      <li>Wahl products are easy to use but still very reliable and will definitely get the job done.  </li>
      <li>Edges really close without scarring</li>
      <li>They almost don&#x27;t  heat up (as the Styliner M3s do) and they&#x27;re much lighter in weight.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> cannot get it to cut like it should.not happy with this clipper</li>
    <li> This is the second pair of this edger I have owned. Edges really close without scarring and they are very quiet. Low price on Amazon but do not buy at the store because you will overpay. It&#x27;s worth the extra to get these trimmers.</li>
    <li> it does not give you the cleanest line up but it gets the job done. so it is worth it</li>
    <li> way to heavy, the blade was chipped and they r hard to adjust. im no newbe, ive been a barber for over 20 yrs and cant get these right</li>
    <li> One of the Best trimmers..@20 years a&lt;br /&gt;Barber</li>
    <li> An exellent machine they recommend, the engine is very fast! Totaly satisfied!!</li>
    <li> We were looking for a trimmer that was as close to the barbershop one as possible. We wanted it to be powerful, yet smooth on the skin so you could easily, and safely use it on your neck. Absolutely blown away by the power of this device, and it&#x27;s very comfortable on the skin, five stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Andis clippers/trimmers since 1998, and this is the best product yet. With the previous clippers that I used such as the T-Outliner and Styliner II, I would have to go over the same area twice or more to get that precise line or shave and would end up with razor burn and red marks, due to my sensitive skin. With the M3, I  really only need to go over the area once, whether it&#x27;s lining myself up or dry shaving and no razor burn. You can also adjust the blade to make it cut even closer. This is truly a great product and worth the money as I&#x27;m sure this will last me for years to come.</li>
    <li> First, I believe Andis makes the best trimmers on the market.  I&#x27;ve bought Wahl trimmers, Oster, etc., but Andis by far are the best.  I own the T-Edjer, Outliner, and now I own these, Styliner M3&#x27;s.  I debated on whether I should get the new Andis Superliner or these, and I concluded that I&#x27;ll get the Styliner M3 because of the magnesium body, powerful motor, and I thought since they were Andis most expensive trimmers that they&#x27;d be worth the money.  I am not satisfied nor am I dissatisfied with the Styliner M3.  You will have to adjust them if you want a razor sharp outline.  The difficulty is adjust the trimmers blades.  I&#x27;ve been adjust trimmers for a while and it was very difficult to zero gap these.  It was hard to get the cutting blade to be perfectly aligned with the guide blade.  I took them to an Andis authorized repair shop and they adjusted them for me, but they would not and did not zero gap them.  So, after days of trying and trying, I finally got them aligned perfectly, but they still do not cut better than the traditional Andis Outliner and Outliner II&#x27;s.  I wish I would&#x27;ve bought the Superliners witht the detachable blade.  I still use my Andis Outliners after I use the M3&#x27;s because my clients say that they don&#x27;t get close enough.  I&#x27;m looking for a sucker that&#x27;ll take these off my hands and give me at least $50 for them, so I can buy and try the Superliners.  And oh, I also bought the Pro Mate blade with these trimmers...those blades SUCK!  The quality of the standard Andis blade is much better and Pro Mate.  The screws even seem cheap on the Pro Mate blade.  I really hope this review helps people who are interested in buying these trimmers.  Not a bad trimmer, but doesn&#x27;t cut as close as the Outliners.  So, if you like your tirmmer blades so close that you can almost saw into someones skull, don&#x27;t get these.  These trimmers are good for childrens heads with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I own an Andis Styliner M3 and an Oster T-Finisher. The Andis Styliner M3 is more powerful and cuts more easily than the Oster T-Finisher. But the Andis Styliner M3 becomes very hot after about 15-20 minutes of continuous use. This seems to be a common problem with Andis trimmers. Currently, I use the Andis Styliner M3 until it becomes too hot, and then I switch to the Oster T-Finisher.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase, a step above my Styliner 2&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This clipper is not worth the money, just get a styliner II for 40$, It&#x27;s the same clipper.  Better yet get the Andis gtx with the new blade.  I had to put a piece of flash card paper on the power switch to stop the switch from rattling. Worst 70$ investment ever... smh Don&#x27;t you dare put this in you cart!</li>
    <li> When adjusted properly these are a great pair of trimmers they can be a little noisy but there is no denying the crisp &amp; tight line up you can achieve with these trimmers.</li>
    <li> I purchased the trimmer to give myself a baldy cut. The trimmer did a great job but later my skin would become slightly irritated. After using the trimmer 5 or 6 times I noticed the back of my neck, just below my hairline was darker than the rest of my skin which indicated my skin was being bruised. So I purchased the Andis outliner 2 which does just as good of job without the bruising.</li>
    <li> This is the best of the best.  It&#x27;s true what they say, you get what you pay for.  I have tried just about every trimmer out there and let me tell you this one stands above the rest. Even the other Andis trimmers with the same T-Blade can&#x27;t compare.  There is a reason that the Andis Styliner II is the number one favorite among barbers and hair stylists.  With the introduction of the M3 Andis has taken it a step further.  It&#x27;s quieter, lighter, cooler, and 50% more powerful.  What more could you ask for?  I freaking love this thing and am so glad that I spent the extra money to get it.  If you&#x27;ve got the money, go for it.  Trust me you will not regret it.  This baby really is a cut above the rest.</li>
    <li> This little machine cuts very good as long as you keep it oiled, remember that! When you get it out of the box oil it. I used it without putting oil and it wouldn&#x27;t cut really good, then i put some oil and it cut like a champ.</li>
    <li> I bought these with the impression they gave a decent line up. They are above average. The worst part is the deafening noise they scream in your ear. It takes some tweaking.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for completing barber school! Barber luvs an an still uses it to date! He says he would def recommend! Fast shipn from seller</li>
    <li> Best trimmers I ever used!</li>
    <li> Vibrates too much and too noisy.</li>
    <li> This buzzer is very heavy and dont cut as well as my quiet Oster. So it only made sense to return it.</li>
    <li> Very good and helpfull</li>
    <li> Great clippers. A+ product and great for line ups.</li>
    <li> Was at my house before the set date .</li>
    <li> After a number of years, I decided to upgrade the Wahls barber set I bought at Target. What a difference in terms of its ability to trim hair. Sturdy, easy to hold and precise.</li>
    <li> It is a good trimmer. Its supposed to be 50% more powerful (I assume that means 50% more powerful than the Andis Styliner 2). Its is quiter than the Styliner 2 but I can tell that its more powerful because they are both very powerful. The M3 does have less vibration and has a great feel and looks amazing. It cuts great. But its actually the same clipper as the Styliner 2. The M3 just has premium housing and is great looking. The both have a 15 watt motor. But because the of the housing on the M3 which has less&lt;br /&gt;vibration more power is directed to the blade according to the features of the clipper. But as I said its hard to tell. They Styliner seems to perform just as well delivering sharp edge-ups and shaving effortlessly. So for the price of this clipper I probably would not buy this over the Styliner 2. Oh and this clipper is heavier than the Styliner. Actually it seems heavier than a trimmer needs to be. Its a great addition if your adding to a collection of clipper (like if your a barber or collect clippers) but its not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have used it 3 times since receiving it. I use it to shave since shaving with a razor gives me shaving bumps and I can&#x27;t shave for a few days after shaving with a razor. The styliner M3 gives me a pretty close shave and doesn&#x27;t result in razor bumps.</li>
    <li> The shipment process was what i expected,  I knew this would be a good product to purchase and was excited when i received it.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know what came over me when I purchased this trimmer?!?! I&#x27;m not a fan of the styliners due to the fact that it&#x27;s always so hard for me to balance out the blade and get equal power withy that screw on the side. But I took a chance and got this m3 because of the look and how it feels in my hand. Again the frustration mounds with the blade adjustment. So I would recommend to just buy a regular t outliner especially if you&#x27;d like to just grab the machine right out of the box and go to work!!!</li>
    <li> I own this clipper for 8 months now. I must say It cuts like a champ then and even now, but the clipper are so loud you cant have a conversation because is so loud it make me lose conversation. Its embarrassing to use it. I finally gave it away. Im happy now.</li>
    <li> Great machine does the job well highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have shopped around for a good unit to shave/trim my beard with for years, repeatedly buying cheaper units made specifically for trimming facial hair. I hated them all. Often they would bog and even stop cutting and seize in my beard (ouch). All are under-powered and poorly constructed of inferior materials. I knew what I wanted in a trimmer and even looked at animal grooming clippers in an attempt to find something that would hold up in every respect. When I found the Outliners and Styliners I knew I was getting close. I bought the M3 based upon everything I could read, watch, and extrapolate and I have to say it is exactly what I was looking for, and better than I expected in several respects. The fit is better than I had expected, I like the heft of it a lot. It is very powerful and yet has minimal vibration all things considered and it vibrates at such a high frequency that it isn&#x27;t annoying. Looking at the blade I wondered if it would do a good job of cutting coarse hair and thought I might have to get the stainless blade that has a deeper and wider comb, but my doubts were unfounded. It doesn&#x27;t get hot in the time I use it either. I suspect that oiling religiously and maintaining a sharp cutter will keep it working like new for a great many years to come.</li>
    <li> Best liners in the market...I have already all the other liners that they say are the best, but these ones are far better..I zero gapped too and are the best out in the market worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect one for professional barber whom specially working for military hair cuts and I recommended it. Price is high but it is worthy to be deserved.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever owned. Properly adjusted there is no trimmer on the market that can touch it.  I love the feel of the housing. It is not the same as the Styliner II, to me this is a much better trimmer. I had some issues with my initial purchase however Andis took care of it expeditiously. You will not be unhappy. The build quality of this trimmer is the best on the market..</li>
    <li> The clippers are a bit heavy. I had to get my barber to adjust the blades to cut closer. They became a but uncomfortable, but I guess sacrificing pain for a sharper lining is plausible. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great clipper, I cut my son hair myself.  Barber take too long and too much skipping you!</li>
    <li> I like the way this trimmer stays cool and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I would  recommend it. If you like precision this is the one.</li>
    <li> They were broken when I got them.</li>
    <li> I used these trimmers last night and was pleased with the results</li>
    <li> I have cut my own hair since I was a teenager and these are the best edgers I have used.</li>
    <li> Run cool, cut extremely close to the skin, it has an amazing power I highly recommend this trimmer and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Best liners I ever used</li>
    <li> Product arrived with a broken blade and the trimmer sounds horrible. The adjustment screw on the side of the trimmer is very hard and stiff making it difficult to adjust the cutting stroke.</li>
    <li> Awesome product........shaves and cuts clean!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Actually my second styliner M3......blew previous one when I went overseas.....have a backup if going abroad with it......but great for use here in the US.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer not as loud as its twin the styliner 2 but cuts equally as good this trimmer is great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also best trimmers hands down&lt;br /&gt;andis gtx&lt;br /&gt;andis styliner 2&lt;br /&gt;andis styliner m3</li>
    <li> All right I got it everything good</li>
    <li> Great trimmer,very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product...</li>
    <li> I  am really enjoying  the smooth clean cut  they give and they are not to heavy they are easy to handle and i think this was a good buy.</li>
    <li> The Andis Styliner M3 Trimmer is a very sharp trimmer if adjusted properly. I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for 17 years and they took me a while to adjust. I&#x27;ve been using these trimmers for one month now &amp; I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of these trimmers.  If you&#x27;re the type of person that wants to take a pair of trimmers out of the box &amp; go than these are not the trimmers for you.  I would go with the Styliner II trimmers.  They almost don&#x27;t  heat up (as the Styliner M3s do) and they&#x27;re much lighter in weight.  If I had to pick one trimmer it would be the Styliner II.  But since I collect trimmers &amp; clippers I went ahead &amp; bought the M3s any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, before buying any trimmer or clipper Youtube them first, as this will let you know what the product is like before you buy it.  Most people who buy Andis products &amp; leave bad reviews don&#x27;t know their machines full potential or how to use Andis products in general.  If you&#x27;re new to cutting hair I would go with Wahl products.  Wahl products are easy to use but still very reliable and will definitely get the job done.  Also, Wahl products last a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all the Andis Styliner M3s are very sharp, strong &amp; durable, and cut with ease.  Downside, they: are heavy, get hot, and are expensive.  Styliner II is a much better buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note, Andis products are mainly for barbers who specialize in tapering (fades), trimming (line ups), and designs.  If your a barber that doesn&#x27;t specialize in the above, Wahl or Oster would be the way to go.  If you cut hair at home for a few people here &amp; there, Wahl products will do.</li>
    <li> get clippers, i use them to line myself up and to shave my face..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a minor adjustment, they became very sharp</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber and these are by far the best liners I have ever used. I used to use the Andis styleliner II, but these are noticably more powerful and the metal case is much sturdier and has a better feel than the plastic.  Worked great right out of the box! Quite and sharp! This will be my go to liner from now on for my barbershop.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer that I have ever used. People have said that it is heavy, and vibrates a lot -- and they&#x27;re right. But, to me, the performance of this tool far outweighs those small inconveniences. I&#x27;ve been using it in the shop every day for about a month now, it has never failed to leave a crisp, clean line in any texture of hair -- yet is gentle enough for a child&#x27;s skin. If you want a workhorse of a trimmer that can be relied on day in and day out, shell out the few extra bucks for this one, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Solid body, virtually unbreakable. So right there that has rewarded me several times over. I&#x27;ve had these liners for years, wore out the cord and replaced it broke blades and replaced them. The body still stands, unlike the standard styliner II with the black plastic body which eventually breaks.  Due to dropping it from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviewers say these are a waste of money. All liners and clippers are a waste of money if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing.  Yes it&#x27;s tricky to line up the blade of these liners as is every other liner on the market.  Just softly tighten every screw (feather touch), before committing to your final blade setting so you can adjust them where they need to be then lock them. There are many blade alignment techniques out there, find one you can apply.&lt;br /&gt;These are my baby! I love them.  I look at them like a pair of andis masters, a lifetime tool.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s 2nd Stylized M3. I bought the first about 5 yrs ago. He uses it 3-4 times a week to trim his beared and it has done great. It can trim close to skin without pinching.&lt;br /&gt;Our son was in need of a trimmer so I bought this one and gave him the old.&lt;br /&gt; I am sure it will keep going for several more years.</li>
    <li> Professional grade trimmers!!! Use for at home grooming,as well. They must be well oiled and  sanitized, and they will last a long time.</li>
