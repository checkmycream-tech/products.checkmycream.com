<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old man with a tough beard and the arcitec 1090 cuts right through the thick whiskers.  Louis</li>
    <li> I have no complaints.  The ergonomics took some getting used to without a contour dedicated for your thumb.  The shave is very smooth and battery seems to lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best shaver I have ever owned and I have owned several including Remington, Braun and several Norelco models.  Closest shave, light weight, compact, good looking and best battery life.  I am still working with the original charge and have over 20 minutes left after almost one month of use.</li>
    <li> Negatives? Price, depending on your perspective. The trimmer is worse than useless. it is quite small and mounted at an odd place in relation to the cutting head making it especially awkward to use.     I copied and pasted the above from the previous reviewer and his statement could not me more accurate. I purchased mine for $200 and it is ridiculously over priced at that amount. I was sold based solely on appearance as this unit to me conveys that it  could cut a small tree off your face with the three heads but this also could not be further from the truth. From initial handling of the unit I became disappointed. The unit feels cheap, when you turn it on it sounds like it is going to break. It shaves OK if you shave everyday but if you wait a day? Forget it. This unit (to me) should of been priced at $79.95 and the review would of been not the best shaver in the world but then again, you get what you pay for. I bought this unit to replace my Panasonic ES809X (comes in three version 2,4,and 5) and I am now back to using the Panasonic (which is a 5yr old unit) more than the Norelco. I wanted to try something different. There are definitely better buys and don&#x27;t be fooled by the cool look. This unit is perfect for those of you who never shave and want a cool looking shaver displayed in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> Everything mainly is good. Just amazon ship this item one week after I ordered. I guess Amazon need to order it from philips? I will not buy from amazon again unless I have no other choice.</li>
    <li> About 6 months ago and after over 10 years of faithful service, my old Norelco was in need of a replacement.  So I, as you seem to be doing, decided to research the current state of electric razors and discover how many models were being rated by end users.  I read reviews of available models from both manufacturers and sellers.  Based mostly on reviews posted on seller&#x27;s websites, I finally settled on a Braun Series 7 Pulsonic.    I received and used the Braun for a little over 2 weeks before I wrote a short review of the razor on the seller&#x27;s website.  I basically said it had a few nice features (user friendly charging/cleaning system) and that my face was still becoming acclimated to the razor.    Fast forward 5 months.  I really tried to like the product but my face never became \\&quot;acclimated\\&quot; to the razor.  I have a mustache and goatee and using tweezers (out of necessity) had become part of my shaving ritual.  As much as I disliked the idea that the ~$200 I spent on the Braun was a bad investment, my frustration with the razor convinced me it was time for a change.    Why tell you the above?  This review is based on a real world comparison to a \\&quot;top-of-the-line\\&quot; Braun model.    Evidently my face likes the technology behind this razor as there was no \\&quot;acclimation\\&quot; period.  I received a great shave on its first use.  In comparison to the Braun, the razor is lightweight, relatively quiet, and negotiates the contours on my neck and face with ease.  Unlike the Braun, it is very easy to use shaving around my facial hair.  It performs equally well for my daily shave, an occasional refresher shave for an evening out, and for a Monday morning shave after giving my face a weekend off from shaving.  The \\&quot;time remaining\\&quot; feature is fairly accurate and the razor fully charges in about an hour.  I don&#x27;t use the sideburn trim feature so can&#x27;t speak to its usability.  The ability to use hot water to clean the heads is great as I never liked having to purchase cleaning fluids for either the Braun or my old Norelco.  Bottom line, I highly recommend the Norelco and anticipate also using this one for 10+ years.</li>
    <li> the battery not rechargeable,and lasted only six weeks</li>
    <li> Been using Norelco&#x27;s for about 25 years and have been using this one for about 2 years now. First this is the most expensive Norelco I&#x27;ve purchased. Second, it doesnot shave as close as my older model or previous models I&#x27;ve had. Third, cannot plug it in if I forget to charge it (luckily I still have my six year old model (8140xl) that does plugin) and Fourth, If I don&#x27;t rinse this shaver after every shave (which would be everyday) I would get shavings all over my robe,etc. on the next shave. Note: I am buying another Norelco but not the Arcitec or SensoTouch line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a little over a year. I have medium beard growth at age 35. I shave almost every day. This razor is light, holds a good charge and adjust well to the shape of my face. On the other hand, it does not provide an exceptionally close shave; it will not pick up wiskers after three days of growth (I end up using the trimmer on the problem hairs, then shaving over them.); and it is a little bit of a pain to clean/maintain. Overall, I am not overly impressed with the razor, but I can&#x27;t say that I have ever used one better either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco electric razors for over 20 years and found them to work better than Braun. Not crazy about this razor, you must clean it every 1 to 2 days versus the older style design can go well over a week. It does the great job I&#x27;m use to but it&#x27;s a pain to clean after everytime I shave. Also, I&#x27;m concerned the way the shaving heads open, they flip open individually from the center out and don&#x27;t know if they will go the 5 to 7 years my other Norelco shavers have lasted. BTW, the only reason why I replaced my previous Norelco razors is because the batteries would no longer hold a charge.</li>
    <li> I think this is my fourth Norelco shaver, having used each one for about ten years.    Good features:   Shaves much faster.   Water cleanup is really easy.   Trimmer is precise and easy to use for side burns.    Not as good features:   Case, while secure, does not hold accesories such as charger, brush and head cover. (This is the sole reason for downgrade from 5*)    I have used the arcitec for one month.  Battery life is good - over 3 weeks.  Shaves are close and comfortable.  The information display is fun, showing minutes left on battery, recharge indicater, and cleanup time indicater.  I can&#x27;t say that the arcitec is light years ahead of my last Norelco, but it is a signifcant improvement.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Philishave 8000 series razor. Boy, is this a cool looking razor, with the carbon-fiber panels, the neat countertop stand, and the spaceship-like \\&quot;power pod\\&quot; (which is too hard to get the razor in and out of). The shave is closer than my previous electric experience, and does not irritate my fairly sensitive skin. However, the razor definitely has trouble picking up long hairs and hairs that lie flat against the skin. I used to shave every other day and find myself having to hit areas multiple times if I do that now - but the flip side of that is that now I can shave daily and not suffer horrible skin irritation. I feel I chose the right razor, but can&#x27;t shake the feeling that it could be better.    A final note - it really does take 21 days, maybe longer, for your skin to adjust to the new razor, EVEN if you are ALREADY using a different electric razor. Wait it out before giving up.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 30 years at least. This was my 4th model of Norelco shaver. I have been using this shaver about 6 months. For the first time I am very disappointed in a Norelco product and I will purchase another brand soon.    The trimmer is nearly non-functional. With the old Norelco products, the trimmers worked very well and I would only occassionally have to pull out a special purpose mustache/beard trimmer to perform maintenance on my goatee. With this new 1090, I have to use a separate trimmer all the time. The location of the trimmer makes it very difficult to see where it is placed so I can&#x27;t use it safely to keep the goatee whisker length in check without risking overcutting it. And the trimemr blades barely protrude from the body of the shaver which makes it nearly impossible to get the trimmer on a lone stray whisker. Now I have to to travel with 2 shavers.    Every other usage requires the shaver to be rinsed out. When travelling I have to keep the shaver in a travel case. This forces me to regularly dry the shaver with the hotel blow-dryer before I use it because it isn&#x27;t yet dry from the previous day&#x27;s cleaning. Every day I am either cleaning it or drying it. A real pain.    I will admit that it is light, feels good in the hand, and shaves well if you use it every day. If you skip shaving for a few days it takes many passes before it shaves all the long whiskers. I typically need to use a trimmer to cut some strays down before finishing off.    This product is not effective for anyone with mustaches or beards or someone that skips a day or two on a regular basis. Given how expensive it is, you would be well advised to find a different product to purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used nothing but Norelco razors since switching to electric from blades nearly 20 years ago.  This razor looks impressive, but the shave is subpar.  With the original head that came with the razor, I noticed that it seemed a little dull compared to previous models.  I started having problems with in-grown hairs due to the shave being more of a tear than a cut on the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced the head twice, but both replacements seemed more dull than the original.  I&#x27;m not sure if the quality of manufacuring went down at the Company, but this razor definately looks better than it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just made the big leap to Braun by purchasing a 790CC.  I&#x27;m reading mostly great reviews on this razor.  It hasn&#x27;t arrived yet, but I&#x27;ll know soon enough whether or not it lives up to all the hype.</li>
    <li> I bought it, tried it, returned it. Not because it is a bad shaver, but because it performs just like many other shavers that I&#x27;ve owned over the years, just \\&quot;eh\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve tried about 5 different electric razors and always went back to blades and cream for a truly close shave that didn&#x27;t leave a burn. I fell for the hype around this one and being a gadget fanatic I had to try it. It shaved just ok, but definetely not worth the hefty pricetag.</li>
    <li> I have owned and used Norelco electric shavers for over 20 years and none have come close to the results of the arcitec. This shaver gives a comfortable and close shave in addition to the fast cleanup procedure of rinsing the head assembly after each shave. Its artistic design is a plus allowing light and easy handling during the shaving process. Well worth the price of owning a good shaver. I plan to give this shaver as  a Christmas gift to my father based on my experience.[[ASIN:B000PKKAGO Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> Somehow, calling the Norelco arcitec 1090  a \\&quot;Men&#x27;s Shaving System\\&quot; seems to be a little pretentious; so I&#x27;ll still call it a shaver... a very, very good shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the aritec with the idea that it just might be time to adjust my look and rid myself of the beard I&#x27;d sported for the past two and a half years (long story, dull, boring and not germane to a product review).  I played with it and the beard for a week or so and then got real with the scissors and trimmer one evening.  Wow!  This is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This represents my fourth (or fifth?) Norelco shaver over the past 40-odd years, so clearly I&#x27;m guilty of some serious brand loyalty.  But while my previous Norelco shavers each represented a modest improvement over each predecessor, the arcitec is so far advanced that I&#x27;m really amazed.  It&#x27;s cordless (uh.. duh...), but the first appealing little techno-googah in its arsenal is a display that tells you how many minutes worth of charge remain.  Nice touch!  Another informational readout tells you when to clean the stubble from the unit, nice for absent-minded souls like me that can get in a rush some mornings and are left wondering days later why the razor sounds a little \\&quot;off\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kind of a \\&quot;good design\\&quot; junkie.  I can&#x27;t innovate myself, but I&#x27;d like to think that I recognize when the designers really, really sat down and looked for ways to make their product better.  The arcitec delivers on that big time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaving head ensemble is absurdly easy.  The heads just flip up so that you can blow, brush or rinse them out.  Yes, I said rinse, as in the use of running water.  This isn&#x27;t the first razor that claims to be water friendly, however it is the first one to give me enough confidence to actually hold the shaving head under the tap.  The only criticism that I have is that the trimmer almost seems like something of an afterthought.  It&#x27;s fine for trimming sideburns, however when I had the beard it was a little clunky to use while trimming around the edges etc.  But with my newly clean-shaven approach, that&#x27;s a very minor complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end however, all of those lovely little features like numeric display of the remaining battery charge, maintenance and cleaning access, and other things would all fall by the wayside if the quality of the shave were substandard.  So I will simply state that the arcitec leaves me with a smoother face than any other shaving system I&#x27;ve ever used... electric shaver or razor blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ticks me off more than paying a premium price for a product that doesn&#x27;t deliver premium performance.  And the arcitec delivers in every way... design, usability, reliability and performance!d the edges etc.  But with my newly clean-shaven approach, that&#x27;s a very minor complaint.

    <li> My first impression of the razor was that it was overly packaged. In a day and age in which we&#x27;re becoming aware of environmental hazards, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a need for an outer box enclosing a couple layers of thick hard-to-open plastic wrapping. A strong pair of scissors cut through the lot, and eventually I got to the razor itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to see that it comes with a hard-shell case for travel. This is definitely a good thing to have, though I would have preferred it were only one piece that swivels open and shut, rather than two pieces that have to be separated to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions indicate that the charging pod should be unplugged when the razor is fully charged (which takes about an hour). While hardly the worst thing in the world, I don&#x27;t see why they couldn&#x27;t have designed it so that it could remain plugged it but turned off. In general, I prefer not to have plugs lying around exposed, especially in the bathroom, where I think most people would tend to keep it. It does have a very clear indicator, though, telling how much longer it needs to charge before reaching the full 65 minutes, and, after a couple weeks of usage, it still did not need to be recharged, so it definitely holds the charge well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is stylish and comfortable to hold, and it has a trimmer on the back, which is good for sideburns and the awkward just-under-the-nostrils area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave felt like it took ages, and, half-way through, I seriously considered giving up and getting out my old blade and shaving cream. I decided to stick with it, and, eventually, I figured out that you can&#x27;t just press it to your face, but press it rather firmly. With more pressure, it eventually got the job done. Subsequent shaves went much easier, and as I got used to using the shaver, the shave-time got less and less. It does a significantly better and faster job on only one day&#x27;s growth rather than two or three, so it&#x27;s much more ideal for everyday use than if you tend to go a few days between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is easy and fast. Just flip the three razor bits up and rinse with hot water. I&#x27;m a little suspicous about using water to clean it each day - I would tend to think it&#x27;ll rust - but time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving, my face sometimes feels less comfortable than had I used a regular blade and shaving cream, but usually it feels all right. This is the third electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and it has been the case with all three that the shave is not as close as even the worst blade I&#x27;ve used. There&#x27;s really no getting around it: you&#x27;ll always get a closer shave using a real blade. I&#x27;d say this is easily the best of the three electric razors I&#x27;ve used, though, and did a significantly better job on the chin, due to its swiveling head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find myself liking this shaver, particularly for the traveling and the cold winter months, when I don&#x27;t really want to deal with a wet shave in the morning.nd to go a few days between shaves.

    <li> This is a very expensive shaver, but it does look very cool.  I&#x27;ve never been an electric shaver user before, so unfortunately I don&#x27;t have much point of reference for comparison&#x27;s sake.  But I mentioned the price tag right off the bat because for me it is the most notable aspect of this product.  This unit seems to be solidly built and hopefully will remain usable for a few years, in which case the hefty price may be justifiable for those who&#x27;s annual shaving budget is higher than mine.  Again, I wish I could boast experience with other electric shavers - because I have to assume there are good ones out there with a lower cost - but I&#x27;ve always managed to make do with disposable razors (not very environmentally friendly I suppose).    This shaver fits very comfortably in my hand and (again) the design is very attractive.  It&#x27;s small and even when in the case it comes with, it&#x27;s easy to fit in with my other personal effects.  I find it to be rather noisy, a little more than I&#x27;d like to be honest, but maybe that&#x27;s par for the course with this kind of personal electronics.  I was impressed by the area covered by the head - shaving time, for me, averages only a couple minutes as a fair swath is cut by this little device.  Cleaning it really is as easy as described - it rinses off under water, which is convenient.    The overall results seem to match the claims Norelco makes - the shaving head moves with the curves of one&#x27;s face and neck.  I get a very acceptably close shave - but of course, I always have gotten that with cheapo disposable razors (again, not advisable for the environment).  I can&#x27;t recommend the average person dropping this kind of dough.</li>
    <li> I used to wonder what caused redness and skin irritation every time I shaved. When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream, then I changed my shaving blades, then I tried changing my aftershave, but nothing helped. Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I finally found the answer after I started using the new Philips Norelco drive-shave system. First, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so that I can get the job done.  Next, let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave. The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system&#x27;s blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave. A great gift idea.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried. This review comes from much experience with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs. The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don&#x27;t waste money on the Cleaner accessory. It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job. It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs. I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway. Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically: The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade. Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70&#x27;s, Jim Belushi said, \\&quot;Buy a triple bladed razor. For those that will believe anything\\&quot;. Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco&#x27;s do a nice job. Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good. Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion. You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it. The less pin-holes the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model. It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster. It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function: It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference. It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped. Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery: Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices. But, it states to not over-charge. Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work. The other units would shut off after charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner/Charger: Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge. The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals. I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can&#x27;t blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can&#x27;t be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns. Nicer on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return it, BUT, it was a gift, AND I like the look of it. I know, I know!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-29-07&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a Braun 9595 through J&amp;R on Amazon, and it has a 60 day trial return guarantee.  This is the first micro-screen razor I have used and it is better in all respects to the Norelco Arcitec except for the fancy styling.  It is fast and comfortable, and my face feels razor smooth.

    <li> My husband used this shaver for awhile, and it worked fine, but it didn&#x27;t convert him from a standard razor. He says that it&#x27;s more effort for less results. Unlike a regular razor, you have to charge it, clean it and use a trimmer for sideburn and mustache areas. Also you shave almost every day, because once your whiskers get even a little long this won&#x27;t still won&#x27;t shave them close. (He doesn&#x27;t work in an office, so maybe he&#x27;s just not the right customer.) On the other hand, the charge lasts at least three weeks, you get a travel case and everything is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System is long awaited upgrade from my old \\&quot;James Bond\\&quot; quadraflex system of several years ago. For the time they should have provided a better product than they did. The heads seem to be larger but the cutting surface is about the same as the old. It cuts as well but not better than the old system. It does make more noise so you might think you are using a chain saw at first. It is not a smooth as the Quadraflex system.     The egometrics leaves something to be desired as the handle is a bit small for my hand at least.  Rather than hold it with my hand, I find I use two or three fingers. The design is nice looking and nicely crafted and put together with quality parts.     Cleaning is one area where Norelco has progressed most. Twenty years ago you couldn&#x27;t get the razors clean without treating it very harshly and using solvents, scrubbers, high pressure air, etc. Today with this razor, you simply open the head covers and wash it out with hot water, and it comes clean. Surprise, Surprise. That was the best feature of the new shaving experience.    Overall, I felt a little cheated with the new razor, since for the price, it wasn&#x27;t worth the wait nor price as the shave was not that outstanding. It was merely OK, not great as I expected. Had I received it free as a number of Amazon Vines members did, I would not have been quite so critical.    Bill Keasling  Newport Beach, CA</li>
    <li> This Norelco shaving system is just that, a system!  That&#x27;s what one pays for because the closeness of the razor is not near what the hand held manual razor can do.  We have used this, face for hubby, legs for me, and bottom line is the shave is not as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are great perks here!  The multi-purpose display is excellent, indicates how much time you have left before recharging and the time is plenty!  The storage case and charging stand are neat features.  But for the quick shave, you need to use it too long, going over and over!  It sure looks good though!  ...Rizzo</li>
    <li> This product is WAY too noisy compared to every other Norelco shaver that I have had. Also, even two months after starting to use this item, I still am getting the occasional \\&quot;pinching\\&quot; effect EVERY time I shave. Something else that I&#x27;m not used to with a Norelco. Seriously considering going back to my older model and using this as my travel version. Wonderfully light, and beautiful to look at, but........</li>
    <li> I bought the 1090 to replace my Norelco bb9190xl as it&#x27;s heads seem to slide around. The 1090 works quite well except that the heads seem to flip a bit. The heads need to be a little tighter. Also it would benefit greatly if there was a small ridge/ledge at the curve above the switch for us to put our thumb against. This would improve the handling; especially for us with arthritus in our hands.  I do like seeing around the heads while shaving and the fact that the cutter assembly does not fall apart while cleaning. The heads have no resivor so I have to rinse the heads every time I use the razor and leave it open to dry. I wonder about using the razor with washed heads  without spraying with lube after each use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a quest for a new electric razor since Christmas. I went astray and tried a Panasonic Foil type, and I won&#x27;t make that mistake again. So now I knew it was Norelco or nothing. So which one? The top of the line 1090 was just too expensive for me to justify but then the price dropped and I got Amazon Prime all on the same day! Now it was doable and I&#x27;d get it the next day? Too much to take... I had to finally get it.     The new cleaning method alone is worth the price if you are a Norelco fan. It&#x27;s so quick, and no removable combs and cutters to mix-up in the sink.  Just flip &#x27;em open and shoot a little hot water in there or run the whole head in hot soapy water. Done. Waaaay better system than any other Norelco shaver. It charges in only an hour and stays charged for a lot of shaves. 65 minutes worth. That&#x27;s a lot of shaves.     Unfortunately the quality of the shave is not on par with other high-end Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past. It takes longer and you have to go over your face several times to get the same results and I used to get with my Norelco Spectra.     Lastly, let&#x27;s talk about something that really doesn&#x27;t matter. The looks. This thing is gorgeous. The pictures on this website don&#x27;t do it justice. For one thing the materials it&#x27;s made from are all top of the line. Carbon Fiber panels, and super rich \\&quot;Black Chrome\\&quot; accents on the front.  Surround all that with a brushed stainless steel bezel and it&#x27;s about the best looking shaver ever made. It&#x27;s even got that nice \\&quot;rubberized\\&quot; back so it won&#x27;t get scratched up in the drawer. Of course this thing is so good looking you might just be tempted to leave it out as an \\&quot;art object\\&quot; for all to see.  It&#x27;s a great looking razor that does an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; job of shaving. I&#x27;m about half way happy with it... About half way unhappy...     UPDATE: Well it&#x27;s been about a month with the new shaver and as much as I like how it looks, I have to send it back to Amazon. My SpeedXL shaves much faster and closer thanthis new bad boy Arcitec. I really wanted to love this razor, but in the end, I buy a razor to use, not to look at.      I don&#x27;t know how people can say this thing shaves better than the old ones. It absolutely does not. It sure looks damn good though...  Maybe Norelco can improve the heads on a future model and I&#x27;ll give it another shot in a year or so.... For now? Stick with your old Norelcos. They do a better and faster job.</li>
    <li> Great shaver...and really cool looking!!!!!!!!!  Gave it to my husband as a Christmas present. He loves Norelco razors!</li>
    <li> I have a skin very sensible and bought that norelco believing that it would resolve my problems and give me good shaving. I was disapointed, the product has very good quality, but the results aren&#x27;t what i expected. I waste about 5 minutes for shaving but my skin was very bad after that with large irritated areas. The necessity of pass the shaver many times was terrible for my skin. I tried sometimes like recomended by the manual, but notice no change nor improvement. I think that it would be a great shaver for those that don&#x27;t have sensible skin, not my case. Besides that i don&#x27;t think that the flexible heads helps a lot, in fact i get the impression that fixed head it would be better for closer shaving. The display indicating time remaining is great.  It can be a great product for those who already use eletric shavers succesfully, but i don&#x27;t think that should be your first norelco if you&#x27;re thinking trying eletric shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Amazon.com for purchases other than books and software.  So after carefully examining the various razors and reading previous purchasers critiques  I decided to go all out and buy the \\&quot;TOP\\&quot; of the range product the Philips Norelco arcItec 1090XD Men&#x27;s Shaving System.    This was not a snap decision as I also physically examined the model in Booths chemist.  And after admiring the self cleaning aspects of the so called \\&quot;SYSTEM\\&quot; I gave myself a little treat and placed the order. This order also included an extra carton of cleaning lotion and a spare set of cutters.   I duly received the product but low and behold no cleaning \\&quot;POD\\&quot;.  How can this razor be accurately described as a shaving system. Surly a top of the range \\&quot;Shaving system\\&quot; includes the cleaning pod.    Enough of my woes but buyers beware. Once bitten twice shy.    On the razor itself I cannot say enough to express by satisfaction with this product.   I have over the pass 40 years always used an \\&quot;electric\\&quot; razor. Including 2 Braun and more recently 3 Philips or Norelco models.      The razor is a joy to use. It gives a lovely and almost silent cut. It looks and feels fantastic.  The humble \\&quot;electric\\&quot; razor has certainly come along way and progressed to the development of this model. The design is so well balanced between the cutting heads and the main body it&#x27;s as if the cutters were attached to the top of your thumb.  The charging system does exactly what it say on the box and is fully charged in 60mins. It does remind you to empty and clean the cutter head after every use. But this is a relatively straight forward exercise and not as off putting as other commentators have suggested. The recharging stand complements the razor in both design and usefulness. It has suction pads on the bottom to ensure that the stand and razor won&#x27;t move from its correct place.  OK the trimmer is not as big as on my current model. But it does exactly what I need in tidying sideburns and trimmingover ears etc.   Look it&#x27;s a Razor not a hair grooming machine.      Would I recommend the razor?  Most definitely YES, it&#x27;s a man&#x27;s razor. And thankfully as previous ladies have comment on its does not suit their needs.  So hopefully I will not see my wife borrowing it either.      However be careful where you buy the product and don&#x27;t get stung like me.       [[ASIN:B0014N0MFK Philips Norelco arcitec 1090XD Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> The shaver is very convenient to clean.  Battery lasts longer than I expected--4 weeks of daily shaving.</li>
    <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t satisfy as far as shaving around the sideaburns, ears, and nose areas.  Yes, it may be fine in the neck area, however that is a small part of a normal shave for me.  I prefer the other style.</li>
    <li> The new norelco razor is amazing !! I&#x27;ve used many electric razors and this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco for over 30 years and found the Arcitec to be: (1.) Noisier (2.) Does not offer enough weight and support for that comfortable massage of the face while shaving. (3.) Easier to clean but you have to clean more often. (4.) Shave quality the same as the older design and trimming function has always been just adequate which means you should use a razor afterwards in certain areas. (5.) Charging stand does not offer any additional benefit and miss being able to put a cord directly into the razor. (6.) I worry about long term repair costs and reliability vs. the older style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelcos for many years now, and I JUST buzzed my chubby little face with this new weird razor.  It is weird (certainly a very different design from other Norelcos).    I&#x27;m replacing the James Bond Spectra, which served me well for years.  I noticed a couple of things about this new fangled thing.  First, it seems to cut the whiskers on the first or second pass...as opposed to 5 or 6 or more passes.  Especially on the lower neck.  Second, while I&#x27;m not convinced that the shave is any closer than my old razor, it&#x27;s definitely faster (hey, it&#x27;s the same techology, isn&#x27;t it?).  Third, it does seem to be a little \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; in that I&#x27;m not sure this razor is going to survive bouncing off the bathroom floor like my other ones, but the design and grip is far superior to any previous Norelco I&#x27;ve owned, so I shouldn&#x27;t be dropping it.    It&#x27;s kind of weird...just like it looks...but I think I like it.  If you&#x27;ve used Norelco before, you won&#x27;t be disatisfied.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the close shave he gets with the shaver, loves how easy it is to clean, and loves the sleek, cool appearance of it.  He gets no irritation from it.  It&#x27;s a winner![[ASIN:B000PKKAGO Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> Always loved NORELCO, but this time \\&quot;ALL FALL DOWN\\&quot; very rough on throat area ,doesn&#x27;t cut as close unless you go over&amp;over&amp;over. The price for this razor is much too HIGH!</li>
    <li> i was so looking forward to using this machine but when i got it ,it broke me out and the shave was not clean .i had to use it a few times to get it clean............</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 men&#x27;s shaver and I find that the shaver does a good job and it has many nice features. But the trimmer is much to be desired, the head for the shaver blades gets in the way of the trimmer head because the trimmer does not come out far enough so you have a hard time maneuvering the trimmer around and seeing what you are doing.    I purchased the shaver from Amazon.com and I thought the price was good compared to other providers.    Thank you,  Fred</li>
    <li> i have philips norelco arcitec for about 2-3yrs I recenty face problem which I can not it is with the battery or with the charger(typ8500x,input100-240vac,50/60hz,9w,output 15vdc,360 ma)battery sign was turned red even with input connected to acpower supply.with the help of local dealer using same typ of charger the battery turned to blue colour for some time. put it on battery sign turned to red colour with speed slowing down. pleas advice.</li>
    <li> Being a Norelco user for the past 20 years, I expected more from this one.  The trimmer is absolutely horrible -- the lack of an extension (as in previous models) makes it incredibly difficult to use.  The rest is decent, but the high price means more thought from the designers should have gone into this one.</li>
    <li> I have always used Norelco electric razors and have been pleased with their service and comfort. When my last &#x27;Norelco Rototract&#x27; finally wore out, I ordered a Norelco Arcitect 1090 from Amazon.  After the first shave I was amazed by how close and comfortable it was.  The charging tower, carrying case and ease of cleaning by a rinse with water is great. I would give this product a five star rating!!  Good Job Norelco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco Model #l5810XL \\&quot;old\\&quot; for quite a while. I decided to find a newer product for a closer shave and easier cleaning. The 1090 \\&quot;new\\&quot; seemed to fit the application, so I purchased it. After using it I have found that it doesn&#x27;t shave any closer than the old Norelco and believe it or not it is harder to handle. The plus side of the 1090 is that it is so easy to clean, just run the cutter heads under the faucet. I hope this review will help someone get a more accurate picture of this item and think hard before you you assume \\&quot;new\\&quot; is always better then \\&quot;old\\&quot;. it just isn&#x27;t always the case.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has used a regular razor for years but wanted to try electric. It took a few shaves for his skin to get adjusted to the electric shave but he is very happy with it and I am too. It gives a close shave and he will also shave more often than with a regular razor.</li>
    <li> I too was expecting a first class shave with this new model. Instead it seems to skim over my beard growth cutting only a small irregular swath. I&#x27;ve used Norelco rotary electrics for over 35 years and instead of this model being the best it is one of the worst.    Specifically, my gripes center around shaving performance. Longer hairs escape the slots in the heads, and the longer the hairs become the harder it is for this razor to cut them. I wear glasses these days and am not used to having to wear them to shave. Also, some of my beard hairs have lost their oroginal coloring. Imagine the surprise when I put on my glasses and see those few random quarter inch plus long white hairs I&#x27;ve been sporting for the last week or so. Impressive.    The side burn trimmer is practically useless. It is both too narrow and does not extend out far enough. Cutting performance is unacceptable. Both these deficiencies are probably the result of a designers effort at making the \\&quot;package\\&quot; attractive, but done at the expense of function.    Save your money and pay half as much for one of Norelco&#x27;s more traditional models.</li>
    <li> This product died on me after 6 months. What else can you say? My last razor lasted 3 years and I wanted an updated one. Poor choice.</li>
    <li> This is a fancy shaver but does not give a close shave, even with a pre shave cream.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me one last Christmas.  Already the charger does not work anymore.  Never really used it all that much.  But now everytime I use it I watch 2-minutes more of life drain out out of it until one day it will be gone.    I simply would never buy another Norelco product.  And my wife now knows never to buy one again either.</li>
    <li> I found the blades too dull and didn&#x27;t cut close to the skin. I don&#x27;t look well-groomed at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for years now.  I recently purchased the Artitec 1090 as I was hoping to get the benefits of the new design.  What I found is there were no improvements with the shave and it was still hard getting a clean shave around the neck.  For the costs it definitely was not worth the upgrade as besides a slick new design the product offers no better shave then the cheaper Norelco&#x27;s.  The shaver was such a huge disappointment I finally switched to a nonelectric razor for the first time in my life.</li>
    <li> PHILIPS NORELCO    I HAVE USED YOUR PRODUCTS SINCE THE 50&#x27;S AND HAVE ALWAYS UPGRADED AS NEW MODELS WERE INTRODUCED.  I WAS ALWAYS TOTALLY SATISFIED -- UNTIL I BOUGHT THE ARCITEC 1090.    THIS MODEL IN MUCH INFERIOR TO YOUR 815XL - I HAVE GONE BACK TO IT AND DO NOT USE THE 1090.  IT GIVES A POOR QUALITY SHAVE AND TAKES TWICE THE SHAVING TIME.  IT HAS TO BE CLEANED AFTER EACH USE (OTHER MODELS GIVES 2-3 SHAVES AT LEAST BEFORE CLEANING.)  I&#x27;M VERY DISAPPOINTED AND HAVE VERY LITTLE RECOURSE AT THIS POINT.  NEED A NEW PAPERWEIGHT?  GOODBY, NORELCO.    [...]</li>
    <li> After 2 months of light use (by my adolescent son) the shaving head spontaneously fell apart.  The registration/warranty links on the Philips/Norelco were broken.  I was able to get ahold of support thru their chat.  Apparently, the heads are &#x27;not under warranty&#x27;; however, they are going to send me a one-time replacement. I hope to have better luck with the second.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth or fifth Norelco I have owned. This new one is not any better than the last one which is 4-5 years old. I don&#x27;t like having to clean it after each use and it is larger than the previous one. I was looking for something smaller, sharper, better than the previous one. And the price is much higher than other models.</li>
    <li> I had a Phillips Norelco shaver prior to this, but was intrigued with the three-heads on the Arcitec 1090.    I&#x27;t&#x27;s not inexpensive, but stubstantiates what they say about paying for what you get.    The shave is close and using it for an extended time (I have facial hair that growns several directions and is difficult to shave) does not leave my face burning.  It saves time because it is efficient in cutting even a \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; beard.    Even though I do have for an exptended period each time, I have only rechared it once since getting it.  It comes with a very durable and rigid pod for travel and that&#x27;s important to protect it from being damaged while in the luggage, or even having it turned on by accident.    Looks like I&#x27;ll be using this shave for some time to come!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple of different shaving systems from different makers over the years and they all had their plus and minuses so when it was time to get a new one I thought I&#x27;d get something considered \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; to make sure I got a machine that would satisfy my, very basic, needs. Unfortunately, as many other reviewers have concluded, the Philips Norelco RQ1090 is a design product where function was never a priority. I can use it fine as long as I have shaved the day before but if more time than that has passed the RQ1090 will pull hairs (ouch!) and I have to go over the same area several times before I get all the hairs. The way I now shave is to first use a very simple trimmer to go over the whole area once and then use the RQ1090 . . . That was not what I had in mind when I bought it. The only great thing about the product is the design which is what will attract most consumers (and it got me I guess). As a shaving system this product truly disappoints and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have had this for 2 years now and am rather disappointed. I&#x27;ve replaced the cutting heads once.    Pros:  Elegant design  Water cleaning is nice  Battery lasts forever. 84 minutes on a recharge. Lasts more than a month.  Very nice being able to see how many minutes of charge you have left.  Charging is very quick. Less than one hour.    Cons:  Feels underpowered. Probably isn&#x27;t but it feels that way.  Shave is average at best!  If I wait one or 2 days between shaves it will not cut the lighter hairs and I must use a trimer on an old shaver to cut them.  The trimmer is useless for anything more than trimming a single hair or an eyebrow hair.  The front plastic surface is deteriorating - looks like a layer of air or water creeping under a thin layer of plastic.  The price is excessive!</li>
    <li> Pros:   - shaves well because of the new design that allows it to conform better to both convex and concave forms  - charging cradle for easy charging  - Usage indicator in minutes left  - shaves faster then previous models (possibly because of the larger shaving area)  -shaves as close as a Gillette Mach 3 series razor  -cleaning indicator  -ability to clean shaving head with water      Cons:    - charging pod kind of bulky, does not store cord and/or cleaning brush  - cumbersome to clean out shaver heads; each shaving head has to be opened separately (better if there was a spring loaded release  - no easy way to rest shaver without use of cradle or pod (because of the shape of the shaver and the floating head configuration)  - use of the charging stand can diminish battery life (manual even suggests only charge when battery is almost completely drained; should have a button to initiate charge so you can still use cradle to hold razor, manual suggests only plugging in cradle/pod when shaver needs to be charged)       Conclusion:  This is a good shaver but Norelco has always produced good shavers, at least the ones I&#x27;ve owned.  The charging/travel pod is a good idea, but it is bulky and does not store the cord.  It would be even better if it had a flip out charging prongs.  The remaining charge indicator is a welcome benefit but that is only on the top of the line model.  Its also nice that it does do a quick charge so it can be ready in 15 minutes.  IMO, it&#x27;s a good shaver if you need to replace one, but I don&#x27;t see enough benefits to replace one that is already working well for me.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great, nice design, cool looking, but thats not why we buy a shaver.   The head is very flimsy, feels like its gonna break as you press it against your skin. You can press softly or roughly, no matter what you do, it gives a NOT-SO-CLOSE SHAVE. I had to shave ever day with this unit. It gives very bad irritation around the neck area, no matter how many times you use it. I have very sensitive skin. Around the mouth area, same thing, irritation. The shaver is nice, but for the price and what it can do, I would NOT RECOMEND THIS UNIT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco razors for 40 years and this razor was a complete disapointment...It&#x27;s noisey, has no trimmer that can be used, has to be charged in its holder which means you can&#x27;t use the cord directly and the performance of the shaver is questionable....all this for $200.  What happened?</li>
    <li> This is the best Norelco shaver I&#x27;ve had. I have been using Norelco for over 25 years, always buying the top model after every few years (and occasionally trying, and being dissapointed by other brands). The Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System really tops any other shaving experience. It just feels great on your hand, and the shaving is fast (probably twice as fast) and smooth (as smooth as a blade shave).    I bought the Arcitec 1090, with doubts on how well will it work. The reviews seem to be a mixed bag, with some users loving the shaver, and others unable to get a good shave. Some users were complaining that the heads did not move to accommodate to your face.     I have to say the shaver is just great. The heads not only accommodate your face, but have an even larger angle for doing so. The shaving area is also larger, and the whole set (includes a traveling case, and a &#x27;stay at home stand&#x27;) is amazing.     It is a bit pricey, but, if you think of how often you do shave, it is worth it.    Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> After a long research and checking almost any review I finally decided on the Arcitec 1090.  It will never give you a closer shave as you can get at a barber but is the best electric shave.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND, AFTER READING ABOUT THIS NEW RAZOR.  1ST VERY EXPENSIVE 2ND TAKES FOREVER TO SHAVE AND 3RD NOT A VERY CLOSE SHAVE.  NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric shaver most of my adult life and find the arcitec 1090 gives me the best shave and does it comfortably--especially around my neck and adam&#x27;s apple. I have used the Phillips Norelco system for a number of years--the arcitec is a great improvement.         Cadillac Gene</li>
    <li> Ordered and received it quickly.  It works as advertised and recipient is very pleased with the gift.</li>
    <li> I received as a gift for Christmas.  Have used Norelco exclusively for the last 20+ years.  This razor is a major major improvement over previous models.  The battery lasts longer, it&#x27;s quieter, shaves smoother, easier to clean, recharging system is better, carry case is better, lock out funtion to prevent it from turning on while travelling and the heads only need to be replaced annually.  Even the stand has added suction cups so you can&#x27;t accidently knock it over.  I love it!  The trimmer still is not that great but works OK if you are patient with it.</li>
    <li> Had a Braun.  Required special cleaning solution, got dull fast, caused in grown hairs.  Got this.  Closer shave.  East cleanup-just running water.</li>
    <li> iT IS A GREAT SHAVER BUT FOR SPECIAL NEEDS PEOPLE , THE SHAVER DOESNT DROP  FIRMLY IN TO THE CHARGER.so back to the old relyable corded shavers.</li>
    <li> After reading the mixed reviews of this razor, I decided to take a chance and purchase it.  I don&#x27;t regret the purchase one bit.    The positive things that have been written about this razor are true.  So are most of the negatives.  But I think the biggest problem most reviewers had are setting their expectations, so let me recap my experience.    I&#x27;ve shaved with blades, foil electrics, and rotaries all before.  I have sensitive skin, so as much as I like the close shave a blade gives, even the best moisterizer leaves razor burn.  Foils have never done anything for me.  So I always find myself with a rotary razor.  The last razor I *loved* was a Norelco, but after five years, the battery simply could not hold a charge.  I tried a Remington last year and was disappointed.  Better than a foil, but not my trusty Norelco.  So I bought this.    First, there *is* an acclimation period to this razor.  Even with my skin \\&quot;experienced\\&quot; to rotary razors, it took a month before I started getting *really* close shaves.  So people that write and only gave it two weeks and were disappointed...take it with a grain of salt.  The manual should say *at least* three weeks.  To acclimate faster, you should shave daily.  I know a lot of guys with thin or slow growing beards \\&quot;cheat\\&quot; and shave every other day, but it makes adjusting slower.  Every day.  For a month.  You&#x27;ll be happier.    Secondly, many reviewers comment about how this razor only works on stubble.  This is true, and yes, my older Norelco (and so I assume the Speed XL&#x27;s still) can tackle longer fur on your face.  But a weed whacker is not a lawn-mower.  The lawnmower you use on your yard is not the same quality as the lawnmower a golf course uses on its greens.  It is about precision.  This razor gives *the* closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten out of an electric.  INCLUDING my old Norelco.  This gets closer.  It is designed for the discerning male who wants a device that grooms with precision and closeness.  The trade-off is, to get that close, the lift-and-cut system simply can&#x27;t handle longer hairs.  If you shave daily (see above) then you&#x27;ll never notice this drawback.  But if you let your beard go a day or two at a time, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  But this razor isn&#x27;t for that man.  If a man is okay with letting some fuzz go for a day, he usually isn&#x27;t looking for that \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shave, and won&#x27;t notice the difference between the closeness of a less demanding razor and this one.  So this is a device for the elite.    The small trimmer is another criticism.  Again, the facts are true.  It is small.  It is not meant to chop down your entire face.  Philips makes beard groomers for that.  The trimmer, like every other feature of this device, is designed for the man who shaves daily.  It&#x27;s narrow blade makes grooming sideburns a breeze.  Wider clippers make sideburn sculpting far more clumsy.  You trim and sculpt, then take the razor to the skin and, since it doesn&#x27;t do longer hair, you get a perfect sideburn.  Again, a design for the man who demands the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; look.      So why four stars if I love this razor so much?  One word.  Price.  The numeric display is nice.  The metal finish looks better than the finish on the 1050 as well.  But neither of these justifies the $140 premium.  I paid it because I think it looks nicer that the 1050, and if I had to, I&#x27;d pay it again.  But it doesn&#x27;t mean I actually think it is *worth* the price.  I just spoil myself that much.  Call me shallow.  But the price, for the comparative lack of features does deserve a loss of a star.    --    In summary, if you want the closest shave from an electric ever then this is the razor for you.  But it asks for some discipline in return.  You have to put attention into yourself to get the most out of it.  If you are fond of facial hair, like growing a goatee or chops, you&#x27;ll want a groomer as well as this razor.    If you are less demanding about your shave then another Norelco device may be a better option.  The SpeedXL is essentially the newer revision of my old razor and I was perfectly satisfied with it for five years.  It was plenty close (but not as close as this) and very comfortable, so really you just have to decide how close you want the shave to be.  If you are a perfectionist, get this.  If not, save your money and get a Speed XL.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used a Braun foil shaver for many years, but grew tired of having to purchase their clean and renew refills every month.  Thought I&#x27;d give the Norelco a try.  My expectations were high for this shaver, given the numerous favorable reviews here and the amount of money I paid for it (even though Amazon&#x27;s price point is pretty darned competitive).  After using the Norelco for three months, I&#x27;ve ordered a new, top-of-the-line Braun shaver.  I shave every day - and shave my face and entire head (given that the hair on the very top of my head is long gone) and this shaver hasn&#x27;t lived up to expectations.  If there&#x27;s a few days growth (e.g., shaving on Sunday in preparation for work on Monday), the shaving process takes an inordinately long period of time, as areas have to be shaved over - and over - and over again before the closeness of the shave is anywhere near acceptable.  The shaver&#x27;s pop-up trimmer is a joke.  It barely protrudes when extended and is positioned in such a way so that the shaver&#x27;s three shaving heads obstruct your view of the trimmer (and what you&#x27;re attempting to trim).  It&#x27;s a sharp-looking shaver, but that&#x27;s about the only positive I can mention.</li>
    <li> Sooo easy to move and cut, great flexibility and closeness as advertised. After cleaning (holding head under running water with cutting heads open) the instruction is to shake water from the head before laying aside to air dry. Shake vigerously and the whole cutting head pops off bouncing on the bathroom floor - this is not a good thing. With the cutting heads open prior to shaking water out, I suggest putting your index finger firmily on the head to keep it in place. I love it!  Pete</li>
    <li> I used the latest Braun (Pulsonic 9595) for 3 months and have been a Braun fan for 10 years.  After using the Norelco arcitec 1090 for 2 months I can say it gives me a closer shave than the Braun, both in light touch-up and heavy-pressure use.  The Norelco is more fun to use and less expensive to clean.  Just run it in a small cup of alcohol every other week, and touchup with glycerin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of shavers over the years - mostly from the low end of the price spectrum.  This is my first venture into paying at the high end - and wondering what took me so long.  It&#x27;s shave is comfortable - no irritation whatsoever.  It shaves far closer than anything I&#x27;ve used before and the smoothness of my face lasts for several hours longer.  My wife comments on this almost daily.  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> The Arcitec 1090 is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. It glides easily over my face and gets into all the hard to reach areas that are a problem when using a blade. It is convenient and easy to use. Being a dry system the razor can be cleaned simply by lifting the shaving heads and blowing. (There is a very small soon-to-be-lost brush with 2 different size bristles included).  There&#x27;s no messy creams and soaps. It&#x27;s performance is so close to a blade that the differences would only be noticed in intimate situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes with a 21-day money back guarantee. The instruction booklet states that it takes a while for your face to become accustomed to the shaver. This is ridiculous, as if my whiskers were little sentient beings who at the site of the shaver are coerced to stand tall and meet their doom. If anything the shave is not as good after several weeks simply because using the shaver has become routine and I&#x27;m not as attentive in shaving as when the 1090 was new. The shaver does not peform as well on two days of beard growth. Any time saved by skipping a day&#x27;s shave is used up during the next shaving session. The instructions also suggest pulling the skin tight with one hand while holding the shaver in the other. This may sound like good advice but is not that easy for someone with an old wrinkled and craggy face like mine. But because it is so convenient, I&#x27;ll not be asking for my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with a stand that holds the shaver upright magnetically. It takes a bit of practice to learn how to remove the shaver with one hand. The battery charger can be plugged into this or the shaver&#x27;s plastic travel case, which Norelco calls the Power Pod. The shaver charges quickly and still operates for several minutes after the 65 minute display reaches zero. The shaver fits snuggly into the Power Pod and very little of the handle is left to grap ahold of when you want to remove it. There is a small trimmer built into the handle which is really too small to use effectivly.e handle which is really too small to use effectivly.</li>
    <li> excellent product package -- greatly improved cutting and comfort over previous models which already provided a great shave and value...</li>
    <li> Whoa, that is the nicest shave I have ever had with an electric. I have been using many Norelcos (and one Braun) for the past 18 years. This is by far the best shave of all. Shaved nice and smooth. Very impressed with how it handled the neck area. You can save money with the 1050, but I wanted the minutes display on the 1090.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. I was sceptic in a good shave using this kind of device. Nevertheless I decided to buy one. So analyzing some models and features I decide to buy the best one (I thought spending US$ 240 in a shaver).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Norelco didn&#x27;t work with me. My barb was awful. My neck was irritated. I spend more time that when I use the commom shaver (Gillete).&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend if you never tested in some electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ELECTRIC SHAVER DOESN&#x27;T WORK WITH ALL KIND OF BARB !!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous electric razors over the years.  I started with a 3-head rotary system similar to this, then switched to a foil cutting system, and back to a 3-head.  None ever seemed to give me the close shave that I expected...until now.  Right after I got this charged up, I gave it a go and was simply amazed.  The shave was close and smooth, and it didn&#x27;t feel like it was eating my face alive!  The ease of cleaning makes this razor a no-brainer too.  Simply open up the heads and rinse under hot water after shaving.  If you want it cleaner than that, you can then close the heads and submerge the cutting heads into soapy water or Norelco&#x27;s cleaning solution and turn it on for about 30 seconds.  The only drawback I could think of with this razor is that it cannot be used while it is plugged in.  I know after a few years, my old razor wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long, so I generally just used it plugged in.  We&#x27;ll see how this one does a few years down the road!</li>
    <li> This is the best shave I have ever had.  Does an excellent job on my neck with the absolute least irritation ever.  Love the rinse under the faucet feature.  The sideburn trimmer leaves a lot to be desired.  It is to small.</li>
    <li> I happened to have a pretty thick beard and they grow all different directions. I had an older version of Norelco and used it for quite some times and only changed the blades possibly once every two years and it still does a pretty good job. This shaver really is not worth the difference so in another words, you are not getting what you are paying for. It has a slik design and a very nice stand and that&#x27;s about it. I would recomment sticking to a less pricey ones as that all seem to be the same and even a little less noisey :-)</li>
    <li> The battery system on the Arcitec is confusing to long-time Philips users--- at least it was to me.  I&#x27;m used to keeping the shaver plugged in between shaves.  With the Arcitec, that practice almost kills the battery and there seems to be no way to revive it.  Very frustrating!  I must say that Philips customer service was excellent in resolving the problem (by sending a replacement), but I still can&#x27;t get used to the new requirements.  Does Philips really think I&#x27;m going to sit around for an hour while the shaver charges (a longer charge runs the batter down)?</li>
    <li> This is not worth the $$$$ price. Its a Ok razor like any other in the $100 range. The pivot design still does not do a good job under the chin &amp; adams apple. Moreover it does not shave deep enough, you start feeling rough in 3-4 hours which was quite annoying when you are in the sales or marketing...</li>
    <li> This has been the second time I purchased a Philips Norelco shaving System.  I didn&#x27;t learn my lesson the first time that philips Norelco simply thinks that they can sell TRASH for over $100.00  The first shaving system I bought I had to returned it because simply it did not do what they try to make us believe it would do.   The razor will not cut your stubble even after going over the same are for more that 10 times.   It feels so uncomfortable and it leaves patches all over my face.   Waste of time and money.     Shame of Philips for putting overpriced trash in the market.   Consumers, DO NOT throw your money away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor (norelco 1090) about a month ago and I am completly satisfied with it.   I used Norelco razors for years but change to the Brahn razor when they came out with the self cleaning razor. The only complaint I had with the Norelco I was using was cleaning it. I hated to clean it. The problem I had with the Brahn was my neck hairs, it did not do a good job with them.  The new 1090 does a great job on my neck and all my facial hair and it is a snap to clean.</li>
    <li> Shaves very close BUT I have had to replace the head each three months at about $30.00 a pop.  They offered a refund but it works so well when it works, I hate to give it up.  They need to work on a new head improvement.</li>
    <li> I have used essentially every electric shaver made at one time or other.  I have always come back to Norelco.  I have tried all the newest Norelcos and this one is by far the best.  It gives a blade close, extremely fast nonirritating shave and is very easy to use, seeming to fit the hand perfectly for getting to the difficult areas.  The design allows more pivot so that one can place the exact angle and amount of pressure needed to any area of the face and the hard to shave areas of the neck and jaw line.   It cleans very easily with the heads popping up to be cleaned under a stream of water.  No taking fixtures loose and pulling out cutters and combs.  AND the replacement head set is quite reasonably priced at just a few dollars more than other Norelco replacement cutters (see Walmart). Some have thought the trimmer too small or inappropriately placed and designed.  BUT, all one has to do is remove the shaving heads (they pull out and replace extremely easily with no injury to the razor and its function in any way) to render the razor the perfect trimmer for all facial hair to include nose and ear hair.  When finished, just pop the heads back in place. And it comes with a jewel case that will protect the razor in any circumstance.  I&#x27;ll be with this razor a long while.  Hard to imagine a better.</li>
    <li> Be wary of this razor. It&#x27;s a definite downgrade from previous Norelco razors in terms of function.    Pros:   - Looks cool   - Cleans easily   - Shaves stubble (and only stubble) close   - Can be returned to Norelco within 60 days for a full refund    Cons:   - Does not handle anything over stubble well for long. Has very shallow reservoirs for the hair to collect in and when you shave anything longer than stubble it gets gunked up and doesn&#x27;t perform as well.   - Will spray hair everywhere if you tilt it off your face while running.  This is a result of the shallow reservoirs. The hair seems to collect on top of the razor instead of inside it.   - Needs to be cleaned after each use. Hope you get all those stray hairs the first time!   - Head will shoot off and bounce around the room if you&#x27;re not careful when drying it.   - Only has 65 minutes of shave time (compared to 85-120 on old models). It took about 10-15 mins per shave so I got 6 shaves in at best.    - Trimmer does not extend. It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to see what you&#x27;re trimming.    If you want a razor to shave stubble close and look cool then this is for you. Otherwise be prepared to stick the razor in it&#x27;s coffin like carrying case and ship it back to Norelco.    Myself, I returned this and downgraded to the Norelco 9195XL (last year&#x27;s model basically). It has none of the cons of the arcitec and it&#x27;s 100 bucks cheaper new on ebay ... too bad amazon doesn&#x27;t seem to carry it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor since it arrived, approximately 2 weeks ago, and thinking long and hard about the score I&#x27;d give it.  I actually intended to give it 4/5, the reason being that, while it&#x27;s an excellent razor, the price point is rather high.  In the end, though, I&#x27;m so impressed that I really need to give it a full five stars in spite of the price, with the caveat that you may want to take a look at one of the less expensive, stripped-down models; this one is the flagship, but all the models should be similarly excellent (please bear in mind this is the only one I&#x27;ve used).    And excellent it is.  While my feelings have already been summed up in the opening paragraph, read on for similarly styled (but moderate) hyperbole.    I&#x27;ve never gotten such a good shave with an electric razor.  Norelco does recommend that you give the razor a full 21 days of your time exclusively (i.e. not shaving with anything else) before making a judgment.  I haven&#x27;t had the luxury of giving it a full 21 days, as I need to get my review in; however, I&#x27;ve already adjusted to it so well that I can&#x27;t imagine going back to my old razors.  It will only get better as I get more used to it, although I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied at this point and unsure if it could get any better.    Not only do I use it to shave my face (which is obviously what it was designed for, and it does a great job), I use it to shave my head.  It&#x27;s not going to give you as close a shave as a traditional razor, but it&#x27;s also not going to scrape against your skin like a traditional razor.  You&#x27;ll also save money on shaving cream (the only extra expense is buying a new razor \\&quot;head\\&quot; for it yearly, the price of which I am uninformed of).  It works \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.  This is nice for me, as it takes a lot of cream to shave both my face and my scalp, and it does, in fact, do a decent job on my head.  It&#x27;s a little stubbly, even right after shaving, but honestly the only thing that would do a better job would be a blade, and that&#x27;s a difficult way to shave (I was previously using a Headblade).  If it can shave a head, where my hair was very thick, I imagine it would be adequate for even the bushiest of beards, and, again, it&#x27;s designed for faces, not heads.    If you look at the features list, you&#x27;ll see that this model is full of bells and whistles.  Truthfully, they are mostly extras you could live without; the lower-end models would likely be just fine, so I strongly suggest examining them as a money-saving alternative.  The meter that shows you how many minutes of the charge are remaining is sort of handy, the icon that lights to remind you to clean it is somewhat useful, but to say they&#x27;re necessary would be a grave overstatement.  In fact, the \\&quot;wash me\\&quot; icon lights up after basically every use, so its necessity is particularly dubious.  (As a side note, it&#x27;s marvelously easy to clean.)    In the end, the product does receive my highest recommendation.  I think if you tried it out, you&#x27;d be pleased, and even if you had to send it back and didn&#x27;t like it after three weeks via their guarantee (it does take time for your skin to adjust), there would be little time/money wasted.  I would, however, encourage you to check out the lower-end models.  Ultimately, even the high price point wasn&#x27;t enough for me to downgrade to four stars.  I&#x27;m normally quite critical.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver now for about two weeks, trying out different lengths of my whiskers.  I found pros and cons for both short and long whiskers.    When my beard is short, as in daily shaving, I experienced an extremely close shave.  Maybe too close.  If you&#x27;re used to a blade, then this probably won&#x27;t bother you.  Me, I&#x27;m still getting used to the skin irritation.  On a positive note, the Arcitec does a great job of clearing my face of stubble.    It&#x27;s the opposite experience when my beard is a little longer.  Say, after a weekend of not shaving.  My whiskers tend to hug my face rather than growing straight out when they&#x27;re given a few days to grow.  It&#x27;s these cheek and neck huggers that the Arcitec has a real problem cutting.  I have to go over an area 5 or 6 times, and even then I&#x27;m left with 5 or 6 stubborn hairs that have to be plucked or cut with the trimmer.    Other than that annoying situation, the Arcitec is a well-built shaver, with awesome charging time.  It&#x27;s easy to handle and hold on to for 5 to 10 minutes.  It has a nice looking cradle, as well as a sturdy case for storage or travel.    To sum up, a very close shave... the closest I&#x27;ve experienced with an electric razor.  But problems arise if you have whiskers that hug your face after a few days&#x27; growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using the 1090 for about a month now and I must say that I love this razor.  In the past I have been a traditional disposable razor user.  Shaving was never something I enjoyed doing so I would try to shave only once or twice a week.  As you can guess it wasn&#x27;t hard to tell what day of the week it was by the length of my wiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with the Norelco I decided try shaving more often.  Actually I had know choice.  The Norelco is not strong enough to get through a week&#x27;s worth of growth easily; I tried.  After my initial failure I started shaving every other day with the razor and a funny thing happened, I actually like shaving.  Shaving went quickly and smoothly with no issues.  I have not had any skin irritation issues and once I figured out the best way to move and rotate the razor on my face I can get nearly as close of a shave as I did with a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning on this razor could not be easier.  Just flip the caps up, rinse under the tap and store with the caps open to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the charge life.  So far I have not had to charge the razor other than the initial charge.  I am going past the 21 day charge lifespan that Norelco advertises.  The one gripe I have is the glowing blue light that is emitted from the razor when it is charging. During the initial charge I let the razor charge overnight and we had to close the master batroom door because the razor gave off a pulsing blue light that was very distracting.  Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thouroughly satisfied with the razor and Norelco has made a convert out of me.  I would definitely reccomend this razor to anyone.  I realize the price is steep, but I believe it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> This shaver makes a bit more noise than I would like, but it does a beautiful job on hair that is already pretty close. If you have any indication of beard, you&#x27;ll have to crop it down with your clippers beforehand, but other than that this comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The razor looks great, gets a close shave, has a long battery life and is small enough to keep on bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> I find that this electric razor performs very well.  I had another Norelco for many years and was happy with it too.  I gave in to the Braun promotions and purchased on from Amazon about a year and a half ago.  I was very disappointed with the Braun razor performance, so here it sits, unused and gathering dust.  For something which costs over two hundred dollars and performs such a simple task, the product was way over sold.      Signed    Unhappy With Braun</li>
    <li> This has got to be the worst and highest priced razor Norelco ever made. After about two months, I gave up on it and purchased a new set of heads for my old Norelco which is faster, shaves closer,and conforms to my face better.   Its cute but cute don&#x27;t cut my beard and I hate to think of what a set of replacement heads will cost. Unfortunately I am outside of the 45 day return period but I think people have been ghaving trouble with that too...Save your money or buy one of the more conventional Norelco&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent shaver and does a reasonable job on fairly dense hair/beards. It is fast and will get the job done, and for men that have to shave more than once during the day, it&#x27;s great to just carry along in the car to do quick touch-ups, just charge it during the weekend then stick it in your car or briefcase for that quick second shave during the workday. The floating head is very comfortable, leaving no razor burn, and it definitely does the job faster than using manual razors. The ease in which the unit cleans is also nice. Simply rinse the head under water and let it dry in the charging stand. The Arcitec has a super long battery life along with a quick charge feature. When fully charged it doesn&#x27;t have to go back on the charger for almost three weeks. This makes the unit very portable if you so desire. On the downside, it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close though as a 2 or 3-head razor, and the trimmer is poorly designed and of little use. It&#x27;s pretty pricey too, and debatable that the performance really warrants the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco offers a no questions asked 40 day return policy on the razor, a good indication that they really stand behind this product.</li>
    <li> Another Norelco winner!!!! I picked up this latest beauty and was very pleased with the quality of the shave, particularly around hard to reach areas of the neck. The only negative was the trimmer, which, given the sleek design of this razor, is understandable. The only problem is that my son \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; mine permanently. While I was waiting for my replacement on back order, I purchased the new Braun Pulsamatic. The Norelco&#x27;s shave is much better without the need for the cleaner hardware the Braun requires. Go Norelco.</li>
    <li> this dose the job i love it the only issue is it can get my neck real good but besides that its an a+</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband, who had been eyeing it for months. He loves it! I loved the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> I tend to bounce back and forth between Braun and Norelco and I&#x27;ve owned several models of each brand.  As for this one, Norelco Arcitec 1090, I think it&#x27;s a bit awkward to hold against the face.  Norelco used to have a nice angled handle/body that made it very comfortable to use but not so with this one.  It also seems very light weight and is a bit louder than my old Norelco.  The shaving performance is very good but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any better than the older models.  I love the look of the charging stand but I found one fault with it.  There is no power switch to turn it off which means that you have to unplug the power cord after the charge is complete.  The owners manual says not to leave it plugged in 24/7 which kind of defeats the purpose of the charging stand IMO.  The stand is functional as a place to store the razor when charging is complete.  Replacing the $35 head (blades) is by far the easiest of any razor that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Cleaning the blades is also easy by rinsing under running HOT water.  I&#x27;ve had self cleaning Braun and Norelco&#x27;s and got tired of buying those cleaning cartridges every month which made the purchase decision on this razor easier to make.  The pop out mustache trimmer is way too small and very hard to deploy.  They could have left that out of the design and included a separate trimmer which would have been more useful.  All in all I like this razor but I must admit that I&#x27;m not as excited about the purchase as I have been in the past with older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After spending a few days with this shaver I decided to return it.  I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s performance justifies the price.  It&#x27;s awkward to use, noisy and it&#x27;s performance is no better than the outgoing models.  I have decided to save my money and buy replacements heads and cleaning solution for my old razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver at BB&amp;B over a year ago and stubbornly used it for all that time.  I finally gave up and started using an older motel Norelco again.  The older shaver is great.  The arcitec, other than its&#x27; design is the worst Norelco I&#x27;ve used in close to the fifty (yes 50) years I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric shavers.   It&#x27;s a slow shave.  Tricky spots like chin and moustache needed to  be gone over and over again to get a decent shave.   It doesn&#x27;t hold whiskers, but lets them fall all over the sink and floor.  It does look great, but as I said, that&#x27;s it.  If you want a Norelco buy one of the older models and steer clear of the arcitec.</li>
    <li> I have been a buyer of Norelco shavers for more than 10 years. I think Norelco the best products, not to say they are extraordinary, just that they are the best compared to what is available. The Arcitec 1090 is the  3rd top-of-the-line product I have purchased from Norelco, with the rationale that if I buy the best product there is, for my tough and fast-growing beard, I must be getting the best the market offers. But yet again I am disappointed to find out that, like the prior 2 replacements, the next generation of Norelco products are not necessarily better than the prior, just different and more expensive. I grow thick beard very quickly (with 24 hours). Like the predecessors (Quadra and XL series) the Arcitec does a good job around my cheeks and moustache area, but a poor good job around the neck. As prior models, I usually give up in mid-shave and end my finishing with a  Gilette razor for the neck area. Very disappointing. Not only w/ the Arcitec, but the same story has repeated w/ prior models, I sometimes pass the shaver over and over again over hairs left behind without success...I wish Norelco came up w/ products designed to tackle thick and abundant beard (I am Spanish, the same type of hair Italian and Middle Eastern men grow).</li>
    <li> Do not waste your $$$!  this unit is the cheapest &amp; lowest quality electric shaver available from a brand name!  Awe full exprience.</li>
    <li> The new shaver does deliver a better shave.  I don&#x27;t know if this is due to the improved conformability of the shaving heads or the new blades/screens.  Quite better in tough areas like the neck.  Also, less skin irritation on sensitive skin.    The shaver is a good bit louder, but the improved shave makes this easy to adjust to.    The trimmer is a step backwards.  It is smaller, seems to work less effectively, and is partially obstructed by the shaving head.    The travel case is ok, but rarely stays closed when I travel.</li>
    <li> Bought the razor about a month ago.  Been using it ever since at home and on travel.  Nice close shave.  None of the razor burn that Marc (who bought a 1060, not a 1090) complained about.    I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for many years, typically upgrading every 18months to 2 years.  Last fall, I decided to give the old wet shaver a shot and have been shaving with the top-of-the-line Gillette fusion system since then.  I decided to go back to electric razors this fall for many reasons (cost, liquids and flying, etc.).   The 1090 was the system I chose and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.    Initially it didn&#x27;t seem as close as the Fusion system (I am very picky about how close a shave I like) but after about a month I can move my hand back/forth, up/down without feeling any stubble.  My face is quite smooth  and as I said above, no razor burn.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this on behalf of my boyfriend who is the lucky user of this electric shaver. He still insists that razor a blade gives a closer shave and I agree, the skin is a lot smoother and clearer but this is great for the weekends when he wants to get rid of the stubble and not scratch my face off. This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I&#x27;ve seen him use it and it&#x27;s a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!    Overall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work. This makes a great holiday gift, a gadget that people wouldn&#x27;t run out and buy for themselves necessarily and fun to have as an option in the morning.     - Kasia S.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing on behalf of my family member who already used a Norelco before, although not from the Arcitec series. This shaver is best if you shave on a daily basis. It contours to your face and neck and gives an even shave all over. However, if you like to go 2-3 days between a shave it will have trouble giving you a close shave. Your trusty Mach III will be better equipped to handle that growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ergonomics of this shaver are wonderful, it is small and light and very easy to hold and maneuver around your face. It comes with it&#x27;s own tiny case and charges by induction in that case which also protects it for travel. However, this shaver does not do a significantly different job compared to the sub $100 shavers made by Norelco. It is easier to shave the more difficult portions like the neck with it as the heads \\&quot;flex and pivot\\&quot; to conform to your shape. But again, the difference is very minor compared to the older shavers. Overall the improvements on this new model are more for form and style and do not improve the final output enough to merit a huge jump in price compared to some older models.</li>
    <li> The Norelco Arcitec met all of my expectations: Good shave; hugs my face;  very good under the neck; very easy to clean by placing it under hot water. I bought it with a 20 percent discount at Bed Bath and Beyond. My only complaint is that the charger must be removed once the razor is fully charged, which can cause some inconvenience. Overall, I am very satisfied, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Okay folks - This is my second review ever written and the first one was for the Braun Pulsonic I just returned to the store! I have used the top of the line Norelco for the past 20 years, while replacing them on average every 2-3 years. I had been using the 9195XL for two years and recently had my original and replacement stolen within the period of 2 months from my luggage while traveling. It was time to finally try something new as I had never strayed from Norelco.    My brother loved the Braun Pulsonic, so I bought one. Yeah, it was cool, had the cleaner, etc... But at the end of the day, it was THE WORST SHAVE EVER!! I have sensitive skin and actually had to get the courage up to use that thing. Well, after 28 days, and continuous facial cuts, and redness, I returned it (not to mention all of the facial hair it left on my face!!!). I bought the Norelco Arcitec based on some reviews I read becuase I just couldn&#x27;t take the pain of shaving with that thing anymore!    Well, I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about 2.5 weeks now and never had a re-adjustment period. I got the closest shave EVER from an electric with this thing. Not only was it the closes, it was also the quickest and most painless shave I&#x27;ve ever had. While it&#x27;s hard to get excited about a razor, I LOVE this thing and actually like to shave every day again, knowing that it won&#x27;t hurt and will look good.    There are a few bits of criticism about this, which should NOT affect your buying decision.  1) it has to be cleaned every day as the &#x27;hair storage&#x27; is much smaller... Okay, small price to pay  2) The travel case is a bit flimsy to travel with. I was used to the solid metal case I had that stored the razor WITH the head cover on it. This one is a two piece case that opens a little easier  3) The Side Burn Trimmer - Not as wide as all previous norelcos, but definately the best/closest trimmer yet!!! I know this is nitpicky, but just my findings.    Good luck with your shaving endeavors... You&#x27;ll enjoythis unit!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to spend this much money on an electric razor, it had better deliver one heck of a good shave.  Every razor seems to promise a close shave of the hairs on your neck, and in my experience none of them deliver on that promise.  That&#x27;s one of the reasons I&#x27;ve always hated shaving.  This Arcitec 1090 comes (and cuts) closer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used, though.  The reason why it outshines the competition in this regard is, of course, the flexibility (in any direction) of its head.  Pivot technology, they call it.  Of course, you&#x27;d think someone would have come up with this idea long before the 21st century; it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a secret that there&#x27;s some curvature involved when you move from your face down to your neck.  In any case, this pivot technology, combined with the razor&#x27;s Triple Track shaving heads, definitely makes this the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  The Triple Track shaving heads really are a must in my opinion; I&#x27;ve used razors with the metal foil head in the past, and that metal foil always ends up tearing here or there, leaving you standing there one morning looking at a big scratch across your cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my favorite thing about this razor is its LED display, which shows you how many more minutes of shaving time you have left before the battery drains completely.  That&#x27;s another idea whose time has certainly come.  There&#x27;s nothing worse than having your shaver suddenly whir down to silence while you&#x27;re halfway through shaving - that should never happen to me now.  When fully charged, this razor gives you 65 minutes of battery time, which is pretty good.  I can go almost a month without having to recharge this thing.  When you do need to charge the battery, you actually have some options.  First off, you can either charge it in its charging stand, or you can use the \\&quot;luxury power pod\\&quot; that comes with it.  Either way, it only takes an hour to do a complete battery recharge.  If, however, you&#x27;re in a rush, and you&#x27;re in some kind of weird hotel room that doesn&#x27;t have an outlet in the bathroom, you can plug this razor up for just three minutes and get yourself three minutes of cordless time in front of the bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say that I like the feel of this razor.  It&#x27;s not as bulky as the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I&#x27;m able to hold it in comfortable ways I wouldn&#x27;t think of holding my old ones - and I think that helps me get a closer shave in less time.  You do need to clean this shaver fairly often, but all you have to do is pull up the three shaving heads and rinse the thing clean.  It only takes a few seconds to do it, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the heads ever clogging up.  I would also point out that this thing comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee as well as a full 2-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, you don&#x27;t really enjoy shaving and won&#x27;t bother to do it on days off.  I went about a week without shaving during a recent vacation, so I got to see how this razor would handle a young beard.  In the past, this was always a slow and painful process.  I was surprised just how much easier it went with this razor, though.  Not only did I get a close shave in record time, I got it without any real discomfort.  I already liked this razor, and that just really sealed the deal - and so it is that I can definitely say I am most impressed with the Philips Norelco Arcitec 1090XD.ome kind of weird hotel room that doesn&#x27;t have an outlet in the bathroom, you can plug this razor up for just three minutes and get yourself three minutes of cordless time in front of the bathroom mirror.

    <li> I&#x27;ve never had much luck with electric razors. They work, but it takes a lot of passes over my face and I keep on wondering if I am actually saving any time over using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case - no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a beard and I don&#x27;t have a lot of shaving needs - but I do need to trim my neck around the edges, especially on my neck. This shaver does on okay job, but this is a top of the line electric shaver and I expected more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it comes with a trimmer that is pretty nifty, it is extraordinarily easy to clean and is comfortable - both to the hand and to the face. The charger is easy to use and the unit tells you how many minutes and charge are left - a super-cool feature.</li>
    <li> i purchased this razor thinking it would shave better than my old norelco but i was disappointed. i got a better shave with my old norelco. i don&#x27;t like this razor.</li>
    <li> My husband says this is the best shaver he has ever used.  It is fast, light to handle and non abrasive.  He will never use another type of razer again. When this one wears out he will order another.  He says it is worth ever penny.</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco shavers for 30+years. This unit is by far the very best!. It is closer, more versatile, and sleeker than any product on the market, I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco rotary shavers for the last 20+ years. I&#x27;ve always found them to work well and be fairly comfortable. After a few years use, instead of replacing the heads and/or battery again, I pick up the latest top of the line Norelco that&#x27;s available. The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved. It just gives a mediocre, uncomfortable shave. I&#x27;ve since returned it, and ordered new heads for my older Norelco. I would seriously think twice before spending $200 on this product.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s cool looking but the performance of this razor is poor by any standard. It is very difficult to get a close cut. I find myself missing a lot of spots shaving and really have to stretch my skin and press hard to get a clean cut. I am back to a blade looking for a replacement. This never should have made it to market.</li>
    <li> I am 64 years old and have owned many electric shavers. This one is the best by far. It gives a great shave and the battery charge seems to last forever. The thing I like best about it is how easy it is to clean. You just flip open the three shaver heads, rinse away the whiskers under the tap, shake off the excess water and then leave the heads open in the shaver stand to dry. Easy. This shaver was pricey, but to me, worth the money.     Bruce  San Jose, CA</li>
    <li> I have owned different models of Norelco Electric razors for at least 20 years but this one is far superior to all previous models.  It gives the best shave I have ever experienced with any electric razor.</li>
    <li> Light weight and convenient to use.  Easy to clean.  The trimmer is small but it meets my needs. I have tried other electric razors but have always gone back to Norelco.  The arcitec 1090 is the best yet.</li>
    <li> Have had a few Norelco razors. This sounded great and aesthetic. Do not feel it works as well as my previous one. Great design, fair results</li>
    <li> As someone who&#x27;s never grown a beard or mustache (I can go maybe a day or two but after that it drives me crazy), this has to be the most comfortable electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  The three pivoting heads move over facial contours very easily, and I appreciate that it&#x27;s quieter than others I&#x27;ve used.  In spite of that, it took a week or so to feel like it was doing a good job - perhaps because my face needed time to adjust (as claimed in the manual) or because it takes me a while to figure out how to use it most effectively - but I&#x27;m happy with the job it does.  The neck has been the hardest area, and I&#x27;ve still got a few rough spots on the jawline, but it&#x27;s much less than at first.  The only real \\&quot;negative\\&quot; is the very small trimmer, which is placed rather awkwardly and doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice plus is the LED display showing exactly how much time is left before needing to be recharged, and each charge seems to last much longer than others I&#x27;ve used (betweeen 2 to 3 weeks, and it only took an hour to fully charge).  You can&#x27;t use it plugged in, but it will allow you to plug it in for a \\&quot;quick charge.\\&quot;  The display also shows when to clean it (about every other use) and the heads flip up for easy cleaning under running water (much easier than using the tiny brush).  It looks great, too - very sleek and cool and stylish - with a nice little charging stand, which looks good enough to leave out on the counter (minus the cord).  It also comes with a \\&quot;charging pod\\&quot; which will be good for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with it, although $240 is pretty steep.  It&#x27;s still not \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot; but I&#x27;ve given up believing that any electric shaver truly can be, but it&#x27;s a whole lot more convenient that using shaving cream.  (Others have complained about the \\&quot;excessive\\&quot; and difficult packaging, and I must agree completely on that point - use a knife carefully or scissors).</li>
    <li> I just got the Arcitec 1090 and on the first day I got a better shve than I got for almost two months of use of my Braun Pulsonic. While the cleaning system was great and the new shape also an improvement, the Pulsonic did not deliver on closeness of shave. The Arcitec gave me a better shave and was easy to clean with just some warm tap water. No extra expense and quick to do. The Arcitec is light weight and less noisy than the Pulsonic. I was very disappointed in the Braun and congratulate Norelco for getting the job done. This is a top notch product. I am a former Braun user and will never go back. Norelco gives you 60 days to try out their razor and Braun only 30 days. I had to eat the Baun since I assumed that the try out period was 60 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the contest between the electric razor giants, this one goes to the Norelco Arcitec hands down.</li>
    <li> Aside from a couple years in college I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor until I got this one.  After using the razor for three weeks to get used to it, it is still a bit of a let down.  It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn&#x27;t to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn&#x27;t cut.    There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it&#x27;s nothing a splash of water won&#x27;t cure.    But if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don&#x27;t have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.</li>
    <li> This is as close as I have gotten to an electric razor I can depend on to produce good results. I still need to touch up with a blade under my chin and neck but that is okay. A blade will always do better but this unit is great. I have owned it for about a year and have use almost every day with no issues.</li>
    <li> This new Norelco Arcitec 1090 razor has been my first experience with an electric razor, and overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s been a pretty good one.  Since I haven&#x27;t had any experience with other electric razors, I can&#x27;t really comment on how the Norelco stacks up.  However, I&#x27;ve shaved with a Mach 3 for many years and can definitely offer some info for blade/foam users who are thinking about going for the Arcitec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of this razor&#x27;s all-out positives: the charge lasts 65 minutes, which is a lot of shaving before you even have to plug the charger in again (the battery will have a longer life if you only charge it when it&#x27;s completely empty).  In addition to the stand-up charger, you also get a protective travel case with a jack for the cable that will act as another charger.  The blades couldn&#x27;t be much easier to clean--flip them open and rinse out, or stick the head in some hot water and turn it on, then leave them open to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versus a traditional razor, the Arcitec compares pretty well--at least as long as you&#x27;re only shaving one or two days&#x27; growth.  If that&#x27;s the case, the Arcitec will give you a VERY close shave (I haven&#x27;t had any razor burn, so this razor is probably more compatible to my face shape than it is to some other reviewers here), and once you&#x27;re used to using it, it&#x27;ll probably take less time than using a traditional razor.  Definitely be advised that (as the instructions mention) it can take your face about 3 weeks to get used to the razor, so don&#x27;t give up after one tough shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple slight negatives: if you&#x27;re going to try and shave more than a couple days&#x27; growth, it could be tough--because of the way the blades work, the hair has to find its way into holes in the blades, which doesn&#x27;t work as well if the hair isn&#x27;t sticking straight up (i.e. lying down on your face because it&#x27;s longer), so a shave with longer growth can be frustrating, missing entire hairs.  This can be remedied by pulling/stretching your face with your free hand (also recommended by the instructions) to give the razor a better surface to work on.  Also, the Arcitec, despite the fact that it has a trimmer (which actually works pretty well, better than some reviewers have claimed), can be a little difficult to get a clean shave up to the borders of, say, a sideburn, or mustache or goatee, since the blades are round and sit a centimeter away from the edge of the head.  Last, the more hair you have on your neck, the more difficult you may find shaving with the Arcitec, since the Adam&#x27;s apple is a pretty rough surface.ecommended by the instructions) to give the razor a better surface to work on.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for years, needed a new shaver, and was taken by the design of this new model.  After reading the reviews, I expected to get my usual \\&quot;Norelco shave\\&quot; - not as close as when I shave with a straight-blade razor, but the best of the electrics.  My skin is too sensitive to shave with a straight-blade razor every day.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the resulting shave was as close as I can get with a straight-blade - without the irritation.  The angle of the shaving surface is steeper than the regular model, requiring you to keep your hand and arm higher than might be used to, but I got over that in the first two weeks - and, was happy to change given the quality of the shave.  The only thing stopping me from giving this product five stars is the equally steep price.  Norelcos are never inexpensive, but this one really pushes the limit!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.  It performs wonderfully, and leaves his skin silky smooth.   Thanks, Norelco!</li>
    <li> The new design is a very big improvement from the traditional Nelcro. It is easy to clean and you can see better for close areas like the side burns and nose. It is not cheap but well worth the improvement in technology.</li>
    <li> I received the 1090 and it gives a very comfortable shave.     Having read the negative reviews before purchase, I cannot agree with any of them.     There is no excessive noise and it is quieter than my older model Norelco. It shaves smoothly and there is no razor burn.     I make one exception to my statement above. I also do not think it is worth $240, but then no razor is worth that kind of money.       Bill  Northern Ky</li>
    <li> This is a decent shaver to own whether it&#x27;s for a man or for a woman. It shaves great with no worries of cuts like with a conventional razor. I am a diabetic and risk infections easy which is why I use an electric shaver instead of razors. I have tried other brands and found the Arcitec to be one of the best I&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s price is comparable to the other brands. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> does exactly what what is says it does, gives the best shave around, better than a razor</li>
    <li> Fantanstic!  Close shave, without irritation.  This coming from a man who&#x27;s closed shaven with razors all his life. Great investment.</li>
    <li> the 1050- 1060- 1090 same razor shave  the same the only difference is the read out on how many shaves you have left.these razor shave very close.</li>
    <li> I too was lured by the innovative look of this razor and have been a Norelco shaver fan for 20+ years.  My problem with this razor is that it gives a lousy shave.  Misses lots of areas and will not pick them up even when I went over them time and time again.  I even went so far as to replace the head in hopes it was just a dud.  Not so...  Glad it works for some of you.  A wasted $200 for me.  I went back to my old one...</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco Arcitec 1090 is my first electric shaver ever and I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 months now. I had been pondering on whether to take Brown Pulsonic or Philips Norelco for quite a while, when ultimately it was probably the looks of the latter that prevailed so I ended up with it.    All in all it is a pretty good shaver, but not great. Perhaps I should start off with mentioning that I am NOT one of those with a thick and bushy beard, so I usually shave every other day. Normally I spend about 5 mins on shaving. At times my skin gets slightly irritated, which might result in light-red patches under my chin. Most of the time it&#x27;s fine though, and I can get a decent shave. However, not always is the shave that clean. Sometimes certain hairs (esp. on the side - around my jaw and around my whiskers, or under my chin) will be left out, so I&#x27;d have to trim them separately with the trimmer.    Oh yes, the infamous trimmer. It really is more of an aesthetic feature on the shaver than a tool serving its real purpose. It&#x27;s just too small and inconvenient. At times I&#x27;m having difficulties accessing parts of my face with it, unless I took off the shaving heads.    The shaver also comes with a neat LED display that shows how many minutes of shaving time there is remaining. Great. This was one of the features that won me over about this shaver. But what I resent is that it&#x27;s inaccurate. Well it does accurately show how many minutes you have shaved, but when it comes down to 0 mins, one would expect the battery is about to die, yet usually I can still squeeze several shaves out of it (which means additional 10-15 mins). In the instructions manual it says that after 3 charges it should display the remaining shaving time accurately, but I&#x27;ve already charged it at least 5 times now, and no difference. The highest shaving time is supposedly 65 mins. What is rather curious about all this is that on each charge I&#x27;ve actually been gaining additional minutes to the proposed 65 mins, so the numbers have gotten up to 81 mins on my most recent charge. I would be perfectly happy with getting those additional minutes if that means that the shaver will eventually display the time properly so that if 0 mins is remaining, then 0 it really is. (Perhaps once I&#x27;ve have charged it 10 or more times the display will finally get normal, as suggested in the manual? If it does, I might as well mention it here.)    Anyway, speaking of the battery, this is one of the features I am really content with. I can get numerous shaves out of one charge; therefore, there&#x27;s nothing but praise on this part.    I also like the fact that the shaver is easy to wash. You simply open the shaving heads and rinse it.    One thing that I as well dislike though, is the On/Off button&#x27;s silver paint peeling off already after only a couple of weeks&#x27; use. But alright, that&#x27;s already going into details now.      Pros:  - attractive looks  - long battery life  - light and not too loud  - easy to wash    Cons:  - trimmer  - doesn&#x27;t always shave ALL the hairs clean  - sort of inaccurate LED display  - paint peeling off of the On/Off button      If I could, I would give this shaver 3.5 stars. However, for a 4, I guess it will still at least have to get the LED display straight. So if after 10 or so charges it does, then I am giving it a 4. We shall see.</li>
    <li> I tried this for just one shave at Norelco&#x27;s demo booth, but it didn&#x27;t work for my face. I have a skinny, angular face with some concave (dips inward) surfaces around my throat. The three heads do a good job of hugging convex surfaces like cheeks, but it can&#x27;t get into the tight spots on my face. It also didn&#x27;t give me a close shave, leaving my neck and cheeks a bit scratchy. It also drew blood on my neck. I&#x27;ve used various Braun electrics for 20 years because the straight blade works better for me. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Intro:  My first electric was a Norelco. Once it died I switched to Braun and while the cleaning system seemed attractive at first I got tired of spending on the cleaning solution. I then got a cheap Remington which is pretty decent for the price (around $40 I think) and later got a Panasonic ES8097.  My favorite razor was the Panasonic. It offered a superb shave, cleaning was fast, easy, and cheap. The wet shave was pretty useless, though, and the battery was terrible. I have to recharge it once it indicates an 80% charge. This started a few months ago at 40% and keeps climbing each month. This is why I decided to get a new razor.    Arcitec 1090:  This is a good electric razor, but it has some notable drawbacks:  - Trimmer  - Only cordless use (although the battery is supposed to last long). For the price, I would have preferred the ability to keep on using the razor once the battery dies in a few years.  - Limited range of motion (as mentioned in other reviews). My older Norelco \\&quot;hugged\\&quot; my jawline and chin much better. Norelco boasts about \\&quot;optimum skin contact in curved areas\\&quot; but when shaving often there&#x27;s not enough contact in some areas. Contact is great on the cheeks and neck.  - No wet shaving. I prefer dry shaving, but the option would have been a pleasing addition for such an expensive razor.  - Price. It&#x27;s a nice razor, but not $240 nice.    On the positive side:  + Great shaves with very little initial irritation. After using it for a few days there was no irritation at all.  + Fast shaves  + Comfortable  + Low maintenance  + Easy to clean. No need to purchase additional cleaning supplies. One can use the small brush provided, rinse under hot water, and/or submerge the head in hot water with a bit of soap and turn the razor on.  + Nice display which is not ON all the time.  + Charging stand and pod. The pod is a bit larger than the razor itself, but I did not find it inconvenient when traveling.  + Fully charged in one hour  + Seems to be well constructed. Originally I had purchased a Remington F-720 designed by BMW. As soon as I took it out of its box I was disappointed. It felt like a cheap toy. I returned it and got the Norelco instead.    The 1050x, 1060x and 1090x have slightly different features but the razor itself is essentially the same. One can download the manual and compare them. I chose the 1090 since the price difference with the 1060 was minimal where I bought it, and I liked the idea of being able to see exactly how many minutes of battery I had left. I was lucky to find a place that had them on sale, and additionally I had received a coupon for a 30% discount in my purchases. I am very happy with this razor, but I would never pay $240 for it.    Conclusion:  Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the Arcitec 1090X. For the price, I think that Norelco could offer a better product. I&#x27;m glad I found a great deal on mine, otherwise I would have chosen a different razor probably similar to my Panasonic.</li>
    <li> * PRO: Very light weight, excellent pivoting and contouring, easy clean, closest shave yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* CON: Head assembly can pop off too easily, minutes display only on 1090&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used electric razors for many years, and I shave my head as well as my face with them.  Bottom line, this razor is the closest and quickest shave I have ever had with any electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the 1050 model with the charging and cleaning bay, but I would have liked to have the minute display on this model, like the 1090 has.  At first I did not like how the razor does not have a charge port on it, and you have to use the pod or bay to charge the razor.  However, after using it, I have seen that this is not a problem, and allows the razor to be waterproof.  Additionally, I would like to have seen a release for the shaving head assembly.  It can pop off a little too easily, but with care, this is not a major issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how light and compact the razor is, and like I said, it has given me the closest and quickest shaves I have had with any electric razor.  With other razors it could take 20 minutes to do my head and face, with this razor I am done in 5.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s review of the Philips Norelco Arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System:      Pros:     The looks. I know it&#x27;s not the most important thing when you&#x27;re buying an electric shaver but, come on, this looks like something James Bond would use.  Hard-case shell: Great for travel.  The design: It&#x27;s light and comfortable to hold.  Easy to clean: You blow or rinse, and both methods take no time at all.  No razor burn. This is fantastic.  Shaving: It does a very good job.    Con:    It does take quite a bit of time. Perhaps this is my fault, since I&#x27;m mostly a razor kind of man, but I have had to go over my face several times in order to feel clean shaven, and I&#x27;m not a particularly hairy guy.    Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it, but only for those who are willing (and able) to devote several minutes every morning to shave. For rush jobs, stick with the old-fashioned razor.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this shaver because of my past experience with electric razors. I want a very close shave and get it using shaving cream and Mach 3 blades (along with the cuts and chafing). In the past, I just couldn&#x27;t get it with electric razors.  With the first shave, I wasn&#x27;t real happy (not bad, but not great). My wife suggested reading the manual. There I discovered that I was using the shaver like I did a blade... pushing down hard against my skin.  The correct way is pulling the skin tight and going lightly over the skin.  This made all the difference. A really smooth shave was the result with no pain or chafing. Also the razor heads ran cooler (a little warm but not hot). I&#x27;m a convert... haven&#x27;t gone back to blades!    Philips/Norelco claims that a charge will get you about a weeks worth of shaves (65 minutes of runtime per charge).  That may be true for most people but I really want a close shave and take about 10 minutes to shave.  That gives me 6 shaves on a charge plus a few extra minutes for cleaning). The top of the line model actually has a display that tells you how many minutes of shaving time is left on the battery. At first I thought this was a gimmick but as you charge it the display counts up.  This allows you to charge the  razor just enough for a shave if you find your battery completely run down.    As for cleaning, these are 3 ways to do it. The slow (and least effective) way is to open the heads and use the included brush. The heads just pop open by squezing their sides. The 2nd way is to rinse the open heads off under hot running water with the razor running.  This is fast, very effective and my favorite method. A third method is to fill your sink with hot water and submerse just the heads with the razor running for a few minutes. With the last 2 methods, you need to leave the heads open so that the razor can dry.  Any way you do it, cleaning is quick and not a pain to do.    The shaver comes with a nice stand (that also can chargethe razor). It features suction cups on the bottom so that it wont slide if the vanity top gets wet (a nice touch).  It also comes with a hard plastic travel case (that doubles as a charger).  The included AC adapter plugs into either the case or the stand but not into the razor. Note that the razor runs off of the battery only (can not run off of the AC adapter). One complaint with the charger is that the manual says not to leave the charger plugged in (more of an inconvenience). This is offset by the fact that the battery fully charges in less than an hour.    Even though it&#x27;s not perfect, I really recommend this shaver. If something would happen to it, I would replace it right away.</li>
    <li> At first sight, this razor may cause some consternation to Transformers fans, who can&#x27;t be faulted for thinking that the arcitec 1090 is really the Decepticon known as \\&quot;Frenzy\\&quot; in disguise.  It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its shiny chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when it&#x27;s on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my (and my husband&#x27;s) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not much more than a pretty face, and isn&#x27;t for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;- There&#x27;s a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it&#x27;s time to see your Optician right away.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you&#x27;re pressed for time and out of charge.&lt;br /&gt;- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.&lt;br /&gt;- There&#x27;s a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men&#x27;s facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.&lt;br /&gt;- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You&#x27;ll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.&lt;br /&gt;- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn&#x27;t very big.&lt;br /&gt;- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don&#x27;t need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.&lt;br /&gt;- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll need instant gratification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007usband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.  - It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.   - The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads.

In addition, the area for catching hair isn&#x27;t very big.  - The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don&#x27;t need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.  - Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.      Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll need instant gratification.

    <li> I recently received the Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 razor and overall I have been very pleased. Before I got this razor, I used an older, less expensive Norelco razor, so I was excited to see if this one would be any better. I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the more expensive Norelcos, so I expected everything about it to be high quality. There are many nice features to this razor. The front of the razor has a digital display telling you how many minutes are left (out of about 65 minutes fully charged) until your battery goes out, which even works while the razor is charging so you know exactly how much the battery is charged. After you use the razor, there is a little indicator light that goes on that reminds you to clean out the razor heads. Also, the charging base that is included is very nice and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one of my favorite features is the traveling case that comes with the razor. This case is a hard plastic pod that fits securely around the razor. The pod even has a plug-in for the AC adapter so you can charge your razor while it is still in the case. For some reason the razor does not fit in the case with the plastic cover for the heads on, which seemed a bit strange to me, but not that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shaving goes, this razor works as well or better as any other electric razor I have used. I&#x27;ve read some reviews complaining about razor burns with this razor, but in my experience this has not been a problem. On my old Norelco, the three razor heads would bend in toward the center when pressured. This razor is just the opposite: the razor heads bend outward on the springy flexible neck part of the razor. As a result, this razor feels remarkably good when shaving hard to reach places such as my neck or under my jawbone near the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small complaint I have is that the side burn trimmer on the front of the razor is so small that it is difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this razor is kind of expensive, it works quite well, and so far I have been very pleased with it.r I have been very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Norelco Arcitec recently. l already own a cheaper Norelco several years old.  The arcitec is nice looking and appears very functional.  It looked great, came in a neat container that protects it when travelling and shaved quieter than my other Norelco.  What it did not do was give me a close shave!    At first I thought I was mistaken but after four more shaves I returned to my older model to get a closer shave.  I was very disappointed.  It was definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor, of the world, I tried several razor, and I decided to buy this one, thustly always in norelco, wowww this machine is the future, when I used it the first time it was awesome, I always had several problems cutting the hair around my neck, but this one in a flash momment cutted the hair around my neck, and I feel so good, Highly Recomended, The BESSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have owned several Norelco electric razors in the past and I have always thought that they provided a consistently close shave.  The new Arcitec 1090 gives an even better shave. The flexible heads easily fit the contours of your face and neck better than any previous Norelco model.  There are two minor drawbacks to this razor, well maybe three if you count the exhorbitant price.  The first is the trimmer is usless on this model. Even if the tiny trimmer worked, you could not see what you were trimming because the shaving head blocks your view.  The second irritant is that you have to clean the razor after each use.  Granted, it&#x27;s a minor annoyance, but if you don&#x27;t clean it each time you will end up with tiny hair pieces on your clothing and countertop because the collection recepticals are too small to hold more than one days beard growth.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice razor (quiet and smooth) but it does not seem to work on the neck like the comercials would have you believe. I often have to use a regular razor on my neck from time to time.    That said, I do shave my head and it does a great job up there.</li>
    <li> it shaves so so I guess, not great, not bad.  It is comfortable though and doesn&#x27;t irritate your neck.</li>
    <li> After using my Norelco Quadra for about 8 years and having absolutely no issues to with it I thought to myself, why don&#x27;t I try a new razor. Since Quadra never gave me the close shave, I thought I experiment and see how technology has evolved over the years. I purchased the best: The Arcitec. What a disaster it was. It gave me terrible irritation, cut the hair very slowly and refused to pick up some. My face would not adjust to it. I struggled with it for a month and returned it to Norelco who hopefully will refund my money. Since I no longer had my old Quadra Action, I decided to give Norelco another try and purchased the 8151XL. I only shaved with it once, however, it was the best shave in my life. It picked up all uneasy hairs without struggle and I never expected the closeness it gave me. I love it and actually look forward to my next shave. I strongly recommend purchasing any shaver from XL line up.</li>
    <li> This is actually my hubby writing this: -    Me and my wife did a lot of research before heading out to buy an electric shaver. I went with the intent of buying a braun series 7 since it scored better on review. When I saw the arcitec next to the Braun series 7, I was taken in by its sleek looks and style. The braun looked like a bludgeon next to this beauty!    I took one home so I could try it and return it if not upto expectations. No regrets! This baby ain&#x27;t going back to the store..The cutting action is flawless, and I love it. It is easy to clean and stow away (unlike the unwieldy cleaner that comes with the Braun). The neck area is a little difficult to shave, but with a little patience, you will get it.    Go for it. You will want your stubble to be 2 inches long everyday so you can use it!!</li>
    <li> I have tried electric shavers for nealy 40 years and never got a close shave-until my friend gave me the Norelco Arcitec 1090!!  This is the best by far and I have a tough beard but this cut through it like an ice cutter (ship) in the Arctic.  It&#x27;s woth the price.  Thanks Norelco!! Sincerely, HRWW</li>
    <li> I gave the shaver to my financee and he said that it is the BEST shaver that he has EVER had.</li>
    <li> Looked in stores right after Christmas and couldn&#x27;t find model 1090 no where. Everybody was selling the older models.. Ended up ordering it online at Amazon.com.. I&#x27;ve used this razor every day since I&#x27;ve got it.. Works great. Takes about 8 to 10 minutes to shave.. Shaves closer than I remember electric razors use to shave. Stays charged up for over 7 days. Easy to clean. I&#x27;d recomend it to a friend if they were in the market for a electric razor.. Only thing it&#x27;s a little pricey..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a month now. It didn&#x27;t take very long to get used to it. At first I thought it looked really weird, but it actually works quite well and follows the contours of my face better than my old shaver with a flat triple header. It works better if you haven&#x27;t shaved for two days. I guess the lift and cut technology needs a bit more length to work well. I like that you can wash the blades in the sink by putting a little water and soap and turning it on.    I don&#x27;t like the trimmer. While it works well, the shaver head is in the way due to where it is placed, so you can&#x27;t see what you are trimming half the time. You can pop off the entire shaver head, but you have to cover the hole with your finger to keep hair from getting inside it. I just use my old shaver for trimming.    I picked this over all the other models because it was the only one which had an On button that had a tactile click. I hate those capacitive discharge buttons. This one says, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll work for years.\\&quot;    It&#x27;s a solid shaver. Other than the day I got it, I still haven&#x27;t had to charge it. If they had put the trimmer on the butt end of the shaver with a cap or something, I would have given it 5 stars. That way, I could have just turned it around with the shave head completely out of the way. Would I buy it again? Absolutely. I like the smooth, fast shave, even though the trimmer leaves room for improvement.</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome. I&#x27;m in Iraq and sand is always an issue here. It gets into everything. This thing is so easy to clean and the carrying case that came with it protects it from all the dust and sand that is around. I&#x27;m in the military so having a clean shave daily is a must. This thing is exceptional. I haven&#x27;t had a face this smooth since before puberty kicked in. It&#x27;s a little more expensive that most others but it was worth every dime!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers all my life so I was hoping that this supposedly top of the line model would be better than previous models. I was SO VERY disappointed. The charge time on my previous model was well over 100 minutes. This one is 65 minutes fully charged. And the shave quality is very poor. I only have fine hair but even on my face, this shaver just doesn&#x27;t do a good job. I am so frustrated with this shaver - it cost a lot of money and the shave is bad.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone! And the travel case is junk. Nothing like the leather pouch I got with my previous shaver 6 years ago.    Don&#x27;t waste your money on this garbage!</li>
    <li> This razor is probably my 20th Norelco. It is the poorest of them all outside of being a handsome thing. It  will not give a close shave no matter how hard I press or what direction I move it. I don&#x27;t like cleaning it after every use. The side burn trimmer is nearly useless (too short and poorly located). I used my old Norelco for my last shave and it still shaves much closer. The side burn trimmer on the old one is great. I clean it only when it is full of whiskers and it has worked well for three years. I am glad I didn&#x27;t throw it away. I do like the charging system and the display on the 1090 but the cord should be coiled and stretchy. The cord is  difficult to store.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat disappointed in this product.     I have had to replace this shaver two times. There front has a clear sticker that can chip, wear, and peel within a few months use, (it&#x27;s best to remove the head when rinsing to help remedy this problem).     I have also had a difficult time finding replacement blades.     It sometimes leaves a stray hair or 2 on my neck and the edge of my mouth. No electric shaver compares to a traditional blade.    It&#x27;s best to remove the head of the shaver when using the trimmer.     I use the charging stand instead of the cofin when traveling as the pod is too bulky for practical use. The shaver requires either the stand or the pod to charge.     Looks cool, feels cool, not really cool! Definitely not worth the high cost of a sports car look with hybrid performance.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in June of 2008. I wanted to give it a good test before writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally wanted a Braun shaver with a cleaning station but never having owned an electric shaver wanted the option to return it if it did not perform well. Amazon - as described in the product detail - would not accept a return of the Braun with a cleaning station because of the alcohol contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Norelco instead because of the opportunity to return if it was no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a kid, I could not wait to have a beard - kept looking in the mirror for signs of life from my whiskers. My mother laughed at me and said that I would hate shaving some day. I hate shaving and I hate worse standing in front of a mirror every morning applying shaving cream, dragging that blade across my face and sometimes cutting myself. I had done this ritual every morning for 40 years - time for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Norelco, I can stand in front of the TV and shave while watching Fox News in the morning. No shaving cream, no water no blood. I can wander through the house and shave, I can go outside and shave. Ride in the car and shave? - sure, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no problems with the Norelco battery. When the display says zero minutes (I have always run it to zero before charging) I put it in the charger and in about an hour I am good for up to 85 minutes of shaving time - recently I&#x27;ve noticed that shaving time on the display has dropped to less than 85 minutes - maybe 76-78 minutes - after a full recharge. This is probably to be expected with the number of times I have recharged this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motor, switch, display and charger all going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving heads last me about a year. I did change out the standard head for an RQ12 head last year based on reviews at Amazon. The RQ12 head provides a better shave than the standard head and still provides a good shave after almost a year of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleanthe head periodically by partially filling a cup with 92% alcohol from Walmart and running the head in the alcohol for about a minute or two and then rinsing with hot water. Cleaning station? I don&#x27; need no stinkin&#x27; cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this has been a good purchase for me. When it finally dies maybe in about 5 more years, I&#x27;ll get another Norelco and carry on.</li>
    <li> New design and improved shave. Found only one problem with trimmer. Trimmer design to close to shaver head and does not stand out. Can not see clearly!</li>
    <li> At various times in my life I have rotated between using a razor vs a cordless shaver. While I prefer the closeness of a razor a cordless shaver does save time and money. The Arcitec 1090 is Norelco&#x27;s high-end cordless shaver that has oodles of features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Time display showing remaining battery life.&lt;br /&gt;- Ease of cleaning the heads after use&lt;br /&gt;- Suction cups on the base to hold the unit firm to counter-top&lt;br /&gt;- Nick-free shaving&lt;br /&gt;- The charging pod makes an ideal traveling case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needed Improvements and/or dislikes-&lt;br /&gt;- Not the closest shave - after shaving my face feels similar to what it is like 12 hours after using a razor&lt;br /&gt;- Not sure why there is such a large cost difference between the Arctitec 1090 and the 1050. The 1090 has a time display and the charging pod, but I have hard time seeing that as to justifying the cost difference.&lt;br /&gt;- Not sure if this product is actually an upgrade from the older \\&quot;Lift-and-Cut\\&quot; technology they previously advertised. My impression is that the new shave is about a wash with the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Summary- While I enjoy the ease and comfort of the Norelco Arcitec 1090 I am not sure if the added features make it worth the additional cost over the 1050 - and thus costing it one star. However, as a whole I have no problems giving the product a hearty endorsement!</li>
    <li> As far as visually impressive, you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find another shaver on the market to beat this. It&#x27;s beautiful, and feels great in your hand. The display is clear on it and it helps you know exactly how much of a charge you have left. I love this feature because the shaver I&#x27;ve used in the past only had a light that eventually went out when it needed a charge, and that&#x27;s not handy if it dies in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I see with it is the shave. While the heads do move independently just as they advertise, it still doesn&#x27;t feel like it catches every contour of your face. For this price you&#x27;d expect flawless performance, and while it&#x27;s very good, it&#x27;s not perfect. Still, if you&#x27;re going to give this as a gift or just want to use a razor that looks cooler than anything your friends have, you can&#x27;t beat this one.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. It does such a great job and it&#x27;s fun to use. The quality is amazing. I wondered how they could charge so much but now I see. Below are the comments I have on the unit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shave: The Shave is great. It&#x27;s close and does a great job on the neck. I can get under my nose easier with the small rounded shave heads. The heads do still \\&quot;float\\&quot;. They all move up and down to follow the contours of your face. I skipped shaving for 3 days and it still did a good job when I finally shaved. It took a bit longer but it made it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Style: It is so cool. I hold it almost like a pencil. I am then able pull my face tight with the other hand and get a great shave. It looks really good sitting on the counter in the stand. I keep the plastic head protector on it while it is in the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Quality: This model is really solid and well made. It has weight to it. The readout tells you the minutes left on the charge and reminds you to clean it. The long hair trimmer works well and is out of the way. The little stand has suction cups to keep it secure on the bathroom counter. You just plug the cord into the side of the stand and it charges through two contact points on the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Break in: I was already using an electric razor and it still took 4 days for me to get used to it. I got a slight rash and was a little sore. This isn&#x27;t exclusive to the arcitec. My last 2 razors did the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning: You have to brush out the heads after every shave. It only takes 15 seconds. Each head pops open individually. I pop all three open, grab the little brush they give you and brush it out into the sink. You can clean it with water too, but I haven&#x27;t tried that. I like it so much I don&#x27;t want to get it wet! I used to let the hair build up in my last shaver and only empty once in a while. I can see now this impacted the quality of shave I was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Comparison: Hands down the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. Best shave, nicest looking and the longest charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Accessories: The arcitec comes with a \\&quot;power pod\\&quot; which is a hard case that you can plug the cord in to charge the shaver. This will be great for traveling. It will keep it safe. You also get the cleaning brush, the counter stand, the head protector, and the power cord.gest charge.    - Accessories: The arcitec comes with a \\&quot;power pod\\&quot; which is a hard case that you can plug the cord in to charge the shaver.

    <li> A little disappointed with the flimsy, light weight  feeling of the shaver, more like what you would expect from a much less expensive  shaver, not a $279 shaver. This cheap construction  does not allow for a balanced handling of the unit, since most of us  are used to heavier electric razors. Gives you the sensation that it is all made from  plastic...but I must say that it does shave very well, which is precisely its raison d&#x27;etre.. So, its your call!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I was sick and tired of those pesky hairs on the neck.  Yes, it&#x27;s a good looking razor and the concept seems brilliant; however, I fell victim to the bogus claims made in the commercials.  Come to find out that my old $60 electric razor shaved much closer than this over-priced, gimmic of a shaver.  It is extremely delicate, and in my opinion, the super-flexible head actually prevents a closer shave.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Philips/ Norelco shavers for the past 12 years; and for the past 5 years, I have been using the 8894 model. for no good reason, I wanted a change and assumed that the new Philips Norelco 1090 would be more improved than the 8894.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;These are the highlights of the 1090 in comparison to the 8894&lt;br /&gt;1. Louder.&lt;br /&gt;2. less power; 65 minutes verses 100 minutes&lt;br /&gt;3. the shave is not better; practically the 8894 shaves closer.&lt;br /&gt;4. Plastic casing; 8894 had a leather travel case.&lt;br /&gt;5. Slightly lighter than the 8894.&lt;br /&gt;6. All the 10 series, rate the same&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line if you have been using the 8894 and want a change; my advice is stick to your old shaver and save the money. If you are buying a new shaver, go for the 7810 instead, as the 8894 is no longer in stock.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised after reading all the negative reviews.  This really did prove to be the smoothest shave I have had.  Washing was very easy.  My only complaint is not supposed to be leaving the device in the charger beyond the charge cycle.</li>
    <li> The Norelco arcitec 1090 produces a very close shave.  The flexible heads are easy on the face and conform nicely to it&#x27;s contours.  The design and material of the arcitec projects a well made shaver.  The only negative is the shaver is noiser than previously owned Norelco units.</li>
    <li> looks really cool but unfortunately very poor shape. keeps minimal amount of hair before it asks oyu to wash, which means that you will need to empty 2-3 times for one good shave! do not recommend unless you have very little facial hair and shave 1-2 times a day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a satisfied user of Norelco razors for years. But the arcitec is a major dissapointment in so many ways.  It takes much longer to get a clean shave than its traditional models and cleaning it is a chore unless you have nothing better to do with your time.  Furthermore, after using it for three months it continues to irritate my skin and burn for a minute or two after shaving.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, its an expensive gimmick.  Back to my reliable 8000 series</li>
    <li> Watch out for the bait and switch on replacement razors&lt;br /&gt;I have the 1280 and now Norelco have discontinued the original razors and now have a cheap low quality version, no doubt to drive you to upgrade, its a disgusting strategy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He loves it.  It&#x27;s the best Norelco out there.  Charging dock actually stays in place.  The shaver itself;  my husband only has to shave once a day because of how close it shaves to your face, he also doesn&#x27;t have to keep going over certain sections of his face like his neck.  So all in all it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> 77 yrs young, decided i needed a break from the blade (5) razor. previously tried several electric razors over the last 50 - 55 yrs. still not happy with the shaving results. old dog, new tricks kind of thing. am not giving up easily. plan to persevere for 3 to 6 months at the very least (after all $200 is $200). i have tried a daily routine but that is really rough on this old face. am down to every other day and that is somewhat better. thank GOD for retirement with no need to impress anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sixty-four and have been using Norelco shavers all of my adult life. When I needed a new one, my wife wanted to get it for my birthday. I specified a Norelco Arcitec, mostly because its looks made it look light and handy, and I anticipated that I would get my usual Norelco shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was I ever wrong. From day one, I had to check to be sure there were blades in this thing. It&#x27;s like a kid&#x27;s toy shaver--it buzzes and runs around over the stubble, but gets very little of it after several passes. I kid you not, I can go over the same spot 6-8 times and then test it with my finger tips and not notice any change. I generally shave during a one-hour commute. With the Arcitec, it takes me a half-hour to get the job done--and poorly. The Arcitec has a tiny capacity to hold shavings and when it fills up (half way through one shave) it shaves even worse. If I skip shaving for even one day, the Arcitec is essentially useless against my two-day stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a really OLD Norelco Speedshaver that I bought at an estate sale as a backup. This thing was old when I bought it twenty years ago. The previous owner used it to shave her legs. It&#x27;s a model number SC7830. It looks like a style from the 1940s or early 1950s. It doesn&#x27;t even have an on-off switch. I have no idea how old the blades are in this thing but it shaves circles around my Arcitec. I now use it instead of my Arcitec, which I threw away. (And my wife complains that I never throw away anything.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I just came back and read a couple of glowing reviews of this Norelco Arcitec shaver. One of them accused reviewers like me of being employed by the competition. Well, I&#x27;m not. Like I said, I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for 40+ years, and I most likely will again. After my experiences with this model, I think those who claim to love it must work for Norelco--or they have peach-fuzz for whiskers, maybe. I have to wonder if the Arcitec was designed by a Norelco employee who was about to quit and go to work for a Norelco competitor. This Norelco Arcitec was just a complete waste of money. I&#x27;m still using my backup Norelco Speedshaver from the 1940s or 1950s. It shaves. Maybe if you&#x27;re very young and still have peach-fuzz whiskers, the Arcitec would work for you, I wouldn&#x27;t know.petitor. This Norelco Arcitec was just a complete waste of money.

    <li> This razor is very effective at giving a clean, close shave on your face.     Cleaning the razor is a breeze, just rinse it out under a little hot water.     The charge lasts for about a month, with regular use, and the time indicator seems to be very accurate.     It&#x27;s light, gets into tight areas of the face with relative ease.    My only complaint with this razor, along with every other electric I have tried(which covers every brand) is the neck area. I was really hoping that I had found the answer to the neck going through the meat grinder issue. This razor is like any other electric, it&#x27;s murder on the neck. I HAVE to use Lectric Shave. I have no option, if I am going to use an electric. I have tried everything known to man and nothing works as well as Lectric Shave on my neck. I use it everyday. I do not skip a use, nor do I resort to trying a blade in between shaving with the electric. Before/after showering, morning/night, before/after breakfast. It makes no difference. So if you are looking at this razor as an answer to shaving the neck area with an electric you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Basic shave is OK.  However, this seems very tinny and over designed, especially given the premium price.  The trimmer simply doesn&#x27;t work well; the grip is awkward, and the trimmer very narrow.    Worse is the fact that the shiny metal cover on the front edge of the razor simply falls out if you put the razor in its travel case.    This is a case of marketing demanding shiny, but no one remembering to make it work and durable.</li>
    <li> I used to have Norelco 8894XL , which I have loved  for 8 years,  but now the battery is dying.     I bought this one based on Amazon reviews and I should have paid attention to them for the  good and the bad sides.     I will ignore the price benefit factor, there are cheaper models with the same look, so I guess if you want to budget you have options.       Good.   - Amazing design, you want to look at it and touch it!  - Much smoother shave then my Norelco 8894XL, amazingly better!   - I loved the packaging the stand and the travel pack is very handy, good idea to let it charge from the travel package itself.    Bad.   - BATTERY CHARGE practically HALF THE TIME OF THE OLD ONE (honestly I did not realize this!)  - cleaning is not self explanatory.  - Pretty much useless trimmer.  - Travel packaging is rather tricky to open.        Very nice shave, but not a  flawless product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my son for Christmas thinking that since it is the newest technology in Norelco razor systems, it would provide a pretty thorough shave.  And...at $200+, I don&#x27;t think I was being unfair to have high expectations.  However, after one week, my son called and apologetically told me that not only was this razor not giving him a close shave,he was having to go back to his old razor (the one he was trying to replace) to finish the job, especially around the neck area.  I did not personally use this razor, so I don&#x27;t know how fair this review will seem to the reader, but Amazon is graciously accepting our return and my son (after additional research) will purchase a different razor with the credit.</li>
    <li> This is a very good electric shaver.  I have extremely sensitive facial hair, especially on my neck; it gets irritated at the slightest provocation.  This shaver has been very good to me.  It is an expensive shaver, but a worthwhile investment if you shave a lot.  Even if you don&#x27;t shave a lot, you will be hard pressed to find a better electric shaver anyway.  I have enjoyed this product immensely.  It still takes me a little while to shave when I don&#x27;t do it every day, but this shaver has been better by far than any other shaver I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used several over the years.  I found mine on eBay about two years ago for $170 - see if you can get it cheaper than what it&#x27;s listed for here.</li>
    <li> This razor gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life and I&#x27;ve been shaving for 40+ years.  It just doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  I&#x27;ve shaved with the best blades I could buy, with Remington razors that honestly were a waste of money, although they were cheap, and Braun, a razor that I feel is totally overrated.  The arcitec shaves smooth, quick. and close.  Beyond that the fit and finish of the razor itself is second to none. Do yourself a favor, try it!</li>
    <li> I have shaved with electric razors all my life. When my old Remington shaver&#x27;s battery started to die I decided to change for a new razor. This was the coolest looking so I got it. Unfortunately it only works for that- looking cool in your sink. It gives you the absolutely worst shave have ever gotten with an electric razor. Read most of the 5 star review they only praise the looks.. My single blade electric shaver works better. Even with multiple passes it won&#x27;t give you a close shave. Useless. I changed the blades thinking that may be the issue but it works the same.   It has other design problems. For example you cannot charge the razor unless its on the stand or in its case. The case is VERY bulky to travel with.   I have never written a review on Amazon, but this product is so bad I had to do something!!</li>
    <li> THIS SHAVER IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD, I EVEN HAVE Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver AND IS LEAVES THE BEARED ON MY FACE IRRITATES MY SKIN MORE THAN ANYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;THIS SHAVER HAS AN AMAZING SHAVING ABILITY AND SUPERIOR QUALITY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Great razor but has one fault - it really doen&#x27;t shave that close, but then there arn&#x27;t any out there that do unless you use a blade.</li>
    <li> I have shaved exclusively with electric shavers my entire adult life.  A bit of a ritual, but I always buy the new top of the line Norelco as soon as it becomes available. I currently have the 9195XL and the James Bond Spectra shavers.  I pre-ordered this on Amazon and was anxious to get it as it clearly is a major departure from Norelco&#x27;s typical styling.  It arrived completely dead which I thought a bit odd, but charging it was the another first.  No cord plugs into the bottom, it has two small round electrical contacts the size of ball bearings, one on each side.  It charges in its stand or the travel case, a nice touch.  The new head arrangement pivots FAR more than any prior model and it really hugs the contours of your face and neck.  It is relatively quiet, shaves VERY fast and very close with no irritation.  It is also extremely easy to clean.  Each cutter/comb assembly hinges up, but remains attached to the head making it very easy to rinse out without worrying about the cutters and combs separating from one another.  Since the whole head assembly must be replaced to get new cutters, I suspect that part will command a premium. The protective head guard will not come off until you physically remove it, another Norelco first.    Negatives?  Price, depending on your perspective.  The trimmer is worse than useless.  it is quite small and mounted at an odd place in relation to the cutting head making it especially awkward to use.  I use a separate beard and mustache trimmer as I have never found an electric shaver to have a good one.    Bottom line:  this is Norelco&#x27;s best shaver to date...at least for my face.  It also comes with a 60 day money back guarantee, so you risk nothing by trying it....which you definitely should.</li>
    <li> This was kind of a last ditch effort to find a more comfortable shaving experience.  I&#x27;ve tried several electrics with the hope of finding a more comfortable shave since I have sensative skin and am prone to razor burn.  At the end of the day, I&#x27;ve found frequently replacing the Mach3 blades is the best I can do.  It gauls me to keep spending on money on something I have to toss, but it&#x27;s better than the alternatives to date.    The Norelco Architec 1090 looks great and shaves better on the neck than the foil shavers I&#x27;ve tried including the Panasonic Nano and Braun Activator.  However, it still misses a critical area in the middle cheek just along where a goatee would start to back about 1.5 inches from there.  The hair in that part of my face tends to lay down.  The Braun seemed to get that area OK, but did not do well in the neck area.    When I push harder to get those hard to get whiskers, I end up with road rash and sporadic ingrown whiskers.  This and other electric razors may work with people who have different types of beards or face shapes, but I&#x27;ve yet to find an electric that works for my whole beard.    In my opinion, a $250 razor ought to do the job quite comfortably.  I think there are better ways to use the funds, like on three years worth of blades and shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Pros: This shaver is quiet and extremely light. Also well very well designed aesthetically.  Cons: Very rough shave, irritates the face. While the shaver is very light, if you are traveling you still need to bring the bulky and heavy protection case which acts as the charging station.</li>
    <li> The Shave:&lt;br /&gt;The floating heads on the Norelco 1090 electric shaver really do a good job of conforming to the curves of my face. It takes me about five minutes to shave according to the built in timer on the handle. The shave is much more uniform than that of the Braun 3615 that I have been using for the past few years. However, the shave is not as close. Before the Braun, I used a Norelco 5801. This model is a big improvement over the old Norelco which was slow and not very close at all.. The trade-off with respect to the Braun is one of a closer shave using the Braun vs. a more uniform shave with the new Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance:&lt;br /&gt;The clippings are collected in pockets under the shaving heads, This is an advantage in that the clippings are not scattered over the bathroom sink as they are with some electric razors. The pockets have to be cleaned out every shave or two. This is not a big problem. It only takes a few seconds. The manual indicates that the RQ10 shaving head assembly must be replaced every year. Amazon offers the RQ10 for $35. By contrast the Braun cutter and foil assembly which lasts for about one year sells on Amazon for around $24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Environment:&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that you notice about the Norelco razor is the packaging. The outside layer is a cardboard box that is laminated with metal foil and plastic. There is no way that this can be recycled. Inside the laminated cardboard box is a PET clear plastic enclosure. This enclosure has an outside layer and an internal division. It is thinner than most of this type of packaging so you can cut it open. The PET plastic is type 1 and may be recycled. I think that Philips could come up with a packaging scheme that is more efficient. On the other hand, having a battery minutes-remaining indicator in the razor means that you do not have to keep it plugged in all the time, so that it may drain less electricity than other rechargeable appliances do.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to take up your time reiterating the 1090&#x27;s pros and cons which have been reported by the Amazonians who have reviewed it before me. Instead, I&#x27;d like to make a few points that haven&#x27;t been mentioned very often or at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco wants you to use this shaver for 3 weeks before you decide whether you like it or not. According to them, your skin and beard require that much time to adjust to the 1090. I urge you to follow their advice. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s entirely a matter of one&#x27;s face adapting to the new shaving implement or, rather, the hand learning the proper way to move and press and position it, or a combination of the two. But I can tell you that the first few times I used it, I was not impressed with either closeness or comfort. However, now that the 3 week try-out is over, I get a nice, close shave - the equivalent of that from the triple-blade disposable I had been using before. And with very little irritation - just a bit of numbness that disappears by the time I&#x27;ve showered (I don&#x27;t use aftershave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1090 costs a *lot* of money. I recommend that you investigate the 1050 as well. It will save you 70 or 80 bucks and the shaver is virtually the same. The business end is identical - you can tell this because they both take the same RQ10 replacement head. The primary difference is that with the 1050, you don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;Power Pod\\&quot;. This is a hard-shelled storage case with built in recharger - a useful accessory is you travel, but unnecessary if you don&#x27;t. The only other meaningful difference, as far as I can tell, is that the LCD of the 1050 shows remaining charge as a percent of maximum, rather than as minutes remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fully charged, the 1090 can deliver 65 minutes of shaving time. Norelco says that this represents 3 weeks of shaves, but you don&#x27;t have to be a math wizard to figure out that this means about 3 minutes per shave. I find that it takes me about 5 to 6 minutes per shave. That would translate to somewhere between 11 and 13 shaves. As long as I can go more than a week without needing to recharge, I think that&#x27;s sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last suggestion: if you&#x27;re going to lay out this kind of money for an electric shaver, you really *must* read the user manual that comes with it. It will take just a few minutes and you&#x27;ll be protecting your somewhat sizable investment by giving Norelco the opportunity to tell you the proper way to use and maintain it.nd 13 shaves.

    <li> The Philips Norelco Arcitec shaving system is designed to look good and feel good in your hand.  It also has handy packaging, coming with two handy storage/charge mounts: one designed to stand up in your bathroom and another secure case for travel.  Both mounts can be plugged in and charge the system.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about these mounts is they don&#x27;t have a space to carry the cleaning brush.  Still, I haven&#x27;t had to use the cleaning brush yet, since one of the best features of the Arcitec is that it can be cleaned in the tap: you just flip open the blade covers and run water over them.  It cleans nicely.  There is a very nice lcd display that shows how much battery time remains -- and the nice thing in terms of design is that you can&#x27;t see the display unless it&#x27;s on.  Otherwise it hides completely beneath the chrome like finish of the handle -- no ugly lcd display turned off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough about design: it looks great and feels great and has nice features.  What about function?  Does it shave well?  The answer to that is a bit more complicated.  The simple answer is: it gives a very smooth shave, IF you already have a fairly smooth shave.  If you shave at least once a day and preferably twice a day I find that it keeps the face smooth and polished, and feels very even across the skin and shaves quickly.  If you let it go for a day or two, however, and begin to show some stubble, the Arcitec doesn&#x27;t like that.  It can run over fairly short stubble over and over again before it finally trims it.  Even the (fairly modest) click out trimmer can&#x27;t cut significant stubble to a length that can be easily shaved by the Arcitec.  This is unfortunate for me, since I like to let it go a day or two between shaves.  I did, following the directions on the razor, give it about three weeks of solid shaving every day and that certainly did the trick keeping my skin feeling (almost) like a baby&#x27;s, but I found after a few weeks I wanted to skip a day, and then tried to shave with the Arcitec and needed to pull out my disposable razor to finish the job.  (I should mention that I once had a much cheaper razor -- you know, the $30 variety -- that I got for Christmas several years ago and it did seem to have greater tolerance for longer stubble.  With that I could get away with shaving every couple of days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum up: this razor is very well designed for the basic application of shaving at least once a day.  Very good for the distinguished gentleman, let&#x27;s say.  But for those a bit rough around the edges (or, as someone might put the point less charitably) for those who are too lazy to shave every day, it may not be the ideal choice.with the Arcitec and needed to pull out my disposable razor to finish the job.

    <li> This is, by far, the best Norelco Razor yet. The only downside is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as the prior versions of the Norelco shaver, but 65 minutes between charges is still gracious plenty.  It weighs a fraction of what my old Norleco razor weighs, and the way the heads are designed, it is FAR easier to shave your neck and face with it than the older version.  I would give it an A+ for sure.</li>
    <li> Better than any other electric razor.  Would recommend it for yourself or as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have used electic razors all my life and it&#x27;s not even close how close of shave I get with the aritec and its so worth the extra dollars. OMG, you rinse it out after each use and it&#x27;s ready to go for the next shave. I am very happy with this purchase and strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a top of line electic shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my third high end Philips/Norelco shaver in the past 10 years.  I bought this arcitec 1090 with high hopes that it would do an even better job than my previous 8894xl.      I&#x27;m sorry to say that after 3 months of using it almost every day... I consider this a step backwards from the 8894xl.  In their quest for a really cool design, and I have to admit it does look really good, they have lost sight of the fact that it actually results in a worse shave.    I find myself having to cover the same ground many more times than in the past and have to concentrate much more to check for missed hairs and spots that I have to go over even more.  Also, the statement that the new design improves the ability to shave your neck is not true, I think it is also worse in this regard.    My advice, dont bother with the cool Arcitec design, buy the top of the line traditional Philips/Norelco model instead.</li>
    <li> i have bought two of these shaving systems, one each for my husband and my son.  they both love them.  my husband says it is easy to clean, and my son says that his travels well.  they are a bit pricey but if you divide the price by the number of times you use it, it gets cheaper every day!</li>
    <li> After 75 years (Well I didn&#x27;t really shave during the first 15 years of my life) I decided to switch from a blade razor to an electric razor. Therefore I can&#x27;t really compare the Norelco to another electric razor. I did find that electric is much more convenient but doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as the blade razor.</li>
    <li> I have traditionally been a Braun shaver user, but have always wanted to own a rotary.  In the past I have tried several of them, but have not been sufficiently satisfied with the shave they gave.  When I recently decided to look at a new shaver I decided to look into the much touted Arcitec.  Unlike most people, I didn&#x27;t think the appearance of the shaver was particulary cool.  (In fact, I would say it&#x27;s just short of \\&quot;weird\\&quot; though the 1090X is better looking than the 1060X model generally seen in stores.)  However, looks are less important than performance and valued features, so when I saw a promotional code available on the Internet that allowed me to pick up the 1090 for the same price as the 1060 at my local Wal-Mart I jumped on it.  Here is the overview:    Shave and Handling:    The razor gives a good shave, especially if you give your beard/face the adjustment period (21 days) recommended.  The only drawback is that can take a little longer to get a really close shave than would be ideal.  (I believe it might actually shave a little closer/quicker if the heads were slightly LESS flexible.)  Just as advertised, I find that the razor is easy to hold and that the flexibility of the heads gives you the ablity to rotate the shaver from almost any angle and while still keeping contact with your beard.  Its new design allows me to cut around my goatee much better than any rotary I&#x27;ve ever tried before.    Indicator Lights/Warning Beeps:    I like the minutes of power left and low batery display features in particular.  I find this really comes in handy as exactly when to recharge a shaver can otherwise be a bit of a guessing game.    Precision Tube Trimmer:    Not good.  As many other posters have commented, the placement is awkward at best.  This must have been the only place Philips/Norelco could place it and still keep the felixibity and ergonomics they wanted, otherwise it is simply inexplicable.    Cleaning:    Fairly easy.  The heads are washable under water and there is a brush included if you want to do it the old fashioned way.  I believe you can also buy a cleaning unit and use Norelco&#x27;s cleaning fluid if you wish, but there is significant ongoing expense choosing that route.    Accessories:    The charging stand works well and (if I keep the surface of my bathroom counter fairly clean) the suction cups placed on bottom for stabiliy work fine.  The power pod that the razor can be charged in or stored for traveling also works well, but it would have been better if it had been designed so that the razor could go in there with the protective razor head cap on the heads.  As for the head cap itself, I don&#x27;t leave it on the razor between shaves as recommended in the manual because I want to make sure the razor heads are thoroughly dried out.  From past experience w/ other washables failure to so can eventually lead to a mildew smell coming from the razor blades and, frankly, I think the cap makes the razor look sort of \\&quot;clownish\\&quot; when it is on.    Other Observations:    The shaver is quiet compared to my Braun and seems to better conserve power too.  It is also fairly light-weight and feels pretty sturdy.    Conclusion:    For some people this razor will not be worth the money even if they get a reasonable deal as I did.  However, if you are not daunted by the price (which is lower than Braun&#x27;s current premium \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; model) and want a razor that combines good overall performance with the bells and whistles associated with an upper-end shaver, I believe you will be satisfied with the the 1090X model.</li>
    <li> Ok, first i&#x27;ve gotta say this is my first review of a product ever..  But i felt i had to because i did hesitate a lot to buy this product after a lot of mixed reviews, several visits to stores to see the product itself compare it with others and the fact that it&#x27;s been less reviewed than the Braun Pulsonic which might reflect in less popularity, etc etc..  i decided to take the risk and go again with Norelco, after all if it didn&#x27;t work for me i have the warranty to return the product.    And now after the first time I used it.. i can tell you that I&#x27;m not planning to return anything and keep it for a long time !!  My previous razor was a SPECTRA 8890XL wich was doing good but the plastic thing that holds the head was very fragile and broke for the 3rd time so.. i decided to upgrade.. and i&#x27;m very pleased  with the results  it says as with every Norelco razor that you should give 3 weeks of adjustment so the growth of the hair can be adjusted to the new system... so I can&#x27;t wait to see how will this perform by the 3rd week  :D     I know beards are differents and performance might depend on the shape of the face and kind of facial hair, so here it is: I&#x27;ve got a thick  black beard with a skinny and curvy jaw  IT DID and deliver really good.    All i can say that is a great shaver.. yes the trimmer is almost invisible but nothing that I can&#x27;t used to, and as a previous review mentioned if you don&#x27;t care about the digital display and nice extra lights go with a cheaper version...  personally i&#x27;m kind of unorganized and always on the run so to know exactly how many minutes are left is a must for me, but again  if you can live without all those \\&quot;lights\\&quot; go for the other models.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000TFNH9C Norelco Arcitec Razor - 1090X]]    I have been using a Norelco Spectra 8894XL for many years and decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to the new Arcitec with the modern design. Mistake!! It is not as good as the old one!</li>
    <li> The worst Philips shaver I had in over 25 years.  Cool, yes, but innefective.  The trimmer is a joke.  My old 9850XL was much better, I used to take 4-5 minutes to shave, now it takes me up to 9 minutes, plus I have to wash it after every shave.   Battery life is too short, and if I want to charge it on the go, I have to take the stand or the case with me as you cannot power it directly.  Design above usefullness, not for me!</li>
    <li> Amazon has weired policy of not matching their own lower price in 30 days or so. So I had bought one few months ago which I returned because amazon would not give me refund when they dropped price within 2 days of my order.  This time I bought on amazon because it showed up in lightening deals. Would not have bought otherwise    I have been using Norelco for few years now and this replaces my other Norelco whose batteries have died in about 7 years of usage (and replacement cost is more than product residual value.)  I have this shaver for 3 weeks now.  Pros: Nice shaver. Works great (better than my previous 8870XL or something). Shave is very clean and close.  Cons: Carry / charge case is bulkier than previous models. Smaller hair chamber than previous models. Cost. 200+ $$ is ridiculous for item like shaver.</li>
    <li> The circular blades won&#x27;t shave my neck no matter how I attack the hair.  Irritates and chafes my skin very effectively.  Can&#x27;t use the shaver while plugged into the outlet.  I am using a Braun 3 series now, significantly better shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors almost all my life and have enjoyed the close shaves that they&#x27;ve given me. I bought the Braun, activator, about 18 months ago (because it had the cleaning system) and have been very disappointed in the shave I received. I bought the new Norelco arcitec 1090X and have been very pleased with it. I&#x27;m getting a close shave in spots that I had to go over two or three times with the Braun. I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s shaves well after washing my face and letting it dry. I highly recommend this razor. It&#x27;s easy to clean and shaves close, what more can you ask.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razors for the last 10 years. I always buy the latest one that comes out. This is probably the best razor money can buy. It gives me a closer shave in less time than the previous model. The biggest difference was noriced when I shaved this morning. I had not shaved in 36 hours and it took the same time to shave as if I had 12 hours before.   It is defintely the coolest looking shaver.    A few negatives about this compared to the previous one I had:    It is louder, battery only lasts 65 min vs 100 on the older one, the old one told you how long you shaved for, you have to clean it every 2 shaves. Although this is annoying it only takes about 10 seconds to clean. ALso despite the fact that this is a small razor it takes more space to travel with if you use the included case. I will be using an older case for short trips.</li>
    <li> A very good shaver - easy to use, smooth, very easy to keep clean, and a long life battery.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It is however a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a month.  I find that it does a good job of shaving my face and neck.  It is quieter than my old 9060 Norelco shaver.  It is maybe a bit better and easier to hold than the 9060.  Simpler to clean but after three days of not shaving(I hate to shave), I need to empty the small space under the blades half way thru the shave.  I like the numbered battery meter, but you will pay dearly for this feature.  The hard case makes traveling with this razor a breeze.  The holding stand with it&#x27;s magnetic hold is very convenient.  The charging cycle is quite long at 2.5 hours.  Overall a very nice product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razors for the last 26 years. This razor gives the best shave of all of them hands down. The heads follow the contours of my chin, face and neck perfectly resulting in a significantly closer shave than the Spectra 8894 it replaces.</li>
    <li> This top-of-the-line NORELCO electric shaver, the Arcitec 1090, is absolutely,  and by far, the BEST electric shaver I have ever owned, and I am 74 years old on 31 August 2008.  It performs quietly and efficiently, it is easy to clean and maintain, and you definitely know you have in your hand a beautiful and outstanding product.  It is expensive, but like all things in life, you get what you pay for !    Ray Martel</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good razor, but it&#x27;s not worth such a premium price.  The much less expensive Norelco shavers with rotating heads do just about the same job.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer said, I really wanted to like this shaver. I used it for a couple of weeks and ended up going back to my Norelco 9190XL. I find the 9190XL gives me a smoother shave, a faster shave, has a much better trimmer, can be charged without a cradle, has a larger whisker reservoir, has better ergonomics, and has a better travel case. The Arcitec is definitely cuter, but unfortunately cute doesn&#x27;t get you very far in shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he hated it. He said the hair always clogged up inside and then it just didn&#x27;t shave correctly after that. I&#x27;m returning it today for a refund.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for over 30 years.  It is now a Philips Norelco and I have found it to be a great disappointment.  Out of the box the shaves were impressive but using it over a six month period, my satisfaction with it evaporated.  I recently ordered replacement blades for my previous Norelco model and have retired the Arcitec.  The Arcitec blades seem to dull materially quicker then previous models.  It does not work on cord and in my view does not travel well. The blades individually lift for cleaning and the stubble pit is too shallow. I have always owned top of the line Norelcos. Not sure they still exist,but if your choice is this or a more traditional Norelco...choose that.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does--shave as close as a blade. I have been shaving with electric razors for over 30 years, because once I finished school I simply didn&#x27;t have the time to shave with a blade anymore.  I&#x27;ve owned mostly the less expensive Norelco rotary razors, and they&#x27;ve been pretty good.  I have always resisted buying the new high tech models because I didn&#x27;t think going cordless or having a fancy stand bought a closer shave. I have a very tough beard and I had never used an electric shaver that came close to the shave a Gillete razor could give me..until now.  Friends and my father in law told me that this new Norelco system was incredible and they were right.  It took me less than a week to get used to it, and now I feel like I am shaving with blade razor.  All that&#x27;s missing is the shaving  cream.  The results are really oustanding. This was a gift from my wife and she spoiled me with the 1090X.  There are less expensive models that use the same cutting system without some of the bells and whistles if you want to save a few dollars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past 5 days and compared it to my \\&quot;old\\&quot; 9160XL shaver.  I wanted to like this new Arcitec design, but I ended up preferring my old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arcitec and XL-based shavers use the same blade design, though the blades are replaced individually for the XL and as one complete unit for the Arcitec.  The Arcitec was MUCH noiser than my 9160--surprisingly so.  The heads on the Arcitec are designed to spread open which gave me a better shave on my neck.  However, the blades don&#x27;t \\&quot;float\\&quot; on the Arcitec, so when pushed against my chin there is no give like on the 9160XL, so the 9160XL gives me a better shave on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the worst for last, the side burn trimmer is terrible.  It&#x27;s very small and doesn&#x27;t protrude from the razor more than about 1/8\\&quot;.  I literally could not trim my sideburns because I couldn&#x27;t see them--the large razor head completely shadows the trimmer.  This was a surprising departure from the large trimmer on my 9160XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the shave itself is fine.  Since the Arcitec no longer uses the \\&quot;floating head technology\\&quot; I actually thought I was getting a slightly closer shave than with the 9160XL.  However, as a test I shaved half of my face with the 9160XL and half with the Arcitec and asked my wife to tell me which was closer.  She chose the 9160XL.  My conclusion on the shave is that they shave equivalently, neither better than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as much as I wanted this new Arcitec shaver (received it as a gift), it&#x27;s too noisy and the small side burn trimmer is a deal killer.  And for that matter, my \\&quot;old\\&quot; 9160XL still works fine.  I&#x27;m sending mine back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Well, I never sent it back and I kept using it, and, well, I like it better now.  I found a better way to use the trimmer--remove the razor head.  If your not familiar with this style of Norelco, the individual blades are not replaceable.  The entire head is replaced.  So when I was playing around with this, I removed the head and thought, hey, THIS is how to use the trimmer!  I also do believe it shaves closer than the older \\&quot;floating head\\&quot; razor heads.  I was concerned that the cost of replacing the head would be more expensive, and it is a couple dollars more than a set of individual heads but not enough to persuade me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m keeping it, and I&#x27;d change my rating to 4 stars if I could.  The reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 is because it&#x27;s still noisy; noticeably more noisy than the Norelco it replaces.to use the trimmer!

    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the razor for my fathera few years  . He said it did not work so well.</li>
    <li> My husband shaves twice a day and with this product, he&#x27;s not sure he needs to shave twice!  What more can I say?  R. Cross</li>
    <li> In shaving for the last 30 years, this is the best razor I have ever owned.  I even bought my dad one for his birthday and he loves it.  Excellent cut, follows the contour of my face and is excellent in overall performance.</li>
    <li> I have used the Arcitec 1090 for about a year now and am fortunate in that I never threw out my old Norelco 5801XL. The first problem is the pop up trimmer, on the Arcitec it is useless. When I need one I always go to the 5801XL. The second problem is that sometimes I don&#x27;t shave on weekends so Monday mornings with the Arcitec the job gets only half done and I have to finish up with the older model. I was going to buy new blades for the Arcitec but decided to spring for a Speed XL instead. Sorry Philips Norelco but for me your flagship model has hit an iceberg.</li>
    <li> This is a high tech shaver, and it works all right, but it doesn&#x27;t shave any better than my previous Philips Norelco shaver which cost less than half as much.</li>
    <li> Merchandise arrived as promised and packaging condition was great.</li>
    <li> Bought these several years ago and both my son and I love the job it does. Also a good fit in you hand.</li>
