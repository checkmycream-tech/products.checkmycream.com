      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products.</li>
      <li>It is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>LOVE the smell of this.</li>
      <li>the smell is really nice and the product absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>very sweet ...</li>
      <li>It is ideal for a facial lotion as well</li>
      <li>This body butter is great and leaves my skin really smooth and soft!</li>
      <li>but I like that it doesn&#x27;t suffocate my skin and absorbs easily while still leaving a layer of moisture.</li>
      <li>After trying the tester (which was HUGE), I was so happy with this product and my skin was so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Easy smooth and luscious to the skin...</li>
      <li>DEFINITELY BUY as you won&#x27;t regret how great your skin feels.</li>
      <li>It has a light, clean smell and no greasy feel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so creamy and rich but doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin and make you feel like you globbed on a bunch of grease.</li>
      <li>However, I love the smell so much that I can forgive this cream almost anything!</li>
      <li>i personally LOVE SO MUCH this products!</li>
      <li>great for dry skin</li>
      <li>This is wonderful, It feels like a luxury, thick, smooth and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and dense enough to actually absorb into the skin with a very pleasant almond aroma.  </li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced as well!</li>
      <li>Love it ,makes the skin soooo very soft .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s warm, sweet, earthy, and fresh all the same time!</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m very smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>The body butter itself did not hydrate my skin as effectively as the olive oil formula by the same manufacturer which I will be ordering in its place.</li>
      <li>This company products are never a disappointment.  </li>
      <li>Much cheaper than super fancy brands that have inferior</li>
      <li>The product is much larger than Body Shop products, and the consistency is much more liquidy; however, it still moisturizes.</li>
      <li>NO HEAVY FRAGRENCE, SMOOTH AND SILKY.  </li>
      <li>I have the honey almond dry oil as well and both products are amazing &amp; the smell is very calming.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;body butter&#x27; is gentle enough for these precious children&#x27;s hands, feet and elbows, too.  </li>
      <li>My introduction to these products by  &#x27;c. Booth&#x27; was the dry oil mist and from there it&#x27;s become a favorite.</li>
      <li>and now it&#x27;s disappearing extra quickly because everyone loves it!</li>
      <li>My wife and I have been using this for years and absolutely swear by it.  </li>
      <li>As a result, I tired this stuff out, and for the price, it is great.</li>
      <li>We HIGHLY recommend this body butter.</li>
      <li>Just wish it were a little more like the &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; consistency.</li>
      <li>It has a thick consistency and a nice scent</li>
      <li>This is a new grail product in my beauty regimen.</li>
      <li>This body butter made my skin feel so soft non greasy....</li>
      <li>it makes your skin so soft.</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft after using this and it actually lasts now.</li>
      <li>This is such a large tub and will last me a long time.</li>
      <li>It is rich and thick and goes on so silky on my skin.</li>
      <li>These C. Booth Body Butters have more as a mousse texture being thicker than any other body creams but bit lighter than common butters.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product! Moisturizes without leaving greasy look or feel. Light, pleasant scent that does not interfere with cologne or overwhelm.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product!  the smell is really nice and the product absorbs quickly.  would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, It feels like a luxury, thick, smooth and your skins just soaks it in. Nice fragrance as well</li>
    <li> Amazing product and smells lovely</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion, like a drink of water for my skin.  Made the mistake of taking a jar of this to work and now it&#x27;s disappearing extra quickly because everyone loves it!</li>
    <li> I put this on my feet at night before bed. I wear sandals almost every day and my feet get dry. This helps rehydrate them overnight. Not oily and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have to give this body butter 5 stars because I am in LOVE with this scent. It&#x27;s warm, sweet, earthy, and fresh all the same time! It&#x27;s the only lotion I can put on at night and still smell a hint of the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a silky cream with almost a hint of gel-like texture to it. It&#x27;s not as thick as some body butters but I like that it doesn&#x27;t suffocate my skin and absorbs easily while still leaving a layer of moisture. I can use it in the winter or summer that way. It&#x27;s great to rub all over after a shower. It makes me feel so relaxed and pampered. I sometimes add a drop or two of body oil to it to make it extra rich and put it on my feet under thick socks before bed and wake up to baby-soft feet!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from Ulta from purchasing some products and I had never tried this before and probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased for myself. After trying the tester (which was HUGE), I was so happy with this product and my skin was so soft and smooth. I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily, it smells great, and my skin is so happy! I didn&#x27;t know how big this tub was for the price, but OMG SUCH A STEAL. This is such a large tub and will last me a long time. Can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products. DEFINITELY BUY as you won&#x27;t regret how great your skin feels.</li>
    <li> works great! love the smell!</li>
    <li> My introduction to these products by  &#x27;c. Booth&#x27; was the dry oil mist and from there it&#x27;s become a favorite. The fragrance is delicate with that warmth added by vanilla. My granddaughter (almost 7) describes it as &#x27;yummy!&#x27; The lotion is great and this &#x27;body butter&#x27; is perfect for feet, knees and elbows . . . or just a luxury slather after a warm bath/shower. Pamper time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandchildren approved: the dry oil mist is a simple &#x27;fix it&#x27; for bumps and bruises (do not use for lacerations or burns!). The boy child is almost 5 and  he even responds to the soothing fragrance. The &#x27;body butter&#x27; is gentle enough for these precious children&#x27;s hands, feet and elbows, too.  A &#x27;relaxing&#x27; fragrance and pamper perfect!</li>
    <li> I had just finished applying to my hands as this email was opened.  :)  **Very happy with the product and I purchased three on my last order. I wanted one by the computer, in the car, and by the nightstand. I typically have very dry skin and the Body Butter works well for me especially on my hands. Very reasonably priced as well!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin. This is the only thing I have found that works all day. I haven&#x27;t found anything that compares to it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I love the fragrance of it. Especially good for hands and feet.</li>
    <li> This stuff is UH-mazing!  It smells so good, I get complimented every time I wear it.  It&#x27;s so creamy and rich but doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin and make you feel like you globbed on a bunch of grease.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this for years and absolutely swear by it.  It&#x27;s smooth and dense enough to actually absorb into the skin with a very pleasant almond aroma.  We HIGHLY recommend this body butter.</li>
    <li> GAVE THIS ITEM 5 STARS BECAUSE IT WORKS.  I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS AND HHAVE SEEN A DEFINATE IMPROVEMENT IN MY SKIN.  I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN IN WINTER AND THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFE SAVER. NO HEAVY FRAGRENCE, SMOOTH AND SILKY.  GET THIS ONE!</li>
    <li> This body butter is great and leaves my skin really smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> Has an awful scent not what i was expecting. Sent it back!</li>
    <li> These C. Booth Body Butters have more as a mousse texture being thicker than any other body creams but bit lighter than common butters. i personally LOVE SO MUCH this products! They leave skin feeling extremely moisturized and soft. I use it for my elbows, knees, heels, whenever my skin is feeling dehydrated and results are awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is my favorite moisturizer.  It has a light, clean smell and no greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Sooooooo soothing. Love it ,makes the skin soooo very soft .</li>
    <li> My husband uses this on his feet. Not greasy at all great moisturizer . Great for diabetics he for an A for improvement from his podiatrist !</li>
    <li> I found the scent overpowering and not at all like either honey or almonds.  The body butter itself did not hydrate my skin as effectively as the olive oil formula by the same manufacturer which I will be ordering in its place.</li>
    <li> This body butter made my skin feel so soft non greasy.... my feet feel like I went and had a pedicure.</li>
    <li> Great  lotion. hard to find.last a long time.It is ideal for a facial lotion as well It has a thick consistency and a nice scent</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the feel of this on the skin after it dries</li>
    <li> Love it. Not too greasy. I have been a repeat buyer of this product.</li>
    <li> I live in the cold, white north.&lt;br /&gt;I go through several of these over the winter, but they also work wonderfully at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little high but not a bank-breaker. Much cheaper than super fancy brands that have inferior products.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Very similar to stuff I used to buy in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;This scent is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This body butter is a great product. It keep my skin moisturize all day long. It is rich and thick and goes on so silky on my skin.</li>
    <li> Easy smooth and luscious to the skin...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of C. Booth. But never tried honey almond scent and it is amazing!!!!!</li>
    <li> This company products are never a disappointment.  I love the scent and love the texture and results on my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the creamiest and last a long time without being greasy at all. I believe it is the best body butter I have ever used</li>
    <li> I love this body butter it makes your skin so soft. I have the honey almond dry oil as well and both products are amazing &amp; the smell is very calming.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Smells very sweet ...like warm vanilla(:</li>
    <li> great for dry skin i love to put it all over my body it is nice and smooth. i will order another one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an inexpensive and effective body butter and I finally found it. My skin is so soft after using this and it actually lasts now. It&#x27;s impossible to keep the humidity up in my house so my skin is always extremely dry and ashen. Now I&#x27;m very smooth and soft. It even seems to be bringing out the colors of my tattoos. This is a new grail product in my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> Creamy and delightful</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell of this. Just wish it were a little more like the &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; consistency. I know others like the fact that it is creamier than traditional butter creams, but I bought body butter expecting it to be...well...body butter consistency. However, I love the smell so much that I can forgive this cream almost anything!</li>
    <li> I have some of the driest skin out there, not quite eczema, but it is definitely dry, and I have all the problems that come along with the dry skin. I always had to use the really thick body butter from the Body Shop, but that stuff is crazy expensive for how much I go through. As a result, I tired this stuff out, and for the price, it is great. The product is much larger than Body Shop products, and the consistency is much more liquidy; however, it still moisturizes. Also, the honey almond stuff smells like pumpkin spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the body shop body butter is more moisturizing, but I always felt like their stuff was too moisturizing and would sit on top of my skin, so the C.Booth body butter is a great dupe.</li>
