      <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Anything goes smells better</li>
      <li>I actually love all of the products from Devoted but this one delivers a no streak bronze color.  </li>
      <li>But all I really care about is if it tans great</li>
      <li>more results.</li>
      <li>It will stain in between your fingers, etc so be sure to use a baby wipe before</li>
      <li>Was better than &amp;#34;la moment &amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Depends on your natural skin tone ,I would say this one is good for fair to medium skin tones.</li>
      <li>and I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Make sure you spread the product evenly on your skin.</li>
      <li>lotion contains More bronzing agents, and calls for more caution when applying around the hands and feet.</li>
      <li>I also like how it goes on nice and smooth when applying it.</li>
      <li>I assure you, you will come out with a lovely goldon</li>
      <li>Just make sure you wipe between your fingers and toes</li>
      <li>It smells great and works fast.</li>
      <li>I would probably purchase another one once this one is done :)</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find this product for this price!  </li>
      <li>This is the best lotion to use better then the other bronzers.</li>
      <li>has a great smell and leaves your skin soft.</li>
      <li>and I already have a nice golden tan.</li>
      <li>I am not orange but have a nice golden brown</li>
      <li>I am very fair skinned (more like super white)</li>
      <li>This is the only lotion that gives a great tan with no streaks love it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this will WOW you.u do get darker hence the amount of bronzer in the product,but there are better ones for darker skin.medium &amp; fair skin</li>
      <li>This was a good price in comparison to the high prices that tanning salons charge for their products</li>
      <li>, it will not turn you a funny color, if you are using it when you already have a nice tan built up.</li>
      <li>First time using this lotion &amp; i have tanned 3 times using it &amp; have a nice tan.</li>
      <li>This is the best lotion to get dark.</li>
      <li>It gives you an immediate bronze glow after just the first time using it and gets better the more and longer you use it.</li>
      <li>By far the best bronzer out of ANY of the new 2011 collection from Devoted Creations.</li>
      <li>Noticed a darker tan with this lotion from the very first use!</li>
      <li>And before I would get nice and tanned and have a nice bronze look and now after numerous uses ; nothing.</li>
      <li>Gets me Dark for sure, but be sure you rub this stuff in good and wash hands or it will stain.</li>
      <li>This tanning lotion is the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and over the last 2+ yrs, I have tried many different brands and types.  </li>
      <li>The people at this company are really friendly and helpful too.</li>
      <li>You also need to wipe your hands clean or they too will start to get discolored.</li>
      <li>nothing special at all.</li>
      <li>But I can live with that since a shower is an easy fix:)</li>
      <li>The ATO is AMAZING and is comparible to \\&quot;Brown Sugar and Fig\\&quot; from Bath and Body Works, with a masculine twist.</li>
      <li>and when I wipe off with a WHITE towel afterwards there is no bronzing color on the towel as ANY good bronzer would leave.</li>
      <li>I loved it will use it again next year</li>
      <li>Make sure you spread it evenly because it will tan you fast (or not if you miss a spot)</li>
      <li>Several times i have darker areas where i didnt do a good job of wiping.  </li>
      <li>, i think there smoking crack charging that much when you can go online and find better tanning loctios for way</li>
      <li>The smell is alright, not bad..</li>
      <li>After testing this out and a couple others..and a full bottle of extreme situation (smells great)</li>
      <li>I bought a sample of this the other day and it didnt smell all that great</li>
      <li>BUT as long as you make sure and remove any excess lotion from between your fingers and toes, your result will be an amazing golden tan.</li>
      <li>and I wanted a lotion that would give quick results.</li>
      <li>That cleared quickly though</li>
      <li>Spent almost a full day looking at the available lotion options on Amazon, this one stood out i kept coming back to it because of all the wonderful reviews and hype.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results from this lotion and can also recommend the following from Devoted Creation&#x27;s line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is by far the BEST tanning lotion I have ever used; extremely dark after 1 month of tanning ..</li>
      <li>I am an avid tanner and this lotion rocks!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am questioning if this is the real product ! My skin is SO dry after tanning.. usually I&#x27;d be kinda mosteri zed after tanning from the lotion. But this no. I see no darkening or bronzing. and when I wipe off with a WHITE towel afterwards there is no bronzing color on the towel as ANY good bronzer would leave.</li>
    <li> I got the tan I was looking for or paid for I loved it will use it again next year</li>
    <li> This product is great! The instant color is amazing and I love the smell. A little musty.. not girly at all.Thank you!</li>
    <li> has a great smell and leaves your skin soft. I like the color too no orange tint! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. I use this and Anything Goes. Anything goes smells better but Forever Black makes you darker!</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST tanning lotion I have ever used; extremely dark after 1 month of tanning .. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My tanning salon sells only devoted creations.  I bought a sample of this the other day and it didnt smell all that great beforehand but i wanted to like it since it is boasted to be great..  After tanning i still didnt care for it.  I will not be buying a bottle of this.  After testing this out and a couple others..and a full bottle of extreme situation (smells great) i will be going back to designer skin.  more results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok product, it smells good before tanning, but not as good after. I am medium dark skin and it gives me a nice darker color but it still makes me look orange sometimes. Make sure you spread the product evenly on your skin. Great price compared to the salons&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Great indoor tanning lotion, it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t smell like burnt skin when you are done tanning either!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this product for this price!  At my local tanning salon, the exact same product costs three times as much!!!  I simply can&#x27;t afford to get my lotions there.  It&#x27;s not a matter of purchasing it here or there; I couldn&#x27;t cover the cost there and would not have bought it.  The people at this company are really friendly and helpful too.</li>
    <li> By far the best bronzer out of ANY of the new 2011 collection from Devoted Creations. The ATO is AMAZING and is comparible to \\&quot;Brown Sugar and Fig\\&quot; from Bath and Body Works, with a masculine twist. The lotion, has so many bronzers in it, that it appears to be a purple color as it comes out of the bottle (Kinda scary) BUT as long as you make sure and remove any excess lotion from between your fingers and toes, your result will be an amazing golden tan. I would DEF. reccommend this product to any other \\&quot;tanaholics\\&quot; out there :)</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion to get dark. I&#x27;ve tried like 10 different ones like white 2 black or phoenician but this lotion gets me dark in 2 sessions. Sometimes I miss a week but then I use this lotion and I see a tan in 1 use. The 4 stars is just because after u get out u smell like u just tanned. This is the best lotion to use better then the other bronzers. U won&#x27;t regret getin it</li>
    <li> First time using this lotion &amp; i have tanned 3 times using it &amp; have a nice tan. Hoping it will go darker more as i keep using. It gives you a nice brown, streak free tan :-) i purchased another bottle already.</li>
    <li> This lotion is highly recommended at my salon where they sell it for $90.00, but I got it for a little over $30 with shipping. I&#x27;ve read other reviews where people were sold counterfeit products, but my bottle arrived brand new and shrink-wrapped. It definitely got me darker after my base tan was built up, but my favorite part is that it actually smells better AFTER tanning than before. It smells like a VS lotion. I haven&#x27;t noticed any orangeing of my hands, but I do wash them after I get out of the bed. I recommend Forever Black 100%!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and over the last 2+ yrs, I have tried many different brands and types.  Devoted Creations Forever Black gets you really dark and fast.  Also the bronzers don&#x27;t seem to wash away when showering or bathing like some other products.  Be careful to wash your hands and in between fingers so you won&#x27;t have streaks.  I also like Devoted Creations Code and Trinity 3.  Only problem with Code is that it is in such a huge bottle and very little lotion, especially for the price.  Sometimes I purchase all three and make a tanning \\&quot;cocktale\\&quot; because I like the tingle from Trinity 3, and how hydrated and silky Code makes your skin feel.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that gives a great tan with no streaks love it</li>
    <li> This gets you really dark.  I did two days in a row of indoor tanning and I am super dark.  I am nuetral on the scent.  LIke another user stated, make sure you wipe between your fingers good.  Several times i have darker areas where i didnt do a good job of wiping.  It is somewhat embarrassing I work in an office and it looks like i have dirty hands...lol....I think this product is a definately must have.  The price is way cheaper than the tanning salons too.!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. It gives you an immediate bronze glow after just the first time using it and gets better the more and longer you use it. I would definitely buy this item again, and will..</li>
    <li> i have tryed a bunch of tanning loctions, and forever black is the best one by far, i was already tan but this got me way darker and just in one sitting!!! my husband is very pale and i got him to start tanning, he was only able to get a darker shade of white but within 2 uses of forever black he is tan oh my i mean tan, such a great loction!! i will be buying some more soon and sticking with forever black as long as i tan, and price isnt bad at all, seeing as in the store tanning loctions are 65 and above, i think there smoking crack charging that much when you can go online and find better tanning loctios for way cheeper like forever black</li>
    <li> It was likle water and had a nasty smell</li>
    <li> Noticed a darker tan with this lotion from the very first use! So it does the job....I also like how it goes on nice and smooth when applying it. The smell is alright, not bad.. You can&#x27;t ever expect to smell like you put fresh perfume when stepping out of a tanning bed or stand up. Over all it&#x27;s a good lotion. I would probably purchase another one once this one is done :)</li>
    <li> Spent almost a full day looking at the available lotion options on Amazon, this one stood out i kept coming back to it because of all the wonderful reviews and hype. I knew it was not a tingle lotion and that it was not top of the line but not cheap so i gave it a go. i tan 3 times a week in a stand up bed and with this lotion i notice a difference but nothing special at all. I would say some of the less costing bottles would work just as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells great and works fast. I have used it four times and already have achieved 5 levels of deep tan. I am not orange but have a nice golden brown look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give a warning however....you need to treat the lotion like a self-tanning product because of the heavy bronzer or you will get streaks as I discovered last week. You also need to wipe your hands clean or they too will start to get discolored. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I tan a lot thought i couldn&#x27;t get any darker so decided to give this a try as dark as i was im even darker now i recommend this product 100%!!!</li>
    <li> Last week I went to the tanning salon, and ran into a friend. After I noticed how dark she was, I immediately asked her what she used. She said it was Forever Black. I went inside to see how much it was...how about $89!?! I passed, due to the price, came home to read reviews, then ordered it online.&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t think I was going to notice a big difference, but I was wrong! I noticed a deeper tan right after my first use. Amazing!!! I will tell you that my feet and legs are usually the hardest to tan. My tan is well blended all over now, no streaks, no stains in between toes or fingers. (Key is to make sure to apply well and wipe off/wash your hands immediately). The blending was noticable on day 2.&lt;br /&gt;I have told the staff at the salon that this was by far one of the best lotions I have used. I previously purchased Black, and I still like this more. Definitely worth the money to spend on Amazon.com. :) Very Happy!&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY downside is the smell afterwards, smells like something burnt. But I can live with that since a shower is an easy fix:)</li>
    <li> I have recently become acquainted with the Devoted Creation&#x27;s tanning lotion line.&lt;br /&gt;Well, so far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought a full size of the forever black after giving it a couple test trys at my salon. I decided to go ahead and make the purchase online to save me some cash.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is a step 3. Yes, a step 3, not the usual step 2.&lt;br /&gt;It is also a black bronzer so that means its going to be your darkest bronzing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion contains More bronzing agents, and calls for more caution when applying around the hands and feet. It will stain in between your fingers, etc so be sure to use a baby wipe before and after you get in the tanning bed on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;No, it will not turn you a funny color, if you are using it when you already have a nice tan built up. Some people may be skeptical due to forever blacks purplish brown color. I assure you, you will come out with a lovely goldon brown!&lt;br /&gt;Forever Black also has a yummy scent that is fresh and won&#x27;t leave you smelling too horrible after tanning. The reason I say too horrible is because you shouldn&#x27;t expect to smell completely fresh after using a lotion filled with heavy bronzers. But, the smell isnt so strong that you would be afraid to run to the store, or the gym afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results from this lotion and can also recommend the following from Devoted Creation&#x27;s line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust Fund Baby&lt;br /&gt;Extreme Situation&lt;br /&gt;White 2 Black&lt;br /&gt;Made 2 Be Dark&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Tanning!</li>
    <li> Awesome bronzer!  Just make sure you wipe between your fingers and toes so you don&#x27;t go orange there.  This bronzer does NOT make you look orange, not at all.  I tan once a week and look like I just came back from the Caribbean:-). Buy this lotion, it is the best.  Wish it smelled as good as JWoww&#x27;s, but it works better.....happy tanning:-)</li>
    <li> I used this lotion for the first time yesterday and I have to say that I&#x27;m very pleased! It smells so good after tanning, which I seem to always get the ones that smell horrible after tanning. I definitly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Really like the bronzers! Per other reviews, will turn space between your fingers if you don&#x27;t clean them promptly after tanning. Great lotion.</li>
    <li> I was not &#x27;blown away&#x27; with this product either.  It works ok, but this one has a super strong odor that stinks! I will not buy this again, but will use what I have until it is gone.  Thus far, my favorite tanning/bronzing lotion is the Playboy (although it has a VERY strong perfume odor to it, but the results are great!)</li>
    <li> not a good product. Ive used better lotions than this.</li>
    <li> Worked amazing. Super dark after 3 visits. I had to cut down to 1 a week just to keep from being too dark. Loved it. Buying another bottle today</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Was better than &amp;#34;la moment &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Smells good and gives me a nice tan. It&#x27;s my go-to for tanning lotions just because I like the smell.</li>
    <li> best lotion ever, A++ give a perfect bronze color i was looking for. got 2 bottles for less than half the price of 1</li>
    <li> I compared this to the one at the salon by squeezing out a very small amount and comparing it to theirs. I have heard that companies water these down but refused to believe it due to other positive experiences on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t even want to attempt to use it; as it smelled and looked so different than what they had, I ended up sending it back.</li>
    <li> I posted an earlier review but now as I&#x27;ve been using this, the consistency is very liquid as opposed to the one I&#x27;ve used before from the actual tanning salon. And before I would get nice and tanned and have a nice bronze look and now after numerous uses ; nothing. Can&#x27;t say I would buy again. Not sure what&#x27;s up with that. Maybe it&#x27;s gone bad? I can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s so liquidy.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t the best I have used, but not the worst.  The smell is ok, and it does give you a little color.  Be sure to wash your hands good, they will get orange.  Made the back of my legs very spotty with a noticable stained look.</li>
    <li> This gave me the best damn tan ever. I was already tan when I got it. Then ran out of my lotion. &amp; wanted to try something different. . This enhanced my tan the 1st time using it. Would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. The only complaint is the after smell. But all I really care about is if it tans great and it does!</li>
    <li> Love it! Have used this product before. Smells great &amp; works well. I get dark quickly when I use it.</li>
    <li> Helped me get dark pretty quick. I am fair skin complexion.</li>
    <li> FOR THE PRICE I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A BIGGER BOTTLE. PROB WONT BUY AGAIN AS ALSO LEFT ORANGE COLOR RATHER THAN A TAN</li>
    <li> I read a lot of different lotion reviews and did some research before I purchased forever black. I have to say I am very impressed. I am very fair skinned (more like super white) and I only tan about 3 months out of the year and I wanted a lotion that would give quick results. I literally have only tanned 2 times for about 7 min each time since I&#x27;m just starting off this season and I already have a nice golden tan. I know with this lotion I will be at my desired tan very fast. It&#x27;s definitely a great lotion. The smell isn&#x27;t that great but that&#x27;s my only complaint. I will definitely buy this again .</li>
    <li> great bronzer and it smells good after.  the siicone factor in it works amazing !  you have got to try it.</li>
    <li> Smells good, leaves skin soft and you see results pretty quickly,  but made me a little orange looking. I just wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this lotion.</li>
    <li> Good color but peppery smell!</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Spreads on the skin well and works well. This was a good price in comparison to the high prices that tanning salons charge for their products</li>
    <li> I am an avid tanner and this lotion rocks! I notices results after two uses. Will order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downfall is the first week or so I broke out from it. That cleared quickly though</li>
    <li> Depends on your natural skin tone ,I would say this one is good for fair to medium skin tones.If u  have a naturally darker skin tone or are already pretty tan I don&#x27;t think this will WOW you.u do get darker hence the amount of bronzer in the product,but there are better ones for darker skin.medium &amp; fair skin this Will get u noticebly darker without  looking to fake.smells good,great moisterizing. Either way apply evenly &amp; let sit for a few hours before showering.most Of these bronzers have self tanning ingredients that work with tanning bed.when tanning in natural sun &#x27;maui babe browning Lotion&#x27; great for all skin types get a naturally brown color very quickly!</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning lotion. I have naturally pale skin and it gives me a nice, deep tan. Great price. I pay $87 for this in my tanning salon.</li>
    <li> After one use I could tell already, love it!! Do wash hands tho</li>
    <li> Seems a little watered down.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Scent us a little strong at first but fades within a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Talk about getting bronzed!  I actually love all of the products from Devoted but this one delivers a no streak bronze color.  Careful about putting on your feet, elbows and fingers.  Just apply a light, thin coat of moisturizer in the areas that are prone to dry, cracking and discoloration from the bronzer and you have a great tan with no problems.  Take time to apply it properly.</li>
    <li> I love only using dark bronzing lotions that give me instant tanning results like this one. I don&#x27;t need to tan as often.</li>
    <li> This product is very difficult to apply evenly and leaves a lot of streaks. I threw the bottle away half empty. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Make sure you spread it evenly because it will tan you fast (or not if you miss a spot)</li>
    <li> Gets me Dark for sure, but be sure you rub this stuff in good and wash hands or it will stain. I have a few small brown blobs in certain spots i didnt rub well enough</li>
    <li> No greasy after feeling, leaves skin soft &amp; smooth, clears acne and natural darkening color when used.  Highly recommend!  Been using for years.</li>
