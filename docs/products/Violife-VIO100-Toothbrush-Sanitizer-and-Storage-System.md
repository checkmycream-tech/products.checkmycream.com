      <li>but most customers won&#x27;t have issues when the product is under warranty</li>

      <li>and i still wasn&#x27;t safe.</li>

      <li>send 2 more of the shorter pegs.  </li>
      <li>It would have fit in nicely with the bathroom decor.</li>

      <li>I feel much better knowing the toothbrushes are sanitized.  </li>

      <li>You do have to regularly clean the plastic top and the cup in the bottom, or else build up will occur.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I can take the system apart and clean it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Company does not stand behind their products, which break frequently.</li>
    <li> We received it in a timely manner. works like it states. Only issue is that the button is a little tough for my kids to push. This is our second toothbrush sanitizer from this company. The other one lasted us 2 years and then the bulb burnt out.</li>
    <li> THIS is GREAT!  easy to use and easy to clean.  I feel better knowing that my toothbrush is SANITIZERED! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I bought this more than a year ago and I had it replaced once.  I tried to get it replaced again, and the customer strongly suggests that you buy a new bulb.  I&#x27;ve bought a new bulb twice so far, and they still want you to buy a new bulb even after I&#x27;ve sent them an email to have my unit replaced.    However, I ran into another roadblock, because on their website, they advertise a 2 year warranty.  When I tried to claim it, customer service told me that the customer was supposed to buy it at the time of purchase.  Sounds like false advertising to me.      I&#x27;ve exchanged several emails with them, but to no avail.      1 star for lasting &lt;12 months, and it looks nice on the counter top.  1 star for first time replacement.  They sent in a replacement unit right away.     After that, they don&#x27;t care about you, nor do they care to help you.     I would rather buy something to keep my toothbrushes up, and boil them once in awhile.</li>
    <li> This is great idea: more than one brush or flosser can be sanitized at same time.  However, we&#x27;ve had to replace it about every year due to the deterioration of the on/off power button and connection.  You&#x27;d think that after creating a good product, the manufacturer would see that it has a decent use life.  We&#x27;ve had to replace the whole unit even before the bulb wore out.  We may switch to using the battery powered individual type if this one goes too quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and kept it for myself. I enjoy knowing that my husband and I sanitize our brushes daily. No colds,no flu. Awsome.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this crap. I don&#x27;t think it sanitizes the toothbrush. There is NO FDA registered and or UL approved. The unit itself does NOT LAST LONG too. I don&#x27;t understand why this crap still sell in here ???</li>
    <li> I purchased two VioLight units a little over 3 years ago and have been relatively happy with them.  Even had a problem with one not working only a few months after I had purchased it, and the company sent out a new base which fixed the known problem.    Recently on one of my units the soft on/off button has actually split open, is becoming hard and brittle, and it is becoming very difficult to turn it off and on.  I would think being the most used part of the unit (that would be pressed at least once if not several times a day if up to four people are using it) that this would not break/tear easily.    I emailed customer service asking if I could somehow replace the button, and that I would not expect an essential part of the unit to fail after a only few years (especially given the price)! Their response (complete with no capitalization, incorrect grammar, spelling errors and lack of punctuation in only a few sentence response!) was that they don&#x27;t sell the bases separately, but they would let me purchase another new unit on their website for a 20% discount.    Sorry, I will be looking elsewhere for a replacement toothbrush sanitizer.  As much as I like this unit (and have given it as a gift many times) I will not purchased from a company that does not stand behind their products and does not value their customers.  The little soft blue circular button is present on many of their products, so buyer beware!</li>
    <li> The toothbrush sanitizer seems to work well, but could stand improving.  There&lt;br /&gt;is no cover (or lid) for the unit, so why bother to sanitize if your toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;remains \\&quot;open\\&quot; to dust, etc?  I went to the hardware store and purchased a plastic&lt;br /&gt;cover that sits over the toothbrush area, but would definitely recommend that a&lt;br /&gt;tight-fitting cover be included with the unit.</li>
    <li> I love my Violife Toothbrush Sanitizer!  I&#x27;m almost a &amp;#34;germ-a-phobe&amp;#34; so it eases my mind a great deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 6 months ago. Since then, it has quit working. I think the light is burned out, since there doesn&#x27;t appear to be anything wrong with the cord. I can&#x27;t find a place to by a replacement bulb, but....it shouldn&#x27;t have burned out that fast in the first place. Based on my experience I give this product a big fat \\&quot;Goose Egg:!!!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I can take the system apart and clean it.  It works great for both my electric and small and long toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for a love&#x27;d one. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> We bought this product in January, and it stopped working after a few months.  I called the company, and was told I would have to buy another unit.  When I asked her why I would buy another after the first one stopped working, she said she could offer me a discount on the new unit.  I have no idea why anyone would want to repurchase a product that only lasts a few months.  The unit also had to be taken apart every few days and cleaned because of gunk that would settle and build up in the tray where the brushes sit.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with our vio light.     We purchased it 9 months ago. I have not had to replace any of the parts.    Assembly: you must put it together properly and click the top piece in place  or the safety feature will not allow the light to turn on. I didn&#x27;t figure this out at first,   and it appeared to not work.    Easy Cleaning:I put the top pieces in the top of my dishwasher after I rinse them out.     I really like it, and am looking for the travel component as well.  I think it is a bit expensive but would never go back  to storing my family&#x27;s toothbrushes any other way. Especially since my young children often catch colds.</li>
    <li> This not only cleans your toothbrushes, it makes them last longer too!&lt;br /&gt;Your mouth will be cleaner and thank you for it!</li>
    <li> The translucent cap on top began to crack almost immediately, even though it did not take any sort of abuse. In short order it was shattered and crumbling in to many pieces.  The violight is also difficult to keep clean, so the crumbling combined with the build-up of toothpaste scum makes it look like a piece of junk.  Without the top to hold the brushes, the violight is nearly useless.</li>
    <li> Used this product for a few months and just assumed it was working. Then one night my husband took a close look at his toothbrush and there was mold on the end of it. When we examined the inside of the Sanitizer closely we found that there was a variety of gunk, mold etc inside. If these things can grow right next to the bulb how much do you think it is doing for your toothbrush?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what I was expecting, however had I paid full price for this item, I would have been annoyed.  Luckily, I had a $20 coupon, so $30 seemed more reasonable for what it is worth.  I can&#x27;t scientifically tell you if it works, however at least some sort of sanitizer is better than the nothing we had before.</li>
    <li> This product is priced by the market and is not not priced by the technology it uses (research and development) or actual components which make it up. Materials and labor cost approx. $5.00 so what constitutes a $50.00 price tag? Is it the value of aesthetics (packaging)or the value of piece of mind (bacteria BE GONE)that sells this product when many other products or practices do the same thing? Perhaps it is the cost of shipping junky little consumables around and around the globe that constitutes $50.00. Either way the mark up on this product is grossly high and other lower cost products should be sought after if this is your preferred method of sterilization (that being an old but effective method of UV light).  So if you have expendable income then why not donate it the CEO of a NOT so local manufacturer abroad? You will have a clean mouth and they will have your money.</li>
    <li> Our family has had both products since before the holidays. &lt;br /&gt;We use it both at home and while travelling. &lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and is effective. &lt;br /&gt;All of our friends and family are very excited about the product. &lt;br /&gt;We try the best we can to be a healthy family and the system fits right in.</li>
    <li> Bought this item in January and around June I had to start jiggling the power cord to make it work and now it is September and it has stopped working completely.</li>
    <li> Just bought the product a few months ago and forgot to review it.  Now I am buying it as a gift. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Product works great!  My 2 yr old son loves turning it on and watching the blue glow light up...adds some fun/reward to the daily routine.  As a user of anti bacterial gels I can&#x27;t understand why its taken so long to get a product like this.  It&#x27;s been very safe(no chemicals needed or hot steam)and easy to use.  I called the company about the bulb(concerned about replacements) and they told me the product and bulb has a 1 year warranty.  Works like a charm and feels great to have a clean toothbrush entering my mouth everyday.</li>
    <li> Item was not in working condition when it arrived.  Returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mother, who is a bonafide hypochondriac. She absolutely loves it and uses it 4 times per day. In 2 years of use, the original bulb is still working, She has not complained of any dental hygiene issues and has had no sore throats or laryngitis.</li>
    <li> Easy to take from the box and get started. Simple to use. Brush, shake off water and insert into the Sanitizer. Ten minutes of anti-bacterial blue light and you&#x27;re good to go for another brushing. Since I can&#x27;t see at the bacterial level, I am assuming the Violight is doing its work on the tooth and gum bacteria that inhabit the human mouth and consequently the tooth brush. Probably not a pretty picture but I feel confident now that this pleasant looking blue light is doing its proper duty in knocking off the creepy crawlies. Also, it&#x27;s easy to wash out the inner container as recommended on a weekly or so basis.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what they sa it is!</li>
    <li> Works Great - I mean I can&#x27;t actually hear the bacteria screaming in agony when I turn it ON, but I&#x27;d like to think they suffer and die within the 15 minutes it&#x27;s on, before it shuts off.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this product for about 3 years, and have never had a problem. We make sure to shake excess water off our electric toothbrushes, pop them in the sanitizer, and they&#x27;re ready for next use. Our bulb just burned out after use four times per day for three years (that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m on Amazon). We have not had any issues with mold or mildew growing in the product. I do clean the unit about once every two or three months - I just soak the drip cup and removable lid in a weak bleach solution. After beginning to use the product, we noticed a decrease in cold and flu transmission throughout the family. In addition, my husband&#x27;s gum health improved. I believe if you perform simple maintenance on the device, just like replacing your toothbrush or toothbrush head every six months, you will be thrilled with this product. It&#x27;s well worth it.  Update: After viewing the company&#x27;s website for replacement bulbs, I found out that if you wipe the battery contacts with rubbing alcohol, if the bulb is intact (very helpful diagram on co.&#x27;s website), the light will work again. So, I didn&#x27;t need a replacement bulb after all!</li>
    <li> this item was received in a timely manner.  We use it in our motorhome and it does an excellent job...highly recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> I was given this item as a gift about 10 years ago. I have used it almost every day since then. I love it. It&#x27;s easy to take apart to clean. It works great, keeps toothbrushes clean. This one does not have battery options like other similar ones but just plug it into the wall. Pros - Has worked great for years. (about 4-6 years and that might make it worth the price)   UV light works.   It cleans the brushes.   Don&#x27;t need to worry about germs accumulating over time.   Easy to take apart and clean. (about 4 parts)  Cons - On switch needs to be pressed hard to work.   Seems overpriced but competitors seem to be in the same price range for similar product.  EDIT: After about 10 years of service this product is STILL working! The switch finally fell off. Under that was the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; switch. It&#x27;s easier than ever to turn on now. The UV light still works. It turns right on and off in about 10-15 minutes. I will continue to use it until it quits. I am single so I can clean it less often, but I still clean it every 3-4 months. It&#x27;s rarely even dirty. The price for a new one seems high, but it lasts forever so it&#x27;s a good use of your money.  I really recommend this product. It has proven to sanitize my toothbrushes for years. I never get sick for any reason. I assume this product has helped in that good luck. I have good dental hygiene and this product contributes to that I believe. UV light does work to kill germs. It&#x27;s been proven and is now used in all kinds of applications. When I got this years ago I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything, but now UV has spread to all kinds of other uses to kill bacteria and germs. Well worth buying if it lasts as long as mine has.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Hard to get the light  to turn on.  Hard to clean.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a waste.  Not only are the other negative reviews correct, the poor design on this product had me immersing my toothbrush head into a pool of collected water at the bottom of this \\&quot;sanitizer\\&quot;.  This seems to be a well put together product because of its sleek and cool looking design.  However, as the saying goes, \\&quot;appearances can be decieving\\&quot;.  Aside from this, the disinfective qualities of this product are probably just as effective as letting a toothbrush naturally air dry.</li>
    <li> We have been sharing some viruses lately and they kept coming back. I bought this hoping it would help keep some of the germs away. So far so good. It is very easy to use and looks great on my sink.</li>
    <li> When I received the VIOlight, assembled it and turned it on, I thought the bulb was not working but I learned it takes a second or two for it to light up. I really like using it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and assemble. Stopped working after two weeks.</li>
    <li> Purchase in december, so far so good. It really is serving it purpose, works fine!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Being a dental hygienist I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the latest and greatest when it comes to my mouth.  So last year when I saw the Time Magazine article listing the Violight as one of the new hot inventions, I knew that is what I wanted for my christmas gift. I LOVE it! I put the entire family&#x27;s toothbrushes in it. It&#x27;s especially great when my 21month old daughter thinks it&#x27;s a great idea to borrow everyone else&#x27;s toothbrush. It is also very beneficial when someone in our family has a cold, who wants to brush their teeth with all the cold germs still stuck to the toothbrush? Now that I have it, I&#x27;ll never live without it! Thanks for the great invention!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this after using the travel model. It works perfectly. The Violight is based on sound scientific principles. I bought Violights for several of my adult children last year for Christmas. They love it, too. Now I no longer have to suffer from yeast infections in my mouth.</li>
    <li> This is a great product about $100 cheaper than steam sanitizers.  Works as stated and accepts electric toothbrush heads although they can sit a little low. Looks great on the counter.</li>
    <li> I got this item as a gift, and now I will make it a gift for others this Christmas. I am not a &#x27;clean-freak&#x27; by any means, but the idea of sanitizing my toothbrush made sense as soon as I started to think about it. The VIOlight worked with my Sonicare electric head, and it was so easy to use. I brush and use the VIOlight just like my old toothbrush holder. No extra steps.</li>
    <li> Item worked great for a couple of weeks, then quit working altogether. Very poor product.</li>
    <li> For anyone who wants the absolute in oral sanitization, this is the product for you.  It&#x27;s fast, thorough and so easy to use.  If you think this is some kind of gimmick, you should know that dentists use a similar method utilizing UV light to sterilize their tools.  This is much better than the G. Terminator.  I&#x27;ve had both.  After a few months the interior of the GT began to turn a nasty brown.  Then the plastic became brittle and cracked.  This was caused by the heat during the steam process.  To make matters worse, GT recommends using distilled water.  If you don&#x27;t use distilled water, you&#x27;ll get a cruddy build up of mineral deposits.  Yuck!  Distilled water?  That&#x27;s just one more cost and inconvenience.  The company insisted on a complicated return procedure where I paid the shipping costs.  With the Violight there is no heat, just UV light.  The Customer Service department at Violight is also first rate.  They provide prompt, courteous responses to any questions one might have.  Buy this product now.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This is better then I had hoped ,my husband actually liked it and uses it every time.finally a gift that is used and not stuffed away in the closet.It is compact and fits nicely on our vanity.</li>
    <li> Easy to use does the job simply. No negatives.  Tip :its best to put your toothbrush in before you are going to use it rather than right after you use it, when its already dry so as not to get gunk in the sanitizer :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy. The product died after 5 months. When you press button, nothing happens. It is power-operated, not battery-operated. Checked power cord, outlet etc. all were fine. Product did not turn on.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working fine.  It is easy to use and handy on the vanity.  Unfortunately you cannot really tell if it is doing its job, but we are assuming it is as the brushes stay very clean.</li>
    <li> Good size and good design.  Fits all tooth brushes which is nice in these days of larger and larger handles. I feel much better knowing the toothbrushes are sanitized.  Do wish it had a top.  We use it in the motorhome and I put it under the counter down the road and I would feel better with a top.  I use foil now.</li>
    <li> Have had one for year and it has fallen on marble floor several times and it has never broken.  just got one for my husband&#x27;s bathroom.  Tip:  turn the brush around so that the sides face the light occasionally. This product is essential for everyone.  I also purchased a sterilizer for my mouth&lt;br /&gt;appliance that I wear when I sleep.</li>
    <li> Received item promptly but it didn&#x27;t work and had to be returned. I am still waiting for refund.</li>
    <li> This review is specific to this seller, AsSeenonTVGuys. I&#x27;ve purchased from a number of Amazon merchants without a problem. That wasn&#x27;t the case with AsSeenonTVGuys. The product was poorly packed and stopped working after a few weeks. I emailed them about an exchange and they directed me to the Violight customer since it&#x27;s under warranty. There&#x27;s nothing explicitly wrong with this--I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s all spelled out in their policies. But is is a far cry from other Amazon marketplace experiences I&#x27;ve had. If you plan to buy from them, make sure you&#x27;ve read their fine print and are comfortable with it *before* you purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Vio light product I have recently purchased. ALL have failed within days of receipt. This one wouldn&#x27;t work straight out of the box. Violight has sever quality issues....dont buy, isn&#x27;t worth the exchange/return hassles.</li>
    <li> First about air drying.  The only thing about air drying I don&#x27;t like is that in a bathroom there are lots of germs stirred up by family members sneezing and coughing at certain times of the year.  And even flushing the toilet sends a certain amount of bacteria into the air according to the experts on TV.     So I kept my brush hidden in the drawer the last 5 years, that was a big mistake, it only takes about 2 weeks to colonized with bacteria.  I was getting these gingivitis like gum infections.  For a few years I thought the bacteria was coming from my stomach, but after doing some research, I bought one of these and my gum problem went away.  I will always have some type of sterilizer, they are too cheap not to when you consider the brush goes into your mouth.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to comment on this company&#x27;s customer service unit. They are horrible. They wasted a lot of my time, which could easily have been avoided by asking me one simple question during the first of several phone calls.     In addition, one representative basically was lying to me until I read the text directly from the VIOLIGHT website.</li>
    <li> The item worked perfectly for about 2 weeks.  I have purchased 3 of these in the past (one was a gift) and I really like them. This one is defective.</li>
    <li> Finally a toothbrush sanitizer that works and is easy to use.  I would suggest this one to anyone that wants to feel confident that they are doing the most they can to protect and clean there teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Product stopped working within months. Tried to get a replacement but was told that since I bought it through their store-front on Amazon there was no &amp;#34;receipt&amp;#34; even though I sent them my invoice with the date purchased, price, and payment info. Never dealing with them again.</li>
    <li> Ok so the quality of the product is nice, and it looks very nice. Ive been using it for awhile now and all was well. But I don&#x27;t think it kills any germs. I wish i had a microscope to be sure. But I recently got sick after using my toothbrush one night. and I even push the button twice after and before every brush. because you press it once and it stays on for about 8mins. but after it turns off I press it again for another 8mins just to be safe. and i still wasn&#x27;t safe. So idk about the uv light technology. It probably kills some germs. But obviously not enough to keep from getting sick. Also I do not keep my brushes in the bathroom. I also don&#x27;t have any immune system problems. So back to the cup of alcohol and peroxide. which as always worked very very well for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: yes so after about 4 weeks of using this product I ended up gettin sick. and I think it was because of my toothbrush because I smelled it and it smelled really bad. I threw it out and eventually got better. My tonsils were swollen.</li>
    <li> Our first VioLight lasted over 6 years... the 2nd and 3rd ones, just under 18 months each. Customer service was atrocious, taking forever to respond and then doing so with answers that had nothing to do with my question/inquiry.  At one point, they wanted me to ship the dead unit back at my expense to be &amp;#34;tested&amp;#34;,then a couple days later someone else answered the SAME email and told me it was out of warranty.  Quality has definitely gone down and customer serviced is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When  narrowed down the problem to a defective (new) replacement bulb they refused to replace the bulb without a proof of purchase.  Penny wise and ound foolish to lose a loyal customer over a $10 (retail) item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced my unit again but will not buy another when this one dies.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I thought the on/off switch had stopped working after a long period of being flaky and sometimes working, sometimes not, but then I unscrewed and re-screwed the lightbulb in, and suddenly everything worked perfectly. The lightbulb is unprotected and it&#x27;s easy to knock into it (and I guess loosen it) as you insert a toothbrush, and you wouldn&#x27;t want to throw in a dripping wet toothbrush with the socket so close, but if you&#x27;re common-sense careful, it&#x27;s not a problem. I&#x27;ve used it once a week for years. It fits various shapes of toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> The only thing I can see is that the Tooth Brush unit needs is a plastic Top to cover the tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You..... Loreena</li>
    <li> bulb burned out in a very short time. Would not recommend this idem.</li>
    <li> this is the second VIOlight I&#x27;ve had.  the first one was a gift.  I broke one of the little coils that the battery needed to connect, so I just bought this one.  It is great.</li>
    <li> Very convienent and easy to use.  I have another one that has lasted more than 2 years.  I is a bugger to clean though.</li>
    <li> Bought this product here in Amazon a few months ago thinking that it can sanitize toothbrushes. Though there is no proven effect, I got enamored by the idea of UV light keeping the toothbrush heads clean. It was a pretty thing to be seen in the bathroom especially when the bluelight is on but it&#x27;s not really as sturdy as compared to a regular toothbrush holder. The holding cups are difficult to clean and since it pools fluid from wet heads, I don&#x27;t see how UV light can keep the heads sanitized. And since it is stored in the bathroom, it gets moist most of the time from the steam of the hot water. It was already broken after 3 months of use. It was really a waste of $45.</li>
    <li> Who would actually think such a gizmo is even useful if it DID do what it claims?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Anything that gets on your toothbrush head was ALREADY in your mouth. Unless you think your houseguests are cleaning their shoe soles with your toothbrush while you aren&#x27;t looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) You are sitting a wet toothbrush head upside down in this gizmo. Which means it is sitting in a puddle of water that is likely to mold/mildew. So you can put mold/mildew INTO your mouth (that was NOT in your mouth before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The puddle of water is likely to (a) rust out the innards of this gizmo and (b) short-circuit the gizmo&#x27;s electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) The American Dental Association says these gizmos have no proven beneficial health benefits:&lt;br /&gt;  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting \\&quot;Hard 8\\&quot; at the Craps table in Vegas.</li>
    <li> UV toothbrush sanitizer only works on surfaces exposed to the light. If you cut the toothbrush head in half, you&#x27;ll see the light does not kill anything hiding inside the mechanical head. The toothbrush must be submersed in a Listerene type product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t exactly know how well this product is working, but it gives my boyfriend and I piece of mind that our toothbrushes are sanitary and clean. There is nothing more disgusting than thinking about the possible contamination and germs that could be on your toothbrush, and this product helps. I like that the bristles of the brush are inside of the VIOlight and it is at least covered at all times. Just make sure to regularly take apart the holder and clean it with hot water and soap because left over toothpaste can (obviously) begin to build after you brush.</li>
    <li> The idea of this is the ultra-violet light disinfects your toothbrush as they dry.  The holding part is a bit flimsy.  After a couple months, it stopped working.  I assumed the buld burnt out, which seemed premature.  I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement bulb at the home stores, so we ordered a replacement online.  It&#x27;s not the bulb.  This wasn&#x27;t inexpensive, but lasted like something that was.</li>
    <li> The concept is great and for the first day it worked well for our family.  It was only after a couple of days that I realized that sharing the device with my kids was not a great idea.  My kids rarely rinse their brushes after brushing and rarely give the brushes a good shaking to eliminate the excess water before inserting the toothbrush into the device causing a myriad of issues with the product not to mention the communal gunk that builds up in the holding tray after only a few days.  I had to clean the device out twice a day to keep the germs out and the kids healthy.  I&#x27;ve decided to trash this device and purchase separate sanitizers for each family member.  I know this won&#x27;t cure the problem of teaching my kids to rinse and shake their brushes before inserting into the sanitizer but it will definitely eliminate the complaints that &amp;#34;we are sharing still sharing germs mom.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> this is our third one, we keep wearing them out!  great for making sure your toothbrush is really really clean</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and use.  Psychologically I feel better and hope it is sanitizing as advertised.  Not bad to look at either and love the light.</li>
    <li> I ruined the first one trying to clean inside and water got on microchip.  I will dry clean this one, but obviously we like it, because we bought the exact same one again!</li>
    <li> This is our second sanitizer and storage system. Our first was lasted a very long time before dying. These are a must have item for every household. Germs are plentiful and this system will help eliminate them.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Violight half a dozen times over the past few years.  It was hard to fit one of my toothbrushes in the hole, and I was always cleaning the unit.  Sometimes I&#x27;d get a burned smell from my toothbrush, and when I opened the Violight there would be black charring on the plastic inside.  I also noticed that, despite us shaking off our toothbrushes religiously, water was pooling (and smelled foul) in the bottom of the unit.  One reviewer mentioned she was getting sick from having her toothbrush upside down in water, and I believe her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked around and settled on the Multiple Toothbrush &amp; Razor UV Sanitizer Wall Mounted, here at Amazon.  It wall mounts with either sticky tape or screws (they give you both), has a sidecar for toothpaste (we didn&#x27;t attach ours), the toothbrushes easily hang head up so they stay dry, there&#x27;s room for a razor (I don&#x27;t use that, either), and the whole thing looks nice (just a rectangular blue on the wall).  I wish I&#x27;d know about this product before I ever paid more money and bought my first Violight.</li>
    <li> great experience, great product. Very easy ordering through amazon.com; i would highly reccomend it!! I have no complaints and will continue to purchase this product and smilar products; This product simply akes my teeth feel more cleen because i know i am coming home to a clean toothbrush after each use</li>
    <li> Was satisfied enough with the first one to order another when it quit working. Deducted one star for limited life span (lasted almost three years)</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT WORKS WELL</li>
    <li> I have had this product for many years and it finally gave out, so I am buying my second one.  I have read other reviews of the product.  I certainly don&#x27;t know if it really sanitizes the toothbrushes or not, however I feel that there are no proven products out there and hopefully this is effective.  It is a nice looking toothbrush holder and I have been satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Today after 2 years of ownership, we threw our violight in the trash. Ours was given to us as a gift and we did use it, but it definitely has more drawbacks than it should. First, as noted in other reviews, there is no real evidence that this thing prevents disease any better than air drying your toothbrush. Second, if you need to replace the light bulb, you&#x27;ll find it to be very expensive, around $15 at least. Third, even though you use the disinfecting light on a daily basis, the inside of this thing still gets cruddy and in my opinion it is difficult to clean. Fourth, the AC cord has a transformer on it that takes up lots of space on your outlet. With razors, curling irons, hair dryers, and other gadgets competing for your bathroom outlet, you&#x27;ll find it irritating that this thing takes up one of your receptacles. In my opinion, storing your toothbrush \\&quot;the old fashioned way,\\&quot; in a cup or in a toothbrush holder, with the bristles up, is still the best way to go. After owning one for two years, I would recommend that you spend your hard-earned money on something else.</li>
    <li> Holds my toothbrushes while giving me peace of mind.  Does it kill germs?  Don&#x27;t really care, its the best way to protect my brushes from toilet particles floating in the bathroom and give me peace of mind.</li>
    <li> I am planning on returning.  Although I might not have read the description correctly, when we received we just wrapped and give as a Christmas gift and THEN discovered it was electric not battery operated as the individual Tootbrush Sanitizer are.  I hope to find the receipt and return.&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea of the product, but it does not work in our bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Would appreciate copy of purchase receipt if possible.</li>
    <li> It seemed like a good idea.  wish i&#x27;d saved my money.  Within 2 weeks, the holder had black mold or mildew in it. We live in Dallas - it&#x27;s certainly not from ambient humidity.  it comes apart and the little cup comes out for cleaning, but you can&#x27;t clean this out.  not even a bottlebrush gets into the crevices.</li>
    <li> I purchased my VIOLight the beginning of December and it is already not working properly.  It will turn on but does not turn off on its own (which it is supposed to do).  As a result of it not turning off the power supply cord gets very hot (fire hazard) and I have to unplug the unit to turn it off.[[ASIN:B001LFGDI6 VIOlight Countertop 4 Brush UV Toothbrush Sanitizer]]</li>
    <li> Love it use it daily gave one in each bathroom</li>
    <li> My Chinese friend used it the first time in China, then the plug burned, and smokes. It doesn&#x27;t work now. Will the seller give me some explanations and suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t scientifically prove this works, but, keeping in mind that barbers have been using ultaviolet light to sterilize tools they use for decades, and it&#x27;s also used in the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;food service industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed one review where the reviewer mentioned that there were germs remaining&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after being removed from the unit. That reviewer may not be aware of the fact that you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t necessarilly have to wipe out the germs, just lower the count to the point that they can&#x27;t colonize a host. Thereby giving you the result you want---illness are not passed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had this unit a year now, and we have not had any instances of a cold or fever producing illness lingering longer then the usual coarse for an illness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This saves us having to throw out tooth brushes after an illness, and in fact allows us to keep brushing during and after the illness without worrying or wasting money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wifes a physician, and I&#x27;m an ER RN and we both love having this unit.</li>
    <li> I never thought about sanitizing our toothbrushes until I saw  &lt;br /&gt;the Violight in my dentists office. &lt;br /&gt;The dental hygienist highly  recommended the Violight as a way to easily &lt;br /&gt;store and sanitize our families toothbrushes. &lt;br /&gt;We have been using it for several months and are very satisfied. &lt;br /&gt;A big benefit is that the blue glow encourages the kids to brush.</li>
    <li> Used this brand for years.  I presume it is sanitizing.</li>
    <li> Love this Toothbrush Sanitizer. Easy to use and easy to take apart and clean.</li>
    <li> I have had this for several years.  I replaced the light and bought a new sanitizer also. I know that when we brush our teeth we are not putting germs back into our mouths.</li>
    <li> My wife found this product at a liquidation store for less than $10 around 3yrs ago. She got one for me and one for our adult daughter. Both are still working however one developed a balky switch after a couple of years so that it takes several pushes of the button to activate the device. The two star rating was based on the overall quality at the Amazon price. This is a perfectly acceptable device at $10 but at $50 I would be very disappointed in the build quality. I will leave the debate over efficacy to others.</li>
    <li> We used this for about a year before we became really tired of cleaning it every week. Tried the dishwasher and I think that was a no-no since most of the reflective coating on the inside came off!</li>
    <li> this is the 2nd purchase.  the last one survived for about 8 yrs.  I have a portable one that travels with me also.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was the 1st one was DOA.  It was replaced promptly!!  2 days after i got a response back.  good job.  service is very important.  :-)</li>
    <li> We have had a Violight for many years and it quit working, so we got another!  We have had fewer colds and sickness since we first started using the first one.</li>
    <li> This is our second unit (I dropped the other one and it broke) All I know is our dental exams have gotten much better since we got this product over a year ago.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I returned the first one I got for a product replacement... the second one failed after 1 week of use! Same thing as the first... I dont know if the switch is defective or the bulb lasts for a week (at $11 a pop)... DO NOT purchase this product until they fix the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was a great idea and the technology seemed standard as I have seen many more like-products on the market. I bought it for my wife so she would stop going through rubbing alchohol to cleanse our toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was easy to set up, but the rubber button that starts the &#x27;decontamination&#x27; cycle seemed doomed from the moment my wife attempted to use daily. The button was difficult to push as it took force to get it to click on; and you couldnt just push it with our using two hands to hold it in place (the entire unit is so light that you cant just push the button with one hand without pushing it over or all around the sink area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part was: IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER 2 WEEKS! The bulb looks fine as the filament is unbroken and is not discolored... even if it was the bulb, who would get something where the EXPENSIVE and PROPRIATARY bulbs go out after daily use (once a day decon) for 2 weeks?! So, it must be the unit itself that is defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wasnt a fan of all the water and toothpaste residue collecting in the difficult-to-access-and-clean water tray that is supposed to assist with cleanliness (the major point of this contraption). I get it, we are supposed to bang-out all the excess water... we tried, but I have a 3 and 8 yr old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea of this toothbrush cleaner, the engineers havent got it right yet. Go back to the drawing board and try harder... use one in your own bathroom first! I love how it is called a &#x27;storage&#x27; system... it is a good way to store toothbrushes, but only if the disinfect part works correctly, otherwise, you may just want to swish it around the toilet first.</li>
    <li> When it works, it&#x27;s great. Then there are days when it won&#x27;t turn on for no apparent reason. Have no idea if it&#x27;s really sanitizing anything although the blue glow makes me feel like it might!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave feedbacks, but I felt this needed one. I had one for over 5 years with no problems at all.  The only reason why I bought a new one was bulb needed to be replaced (even if bulb still glows need to change at least in a year).  The light by itself was 11.95 and cup to put toothbrushes in was 9.95 plus shipping and handling. Only place I could find replacements were Violight.  Because we wanted to get new cups and light, we decided to get a new one and have warranty again.  I have had no problem with button as others have stated. Since I have got my new one, I haven&#x27;t got sick so I feel it really does help kill germs.  This is a awesome product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my second Violife Toothbrush Sanitizer. My first unit lasted me quite a few years and I got my moneys&#x27; worth out of it. I made my initial purchase after seeing the item on the Rachel Ray show.  They actually had toothbrushes sent to a lab to be analyzed.  The toothbrush that was kept in a cup on the bathroom counter was full of germs and bacteria.  The toothbrush that was in the Violife was completely free of germs and bacteria. I truly believe that since using the sanitizer my family has had less colds.  I also like it because I keep my toothbrushes on my bathroom counter also and with them encased in the Violife, I know they are safe from any nasty germs thrown up into the air when the toilet is flushed.  I would have given this 5 stars but for the fact that my last Violife also could be run on batteries and I preferred that to having to plug in. I have to address the reviews that mention mold in the unit.  If you read the directions it tells you to get any excess water off of the toothbrush before putting it into the unit.  As with anything you have to clean it out.  Once a week I remove the cup and clean it with a watered down bleach solution. Its a simple trade-off for the peace of mind.</li>
    <li> This is the best product you can buy</li>
    <li> Excellent product! This was a replacement for same product that was about ten years old.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always interesting when you come across a product you&#x27;re considering and find that reviewers have had such polar opposite experiences with the product in question.  There&#x27;s always bound to be some negative reviews of any given product and I think we&#x27;ve all learned to take that in stride.  But, it would be dishonest of me if I said that I hadn&#x27;t changed my mind about purchasing some products based on even just a few negative reviews.  In the case of this toothbrush sanitizer there are clearly enough negative reviews to give me pause.  Fortunately for me, my Violife was a gift (from an orthodontist no less) so I never read all of the reviews here that most likely would have swayed me away from this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend no disrespect to other reviewers who have described their experiences with mildew and mold growing in this unit, but when I read their reviews and contrast those with my own experience using this product I am left wondering if they aren&#x27;t perhaps blaming the product when their use habits are more likely responsible for the problem?  I can imagine that if one were to regularly put a dripping wet toothbrush in this Violife, or one that hadn&#x27;t been rinsed thoroughly even, the build up of \\&quot;toothpaste scum\\&quot; is going to be a natural result.  Over time having a pool of this scum on the bottom of the sanitizer or any surface will likely promote the growth of mold/mildew.  It sounds to me like they are using this sanitizing device as perhaps their toothbrush holder and not only as an appliance to sanitize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t necessarily their fault if they are using this sanitizer as a toothbrush storage device as the listing title here on Amazon specifically calls out that use.  However, when looking over the manufacturer&#x27;s web site I don&#x27;t find any mention made of this product being recommended for toothbrush storage.  Rather, the manufacturer&#x27;s site lists this product as a \\&quot;Countertop UV Sanitizer\\&quot;.  The negative reviews here may be a result of a misleading, albeit unintentional, product description that created this expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a separate, old-fashioned non-mechanical toothbrush holder that looks very much like the one Amazon has for sale here - [[ASIN:B000JJ7MQW InterDesign York Toothbrush Stand, White/Chrome]].  I use this toothbrush holder stand as the place where my toothbrush dries out between uses and I don&#x27;t put a wet toothbrush into my Violife.  If anyone reading this review has used a similar style toothbrush holder to the one shown on the link I inserted above, they know that these get dirty over time with toothpaste scum building up on the lower tray and droplets creating a residue on the stainless steel upper ring.  It&#x27;s just bound to happen no matter how one chooses to store a toothbrush when not in use.  I&#x27;m sure that for those who lay their toothbrushes flat in a drawer organizer, they too find the telltale signs of toothpaste residue over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean my toothbrush stand at least weekly and typically more often than that.  If I were going to be using the Violife for this purpose I would be cleaning it at least that often.  Perhaps some users feel that because the ultraviolet light cleans their toothbrush heads, it is somehow going to also clean the unit itself?  I can&#x27;t say, but it doesn&#x27;t seem logical by my way of thinking to expect this product to behave any different than a good old fashioned toothbrush stand if being used in the same capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the unit itself, I have had mine for about four years now and only have had one problem to report.  When I first tried the unit after unpacking it the bulb didn&#x27;t work.  I contacted the company and they quickly sent me out a replacement bulb.  Since then, no issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some of the others who have reviewed this product, I can&#x27;t say with 100% certainty that regular use has cut down on the number of times I caught cold or otherwise make any health claims.  It just makes senseto me that a product of this nature can reduce the chance of catching a bug or allowing viruses to spread from one family member to another through cross contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the product and glad to have it.  I hope that this is helpful to someone who is on the fence about this purchase.he chance of catching a bug or allowing viruses to spread from one family member to another through cross contamination.

    <li> The light comes on so I suppose it is doing what it says it will do.  I like it!  Good.</li>
    <li> I have been using The VIOlight toothbrush sanitizer for about 5 years now.  This is my second one.  I dropped the first one and broke it so there is no telling how long it would have lasted if I had not been so clumsy.  I had it taped together for a while after it broke but finally decided to just get a new one.  I like the idea of having a clean sanitized toothbrush and this little appliance does the job.  The light bulb lasts quite a while, I want to say a couple of  years or more.  When it finally burns out you can just order another one here on Amazon for a reasonable price.  The sanitizer does not take up much space on the countertop.  About the size of a glass.  It holds 4 toothbrushes and even came with adapters for electronic brushheads. I would recommend you open it up and clean out the inside cup about once a week if you like. I woud highly recommend this product and if I ever need to buy another one it will most likely be this same model unless they come out with something better...all in all I&#x27;m totally satisfied!.</li>
    <li> light bulb went out shortly after getting. I was not impressed with experience.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with the impression that an inverted toothbrush holder (bristles stored upside down)would be o.k. since the ultraviolet lights would keep the bristles and the machine sanitary.  Granted the instructions state that you need to periodically clean the tray.  Little did I know that due to design flaws, mildew builds up in the tiny crevices in the lid!  How is this possible if the device was truly sanitizing my toothbrush?!  There is no detectable mildew on the toothbrush, but the black muck certainly is visible in the crevices.  I think I will check out an upright santitizer - one that will prop the bristles vertically upward, vice downward (like this device).</li>
    <li> I have read some information about toothbrush sanitizers and decided it would be a good thing to use.  I know people that have had heart disease because of gum bacteria, the damage has caused many medical problems.  I myself have gone through radiation treatment that has effected my mouth and teeth and I decided it might be benificial to me to take some extra precautions to keep my mouth as germ free as possible.  The product is easy to use.  I can&#x27;t compare the quality or workmanship at this time because I have nothing to compare to it.  I feel strong enough about the possibility of this being positive though, that I also purchased a second one for another family.&lt;br /&gt;Bea</li>
    <li> I purchased the travel VIOlight case for use with my Oral-B power toothbrush head.  I don&#x27;t know anything about UV light killing bacteria, so I can&#x27;t say whether the VIOlight will actually decrease my likelihood of getting sick.  That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5-stars - that part of it hasn&#x27;t been proven to me yet.  However at the very least it does give me peace of mind that it is in a protected case in the bathroom, so I no longer have that little voice in the back of my head going \\&quot;ewwww\\&quot; when I flush the toilet!  Plus when I travel, I won&#x27;t have to worry if I packed it up when it was still wet.  Now I can put it away AND still have it get cleaned.  I can&#x27;t comment on the travel VIOlight&#x27;s drip tray yet since I&#x27;ve only used my VIOlight once and haven&#x27;t tried to remove the drip tray.  My Oral-B power toothbrush head fit into the travel case just fine.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a Christmas gift and all I can say is that  it arrived in a timely manner and was as depicted in the photo.  I hope that our daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Violight Zapi for a couple of years and have found I no longer have lingering colds since it kills the germs on my toothbrush.  I did find I was using a lot of batteries in the Zapi, so invested in this unit with it&#x27;s adaptor. It works well and I will continue to enjoy no colds.</li>
    <li> Love the idea of this it didn&#x27;t work right from the start (you would have to push the button three or four times to get the light to work, some days it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all) and then after a year it completely stopped working.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to a product that sanitized toothbrushes. It was broken when it arrived. The bulb did not turn on, there was no blue glow. Perhaps the bulb was broken. The product appeared to be well made and had a sleek design that I liked. It would have fit in nicely with the bathroom decor. I did not contact the seller and let them know the product was defective. I threw it away. I like the idea of sanitizing your toothbrush. Was disappointed that it did not work.</li>
    <li> This does a great job of sanitizing our toothbrushes.  I also leave my travel one in here until I get ready to leave.&lt;br /&gt;It fits Oral B brushes just fine.</li>
    <li> The light bulb was advertised to last for 18 months fell far short of that target...only lasted for 6 months. We use daily...very disappointed:-(</li>
    <li> still just trying this out... we&#x27;ll see how we like it.</li>
    <li> I had a battery operated one before and could place it anywhere this one I can&#x27;t move around as much because of plug. Still is a good product</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a great thing to do sanitize toothbrushes,I will tell my friends .  This brand was the one I liked,it is working</li>
    <li> I do like this product. I bought this from amazon as a replacement for one that I had for about 6.5 years. My old one lasted that long since I&#x27;m single. The light bulb stopped working on my old one, and I figured I&#x27;d buy a new unit as opposed to just replacing the bulb, because the on switch gets a lot use over the years. That being said, I do like this product. I have fewer colds after having used it. You do have to regularly clean the plastic top and the cup in the bottom, or else build up will occur. Don&#x27;t pay much attention to the negative reviews about the fact that they have build up in the bottom cup. They apparently don&#x27;t clean it out like the directions say. My one complaint with the unit I just got received is that I seem to missing some viopegs or got some wrong ones. The viopegs are small plastic inserts to hold your toothbrush at a higher level, specifically to be used for brush heads for electric toothbrushes. My old one came with 4 of them. But this one came with two correctly sized viopegs, and two larger ones. The two larger ones are too tall and would hold the brush at a much higher level and not get the benefit of the UV light. Not sure if that was a mistake or was intentional. I know with my old unit, that it had four of the correct size viopegs. I will simply reuse two of those for use with my new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, kudos to amazon for getting this to me so fast! I&#x27;m an amazon prime member, ordered it early on a Friday morning. The estimated arrival date was Tuesday, but amazingly I got it here the next day, Saturday morning.</li>
    <li> This is our second one. We used the first one for many years until it gave up. Have reduced the number of colds we have had since using this. Oh don&#x27;t forget your flu shot.</li>
    <li> I choose this product because I previously own a sanitizer and need another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the  produce because of fhe purpose it served.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I feel better knowing that my kids brushes are being sanitized after brushing.</li>
    <li> My mom had one like this last year but it died and I couldn&#x27;t find another one. So of course I went on Amazon and I found it but i didn&#x27;t get the battery one I got the one that plugs in. It sanitizing the toothbrush and its just wonderful</li>
    <li> I chose this product because we use multiple brushes in a day with various head styles. It accommodates all of the brushes!  And since it cleans multiple brushes at the same time we just turn it on at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t used it for electric brush heads ( which are shorter) but it does come with an adapter.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get my violight countertop sanitizer because I&#x27;ve owned their travel sanitizer for a few months and it works great! However, when I plugged in my countertop sanitizer I found out that it didn&#x27;t shut off automatically like it says it will on the description. I had to press the start button to manually turn it off. The unit got really hot when I accidentally left it on for &gt;30 min as well. I contacted violight customer service about this issue and they responded immediately, communicated well, and delivered a replacement unit to me within days. The replacement unit doesn&#x27;t seem to have any issues yet, so I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I specifically bought this product because this is the only unit produced by Violight that can be plugged in... all of their other UV toothbrush devices run on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars is that the price is steep. I hope that it will last for at least 2 years, and at least I have some spare parts from my first defective sanitizer (UV light, plastic parts) that I can use... but most customers won&#x27;t have issues when the product is under warranty so it&#x27;s pretty expensive to purchase replacement parts. I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend paying MSRP for this. I purchased my first unit from Sharper Image with the Living Social deal. I did something similar with my travel sanitizer at Brookstone via a GroupOn deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m guessing I just got a defective unit but it stopped working after the first two to three months. I thought it was the bulb but even after replacing it the unit still does not work.</li>
    <li> Great idea, quality and consistency of turning on totally erratic.</li>
    <li> This started out great. However, ours stopped working about a month after purchasing this. I like the concept. You&#x27;ll have to clean it often. However, perhaps there are others that have better experiences with this product.</li>
    <li> We just bought our 2nd VIOlight tootbrush sanitizer, after the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button on the previous one disintegrated.  Up to this point, we thought it worked very well.  But if you use an electric toothbrush, you might want to avoid this sanitizer, as it&#x27;s now sent with 2 different sizes of \\&quot;VIOpegs\\&quot; (to hold the shorter brushes up) -- only 2 of each size.  The 2 longer pegs seem to work only with very short, round brushes.  Our Sonicare heads don&#x27;t work with the 2 longer pegs, but when we called the company, they said that was it -- they wouldn&#x27;t/couldn&#x27;t send 2 more of the shorter pegs.  So we&#x27;re left to use no pegs for at least 2 of our heads, but then the toothbrush heads fall so far into the top of the sanitizer that they&#x27;re hard to get out.  All in all, this model doesn&#x27;t work well for electric toothbrush heads such as Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Broken in a few months. Not worth my money spent.</li>
    <li> I really love the idea of this product, but I have purchased 2 them so far and they have stopped working after a short while. I am also concerned with the mold/mildew that grows at the bottom of the holding devise. I wanted to purchase another in hopes that my experiences were just a fluke, but several of the reviews mirror my experience.  I would be very interested in a product like this that works properly.</li>
    <li> I had been through two units which were operated by battery, and prefer this that plugs in. I am anxious to see how long it goes with the bulb. I am sure it will burn out at some point. I am thankful to have a plug at a convenient location in my bathroom.</li>
