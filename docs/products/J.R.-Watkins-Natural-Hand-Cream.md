<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE the texture, smell and it lasts.  I use it on hands and feet before bed.</li>
    <li> Great Product and speedy delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the lemon body cream! It&#x27;s so thick and luxurious, it&#x27;s like rubbing lemon frosting all over yourself. What&#x27;s not great about that??? The sweet lemon scent is strong, but wonderful. It makes me feel happy like a lemon meringue pie.</li>
    <li> Smells like lemon cookies!!! It&#x27;s not at all overwhelming - but smells delicious. Keeps my hands smooth - not greasy. I keep one next to the dish soap - and use it after washing dishes every time. Another lives in the powder room - several times guests have come out of the powder room happily holding their hands up to take in the scent and often reporting a few days later that they&#x27;ve ordered some too.</li>
    <li> OMG!  This my new favorite hand cream!  I had terrible, ragged,red,  sore cuticles.  After using this cream for two days, my cuticles are getting smooth, they are no longer sore and the redness and raggedness have abated.  Have I mentioned it smells like lemon cake?  And not that artifical cake, it smells like real cake.  I love it.  And the price is great!  I highly suggest this to anyone as an intensive repair cream or as daily maintenance.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a must to have in the cold weather because my hands are so dry all the time.  I love the smell of this.  Smells like a delicious lemon cream pie which I can&#x27;t eat but love to smell it.  Keep it right by me on my computer table that I never leave anymore...lol</li>
    <li> Best hand cream . great scent. Bought more!</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling product ever</li>
    <li> Love, love anything lemon.</li>
    <li> This cream smells good at first, but when the lemon scent goes away it leaves the smell of AquaNet hairspray.  30 minutes later my hands look no more hydrated than before I used it.  Bummer for the price plus shipping (it&#x27;s not eligible for free shipping)</li>
    <li> I have this in a jar, 4/6 oz and haven&#x27;t run across it anywhere but online and it&#x27;s the number product I have to have. Not only for the luxuriousness of the cream, but the smell. Unlike any lemon fragrance, yummy is the only way to describe it.</li>
    <li> Best smelling lotion my wife had ever used!  If you like the smell of lemon cookies, get this stuff!</li>
    <li> Best hand lotion. Thick and creamy and smells like a lemon poppy seed muffin. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that really moisturizes my hands.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. just has a smell like lemon cookie doug. Takes a while to soak into the skin, it will do.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my hair, and it works perfectly!!!  This is the only thick, lemon-scented, nontoxic, shea butter-beased cream I can find on the American market.  If you have dry hair, esp. long hair, get this--it&#x27;s a true life-saver!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I wash my hands a lot in my field of work and this hand cream always helps my dry and cracked skin that starts to show up after my shifts!  I love the smell too!</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream on the market as far as i am concerned,even if it&#x27;s a little expensive,a little goes a long way and the scent-wow,just enough lemon and vanilla to make you hungry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many products over the years for dry skin around my fingernails and the tips of my fingers and this product works extremely well with just a small amount.</li>
    <li> I love the way that this product smells, but most of all, I love the way that it feels. It goes on nice and thick, and is great to use at bedtime. I wake up with nice soft hands, every time.</li>
    <li> I get lots of love when I use this cream and I does wonders for my over worked hands. I might end up gaining a few punds from the cravings it gives me but it is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is healing, non-greasy and smells awesome.  Wish I could find it locally - but this is a good price.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is absolutely divine. It is very moisturizing and smells like lemon meringue pie. The smell is not as concentrated once its on your hands, so it is not overpowering at all. This is my favorite hand cream!</li>
    <li> It has a great aroma, I feel that it moisturizes and repairs.</li>
    <li> The smells SO SO GOOD!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cream. Wish I could buy a vat of it.</li>
    <li> this lemon hand cream is really good. it&#x27;s a thick and scented with a true lemon scent. very creamy and long lasting. makes your skin feel soft and smell nice at the same time. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I work on an airplane and need a moisturizing hand lotion that isn&#x27;t too greasy and this is definitely the best! It&#x27;s also paraben free which is the reason I keep buying it. It smells like lemon meringue pie...yum!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous moisturizer and smells like fresh baked lemon cake. I love to use this hand cream. I have also used the lotion.</li>
    <li> My very, very favorite hand lotion.  Great size to keep in your purse.  It really softens dry hands.  And the lemon cream scent is amazing!  This makes a really nice gift too.</li>
    <li> Very high quality hand cream.  Makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> Others have noted that the lemony smell is quite strong.  I want to re-emphasize that.  The smell does fade after a couple of hours, but I had to put socks on my feet and stick them under the covers before I could sleep.  The smell was that strong.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice product that seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Works great as a moisturizer. But use sparingly, will leave you greasy. Smells WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Smells so good but doesn&#x27;t overwhelm. Very effective moisturizer. I have given it to friends and family and they also have become loyal users.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The smell is divine not too strong , not too sweet and not too citusy :) I love it and best of all it is all natural and contains shea butter , I love the smell which is like lemon pie cream .. however this is a light moisturizer .. I dont find shea butter in general to be very moisturizing compared to other creams / oils so if you need a divine smelling light hand moisturizer this is it if you need a strong one for very harsh hands try sthng else..I use night creams that i usually use for my face when my hands or feets ger really dry ..</li>
    <li> Very good smells great and high quality.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell and the feel of this cream. It actually made me crave lemon poppy seed cake.</li>
    <li> Hands down... The best hand cream! Feels great, non greasy formula, and it smells wonderful. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Like the fresh lemon smell and works well on the hands</li>
    <li> This hand cream is excellent! It smells amazing and moisturizes VERY well. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, which I love. I&#x27;m a cashier so I tend to be a little heavy handed with hand sanitizer, which dries out my hands, but after buying this my hands are back to life and not dry at all. VERY pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Favorite lotion! Absorbs quickly &amp; leaves my hands feeling so soft</li>
    <li> J. R. WATKINS HAND CREAM IS MY FAVORITE AND THE CREME POUR LE MAINS WITH SHEA BUTTER IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SCENT.  i SMELL LIKE LEMON CUSTARD ALL DAY LONG.</li>
    <li> Smells great at first application, after awhile tends to smell like furniture polish. Goes on smooth and leaves hands feeling soft.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand cream; it is cruelty free, ecological, smells great, and super-moisturizing without being overly sticky. The only downfall is that it smells so much like lemon meringue pie that when I put it on before bed, I wind up dreaming of lemon meringue pie! You may think that isn&#x27;t such a bad thing, but I keep eating my pillows!</li>
    <li> Works better than any other hand lotion I&#x27;ve tried, and I love that it has natural ingredients. Lemon scent is so good smelling- like dessert!</li>
    <li> This is the best lemon hand lotion,,,,  I just love it!!!!  its a true lemon,,and the smell stays with you!!!  thanks,  Deanna</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this item because of all the different oils listed in the ingredients.  It&#x27;s true the cream does not leave your skin greasy and does get absorbed fast.  However, despite its thick consistency and the shea butter,  it does not seem to be able to moisturize my hands at all.  The lemon scent is faint, and it&#x27;s more like the flavoring added to lemon meringue pie rather than the strong, refreshing scent of freshly squeezed lemon or lemon essential oil.</li>
    <li> Smells awful, like lemon pie with saccharine filling. Texture is great, but the smell it&#x27;s too sweet and strong. I was hoping this would be a sharp lemon scent but you&#x27;re really getting an artificial fragrance of  cheap lemon cream pie. Btw, this product is cheaper on iherb and Vitacost.</li>
    <li> I order this over and over.  It&#x27;s become a necessity!  I use it mostly at work and people always walk by and ask what smells so good!  Men and women alike ask to borrow it.  It is very rich and thick, but it absorbs almost right away, so you don&#x27;t feel greasy.  It&#x27;s hard to find a hand cream that gets both of those right.</li>
    <li> Smooth and non greasy with a lovely lemon scent, this really makes my hands feel soft. I also use it on my feet and legs and it is just great!</li>
    <li> The cream went into my skin without leaving any grease.  I love this product,  my hands are smoother than they have been in years.</li>
    <li> I like the cream itself but the smell is too strong, so I take a star out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with everything service was great product was as describe Thanks and keep up the great work.</li>
    <li> This hand cream by J. R. Watkins is rich and creamy and goes on nicely and soaks into the skin without being greasy.  It makes my hands feel really good and not so dry.  I also like the lemon cream scent; it reminds me of lemon meringue pie.  Very yummy!  It also  has lots of nourishing natural oils that are beneficial to the skin and I really like that because natural ingredients are so much better for you.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My friend bought me this as a Christmas gift as I had commented on the wonderful aroma when she wore it.  Non-greasy for hands and feet.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hot out of the oven lemon pie fragrance with a nice cream consistency leaving my hands very nice.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite. The smell is really sugary, and it stays a bit sticky and greasy for quite a long time (like, 15 minutes). I was hoping this would be a good tube to keep in the car, but I don&#x27;t want to slick down my steering wheel, so nope.</li>
    <li> I got this hand cream from one of my students as a gift, and I&#x27;m in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;It smells so yummy, I could eat it!  I put it on last night before bed, and I can still smell the yummy lemon scent when I woke up this morning. Plus, it moisturizers really well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about ingredients I use on my body. This lotion is full of safe ingredients, AND it&#x27;s the very best I have ever used for dry hands. I work outside a lot and my hands crack to the point of bleeding at time. This very thick, non-greasy cream is EXCELLENT for dry skin. I use on my legs and feet also. Do not confuse this with their lotion, it&#x27;s a different product.  Buy this for any person who gets very dry skin &amp; chapped hands.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT CREAM FOR DRY SKIN...IT SMELLS TERRIFIC TOO...KEEPS THE SKIN SOFT AND SUPPLE...NO COMPLAINTS..WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO PURCHASE ITEM...</li>
    <li> Lemon smell is the best I&#x27;ve found. And the fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t give me headaches like some perfumy products do. Also not greasy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this!  Great lemony smell, not chemical.  Awesome lotion with many great ingredients.  I bought several to keep every where I go.</li>
    <li> feels good smells good</li>
    <li> On a whim I bought this art target for a ridiculous amount $8.99. It was fabulous. Thick and rich and smells like heaven.</li>
    <li> One of the few products that works on my super dry hands and feet. Love the lemon cream scent.</li>
    <li> If you have never tried the hand creams by J.R. Watkins, you should. Not the lotion, which is good as well, but the hand cream. It&#x27;s an investment well worth ordering online. The majority of the stores that carry the Watkins line do not carry the hand cream. It&#x27;s sold at specialty stores and Cracker Barrel of all places. It&#x27;s the best natural cream for your hands and it reacts differently to the different seasons. Leave skill soft and smooth, without extreme oiliness. Caution, order more than one at a time. It&#x27;s hard to find and it&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
    <li> My skin gets really dry in the winter and this hand cream goes on smoothly without leaving a mess behind. It also leaves you with an overwhelming urge to eat something with lemon icing.</li>
    <li> The wife really likes it. But be warned, it does have a strong lemon cake smell.</li>
    <li> I love the way this lotion completely absorbs, lasts through several hand-washings without needing to be reapplied, and SMELLS so good!</li>
