<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very feminine. love the citrus notes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent. Received a sample from birchbox but it was significantly cheaper on amazon! If you like \\&quot;curious\\&quot;, my other favorite then you will probably like this one too. I always recommend sampling for a week because some days I love a scent and by the end of the week I can&#x27;t stand it. This I&#x27;ve had for a month and still love it. Glass bottle with accessory gems hanging from the cap. Works well and fits in my bathroom recessed cabinet!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is a knock-off or if it&#x27;s genuine that has been stored incorrectly, but the scent if definitely off.  Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Juicy Couture La La ! This fragrance is so clean and fresh ,yet fruity and light. It is just a classic fragrance , and it last all day long. 5 stars !</li>
    <li> Best of Juicy Couture so far</li>
    <li> The smell is way different,than my prior bottle. I don&#x27;t understand but it also doesn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> Totally impressed with the size of the bottle for the price!</li>
    <li> I like the smell. Shipping was slow</li>
    <li> Delicious perfume ..I love it !! ..and very fast delivery ..thanks.</li>
    <li> Save your money. This item smells wonderful but it only lasts about five minutes.</li>
    <li> Looks great and smells AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Spray component broke a few weeks after purchase.</li>
    <li> Everyone wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing that smells so delicious!</li>
    <li> Not quite as strong as I thought it should be... but has lasted me a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal. It smell wonderful and great price...</li>
    <li> My daughter is getting this for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Nice BIG bottle. Worth the buy</li>
    <li> not very strong , but smells lovely</li>
    <li> good price, work good</li>
    <li> Same one in department stores, but for a better price. The box came unharmed and the corners were not bent or dented.</li>
    <li> Pretty bottle. Came so quickly. Smell does last. Its light, fresh and girly. Good deal.</li>
    <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, friends loved it</li>
    <li> What a rip off!!!!!  Does not last!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.......</li>
    <li> Christmas present for daughter, she loves it. Same as buying from an expensive department store, just saved a few bucks..actually more than a few....</li>
    <li> Got it in a timely manner and the perfume is great. Would definitely order again!!!#</li>
    <li> I love this scent, fits me just right. Sweet but sultry at the same time. Not only that, the price was great....bottle is super cute!</li>
    <li> I love it and the shipping time was great!</li>
    <li> My bf really loves this scent but i think i like viva la juicy better. its sweeter than la la and im more of a sweet perfume than floral. this is a good mixture though. pretty good price for the size.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite perfumes so when mine ran out i bought a new one. i don&#x27;t know but the new one i purchased didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> I went to Dillards and liked this perfume seen that it was a better sale on Amazon I purchased the perfume and when I received my package it wasn&#x27;t Juicy Couture Lala, it was the original Juicy Couture perfume. Totally different item!! I refuse to pay shipping to exchange my order so I gave this perfume to my sister and definitely not ordering from amazon in the future.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations was very pleased. The packaging was legit and the scent was fresh and flowery. purchased Jan 2014</li>
    <li> I love the perfume but literally 5 min after I put this on, I cant smell it at all.... not even if I spray my clothes. Very disappointing.  I have another Juicy Couture perfume (purchased from a different seller) and it lasts much longer. I sprayed it on one wrist and this on the other just to confirm and I could smell the other JC perfume (the non LA LA) but not this one later in the evening. Bad.</li>
    <li> What a great deal and another great juicy parfum! It smells fantastic and you can not go wrong with this parfum!</li>
    <li> I purchased a small purse size at Ulta and loved the smell so I wanted to get a full size.  The price is way lower than bricks and mortar stores but the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> It is the best smell. Thank you</li>
    <li> Sampled this through a beauty product company. Liked the smell, so I bought this big bottle. Price is way cheaper than retail &amp; shipped fast. Only complaint is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. Need a few sprays throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great awesome smells good good price. Love it .. couture juicy eau de parfum delicious big bottle lasts for a long time</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and in perfect condition, this was exactly what I wanted and more than met my expectations. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Bottle was damaged when arrived</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted. It smells good, was a good price and it came fast, as Amazon nearly always does.good product. Bigger than I thought it would be too.</li>
    <li> Bottle  was broken  so can&#x27;t even  spray it.</li>
    <li> She loves it and the price was great. Need it, order it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the quality,</li>
    <li> Thank you! Everything was great!</li>
    <li> This perfume was a knock off, my wife was very disappointed</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely amazing and last all day .</li>
    <li> The item was delivered quickly and in great packaging.  It is a very large amount, so I would only recommend this product if you have previously used this perfume and know, for sure, that you like it. It has a very light, crisp, floral scent that you forget you are even wearing, It doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly, it is just very light and easy to get used to. I know this for sure because I have noticed the scent  lingering on my clothes from the previous day, when I go to do laundry. I have been complemented on the scent a few times, but overall, it sticks pretty under the radar (which is a good thing, as strong smells can be offensive to most people).</li>
    <li> Ok, I know these reviews are just about the product, but I would just like to give a shoutout to the people I got mine from, FragranceNet. Not only did they include the exact product as described with fast shipping, but there were like 3-4 different little samples in the box, and a couple emery boards. Just simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product. Ok. I feel like if you&#x27;re buying this much of the stuff you know what it smells like. It&#x27;s clean and feminine, and really cute. I got a sample in my birchbox and fell in love. Of course, birchbox sells it for 90 dollars and FragranceNet had it at 40.50. This is going to be my new signature scent.</li>
    <li> Authentic product! Fast shipping! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I purchased juicy couture for my daughter, she loved it!  This product went beyond expectation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a knock off but it still smells good and it lasted on my skin for about 6 hours. But disappointed amazon is allowed to fool people into believing they getting an authentic product for a low cost. I also purchase the vida LA juicy as well and it was also a knock off. Shame on amazon.</li>
    <li> Given to the lady who wore it with a smile !!</li>
    <li> smells amazing and for a great price especially when compared to shopping at a department store!! perfect for a gift!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells awesome. Great gift idea</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s authentic; however I&#x27;ve received many compliments on the scent.</li>
    <li> So many compliments...</li>
    <li> Great deal and I love the smell</li>
    <li> Expected this to be some tiny bottle of knock off stuff due to the price. Huge bottle.  The real deal. Good price.</li>
    <li> I love love love the way this smells!! Its not too heavy or overpwering and my boyfriend likes it too!</li>
    <li> Honestly I was skeptical before buying this because there were a lot of reviews saying the scent doesn&#x27;t last but I put it on and it lasted the same amount as the perfume I tested in the store and it smelt the same, this is a great deal and 100% authentic</li>
    <li> Smells delicious total strangers stop me and comment all the time</li>
    <li> ordered this as a gift for me mother. She LOVES it. It came very quickly. I ordered late for the birthday and was sure that it would not come in time but it did! Wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and it wasn&#x27;t priced bad for the large bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells great!!!! It stays on me. Smells so good. I love it, matter of fact, im definitely going to have to order more.</li>
    <li> This perfume did not smell like the samples in the department store near me. It was faint and soapy-smelling, which made me think it had been stored improperly and the alcohol had partially evaporated. I was very disappointed with this product, as it is one of my favorites and I did not get the chance to wear it. I gifted it to someone else shortly after.</li>
    <li> I received this perfume and love the smell of it; however, right after I spray it on I can&#x27;t smell it on myself at all.  Something&#x27;s not right here.  I smelled a sample of it and sprayed it on myself and could later smell it on me.  I am not sure if this is diluted or something, but I have to put a ton of it on before I can smell it on me.  Not really sure what&#x27;s going on with this one.  Heads up.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s 100% real and it comes in the box. I love it it smells great. I was scared that it would be fake but it smells exactly the same as the one in the mall!</li>
    <li> This smell was a lot stronger than I remember from previous purchases at different retailers. I still use it but only one spray as the smell is so strong.</li>
    <li> Excellent I love this scent</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product  great price</li>
    <li> Great smell Great price!!!!! you won&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere else!</li>
    <li> love love love love love juicy perfume. This one is my favorite and couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the price. Definitely beats the price I was paying at Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why people are saying the scent doesn&#x27;t last!? I sprayed 3 spritz and got compliments all day at work (8 hours)  Will DEFINITELY purchase again</li>
    <li> Big heavy bottle! Fianc&amp;eacute; loves it!</li>
    <li> I got it as a Christmas present for my mom. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Only giving 2 stars because the the scent is one of my very favorites, but this is not the real thing. Scent hardly lasts an hour... definitely purchase in store!</li>
    <li> This is the real Juicy Couture La La perfume. My bottle was not tampered with, opened, or have a strong alcohol smell.  This fragrance is just so lovely. It&#x27;s hard to describe but I love it!! The bottle is huge too. I&#x27;ll never run out. This fragrance is perfect for day or evening wear but I will probably wear it on weekends or when I&#x27;m out with girlfriends. I have other fragrances I prefer for dates.  37$ well spent. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I search many site for the fragrance and found it here on Amazon from one of their suppliers, the price was fantastic and the scent, lets just say it is glorious and well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love it! smells amazing , and about it being fake pretty sure it&#x27;s the real deal it&#x27;s very light not strong like the other  Parfums made by juicy couture so if it doesn&#x27;t last long that&#x27;s why, not because it&#x27;s fake it&#x27;s light and some lighter smelling sents  seem not to last long . if you&#x27;re scared it&#x27;s fake don&#x27;t buy it off amazon go buy it from Macy&#x27;s  or kohl&#x27;s to put your mind at ease. definitely will repurchase this when I run out.</li>
    <li> I cannot smell this after it has been sprayed. I have a family member that has the same perfume and it smells great!!!! I am wondering if this is the real Juicy</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good. Wife specifically requested this. There&#x27;s a number of levels of quality in perfumes. This is good price for the quality and quantity.</li>
    <li> I will be getting this again when I run out. I love this perfume and I get more and cheaper from you than @ JCP. Thank you</li>
    <li> Very light scent not what I like dont stays long</li>
    <li> This is NOT Juicy Couture!! THIS IS DEFINITELY a Knock off!!</li>
    <li> smell is never the first sense i use. so colognes and perfumes i don&#x27;t ever buy unless its for someone else... that someone else with this purchase really liked this.</li>
    <li> I guess good-it was a gift</li>
    <li> Came early! I was shocked when it came 2 days later after I had ordered as standard shipping. Pretty heavy too which is cool. Really cute bottle. Smells awesome and is the real deal juicy couture packaging.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my teenage girl, exquisite fragrance, fresh and young . The presentation of the bottle is cute . Thank you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift but it came great!:)and awesome price</li>
    <li> It arrived before time and exceeded my expectations...thank you</li>
    <li> Great Service and item</li>
    <li> It smelled old not like in the department stores, I dont know if I&#x27;ll order again👎</li>
    <li> I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I LOVE LA LA AND NOT ONLY IS IT WATERED DOWN, IT SMEELS NOTHING LIKE THE ORGINAL. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
