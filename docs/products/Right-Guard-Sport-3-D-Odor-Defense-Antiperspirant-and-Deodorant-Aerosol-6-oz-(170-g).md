    <li> I&#x27;ve used Right Guard Unscented for years and loved it. The product shown was not what shipped. It&#x27;s not really the sellers fault, it&#x27;s Right Guard. What shipped was the \\&quot;New\\&quot; unscented. It&#x27;s called unscented, but it&#x27;s certainly NOT unscented.</li>
    <li> This had been difficult to find in my local stores.  Glad it was available online.</li>
    <li> The product will work but not what I expected. The labeling and photo are different from what I received. I thought I was getting some new or different from what I usually buy. Which is why I made the made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good product. Can&#x27;t fine unscented in the stores.</li>
    <li> Hard to find product, only spray deodorant I use</li>
    <li> purchased for an actor on a movie set here because it is his favorite. Unfortunately it took too long to get here and received it after the movie wrapped. Will share with my sone and see how he likes it and will come back to add to review! Thank you</li>
    <li> This is getting harder and harder to find in the stores.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite anti-perspirant. He will use no other and they don&#x27;t carry it at Target, CVS, or Walgreens. I buy it here and he loves it.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that I&#x27;ll use, no sticky feeling and no strong scent that tries to over power my cologne</li>
    <li> Only gets one star because the review won&#x27;t go through unless I give a star.&lt;br /&gt;THIS ITEM IS SIMPLY PUT...  NOT UNSCENTED ANYMORE.&lt;br /&gt;The old unscented product was awesome. No scent and stopped the stink.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the pic. The new \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; STINKS something awful.&lt;br /&gt;Just a damn disgrace how they discontinued this product. Just made absolutely no sense...</li>
    <li> My significant other has been using this product for years. Over the last few years and increasingly it is getting harder to find in drugstores. I am glad to have found this excellent product on amazon. The unscented deodorants are hard to find, yet we prefer them quite a bit.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  Cannot find this Right Guard Product in stores, glad to be able to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> The order came quicker than I thought it would. It was easy to just click a few times to shop for a product and the product is very good too. I coulde not find this unscented product anywhere on the shelf.</li>
    <li> Hi, emty fast, but is cool.</li>
    <li> Great product.  For me (personal), it makes me too dry.</li>
    <li> I find this product as advertised. Since I am allergic to insect bites, the unsented product is what I prefer. The smell of other products attracts stinging insects.</li>
    <li> This is an aerosolized powder product which triggered ferocious sneezing and congestion.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> This is really unscented and works really well for my husband.  My husband works in the Florida heat and really needs something strong to keep him from having body order and this is the first unscented deodorant that works.  I have fragrance sensitivities and can not have him using any product with a perfume smell.</li>
