    <li> Leaves my skin really moist. It&#x27;s like lotion + soap. Definitely a time saver. Reccomended by a friend and I&#x27;m glad. It&#x27;s my go-to soap</li>
    <li> not a good soap bar for a working man.  Will not clean my husbands hands, he is a mechanic.</li>
    <li> Great soap! Cleans well without being drying. I appreciate the fragrance is minimal. Prefer it to Irish Spring which I&#x27;ve used for a long (long, long) time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and I wasn&#x27;t sure he would even try it. He&#x27;s a hard core one brand one scent soap user. However, I thought this could help his skin and actually be better than what he&#x27;s been using for so many years. He also refuses to use any type of bodywash. When I surprised him with it he actually told me he had been looking at it in the store, was curious and contemplating trying it. The surprise was on me I guess, and it felt great that he was actually looking forward to using it. (He did finish his current bar first though). He told me at first he wasn&#x27;t sure how much he liked it, but after a few days it was growing on him more and more as time went by. I looked the smell of the house/bathroom after he used it much better than his go to brand. It was softer and milder but still manly and was attractive to me! Not much was said for a while until he came to me one day and ask where I got it, how much it was and that he wanted more. I would say you made a picky stubborn man a new customer and believer. He&#x27;s not much for words and really only said he liked the way his skin felt and the smell was nice and not too strong. I would say the biggest impact shown was that acting speak louder than words when he requested more!</li>
    <li> Should I say it&#x27;s great?&lt;br /&gt;Should I say it&#x27;s amazing?&lt;br /&gt;Guys.....it&#x27;s soap...it does what it need to do.&lt;br /&gt;The sent disappears after a few hours but have been getting complements about it. Its good soap.</li>
    <li> Truly a very refreshing product. Good moisturizing, no irritation and my husband love the scent.</li>
    <li> Best product from Dove. I really loved this soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad. In our house we dont use anything but dove for over 15 years. I love that they came out with a mens line. It smells good too. Shot i wouldnt mind using it</li>
    <li> Great smelling and lasts all day.  Keeps the hubby smelling good!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap...it cleans you.  It does it&#x27;s job effectively.  And manly enough for those questioning that aspect of it.</li>
    <li> This is a very mild and silky soap, please buy if you love freshness, this is my third purchase in a row</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband he love the way it smell fresh and clean</li>
    <li> Works and smells great.  What more can I ask of a deodorant soap?  Not a sickly sweet teen-man scent, either; it just smells like a clean, man&#x27;s soap that a woman won&#x27;t immediately want to steal.</li>
    <li> Dove seems to always be recommended by doctors for washing the face.  Bought to help with my sons acne.  Seems to be doing the job.</li>
    <li> My BF loves this soap.  I bought it for him to try when it first came on the market.  He even buys it for his own place.  I like it too....a nice, fresh but masculine smell.  Especially love the price here too!  Bugs me to pay more than $2.50 a bar.</li>
    <li> product as described--shipped in 2 days</li>
    <li> I like the soap s lot !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very nice and makes me feel refreshed after shower , I like the fact that it leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh , The amount of soap released / per shower taken is just enough without making you feel like a snowman covered in bubbles .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I noticed that after a few use the soap melts ( dissapears ) faster , even though I put it in the dripping soap dish where it remains dry .</li>
    <li> cleans good, smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry, and lasts long enough.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  I love Dove for Men+Care.  It does a nice job moisturizing in those cold winter months.  Not enough that an occasional lotion isn&#x27;t needed but it does help.  Much better than your average Irish Spring or Dial soap.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift, It smell fabulous to me. So far no complaints, no allergic reactions and no sending this back. It served it purpose and was a hit. too shay.</li>
    <li> good product but definitely pricy.  You can get a better deal in the store.</li>
    <li> yes I like the product</li>
