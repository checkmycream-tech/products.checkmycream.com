      <li>Thrilled, these are my go to hair tools and have yet to use all of them because I&#x27;m stuck on the one size!</li>

      <li>and I loved the curls ...</li>
      <li>loved it I can have any curl type I want when ever.</li>
      <li>If it wasn&#x27;t good</li>
      <li>It warms up quickly and leaves a perfect curl</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it and it gave me great curls that lasted all day.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>

      <li>It worked wonderfully for me as a professional hair dresser during prom season</li>
      <li>Just watch out for your hands and neck, because it&#x27;s easy to burn yourself!</li>
      <li>Look for something better.</li>
      <li>I really am pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I no longer have to travel with more than one pair or be concerned about the cord because it has a sturdy cord</li>
      <li>the glove is OK, helps with the heat</li>
      <li>Love the interchangeable heads.</li>
      <li>My second one works great!</li>
      <li>ps: i wish the glove worked a bit better protecting my hands</li>
      <li>, it comes in a cute storage bag ..</li>
      <li>Curls lasted days on my hair, while I never managed to keep curls more than 30minutes.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll become accustomed with continued use.</li>
      <li>These curling wand were magical.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to know what should I do about it.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this purchase because of the four sets of interchangeable iron sizes.</li>
      <li>I bought this Iron set because I wanted to get a quality item that would work most efficiently for my hair and included versatile options.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that it has interchangeable heads.</li>
      <li>The product didn&#x27;t even curl my hair, and on top of that damaged the hell out of it.  </li>
      <li>I love how this is a multi-size curling iron</li>
      <li>Got my Curling set on time, I love using it.</li>
      <li>When it did work, it curled beautifully because the iron gets super hot.  </li>
      <li>It takes me 3 or 4 tries to get perfect at it.</li>
      <li>and you can easily burn yourself.</li>
      <li>heats up very quick.</li>
      <li>Anyway, this is not a well made device to break so easily.</li>
      <li>The iron is still in great shape and looks good as new but the internal parts in the electrical cord (midway) are shorting out.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands and this is by far the best one out there!</li>
      <li>The screen doesn&#x27;t light up anymore when I plug</li>
      <li>this is overall a great iron to have.</li>
      <li>if using for \\&quot;pleasure\\&quot; make sure the device is unplugged first.</li>
      <li>With the bigger barell I could get a beautiful look, very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works quickly and efficiently.</li>
      <li>Therefore it is much better protected than any of my other curling irons that do not have their own pouches.</li>
      <li>The curls were amazing while the the iron last.</li>
      <li>When this thing gets hot, it&#x27;s SUPER HOT!  </li>
      <li>Gets super hot fast.</li>
      <li>My hair stays curled all day and most times the next day.</li>
      <li>I really like that it&#x27;s titanium and gets hot, but the quality control isn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
      <li>looks exactly like in the picture ..</li>
      <li>The only thing I would suggest is maybe a rubber bumper / resistant top like the curling irons with clips have.  </li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m back to finding a better quality product that won&#x27;t die out on me.</li>
      <li>first, dont be fooled by the picture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product so far, but it does take some getting used to, I have never own a curling iron that has been hot all around, the previous one I owned had a tip on the top to maneuver it easily, so I had a bit of difficulty with this.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who is interested.</li>
      <li>works really well</li>
      <li>I hope i&#x27;m not damaging my hair too much</li>
      <li>, Thank you verry much</li>
      <li>i must of went through 8 diff kinds before discovering this fantastic curl iron and it comes with a bonus of 5 different sizes!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This is probably the best curling iron-wand I have ever used but am extremely disappointed it didn&#x27;t last more than a year.</li>
      <li>Seller needs to check their vendor on this issue...the box says 2&amp;#34; but it is not even a true 1 1/2&amp;#34; and only measures to 1 1/4&amp;#34; (see pics in my product review)</li>
      <li>The first iron I ordered early in Decrmber never made it &amp; the tracking was messed up.</li>
      <li>Liked it until then not sure what went wrong.&lt;br</li>
      <li>my only problem is that idk exactly how hot I should use the temp without burning my hair, in the instructions they don&#x27;t have a guide</li>
      <li>I definitely regret not spending the extra money for a better quality curling wand.</li>
      <li>I love the option of different barrels but you can not use them for the same head.  </li>
      <li>I loved the curling iron if only the life on it was longer than 4 months after that it was a waste because it didnt work</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll know not to go too high ..</li>
      <li>I am so disappointed, because it really was a wonderful device.&lt;br</li>
      <li>you would need to cool them down first to remove from the handle.</li>
      <li>My first one was defective but they refunded my money and gave me a new one right away with absolutely no hassle.</li>
      <li>it didnt look new.</li>
      <li>This product comes with a soft case for the glove, main unit, and all of the attachments.</li>
      <li>so, for a device that dies one year after it&#x27;s bought, while I didn&#x27;t use it very often and I took extremely good care of it, it is way too expensive..</li>
      <li>This the second time we have tried to order this curling iron set with the 2&amp;#34; head (but first time from this seller)</li>
      <li>I am also unable to exchange for a new one that works as I really loved this</li>
      <li>Very versatile with the different sizes.</li>
      <li>We already have the same set with the 1 1/2&amp;#34; head and really wanted the 2&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I have a cabinet full of inexpensive to expensive curling irons that I have had for 12-15 years that still work fine.</li>
      <li>be careful because it gets really hot</li>
      <li>However, the digital buttons were super sensitive and as I&#x27;d be curling, I would unknowingly either be turning the temperature down or shutting the iron off.  </li>
      <li>Other than that I like the curling wand very much.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend it, although I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far.</li>
      <li>Apparently the warranty is lifetime with this fee...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s past the 30 day Amazon return period, and to utilize the warranty you must register the product within 90 days [which I thank my lucky stars that I&#x27;m within that 90 day window because I had not registered]</li>

    <li> These are so awesome. If you haven&#x27;t tried them you need to. My hair stays curled all day and most times the next day.</li>
    <li> Very versatile with the different sizes. Gets super hot fast. Works quickly and efficiently. Definitely recommend this product. In a great travel case too!</li>
    <li> It stoped working after only using it twice! It just stopped heating up. I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product. I&#x27;d love to know what should I do about it.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t even curl my hair, and on top of that damaged the hell out of it.  I definitely regret not spending the extra money for a better quality curling wand.</li>
    <li> These curling wand were magical. Curls lasted days on my hair, while I never managed to keep curls more than 30minutes. With the bigger barell I could get a beautiful look, very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it just stopped working. No idea why or how. It turned off while it was heating up. And just never turned on again. The screen doesn&#x27;t light up anymore when I plug it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it one year ago, I used it like.. twice a month. I never managed to fill the lifetime warranty on their website. I am so disappointed, because it really was a wonderful device.&lt;br /&gt;And so, for a device that dies one year after it&#x27;s bought, while I didn&#x27;t use it very often and I took extremely good care of it, it is way too expensive..</li>
    <li> So I been using for a while now, it comes in a cute storage bag .. looks exactly like in the picture .. my only problem is that idk exactly how hot I should use the temp without burning my hair, in the instructions they don&#x27;t have a guide so I&#x27;ll know not to go too high .. I hope i&#x27;m not damaging my hair too much</li>
    <li> Stopped heating after 5th use. Liked it until then not sure what went wrong.&lt;br /&gt;But I was not happy with product.</li>
    <li> Used once for a few minutes and then after a couple of minutes it just stopped working all together and never again!&lt;br /&gt; A complete WASTE of money!</li>
    <li> This worked for about a year, then just quit on me saying error and flashing red. Very disappointed a quality curling wand didn&#x27;t last longer than  a year.</li>
    <li> I love how this is a multi-size curling iron and I can change sizes instantly without having to plug in another one.  The only thing I would suggest is maybe a rubber bumper / resistant top like the curling irons with clips have.  When this thing gets hot, it&#x27;s SUPER HOT!  In any case, I like it.</li>
    <li> I really am pleased with this purchase. I no longer have to travel with more than one pair or be concerned about the cord because it has a sturdy cord</li>
    <li> This is probably the best curling iron-wand I have ever used but am extremely disappointed it didn&#x27;t last more than a year. I have a cabinet full of inexpensive to expensive curling irons that I have had for 12-15 years that still work fine. The iron is still in great shape and looks good as new but the internal parts in the electrical cord (midway) are shorting out. The iron starts to heat up and turns itself off due to the poor electrical structure of the cord. I am really sad because this is a great product and appeared to be built sturdy and not cheap. The cord is thick and not flimsy. The curls were amazing while the the iron last. Now I&#x27;m back to finding a better quality product that won&#x27;t die out on me. I&#x27;m just a disappointed customer considering this was not a cheap purchase... What happened to you get what you pay for! I&#x27;ll be contacting the Cortex company since Amazon and company Five Star whom fulfills the order won&#x27;t replace the item. I guess they don&#x27;t stand by the product either.</li>
    <li> Just watch out for your hands and neck, because it&#x27;s easy to burn yourself! It comes with a protective glove, so they do their best to save you from yourself.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it has interchangeable heads. Error message popped up after 5th use,never worked again😡</li>
    <li> It stopped heating up the same day I received it. First time it worked and the second time I curled half of the hair and then it just died.&lt;br /&gt;It did look very good and was in a cute bag and I loved the curls ... still waste of money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure of everyone else but my wand works Perfect! If it says error, the attachment must not be in all the way. The heat for a regular wand is 300 and 370 degrees. The wand is a great curling tool and if you want to learn how to curl your hair, YouTube videos will be coming soon. xmorganelise</li>
    <li> They are awesome! Works perfectly find. The only con was that my bag has ripped inside only after a few days. But the curling wands are perfect</li>
    <li> very good. My first one was defective but they refunded my money and gave me a new one right away with absolutely no hassle. My second one works great! Love the interchangeable heads.</li>
    <li> The first iron I ordered early in Decrmber never made it &amp; the tracking was messed up. In order to have the wand by Christmas they went above &amp; beyond and had it overnighted for me.  Awesome people to work with as well as an awesome product.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been only a month and this thing broke on me.  I didn&#x27;t even use it on a daily basis and now it randomly goes dead and won&#x27;t turn back on.  When it did work, it curled beautifully because the iron gets super hot.  However, the digital buttons were super sensitive and as I&#x27;d be curling, I would unknowingly either be turning the temperature down or shutting the iron off.  I really like that it&#x27;s titanium and gets hot, but the quality control isn&#x27;t worth the money.  Look for something better.</li>
    <li> Great set, great price!! Thrilled, these are my go to hair tools and have yet to use all of them because I&#x27;m stuck on the one size!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This product comes with a soft case for the glove, main unit, and all of the attachments. Therefore it is much better protected than any of my other curling irons that do not have their own pouches. Well I pull it out one day to use it only to find that the LCD underneath (not on the surface) seems to be cracked and the device can not be turned on at all. It&#x27;s past the 30 day Amazon return period, and to utilize the warranty you must register the product within 90 days [which I thank my lucky stars that I&#x27;m within that 90 day window because I had not registered] and they charge you $24.95 for a replacement. Apparently the warranty is lifetime with this fee...but there are caveats. Anyway, this is not a well made device to break so easily.</li>
    <li> Happy customer 200% satisfy, Thank you verry much</li>
    <li> Got my Curling set on time, I love using it. It takes me 3 or 4 tries to get perfect at it. Glove definately helps, but you have to be very careful with it around your face. I burnt one spot on each arm, and a big one by my neck, while I was holding the curler down. So never hold it downwards, learnt my lesson:(. It gives real nice bouncy curls, and makes the hair looks gorgeous.</li>
    <li> first, dont be fooled by the picture. there are only 4 detachable parts. not 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however this is overall a great iron to have. its really fast when working on other people&#x27;s hair. took me longer to do my hair. heats up very quick. be careful because it gets really hot and you can easily burn yourself. the glove is OK, helps with the heat but it is def not heat proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when my package arrived, i did notice it looked like a returned item or someone else had opened it before. it didnt look new. there was tape on the sides of the box and the box itself looked kinda dirty.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it and it gave me great curls that lasted all day. Unfortunately after one year of owning, it stopped working out to of the blue one day😭 However, my mom called the company to inquire about buying a new base and was told to ship the old one back to the company along with $24.95 if you are in the US, they will ship you a new one. I shipped my non functioning base last week and am awaiting my new one.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I just keep burning my left arm. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is interested.</li>
    <li> Basically, this will stay hot for a few minutes, then after that the heat will turn off &amp; say Error. Also, this item did not come with instructions, just a brochure that describes what the item does instead of how to use it properly. I am also unable to exchange for a new one that works as I really loved this but the heating did not work.</li>
    <li> i would have given them 5 stars if they would heat up just a bit faster.  guess i am used to my rusk irons. ps: i wish the glove worked a bit better protecting my hands</li>
    <li> I loved the curling iron if only the life on it was longer than 4 months after that it was a waste because it didnt work</li>
    <li> loved it I can have any curl type I want when ever.</li>
    <li> This the second time we have tried to order this curling iron set with the 2&amp;#34; head (but first time from this seller) Both times the product did not match the seller&#x27;s description OR the description on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t blame the seller 100% for that but if you read the reviews it seems we are not the only one with that complaint.  Some people say they got the 2&amp;#34;, but unless they measure it they probably don&#x27;t even realize how undersize it is. We already have the same set with the 1 1/2&amp;#34; head and really wanted the 2&amp;#34;.  Seller needs to check their vendor on this issue...the box says 2&amp;#34; but it is not even a true 1 1/2&amp;#34; and only measures to 1 1/4&amp;#34; (see pics in my product review)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. If it wasn&#x27;t good I probably wouldn&#x27;t have gotten any that night... if you know what I mean.. ..ps if using for \\&quot;pleasure\\&quot; make sure the device is unplugged first.</li>
    <li> Great iron set. It worked wonderfully for me as a professional hair dresser during prom season</li>
    <li> The best clipless curling iron I have ever used. I have tried many different brands and this is by far the best one out there!</li>
    <li> works really well and i had the hardest time finding a hair curler that works for my hair. i must of went through 8 diff kinds before discovering this fantastic curl iron and it comes with a bonus of 5 different sizes!</li>
    <li> I love the option of different barrels but you can not use them for the same head.  you would need to cool them down first to remove from the handle. Other than that I like the curling wand very much.  It warms up quickly and leaves a perfect curl</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy with this purchase!  I bought this for my daughter for xmas and she couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it.  Saying, &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t work!&amp;#34;  I thought it was my daughter.  After the craziness of the holidays, I tried it myself and got an &amp;#34;error&amp;#34;.  It just does NOT turn &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;!!!  And now it is too late to return it.  Customers beware.</li>
    <li> I bought this Iron set because I wanted to get a quality item that would work most efficiently for my hair and included versatile options. I am pleased with this purchase because of the four sets of interchangeable iron sizes. It&#x27;s a great product so far, but it does take some getting used to, I have never own a curling iron that has been hot all around, the previous one I owned had a tip on the top to maneuver it easily, so I had a bit of difficulty with this. But I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll become accustomed with continued use. It curls my hair nicely, the curls stay in for quite some time as well. I would recommend it, although I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far.</li>
