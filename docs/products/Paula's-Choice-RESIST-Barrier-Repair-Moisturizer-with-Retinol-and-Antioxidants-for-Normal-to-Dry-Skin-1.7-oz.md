    <li> Works great but if you&#x27;re oily it&#x27;s a bit shiny</li>
    <li> Love this product! Love resist line and the price is affordable enough so you can get more of their great offerings. Save $10 off your first order here [...]</li>
    <li> Pretty effective for the price. Good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite face lotion ever</li>
    <li> Loved at first and then started getting a lot more clogged pores around my chin and jaw line. It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough either. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for acne prone skin, loved the way it felt though!</li>
    <li> It is not as moisturizing as I had hoped. I have dry skin but not too dry and I had to apply another moisturizer over it.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is Epic! I love this product and I am so glad I tried this moisturizer out. I use it twice a day or after I get out of the shower and the texture is smooth and thin, not thick and greecy. I always feel refreshed and my skin is super smooth! Defenitely Try! It is so worth it!</li>
    <li> Great product for your face without hurting your purse</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my face.Still searching for anti sagging and age spot miracle, and yes I use vitamin C serum I mix fresh,hyaluronic acid, AHA cream and sunscreen containing ceremides and niacinamide.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this lotion at first. I only started using it daily because I was out of everything else.&lt;br /&gt;I think it works better when it is *patted on the skin-not rubbed. I even use it over my finished make-up look to help my overall finished look appear less matted &amp;/or dry.&lt;br /&gt;PATTING it is key. :)&lt;br /&gt;It leaves the skin very hydrated for long periods of time- even my stubbornly dry, aging skin (I&#x27;m 38). It gives the skin a youthful dewier look.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning before makeup &amp; at night before bed.</li>
    <li> I ran into a friend who looked absolutely great.  I ask what kind of makeup do you use?  She told me it wasn&#x27;t the makeup, but her skin care that had made the difference.  I just had to try this miracle moisterizer for myself.  The Resist Barrier Repair Moisterizer with Retinol by Paula&#x27;s Choice is so good it is hard to RESIST.  I do not plan to run out of this product.</li>
    <li> Skin had a reaction and so I had to return this.....</li>
    <li> Great product, but pump is defective.</li>
    <li> This product is FANTASTIC!!! I have very sensitive skin and have tried a variety of moisturizers which are too greasy or make my skin break out.  This product is light, feels great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t make it break out.  I highly recommend it and will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I am a huge PC fan. I am using this along with the CLEAR line and up until a week ago her Vitamin C Serum. (I switched to a new one because the PC one was too expensive and I used is 2x a day so it was a monthly expense-- I am now using &amp;#34;OZ Naturals - THE BEST Vitamin C Serum For Your Face - Organic Vitamin C + Amino + Hyaluronic Acid Serum- Clinical Strength 20% Vitamin C with Vegan H&amp;#34; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wanted to start using a Retinol to my routine but everything I have tried in the past has dried my skin out SO bad. So I thought this was perfect since its in a moisturizer. I use this at night as my last step. I have only been using for about a week but I can see a difference. I had a red bump on my cheek for like 3 months (was not a zit it was just a red bump and it appeared out of no where) and it is completely  gone! The consistency is nice and moisturizing. I have combo oily/dry skin. It has no scent whatsoever.(I have read on her website some people said it smells- but they must have super sensitive noses because I dont smell anything)  I like her products because they are fragrance free and she does not test on animals :)</li>
    <li> Like Paula&#x27;s Choice products. I have dry skin and this product keeps my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Gives me moisture with a touch of retinol.  Doesn&#x27;t break my acne prone skin out.</li>
    <li> Great formula. Not greasy. And keep skin moisturized.</li>
