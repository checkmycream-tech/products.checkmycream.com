<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My son has tried various brands of hair product and Suavecito is the only product that holds during exercise.  He has coarse, medium length hair and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my hair as I would have liked. It holds hair fairly ok, but doesn&#x27;t give wet look.</li>
    <li> Great price for the 3 pack of Suavecito pomade! Smells great with moderate hold and is water soluble. Have received many complements using this product.</li>
    <li> Great hold; love this pomade best on the market for thick hair w/cow licks.</li>
    <li> This is the best pomade I could find, and I have tried a lot of them.  It smells amazing and washes out so easily.  Holds my hair in place all day without flaking.  If your hair gets messed up just throw in some water and comb through.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this stuff. Strong hold. Not crispy and isn&#x27;t greasy looking. A little goes a long way and a jar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Been through a few different brands and so far this is the only one I have re-purchased and I got the 3 pack to make sure I have enough. Even got a coworker to use it and he feels the same as I do with Suavecito.</li>
    <li> Awesome hold and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Like them!! Delivered so fast</li>
    <li> Best Pomade product out there. Smells great, long lasting hold, and water soluble. I am on my last of my most recent 3 pack and will definitely be re-ordering soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support this US made product. They really know what they are doing!</li>
    <li> The best pomade out there...</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this stuff, and I really love masculine clean smell it carries, not too too shiny! Just right!</li>
    <li> Barber recommended, it smells good, it holds well, and the quantity for the price is right!</li>
    <li> This pomade is great. I&#x27;ve tried a few, but like this the best. The hold is great, smells good as well.</li>
    <li> I like Sauvecito. I think it has a good smell and a decent hold. It is a bit, um, tackier than I like sometimes. It&#x27;s price isn&#x27;t terrible either, especially when compared to the other, more boutique brands. I do a simple high fade, side part, contour. No huge pompadour or anything. It holds it well and adds a nice little luster. I def think it has enough hold for the pomp crowd.&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I still prefer the tres Flores moulding pomade. When it comes to bang-for-buck, the tres Flores is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> Got this product for a nephew of mine.  He loves this product!  A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells great, stays in all day, washes out very easy with water.</li>
    <li> Nice and strong pomade, holds hair in place and gives it a very shiny look. Will buy more before I run out</li>
    <li> what can I say, damn good product works just as good as layrite and about 5 bucks less..well worth it</li>
    <li> Great product will be buying some more frequently..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing since sliced bread!</li>
    <li> Is the best pomade i have ever tried. It smells good and works great.&lt;br /&gt;i am so glad my barber told me about this. If you have a comb over this is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP ** it works way better if you use when your hair is completely dry**</li>
    <li> Works well to style hair, smells nice and washes out easy. Have been using Suavecito for awhile now.</li>
    <li> Great pomade. I&#x27;ve used other brands and find they leave my hair very oily. It isn&#x27;t good with heat it loses hold when you sweat or if it gets to hot.</li>
    <li> the only product i use for my hair. hands down the best pomade out there. It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair all greasy. Best out there.</li>
    <li> I love the hold and smell of it. When dry, it doesnt flake and is very easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> As always, I think that suavecito pomade it&#x27;s the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff you can buy for sure. And this deal is legit.... I love it, and so will you</li>
    <li> Fantastic, works as expected.  The right consistency of flexibility, yet it doesn&#x27;t stiffen up so much that you feel like you have a helmet in your hair.  Works well for my asian hair in molding and semi-spiking applications.</li>
    <li> Best pomade in the market! It smells great too</li>
    <li> I bought this three pack 4 months ago, and am barely haflway on my last can. Smells great, looks great and washes right off in the shower. Getting ready to order another 3 pack.</li>
    <li> I son had his hair professionally cut the other day and the guy that cut it was using this, It smell very manly it also has a wet look and great hold with put being stiff, My son and I fell in love with it  great product for the money</li>
    <li> Great deal.  My kids used to buy it at their barber shop.  I got three for three for the price of one.</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff. It Last all day and has a great smell. I will be getting more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Its like a pomade however has more of a gel characteristic to it. I enjoy using this product since it smells great holds in my style all day with out making my hair look dry or cheap at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works great I was introduced to this product at my barber shop and later found it was produced in my home town. Amazon sells its much cheaper then they do at my saloon. I also like the fact that there are very minimal ingredients in this so rest assured you know your not putting in a whole bunch of chemicals in your hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best pomade that I have ever used. I have been using it for over 3 years and I absolutely love it. It keeps my hair smelling and looking great. It does not make your hair sticky at all either. The price is definitely reasonable as this product is high quality. My hair stays the same from the moment I apply this pomade up till when I sleep. This pomade is water soluble therefore, a little bit of water can get it out. I have received tons of compliments on the look of my hair and have tried several other pomades, such as American Crew and Axe. However I have never felt as satisfied as I feel with this product. I definitely give it 5 Stars and recommend it to anyone looking for a classy look or just a new hair product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this pomade. I love how it smells, i love that it&#x27;s made in the U.S. and best of all i love how my sons hair looks every morning! This seller had the cheapest for the set of 3, i usually try to keep business within my community but we moved a couple months back and i no longer frequent the barber shop where i would buy one for $12. This set is definitely a good deal.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Only thing I use now</li>
    <li> I used to believe that there was no hair product in this world that could hold down my TWO cowlicks for my thick Asian hair.  My barber recommended and used this stuff on my hair and I have never looked back since.  I get compliments all the time now for my hairstyle.  Thank you Suavacito!</li>
    <li> Amazing love this stuff</li>
    <li> awesome product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking that I purchased the strong hold 3 pack but surprisingly, it still holds strong! The price is very reasonable as well!</li>
    <li> Suavecito is by far my favorite product to use in my hair! Will buy again! Holds great and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Best pomade available, and washes out easily.</li>
    <li> One of the best pomaded I have tried&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried this you&#x27;re missing out get it now you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
    <li> the best product ever</li>
    <li> This is great pomade. Smells good, good price when you buy the 3-pack. Only drawback is it can leave your hair a little frizzy if you get too much water into it after you apply the product.</li>
    <li> the smell it&#x27;s good, it gives a nice smooth hold and it&#x27;s not greasy at all, my clientes love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome product delivered very quickly. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what was in the picture &amp; it came quick .i love the suavecito pomade It&#x27;s what was in the picture &amp; it came quick .thank you some much</li>
    <li> Good Price, Good shipping. Would be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there!!! I have tried so many pomades trying to find the right one. I will use this stuff as long as i have hair!</li>
    <li> After trying several other pomades out there I found myself coming back to Suavecito. and the 3pack is an extreamly good value for such a good product.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great shine and perfect hold!</li>
    <li> Not really much to say about this pomade that I haven&#x27;t said before. After many years of use, it&#x27;s still my favorite. I ended up cutting my hair a bit short last time but the hold from this pomade was strong enough to keep it slicked back all day. I&#x27;ve used other products like Layrite Deluxe and Super Hold but I like the Suavecito Original Hold better. I have yet to try the Firme formulation but if I need something stronger, I&#x27;ll probably give it a shot too. I really like their products and the shipping is always fast.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since my barber showed it to me 3 years ago. It smells great and I love the fact that it washes out easily with just water and that I can restyle it by just adding water and running through my hair with a comb. One of the most affordable pomades out there. I haven&#x27;t tried others like Layrite but I think this will be good for a while. I buy a 3 pack because I know I&#x27;ll most likely use them all or I&#x27;ll just give them to my friends who I&#x27;ve converted to using Suavecito, and it&#x27;s a bit cheaper than buying them individually.</li>
    <li> If you have longish hair, need solid hold, and don&#x27;t want to get gouged to the tune of American Crew prices, this stuff is beyond legit. When I discovered Suavecito, it put an end to months of trying different gels and pomades. As soon as I finished this 3-pack, I moved on to ordering the huge salon-size pot, which is an even better value.</li>
    <li> Great product and definitely lasts a lot longer than you&#x27;d expect. It usually takes me about a month to a month and a half to finish using one. So getting three would definitely keep your supply of great looks for a while.</li>
    <li> Super strong hold, nice shine, long lasting .. although it breaks down in the heat quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I use this brand specifically because it works well, smells great, not hard on your budget, and is very easy to wash out. Would recommend this to anyone looking to style their hair.</li>
    <li> I only recently started growing my hair out, and I have gone through many different types of gel, cream, putty, etc. Suavecito has been the only product that keeps my hair in order, without it feeling greasy or like a hard shell. I can run my fingers through my hair with no difficulty. Highly recommend this pomade!!</li>
    <li> Suavecito pomade is the best I have ever used. It hold and smells great.</li>
    <li> Anmazibg! I&#x27;ve used other pomaded but this one WORKS  for me !  I just put a little in my hair when my hair is damp and it stays rock hard until I go to bed  best hair product I&#x27;ve got ! And one small tub last me a whole month! I do my hair every day ! Sometimes 2 times per day .... I GUARANTEE  I will be buying more</li>
    <li> Read raving reviews about this product so I went ahead and ordered a few. After using it for about two weeks, still have over half the first tub of it left, it&#x27;s not my cup of tea. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, for all intents and purposes, it does what it is supposed to do; holds your style all day long. I&#x27;m just not a big fan of the gel-like properties it has. Suavecito means smooth in Spanish, and that this Gel Pomade is. It doesn&#x27;t wash out as easy as one is lead to believe though&#x27; after all, it still contains castor oil and beeswax in the ingredients. It has a soapy smell to it, which is pleasing at first, but can get overwhelming after smelling it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does harden like a gel, which I did not like much, but it doesn&#x27;t flake and is easy to re-comb, albeit you&#x27;re near water, if not, consider yourself sh*t-out-of-luck. I would recommend this to those that have never worn grease in their hair before and wish to have something pliable that will hold a nice pomp. For those grease fiends, this can be a step backwards to what we like, shiny, greasy dues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, I like it, but not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> A staple in my husbands morning routine :) doesn&#x27;t make his hair too stiff.</li>
    <li> If you got some thick hair like me, you gotta try this! I&#x27;ve tried others, like moco de gorilla, tres Flores and grease. None of them held my hair the way I needed it. So I decided to try suavecito, and ordered the firmé hold. Toda de aquella&#x27;s carnal! It was the best pomade I&#x27;ve ever used, but I decided to go with the regular hold and it works pretty damn good, but there is a big difference between the two, pero sabés que, it&#x27;ll keep you looking firmé all day homes. And it smells pretty good too. I give it four stars because it was as strong as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend is obsessed with this product I bought it for him as a gift and he loves it this is my second time ordering it and the second time I had to order a three pack because he loves it so much</li>
    <li> My Hubbie loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Its one of the best hair products to use and it got here exactly when it said it would thank you!</li>
    <li> Best pomade I&#x27;ve ever used!!! I&#x27;ve used others and they are too greasy and difficult to get off of hair. My hair is curly but when I use this product I can shape my hair the way I want it.  Not only is this a great product to use but it smells great!!! I definitely recommend this to anyone that has a difficult time shaping their hair the way they want it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product when there is dry weather humidity/sweat is its weakness</li>
    <li> It was a great buy this stuff smells great has an excellent hold and washes out without a waxy residue.</li>
    <li> Great pomade and holds my hair - found THE ultimate pomade.</li>
    <li> Greatest price around for 3 bottles. I told my friends how much I paid and they didn&#x27;t believe me. I had to show them my email receipt.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great price, fast transaction.  Will do business again with!!</li>
    <li> My son has thick, curly, uncontrollable hair. That is, until his barber told him about Suavecito. This stuff is amazing, last all day, and is easy to shampoo out.</li>
    <li> Great hair gel at a great price</li>
    <li> Suavecito is perfect for spiking your hair - it is easy to use and it has a very nice scent.  this is a product that we purchase every three months - the vendor is quick and the packaging is always perfect! If you are a guy that is looking to spike your hair and smell great, Suavecito is your product!  I highly recommend this...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I love this product so much. I saw a positive review on Instagram by someone with a similar hair style and this stuff works. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the absolute shiznit. I have &amp;#34;strong like bull&amp;#34; Mexican hair and the original hold works great. Seriously my hair is boar hair. It&#x27;s like the dudes from Apocalypto but I&#x27;m better looking.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awsome pomade. Nice hold, no shine and good smell. On of the best from what I tryed.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Smells good.  Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> I should have stuck to Firme hold.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Helps form up my thin hair and the effect is good. A little goes a long way if hair is damp. Hands rinse easy and no stickiness afterwards.</li>
    <li> it works good and its easy to use. found it easier to mold my hair than the strong hold.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product, not only for my husband but easy on my little boys as well! Smells amazing btw.</li>
    <li> Great deal, great products</li>
    <li> great product, masculine fragrance, definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Holds that yung hair up</li>
    <li> Works great in my rebel hair and gives that cool slick look. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The hubby loves this stuff.. Great price.. Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> This stuff does the trick. I will say that the fragrance is pretty strong but it makes your hair look great. I have wavy hair and lets me do  side part pomp just fine.</li>
    <li> Suavecito Pomade Original Hold 3-Pack:    PROS: (1) Products as described  (2) Excellent hold - Medium/Firme  (3) Smells like Ajax  (4) Washes out with H2O in seconds  (5) The only animal they test on is a hairy man - as stated on their official website!  (6) Been using this product for over a year and it never disappoints    CONS: None</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there that i know about</li>
    <li> Great value, smells great, washes off easily, holds high and tight.</li>
    <li> Dosent really hold my  hair but shipping is really fast</li>
    <li> Came right on time and now i look goooood! B)</li>
    <li> Great little product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Locally made. Usually about $14 or $15 a tub, which makes this a great value. It shipped quickly, too. Works awesome on thick, stubborn hair. Definitely recommend it if a thick, strong-hold pomade is what your looking for.</li>
    <li> There is no better for the look that&#x27;s wetter.</li>
    <li> All of suavicito products are amazing! My 4 boys love this pomade!</li>
    <li> Keeps my jew-fro looking sharp and sleek!</li>
    <li> Great pomade for your hair, this is one of the best if you want your pomp to hold up all day long. Great price and super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! He won&#x27;t use anything else. He says it holds throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t have that crusty feel that some of the other brands do.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> Nice service and good  product .</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the shine and gripping power of this pomade. No flakes, nothing like that. Only downside, which is why I will not give it 5 stars, is the stuff is actually very sticky, and you need to be able to wash your hands (with soap) after using it. This is in contrast to some other pomades, which are more natural (non-petroleum based) and also serve as moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Good for styling pomps but kinda hard wth thick hair but it is a great product, i would reccomend it and if you live near santa ana, El Catrin Barbershop is the place to go, if you wanna get your pomp or just get a super clean cut, go there, corner of 4th st. and Birch st.</li>
    <li> Just discovered this product a few months ago and it&#x27;s amazing. Get it hombre! Stay dapper.... and take it sleazy.</li>
    <li> I switched from Crew Pomade to this absolutely love this product at almost half the price. Smells great, I have short wavy hair, but this holds exactly how I style it. First I bought 1 to test out, and within a couple days, I ordered a 12 pack. Im not even 1/2 way thru 1 jar in 1 month.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for over a month now and to be honest I&#x27;ve never tried a better hair product Absolutely great for hair styling. I never though my hair could look so good, but this pomade has other ideas. Great buy. A very satisfied customer who will be definitely coming back for more in the future!</li>
    <li> Great product, highly recommended</li>
    <li> I find that this product works very well, molds easily, and holds all day. The pomade has a light fragrance, spreads easily over damp hair, and can be &amp;#34;re-activated&amp;#34; with a bit of water when needed at the end of the day. I&#x27;ve tried gel, mouse, molding putty, and none of them work as well as Suavecito. Kudos to Suavecito on making a great product with a cool name...best used when playing &amp;#34;Suavecito&amp;#34; by Malo in the background.</li>
    <li> Great hold, pleasant odor</li>
    <li> Really dig this product and its a great value. its lasted me almost a year</li>
    <li> Best Pomade I have used</li>
    <li> My so loves, loves, loves this product and we have been through quite a few!</li>
    <li> Genius..... Really good water base pomade... Fixes my hair right the first time with very little of it....</li>
    <li> Great deal, arrives timely.  I love every Suavecito product I have used!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 different kinds of pomade including American Crew, but Suavecito is by far my favorite.  Buy in bulk and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Amazing, the only thing that can hold my weave in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the cartoon character for danny in the begging of grease. That&#x27;s is literally me. Haha it works very well at taming my extremely wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Best everyday pomade there is.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it comes right off with water, unlike other pomades I&#x27;ve used all while giving me the strong hold I need throughout the day.</li>
    <li> product could be better</li>
    <li> Best hair product out there</li>
    <li> holds well but I need the firme hold. I misread it before buying. Still happy. Lol</li>
    <li> Great product! A lot better buying it on Amazon then at the barber. This is my go to pomade and will continue to buy when my supply runs out!</li>
    <li> My son LOVES this stuff.  You save more money buying a 3 pack.</li>
    <li> Great Pomade, washes out easy!</li>
    <li> I really like suavecito its great for clean sleek grooming its now my pomade of choice i like that it feels like goo when i put it in my hair and then it dries up and makes all my hair sleek back and if i ever need to adjust it water works great with it.&lt;br /&gt;Also thank you for the comb with the pomade it helps when i go out</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and i love this stuff to make it seem straight. so easy to use and light on my hair it doesnt leave that hard crust gel feeling but more of a natural feel. i have a hard part and it just is perfect. i will definitely buy  more</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite pomade.  Smells great, lots of hold but washes out easily, and a bargain when bought like this!</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells so good!</li>
    <li> one of the products was damaged. nothing too big</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but I really like the product.</li>
    <li> Everything came on time, product was as eclecticed.</li>
    <li> Im a person that usually isn&#x27;t satisfied very easy and I normally keep on looking for something better, even after finding something I like. It sounds a bit weird, i know. But I dont like to close myself to other products/services. Well, ive done that with this Suavecito pomade. I loved it since the moment I first used it. But being me, I tried other products and not one came close to it. It has very good hold and it has absolutely no oil. You wash it off your hands and hair so easy. It smells great too. Try it, Im absolutely sure you guys will love it like i did. Ive recommended it to friends and family already. Great product!</li>
    <li> All Pomades are not the same! In my opinion Suavecito is one of the better brands out there. It lasts all day and most importantly keeps its hold! The 3 pack is also a better buy. Best bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend once, and I&#x27;ve kept buying it ever since. This time in bulk! He loves the way it holds yet he&#x27;s able to style and re-style his hair and I personally love the smell. I absolutely recommend, great price too!</li>
    <li> Its better if you don&#x27;t wet your hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this pomade. The hold is just right for my hair with a slight sheen to it.  I&#x27;ve tried many a product for my thick curly hair and most fail to hold all day.  Suavecito does it, and does it with perfection.  I like how it easily washes off and doesn&#x27;t feel like you put your hand in glue.</li>
