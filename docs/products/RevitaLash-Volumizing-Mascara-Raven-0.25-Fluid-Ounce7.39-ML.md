    <li> Love this mascara used after the revitalash primer.</li>
    <li> Not as natural looking as I would like.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The BEST mascara on the market! I only use this brand.</li>
    <li> Perfect eyelashes !!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and allergies.  This mascara goes on easily and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Comes off under my eyes.  I prefer a water-proof mascara.  Love their Revitalish Conditioner to make my lashes longer, but will not buy the mascara again.</li>
    <li> One word - WOW! Ladies this product is wonderful. It gives you long, natural looking lashes without clumps.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, nothing else is better than this!</li>
    <li> Always get compliments.  Instantly makes lashed very long. You don&#x27;t notice how good it is until you switch to a different &amp;#34;high rated&amp;#34; mascara.  After using a different mascara, I use this one on the tips.</li>
    <li> This product is quite the opposite from what everyone says. I got mine directly from a distributor and absolutely hate it. I would go for Maybelline or covergirl before I spent full price on this again. It is quite thick, clumpy, and wet. EVERYDAY I have clumps and smudges under my eyes (which I have never had a problem with before) and it is quite embarrassing! The only positive thing I have decided upon is that the tube is more or less a bottomless pit. I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of the stuff, it never runs out! So, a little bit goes a long way but I still recommend saving your money on this one. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It lengthens my lashes without clumpy mascara. I have recommended this product to others and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> These products in 2 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had Eye brows for my daughter weddinf one month from purschas</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara every day but it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> Although it smears easily and is not waterproof I love this mascara . It makes my lashes look long and full.</li>
    <li> Love it! It lengthens my lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. I was expecting to have volumized lash with this mascara, but was terribly disappointed with the look. I noticed no difference in length or volume.  It&#x27;s just a basic overpriced mascara that doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this mascara.  I am an aesthetician and it is one of the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> It is a little watery and I have to let it dry and run a eyelash comb through my lashes to undo the clumping. It will smear on my eyelids if you open your eyes before it dries</li>
    <li> I used it before and I personally like it very much!</li>
    <li> The best mascara I have ever used! Easy on and off and lasts all day. No clumping or under the eye residual at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as any cheaper mascara so I am not super impressed with it. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Used this product in the past love the product. The price was excellent.</li>
    <li> clumpy, not worth the money</li>
