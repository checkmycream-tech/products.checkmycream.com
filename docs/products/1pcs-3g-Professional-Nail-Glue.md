    <li> I am surprised that this product worked so well!&lt;br /&gt;My fake nails stayed on well with this glue for about 2 1/2 weeks. I work in retail and usually I have an issue with my nails coming off after 1 or 2 work days. They even stayed on throughout daily activities without becoming loose. Would definitely re-order when I run out of the first bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Also, this glue doesn&#x27;t have a strong nasty smell like most nail glues do.</li>
    <li> No brush. ..poured over everything. .not n.happy</li>
    <li> Works good the smell is super strong I had nail glue before and this is the strongest smell ever! I recommend wearing a mask.</li>
    <li> If I could give this a lower rating I would. This glue is not even worth the small amount I paid for it. The product is thinner than water and there&#x27;s nothing in the cap to plug the hole from letting it all pour out after it has been opeded. AND the glue takes way too long to dry and does not last for more than a day. Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money, I&#x27;m actually begging you.</li>
    <li> It just come from china. It didn&#x27;t work 2 of them. Funny. What a waste.</li>
    <li> they last a long time but for the first day my nails hurt I don&#x27;t know if it was the nail or the glue but the nails didn&#x27;t hurt before with my other glues</li>
    <li> I had went to using super glue to holding my nails on. This glue is as good as super glue without the damage repeated use of super glue can cause. Will use for awhile and see if it continues to work.</li>
    <li> Hard to work with. Easily glued my fingers together more than once. However, it still did not make little plastic bows stay on my nails.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. It has a poor application at the top when you open it which makes the glue get all over your hands and it&#x27;s really hard to remove from your skin.</li>
    <li> They hold very well and last for around two weeks or more if your careful. Over all it works great.</li>
    <li> this thing is crazier than crazy glue.. never using this again..</li>
    <li> product came earlier than expected, no glue is dried out but the wont come out thru the bottle i had to take the top off and it&#x27;s very difficult to use the glue without the top part to squeeze, wouldnt buy again.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. Great product for not only tips and false nails but also for metal and rhinestone designs.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail glue I have used. It stays for days and the top does not get stuck to the bottle like others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great product... I will be ordering more soon! The product was well worth it! Wish they had a bigger package.</li>
    <li> The top of the bottle was hardened, I had to cut the top off in order to get the rest of the glue, it was pretty good other then the fact that the top was hard. it came on time and was very good :) it hold for a week or so :3</li>
    <li> Sticks very well and is a very good deal for the money. Even works for bigger fashion pieces on nails.</li>
    <li> even for the little amount of money I spent I am still highly disappointed, they sent me a EMPTY bottle. what a joke. spend a few extra dollars and actually get something worth it&lt;br /&gt;this doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star</li>
    <li> This stuff works but after a couple times of using it the cap gets glued to the bottle and you have to hurt yourself to get it off, or do what I do and end up throwing it away.  I ended up trying the brush on glue being skeptical and it works great.</li>
