<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The brush started shedding immediately and the soap did not agree with my sense of smell...I am thinking of other things I can use it for so I wont totally lose on this...</li>
    <li> Love the razor but watch out the blades are very sharp</li>
    <li> The brush is a nice Omega brand brush and the soap is delightful, in a menthol eucalyptus kind of way. And the little plastic brush holder.......holds the brush so it dries between uses (and that extends the life of the brush). Far better than the van der Hagen beginner set.</li>
    <li> Great so far. Everything I expected. My first safety razor blade.</li>
    <li> bought this for someone else.  It was okay. Nothing fancy.  Seal was broken on soap so not usable .  Would not recommend</li>
    <li> My husband wanted an old time brush and soap kit.  He loves it.  I wish there was a top on the soap dish but otherwise it&#x27;s been great.  He had no complaints.</li>
    <li> Love the brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap is creamy and rich - perhaps too rich!  I used it twice in shaving and my face broke out in a red mess. Waited a week and tried it again - same situation!  Kept the brush, threw the soap away!.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for an older gentleman and he loved it. He said he had been looking for a shaving kit like this but could not find one but thanks to Amazon we have made someone very happy. Good job Amazon.</li>
    <li> This si a nice set. The brush is good and the soap smells great. It is a pleasure to apply warm soap to my face before shaving.</li>
    <li> Good soap and nice brush.  Great price</li>
    <li> The order was handled in a professional manner and the service was great. I have since ordered from the vendor.</li>
    <li> The brush is nice, the stand sucks and the soap doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> Got this maybe a year and a half ago and I am still using both the cream and the brush. I don&#x27;t shave daily and actually let a beard grow for a bit but I can actually see the bottom of the shaving cream bowl now. My personal favorite method is to fill the sink with hot water and let the razor and the brush soak in it while I take a shower. The last 2 minutes or so of my shower I hold a hot washcloth on my face in the areas where Im going to shave. Get out, shake off and head to the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squeeze most but not all of the water out of the brush and then swirl it around the cream bowl about 4 or 5 times. Thats it. You really don&#x27;t need much at all to build a good lather. In the beginning I was using way to much; actually was starting to build a lather in the bowl I was using so much. I was then using the lid as a bowl to work the lather up but now I just face lather and place the brush back in the cream to sit. If I need to reapply more cream I lightly dip the tip of the brush into the water and reapply. Does a good job and I have sensitive skin. I can see myself purchasing this cream again although I would like to try something different since its all that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is great. Ill won&#x27;t be replacing it for a long time unless I somehow manage to render it unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great starter set. Cant recommend more. Get yourself a variety pack of blades and see what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning I found Feathers almost impossible to shave with but really liked Astra. Now that I have the technique down Feathers are a dream, and Astra still really smooth. Don&#x27;t start with a feather. Start with a Derby or Astra blade.</li>
    <li> bought as a gift, my brother loves this set</li>
    <li> ACTUALLY ITS NOT TOO BAD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In My Own Experience This Set Is Really A Pretty Neat Deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK The Brush is good tho a bit smaller than many would like, I mean I liked mine and the hairs didn&#x27;t fall out like so many complain of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So My Experience Was A Bit Different!.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soap Im not -Super Fond- of OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers pretty good and I really liked the scent but the bottom line is its &#x27;Not Really&#x27; that effective as a shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I didn&#x27;t really mind the Perfumy Oils as they rather soothed my face but again after pass 2 my face had way too many hairs left for me too be happy with this and I was using a new Astra Blade too tho to be honest my bread is pretty tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is another case of you get what you pay for here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But do remember you can dump the soap and put a better brand in the bowl as it is reusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reminds me a lot of the old Williams shaving soap we used back in the 70s so it will take the hair off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you gotta work at it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuff Said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indiana ED</li>
    <li> since you can find brand product in shops that will cast at least $20 for the shaving cream, $30 for the brush.... all for less than $15... perfect.    I bought that to try, i didn&#x27;t want to invest to much money without knowing if i will like it and continue shaving with a safty razor.    I LIKED IT !    Those razors are great and shave way better than any mac III for cheaper.      If you start or if the budget is tight, go for it it is a good set.   Later on you might like a better brush though.</li>
    <li> I really like the soap, having just tossed my last can of shaving cream I noticed that the soap lather provided a much smoother shave using the same cartridge razor.  I like the stand that holds the brush upright; this should facilitate good drying from what I&#x27;ve read.  I definitely recommend lathering from soap instead of using a can as some airlines may not allow a compressed canister in your luggage.  That being said, the brush doesn&#x27;t seem very durable.  A few bristles fell out the first time I used it.  Good for a starter kit, but later on you&#x27;ll probably want a better brush.</li>
    <li> Decided to get all my guys (DH and 3 DSs) \\&quot;safety razors\\&quot; for Christmas this year.  I got this shave set for each of them.  I figured I would just start them out with something, (this product already had good reviews) and they could change to something else later if they wanted to.  Well, they all love this as well.  It moisturized the face without being too much, not drying, has a nice scent, a little menthol, but nothing overpowering, or mediciny smelling.  My guys are ages 18 to 48, so i can say for the most part, men of a wide age range love it.  The brush is stiff but also soft enough on the face.  We haven&#x27;t noticed hairs falling out of the brush, so i think its pretty good quality.  Also, the soap bowl has a lid on it, which keeps it clean, and keeps it from drying out.  They were all very pleased with this gift and a couple of them immediately shaved with all their new tools.</li>
    <li> The boar brush is nice once you break it in. Well worth the price with the brush stand. I&#x27;m not sure I like the shave soap as much, leaves my face pretty dry afterwards. I thought it was a hard soap when I bought it but it&#x27;s more of a thicker pomade consistency.</li>
    <li> As a new double edge shaver, This is a great starter set..</li>
    <li> As advertised.  This is my first time purchasing a shaving brush.  Seems like good quality.  Soap lathers nicely. Soap kind of smells like noxzema, but not to strong.   I can see my skin clearing up a bit.  Definitely much better than shaving gel in a can.  Only downside is the brush holder, just a piece of flimsy plastic.</li>
    <li> Good price and worked well just didnt like the medicated smell it had...the soap im talking about</li>
    <li> Do not buy this... The brush started falling apart during first use... It is not worth cheaping out on this kit.Just buy quality supplies separately. The soap is ok but everything else with it is cheap and ultimately a waste of money.  This is my first kit and I already have used better quality products and it makes a world of difference.  DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I selected this set for my son who is 17. He loves it and actually enjoys shaving with it. My plan was to order a more exepnsive set if he liked this one, but I really can&#x27;t see the need. It&#x27;s a very nice set.</li>
    <li> This was the first shaving soap and brush that i have bought. I became interested in shaving soaps after i became frustrated with the waste and poor shave quality of aerosol shaving creams. I also liked the masculinity of making my own lather. The soap is wonderful, and feels amazing on your skin, and it gives a very smooth shave. I did not give this product a 5, however, simply because i have nothing else to compare it to. How do i know there isn&#x27;t something better? Anyway, great product overall.</li>
    <li> My first experience with wet shaving, but the set seems to work fine - but I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
    <li> This is very much a starter set for shaving. The brush seems fine (I have no basis for comparison). The soap is cheap. The stand is just a piece of plastic (although any stand is much better than none). If I were to do it again, I&#x27;d buy the same brush/holder set and get different soap. If you&#x27;re committed to the idea of shaving this way, don&#x27;t buy this set.</li>
    <li> Everyone says badger is the way to go.  I&#x27;m not so sure.  Soak a boar hair a bit and it is softer yet has good backbone.  For the price,  there was next to no sheading.  The rebranded Poraso shave soap is also well regarded.  It isn&#x27;t as thick as you might want for straight razor shaving or an aggressive double edge but works great for most double edged razors.  You really can&#x27;t beat the price for this combo either.</li>
    <li> Not overly impressed\ The brush is ok ,good it is from Italy. all in all , a simple  set of plastic.Soap also Ok&lt;br /&gt;price ok.</li>
    <li> Was given this set as a gift. I love it.  The brush is good, the shave cream is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been shaving this way for decades. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas purchase for my son.  I have a few shaving brushes (I really used them when I was in the army, for oiling my weapon) and he has been asking me about getting one.  The brush seems to be good quality, and the soap is good as well.  The holder is thin plastic, so I don&#x27;t expect that to last too long.  This is, however, a starter kit, so if he doesn&#x27;t like it, then it&#x27;s okay b/c it wasn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
    <li> I waited too long to convert to this shaving experience.  Kiss the boring morning (or evening, I guess) aerosol-whipped-cream ritual goodbye.  And the Omega system works perfectly.  The brush smoothly and evenly applies the soap without scratch or tickle, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding of bristles (I mean on the brush, not my beard).  The soap is slightly tinged with menthol and lathers nicely.  &#x27;Pretty incredible price, too, for products that work so well.  &#x27;Great gift!</li>
    <li> Very nice starter shave kit.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set to start with.  The brush is perhaps a little stiff, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.  It has not lost a single bristle yet.  The soap has a pleasant soapy smell.    It lathers well enough, especially considering the low cost.  I could do without the menthol, but at least its not like putting Icy-Hot on your face (i.e. it&#x27;s fairly mild).  The soap contains 4 types of parabens if that sort of thing bothers you.</li>
    <li> I used to swear by Omega&#x27;s shaving soap, but it would seem that they changed the way they make their soap, or the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is an excellent starter brush, not too rough, but still durable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set as part of a present for my boyfriend for our five-year anniversary.  He had been wanting to try a badger hair shaving brush after reading some reviews in a magazine.  However, he had no experience with shaving brushes at all.  I thought that this looked stylish and would be a good way to see if he liked brushes before dropping lots of cash on a badger hair one.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We both really liked the style of the set and also how little space it takes up.  He enjoyed the brush.  However, his skin reacted adversely to the soap.     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suggest this set for other curious shavers, but please buy a different soap if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no superfine silvertip, but this boar&#x27;s hair brush is a workhorse.&lt;br /&gt;The soap included has eucalyptus/mentholated scent.</li>
    <li> Update to my previous message: I wrote to Omega in Italy describing my problem. They asked if the foil on the black cup had a complete and tight seal. It was not tightly sealed and that caused the composition of the soap to change and create my problem. They sent me two toothpaste tubes of the same soap ( pictured below) to replace the soap in the round black container and the difference is like night and day. I really like the Omega shaving soap/cream in the new toothpaste tube packaging and will likely buy more. It reminds me of the Proraso tube-packaged shaving cream that I also use in my soap collection. My problem has been fixed by a responsive Italian company that is truly committed to customer satisfaction.  Previous message: I have two Omega boar brushes that I really like and I bought this kit to use for travel. The brush, stand and clear plastic cup that holds it all together in a compact package is perfect. The included shaving cream was a delightful addition until I tried it. It lathered up well but soon after I used the new brush to apply it using face lathering, my skin began to burn. As I began to shave the irritation got worse. I stopped shaving, washed all the soap off my face and applied two coats of Nivea after shave balm. I do not have &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;. I do not suffer from allergies. I have used a number of shaving soap products and have never had an experience like this with a shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Husband happy with the kit!</li>
    <li> Grandpa loved it. The stand on the brush is perfect so the water wont collect on the brim. The soap smells good too.</li>
    <li> The brush quality is ok. Soap is nice but I have a hard time getting a good lather. Not sure if it&#x27;s the brush or soap. Cheap enough so F it.</li>
    <li> I have recently changed my shaving routine and along with shaving with a DE razor, I am new to shaving with a product that doesn&#x27;t spray out of a can.I have to say I have never had a smoother shave. I can&#x27;t compare this product to any other of its kind but this one works really well</li>
    <li> item was also purchased as a display at entrance into master bath, look great and many remarked about this display</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend.  He loves it so far.  The brush stands on the soap dish which is nice as it saves space.</li>
    <li> The whole kit is a great starter kit for getting into wet shaving.  I will use this until it runs out and then upgrade, but very pleased with this as my starter kit!</li>
    <li> Very nice starter set, quality soap and brush!</li>
    <li> This brush/soap combo is the perfect item for the man who wants a great shave. The soap softens the beard to the point the blade glides over the face. The brush is extremely high quality and comes with a stand to keep it damage free. This is a wonder item, and I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> seems to be a decent set for the beginner.  brush is nice but doesnt seem to hold as much water as some other brushes.  i notice i have to add more water to make a good lather.</li>
    <li> Great soap, very easy on the skin and creates a great lather, the only down side is that you can&#x27;t just order the soap alone after it runs out(which one can lasted me 6 months and I shave 4 times a week)</li>
    <li> I hate it. the brush started losing clumps of bristles in the first use. it smelled worse than a dead animal. the lid on the cream container was cracked and the foil seal on the cream had a small cut in it. and the cream was the the most difficult thing i have yet tried to lather with, okay the first part was my bad i should have given it more time before i reviewed it as both products worked and smelled better after about 4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;good for beginners and experts alike.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my first wet shave. The soap is very effective, smells good, and gives a good lather. The brush seems to get the job done. It may be my inexperience with this kind of product, but hairs occasionally fall out of the brush and this seems that this would indicate it is a lower quality product. Also, I&#x27;m a pretty big guy and the handle feels small in my hand. Despite these minor issues, I am fairly satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> durable. great for the price. with proper care will last a long time. Some shedding occurs early on , but than stabilizes and softens beautifully.</li>
    <li> I am new to wet shaving. This kit was a pefect way for me to get started. It comes with a boar hair brush, stand, and soap. The stand is nice to have. It sits perfectly on top of the soap bowl and I understand it prolongs the life of the brush. The brush is much better than I expected. It holds plenty of moisture, works up a great whipped-cream like lather and it is nice and soft. I experienced the shedding of three hairs on the first use and there has been no shedding since. I think those hairs were already loose. The soap has a nice smell of eucalyptus. The lid of the soap bowl serves as a lather bowl and works fairly well; however I have started to use a separate bowl that is a bit bigger and deeper. The soap is cushiony and silky and the amount of soap is substantial and should last many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy and I highly recommend it. If the brush starts falling apart or anything like that I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for a friend. can&#x27;t really comment on it.</li>
    <li> horrible soap lousy brush and cheap plastic stand.</li>
    <li> Nice kit but I don&#x27;t care for the soap.</li>
    <li> the brush is great but the cream was okay only because i didnt like all the artificial ingredients and preservatives on there like SLS, parabens, etc</li>
    <li> love it! just wait until you use it,lots more smooth than cans of shaving cream,buy it you will like it</li>
    <li> A nice set soap is good quality and brush covers well. stand and soap bowl balance on each other in cprner of sink area for display.</li>
    <li> I used this several times, it doesn&#x27;t seem to lubricate my skin well enough and I get a lot of nicks when shaving. If I use regular soap, it works great.  I&#x27;ve tried it more than once, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. It smells nice and the brush works well, it&#x27;s just the soap that doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> HARD brush. Spend a little more and get a silvertip badger brush. This isn&#x27;t even nice for a beginner.</li>
    <li> Hubby loved this Christmas present. Me too, it smells amazing! Now I need to give him more room in the bathroom cabinet.</li>
    <li> About five months ago, I decided to get rid of the multi-blade, disposable razors and go back to the basics.  I wasn&#x27;t ready to&lt;br /&gt;try the straight razor, but went to a single-blade, double-edged razor.  I got a 40-blade sampler from Amazon and the Omega shaving set to go with it.  I&#x27;m pleased with all my purchases.  I love the Omega shaving cream.  The brush and holder work quite well and I&#x27;ve had no problem with losing bristles.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> First time safety razor use this is a great set for beginners I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Smooth shave, leaves great feeling, and no cans to trash!! Brush holder could have been a bit more robust.</li>
    <li> Works like I figured it would.  Had a bit of a smell at first.  Took a few shaves for the smell to go away.</li>
    <li> The soap smells good and it lathers up pretty quick.  Another review suggested soaking the brush a bit in warm water to help soften it a bit and that works very well.  Depending on the amount of water in the brush you will get a thicker (with less water) or thinner (more water) lather.  Expect to lose some bristles the first few times using the brush but mine hasn&#x27;t lost any in the last month or so now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again if I ever need to replace the soap or brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
    <li> When I received this I did not open soon, while on vacation open and tried to use, I am not sure exactly how to use the cream or whatever that is--NO instruction enclosed to explain anuything--you&#x27;re on your own</li>
    <li> Great product and speedy delivery</li>
    <li> This is my first brush and the only soap that I have used. I am not able to simulate the lather that I have seen online, but its still sufficient. Smells good and little tug when shaving.</li>
    <li> As the subject reads, the soap in bowl produces the the best lather I have used.  The brush does a vey good job of raising the lathe.  Does Omega make the same quality in a tube?  Would be great fo plane travel</li>
    <li> And a vintage Gillette super speed. He loves the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; on his face from the menthol eucalyptus soap. Also a boar brush is great for a beginner as these fibres will keep a decent amount of back bone while the tips will continue to get very soft (so long as it is properly shaken out and dried. )</li>
    <li> My wife gave me this set as a gift when I expressed interest in wet shaving. I want to stop using ecologically destructive, energy-wasting canned shaving creams. I&#x27;ve used this set for several days. I definitely like the soap; it feels good on my face. I am not bothered by the eucalytpus content of the soap or the smell of eucalyptus. And the experience of shaving in multiple passes (2 or 3 complete lathering and shaves right after showering) feels so good that I want to continue wet shaving. The brush included with this set is okay for the price. It is not a high-end Edwin Jagger or Simpson&#x27;s brush. The handle is about the right size for my small hands. The knot size of the brush seems a little small and the loft seems a bit small too. That means the brush can&#x27;t hold much water. The bristles don&#x27;t look like badger hair to me, they look a bit synthetic. It seems hard to load them with soap properly, but this could be because I&#x27;m unskilled with a brush and need more practice. The product description does not seem to specify what the brush hair is made of. The main effect of getting this set is to start me on my journey of learning how to wet shave. There is a huge variety of soaps, creams, brushes and shaving razors out there if you are interested enough to look around. This set is at the low end of the price spectrum. It does offer you a comfortable shave (and definitely a more comfortable shave than if you use canned soaps bought from the grocery store.) The more comfortable shave stems primarily from learning how to load soap into the brush and then build a rich lather, either in a bowl or on your face. There are several techniques. The comfortable shave could become much more comfortable still -- with continued practice and better tools. To learn more about wet shaving, I&#x27;m following the tutorials on [...] for building a really good lather. There are also YouTube videos available starring mantic59 showing how to do a traditional wet shave and how to build a lather. I hope to improve my lather building technique with more practice. I probably need another 3 weeks just to get that right. It does look like I will need to replace the brush with something better. If you give this set as a gift, do be aware that it is a good starter set, but may well also make the recipient want to learn more about wet shaving and become exposed to the different tools used for wet shaving. Don&#x27;t feel offended if this happens. It is a sign of a healthy interest in learning how to shave well and enjoy the act, rather than how to quickly shave once daily and be done with it. For example I want to keep my lather warm between shaving passes, and I learned that one needs a shaving scuttle for that.r. I hope to improve my lather building technique with more practice.

    <li> My Husband seems to love it :)</li>
    <li> I have tried about five times to make a lather with the soap and brush.  The&lt;br /&gt;results are a thin cream like lather similar to house paint.</li>
    <li> I bought this set when my current brush I use to shave started to give out, perhaps from doing something wrong or being a cheap brush I don&#x27;t know.  So I got this set in today used it like I would a normally wet shave and I noticed that it was burning my skin a little bit.  It wasn&#x27;t that bad so I finished up the shave and afterwards my face would just not stop burning till about 15 minutes later.  Even after using my post shave lotion my ace burned and was exceptionally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I look on the ingredients and see this: Aqua,Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid,Cocos Nucifera, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Myristic Acid, PEG-150, Distearate, Jojo-ba wax, Parfum, Benzyl Alcohol, Tetra Sodium EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am not going to pretend I know what half of these are but I know that this is a lot of stuff a shave soap doesn&#x27;t need.  I admit that I have sensitive skin, but that is why I wet shave in the first place.  This shave creme might as well be some gel out of an aerosol can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely cannot recommend to anyone that has sensitive skin or that doesn&#x27;t want this amount of chemical junk on their face.</li>
    <li> Gives me a good lather - If you&#x27;re new to brush and bowl shaving give yourself a little practice on being patient with the bowl and brush, simply to keep it from getting messy.  Feels good on the skin.  Leaves a nice subtle fresh clean smell.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to use a safety razor for awhile and this product gives you a chance to renew your interest in a close shave. It&#x27;s economical relative to the can stuff, and once you  get use to using a straight razor or safety razor, the shave you get will be much better than the expensive safety razors.</li>
    <li> The soap is pretty good in this kit and it lasts forever. (and it smells nice) The brush does its job alright, but it doesn&#x27;t hold water great and it takes a really long time to break in. (it&#x27;s boar bristle, not badger) For the same price or less you could get the Tweezerman badger hair brush and a bar of shave soap that will end up being a better deal for the money.</li>
    <li> Had never tried using a brush or soap before.  Tried this one because it was so reasonably priced.  I can only imagine what the more expensive brushes and soaps must be like.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the foam dispensers.  This product is well worth the money and you couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my brother&#x27;s birthday.  The brush is a little stiff but its good quality.  Very good set for a beginner into the world of wetshaving.  The shave is superior and better than hacking your skin with a mach 4.  The cream really leaves your face smooth and fresh.  There is a learning curve when it comes to wetshaving but its worth it and less expensive.</li>
    <li> The brush is very high quality. Didn&#x27;t smell badly at all, which is a problem with other boar-hair brushes from what I&#x27;ve heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap has a scent to it. It&#x27;s not all that strong, but it surprised me at first. The scent is pleasant. Works well for irritation and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a fantastic product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought the Omega shaving set for my husband as a gift. He has enjoyed using it several times a week. I gives him a nice close shave and I enjoy the rewards.</li>
    <li> Basically it is good, but the bowl should be a cup...with a handle, then it would be great. Easy change to make.</li>
    <li> Excellent products for the cost. The brush is of higher quality and the soap works well.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brush and soap set.  The brush holder really does help the brush dry out well.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Brush foams up quickly and feels great on the skin.  Cleans easily and dries out in it&#x27;s own holder. Quality soap allows for a clean, close shave.</li>
    <li> I have just started wet shaving and I shave my head. This kit is good for starters. The brush is not the best, the soap is great, and the brush holder is a necessity. This is the second kit I have purchased, different brands, both are perfect for getting started at a good price.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I&#x27;m sure it could be softer, but I appreciate just a little firmness when applying the shaving foam to my face.  The price was great and it came with a pot of good (not amazing) shaving soap with a nice menthol scent.  Works great, the simple plastic stand is perfect for drying; unbeatable for the price.&lt;br /&gt;If you shave without a brush now, it&#x27;s a much nicer experience and takes almost no extra time.  Also my shaving creme goes a lot farther, so i think this brush will pay for itself in less than a year</li>
    <li> This was my first kit for wet shaving when I started last year. It would be hard to find a better basic kit for a better price in my opinion. The soap lathers up really nice, smells great, and seemed to last forever. You can make your lather right in the bowl it comes in, which I enjoy. The brush is a decent quality boar brush. Sure, you can get a better brush, but if you&#x27;re just starting out and aren&#x27;t sure if wet shaving is for you, this is plenty good enough. I have still yet to purchase a more expensive brush, as this one has held up quite well. It doesn&#x27;t hold water great, so I usually have to re-wet it in between passes. It does shed a bit when I create my lather in the bowl, but since I&#x27;m still not super experienced, it could be my technique is too rough. The brush holder is just a little plastic stand, so while not exceptionally attractive, it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Great brush and lather if you&#x27;re starting out. Lathers easy, smells nice, lasts a long time. Brush is decent quality. Good value kit.</li>
    <li> The wet shaving experts advise to shop around for blades and soaps etc  I must say the wisdom has panned out for me by trying several products I have found the match for me. This was a great deal and this kit has a soap that suits me  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> The soap has a nice sent that isn&#x27;t too over powering and a decent boar hair brush. This is a nice entry set for those thinking of wet shaving with a brush.</li>
    <li> My husband loved his new shaving set!</li>
    <li> Was looking for an inexpensive brush stand and sadly got what I paid for. Stand constructed of the flimsiest plastic and a poor fit for the provided brush. Reminded of the adage &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;. Have not tried the soap so no comments on that.</li>
    <li> This is a great set at an affordable price. No problem with the brush at all. The bristles lather well and feel great on my face.</li>
    <li> This set is really quite good for the price, The soap is fantastic lathers up really thick and smells pretty good just a hint of sandalwood, the brush is the perfect stiffness to get under my beard but not scratch me up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my hubby for Christmas. He likes the old school shaving stuff, so I thought this would be cool. He likes it a lot. The packing was great, the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift. My brother said he loves it, so I purchased one for my husband too.</li>
    <li> The soap itself is great. The cup and brush stand are cheap plastic. The brush started losing bristles right away. The picture on the box gives the impression that the brush stand goes on top of the cup. Super glue is required to keep it there.</li>
    <li> It was my first actually wet shaving and I decided that I was going to purchase an inexpensive kit to get myself started. I purchased an Open - Box Omega Shaving kit all for around 10 bucks, and it included the Omega Soap, Bush, and Bush Stand. Since I&#x27;m an ameture i&#x27;m not sure exactly how good this bush is however it felt extremely good against my face, and the soap smelled quite nice and didn&#x27;t burn or leave my face smelling like crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I believe this is a great little gift/kit for first time wet shavers and the added stand is quite a nice piece.</li>
    <li> My husband was  very impressed with this product and loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought my first one 5 years ago and have never needed to replace it. Since then, I&#x27;ve purchased 3 more for friends and they all love them. It&#x27;s a good deal and the soap included isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  As advertized with quick delivery.  Fine quality.</li>
    <li> The brush and stand for this shaving kit are great. I bought this as my first shaving brush and have been enjoying it so far. The shaving soap isn&#x27;t my favorite since it isn&#x27;t as slick when compared to more expensive shaving soaps, but it definitely gets the job done. Overall, this is a good shaving set and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is meant to be a starter set, and I believe it fills that role nicely.  The brush is great and is the reason this kit is a good deal (I also got an outstanding price of under $11 that was only available for a few days, so I jumped on it).  It sheds a few bristles at first like pretty much all brushes, but then settles in within a couple days.  The stand is cheap and simple, but does the job and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on the counter.  The soap lathers fine.  It&#x27;s consistency is like rubberized goo, and not really a solid soap, but this allows you to conform it to the size/shape of your bowl easily (if you use a separate bowl).  I would definitely recommend to the guy looking to enter the world of wet shaving, especially if you can get it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  After more than a year of trying badger brushes and many other soaps, I no longer consider this to be a &amp;#34;starter set&amp;#34;.  For me, its the ONLY set.  I know opinions vary, but I like the boar brushes over the badger, and the Omega soap is what I keep going back to.  The only thing that is &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; about this set is the brush stand.  It is very basic and you&#x27;ll want a better one that will also hold your razor.  The price of this set has gotten crazy though (nearly 40 bucks!).  If you are paying more than 20 bucks or so for this, just buy the soap and brush separately.</li>
    <li> This is a great started package for DE shaving. I made the mistake of buying additional soap because I thought the bowl would be empty. It wasn&#x27;t, a nice surprise!</li>
    <li> Great set for traveling &amp; using at the gym after a workout.</li>
    <li> Great for the price but was glad I moved on to better quality stuff. I still use the brush as a my &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; brush.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I got it for my adult grandson and he loved it, and me for getting it for him!</li>
    <li> Using a brush to lather my face is a new experience. I have softer sking and my shave feels wonderful</li>
    <li> Quote frankly I hate shaving! Always looking for a way to make it easier and found it with the brush and soap! AWESOME  doesnt do it justice! Still not saying I love shaving, but I do love the Omega soap and brush. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to open the tub of shaving soap at first, until I accidently squeezed it and the top popped off!  Get this!</li>
    <li> Even though I shave every day, I haven&#x27;t put much thought about the products that I use.  Disposable shavers and cheap shaving cream have sufficed.  Using this shaving set is a big step up from my old way of shaving, and the brush and soap are high quality.  The best part is I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune either.  As a bonus, the soap seems to last a long time!</li>
    <li> It works; I&#x27;ve found that the canned gel still works better.</li>
    <li> Old school shaving awesome.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy shaving with this soap and brush combo. The soap has a great refreshing scent and gives an invigorating cooling effect because of the menthol. It is easy to lather, and provides good protection and moisturizes well. The brush whips up a great lather, but when using on the face it is a little stiff. After use, it does seem to have softened up some. Overall, I am very satisfied with these items!  7 Year Edit: Over the past 7 years, this little brush has softened up quite nicely. It still retains great backbone and has no problems standing up stubborn whiskers. It is the most magnificent face-lathering brush I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried a half dozen other brushes - mostly pure or silver-tip badger, and much more expensive. But, I keep coming back to this brush. I used it exclusively for about 6 months and then a week ago tried one of my badger hair brushed again - I immediately returned to this brush. Changed my review to 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This set is a quality item and works well. No problems/regrets.</li>
    <li> Ends up as more of a hassle than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my uncle whose from the old school and likes to shave with a razor. He&#x27;s enjoying it very well. He likes the soap that came with it gives a good lather.</li>
    <li> Great kit, for a good price you get a brush and enough soap to last... well I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve really gotten that far into the container and I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks now. Love the smell of the soap and it seems to do the business.</li>
    <li> I have been a classic wet shaver for many years.  I started with badger brushes and expensive creams. I have a rather large collection of brushes and soaps. Out of my collection of brushes I have three favorites.  A $130 Italian silver-tip badger, an $85 Rooney silver-tip and my Omega boar.  I love my Omega, especially with soaps.  The secret is to soak it in hot water before you get in the shower.  Boar takes a little longer to absorb lots of water and also to soften up so as not to break off bristles.  It&#x27;s WELL worth the wait.  Very soft yet scrubby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Omega soap, well there is none. This is re-branded Italian Prorasso.  I have no idea why companies like Omega and Bed bath and Beyond want to re-brand this famous and amazing soap. It is one of the best out there. They should proudly offer it as Prorasso.  It has all of the features of more expensive soaps and is affordable. Bursts into lather, slick and cushiny lather.  Rinses off well and has a refreshing mentholated tingle.  Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a set, anyone wanting to get into this method of shaving or just looking for the best priced and quality starter kit for a gift should get this.  Pair it with a [[ASIN:B000QYEK88 Merkur 34C Heavy Duty]] and a [[ASIN:B0038KA5RC Variety Pack of Blades]] and you have the perfect intro into wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
    <li> and the brush is still serving me well, more than a year later.  I can count on one hand how many times I&#x27;ve had to deal with bristles coming off onto my face.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this! I got it for him as a gift and his face has never been softer after shaving.</li>
    <li> Nothing exceptional about this product. It takes a while to get a good lather, but once there is, it goes on my face well. The brush like in other reviews isn&#x27;t that great. It is a little too coarse for my liking. I&#x27;m sure there are more options in the market. My advice is look around for a better brush, the soap is good but i actually just started using a regular bar of soap and it works fine. that&#x27;s just my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer* This is My Mother&#x27;s Account. She bought it for me, She is not using this product, i don&#x27;t think....</li>
    <li> The brush is stiff and the soap doesn&#x27;t last too long. The brush holder is cheap plastic but does the job and takes little room on the shelf.</li>
    <li> The brush is actually really nice, I like the handle, it fits well in my hand.  The soap is nice, has a menthol smell to it.</li>
    <li> soap is mediocre. nice smell bad sudz.&lt;br /&gt;brush loses bristles often.&lt;br /&gt;Great entry level product otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i needed for more words to meet requirements of posting</li>
    <li> like the shaving soap and brush very much. think my skin looks and feels better compared to foams and glad that I am eliminating some of the aerosol cans going in the land fill</li>
    <li> I had used a brush and shaving soap a while back but dropped it.  I decided I wanted to get back to it because it is just so much nicer than canned shaving cream (more enjoyable experience and better shave).  This set was a nice place to get started and back into it.  The brush is good quality, it feels and works well, the stand is nice as well though I wish it was a little taller (the bristles just barely touch the counter).  The soap creates a nice lather and I got a great shave out of it.  I have fairly sensitive skin and wound up with some irritation, so maybe not the best for sensitive necks (I switched to the Proraso sensitive skin soap).  I would definitely recommend this with the caution about sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The smell is great. A citrus and eucalyptis  smell. Lathers great and fast but not as good as GEO Trumper products. Brush is constanly losing bristles every time I use it. But I can sauy the brush applys the lather great the stand is helpful. Will not buy again. I say buy just the cream and get a different brush.</li>
    <li> Good, solid brush. It&#x27;s a good starter brush. My complaint is the soap. The eucalyptus smell is a little unpleasant, it smells like medicine. The soap leathers fairly well, but doesn&#x27;t smell good. I use it now and then just because I bought it and I don&#x27;t want to waste it. But I&#x27;ve moved on to better soaps that smell and lather better. 2.5 stars if I could give it.</li>
    <li> This shaving set is a great value.  The brush has an initial smell as all natural brushes do.  The brush just gets better as you use it.  I really prefer this to a low end badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave cream gets bad reviews with people irritated they changed the formula.  This is the first time I used it so here is my impression.  It is a glycerine type soap.  Strong eucalyptus smell, pleasant not overpowering.  Loads easily as it is fairly soft.  Lathers well.  Good lubrication for razor blade and seems to soften hair well.  Overall it is a very good shave soap.</li>
    <li> laathers good for a nice shave.</li>
    <li> This was not worth the money I paid for it. The brush was not a good quality, to soap dish was plastic and gave less lather than bar soap. You can get a better product at Walmart for a third of the cost.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a reserve to my regular Omega brush, which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a touch smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s fine as a reserve, and I think will be pressed into service as a travel brush, where small is better. (but it&#x27;s hogs hair, which won&#x27;t dry as quickly as synthetic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving soap is fantastic, I will be buying this stuff again. A few swirls with a wet brush, and then it whips up for a three pass shave, each time on a wet face, so it is going to gradually get watered down, but it hold out fantastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God package overall, I am not sure if I&#x27;d buy again or get the soap and a ful size brush separately, but it would also make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> First of all, the shaving soap I received was NOT the same as the shaving soap pictured. I received something that looked more like Vicks vapor rub. However, instead of returning the product, I deceided to give it a try. I like the product at first, but in time it seemed I couldn&#x27;t get a good lather. The soap was &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; on my face. Resulting in a less than smooth shave. The brush has been great. I&#x27;ve had the kit for a couple of months now and have lost about 5 bristles. I will be moving on from this soap hoping to find a much smoother shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this set two years ago, having never used a shaving brush before. I use it daily and, based on its usage to date, I expect to get another five years out of the original soap. This product deserves six stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my boyfriend who had not used one of these before. He said he loves it and it makes a great lather. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice set.  1st time using a brush and it was very good.</li>
    <li> Excellent starter kit... Clean smelling soap and Brush lathers well. Price is fair.. Quick Shipping..</li>
    <li> Rather disappointed in this set.  I bought a simliar set (soap, bowl, brush) from a different manufacturer and it is much better than this set.  This set&#x27;s main probblem for me is the brush, which is rather stiff and of lower quality than the other set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think its a fair value but there are better options available for a few dollars more.</li>
    <li> bought this to start my BFF off on wet shaving.  the brush is a smaller version of the omega pro boar and the soap is a nice menthol/eucalyptus blend that lathers more than adequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the brush, like all boar brushes, requires some use to break in.  dont judge it off your first few uses.  use it for a few weeks and youll notice that it will soften up and develop lots of split ends and flyaways.  this is preferred, dont think its defective.  for your best results soak the brush in hot water for 8-10 minutes before shaving to soften it up and hydrate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ditch the aerosol and stop shaving with air!</li>
    <li> Two very very good examples of Italian shaving products. The boar brush hits far beyond it&#x27;s simple station in life. And the Omega (Proraso) shave croap is a fine slick protective layer on the face which builds quickly and easily in this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And oh, if you didn&#x27;t know... boar brushes get better with use. Remember to soak it in hot water before use.</li>
    <li> I know this will sound crazy, but I use this product with my electric shaver. See... with things like this that require such tight focus or fine detail, I am hopelessly meticulous. Every morning I shave, I strive  in hope that it is &amp;#34;the ultimate&amp;#34; - in closeness, comfort, and the result is uniform and silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought what I consider to be my &amp;#34;current best&amp;#34; electric shaver last year, a Panasonic wet/dry model. I have used many, many, razors - and shavers over the years, (being in my 50&#x27;s now). I went from &amp;#34;the blade&amp;#34;, to the multi-blade razor, to lubricating strip multi-blade razors, to electrics -  rotary and cutting block types. I have used Norelco, Braun, blah blah blah. This Panny is my best find so far. It will shave wet or dry - and it will leave your entire face to pass &amp;#34;the credit card test&amp;#34;. But that&#x27;s the tool, let&#x27;s get down to cases: &amp;#34;The Lube&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I also tried all &amp;#34;the lubes&amp;#34; - from the old &amp;#34;Noxema&amp;#34; my dad used, to lotions, gels, and even some hybrid concoctions I mixed up, in between. I found that if I really wanted a nice, &amp;#34;treat-yourself&amp;#34; special experience - the shave has to be&amp;#34; wet&amp;#34; -  to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, what we all look for - is like what you get at one of those true old time barber shops, where the blue/red stripes are spinning outside and the straight razor is lapping the leather strap while that steaming hot towel softens your face. All this is occurring as you recline back in the chair in sheer relaxation. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well for me, that is reduced to an after-shower hot water face wash, the best shave cream I can find, and careful shaving with my clean/sharp electric shaver. (I demand that feeling that Al Pacino expressed while smacking his cheeks in &amp;#34;Scent of a Woman&amp;#34; - &amp;#34;ooohh Mama!&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all the gels and creams I tried still leave something to be desired. You have to really &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; them on your face to get them to blossom into their maximum lather. Then you &amp;#34;hope&amp;#34; they are enough to soften, lube, and stand up the bristles for the blade to cut, and then &amp;#34;hope&amp;#34; the benefit lasts long enough, (without degrading or drying out). Some are too thick, some too thin, but none seemed perfect for the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While cruising Amazon.com I stumbled onto this Omega set. Reading some old timer reviews by men who had obvious experience, knowledge, and expertise with straight-razor shaving, I got the idea that if they liked it - and it works for them, why not use it with my electric? After all, it&#x27;s the lube we&#x27;re discussing - not really the shaver. I understand there is a connection, but I gave it a try (and regardless of the risk of being called out for a tasteless match of old and new......here are the results I enjoyed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the technique communicated by one reviewer and pre-soaking the brush in hot water, I step out of the shower, re-wet my face with hot water and dab the wet brush in the soap. Achieving the rich lather consistency desired, I apply it to my face nice and thick. Then shave as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works like no cream or gel ever did. Its so soapy, thick, and perfectly formulated that it holds where you put it, but more than that - its fine lubricating properties remain at their peak throughout the entire shave. It is superior in its softening action, standing up the bristles, and a quick/standard &amp;#34;following-up&amp;#34; stroke (with your free hand sliding over your skin) detects what&#x27;s left to do - as well as how &amp;#34;baby-hiny smooth&amp;#34; those completed portions are. After the shave I rinse off, towel dry and feel refreshed and ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I rinse out the brush and let it air dry in its holder. Replace the soap cover and I am ready for next time. I may not shave this way everyday - due to time. But when I want to treat myself to the closest, smoothest and most comfortable shaving experience a guy can have in his own bathroom - I use my Omega set.  The &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; is nice for those like myself, who have none of its components yet and need a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of your shaving &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; preference, I can recommend it as your lube - and suggest you enjoy it - as proper gentlemen!</li>
    <li> This is my first set so nothing to compare to yet. Brush works fine and stand comes in handy. Next set I might get one with a connected place to hang razor. The soap has good smell. Have bought a few more cheaper old school soaps and so far this one has best smell and creates good lather. I use the lid to make my lather and then rinse it off when done. Happy with this purchase and great price.</li>
    <li> Hubby said the brush is nice and soft but dense enough to lather up. not too fond of the soap although it does lather up thick and firm</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase for me at a really reasonable price. First I like the Boar brush, I definitely prefer Boar to the more commonly liked Badger brushes. It is just firm enough for my tastes and has hardly lost any bristles. It did have a slight smell at first, but gradually disappears and is completely gone after about 2 weeks of daily use. Second, I really like the shaving soap, more like a cream, with the Eucalyptus smell and the great lather and lubrication.  This is my go to shaving soap. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Very good shaving set for the price! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A nice starter kit for safety razor shaving.  The shaving soap is easy to work with, makes a nice foam and has some menthol for a nice tingle.  The brush seems to be decent and the holder is a good touch.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful, really! Having shaved for decades with an old worn out &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; brush, it is so nice to use a moderately stiff brush that does an excellent job of setting up my beard for its morning shave. The brush quickly fills with lather and easily covers my face with a very nice shaving media. If I had only got the brush I would say what a wonderful deal, but the shaving soap included (along with a brush stand and a sorta shaving bowl) is outstanding. It provides a very smooth interface between the blade and my face and smells wonderful. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great for a first time user. This lathers very well. Smells great</li>
    <li> nice shave set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros- nice name brand, brush is great  and soap is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons-soap is hard to lather up</li>
    <li> The product is great. The brush is high quality and the stand is quite sturdy. I would highly recommend this item especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I am a beginner with strait razor shaving. I love this product. The soap is a cream that lathers up well.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the brush and the smell of the soap.  Unfortunately, the soap is a little more difficult to lather than my other shave soaps.  I am glad that I purchased this set, but will not be buying Omega soaps in the future.  My next brush will be an upgraded boar brush manufactured by Omega.</li>
    <li> Have been using for approx -4 weeks.Brush is nice and soft although havent been able to open the shaving cream lid. Difficult to get a good grip as container keeps slipping with wet hands.</li>
    <li> Brush is good for a cheaper brush. I prefer soap over the gel but thought I would try it. It&#x27;s okay, but I still prefer soap.</li>
    <li> This is awesome stuff!!!! it was here by the due date and everything! My dad absolutely loved his gift! Thanks! :)</li>
    <li> I gave the set  to my son as a gift,with a Parker Straight Edge Sharpette,He Loves It...!!</li>
    <li> Not bad but the brush isn&#x27;t as good as I thought. It tends to clump when lathered unlike the old cheap Walmart brush I had (that fell apart eventually).</li>
    <li> Great for thick soaps\creams. Soap that comes with has a strong mint smell.</li>
    <li> I could not believe how quickly I recieved this set.  The brush is great and it also has a plastic stand, which I would have preferred it to be stainless steel, but for the price I could not complain.  And the shaving soap is fantastic.  I have been using a brush for many years and I have found that the cheaper brands of soap work much better than the more expensive brands.  More lather and less work.  But this soap lathers up very quickly and has a nice manly smell to it.  I would recommmend this product to my friends anythime.  I give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;Pete</li>
    <li> My complaint about this package is due to the poor brush quality and the fact that the soap gave me a skin rash</li>
    <li> Great starter set for the price. I recommend this for anyone interested in trying traditional shaving. If you are an experienced wet shaver the soap is great but the brush is mediocre.</li>
    <li> The brush got moldy super quickly and we had to throw it out...</li>
    <li> this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Brush is a little stiff at first. The soap smells good and gives lots of lather.</li>
    <li> This kit + Merkur long handle &#x3D; Awesome shave.</li>
    <li> For the money, an outstanding buy!</li>
    <li> Product is great quality.  I bought it for my son and he couldn&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the soap, brush and the holder!</li>
    <li> Keep in mind this review is coming from a shaving novice, so take this info with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Soap lathers well&lt;br /&gt;- Brush isn&#x27;t too harsh on the face&lt;br /&gt;- Cheapest option&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Brush bristles coming off, frayed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be just that I am a beginner, but this brush seems to be kinda cheap. The bristles are fraying and coming off (even though I&#x27;m not too hard on it. It doesn&#x27;t really hold the creme very well either. Again, this is probably due - at least in part - to my lack of experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, you can&#x27;t beat that price (especially considering the amount of money you can spend on some higher end shaving equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking to upgrade from this, but not for a while. Overall, it gets the job done and I would recommend it to any beginner in straight shaving.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband as a gift. He loves it and thinks it was a great purchase for the cost.</li>
    <li> Flimsy plastic.  The bowl isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s pictured, it&#x27;s just a tub with a lid.  The picture on the box?  Forgetaboutit... it does not fit into the lid at all.  If you turn the bowl upside down, it&#x27;ll fit precariously into the dimple there, but that&#x27;s about it.  The brush holder is truly flimsy and quite disappointing.  I haven&#x27;t used the brush or soap yet, but can only HOPE that it will be remotely as good as folks here say it is.  I was expecting a bit more from the Italians who manufactured this product.  I should&#x27;a just bought the Parker brush w/stand and a good bowl.  This is really a serious waste of your money at $22.</li>
    <li> I like it but the blades only last for  one shave,</li>
    <li> Husband loves it. The soap is perfect.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this. The soap has makes the hair stand up better for a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Unlike some other product reviews this little set worked well and the brush  is still intact.&lt;br /&gt;David S.</li>
    <li> Great products for the low price. Nice brush with comfortable feel and a handy stand for it. Soap lathers well and leaves skin feeling softened and smooth, with a mild but pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> The brush works great. Package cam as described.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving soap is okay. Have trouble getting the consistency I want.</li>
    <li> My husband casually mentioned one day that he would like to try shaving with a brush, so I bought this for him for Chritmas. His very first shave with it he came out of the bathroom raving about how great it was. His job requires him to be clean shaven, and this has given him the closest shave I&#x27;ve seen on him in the 18 years we&#x27;ve been together. His face is soft and just very clean looking. Very glad I chose this brand for him.</li>
    <li> Gift for teenager.  He really liked it. (his words)</li>
    <li> I got these for my groomsmen and they have all used it and liked it.</li>
    <li> Great for starters learning to straight razor shave. Badger brush and lather is good too for just a regular razor shave</li>
    <li> I have had mine for almost a year now and it still works just fine now! Great starter kit!</li>
