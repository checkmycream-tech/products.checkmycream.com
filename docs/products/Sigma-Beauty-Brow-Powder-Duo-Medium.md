### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>BEST BROW POWDER EVER</li>
      <li>but the MEDIUM is PERFECT!!  </li>
      <li>The lighter side is PERFECT for the front of the brown!!</li>
      <li>Perfect color for burnettes.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect.</li>
      <li>Best brow product I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>The lighter shade is perfect to fill in sparse areas, and the darker color is perfect to fill in some patches (I have a scar on my eyebrow and do not grow any hair there).  </li>
      <li>Loved it!</li>
      <li>Get yourself a good eyebrow brush and you will be very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Really nice product and the color was the perfect shade for my brows.</li>
      <li>Lol</li>
      <li>would not buy again just based on the price and because there are cheaper, good quality alternatives out there.</li>
      <li>Its so cute im keeping the box lol .</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The price is amazing because Sigma appreciates it&#x27;s customers and there things do not cost a fortune to make.  </li>
      <li>As always, Sigma does an amazing job with shipping and packaging.  </li>
      <li>Love love love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the one of the best I have tried so far.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and stays put!</li>
      <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
      <li>cute packaging.</li>
      <li>Omg i love it .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like eye shadow, it smears.</li>
      <li>Love this duo.  </li>
      <li>The powder has a nice feel andgoes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this brow powder.</li>
      <li>I also love that it&#x27;s a creamy powder.</li>
      <li>but i think this ones better .</li>
      <li>Perfect shade for a blonde.</li>
      <li>I would say more like black/brown.</li>
      <li>The dark color is a perfect neutral brown, and the more you apply the darker you can make it.  </li>
      <li>In my honest opinion, Sigma&#x27;s powder brow products are far better than Anastasia&#x27;s in price, quality and staying power.  </li>
      <li>Love the powder but these brows are jacked up so it doesn&#x27;t look right yet.</li>
      <li>I love it, its exactly what i wanted.</li>
      <li>Looks more natural!</li>
      <li>These colors are just right for my hair snd skin tone.</li>
      <li>I use the powder less frequently than an eye brow gel (more for night time than day), but it fills in very nicely and naturally.</li>
      <li>I actually like it better than the Benefit Brow powder.</li>
      <li>Just like the dark powder, the medium has amazing staying power and the price is RIGHT.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased the dark powder which I LOVE for</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I was searching for, thanks.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product and it came in earlier than expected:)</li>
      <li>It came in a black box nicely packaged with tissue paper and a card from sigma .</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Very misleading unusable for me</li>
      <li>the product should adhere to the brow better to avoid a messy application.</li>
      <li>the product is ok, not nearly as pigmented as the wet n wild brow powder i use, but it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>And I love Anastasia&#x27;s dipbrow, but there comes a time when you have to get past the hype and realize that Anastasia is more expensive not because of quality, but because she knows people will pay.  </li>
      <li>Sigma is very underrated in the brow powder department, and it&#x27;s about time credit is given where it is due.  </li>

<li> I couldn&#x27;t find too many reviews about this powder which is why I had to write this, especially for dark haired women and men who have a difficult time deciding which to purchase.</li>
<li> I have dark brown/black hair, and my eyebrows are the same.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s staying power and price compared to Anastasia, but the dark was TOO dark, and the lighter color had too much red in the brown...</li>
<li> So I have dark brown or black hair, I go back and forth in color.  </li>
<li> With the dark, the lighter brown was still VERY DARK, with VERY RED tones in it</li>
<li> A little goes a long way: start out with the lighter of the two colors even if you like your brows dark.</li>
<li> Way too dark for a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; shade.</li>

    <li> Love it! Looks more natural!</li>
    <li> These colors are just right for my hair snd skin tone. The powder has a nice feel andgoes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Perfect shade for a blonde.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect. Easy to apply and stays put! I also love that it&#x27;s a creamy powder.</li>
    <li> BEST BROW POWDER EVER</li>
    <li> Best brow product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!</li>
    <li> using a brow brush, the eyebrow powder tends to splay in all directions when applying, to the eyes, eyelids, and cheeks.  the product should adhere to the brow better to avoid a messy application.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Received on time.</li>
    <li> Loved it! it&#x27;s exactly what I was searching for, thanks.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s more like eye shadow, it smears.</li>
    <li> So I have dark brown or black hair, I go back and forth in color.  I originally purchased the dark powder which I LOVE for it&#x27;s staying power and price compared to Anastasia, but the dark was TOO dark, and the lighter color had too much red in the brown...but the MEDIUM is PERFECT!!  If anyone is debating which to get, I would recommend the Medium 150%. The dark color is a perfect neutral brown, and the more you apply the darker you can make it.  The lighter side is PERFECT for the front of the brown!! With the dark, the lighter brown was still VERY DARK, with VERY RED tones in it and I just never used it- forget about putting it at the front of the brow.  Just like the dark powder, the medium has amazing staying power and the price is RIGHT.  As always, Sigma does an amazing job with shipping and packaging.  I couldn&#x27;t find too many reviews about this powder which is why I had to write this, especially for dark haired women and men who have a difficult time deciding which to purchase. In my honest opinion, Sigma&#x27;s powder brow products are far better than Anastasia&#x27;s in price, quality and staying power.  And I love Anastasia&#x27;s dipbrow, but there comes a time when you have to get past the hype and realize that Anastasia is more expensive not because of quality, but because she knows people will pay.  Sigma is very underrated in the brow powder department, and it&#x27;s about time credit is given where it is due.  The price is amazing because Sigma appreciates it&#x27;s customers and there things do not cost a fortune to make.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I use the powder less frequently than an eye brow gel (more for night time than day), but it fills in very nicely and naturally. A little goes a long way: start out with the lighter of the two colors even if you like your brows dark.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews from TiffanyD about this Sigma Brow Powder Duo - Medium, I decided to purchase it but I don&#x27;t like how looks on me, so I won&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
    <li> Really nice product and the color was the perfect shade for my brows. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I received my package but there was no any item into the package</li>
    <li> Perfect color for burnettes.</li>
    <li> Way too dark for a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; shade. I would say more like black/brown. Very misleading unusable for me</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend well ..application looks spotty</li>
    <li> Omg i love it . Its just like the anastasia beverly hills duo brow powder but i think this ones better . It came in a black box nicely packaged with tissue paper and a card from sigma . Its so cute im keeping the box lol . Would defenitly reccomend this product . Will be ordering from them again !!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brow powder. I actually like it better than the Benefit Brow powder. This stuff definitely keeps my eyebrows on a lot longer than my brow pomade alone. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Love this duo.  Get yourself a good eyebrow brush and you will be very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> cute packaging. the product is ok, not nearly as pigmented as the wet n wild brow powder i use, but it gets the job done. would not buy again just based on the price and because there are cheaper, good quality alternatives out there.</li>
    <li> I love it, its exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Love the powder but these brows are jacked up so it doesn&#x27;t look right yet. Lol</li>
    <li> I have used for some time &amp; is inexpensive &amp; works for my coloring &amp; is Lon lasting.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown/black hair, and my eyebrows are the same.  The lighter shade is perfect to fill in sparse areas, and the darker color is perfect to fill in some patches (I have a scar on my eyebrow and do not grow any hair there).  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product and it came in earlier than expected:) It&#x27;s the one of the best I have tried so far.</li>
