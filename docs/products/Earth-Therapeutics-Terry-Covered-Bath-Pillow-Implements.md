      <li>This is a great bath pillow, it&#x27;s soft and comfy and looks good in our tub, but one of the suction cups is permanently folded on the side, so I can&#x27;t get it to stay in place like it should.</li>
      <li>This stays blown up and very comfortable while bathing or soaking.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable in the bath.</li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t used many bath pillows, but I have no complaints about this one.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s OK because I just lean it against the tiles.</li>
      <li>pleased</li>
      <li>I have never been able to fall asleep in a bath until now.</li>
      <li>Love this pillow.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be more substantial.</li>
      <li>Very nice large pillow</li>
      <li>works perfect for those long soaking bath times.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I am 9 months pregnant and have been taking warm baths at night to help soothe aches and pains, and to help me sleep.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, it makes the tub much more comfortable.</li>
      <li>The pillow is easy to inflate (by mouth) and stays inflated.</li>
      <li>Holds air just fine.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfy and air dries quickly!</li>

      <li>She is happy with the pillow and has used it several times since purchase.  </li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S SO COMFORTABLE</li>
      <li>This pillow is just right for the job!</li>
      <li>The product feels good up against my back and is bigger than I thought it would be which is good.</li>
      <li>Was larger than I anticipated, which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>It sticks well and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>It dries fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>The color is a nice evergreen, but it is embroidered in white in large letters &amp;#34;Earth Therapeutics&amp;#34; across the top.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best bath pillows I&#x27;ve bought, the color is a nice dark green.</li>
      <li>Highly reccomend!!!</li>
      <li>Lovely bath pillow, with 4 suction pads behind, the terry material is part of the pillow, not a cover, which is great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t deflate mine, just stick it near the top of the tub surround when not used for bathing.</li>
      <li>Good suction cups keep it in place in the tub without slipping when using it.</li>
      <li>As for comfort it is a nice shell shape and as long as you dont over fill it with air</li>
      <li>Soft and comfortable with the terry cloth lining.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I recommend you lightly bite down on the inflation tube while blowing it up, as with many inflatable items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sure thing, if you YANK on it rudely, it&#x27;ll probably tear and then you&#x27;ll bitch about the product when the product should bitch about you. :)</li>
      <li>It is sewn in a very contrasting white colour on the terry cloth across the front of the pillow near the top.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold air very well and it isn&#x27;t the pillow that I have been looking for.</li>
      <li>very comfy.</li>
      <li>I have bought other bath pillows off amazon that were better, stay away from this one.</li>
      <li>Decent quality bath pillow.</li>
      <li>Used a similar product at my sister&#x27;s house last year, couldn&#x27;t find one like it in my neighborhood stores, found THIS one and just love it.</li>
      <li>One thing stood out: some people seem to think that just because a bath pillow has suction cups, you should just be able to yank it off, have the little cups go pop, and there ya go.</li>
      <li>Leave a little play in it, and it will be much better than it is</li>
      <li>Worth double the price to get two.</li>
      <li>Pillow was larger then expected and terry cloth is nice and soft.</li>
      <li>My tub is cold and it&#x27;s a perfect I inexpensive cushion for my back.  </li>
      <li>The suction doesn&#x27;t work very well, but for a short (10-minute) bath session it doesn&#x27;t matter much.</li>
      <li>This is really comfy and better than other bath pillows I have had, but it takes quite awhile to dry out.  </li>
      <li>Old fashioned, just like they used to make them.</li>
      <li>It is holding up well thus far.  </li>
      <li>The terrycloth tends to collect mildew, and the suction cups don&#x27;t stick if you blow it up completely.  </li>
      <li>The fabric on the front is soft, not itchy.</li>
      <li>I have even used it, it is a lot better than the larger more clumsy bath pillows we have had in the past.</li>
      <li>I just purchased another one to have on hand, but I think this one will hold up better than other pillows I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
      <li>Cloth is a little rougher than I expected, but still comfortable to rest my head on during a soak.</li>
      <li>Was a little skeptical at low price compared to quality, but turns out this was a great purchase.</li>
      <li>Pretty green color.</li>

    <li> Lovely bath pillow, with 4 suction pads behind, the terry material is part of the pillow, not a cover, which is great. It is a nice size, supports your shoulders as well as your neck. There is a noticeable medium sized logo which is not shown in the photo. It says Earth Therapeutics. It is sewn in a very contrasting white colour on the terry cloth across the front of the pillow near the top.</li>
    <li> This is really comfy and better than other bath pillows I have had, but it takes quite awhile to dry out.  Sill a good product.</li>
    <li> I purcased the dark green color because it was cheaper but if I had to reorder I would get the white so I could bleach it. I also found that two of the four suction cups do not work. I believe it was because when they were packaged and folded, it bent back two of them. Which now they are not suctioning like they should. As for comfort it is a nice shell shape and as long as you dont over fill it with air then it might last a while.</li>
    <li> This bath \\&quot;pillow\\&quot; is SO small it dont even cradle My back and I am a small person, its pathetically small, completely not worth the money at all.  I have bought other bath pillows off amazon that were better, stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I am 9 months pregnant and have been taking warm baths at night to help soothe aches and pains, and to help me sleep. The pillow is larger than I anticipated, which is wonderful. I have had it for almost four weeks and have noticed no air leaks. It dries fairly quickly. The fabric on the front is soft, not itchy. The suction cups work well enough. If I begine sliding in the bathtub the pillow slides down as well, but that is to be expected; however, the pillow does stay stuck to the tub.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this pillow. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The terry surface is nice and the suction worked well. Like the plastic case for storage. I haven&#x27;t used many bath pillows, but I have no complaints about this one.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best bath pillows I&#x27;ve bought, the color is a nice dark green. So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it deflating or bad smell. I just purchased another one to have on hand, but I think this one will hold up better than other pillows I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I recommend this pillow.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Pretty green color. The product feels good up against my back and is bigger than I thought it would be which is good. It&#x27;s not real big but it&#x27;s a little bigger than I thought. The sucker things don&#x27;t work because of the type of tiles on my bathroom wall but that&#x27;s OK because I just lean it against the tiles. I would definitely do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> works perfect for those long soaking bath times. This stays blown up and very comfortable while bathing or soaking. Like it  lot</li>
    <li> Plastic is no bueno for earth</li>
    <li> This is a great bath pillow, it&#x27;s soft and comfy and looks good in our tub, but one of the suction cups is permanently folded on the side, so I can&#x27;t get it to stay in place like it should.</li>
    <li> The terrycloth tends to collect mildew, and the suction cups don&#x27;t stick if you blow it up completely.  Leave a little play in it, and it will be much better than it is when fully inflated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a little hard to inflate.  I recommend you lightly bite down on the inflation tube while blowing it up, as with many inflatable items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it makes the tub much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Love it! Soft and comfortable with the terry cloth lining.</li>
    <li> Very nice large pillow</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my pre-teen daughter who likes to soak in the tub.  She is happy with the pillow and has used it several times since purchase.  It is holding up well thus far.  It does get dried out between baths.</li>
    <li> Decent quality bath pillow. Cloth is a little rougher than I expected, but still comfortable to rest my head on during a soak.</li>
    <li> This is a great size and the quality s good for the price. It sticks well and shipped quickly. I would order another one.</li>
    <li> This pillow is a lot bigger than tub pillows I&#x27;ve used in the past and for some that may be a plus but I found it a little cumbersome since I really only wanted it for my neck mainly. It&#x27;s comfy enough but I took away 2 stars for the size because I think it should state its an oversized pillow somewhere in the description. I&#x27;ve only used this twice and its comfy enough I guess. Stuck well to the tub.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS TO SIT ON AS BATH HURTS MY BONES, I HAVE RA.  TOTALLY PERFECT, JUST DON&#x27;T INFLATE FULLY OR YOU&#x27;RE IN FOR A HASSLE.  IT&#x27;S SO COMFORTABLE I JUST ORDERED ANOTHER TO USE AS PILLOW!</li>
    <li> Used a similar product at my sister&#x27;s house last year, couldn&#x27;t find one like it in my neighborhood stores, found THIS one and just love it. What could be simpler than blowing up a pillow and sticking it on the back of the bathtub so you can enjoy a relaxing bath? Nothing! It&#x27;s perfect. When deciding upon this purchase, I read many reviews of like-products. One thing stood out: some people seem to think that just because a bath pillow has suction cups, you should just be able to yank it off, have the little cups go pop, and there ya go. Well, no, it doesn&#x27;t work that way. This is a terry-covered VINYL blowup pillow so don&#x27;t yank it, slide it...or push your finger against the suction cups to release the suction. Sure thing, if you YANK on it rudely, it&#x27;ll probably tear and then you&#x27;ll bitch about the product when the product should bitch about you. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s comfy and air dries quickly!</li>
    <li> Comes nicely package, blows up to correct size and feels very comfortable. Was a little skeptical at low price compared to quality, but turns out this was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> This pillow is just right for the job!</li>
    <li> We were looking for an affordable bath pillow and this one met our expectations. The pillow is easy to inflate (by mouth) and stays inflated. The suction doesn&#x27;t work very well, but for a short (10-minute) bath session it doesn&#x27;t matter much. Just prop it up against the end of the tub and lean back. We wedge it in an empty towel rack to dry.</li>
    <li> Pillow was larger then expected and terry cloth is nice and soft. Good suction cups keep it in place in the tub without slipping when using it.</li>
    <li> Great bath pillow!  Old fashioned, just like they used to make them. Good sized, inflatable and comfortable.  Covered in terry cloth. Dark green in color.  Suction cups hold it well attached.  Holds air just fine.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be more substantial. Not what I expected. It doesn&#x27;t hold air very well and it isn&#x27;t the pillow that I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> Just perfect!  Just what I wanted and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  Green was hard to find but you came through ! Thanks</li>
    <li> I went ahead and bought two. I have them side by side. Makes me feel like its a thrown. I&#x27;ve had the pink and baby blue in the past, but this hunter green is rich. I love them!!! I had looked at all the drug stores where years ago you could find them. Worth double the price to get two. No complaints from me!</li>
    <li> It was a great product! I got it for my wife and she uses it every time she takes a bath. I have even used it, it is a lot better than the larger more clumsy bath pillows we have had in the past.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to fall asleep in a bath until now. This pillow is the best thing I have purchased this year for a great price. Highly reccomend!!!</li>
    <li> This bath pillow is the perfect size and shape for a relaxing soak.  The color is a nice evergreen, but it is embroidered in white in large letters &amp;#34;Earth Therapeutics&amp;#34; across the top.</li>
    <li> The pillow is comfortable and has stayed inflated. The suction cups do not work at all so there is a lot of re-positioning of the pillow.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. My tub is cold and it&#x27;s a perfect I inexpensive cushion for my back.  Delivered on time and product as expected.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! Was larger than I anticipated, which is a good thing. Very comfortable in the bath. I&#x27;ll probably order one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day!</li>
    <li> was a little bigger than anticipated. very comfy. pleased</li>
    <li> Product performs just as expected.  I blew it up, stuck it to the tub, and found my bath experience to be infinitely better.  I don&#x27;t deflate mine, just stick it near the top of the tub surround when not used for bathing. Logo is not that obtrusive.</li>
