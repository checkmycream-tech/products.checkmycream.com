<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought a big bottle of this shampoo because I had read good reviews about it.  I was looking for something that is the best shampoo for fine, dry hair.  I read that it has the same ingredients as Keratase, which is a $30 shampoo. I have used it maybe 5 days, and it makes my hair feel smooth and silky!  I LOVE the smell.  When I told my daughter about it, she told me that she tried it and it made her hair greasy feeling.  We have the same fine hair, but I think I use more products that dry my hair out than she does.  I just went to the salon yesterday to have a glossing done, to tame and hide my wild graying hair.  My beautician told me to use shampoo that is specifically for color treated hair so today I purchased Garnier Color Shield.  I hope it works as well as the daily care does!  If not, I suppose I will have to hunt down the daily care product for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, can&#x27;t beat it for the price! I&#x27;m not too picky so it fits my needs and arrived as described.</li>
    <li> It is a great shampoo.  I feel my hair getting stronger. When it shipped to me it opened in the box and got all over everything else but it smells great.</li>
    <li> I have bought this twice now and while I like the shampoo, both times the bottle leaked in the box and got all over everything. This is an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; item for subscribe and save so by default it is going to be included with other items. Now I have cat food and paper towels that are slimy with shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does what it is supposed to do.  It leaves the hair clean and shinny and smelling good.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> have been washing my hair with this for nearly six years. Its cheap, affordable, and get the job done. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically just a regular shampoo. nothing fancy, but it does the job (and for a pretty good price too)</li>
    <li> i order this thru amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save. i get it at a reduced price and the price beat all other stores. i order several and stock up on them at such a good price for lean times. it smells so yummy and leaves my hair very clean. takes out all the products i use in my hair like gel, mousse, hairspray with just one wash.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does a nice job as promised.  Hair feel fine and looks good after its use.  Healthy and effective ingredients.</li>
    <li> Your typical shampoo, good for my husband since he washes his hair everyday.  It was a good price and we have used this shampoo before.</li>
    <li> I like the Garnier line, but the lid can be hard to open... they must have figured that out because this had a new lid design that is WAY better than the old one.</li>
    <li> This might not be a super fancy shampoo from the &#x27;salon&#x27; that your wife would use, but it is still an excellent quality nice smelling shampoo that gets the job done, and more.  Recently my kids discovered my shampoo, and now I am buying several bottles at a time so they can have their own in their bathrooms.  Great quality, great job, great value.</li>
    <li> not fine or dry but middling and normal, you&#x27;ll probably do okay with this.  For me, it was too drying, and I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  I guess it&#x27;s fruit I smell, but it&#x27;s an odd fruit, if it is - and I don&#x27;t like my hair to smell like fruit anyhow.  Not for me, maybe for you if you&#x27;re normal and want an okay nothing special shampoo - that smells like artificial fruit.</li>
    <li> well my sister uses this product and she seems to like it since she keeps buying them.&lt;br /&gt;the Small of it is great. fast shipping</li>

    <li> Stuff&#x27;s okay, I feel like the shampoo really strips my hair to a point that the conditioner can&#x27;t quite make up for ... smells nice though.</li>

    <li> Its cheap&lt;br /&gt;It does the job&lt;br /&gt;It has this fruity strawberry berry fruit mmm smell that you never get bored applying it&lt;br /&gt;Its cheap&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a primer to prep my hair before I apply the anti dandruff shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Fits my need</li>
