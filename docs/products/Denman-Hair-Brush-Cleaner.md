<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have never used one of these, but this works as well as anything I can imagine.</li>
    <li> this is the most handy tool for cleaning my brushes and combs. It cleans my long hair out of my brush in a flash and the bristles are stiff so they clean your brush really well in between washing with brush cleaner. I like to use clean brushes and combs, well like MOST people do, but I have arthritis and sometimes it hurts to pick the hair out between the bristles. This is just quick and easy.  It works well to wash your brush too, because it really gets in there and scrubs.</li>
    <li> This works great and is not expensive.</li>
    <li> it works but it takes a LOT of effort to use. i had to scrape one hairbrush for over 5 min with this to clean it. also it removes the plastic bristle heads many times.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner.  Very strong</li>
    <li> This is the best hair brush cleaner that I&#x27;ve ever used and I have used a few. It removes hairs so easily from the brushes and it is excellent for cleaning your combs as well. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Works so good. I use this everyday.</li>
    <li> Great tool to quickly and easily remove hair from any brush.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and did a excellent  job of cleaning my natural bristle brush.</li>
    <li> I LOVVVEEEEE this !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have super long hair down to my waist, and my brushes accumulate so much hair from brushing and styling. This makes my hair brushes look brand new! I ordered 3 different brush cleaners just to compare, and this one BY FAR is the best one!!! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!</li>
    <li> This brush cleaner does a nice job cleaning the lint and hair from my boar bristle brushes.  I like that I can remove lint and hair easily and quickly before brushing my hair.  Good product with a good price.</li>
    <li> We must take care of our brushes, ladies!!! I used to let my products build up in my brushes, and it would just get transferred back into my hair! YUCK!! Weekly, I wash my brushes with a touch of clarifying shampoo and this brush cleaner--squeaky clean results every time!</li>
    <li> It is OK, will use it as a supplement to Phillip B hairbrush cleaner.</li>
    <li> Does a great job at clean my Denman brushes plus my regular brushes</li>
    <li> Okay, this does the trick!  I do use it for hairbrush cleaning, but I also use it to clean a &amp;#34;filter&amp;#34; that pulls out in my washing machine.  Cat hair tends to pile up on it, and it&#x27;s not easy to clean off....but this stiff brush works great!</li>
    <li> Very dangerous, pointy device.  The handle is way too short to hold, so one end or the other WILL poke you.  Realizing this while holding it, I still managed to poke myself while simply throwing it away!</li>
    <li> Keeps brushes like new. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This brush cleaning tool works perfectly.  I love the design and how it pulls the hair left behind in my brush.  It is sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> Seems kind of pricey for a piece of plastic, but it&#x27;s a great tool. It&#x27;s well made, too, for what it is- I doubt any of the bristles will ever fall out. It certainly gets the job done, both removing the hair from the hairbrush and getting down to where the bristles are attached to clean the cylinder or spine of the brush itself. The bristles are quite stiff, and they collect all that little fuzz very well. It would probably work well to clean in other hard-to-reach places, like between keys on a keyboard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying, and trying, so many hair brush cleaners.  None of them really did the job well.&lt;br /&gt;The Denman Hair Brush Cleaner is wonderful and actually cleans all my brushes.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS!!! At first, I was afraid the bristles would scrape my denham paddle brush but IT DIDN&#x27;T! Super glad I bought this brush cleaner!</li>
    <li> Works very well for cleaning my boar bristle hair brush!</li>
    <li> I love this cleaner! It removes hair and debris from the brush almost effortlessly. Super handy, easy, fast. I also use it to clean hair dryer attachments.</li>
    <li> Brought this to clean my new Denman hair brush. Its practical and effective hairbrush cleaning tool. Easy andd effective way to remove hair and dust/fluff.</li>
    <li> I use the brush to detangle after I&#x27;ve put on conditioner so the hair is coated in products and makes ti difficult to clean the bruch without a specific tool. This thing makes it easy. It even has a sort of pick at the end which helps get all the gunk out of my brush.</li>
    <li> Works really well overall and find it less challenging to clean my brush using it.  Always good to have a tool to clean up hair brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service AAA+++</li>
    <li> It works pretty much as described. . but does not get it all totally clean. . .I wonder if anything works.</li>
    <li> Great cleaning brush, well-made, sturdy. Delivered earlier than estimated. I have almost waist length hair, and use a boar bristle brush. It was always tedious and time consuming to clean my brush of fuzz-its. This brush cleaning tool worked great. I washed my brush with warm water and a little baby shampoo, used the pick at top for all the long hairs, rinsed and shook out brush, then used the mid-sized bristles on tool, rinsed and shook out brush, then used the the long bristles on tool to search for any fuzz-its. My brush is so clean, and it took very little time to complete. Didn&#x27;t damage or pull out any of the boar bristles on my brush, which using a comb often happened. I&#x27;m going to order some for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> The hairs end up getting caught in this which sort of defeats the purpose but it does help.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush cleaner to remove the hair from my Denman paddle brush. It works great! The long bristles on this brush cleaner are quite stiff, making it easy to run through each row of the paddle brush bristles and grab the hair. It also helps remove the fluff that builds up at the base of the brush bristles. I also found that that the brush cleaner is quite effective for removing the lint buildup on the outside of my hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush cleaner. I&#x27;m just happy that this even exist and no more picking hairs outta of the brush with your fingers.</li>
    <li> very practical, does the job</li>
    <li> The brush is rough and  it was hard to clean  because it is very stiff.</li>
    <li> Great product,  thank you</li>
    <li> For the first time, I&#x27;m finally getting my Denman hair brush clean. This works perfectly. (I also used it to clean my vacuum cleaner brush clean. It worked fine for that too.)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would end up being a flimsy little brush; however, it&#x27;s a sturdy product made in the U.K. and cleaned my brush well.  After cleaning my hairbrush, I cleaned this brush cleaner with some soapy water and let it dry.  Will get another one for my mother.</li>
    <li> It kind of works for what its supposed to do. I was hoping it would be more effective of removing the lint I always seem to get on my bamboo bristle brush but I haven&#x27;t found anything better yet. Its still a pain but its easier than trying to pull it all off with my fingers.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush cleaner was just what I was looking for.  It was delivered just a couple days after I ordered it.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Not the best.  Wouldn&#x27;t order again!</li>
    <li> I have used this daily for the past year and it is in the same condition as when I bought it.  The plastic is not brittle, and it bends just slightly when needed.  I had tried another brush cleaner and its plastic was brittle hard and I was afraid to try put and pressure at all on it.  I thought it would snap on me.  I think rhis will the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I ordered this sort of blindly after looking at these products online.  I think it is a great product and works very well.  It is priced just right.  I does get all of the white fuzzies out of a brush like one of the previous reviews said.  Love it! Still love this brush. Very effective.  Considering purchasing this for gifts. Nothing is better than giving something you love and very practical. I know that everyone I would give this to would love it!</li>
    <li> Not sure what I expected, but this is an interesting little contraption. That doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m disappointed; this just isn&#x27;t what I was expecting. Nevertheless, this is a good sturdy brush cleaner and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> gets all the hair out of my brushes! Very useful and easy to use. Now how to get the hair off this itself? LOL</li>
    <li> Nice. I&#x27;m using it for a teasing comb. Need to order another.</li>
    <li> this makes cleaning your brushes so much easier</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this item. I didn&#x27;t see how it could be any easier to clean a brush with this Denman Brush Cleaner vs. any other. I was pleasantly surprised. I use the pointed end to pull up any hair I couldn&#x27;t get out with my hands and then I run the larger bristle end across the brush (use a little &amp;#34;elbow grease&amp;#34;!). The smaller bristled end works great for the edges or corners I couldn&#x27;t get to with the larger end. I rinse or soak both the brush and the Brush Cleaner in a little soapy water (shampoo works great too), rinse and dry. My brushes look good as new. This works on all my brushes, not just the Denman brush I have!</li>
    <li> Sturdy, well made tool that is very useful for cleaning multiple hairbrushes in our household.  Gets in between bristles to clean each one as well as the base.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning brushes and combs - good stiff bristles that do the job quickly and it cleans up like a dream!</li>
    <li> Great little item works so well</li>
    <li> Short of losing it or somehow melting it. Super sturdy &amp; easy to use.</li>
    <li> Denman deserves its respected reputation for fine hair brushes at modest prices.  Denman&#x27;s hair brush cleaner bests all the others.  It is easy to use, completely effective and one third the price, if not less, of the next best hair brush cleaners.  Indeed, there are brush cleaners more expensive than many of Denman&#x27;s brushes.  A good brush will not remain that way without appropriate care, which entails cleaning the brush periodically.  This is the brush cleaner to use for that simple yet essential task.</li>
    <li> This brush works perfectly for cleaning out my BBB!</li>
    <li> this is the best brush cleaner i have ever used. takes no time to get a super hairy brush clean. received it way before amazon said i would too!</li>
    <li> I have very long fine hair and I hate cleaning my hair brushes. The hair is easy enough to remove but those fuzzies that get caught around the bristles drive me nuts! This is amazing at getting rid of those as well as hair and dead skin cells. I always use this before I wash my brushes, they look like brand new when I&#x27;m done. This product has been worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it cleans hair brushes and looks brand new when you do. I hate dust balls that get stuck in between the bristles. Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream - especially on round brushes.</li>
    <li> Does the job it was made to do; I bought extra to give my husband and daughter.</li>
    <li> This brush cleaner works great! It get all of the hair and gunk out of my hair brushes really easily.</li>
    <li> I got this to clean all of my various combs and brushes.  It is nice because it has 3 types of ways to remove hair, and scrape off dust and residues.  The brush ends are soft enough that they don&#x27;t pull the &#x27;ball&#x27; ends off some of my brushes, and rigid enough to scrub.</li>
    <li> I love the little pick on the end. It really helps getting those hairs that stick to the bottom of your brush that can be a pain to get. This is the best brush cleaner I&#x27;ve had. It&#x27;s really good!</li>
    <li> This brush cleaner is a must. It really comes in handy and easily removes hair from the bristles of my Denman brush.</li>
    <li> I have been using a brush cleaner with flexible metal rake like teeth, fine for those drugstore brushes.I didn&#x27;t want to damage my nylon bristles embedded in foam on my great Denman brushes. So happy I got this, also works on an inexpensive nylon/boar bristle brush I have.&lt;br /&gt;When your hair is clean and fresh, you want your brushes the same!</li>
    <li> Got this to clean my cat brush. Works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Cleaned a round brush that I was considering throwing away because I could not get it clean.  Happy with this item.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning my hair brushes!!</li>
    <li> Hair brush cleaner helps to get all the loose hair and dust from the paddle brush. It is nice to be able to get to the base and be able to use a clean brush.</li>
    <li> It will lengthen the life of all my brushes, being able to clean them professionally will give them more life!  Good packaging and great delivery.</li>
    <li> A nice sturdy item that does the job it is meant to do! It removes hair &amp; lint &amp;#34;fuzzier&amp;#34; from all my brushes! Use it with shampoo to remove built up oil &amp; hair styling products.</li>
    <li> It was bigger than I was expecting.  It sure does clean my brush.  Yep, really really clean.  Like new even.  (Have I gotten 20 words?)</li>
    <li> This helps with further cleaning your hair brushes after finally getting it loosen, pulled out by the Olivia hair brush cleaner and it costs so little so I believe you should order them as a set and you will see what I did.  I did that because of other reviews that I read here on Amazon ,</li>
    <li> works good with my Kent brush for cleaning it.</li>
    <li> I own two of these.  They work great to safely clean the hair out of my hair brushes.  They don&#x27;t hurt the hair brushes in the process.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Who knew you needed a brush for your brush! This works very well. I&#x27;m getting a second one for my long haired dogs brushes.</li>
    <li> This little item works great cleaning out brushes.&lt;br /&gt;It is plain and simple. So easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to clean all my hairbrushes and this product was recommended to me. Got to say it is perfect for not only my hair brushes, but also my combs.</li>
    <li> Not only cleans hairbrushes but I also bought one to clean the brush attachments on vacuums! Amazon should feature this item.</li>
    <li> A great little tool that I never even knew existed until I stumbled upon it while looking for replacement hair brushes.  It is sturdy, works much better than the comb I used in the past, and it is amazingly affordable.  Especially when considering that it is being shipped from the UK to the US!  If you are thinking about getting one, I encourage you to go ahead and pull the trigger.</li>
    <li> really good for cleaning hairbrushes</li>
    <li> Such a great little brush to clean brushes! I suffer from Alopecia and so does my mom so the hair loss on our round brushes is tremendous. This little cleaner is amazing! Gets the hair out in a jiffy and the price was great!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome.  It cleans my brush like new!  I have even used it as a hairbrush in a pinch, though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that as the bristles are quite stiff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this tool. I used to clean my hair brushes with an old toothbrush, but this works much better. The pointed end is excellent for removing hair from the brush. It works for my long hair and also for my husband&#x27;s short hair on his brush. It is not something that anyone needs, but it certainly is useful.</li>
    <li> but the Kent brand brush cleaner does it better, while being easier to clean. On the other hand, Kent broke after about a year of infrequent use for no good reason.</li>
    <li> Cleans my brushes perfectly! Who knew how easy it could be to clean your brush with a tool like this!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this little tool.  It was well priced and arrived on time.  I was amazed at how well it cleaned up my hair brushes.  It effectively removed all the loose hair and assorted gunk that had built up on my brushes with very little effort on my part.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make cleaning their hairbrushes a snap.  Would definitely purchase another one if needed.</li>
    <li> The cleaner does a very good job, glad that I purchased it. If necessary will buy another one as replacement</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know something like this even existed until I came online to buy a new Denman hairbrush because my old one (probably ten years old) was so gunky despite my trying everything to clean it. I pulled hairs out by hand constantly, used my fingers to get shampoo as far down the bristles as I could, soaked it in vinegar to get rid of oils, and left it overnight in sudsy water. None of that left me with anything close to a clean hairbrush and saturated under the pad with water which worries me for mold growth. Ten minutes with this cleaning brush though, and both my Denman and my husband&#x27;s natural bristle brush look completely new and are totally clean of oils, fuzzies, and almost free of trapped hairs. So I only saved about $10 over buying a new brush, but having this will save me from sending a perfectly good brush into the landfills to sit there forever every ten years or so. I see myself having my Denman for another happy ten+ years with quick bi-weekly scrubs with this brush and a clarifying shampoo.</li>
    <li> It works great.  Better than the one that I paid twice as much for at Beauty Brands and it came super fast, even from overseas.</li>
    <li> I use this on the Denman detangling brush as well as my other brushes. It does a great job and I love it.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is a great hairbrush cleaner. I use it almost daily. It arrived timely and was well packaged. The price is a steal. Also, I must say The Denman Company is top notch. I had to call them and they were prompt, professional and a pleasure to work with!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this hairbrush cleaner!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years now to clean my Denman styling brush. I have recently started using a Kent hair brush also and in my opinion this Denman brush cleaner works better than the Kent brush cleaner on Kent&#x27;s brushes. So I ordered a second one for my travel kit. I have nothing but praise for Kent and Denman brushes, but this Denman cleaner is just perfect for what it does.</li>
    <li> You wouldn&#x27;t believe how many people don&#x27;t clean their hairbrushes, it&#x27;s horrific. If you actually took time to look at the base of your hairbrush and see all the gunk and oil that gets piled up there and that fact you run that through your hair everyday and are just transferring that stuff back to your hair. You would notice a vast improvement in your hair, especially when you brush it if you took time to clean the brush. Having said that this cheap little tool makes it a heck of a lot easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning your brush is much more than just pulling out the hair (though you must do that too). I clean my brushes thoroughly about every few weeks and here&#x27;s how I recommend you do that using this little tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove all the hair from your brush using a comb and the pointy tip of this little tool (which makes it much easier to get all the little hairs out).&lt;br /&gt;Using a tub or bowl large enough to fully encompass the brush(es) and fill it with hot water (about an 1-1.5\\&quot;, just enough to submerge the bristles/spikes) and mix in liquid antibacterial soap (or a gel shampoo) and a sprinkle of baking soda (optional: a splash of vinegar I recommend). Mix it together to create suds. (On a side note I have found this mixture which is made by stuff around your house works better than any specifically intended liquid/powder hairbrush cleaner I&#x27;ve purchased)&lt;br /&gt;Allow the brush(es) to soak for about two hours. Make sure the brushes are facing down and the bristles are completely submerged.&lt;br /&gt;remove them and rinse them thoroughly under warm water and use this cleaning tool to scrub them and remove anything from them.&lt;br /&gt;Shake them brush out and drain the water than will be trapped in it.&lt;br /&gt;Allow the brushes to dry upside down overnight on a towel.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to scrub this little cleaner out afterwards with some soap and water to remove anything from it.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleaning tool is sturdy with very stiff bristles that are very long and can reach and really scrub the base of the brush. They are very stiff and strong and will last a long time. Invest in this little tool, will make your life much easier! Before this tool I was trying to use a nailbrush which bristles were not nearly long enough to reach the base and weren&#x27;t nearly stiff enough. Then I came to amazon and found this (which I didn&#x27;t even know existed),amazon you have everything. This is a must have, clean your brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because it may be worth mentioning do NOT use this method to clean Mason pearson brushes. They cannot be submerged in water and come with their own cleaning tool and cleaning instructions.d can reach and really scrub the base of the brush.

    <li> I would return it if the postage didn&#x27;t cost more than the brush.</li>
    <li> This hair brush cleaner really does take all the hair out and is so easy to use. It is lightweight and easily stored away.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this but it actually really works with much ease and now I can clean all my hairbrushes!</li>
    <li> This little brush does the trick!  It&#x27;s simple, well made and does just what it&#x27;s made to do.  It cleans all of my boar bristle brushes completely and yet gently.</li>
    <li> I use it to clean my hair brush, and to tease my hair. It does a good job on both!</li>
    <li> This thing is perfect for picking up hair off of the carpet!! Our vacuum has no problems with clogging now.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific brush cleaner. The two kinds of firm wire heads clean both boar bristle and nylon bristle brushes completely - even ones with ball-tips. The pointed tip can be used to pick through any tangles or loose hairs that might have been missed by either of the other heads. This is so much better than the rake-type cleaner. The Denman brush cleaner pretty much makes it effortless to keep your brushes clean and, most of the time, one pass through will be all that&#x27;s needed to gather up any hair left in the brush. It&#x27;s one of those tools that just seems to work just as it should. Whether it&#x27;s correct engineering or components, this is a tool that simply works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I started to give this 4 stars but that wouldn&#x27;t be fair considering I had no idea *until I tried yesterday* this worked on ALL of my brushes. I thought it was only a certain brush type but it works on all I have. Also this is a sturdy brush cleaner because I worked this brush tool over I promise lol and it nothing broke off, nothing was bent, this is a good brush plus it arrived early!</li>
    <li> At first I thought-- what a waste of money! A brush for a brush? RIPOFF! Then I tried to clean my first Denman the old fashioned way by taking it apart, soaking it &amp; running a comb through it. Needless to say, my prized Denman didn&#x27;t last too long after a few of those &#x27;cleanings.&#x27; I put up the money to see if this thing was really worth it. IT IS REALLY WORTH IT! You can clean your Denman wet or dry, with soap or without, virtually anywhere. It gets all the hair &amp; &#x27;extras&#x27; out. ALL OF IT. Without any elbow grease or curses to the underworld. Fantastic tool. Get it. NOW.</li>
    <li> Love this! Does a great job of cleaning the nasty fuzzies that accumulate at the base of the hairbrush bristles.  Best cleaner I&#x27;ve used, better than the ones that came with my Kent - or my Denman! - hairbrush. better than the Olivia Garden brush cleaner I bought.  I&#x27;d buy another, and I&#x27;d recommend this to someone looking for a brush cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is a very useful tool to clean brushes.  I just love it !</li>
    <li> This is perfect for cleaning hair brushes. Denman knows hair brushes. The bristles are strong and removes hair very quickly.</li>
    <li> I do not know any body who uses a hair brush cleaner but if you buy a great brush that  you need to care for it properly.</li>
    <li> This does on excellent job on my natural bristle&lt;br /&gt;hair brush.  Gets out all of the hair and skin&lt;br /&gt;fluff.</li>
    <li> I have short wavy hair and usualyl shampoo every day and brush/comb with a paddle brush with nylon bristles.  I don&#x27;t wan&#x27;t to immerse the brush in water, so I thought I would try this while I was ordering a Denman paddle brush. It works well and looks very durable.</li>
    <li> This little thing works a charm for getting out all the hair and those annoying fuzzies from your brush. Does a great job with no problems. I am so very glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me as a Christmas Stocking Stuffer. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! He had heard me get frustrated with cleaning my hairbrushes, so when he saw it as a &amp;#34;possibility&amp;#34; in my Amazon Wish List, and read about it, he decided to go for it!! I am SO glad he did! The pointed end helps pull hair (along with a bit of that &amp;#34;dust ball&amp;#34; effect) up and out of the brush. The bristles on that end are great for brushing perpendicularly  against the bristles of my hairbrush, and the thin section of brushes at the bottom is wonderful for going in between the rows of bristles on my brush. My brushes haven&#x27;t been this clean in YEARS!!!! Great Product!</li>
    <li> It makes cleaning my brushes easy.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the brush cleaner.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected in a product! I have never had a brush that actually cleaned my brushes before, and was delighted to find this product.</li>
    <li> really good product maybe the look is a little bit weird but it&#x27;s very functional,high quality and good price too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair brush cleaning tool for sometime, now.  Received the Denman hair brush cleaner a couple of weeks ago, and it is the best. It&#x27;s easy to use and cleans my brushes as described.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Saves time trying to figure out a strategy to remove all the hairs from the brush during cleaning.  Makes cleaning a breeze.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts when I purchased this but it works great.  I wish I had found it years ago.  It makes cleaning your hairbrush fun.</li>
    <li> Nice tool to use in keeping my hair items (brushes and combs) clean and in good condition.  I&#x27;ve never seen one before and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all this time. The best tool for properly cleaning your whole arsenal oh hair brushes and combs</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for to keep my hairbrush looking clean &amp; new!  Quick &amp; easy to use.  Love.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I bought my denman brush and it works great. It gets up all the hair as well as lint so you can use a clean brush each time. I even use this cleaner on my other brushes.</li>
    <li> I grew up using Denman hairbrushes and somehow never knew of this special brush that helps clean them. It really makes cleaning any hairbrush a pleasure rather than a chore. Denmans are unique in that u can take them apart to clean, but by using this handy tool, you can simply clean them dry without any water or soap or taking them apart. It gets those pesky fuzzy wuzzy lint balls off that have a tendency to collect at the bottom of Denman bristles. The only thing is, there is no brush to clean THIS brush-you will have to wash it with soap and water. I even use this on my conair 100% boar bristle brush I bought@super target for $10(they sell in on here for $11.99). I highly recommend that boar brush for fine tender heads. Denmans are a little firmer on a tender head, but they are great, and I grew up with them-just been a long time since I owned one. Now I have a mini purse size and a full size Denman. Why does a purse size one cost almost the same as a 7row? I mean, seriously, the purse size should be like $5-just sayin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I may have used this brush once or twice. I think my daughter uses it for her dolls</li>
    <li> Makes removing hair from brushes a breeze. Good price.</li>
    <li> This brush cleaner really works. It makes getting hair out of the brush easy. It&#x27;s expensive for what it is, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> For the $5 I spent on this, I guess you could say it was worth the price of admission. When I went to clean out my convention paddle brush that I use on my long hair, it removed it okay. I guess I had high expectations for it to remove a good amount of the hair on my first swipe, but it took many to finally get any out of it. Overall, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this particular model again, but since I have bought it, I guess I will use it. Not worth it for a return.&lt;br /&gt;-Kayla xx</li>
    <li> I had lost my original brush cleaner.  I couldn&#x27;t find another anywhere around.  This really helps keep combs and brushes and stylers clean.</li>
    <li> It is so easy to clean brushes with this. I wish I got it before</li>
    <li> Not only can you get out the hair with the pointed end, you can scrub out the fuzz and residue from hairspray that builds up at the base of the bristles.  The one I had before only cleaned the hair out.</li>
    <li> works great, cleans every brush I own.</li>
    <li> Very handy gadget to have. I&#x27;ve been using a fingernail brush, but it isn&#x27;t deep enough. This gets right down to the base and removes all the hair that gets stuck in the bristles. Not at all flimsy. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> My husband, Dennis, after many years, found that his favorite hair brush was falling apart. I mean over 20 years, so the old one really did stand up well. He told me he had to have another one just like this, same brand, same size.........&lt;br /&gt;Well I would have to look at it closer to see what I could find. I had to laugh, really laugh, my husband is Denman to me more often than not. So, what is the brand on this thing????????? Yep, it was his hairbrush. Amazon, as always, did the trick and we found the exact same brush all of these years later. This time I figured I would get him the cleaning brush as well. What can I say, he doesn&#x27;t clean it but I do and this things works well on his brush and mine as well. Great product.</li>
    <li> This  item does it&#x27;s job like any hairbrush cleaner would do However, there is not much or any hair at all ,because of the Denman Styling Brush and it&#x27;s beautiful result.</li>
    <li> I use it to clean my Denman brush and I like it very much. It is sturdy and does the job well.</li>
    <li> Oh how I love this time-saving gadget. No more spending hours bent over a brush trying to pull the hair and pillow feathers over those little nobs on the end of the bristles, you know, the ones that massage your scalp but can&#x27;t be cleaned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I stumbled onto this handy tool. It works very well and was priced right. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair brushes quickly and easily. I hope I never lose it -- but, if I do, I&#x27;ll def buy another.</li>
    <li> Great price for a brush that perfectly cleans out all your other brushes...works very well, exactly what I needed at this time</li>
    <li> This is an amazing little tool! I used to painstakingly clean around every single bristle in my brushes, trying to get every strand of hair.  This Brush Cleaner makes very quick work of what used to be a never ending chore!  One or two quick strokes almost always completely cleans the brush every time.  I love it!  I wish I&#x27;d discovered it years ago!</li>
    <li> Great for removing hair from brushes and getting between the rows.  I also use it on my electric curling wand.</li>
    <li> Well worth having one more thing cluttering your bathroom drawer.  I bought two and gave one to my daughter.  There is nothing worse than trying to get hair out of a hair brush, this works great!</li>
    <li> It does just the job I needed it to do.  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> It is cheap and works well.  Brushes do need to be cleaned now and then.  This tool does the job.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this, I used to take the brushes apart just to clean them.  It was time consuming and would wear out the brushes quickly.  With the hair brush cleaner, I can brush between the rows and get the excess hair and dirt out w/o having to disassemble the brush!!  It makes the job easy and quick!</li>
    <li> I love this brush cleaner. The pick makes it simple to clean the hair out of the brush. The bristles are very stiff and long so they fit all our brushes. It takes the lint out of the girl&#x27;s brushes so easily and fast. I used to have to soak their brushes and then pick the lent out by hand. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful tool for cleaning your brushes. Superior</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing the Denman Hair Brush Cleaner. And I realized this really came in handy! After using my Denman Classic Styling Brush, I would use the brush cleaner to help clean out the brush that&#x27;s filled with old hair! This is really neat! I would recommend this! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works for all Hair brush types. Great purchase for price.&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
    <li> This cleaner does a great job cleaning combs and brushes. Just what I needed</li>
    <li> I use this little hair brush cleaner every single day. It makes it so easy to keep my hair brush clean and to remove all of those long hairs that are so difficult to remove otherwise. It goes where your fingers never are able to get to, all of the little nooks and crannies where hairs love to hide in and get stuck in. I really love this little cleaner.</li>
    <li> Very effective brush cleaner.  All my brushes have plastic trimming on the ends and it make cleaning very difficult.  This lifts the trapped hair so that I could get to it and pull it out of the brush.  After a soaking in hot baking soda water, my brushes are free of hair and hair spray. and once again are clean.</li>
    <li> Grabs hairs very easily and is easy to clean afterwards. Sooo much better than other methods out there</li>
    <li> I have to tell you I haven&#x27;t use this very much but so far I&#x27;m pretty darn impressed.  I bought this because I goes through so many board bristle brush my have very thick wavy hair.  And cleaning the hair out of those brushes has always cause them to shed bristle this seems to work really really well so far so good</li>
    <li> DOES THE JOB WELL.  GREAT SELLER.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really realize what a half-a$$ed job I&#x27;d been doing on my brushes until I got this Denman Brush Cleaner.  You know - I was cleaning them the way my mother taught me - sink of soapy water; use a small-toothed comb, etc.  Holy cow!  The Denman got hair I didn&#x27;t know was still in my boar&#x27;s hair brush.  It seems like a silly thing to buy, but believe me - this brush cleaner is terrific.  Easy to use and comfortable to maneuver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only needed to use this item a few times since receiving it, and so far I like it. I&#x27;ve got some pretty course hair so the pointed tip is my best friend for cleaning my Denman brush. Also, the bristles on this cleaner are thick and firm, like a tough brush. I&#x27;ve only used it on my Denman brush which has wide set bristles, but all in all, it does the job just fine. I mean, you could get the same results with a rat tailed comb and a tough brush, but you&#x27;re killing two birds with one stone with this. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve tested it out enough to warrant that. Definite thumbs up though!</li>
