<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 3rd pregnancy.  Had some left over from #1 that I used for #2, so I used it sparingly because it was so expensive.  Anyway, needed more today.  Went back in my purchase history to find these jars.  What the heck?! So excited.  In 2011, pregnancy #1, I paid $30/jar.  Love that this is down to $19!  I have ZERO stretch marks.  I drink a lot of water and gain about 35lbs during pregnancy, which in sure has something to do with it.  I can&#x27;t use this everyday in the summer because it NEVER dries.  Because that&#x27;s super annoying, I use it every 3 days instead when it&#x27;s hot out.  Oh well.  I will still give it 5-stars because of the lowered price.</li>
    <li> Silky smooth on my baby bump!  You only need to use a little, so it is lasting a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I love the organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering baby lotion and protective ointment for the little one.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product. At 35weeks, no sign of stretch marks and looking forward to continuing to use this for the remainder and after pregnancy. Smells great</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily and haven&#x27;t had any strech marks so far into my second trimester, but the scent alone has me completely obsessed.  The lavender and orange is calming and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This body butter smells awesome and goes on easily. It seems to last all day too, with my skin feeling soft and moisturized. No stretch marks to speak of yet, but I&#x27;m only 27 weeks. I bought a second jar of this when my first ran out, and am about to run out again (and I typically only use it once per day). Just wish they sold bigger tubs.</li>
    <li> it use ok, smell is strong , but looks very cheap . don&#x27;t looks like made in USA , not worth 30 D</li>
    <li> We have tried plenty of organic/natural belly butters and this is the top pick.It is also the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it costs an arm and an leg so we started buying organic shea butter instead. You get way more for way cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically the same thing, but doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful like the Mambino brand.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels on my belly.  It is soft and mosturizing, but not greasy.  It also smells yummy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant and very interested in preventing stretch marks, so I&#x27;ve checked out a lot of different products.  I had really high hopes for this belly butter given the number of 5-star reviews, but I just can&#x27;t get past the ridiculous level of greasiness/stickiness. In the morning, I tried waiting nearly 20 minutes after applying before I got dressed, expecting it to sink in or mellow out somehow, but it was just as greasy/sticky as when freshly applied. (I was very concerned about putting on clothing over it!) By evening, I was STILL all greasy and sticky! It&#x27;s totally unreasonable for a product to remain greasy/sticky on the skin for over 12 hours.  Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a very strong orange-y smell -- reminds me of The Body Shop -- which I don&#x27;t particularly like, but the smell isn&#x27;t bad enough to write it off altogether.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. Your skin is so soft after using this. You can put it on at night or even in the day and it doesn&#x27;t have a powerful obnoxious scent to it like other products.  It is organic so it is safe for you and for your baby.  I will be buying more as soon as I run out!</li>
    <li> I really liked the citrus smell and the texture of this belly butter that made it easy to apply. I would have liked to continue using it, but after a few days of applying onto my belly, my belly started breaking out in tiny red pimples. I decided to re-challenge the allergy reaction after a few days, I still broke out. Needless to say, I had to stop using the product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Belly Butter!  It has an awesome smell and is really moisturizing!  I will definitely buy it again!  I am also going to purchase it as gifts for my pregnant friends as well!</li>
    <li> We love this cream. My wife is being using it for 3+ months. She was using a different brand and started to use this one after I gave it to her as a gift. She took a sniff after opening it and quickly fell in love. She has gone through 3 jars already! (yes, one per month!) It leaves her belly very soft and touchable and she is no longer complaining about skin dryness. Buying my forth jar today.</li>
    <li> PROS: nice citrus scent, lasts for a long time, took the itchiness away from my skin stretching.    CONS: even though i used this product religiously, i still got stretch marks (but to be fair, none of these products are scientifically proven to work.  stretch marks are more genetics than anything).  it took a while for me to get used to the greasy texture.  the price is high.</li>
    <li> This belly butter is very effective at healing dry, itchy skin and lightens stretch marks, gets easily absorbed and does not feel sticky. Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this a month ago. First off, I thought the jar was quite small for the price and the jar I received must have been in some type of heat becuase all the product was on one side of the jar. I used it faithfully for about one month now(began using it on the 6th today is the 2nd and the jar is gone.) yes it ran out fairly quickly and since I didnt even see slight results on my very red stretch marks so im skeptical to buy another jar given the price and the fact that it might be a big waste of my money. I gave it two stars becuase it did seem very moisturizing and smelled good. Idk maybe ill purchase again when I get my next check and see what happens. I really got my hopes up and didnt get quick results like other reviews had said.</li>
    <li> I used this belly butter throughout my pregnancy. I didn&#x27;t get a single stretchmark. It also reduced the itchiness and made the skin very soft. Stretchmarks occur due to many factors like food,skin type,care etc .So this did its job of keeping the skin very moisturized.I tried some other products too but none compared to this. Among all the ones I used, this belly butter was the one which kept my skin moisturized for a long time instead of reapplying it again and again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this belly butter! I am a petite woman (5&#x27;0 and pre-prego weight 100lbs) and when I became pregnant, I knew I was at risk for stretch marks. However, I purchased this and used it religiously during my pregnancy (2-3 times a day) and came out with not one single stretch mark. I recommend this to all my friends and it is working for them as well. Worth every penny!  UPDATE: Since my original review, I have since had two more pregnancies and the last included twins. I continued to use this and would you believe I am still stretch mark free! If you are on the fence about purchasing, I urge you... add it to your cart! Right. Now. Commit to using it twice a day and I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing I&#x27;ve accidentally come across EVER! With stretch marks a little bit of research goes a long way; however we can&#x27;t escape the fact that these wonderful marks are basically hereditary. If your mother had them chances are you will too. For this reason, prevention attempts seem rather futile, but women like to hold out hope. During my first pregnancy I tried the cocoa butter thing, taking vitamin E pills and even dabbing vitamin E oil on my tummy. None of it worked. My stretch marks were horrible. Over the years I considered Mederma, but figured it would turn out to be a waste and gave up. Losing weight helped the appearance some. The red centers faded, and the smaller lines became nothing more than light colored ripples. Still, I was never totally thrilled with the way the bigger ones looked. When I got pregnant a second time, I was so happy I barely considered what a growing fetus would do to my tummy. That changed during the middle of my sixth month. My mother, ever tactful, warned that if I didn&#x27;t put some sort of lotion on my growing belly my stretch marks would get stretch marks. I wanted to rebel in the worst way, but reality is inescapable. In a semi depressed state I turned to my friend amazon.com and found Mambino oh baby! belly butter. This organic product aids in the rebound and anti-stretch of skin. I&#x27;m not an organic nut, but it was a total selling point for me. I found the idea of putting something natural on my stomach more appealing then the latter. I&#x27;ve been using Belly Butter for almost three weeks now and the effects are A M A Z I N G! All, I repeat ALL, of my stretch marks are fading. New, old, red, white. Every single one of them is at least four times lighter than they were at the beginning of the pregnancy. Women get stretch marks for more reasons than just having baby, so pregnant or not you should give this product a try. It costs about thirty and change, but it&#x27;s so unbelievably worth it that even I (poor as poor can be) didn&#x27;t bat an eye while ordering my second jar. Do yourself a favor and try it out. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.can be) didn&#x27;t bat an eye while ordering my second jar. Do yourself a favor and try it out. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> A lot of reviews say there is a pro &amp; con about the smell. I wouldn&#x27;t go off this when purchasing the product because first of all the majority of us buying this are pregnant -we all have different sense tolerances. Lots of people hated the smell. I liked it. Not everyone is going to&amp;lots of people will so unless you have like a zero smell tolerance maybe really consider a non scented item if that&#x27;s really a concern. Second- this like a lot of belly butters is greasy. Not sure what vital ingredient is in them that makes it that way but from what I&#x27;ve seen in the different ones I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s like their iconic characteristic. Kinda have to deal with it. Third-I&#x27;m really annoyed with people saying that these products made it so they had no stretch marks. Everyone&#x27;s routine is different and products like this really can&#x27;t prevent someone from getting stretch marks. If someone who is pregnant is eating in excess or has a genetic disposition to have stretch marks, one who may not exercise, stay hydrated, or has excessive fat deposits in certain areas of their bodies will get stretch marks. Your body does things to adapt to change&amp;stretch marks are its way to adhere to rapid growth in the underlying tissues of the skin. With that said.. This product as well as others may HELP prevent additional stretch marks from forming or may reduce the appearance of current ones. There&#x27;s absolutely no harm in making a routine of moisturizing your skin because it can help. Just know that some things can be inevitable especially when it comes to the body because everyone is different. Lastly, I&#x27;ve used the cocoa butter formula belly butter but gave me pimples on my back. Even though I wasn&#x27;t even putting anything there. This time used this product and pimples have progressively gotten worse and spread. So thinking maybe it&#x27;s a rash or reaction. Skin tolerance is something to think about I guess. Other than that it seems like a good product !</li>
    <li> the smell was fine, but it&#x27;s in a waxy form. you have to rub it for a bit to get it on your hands, then to put it on your tummy. haven&#x27;t really used it too much since i generally want to apply and go!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan since the beginning and I&#x27;m not pregnant.  The products are organic and the delicious fruity scents are so addictive (but not overpowering).  I love the entire line:  Youth Glow, lip balm, body oil, shower gel and the Belly Butter of course.  The butter is easy to apply and not greasy. It smells so good that it makes me want to eat it.  The prices are reasonable and I feel so much better to know that the ingredients are natural and safe.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past several weeks and am addicted.  It smells fantastic, moisturizes well and I feel good knowing that I&#x27;m putting something on my skin that is free of chemicals and toxins.  I have been impressed with all the Mambino products I have tried, but this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product at ~20 wks pregnant and was using it twice a week until now (I am 37,5 wks now). Well, I got my stretch marks all over my belly past weekend - literally over 2 days. The product smells nice, it is somewhat non-greasy (still, do not plan on getting dressed right after you put it on), it is organic, but it does not work! Well, maybe it would have been worse had I not used it, but there is no way to test it now. So maybe they are right, and it is all genetics, no matter what you rub into your belly. Oh, I gained 35lb and I was very fit and healthy prior to my pregnancy (and somewhat during it :) -- I started out 5ft6, 115 lb.   Good luck to everyone and maybe look elsewhere for a good stretch mark prevention butter.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful belly butter. I look forward to my morning ritual of warming the butter in my hands, smelling the light fragrant scent and smoothing it over my belly. Very natural, scent is perfect and not synthetic, not sticky, keeps my skin soft all day. So far, no stretch marks, but probably genetic luck. Will be purchasing more of their products after pregnancy!</li>
    <li> This product does leave you feeling greasy but also hydrated which is what&#x27;s important to me these 9 months. So, you will be putting your clothes on over a greasy belly and hips but it hasn&#x27;t stained my clothes or left any residue on them! And it soaks in over time, so you don&#x27;t feel it too long. Smells good too, which is more than I can say for shea butter I have! Can&#x27;t say it has prevented stretch marks but can&#x27;t say it hasn&#x27;t, I use this along with a pure shea butter, another belly butter, and a shea/vitamin E combo from bath and body that I love because it is less greasy so I use that mid-day. I do not have any stretch marks so far but who knows what plain old genetics may have in store for me....</li>
    <li> I am a man but you dont need to be pregnant to get stretch marks. I get them without gaining or losing anything because i have a skin disorder that causes lots of skin problems. I bought this based on some research i did on the butters found in this and how they seem to be the best thing for stretchmarks and certain other skin issues. It is hard to find anything with all of them in one product this is the only one i found that is 100% all  natural.  It feels so nice on my skin i actually started using small amounts on my face as a moisturizer before i go to sleep and it soothes my dry sensitive skin. Also this stuff smells good enough to eat. This company really knows what they are doing. I am going to buy this for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over two years since I found out I was expecting. Now, we have a beautiful 15m old girl and I have NO stretch marks to prove it! The belly butter was incredible! When I was pregnant I used it everyday and also used the oil after I showered followed by the belly butter. I love that it&#x27;s all natural with simple organic ingredients and it works! Every expectant Mom should use this product!</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday - it smells great and spreads well over my huge tummy (I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant).  So far, no stretch marks and my skin stays soft thanks to this Belly Butter.  I highly recommend using this product!</li>
    <li> This belly butter comes out of the jar a little firm, but once you warm it in your hands, it goes on very smooth and makes my skin very soft. It has a very light nice scent</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! I started using this belly butter when I was 12 weeks pregnant. I am 38 weeks now and absolutely no stretch marks. I also have not had a problem with dry or itchy skin.  I have gained 28 pounds and have a big baby belly. I am very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Mambino products! I use the Oh Baby! Belly Butter in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B00112YX68 Mambino Organics Moisture Me Body Toning Oil - 6 oz / 180 ml (*made with Certified Organic ingredients)]].I am currently 9 months pregnant and nothing has worked better. I could feel a real difference from the products I was using previously during the beginning of my pregnancy. Once I used the Mambino products (which I originally received as a gift) there was no going back! These smell and feel fantastic and so far I have had no issues with stretch marks or itching. They are effective and organic so they safe for you and your baby. I will definitely continue to use both products post pregnancy.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for a few months, am stretch mark/blemish free, and it not only smells good, but feels really substantial...now that i&#x27;m running low, i&#x27;m alternating with a cheaper product and there&#x27;s a huge difference both immediately upon application and hours later...definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> After trying several different products during my first trimester, this was the first one that I could tolerate the smell (like oranges!), so it was the one I used.  I loved it!!!  I carried my baby to 40 weeks, with no stretch marks.  They say it&#x27;s genetic, but all of the other women in my family have stretch marks, so I still credit this belly butter.  I buy it for all of my pregnant friends.  I also use the toning oil, which I like even when I&#x27;m not pregnant!  Would highly recommend both products!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since my first trimester and have no marks yet on my belly, but do have some on my hips. I like the scent of this and the texture, although, as others have mentioned it is really greasy.  I have to wait to get dressed after putting it on, or risk getting it all over my clothes, which has happened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several body butters and creams and this is just the best one as far as \\&quot;feel\\&quot; and \\&quot;smell\\&quot;.  The fact that it is all natural and organic reassures me further that its a great product.  I just ordered the toning oil and a lip balm so i&#x27;m excited to try them.  This item ships right away.... it is a little pricey but worth it!  I&#x27;m 28 weeks and almost done with my second tub so it does go fast, but so far not a stretch mark in sight! Definitely worth trying... you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Oh Baby Belly Butter along with the Mambino Moisture Me Toning Oil throughout my 3rd trimester of pregnancy. I use it once daily, after showering. I apply it after the toning oil. The belly butter has a nice smell. I do try to air dry for a few minutes after applying. Neither product has stained or left any residues on my clothes. My skin hasn&#x27;t been itchy and I don&#x27;t have any apparent stretch marks (though I&#x27;m doubtful that any product can truly have any impact on stretch marks). I really like this belly butter and plan on continuing using it postpartum. Note: Originally I bought the Mambino Organics Bun in the Oven set, just to try out the products. The toning oil and belly butter used together both lasted about 1 month.</li>
    <li> It did help but oiler then I thought</li>
    <li> Oh, man, this thing smells delicious! It does take a little while to work it all in, but you forget about it as soon as that sweet smell fills your nostrils.</li>
    <li> I agree with one of the recent reviews about this product because I experienced the same thing.  PROS: This product has a citrus sweet smell and it stops new stretch marks from appearing.  CONS: Little red dots started appearing all over my belly.  I used a different product for about two weeks and the dots disappeared.  Then I went back to using the Mambino and the red dots appeared again.</li>
    <li> I am concerned about the safety of this product for pregnant women.  You can find many sources that say Rosemary essential oil should not be used during pregnancy.  I think one should err on the side of caution while pregnant &amp; they should remove the Rosemary and substitute with an oil that is considered safe.</li>
    <li> From the fist time I used the product I fell in love with it, and about a month and a half later I love it even more!  It is incredibly soft, gentle and relaxing.... and I do not want to use any other products....  I am just getting into my second trimester and I plan on using this product throughout my pregnancy and beyond....  Simply, I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I had no stretch marks with my first child (6# 13 oz) using Palmers lotion twice daily.  I got stretch marks at 37 weeks with my second child (8# 5 oz) using Palmers lotion so I tried this product with child number 3.  I rubbed it on 3 times daily and had absolutely NO additional stretch marks with my third child (8# 13 oz)! It doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as some other lotions so I would walk around with my shirt up while I got ready for work or bed, but it was well worth the extra effort for no stretch marks! Also, it smells delicious - like citrus fruit.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!! I used it everyday of my pregnancy. I am 2 month&#x27;s post and still using it!! I have no stretch marks and super soft skin! The best part is, its all organic so you are not harming your unborn baby.  I highly recommend using this product!  [[ASIN:B00112RH9I Mambino Organics Oh Baby! Belly Butter 4oz / 114g ~ Winner! Disney&#x27;s iParenting Media Award; Outstanding Product]]</li>
    <li> I use it religiously. It totally works. Not a single stretch mark, and it smells so heavenly that I look forward to putting it on! Great ingredients as well, of course!</li>
    <li> I used this cream with my second pregnancy and I would not recommend it.  I liked the smell and the texture was fine but it was pretty oily. The real reason I would not recommend it was because my belly was always itchy! I was never itchy my first pregnancy.  I would recommend the mama mio products, I used those my first pregnancy and yes they were a little more expensive but well with it.</li>
    <li> Love this belly butter! Been using it for my entire pregnancy. I tried to switch to other products but came back to Mambino very quickly...the other products I tried make my belly itch. Apply twice a day and buy mutliples once you try it out...one lasts about a month if applied twice a day. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Did not know the effect on the stomach before no long lines , some long overnight , are now being used , do not know how the final results</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for magical stretch mark powers (my understanding is creams don&#x27;t really make a difference) but I love the body oil and belly butter from mambino. They smell like oranges and really help with itching.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had zero stretch marks during my pregnancy! I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was 10 weeks pregnant, currently 31 weeks! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried several kinds of stretch mark prevention during my pregnancy, this is my favorite.  It smells great, it rubs in well and makes the skin soft.  I haven&#x27;t had the itchiness.</li>
    <li> Almost 29 weeks and love this stuff!  At about 20 weeks, I started seeing the first little beginnings of a stretch mark on my belly, despite my daily use of shea and coconut lotion.  Have been using this twice daily ever since and am very pleased to say that no new stretch marks have developed.  I am wishing I had this as a girl growing up when I developed stretch marks from growth spurts!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  It&#x27;s extremely greasy and takes a little while to absorb.  You have to wash your hands after using it. I only ended up with a couple stretch marks towards the end. I didn&#x27;t use this religiously however.  I used it a lot but I know I did not use it 2x a day, especially towards the end (which is when I probably should have).  Not sure if this would have really prevented the ones that I ended up with or not...</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee body balm and the Mama Bee body oil.  I was two months when I started applying them alternately after showers.  After a while rash began to appear on my belly.  My doctor told me it&#x27;s kind of normal and not to worry.  The rash may not be related to the products, but I found that using more of my old body lotion and sometimes the Mambino belly butter or Burt&#x27;s Bees body oil makes my rash appear less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the texture and the smell of Mambino&#x27;s belly butter.  The butter is like solidified cream and is easier to scoop with a finger -- much easier than a balm -- and it quickly melts in my palm and on my belly.  It is not as greasy as a balm, either.  Its lemony mango smell always puts me in a good mood.  Now I use this butter or Burt&#x27;s Bees body oil whenever I need a quick aroma therapy.  As far as stretch mark goes, I was told that it was in your genes and had not much to do with what you put on your belly (I don&#x27;t have any yet but fingers crossed), but I would love to think that by putting on something nurishing I was doing my job :)  I definitely would love to use this product more often if not bothered by pregnancy rash.</li>
    <li> I used Palmers belly butter for my first pregnancy, and had no stretch marks. But one review this time around scared me about extra junk put in the Palmers formula, so I went for this butter for this pregnancy. Smells amazing and is very thick and rich, which I like. So far so good. Do belly butters really work? Who knows, but feels good to at least try to avoid stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter who was expecting her first child in June.  She used it every day and loved the scent and feel of this belly butter.  When I did a plaster cast of her belly the day before she gave birth, I did not see one stretch mark!  It definitely works!</li>
    <li> This stuff helps my ever growing belly from itching.  I had stretch marks from my last pregnancy, but we will see if this helps keep them at bay.  So far, so good, but I still have three more months.  5 Stars thus far for smell, and being all natural.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing! I am 38 weeks and my stomach looks perfect. I gained weight at 22 y/o and have really, really bad stretch marks all over my hips and thighs. Now I&#x27;m 34 and pregnant with my 1st (40 lb weight gain) and I haven&#x27;t gotten one, not even a little one. I didn&#x27;t think I could avoid it considering my history and family history of them but I truly believe this product is a miracle worker. I did get little red bumps the first couple months but I&#x27;ll take temporary red bumps over permanent stretch marks any day. The smell was great to me, a little citrusy, not bad at all. I want to kiss the person who made this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on reviews on here.  I found it to be not greasy - and wonder if the people that have said it is have used to much of it at a time?  I tried to use it sparingly and found it soaked in and was fine to put clothes on pretty quickly after with no residue.  The smell was ok - my husband didn&#x27;t really like it. It was very citrus like - someone mentioned Body Shop type smell which I&#x27;d agree with.  I don&#x27;t mind it, it&#x27;s very light.  As to whether it works long term I will have to wait till my next pregnancy as this was my first and sadly I lost the baby.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and love that it&#x27;s all organic/natural etc so even on that alone and the non greasiness I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Using it each day and as at 25 weeks pregnant no stretch marks at all. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for about three days now, but the smell is wonderful and it&#x27;s not really greasy or oily at all. It seems to absorb quickly and I wake up with very smooth and soft skin. I had tried Palmer&#x27;s Tummy Butter for a few days but developed a horrible rash from it, so I am was glad to find this one that is organic and without all the chemicals that Palmer&#x27;s has. The mango/citrus scent is really nice. I will definitely purchase more for the rest of my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I put it on after my shower and it lasts all day, no itching. One tub lasts about two months and I use about 2 to 3 tsps daily. The smell of orange is not overpowering to my ultra sensitive nose. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this along with the toner. These two items are a must have if you are pregnant and trying to not get any stretch marks. Stretch marks run in my family so I need the best stuff and this really is the best stuff! I&#x27;m using this on my 2nd pregnancy and trust me, if I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks the first time, I won&#x27;t be getting them the second. BUT you have to actually use it! Some people get it, use it lazily and then blaime the product for their negligence. Use it morning and night!</li>
    <li> I ordered this stuff because it was the only one where I could identify every ingredient on the label.  That was a big plus.  I like the texture -- it melts in your hands into a sort of oil and goes on smoothly.  I can&#x27;t speak for whether it works because I am only 21 weeks pregnant and not that big yet.  But I don&#x27;t know that I will ever find out because I have to force myself to use it.  The smell is just too strong.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but it&#x27;s not pleasant either.  It&#x27;s a bit sharp and acidic (citrus?).  If I put it on before bed I am smelling it all night.  If I put it on in the morning I am smelling it all day.  I find myself avoiding using it.  I also don&#x27;t like scented deodorants or lotions and I don&#x27;t wear perfume so maybe I am extra picky.  A lot of people here seem to like the smell.  Anyway I just wish it was a bit less intense.</li>
    <li> I am now 31 weeks pregnant and still no stretch marks.  I have been using this product for about 3 months now.  I also use Palmers cocoa butter massage cream right before I put this on though. I think the two products have different enough ingredients to cover a broad spectrum of what may or may not work for stretch marks.  I know stretch marks are supposed to be mostly genetic but I have such dry skin as it is and it is the middle of winter right now.  Besides I&#x27;d rather be safe than sorry.  This stuff is expensive but it lasts a while.  You only need a little and really goes a long way.  Let it melt in your hands before applying.  It can be greasy and if you are wearing a silky shirt it will probably leave a stain (which is washable).  My pregnancy craving happens to be citrus so to me this stuff smells delicious, like orange blossoms!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got this when I did.  I was starting to get stretch marks.  I had the first signs of elongated red lines.  I have been using this 1-2 times a day and any time my skin looks a little irritated.  The stretch marks have disappeared and my skin is less irritated overnight.  The fragrance is a little strong at first, not unpleasant though to me, but dissipates after a while.  Also, one of my dogs loves to lick it off of the back of my hands so I feel so much better that I am using an all natural product</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m pregnant and it&#x27;s the only stuff I&#x27;ve tried that holds the moisture for at least 24 hours. It has a night pleasant smell. I go through it pretty quick, but think it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Works really well!! With the rapid growth during pregnancy, I feel like this product is a MUST have!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this belly butter for my daughter who just had a baby.  She was a fanatic about moisturizing while her tummy grew from day one to avoid stretch marks.  She was very lucky and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks!  She purchased literally hundreds of dollars worth of top notch belly oils, butters and creams and applied several times a day/night.  This one was her favorite by far, she went thru 4 jars of just this alone.</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvement during and after pregnancy with this lotion. I had high hopes due to reviews and description. I personally think it is just expensive lotion. I would not recommend. I tried this, palmers, baby belly, and a few others and did not see a difference using this.</li>
    <li> I love this product when pregnant.  I used this during my first pregnancy and now for my second.  It does leave you feeling a little greased up, but for me, I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks so, I&#x27;m willing to deal with the super moisturizing result. I would also give it a flew minutes before putting on clothes, particularly white items. Only reason I didn&#x27;t 5-star it has to do with whatever happened during the shipping of a couple jars.  I live overseas currently and had to have it shipped APO (which I&#x27;m thankful the company even does) and this particular time is during hot summer months.  I picked the item up from the post office and took it home immediately in an AC car.  What I noticed is that it must have melted somewhere along the way.  When I used it, it was not the smooth version I was use to, but rather a grainy texture that once massaged in, still had the same result as the non-melted, but it was a lot less appealing to deal with.  I could have complained to amazon or company that sponsored and maybe they would replace, but frankly, just too busy...so beware of temp.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells great and really moisturizes. I have bought it for myself and as a gift. I should mention that it is rather greasy. This doesn&#x27;t bother me, but may bother some.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this belly butter. I&#x27;m 33 weeks and have used it once a day since 18 weeks and have zero stretch marks so far. It smells great and feels great on skin. It does not all get soaked up, but that&#x27;s a good thing as it keeps skin soft all day. The 2nd tub I purchased of it was grainy, compared to my 1st tub which was not, but it is a natural product so I&#x27;d trade a smooth chemical-filled product any day for this one. I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: had zero, I repeat zero stretch marks. Yeah yeah good genes and all that but I seriously credit this belly butter. My skin never even itched, and my weirdo sister who used to kiss my prego belly all the time used to always tell me how good my belly smelled. I actually miss using this stuff. Just bought a tub for my knocked up BFF!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF !! It smells great, feels great, goes a long way. I found this with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark. So as soon as I found out I was expecting again I purchased another jar !! I tell all my friends who are expecting about this product and most have ended up purchasing some and all who have love it as well.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife, and she loves it.  It really seems to have helped her through so far.  Smells nice!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my friend who has two kids. She didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks during both of her pregnancies and was super happy with this butter. She told me she only used it once a day after taking shower. I did the same and for a while I was extremely pleased with Baby Belly Butter. At 35 weeks I didn&#x27;t have one stretch mark and I really started to believe that I would avoid them altogether. Then all of a sudden I noticed red stretch marks on one of my butt cheeks, they appeared out of nowhere and are really stubborn. Although they are small and really not that bad, they still annoy me. I was so hoping that this product would prevent me from getting them, especially taking into account how expensive this butter is, but oh well. I might have not used it enough, because I was supposed to use it twice a day and I used it only once a day but I applied this stuff religiously through out my pregnancy. I think it smells wonderful and unlike other people I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that greasy, I just wish that it would have worked for me. I will continue using it for a while because I still have two jars left, but honestly I don&#x27;t have high hopes for it anymore : )</li>
    <li> No idea if this will work in the long run but so far it goes on smooth and smells fantastic!  Wish the product size was bigger but it will do for now.</li>
    <li> It feels sticky in your belly after applying but it doesn&#x60;t really bother me because later it feels so good and moisturized! Would buy it again...</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, absorbs well. I went through 4 of these tubs during my pregnancy and will continue to use after baby arrives.</li>
    <li> I really like this belly butter - it has a lot of awesome and quality ingredients (17 weeks and still no stretch marks - keeping my fingers crossed!). I&#x27;m only giving it one less star because of the price (it&#x27;s $$$) and because of the smell. It has a really nice yummy smell but I just get sick of it after a while because I prefer lotions/butters with a very light to no smell. For example, the smell of coconut oil doesn&#x27;t bother me - but this is a lot stronger.</li>
    <li> This is my second pregnancy. I managed to get through without stretch marks last time but I didn&#x27;t love the lotions I was using - a little too slimy and smelly, and they stained. This became even more apparent when I pulled out my maternity clothes this time around. This one, on the other hand, smells good and rubs in easily without being greasy. I haven&#x27;t noticed any stains except possibly on the reverse side of my clothes (but nothing that shows through). I think the thing I like best about it is that I actually want to use it rather than feeling like it&#x27;s just another hassle. It is on the pricey side, but for around $50 (2 containers) for the entire pregnancy and postpartum period, it&#x27;s well worth it.    Update: No stretch marks post baby despite having gained 37 pounds! And I didn&#x27;t tire of the smell.</li>
    <li> Smell good but quite pricy! It doesn&#x27;t give off any sticky feeling. However, I still ended up getting stretch mark on my belly at the end of my pregnancy and I put it on twice a day. Kinda disappointed.</li>
    <li> This did give me a rash. Wanted to like it but discontinued use.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - and now I buy it for everyone that I know is pregnant.  I actually got a rash from the stuff in the store (when I ran out of the small size that I got as a gift).  It smells great, goes on smooth, and this larger size lasts a whole pregnancy applying once-twice a day.</li>
    <li> Seems wonderful so far! I&#x27;ve only been using it very shortly, however so far so good! I ordered 3, seeming that it was only 4 ounces. Now that I have it in person, &amp;#34;a little goes a long way.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I did not get get stretch marks during my pregnancy but in the last five weeks my skin was stretched to the max and started getting really dry and flakey.  This saved me. It cured my dry skin by the second use and I just love the way it smells and feels though it is not too perfumey. I am going to buy this for every pregnant woman I know.</li>
    <li> I like this product and have now bought it for my second pregnancy but I just opened mine and it was melted out of the jar into the lid and box. I am very disappointed because this product is not that cheap for the small amount you are getting.</li>
    <li> I like this product. The smell is a little weird. Not bad, but not great. You have to rub it between your hands to heat/soften it before applying. I am on what I think is my third or fourth jar of this stuff, but this particular one seems a bit off. The consistency is much grainier than the ones I&#x27;d received before. Oh, and I should mention that the smell made my aunt&#x27;s nose tickle (seemed to trigger some sort of allergy).</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It smells great, feels great and lasts all day.  So far at 25 weeks, no stretch marks despite my being extremely prone to getting them.  I do wish it came in a bigger size so I wouldn&#x27;t have to reorder so often, using it once a day it has lasted about a month or so.  Worth it though to find something that works for my extremely sensitive skin that still smells good!    Update: I got through my entire pregnancy without a single new stretch mark! I give this stuff full credit because I have gotten stretch marks with weight gain in the past, and this butter even helped those fade!  I gained 40 pounds with my pregnancy and have continued using it since the baby arrived, to help make sure no stretch marks appear as I lose the weight.  This will be my go-to gift for any pregnant friends in the future!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! It smells awesome and works great :) it&#x27;s well worth the price and requires just a dab twice a day.</li>
    <li> I used daily during my pregnancy along with the toning oil and I don&#x27;t have one stretch mark!  Would def use again.</li>
    <li> Ordered this belly butter since I&#x27;ve use it before and liked it very much! In retail it sells $30 I got it from amazon $15 so I ended up getting two of them.  It&#x27;s kind of pricy for 4 oz jar.&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened it wasn&#x27;t sealed air tight like my retail one was and instead of dark yellow color of the butter it&#x27;s more of a yellowish white and it doesn&#x27;t smell has good and citrusy. I&#x27;ll keep using it but I have a feeling it&#x27;s not the original formula or it&#x27;s not the real Oh Baby! Belly Butter</li>
    <li> I used this product in the morning and night from 20 weeks of my pregnancy and delivered my daughter full term 9 pounds without a single strech mark! Amazing results you wont regret!</li>
    <li> It’s expensive as all get out, but it feels &amp; smells just perfect. My Husband put it on my belly every night of my pregnancy, &amp; I will never forget how a body butter suddenly became special &amp; something I looked forward to every day.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to say it took away all my itchies, &amp; it did for most of the time, but at a certain point nothing could calm them completely except homemade oat baths.&lt;br /&gt;I still got stretch marks, but they aren&#x27;t as bad as expected. I really believe this stuff made a difference.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I am still still using it after giving birth and have NO stretch marks!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this belly butter! With slow and steady weight gain, a healthy diet and Mambino Organics Belly Butter, I made it thru my pregnancy with no stretch marks!!</li>
    <li> If you like greasy then this is the product for you.  It takes a very long time to absorb, so if you get dressed immediately after, it can get on your clothes.  You really have to use force to dig into this product to extract any of it from the container and it comes out clumpy and hard and then the heat of your skin turns it into grease. It has a stale citrus scent. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> So when I got pregnant I did a lot of research to find something to put on my body to attempt to combat stretch marks and help with itchy, stretching skin. I came across this one and decided this was gonna be it. Well I went through the whole jar rather quickly- I lathered that stuff on, I wasn&#x27;t playing around with stretch marks. Well it was nice and felt good and the smell didn&#x27;t bother me. A little oily feeling and sometimes it left my shirt looking kinda wet. I was about to run out when I started looking into either buying more of this or trying something else. Well I ended up getting burts bees mamma bee belly butter and body oil. I loved it. It had no smell and the cream was nice and thick but not too much so that it felt greasy or anything. I would put the oil on after my shower then lube up with the lotion after. I went through about 8 tubes of the butter and two or thee bottles of oil throughout my pregnancy. I started applying about 12 weeks in. I dont know if it was the lotions, genetics or what but I didn&#x27;t end up with any stretch marks. Yay!!!</li>
    <li> I like the smell but, has not done anything for current stretch marks. I have been using daily for 2 months now. I am always looking for some miracle cream but am left still looking....</li>
    <li> I am currently 35 weeks pregnant and have been using this for about a month now and I love it. It is a very thick butter that you will need to warm up with your hands in order to spread on your belly but it moisturizes and sinks into the skin in just a couple of minutes. I use this after my shower in the morning and at night and I have not found it to stain any of my clothes or sheets.  Prior to this I was using the Burts Bees belly oil and it was good but I wanted to try a butter to see if it would work well on my dry skin. So far so good and no stretch marks yet!</li>
    <li> The product is very hydrating but the texture is awful! It&#x27;s very think and corse. Like a thick sugar scrub. Once you rub it in your hands for a little while it warms up and becomes a smooth texture but then random chucks are all over your hands still corse and rough. I will not be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This was awesome stuff, did not get one stretch mark through my whole pregnancy. Great smell, kind of greasy, but worked so great on the skin leaving it feel so soft.</li>
    <li> Great product. Skin stays moisturized all day long. A little bit goes a long way too</li>
    <li> Seems it makes my skin better than before. :-D</li>
    <li> Lovely smell, nice texture.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a gift and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This product smells  wonderful,  the citrus scent makes it a lovely  morning  rub. It glides on and makes my skin feel very soft.  I&#x27;m entering my fifth month and have been using this specific product for a month (I have been using different skin oils for my stomach since I got the plus symbol on the ept stick).  Let&#x27;s be honest ladies, stretch  marks are what they are if you  put  on the baby  weight swiftly &amp;/or  you are just genetically predisposed to get them  you could swim  in this product (or others) and STILL earn your tiger stripes. So I harbor no illusions that this product is the reason I am currently (note I say currently still have plenty of time to add to my stretch marks on my legs from growing tall quickly) stretch mark free.&lt;br /&gt;I  live in Nevada  and this is wonderful for moisturizing my skin  and I know it helps keep my skin from itching like crazy as it stretches. I  harbor no illusions that this cream is the  reason I have not started getting stretch marks.  I have a long torso and I  have put on baby weight slowly and I can only hope that holds out.  I  didn&#x27;t give this product 5  stars because of the price, there is no  reason such a small amount should cost so much. I  may buying in the future  just because I like the smell, but I also know I can pick up a basic massage type oil or cocoa butter or shea butter and it will give me the same moisture level.</li>
