      <li>Awesome!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>Just perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I use it for blending after a spray tan and it turns out wonderful.</li>
      <li>The mitt was great but store didn&#x27;t  sell anymore</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE these tanning Mitts!</li>
      <li>Yap, nice one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find that it glides very easily on my skin when applying either</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it applies any better than using latex gloves or hands.</li>
      <li>works ok, the tanning lotion soaks into the glove more than I would like it to.</li>
      <li>..found these and am 100% satisfied .</li>
      <li>I love these mitts.</li>
      <li>Falls apart easily and bleeds through onto your hand.</li>
      <li>The easy to come off and move around.</li>
      <li>Otherwise its easy to use your thumb to keep it on.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy how evenly this spreads product.</li>
      <li>They make self tanning super easy and hassle free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using self tanner for so long but hadn&#x27;t been able to find a good application mitt until I got these.</li>
      <li>Love how soft these are and how smooth my self tanner goes on with these!</li>
      <li>It is nice to have these in general</li>
      <li>The st. tropez is very foamy feeling and doesn&#x27;t absorb much, which is great for not wasting your product, but the Reneetan is thinner than the fake bake mitt, which is all cloth and very tick, which is great for washing and reusing, but it will soak up a lot of the tanner and thus it takes more to saturate the mitt and not your skin.</li>
      <li>I find that the majority of the lotion is absorbed through the pad than on my face.  </li>
      <li>I am not crazy about this tanning mitt.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to find the right Mitt for my self tanner.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and last longer than the mitts that come with the tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Super soft and really helps to blend in your self tanner.</li>
      <li>Much nicer than some of the ones that come with the tanning lotion</li>
      <li>Honestly, it really holds up in comparison.</li>
      <li>Paid this much for 1 mitt a couple of years ago.</li>
      <li>I was able to get such an even application with such ease because of these mitts.</li>
      <li>Soft &amp; did the job!</li>
      <li>I find when I&#x27;m blending it slides right off, so I have to use it upside down in order for it to not fall off.</li>

    <li> Perfect!  Just what i was looking for</li>
    <li> Yap, nice one. Just perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I have used many mitts before and here i am comparing the fake bake mitt, st. tropez mitt and this Reneetan mitt. Honestly, it really holds up in comparison. I like the feeling of the mit, it feels thick and silky. The st. tropez is very foamy feeling and doesn&#x27;t absorb much, which is great for not wasting your product, but the Reneetan is thinner than the fake bake mitt, which is all cloth and very tick, which is great for washing and reusing, but it will soak up a lot of the tanner and thus it takes more to saturate the mitt and not your skin. I recommend this mitt.</li>
    <li> Love how soft these are and how smooth my self tanner goes on with these!</li>
    <li> Much nicer than some of the ones that come with the tanning lotion</li>
    <li> I find that the majority of the lotion is absorbed through the pad than on my face.  I don&#x27;t find that it glides very easily on my skin when applying either and I use regular lotion and tanning lotion mixed together.  It is nice to have these in general but I don&#x27;t think it applies any better than using latex gloves or hands.</li>
    <li> works ok, the tanning lotion soaks into the glove more than I would like it to.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to keep the Mitt on your hand while applying Self tanners.The easy to come off and move around.I was hoping to find the right Mitt for my self tanner.</li>
    <li> Falls apart easily and bleeds through onto your hand.</li>
    <li> Have used twice and one mit is already coming apart</li>
    <li> I really enjoy how evenly this spreads product. I use it for blending after a spray tan and it turns out wonderful. One thing I dislike about the product is it&#x27;s hard to keep on your hand. I find when I&#x27;m blending it slides right off, so I have to use it upside down in order for it to not fall off.

    <li> AMAZING!!! I absolutely LOVE these tanning Mitts! Super soft and really helps to blend in your self tanner. You can also wash them and let them dry to extend there use.</li>

    <li> I love these mitts. I&#x27;ve been using self tanner for so long but hadn&#x27;t been able to find a good application mitt until I got these. I was able to get such an even application with such ease because of these mitts. They make self tanning super easy and hassle free. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I am not crazy about this tanning mitt. It slides around on my hand as I am trying to apply my sunless lotion.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Soft &amp; did the job!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Makes each of self tanning mousse and lotion a breeze. Paid this much for 1 mitt a couple of years ago. The mitt was great but store didn&#x27;t  sell anymore..found these and am 100% satisfied . Made with quality</li>
