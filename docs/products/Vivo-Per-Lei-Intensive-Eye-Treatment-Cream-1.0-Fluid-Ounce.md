      <li>I was very excited to try this product.  </li>
      <li>The scent and texture are amazing and at first I was thrilled.  </li>
      <li>The prices at the Hotel for the product was in the hundreds of dollars and I would never have considered spending that much money, however, when I saw it on amazon for a more than fair price</li>
      <li>As far as I know, she&#x27;s happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I did not notice any great diminishing of dark circles but as a moisturizing eye cream it was effective.</li>
      <li>After a month of use I feel like my fine lines are smoother</li>
      <li>A lot cheaper but too light of a cream for me.</li>
      <li>This product has not disappointed me.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought it for my crows feet.</li>
      <li>Review \\&quot;product was great\\&quot; excited.</li>
      <li>Given the option between this product and the Vivo per Lei Anti-aging eye serum,  I will continue to use the serum and a good moisturizer to achieve same results.</li>
      <li>It is nice on the skin, soothing and smoothing on the sensitive eye area.  </li>
      <li>The cream applies well and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I will purchase from a more reputable site next time.</li>
      <li>However, this does not reflect on the seller, who had the product at my home quickly.</li>
      <li>PRODUCT WAS SENT QUICKLY -</li>
      <li>this product was well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about it.  </li>
      <li>I was so surprised that I was able to purchase it through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it has miracle properties, but I do think it is better than other OTC brands and worth the amazon price for sure.  </li>
      <li>BUT DON&#x27;T THINK IT&#x27;S AS GOOD AS OTHER EYE CREAMS -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but irratates my eyes, makes them red and kinda itchy</li>
      <li>At this point I can&#x27;t recommended, I have not being consistent using it</li>
      <li>First time ever for an eye cream.  </li>
      <li>It works just as well as the higher price brand.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Olay. intermingled with higher end products, for years</li>
      <li>Well, skin is pretty resilient and I have never had an issue with beauty products.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have use minerals from the sea in a product.</li>
      <li>Wondering if this is the real Vivo or did I get a Bogus bottle.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t convinced that it really did anything.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really say it would reduce puffiness, but because of the name, I thought maybe it would.</li>
      <li>I AM USING THE DAY LOTION AND REALLY LIKE THAT</li>
      <li>I DO NOT SEE MUCH IMPROVEMENT</li>
      <li>Get the same results with any cheap eye cream.</li>
      <li>I have not seen much of a difference with those?</li>
      <li>I would buy this product again and also reccomend it highly!</li>
      <li>It is still too early to tell whether this product is better than others I have used, but I like it just the same.  </li>
      <li>it looked like it was full, but there is nothing in the middle!!  </li>
      <li>so I took the top off and could see all the way down to the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Volume for this product better than the eye serum but still only half full.</li>
      <li>I need to give it a little bit more time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s half full when opened!</li>
      <li>When I received this, it was barely half full!  </li>
      <li>Use it daily with the moisturizing cream and the difference is very noticeable.  </li>
      <li>It makes your skin around your eyes soft and refreshed.</li>
      <li>Surely not up to standards of good Dead Sea products.  </li>
      <li>Okay, but the packaging of the product makes the last amount of it, hard to get out.</li>
      <li>Targets the fine lines around the delicate eye area.</li>

    <li> Nothing impressive about product.</li>
    <li> Okay, but the packaging of the product makes the last amount of it, hard to get out. Felt as though i may have wasted dollars. However, this does not reflect on the seller, who had the product at my home quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product, really great price.  Use it daily with the moisturizing cream and the difference is very noticeable.  It&#x27;s been an excellent product for me and it works.</li>
    <li> Omg this Eye Cream was wonderful. Kelly</li>
    <li> This product was only half-full when i opened it. The consistence/feel of it was differernt from previous product I have used...</li>
    <li> This eye treatment has been great. After a month of use I feel like my fine lines are smoother and I also feel my eyes are hydrated.</li>
    <li> I started using this product as soon as I received it. It makes your skin around your eyes soft and refreshed. I use this cream along with the serum. They are a nice pair. I have seen a diminish in the black circles around my eyes. I originally bought it for my crows feet. I have not seen much of a difference with those? I will keep using and see if there is a change. I need to give it a little bit more time. This is the first time I have use minerals from the sea in a product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference in my appearance. Wondering if this is the real Vivo or did I get a Bogus bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to buying $70 eye cream and when I tried the peel this brand has and loved it I wanted to try more of their products. It&#x27;s ok. A lot cheaper but too light of a cream for me.</li>
    <li> Review \\&quot;product was great\\&quot; excited. Used it for 6 weeks. Results was disappointing. No improvement of skin tighten and the dark circle under my eyes were worse. So I guess you are wondering why I gave it a five stars rating? When I got it I thought \\&quot;huh\\&quot; maybe it will also work on my chicken neck since both skin types are kind of the same. The results was amazing. Five stars are for the amazing job it did for my neck. Glad I tried it there. Glad I didn&#x27;t know I could not send it back after tried it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s half full when opened!</li>
    <li> This cream is way too thick which means you have to really rub your skin to get it on. that isn&#x27;t good for aging skin. I would not recommend this to purchase for face skin care.</li>
    <li> this product was well worth the price.  It works just as well as the higher price brand.  I will buy again</li>
    <li> I HAVE TO HAVE MY VIVO! Hands Down for eyes! VIVO is the way to go!</li>
    <li> This entire product line is wonderful. With continued use it keeps my skin looking better than any of the many, many products I have tried.</li>
    <li> This product is highly effective at diminishing the appearance of fine lines.  It also feels great on my skin.  I don&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> The texture is not bad, smell good too, as just started to use, don&#x27;t know the effect yet. But I have confidence for this brand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but irratates my eyes, makes them red and kinda itchy</li>
    <li> Very effective . Does meet my wife&#x27;s expectations and will want to order again when needed. this is a very good product.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product! They eye cream makes a difference in about 1 weeks Puffiness is gone, wrinkles are less noticeable. The cream applies well and dries quickly. I would buy this product again and also reccomend it highly!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lightweight, concentrated moisturizer. Make up goes on well and keeps everything hydrated. Enjoyed using it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product while walking by a high-end retailer at The Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.  The gentleman who &amp;#34;pulled me in&amp;#34; was telling me that I had to try this because it was a miracle product.  I&#x27;m a very hard sell, so I left without purchasing but did like the way it felt around my eyes.  He applied it over makeup and I wasn&#x27;t convinced that it really did anything.  I left with a few samples and did my research on the product when I got home.  The prices at the Hotel for the product was in the hundreds of dollars and I would never have considered spending that much money, however, when I saw it on amazon for a more than fair price, I figured I had nothing to lose.  It is nice on the skin, soothing and smoothing on the sensitive eye area.  I don&#x27;t think it has miracle properties, but I do think it is better than other OTC brands and worth the amazon price for sure.  I would purchase it again!</li>
    <li> The product is ok, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in 2 weeks. My problem is that the pump on the bottle stopped working after about 5 days so I took the top off and could see all the way down to the bottom of the bottle.  It was basically empty after only using it twice a day for 5 days!! There was product stuck to the sides of the bottle so from the outside it looked like it was full, but there is nothing in the middle!!  What a waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Great eye cream. Targets the fine lines around the delicate eye area. Since using this cream my skin around the eye area has been smoother to the touch and to look at.</li>
    <li> Noticed no difference, there are better products for the money, shop around and find a better product to spend money on.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. She will be asking for more when used up. You know how women are always wanting to look twenty.</li>
    <li> My Wife likes it, says she can use it around her eyes without swelling and she likes to use it on her face as well.</li>
    <li> Did not try this.  Did not order this one.  Would like to try this eye treatment product.  Thank you!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> When I received this, it was barely half full!  Not happy!</li>
    <li> Bottle must have been near empty when received. Did not have the opportunity to use it after two weeks when it obviously was empty.  Used what was STUCK to the sides but that didn&#x27;t last long.  I will purchase from a more reputable site next time.</li>
    <li> I used this eye cream twice a day for 2 months. I did not notice any great diminishing of dark circles but as a moisturizing eye cream it was effective. Given the option between this product and the Vivo per Lei Anti-aging eye serum,  I will continue to use the serum and a good moisturizer to achieve same results.</li>
    <li> Found the cream made the under eye area puffy</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS SENT QUICKLY - I USE IT DAILY BUT DON&#x27;T THINK IT&#x27;S AS GOOD AS OTHER EYE CREAMS - I WOULD TRY THEIR EYE SERUM BUT NOT THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product.  I&#x27;ve used Olay. intermingled with higher end products, for years and  wanted to give this a try.  The scent and texture are amazing and at first I was thrilled.  However after about 3-4 weeks, I could tell the appearance of my skin was deteriorating.  It just didn&#x27;t seem to have a healthy look anymore.  I just went back to Regenerist this week.  this is definately not worth what I paid here on Amazon, much less what it&#x27;s sold for at the kiosks!!</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy with this product.  It did not come in a jar like in the picture.  It came in a bottle to&lt;br /&gt;Pump it and it&#x27;s already stopped up after less than a month. I can&#x27;t get any of the lotion out</li>
    <li> Bought this for my coworker a while back. As far as I know, she&#x27;s happy with the results. And if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy. So thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it for hydrating around the eyes. I would recommend it to everyone. It goes on and is not sticky.</li>
    <li> This eye treatment is great.  I put it on twice per day.  I even mix it a bit with my concealer and my eyes looks less dry with the makeup on as well.</li>
    <li> Seems to annoy my skin.  First time ever for an eye cream.  Surely not up to standards of good Dead Sea products.  I do.not recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought two of the vivo products from a mall store and decided to try a few from Amazon since they are less expensive.  Well, skin is pretty resilient and I have never had an issue with beauty products.  My entire face including my under eye area broke out in a rash.  I am still struggling to get rid of the rash around my eyes.  I threw out every single Vivo product I owned.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS IN A TIMELY MANNER BUT YOU THINK YOU ARE GETTING IT IN A JAR AND IT CAME IN A PUMP THAT DID NOT WORK...I THINK ITS TOO THICK TO PASS THROUGH...AND YOU GET A VERY SMALL AMOUNT...SINCE ITS A PUMP ITS GOING TO BE HARD TO USE THE LAST OF IT....AS FOR HELPING AROUND THE EYES... I DO NOT SEE MUCH IMPROVEMENT BUT IT IS NONE IRRITATING....I AM USING THE DAY LOTION AND REALLY LIKE THAT.... IM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE....</li>
    <li> This product has not disappointed me.  I need something for my eyes and it has done the trick for me.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It takes away bags under the eyes! I am 63 y.o. and I have not found a better product.  The shipper had it sent to me with the week of ordering.  It was a phenomenal purchase.</li>
    <li> Volume for this product better than the eye serum but still only half full. What is going on?!</li>
    <li> This is more like an eye gel.  I thought it was a cream.  Not crazy about it.  Would not order again.</li>
    <li> It is still too early to tell whether this product is better than others I have used, but I like it just the same.  I heard about the product from a friend who was visiting from Australia.  I was so surprised that I was able to purchase it through Amazon.  I like the fact that a little goes a long way, so it will last a while.</li>
    <li> At this point I can&#x27;t recommended, I have not being consistent using it</li>
    <li> I need to use this longer to have a better review for it - but it appears to work well. It refreshes my eye area.</li>
    <li> It arrived in the little bottle.The dispenser is missing. have been using it for a month now and haven&#x27;t noticed any &amp;#34;intensive treatment&amp;#34;  around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Didnt see any difference. Just a regular moisturizer. Not sure if it&#x27;s legit or just expired. Get the same results with any cheap eye cream. Which will be none</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had used this product and liked it.  It is a very good product and the service was excellent.</li>
    <li> I priced these items over the counter @ holiday time, and it was  way too exslensive. After reserch w/ Amazon.com I was so shocked to see the diference in cost, so I ordered through them and I saved 90%!!!!! This is a product all aging Ladies to know about! We can all use a face lift @ some point in life, but when you can avoid surgery and get the same results, well thats just unbelievable! But I tell you it works!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of puffiness under my eyes and was hoping this would work to reduce that.  It didn&#x27;t help the puffiness,  but maybe it isn&#x27;t the product that I need for that problem.  It didn&#x27;t really say it would reduce puffiness, but because of the name, I thought maybe it would.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product and the price!</li>
    <li> There is nothing in the bottle.</li>
