### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been going through shampoo and non-shampoo methods for years, trying to find the best combination for my hair.</li>
      <li>I was so impressed with the shampoo (received through Amazon Vine Program) that I went out and bought the conditioner.</li>
      <li>This was the best of the four I received.  </li>
      <li>and it goes perfectly with the shampoo!</li>
      <li>conditioner smells wonderful.  </li>
      <li>While my MIL was visiting this awesome conditioner came in the mail for me to try out.</li>
      <li>I am very impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>This product is very good.</li>
      <li>may not be in the best position to assess this conditioner vs. another, but I can say I got some great results with it.  </li>
      <li>The moisturizing and detangling ability is fair at best, though.</li>
      <li>The product smells wonderful and is effective in moisturizing both scalp and tips.</li>
      <li>They are great values though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It keeps my scalp in great condition and my hair tangle-free.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They have a great product here.  </li>
      <li>It does have a very nice smell to it.</li>
      <li>If it smells good, I&#x27;m happier.</li>
      <li>But if you want a good scalp nourisher, you might want to explore another route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And leaves my har in good shape as well.</li>
      <li>I coupled this with the matching shampoo and loved the results.  </li>
      <li>It is equally as good as the shampoo.</li>
      <li>loved the scent and design of the bottle.</li>
      <li>This is a good conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and I also loved it.</li>
      <li>Good conditioning product.</li>
      <li>The smell is good, and it seems to do the job....</li>
      <li>and I think is a good value.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is not anything amazing about this conditioner, but it is a good product that I would use again.</li>
      <li>Love It!</li>
      <li>amazing</li>
      <li>This conditioner does a great job and leaves my hair silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>This is a really nice conditioner.  </li>
      <li>What I love the most is how it makes my hair smell, and the compliments I have received on how great my hair smells.  </li>
      <li>I love it, feels really good</li>
      <li>Not to mention it leaves a nice fragranc to your hair.</li>
      <li>It lived up to its promises, but I just wasn&#x27;t thrilled over it.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and it seems to work well.</li>
      <li>I liked the way this conditioner made my hair feel</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s not a bad product, i.e., it has a pleasant smell and hair feels good after use.</li>
      <li>It smells really good and rinses easily.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to see better performance in those areas.</li>
      <li>if it does the job, I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
      <li>Works well, smells nice, but not too strong.</li>
      <li>So I loved how the conditioner eliminated all my fly aways and made my hair more attractive overall... plus conditioned my scalp so it did not get as greasy right away.</li>
      <li>It did smell nice and was fine for my hair but didn&#x27;t seem to change my scalp at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, while I still have a personal preference for conditioning shampoos, this is a very nice combination, with a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>and I still get complimented on how healthy my hair is, so...</li>
      <li>I love how my hair feels after this.</li>
      <li>I can maintain a healthy head of hair without spending a ton of money.</li>
      <li>I have used most of the bottle up and still have a problem with itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>I intend to continue using this product until I find something I like even more.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this conditioner</li>
      <li>I was awed once more.  </li>
      <li>really enjoyed this conditioner.</li>
      <li>But the one thing I was wishing for is that it would be a deeper conditioning for my ends, which still seemed like they needed more.  </li>
      <li>Over the years I have used a variety of products - from drugstore brands to high-end salon brands - and I think this is equivalent to even the most pricy products.  </li>
      <li>I purchased more of the Anti-danruff and it worked</li>
      <li>I love the shape of the bottle which makes it easier to store if you need the space.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m always on the look out for something affordable that works magic on my hair.</li>
      <li>I tried many things.  </li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Usually with a moisturizing conditioner, I see better results.</li>
      <li>If I hadn&#x27;t had a conditioner, I sure would have needed one.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, light brown hair.  </li>
      <li>I simply dry my hair and it looks great!</li>
      <li>This conditioner smells great and my hair feels extremely soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>Most importantly for me, it did not leave a scent in my hair, and the smell during use was</li>
      <li>However, as far as great bargains go, this is a winner.  </li>
      <li>So while it might have made my hair feel good immediately after the wash and condition, it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price is right, nice and inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It also feels like tangles are easy to comb out on longer</li>
      <li>it does not have a strong medicinal smell</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty nice as well.</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and it is fine, so no surprises here.  </li>
      <li>It seemed to work fine.</li>
      <li>This product smelled good to me which was a good start considering I was hesitant to even try this product after my previous experiences.  </li>
      <li>Now my hair is perfectly smooth, light and moisturized.</li>
      <li>The product is not \\&quot;store brand\\&quot; cheap in price, but nor is it \\&quot;salon</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic conditioner.</li>
      <li>This conditioner just doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair, which is supposed to be one of the primary purposes of a conditioner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly inexpensive, especially considering it yields top quality</li>
      <li>but I do appreciate how a good one can make my hair soft and shiny w/o looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s magic right away again.  </li>
      <li>Her hair was a thinner lightly permed white (she&#x27;s in her 70&#x27;s) and she loved the way it made her hair silky smooth without weighing it</li>
      <li>This conditioner made it much softer and added a healthy shine.</li>
      <li>That doesn&#x27;t detract from it completely though, it&#x27;s still a nice conditioner.</li>
      <li>It does appear to add some nice soft shine to your hair without making it look greasy or coated.  </li>
      <li>In the interests of full disclosure, I received this item through Amazon Vine.</li>
      <li>for I think this is only fair for those who read and rely on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now, I do not have full blown dandruff or severe dryness either...</li>
      <li>The Clear Scalp moisturizing dry scalp conditioner is wonderful.</li>
      <li>your scalp is dry to the point that you might want to seek a more effective solution.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I doubt there is a product that will help with genetic dry skin.</li>
      <li>I deal with dry scalp from time to time and have been impressed by the fancy deep treatment conditioners out there.</li>
      <li>This is a nice conditioner, it rinses clean, has a pleasant scent that is not overwhelming and leaves hair soft and detangled.</li>
      <li>and I have noticed that my hair has become very dry and almost brittle the more and more</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m just easy to please, but this new line of shampoo &amp; conditioners has me hooked!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t attest to the scalp nourishing factor, besides the fact that I rarely have dandruff, and didn&#x27;t get it while using this product.</li>
      <li>And to be honest I have like this shampoo and conditioner set enough to continue purchasing it after my trial bottle ran out.  </li>
      <li>My acne cleared right up</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product before and it is fine, so no surprises here.  I would like to know if there is a stronger product&lt;br /&gt;though.  I have itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo and conditioner i have found that works on my dry scalp</li>
    <li> I found this conditioner to be really thick (much like their shampoos) so I felt like I could get away with using less. It seemed to work fine. I put some on my palm, rubbed it in while in the shower and waited a few minutes. It rinsed clean and fairly easily, no left over residue, and left my hair smelling very fresh. I didn&#x27;t see much difference in the way my hair acted in humid weather and such, because my hair has a mind of its own and can only be tamed by Treseme Mousse. Other hair products are child&#x27;s play for my locks, which just laugh at my feeble attempts to break their spirit. And since my mane is very curly and thick, your millage may vary.</li>
    <li> Since moving to my new apt with very hard water my scalp has been dry and sometimes gets flaky.  I tried this shampoo and if anything my scalp got a little worse.  It did smell nice and was fine for my hair but didn&#x27;t seem to change my scalp at all.</li>
    <li> I have used most of the bottle up and still have a problem with itchy scalp. To be fair, I doubt there is a product that will help with genetic dry skin. But this doesn&#x27;t stop them from advertising that it will. Otherwise, it&#x27;s not a bad product, i.e., it has a pleasant smell and hair feels good after use.</li>
    <li> It has a light scent, it washes out well, and leaves my hair feeling soft.  I didn&#x27;t notice if it made a difference on my scalp, but it didn&#x27;t dry it out either.  The consistency is creamy, not oily, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh my hair down.  This stuff seems to hurt more if it gets near my eyes, then other conditioners do.  I like it, but I won&#x27;t order it again.  It lived up to its promises, but I just wasn&#x27;t thrilled over it.  I will stick to my regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I recieved some sample packets of this product and the matching shampoo in the mail.  I was extremely impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair gets baked and beaten almost on a daily basis since I swim outside every day in the tropical sun.  Often I swim in the ocean.  What a tangled mess it can become.  There are times when no brush or comb will begin to go through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this conditioner as I showered outdoors after coming out of the pool.  My hair immediately smoothed, softened and turned to silk, and a comb could glide through it no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair dried it was full, and shine with tons of body.  I was amazed.  They have a great product here.  I plan to get a bottle of this to take to the pool and beach with me, and coat my dry hair with it before I enter the water, to protect it from damage, as my stylist recommended.  This is a fantastic conditioner.</li>
    <li> My main problem with this line of products is how thick both shampoos and conditioners are, to the extent that it&#x27;s hard to squeeze them out of the bottle. As for other qualities, it&#x27;s just ok for my hair. This conditioner just doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair, which is supposed to be one of the primary purposes of a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out the whole line of Clear Scalp &amp; Hair conditioners.  This moisturizing dry scalp nourishing formula is very rich and thick.  It&#x27;s mildly scented, much more pleasant than other Clear Scalp &amp; Hair products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It keeps my scalp in great condition and my hair tangle-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with Clear Scalp &amp; Hair products.  I have yet to try one that disappoints.  If I were to judge by scent, I&#x27;d pick this conditioner.  If I were judging by results (i.e., unsolicited compliments), I&#x27;d pick [[ASIN:B007RTR8UW CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner]].</li>
    <li> This shampoo is so gentle, yet cleans my hair of all products used since the last shampoo without stripping essential oils and minerals. I was so impressed with the shampoo (received through Amazon Vine Program) that I went out and bought the conditioner. It is equally as good as the shampoo. On a scale of 1-10, I give this shampoo a 12!</li>
    <li> This gets the job done, when it comes to dandruff/dry scalp I have always kept a Head &amp; Shoulders on standby. This works just as well so far however my scalp issues are mild so not sure how it hold up against reallly bad scalp problems. I also use a different conditioner-in addition to this one in the end for improved scent and feel, as well as other benefits it does not have a strong medicinal smell it&#x27;s just not a scent I preferr. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I liked the way this conditioner made my hair feel but I&#x27;m not sure if it did much for my scalp. At the price of the conditioner, it&#x27;s certainly a value for what you&#x27;re getting. But if you want a good scalp nourisher, you might want to explore another route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this conditioner around the same time as two other Clear Scalp &amp; Hair products. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not an expert, but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between the three. They are great values though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your scalp is dry to the point that you might want to seek a more effective solution. I doubt this product will cure your problems. That doesn&#x27;t detract from it completely though, it&#x27;s still a nice conditioner.</li>
    <li> In the interests of full disclosure, I received this item through Amazon Vine. However, I try extremely hard to write my reviews as if I had paid the full purchase price, for I think this is only fair for those who read and rely on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed this conditioner. It made my long (and somewhat dry) hair really soft and manageable. Over the years I have used a variety of products - from drugstore brands to high-end salon brands - and I think this is equivalent to even the most pricy products.  It smells *amazing* and I plan on buying a bottle when mine runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a hair expert, but I do have medium length hair, and use conditioner a couple times a week.  This conditioner seemed to do the same thing as all the other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.  Nothing to help it stand out above the crowd, but also, nothing terrible about it.  I can&#x27;t attest to the scalp nourishing factor, besides the fact that I rarely have dandruff, and didn&#x27;t get it while using this product.</li>
    <li> The Clear Scalp moisturizing dry scalp conditioner is wonderful. I have a very dry scalp during the summer and the nourishing conditioner moisturized my scalp and made my dry scalp within days of starting to use it. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty dry scalp, and usually keep my hair buzzed short. I had decided to let it grow out, but stillit felt dry. This conditioner did make my scalp feel a little better, but I felt that it was very hard to rinse out (and my wife agrees). My hair is pretty thin, and if you have thick hair (like my wife) I think it is even harder to rinse out. The complaint my wife had was that she felt a film. I&#x27;m not much of a shampoo and conditioner expert....if it does the job, I&#x27;m pretty happy. If it smells good, I&#x27;m happier. The smell is good, and it seems to do the job....just with a filmy feeling. That doesn&#x27;t bother me, as I am thinking that is what is helping my scalp. It did bother my wife, and she does not use it anymore. I noticed also, on my daughters hair as well. It really takes a long time to rinse it out and not feel the filmyness. If you don&#x27;t mind that, then this is for you. I like it, and recommend you at least give it a try. You don&#x27;t need much, btw, so for the price, this will last you a long time and I think is a good value.</li>
    <li> I have gotten four different Clear products thanks to Vine.  Unfortunately they did nothing exceptional for me.  This was the best of the four I received.  While the shampoos left my scalp dry and itchy and with a dandruff problem that I hadn&#x27;t previously had, the conditioner reduced much of the itching.  This product smelled good to me which was a good start considering I was hesitant to even try this product after my previous experiences.  It was not as thick as some of the other conditioners and I seemed to need more to cover my hair.  While it reduced the itching, it did not seem to make a lasting impression in my hair as my hair did not feel any softer.</li>
    <li> One of the biggest banes of my existence is dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t matter the time of year, my skin is always dry and my scalp is no exception. Finding hair products that wont make the situation worse is a constant quest, bit I think this CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner might just be the ticket I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it not make the situation worse, it actually helped cut down on the scaling and flaking after just a few uses. I find my scalp to be much less dry and I don&#x27;t find myself scratching nearly as much these days. The product isn&#x27;t greasy of \\&quot;slick\\&quot; feeling. And leaves my har in good shape as well. I want to give it a few more months use before committing to a change, but so-far, I like what I see....and feel.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from lifeless, lank hair...so on the advice of a friend, I switched to this stuff. A TINY bit goes a LONG way, so it lasts forever....and it WORKS! My hair is much softer, healthier-feeling and most noticeably -- it feels alive again! I know I sound like a paid shill here, but I am obsessed with cheap-ass beauty products that actually work -- and this is one of my faves. Buy it NOW!!!</li>
    <li> Where i live is very dry and I need a conditioner to pervent my hair to break. This is the only one that help me and I feel I don&#x27;t lose my hair when i use this.</li>
    <li> Well, I bought this conditioner to go with the matching shampoo and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I usually wash my hair every day.  Yeah, I know that may be a lot, but if I am going out then washing my hair is a must to get it to do what I want it to do.  I have dry scalp so I thought this shampoo and conditioner would help and it is brand new too.  I like trying new things!  This conditioner does a great job and leaves my hair silky smooth.  No tangles and it is not greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like other conditioners that I have tried.  I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with the Clear Scalp Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might seem ridiculous to have some dandruff as well as oily hair. My hair gets oily in about 3 days. I try to not wash more than every 3, to not dry out my hair on the ends. This means I do get some dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the scent and design of the bottle. It was smooth and thick, which I like in conditioner. I need it because while I have thick hair, the individual hairs are very fine and when not using conditioner, I have awful tangles and flyaway hair. The shampoo alone did a nice job, but it left my hair a little lacking after rinsing. If I hadn&#x27;t had a conditioner, I sure would have needed one. I used it mainly on the ends, trying to avoid my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After air drying, my hair was shiny and silky. However in a day, I noticed more oil than normal on my scalp and hair near my roots. In 2 days, I found myself needing to wash my hair, when typically I can do another day. So while it might have made my hair feel good immediately after the wash and condition, it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now trying to use it without the shampoo to see if this makes any difference.</li>
    <li> If you use this conditioner, buy the shampoo to go along with it. This is a nice conditioner, it rinses clean, has a pleasant scent that is not overwhelming and leaves hair soft and detangled. It does nothing for frizz and it does not relieve itchy scalp by itself. Itchy scalp will go away after a few days if you use the CLEAR SCALP AND HAIR BEAUTY Shampoo with it.</li>
    <li> This is a good conditioner.  It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy, which some conditioners do, even after rinsing them out.  Most importantly for me, it did not leave a scent in my hair, and the smell during use was extremely mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice aspect of this product is the container.  It has a completely flat bottom, so it rests easily in a shower caddy or on the corner of the tub.  The conditioner is dispensed from the bottom of the container, which means you don&#x27;t have to shake it or leave it upside down to get some out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not anything amazing about this conditioner, but it is a good product that I would use again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always been hard for me to find shampoo/condition that works for me. I have medium length wavy hair and most shampoos either weigh my hair down and straighten it, or make my hair go frizzy. This is the first shampoo/condition that I&#x27;ve found that does neither and actually improves the look of my hair; it finally looks healthy! I don&#x27;t need to use any additional products once I&#x27;m out of the shower. I simply dry my hair and it looks great! The smell is pretty nice as well.</li>
    <li> I chose 5 stars because i haven&#x27;t found any other product that work this well for my dry scalp. I have very long thick oily hair and even after trying the most expensive shampoos and conditioners this one leaves my hair silky smooth and dry scalp free for up to 4 days. Sure beets washig every other day. Love It! To bad they discontinued it. I will pick it up no matter where I find it. This conditioner works very well with the same brand shampoo. Not to mention it leaves a nice fragranc to your hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves the hair silky and soft, great smelling, helps with the tangles AND conditions your scalp, doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weigh it down.  I LOVE this conditioner and it goes perfectly with the shampoo!</li>
    <li> I used this product with its companion [[ASIN:B007RTR8A2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] and enjoyed them, although I normally prefer a single shampoo that does both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the scent of the conditioner to have a bit more of a \\&quot;spice\\&quot; overtone than the matching shampoo, but my hair smelled nice following, and did not have a heavy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the shampoo and conditioner are very thick, and with my shorter hair, I only used a small amount of each.  The conditioner was appropriate and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or oily, in fact my hair passed my personal \\&quot;squeak test\\&quot; afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I still have a personal preference for conditioning shampoos, this is a very nice combination, with a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Works well, smells nice, but not too strong. Good conditioning product.</li>
    <li> I deal with dry scalp from time to time and have been impressed by the fancy deep treatment conditioners out there. However, as far as great bargains go, this is a winner.  The product smells wonderful and is effective in moisturizing both scalp and tips. The price is right, nice and inexpensive.  I love how my hair feels after this.</li>
    <li> I have hip length, very straight, very fine, medium thick hair. It&#x27;s normal, but damages easily, especially near the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this with the matching shampoo works very well on my hair. My hair is sleek, soft and shiny. I&#x27;ve noticed using this line that there is actually less breakage and splits in my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been going through shampoo and non-shampoo methods for years, trying to find the best combination for my hair. This is the best choice so far for commercial shampoos, doing even better than the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be too conditioning for people who want body and fullness, leaving their hair limp.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have issues with a dry scalp, but did use this conditioner. It was a little too heavy for me to use all the time. I did have my two swimmers use the conditioner and it worked for them. Their scalps can get dry from so much swimming and showering. This is definitely a conditioner that I would suggest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus in my hair for quite some time now so I may be biased. This does the same thing as almost any conditioner that I&#x27;ve tried. Although it did not leave any greasy residue and did not dry out my hair, it did not leave me thinking that it was such a great product that I wanted to buy and use it again. It does have a very nice smell to it. Not overpowering at all. If you want something cheap that conditions then I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is very thick and rich. It smells really good and rinses easily. The moisturizing and detangling ability is fair at best, though. I would have liked to see better performance in those areas. I don&#x27;t think it should be called a \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; conditioner - at least not in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually with a moisturizing conditioner, I see better results. I had to use ALOT of this conditioner at a time, and use a leave-in conditioner afterwards. With my normal shampoo &amp; conditioner, I only use the leave-in once or twice a week at most, but with this I had to use the leave-in everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this along with the matching shampoo and saw no improvement with dry scalp issues. Now, I do not have full blown dandruff or severe dryness either... just a little dryness and itch at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, to my waist and very wavy/curly. It is a little dry, but not severely and not damaged. This pair may work better for someone with a different hair texture and quality, perhaps, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with hair like mine, based on my experience with it.</li>
    <li> I like the Clear Scalp because it actually manages to give a bit of the old feel back, without making my hair feel greasy as if I&#x27;ve left conditioner in it. I&#x27;ve used this for about a week now, and really like how it makes my hair look and feel. Definately worth a try if your trying to avoid that brillo pad head of grey hair like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to worry about greasy, oily hair back in the day. I searched out shampoos that would dry out the scalp and leave my hair less oily. Well a handful of years ago I started to go grey, and when I went grey, I skipped right over the \\&quot;salt &amp; pepper\\&quot; look and jumped from a dark brown to Bob Barker in what seemed almost overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I didn&#x27;t mind losing my hair color at a young age...at least I still had a full head of hair which is more than I can say for several friends, but what I hated was that the grey hair was of such a different texture and feel from my regular hair. It was coarse, dry and wiry. Suddenly shampoos like Head and Shoulders and Pert we too harsh, and my scalp felt brittle.</li>
    <li> I love this new line of hair care products from Clear Scalp. The Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner goes perfect with the Clear Scalp Shampoo that I am currently using. This conditioner smells great and my hair feels extremely soft and healthy. I love the shape of the bottle which makes it easier to store if you need the space. I know that this is nourishing my scalp but you surely will see the difference in your hair within a week because my hair already feels quite voluminous in just this short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Clear Scalp &amp;Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm to help provide my scalp with moisture as well as nourishment. I am in love with this conditioner and will definitely continue to use this in my hair. I like that I can maintain a healthy head of hair without spending a ton of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m someone who normally uses the cheapest shampoo and conditioner I can get because my mindset was any worked just as well. I may be changing my tune after using this. After only a few days using this nourishing shampoo and conditioner together I found that I was running my fingers through my hair. That&#x27;s not a normal thing for me to do because I swim a lot and usually my hair feels like straw. Not so using this combination! The conditioner is thick and rinses out pretty well; although my hair still feels a little slippery after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still find myself running my fingers through my hair; definitely a winner for me! :-) I would suggest trying the shampoo and conditioner together. I definitely recommend this highly if you want soft silky hair like mine now feels! :-)</li>
    <li> This product is very good. It has a nice smell and it seems to work well. I like the consistency too...somewhere between normal consistency and glue (and I mean that in a good way). It&#x27;s not as runny as most shampoo/conditioner, and it feels like it&#x27;s actually got some substance to it. Recommended.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW! I am very impressed with this product. I&#x27;ve tried a few rinse-out conditioners over the years (not many). I stay away from them because I never felt a benefit after the rinse. Every few years I decide to go out on a limb and try something new. This product did not disappoint. I am African American and my hair is normally dry which is why I prefer leave-in conditioners. However, this product leaves my hair soft and manageable. It is THE ONLY rinse formula that has not left my hair feeling totally dry. I wash my hair daily due to working out at the gym. I use this product about twice per week (sometimes three times per week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars (vs five) because I don&#x27;t have experience with many other products of this type. For my limited experience this is a five star product.</li>
    <li> This winter has been especially dry, and every part of my skin has suffered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of conditioner, but I do appreciate how a good one can make my hair soft and shiny w/o looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may not be in the best position to assess this conditioner vs. another, but I can say I got some great results with it.  I have very fine, light brown hair.  This conditioner made it much softer and added a healthy shine.</li>
    <li> About a year and a half ago, I started getting acne on my scalp and some dandruff-looked like specks of dust by the end of the day.  I tried many things.  I was super embarrassed about my condition, because it is not exactly &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;. I decided to try this clear stuff-because all of the other embarrassing (to me) products had not been effective.  I was amazed at the results! My acne cleared right up and I do not have the dandruff specks.  My hair is also shiny and manageable.  After finishing my original bottles, because my scalp and hair were back to normal, I tried Clear&#x27;s Total Care.  My hair immediately became unmanageable again. I didn&#x27;t really put the two together.  Because of the frizz I tried Clear&#x27;s Anti-Frizz and it made my hair feel funny and was still unmanageable.  So I went back to the Total Care when I notice some Acne on my scalp.  I purchased more of the Anti-danruff and it worked it&#x27;s magic right away again.  I was awed once more.  I am hooked on this stuff and marvel that it is such a low cost for an amazing effect. If you have acne on the scalp and dandruff, I recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love it, feels really good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty line for awhile now, specifically the Shea Ultra Nourishing shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I love it. I recieved this conditioner last week and I&#x27;m equally impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really long, naturally pin straight, relatively thick hair.  It has never been dyed or treated in any way.  I shampoo &amp; condition daily despite being told \\&quot;its not good\\&quot; well, I&#x27;ve done it all my life and I still get complimented on how healthy my hair is, so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner smells wonderful.  Floral and fresh were my initial thoughts. It felt thick, easily coated my hair with just a dime sized amount and rinsed out cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards my hair felt soft, nourished and smelled fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m just easy to please, but this new line of shampoo &amp; conditioners has me hooked!</li>
    <li> I keep my hair very short, and this conditioner was so light that, if anything, it made my hair a bit too fluffy. A very smooth, soft, nice-to-run-my-fingers-through sort of fluffy, but still fluffier than i&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this with the matching shampoo, i did experience a reduction in dry scalp symptoms, so it seems to deliver on the &#x27;dry scalp nourishing&#x27; promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two problems with this conditioner are both pretty trivial.&lt;br /&gt;1) The conditioner comes in smaller bottles than the shampoo. No woman i&#x27;ve ever known goes through conditioner more slowly than shampoo, so having the conditioner come in a smaller bottle is a little strange.&lt;br /&gt;2) The smell. It&#x27;s generic perfume-y, and awfully sweet. But it doesn&#x27;t last after my hair dries, so it only troubles me in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice conditioner.  It does appear to add some nice soft shine to your hair without making it look greasy or coated.  I always find with a conditioner that they either produce buildup, which weights down or can actually \\&quot;flatten\\&quot; the appearance of your hair, or they tend to be very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner does neither.  It rinses out easily, so your hair doesn&#x27;t feel coated, and it leaves your hair looking \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; with a soft sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also feels like tangles are easy to comb out on longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how it feels on your scalp, I do notice my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel dry or itchy, something that I do sometimes feel in weather extremes, like the summer heat and sun, lot so swimming in chlorinated pools, the ocean, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are typical of a conditioner.  The product is not \\&quot;store brand\\&quot; cheap in price, but nor is it \\&quot;salon expensive.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s fairly inexpensive, especially considering it yields top quality results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the price and results I would give this product a try!</li>
    <li> I coupled this with the matching shampoo and loved the results.  I don&#x27;t have the money for the high priced salon hair care products so I&#x27;m always on the look out for something affordable that works magic on my hair. I have to admit that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these products but I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only do I love how this feels while using it, it leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.  What I love the most is how it makes my hair smell, and the compliments I have received on how great my hair smells.  Who can deny that compliments are nice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this available at my local grocery store for about the same price as a comparable size pantene or herbal essences. And to be honest I have like this shampoo and conditioner set enough to continue purchasing it after my trial bottle ran out.  I intend to continue using this product until I find something I like even more.</li>
    <li> While my MIL was visiting this awesome conditioner came in the mail for me to try out. She snatched it up before I even had a chance to try it.  She just ranted and raved about it and it ended up on the flight back with her!  Her hair was a thinner lightly permed white (she&#x27;s in her 70&#x27;s) and she loved the way it made her hair silky smooth without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it as well and I also loved it. I have waist long medium/thick blonde hair that is straight and gets greasy really quick, but also has a tendency to be dry initially both on ends and scalp (and fly-aways are popular in my head of hair!).  So I loved how the conditioner eliminated all my fly aways and made my hair more attractive overall... plus conditioned my scalp so it did not get as greasy right away. I would give it a glowing 5 stars for that.  But the one thing I was wishing for is that it would be a deeper conditioning for my ends, which still seemed like they needed more.  So I ended up blending it with my other favorite conditioner: Pantene Long Lengths Replenishing Hair Mask.  I use the mask on the ends and halfway up, and I use this clear scalp conditioner all over.  Now my hair is perfectly smooth, light and moisturized. PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tried a couple different CLEAR SCALP types of conditioners and they just didn&#x27;t work the same way as this one... so I would highly recommend trying this one if you are going to try any of them to control for dry or fly-away hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for about 2 years (whenever my scalps gets itchy).  I have been using it more often recently and I have noticed that my hair has become very dry and almost brittle the more and more I use it.  I have been using this product everyday (sometimes every other day) for the past 3 weeks and I am going to pitch it and try to find a different shampoo.</li>
