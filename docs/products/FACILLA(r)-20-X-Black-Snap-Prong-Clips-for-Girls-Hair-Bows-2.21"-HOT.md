      <li>They hold my hair in place very nicely.  </li>
      <li>Slide out of your hair very easily.</li>
      <li>my daughters have very fine hair, so kids clips would always slip off and girls would look unkempt.</li>
      <li>These are so cheap they are rusted!</li>
      <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>These clips are large, hold all day, good grip, dont rust and the paint doesnt come off</li>
      <li>These hair clips work fine.</li>
      <li>In as much as they are made in China, they don&#x27;t seem authentic or appropriate to be used for a Kippah.</li>
      <li>There is nothing special to these clips.  </li>
      <li>The size is what I was expected, so my happy with it.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very sturdy &amp; rough but do a great job</li>
      <li>They are easy to snap open and close.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
      <li>It came with free bobby pins, but they are also abnormally long for some reason.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t grip your hair strongly like other hair clips like these.</li>
      <li>The item pictured is not what they send you, the real clips have some sort of tiny logo sticker attached to them that if you don&#x27;t remove first will rub off and get stuck in your hair, plus every 4 clips has a bunch of bobby pins with it for some reason.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You really get what you pay for, these are just plain cheap.</li>
      <li>I was trying them on the very first time they arrived &amp; a few of them broke immediately!</li>

    <li> Too big I dindnt like this clips,now I have a bunch of then without knowing how they will be used.</li>
    <li> They are perfect.  They hold my hair in place very nicely.  They are easy to snap open and close.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Picture shows hole in end. No hole. Needed whole for project we are doing :-(</li>
    <li> These are very thin and flimsy. They don&#x27;t grip your hair strongly like other hair clips like these. Slide out of your hair very easily. I would not buy these again.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with this product. The size is what I was expected, so my happy with it.</li>
    <li> These are so cheap they are rusted! Worse part the rust blew up in the air and I breathed it in who knows the chemicals that are in the paint. Save your money on these</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re clips - they do what they&#x27;re supposed to. Took forever to come though</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re made in China. These hair clips work fine. The only reason i gave them a 3-star rating is because i was looking for a product from ISRAEL not CHINA as I intend to use these clips for a kippah. In as much as they are made in China, they don&#x27;t seem authentic or appropriate to be used for a Kippah. The fact that they are sold under the description &amp;#34;Black Snap Prong Clips for Girls&amp;#34; does not help any.</li>
    <li> very basic clips but hold well</li>
    <li> These do not hold hair that well.</li>
    <li> They did not look like the picture at all. Have gold writing on them and are extra long. Also not very strong. It came with free bobby pins, but they are also abnormally long for some reason. These may be intended for very thick, course hair</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> There is nothing special to these clips.  I have fly away hairs that I like to keep out of my face when wearing my hair up.  These do the trick without falling out.</li>
    <li> They are bigger than the average clip and are flimsy.  They don&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
    <li> Great size for me. I have crazy baby hair since I had my daughter, and these pins help me manage my hair</li>
