<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great but leave stained on my light color clothes.</li>
    <li> I loved the scent I gave it as a gift and it smelled great on both of us. Although it smells different on each person I held a light sweet fragrance. I look forward to receiving one myself as a gift!</li>
    <li> One of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made...&lt;br /&gt;no regrets.</li>
    <li> Amazing love love love this parfume...I get asked at least 2 to three times daily what im wearing.</li>
    <li> The perfume was rancid. I was so disappointed it smelled terrible.</li>
    <li> Weak and does not last.  Worth every extra penny paying full retail in department store.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time...Smells great! Will definitely order again. I am constantly getting complimented on it. The price is better than at Sephora</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Scent lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Bought this fragrance for my mom as a gift. she loved it...it smells great! She got the euphoria blossom one as well because she fell in love with the euphoria collection! Calvin Klein fragrances are the best!</li>
    <li> wonderfully fresh, fruity, and elegant smell. it does seem to wear off after a full day but they all do.</li>
    <li> This product smells awesome. The scent last well into the day.  Great buy! Full sized bottle, shipped quickly. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> The scent is decaying quickly but it is ok in general, for this price you can go for it as an every day EDT, but if you are looking for a real EDP so this is not what u look for</li>
    <li> My sister in law bought his at Macy&#x27;s and I smelled it and feel in love.  I just cant seeing paying as much as she did though.  I found it here and it was a great deal.  I am considering buying a couple more to have on hand for gifts.</li>
    <li> Love at first smell!  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the first to review this on Amazon. I&#x27;ve passed over this fragrance and not even given it a chance many times.  I&#x27;m a 30 something woman and my husband (40&#x27;s) sniffed this one out at Ulta and sprayed some on paper for me. Instantly, we both thought this smelled so good! Fruity and floral. I thought I smelled a hint of vanilla but it&#x27;s not on the list. It smells youthful and will be good for a variety of ages without smelling teenagery. I really like it and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll tire of it quickly. Kinda pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it to finally find a fragrance that doesn&#x27;t turn my stomach with too sweet or too heavy notes. Perfectly balanced fragrance that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache. I didn&#x27;t really like Euphoria because it was too floral for my tastes, but FE is just right.   From the CK website: Sensual. alluring. modern. a younger interpretation of the iconic euphoria fragrance, forbidden euphoria evokes a modern, fresh sexiness with a mysterious twist. forbidden euphoria is a seductive blend of exotic fruits, addictive floralcy and sophisticated musks.  top notes: sparkling mandarin, passion fruit and touches of iced raspberry  mid notes: a hypnotic bouquet of tiger orchid and jasmine  base notes: addictive patchouli with sophisticated musks and cashmere woods</li>
    <li> Beautiful sophisticated fragrance.  I give this as a gift often.  I always make sure I have a spare on hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking that I was getting the &amp;#34;Forbidden&amp;#34; version of this perfume, but instead got the regular &amp;#34;Euphoria&amp;#34;. It smells really good, don&#x27;t get me wrong, and the perfume came in very good conditions for being shipped overseas. But I had to give it a 3-star because the seller advertised &amp;#34;Forbidden&amp;#34; which is the newer version of the &amp;#34;Euphoria&amp;#34; series from Calvin Klein and it was not at all what I got.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t small like the one I bought from the store</li>
    <li> I actually ordered it for a friend as a present, not realizing that it came with lotion and body wash because...I guess I don&#x27;t pay attention to product descriptions. And the box was surprisingly nice, I think my friend actually kept it. So yeah, pretty solid buy on the whole. It smells great--probably geared more for girls in the twenty something age range. Or thirty maybe idk, I just wouldn&#x27;t buy it for someone&#x27;s grandmother. My friend really enjoys it and she&#x27;s pretty picky...just sayin&#x27;</li>
    <li> I have chosen it because I know it really well, which means it wasn&#x27;t my first experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I truly recommend this perfume for every girl and for a gift.</li>
    <li> my first favorite perfume that stays on long and has a sweet scent that l love to have it everyday use.</li>
    <li> romantic n appealing. got it for my fiance and never regretted it</li>
    <li> amazing smell nothing more can describe what wonderful is this perfume ... really it&#x27;s the best smell i wish to smell for ever amazingggggggggg</li>
    <li> I am a Euphoria girl but hands down Forbidden Euphoria is now my favorite. It is very seductive and sensual. I wear it every day and get may compliments. Especially from my husband. If you like earthy scents this is the one for you. It truly fits my mystic and lifestyle as a Reiki Master.</li>
    <li> fast and the price was awesome!!!  I have used Euphoria for years and love this too!  One spring/summer; one fall and winter.</li>
    <li> . Smells sweet and spicy. I really enjoy the scent. I wish that the scent lasted longer. It fades quickly after a couple hours.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and smells awesome. The bottle is unique and very sexy.  The scent last all day. She just loves it.</li>
    <li> I did something completely not like me when I ordered this fragrance off of Amazon without ever having smelled it in my life, but I do like it.  I will tell you, I normally do not prefer anything remotely &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; - although this isn&#x27;t very much so, but after it settled down a bit, I really did like it.  It is not the typical &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; Calvin Klein scent I was accustomed to.  But, since it isn&#x27;t overly powerful in any way at all, it is a nice, easy scent to wear.  If you work in an office with a &amp;#34;fragrance-phobe&amp;#34; - you will be just fine with this cologne.</li>
    <li> OMGoodness, this is one of my favorite colognes &amp; the price was so reasonable for this large bottle.  Did have to wait about 2 weeks for it to arrive, but was in no hurry--for that price.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice container and smells very nice.  I previously smelled in store before ordering and was as I expected.</li>
    <li> This was a gift purchased for someone else and the person didn&#x27;t get what I ordered. She mentioned that it was a gift pack with lotion and body wash. I definitely ordered just the perfume. What happened there?</li>
    <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> My husband bought me the box with lotions from Macy&#x27;s  for the same price and this one smells very different. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a famyastic product. The ladies of the house really enjoy this item. The price and size are great. I will be getting more for other family members for next christma and birthday presents.</li>
    <li> From a guy....I love smelling this on my GF or any girl for that matter. I dont find it overpowering or anything.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell. We tried to buy it once in a trip and did not find it. Found now in Amazon. Have a good use of it.</li>
    <li> A gift for my wife.  She likes the smell.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a christmas gift, I have always worn Euphoria and was a little skeptical about switching to the forbidden but I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift. Got here fast and smells Amazing! I would buy again. Good size bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so si Happy. I had my doubts about this product considering the great price, but now I&#x27;m completely satisfied, i love this fragante And ir&#x27; s exactly the same to the once I had before!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and the smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than an hour or so. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same as the department store brand.</li>
    <li> item arrived just as described, it was a gift for my sister, excellent price, i saw this product on a store twice the price vs amazon, totally recommend this</li>
    <li> Excellent first quality product perfume and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> me salio costoso el envio pero llego bien</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazing... youthful, playful, SEXY. Guys cannot get enough of it! So much better than regular euphoria. The only thing I would change is to exchange some of its strong projection for some more longevity. But other than that... perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you&#x27;re looking for a \\&quot;daytime version\\&quot; of this scent, check out 212 Sexy!</li>
    <li> I smelled this perfume at ULTA and I had to have it. When I used the first day it gave me a terrible headache at work. The scent is not the same when I wear it. At ULTA it smelled better. Oh, I&#x27;m a woman using my husband&#x27;s accout.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It is sweeter than classic Euphoria, which is more flowery compared to this in my opinion. But this is a good version of it for people who like sweet flowery scents more.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this at Sephora &amp; was bounded &amp; determined to find it cheaper.came new in box &amp; all sealed..thank u arrived on time</li>
    <li> that I bought from \\&quot;shades and sprays\\&quot;.  Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t seen her since she got it and I don&#x27;t know what it smells like, but she loved it and that&#x27;s all that matters.  It also was shipped right away and that pleased me--thank you.</li>
    <li> I had a small sample tube of this that I loved and found a great deal on here for a big bottle so I got it. I still like the scent, but this sprays more than the little sample did so it makes it much stronger. This is definitely a scent I need to spray in the air and walk through, as opposed to spraying directly on, otherwise it&#x27;s just too strong. I used to have the original Euphoria and I have Euphoria blossom as well which is nice.</li>
    <li> This product smells great! I purchased this as a gift for my mom. It came with lotion as well. Works great as a gift or for yourself.</li>
    <li> Not my personal favorite smell.  A little too musky for me.  I bought it off of the reviews so it&#x27;s just a matter of personal taste.  I knew that I may not love it considering I had nothing to go off of.  Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> My wife really love it! She said the box is just perfect that she´ll keep to protect the bottle! I think that i bought an excelente chistmas present for her!</li>
    <li> wife loves it great value</li>
    <li> Great buy!!!! Very pleased.  Arrived promptly with a free gift of some fragrance lotion</li>
    <li> Great price, wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> The scent smells like it has been on the shelf too long.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and have been wearing it for a some years now.  Always get compliments on it when I wear it.</li>
    <li> My wife went head over hills on the style of this product and i fail in love with the smell.</li>
    <li> This a wonderful scent! I have had many compliments on it. I would recommend this scent! I have found my new scent!</li>
    <li> The only thing that could have made it better is faster shipping :) love the perfume and love the price I got it for!</li>
    <li> IT IS LOVELY-I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love Euphoria.  This perfume is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Great price. I love this perfume</li>
    <li> Order came quickly &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price!!! Amazon has the lowest prices when comparing other department store prices. I&#x27;ve always wanted to order this perfume &amp; with Amazon&#x27;s low prices I decided to take a chance. I&#x27;m so happy I did! It&#x27;s the real thing! I also ordered Herve Leger by Herve Leger. Did not disappoint! I have read other reviews saying the scent of different perfumes seemed to be watered down or weak. Both perfumes I&#x27;ve ordered are strong &amp; long lasting! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these purchases &amp; will order again-soon!!!</li>
    <li> Not too heavy...just right.  Oodles of compliments everywhere I go from women and men on this one.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and much cheaper than at Macy&#x27;s or other fragrance places. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I really love this scent. It stays all day and smells fantastic on my skin:) You can always count on Calvin Klein!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s most favorite - and a real bargain!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves the stuff</li>
    <li> This is one of my new favorite perfumes! It smells like exotic flowers and fruit! It is fancy but also playful at the same time and that is why i love it so much. I love this perfume it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Checked this fragrance out at the local ck outlet store and they wanted $80 for it. Nope - not gonna pay that for it - though it really smells nice and fresh. Actually prefer this one over the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; women&#x27;s Euphoria. We really love this fragrance. It&#x27;s wears nicely on my wife and she really likes it. We both tend to enjoy fresher, citrus based scents and this one had a nice sweetness to it without being over-bearing or so strong that it makes me taste the perfume. Goes on a bit strong, but lasts nicely and wears much softer. Smells great, even hours later.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product unless you are looking for a cheap replacement.&lt;br /&gt;This essence smells like alcohol for few minutes when first used and then turns out into an impossible smell.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return the item back and there is no option available for returning this so called hazardous item but they suggest you to dispose it accordingly to the state and local law.  I will dispose it accordingly but the problem is that I lost my money. The entire content of the shipping box smells like coming from China, there is no invoice included in the box, no option to contact the seller or to leave the seller a feedback. Very disappointed by Amazon selling trash while instructing me to dispose the purchase as a hazardous item and not being entitled to a refund.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this as a gift for my Sister, but found out that I could not mail it overseas, so I kept it for me. I tried it for the first time a few months ago and fell in love with the scent. It is not overwhelming and not too fruity or floral. It does not smell like your grandmother&#x27;s perfume. It&#x27;s clean, young and vibrant. My go to perfume for all occasions.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this and the price was much better than in store. Thanks for offering at such great prices</li>
    <li> Christmas present from the wife and I for my mother in law. She really likes the smell.</li>
