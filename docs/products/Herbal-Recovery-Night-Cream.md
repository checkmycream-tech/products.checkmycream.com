### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is wonderful!</li>
      <li>This has to be the best cream I have ever tried!</li>
      <li>bought it for my colleague, she said she like it, it is very good and will buy probably buy this product again.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product as being safer for pregnancy (recommended by the book Belli Beautiful).  </li>
      <li>Beautiful scent.</li>
      <li>smells great, but doesn&#x27;t do the work.</li>
      <li>great overnight cream</li>
      <li>Very nice cream.</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>you are looking for a light night moisturizer, this would be perfect.</li>
      <li>It is a good price.</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing and the cream feels so good on my face.  </li>
      <li>This is a perpetual irritation for me, face creams that tell you to stay away from the eye area (it&#x27;s those crow&#x27;s feet and undereye circles that need cream the most!).  </li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>My face feels nice and hydrated when I wake up, and I have noticed an improvement in my complexion.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful and leaves your skin soft and not sticky.</li>
      <li>omg I love.  </li>
      <li>Have used this for years and most of the Jurlique line.  </li>
      <li>though I like the cream, I had decided to try a more inexpensive brand.</li>
      <li>I love it and it is not greasy and encourage you to buy it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thinner and is more of an almost a whipped texture.</li>
      <li>good product, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I wish it had the wonderful fragrance that my other Jurlique products have.</li>
      <li>Night cream is a miracle worker on my wrinkles &amp; fine lines.  </li>
      <li>The texture of this Jurlique Herbal recovery night cream is light and silky.</li>
      <li>Never disappointed.</li>
      <li>It plays well over my nightly oil routine, and is really spreadable without becoming gummy.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this cream is amazing, clean and pretty.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, with a medium weight and absorbs fairly quickly without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>It is worth the money in my opinion, and it is cheaper on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this and it really helped keep my skin more clear if I put it on every night after I washed my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>She loves it very much.</li>
      <li>when I use this at night (if i dont use a diff night cream), my face is better the next morning.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face stick to the pillow, and it really does sink right into my skin.</li>
      <li>skin is super soft after using, not greasy or oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>I do not like it as much my as my Olay products.  </li>
      <li>But, be forewarned, it can be a little overwhelming at first.</li>
      <li>the way you apply it - warm a small amount of creme between your fingertips and then press on to face and neck -</li>
      <li>My skin is almost albino in color, combination-oily, sensitive, and pretty prone to break-outs.</li>
      <li>Not only does it not break out my sensitive skin, but it also made all my fine lines on my forehead practically vanish...</li>
      <li>So while I will continue to use this while pregnancy/nursing is an issue (or until the jar runs out, whichever comes later), and put a different cream around my eyes, as soon as it&#x27;s safe</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to use a tiny bit too so it lasts for a long time.  </li>
      <li>And most importantly it&#x27;s not supposed to be used around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>But when I woke up after having applied a normal cream to my face, I realized that I was too vein not to pay for this cream again &#x3D;</li>
      <li>Just bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>I used it when I was pregnant and all of my other moisturizers were breaking me out.</li>
      <li>I have noticed this product somehow helps keep the oily balance in check, while keeping my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I woke up smelling it a few times, which was nice, but just letting you know because unlike other creams this scent doesn&#x27;t just dissipate.</li>
      <li>This is worth a shot if you have exhausted your resources and want to try something new.</li>

    <li> This stuff is wonderful! The smell is a bit strange, but not a huge deterrent for me. My face feels nice and hydrated when I wake up, and I have noticed an improvement in my complexion. My skin is almost albino in color, combination-oily, sensitive, and pretty prone to break-outs. I have noticed this product somehow helps keep the oily balance in check, while keeping my skin soft and hydrated. This is worth a shot if you have exhausted your resources and want to try something new. It is worth the money in my opinion, and it is cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I wake up in the mornings with extremely dry skin after using this product at night.</li>
    <li> I actually found it drying</li>
    <li> Very nice cream. Goes on smooth, with a medium weight and absorbs fairly quickly without feeling greasy. I wish it had the wonderful fragrance that my other Jurlique products have.</li>
    <li> great overnight cream</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this through birchbox. I used it when I was pregnant and all of my other moisturizers were breaking me out. It is amazing. Not only does it not break out my sensitive skin, but it also made all my fine lines on my forehead practically vanish...I actually was getting botox to treat these before my pregnancy and I had to stop, so when this cream faded them away, I was shocked. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Second one. Beautiful scent. Moisturizing without leaving an oily residue.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and most of the Jurlique line.  Never disappointed.</li>
    <li> bought it for my colleague, she said she like it, it is very good and will buy probably buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this and it really helped keep my skin more clear if I put it on every night after I washed my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to use a tiny bit too so it lasts for a long time.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> This has to be the best cream I have ever tried! I love it and it is not greasy and encourage you to buy it. Smells wonderful and leaves your skin soft and not sticky.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as being safer for pregnancy (recommended by the book Belli Beautiful).  I do not like it as much my as my Olay products.  It leaves my skin feeling tight instead of soft.  And most importantly it&#x27;s not supposed to be used around the eyes.  This is a perpetual irritation for me, face creams that tell you to stay away from the eye area (it&#x27;s those crow&#x27;s feet and undereye circles that need cream the most!).  So while I will continue to use this while pregnancy/nursing is an issue (or until the jar runs out, whichever comes later), and put a different cream around my eyes, as soon as it&#x27;s safe I&#x27;m reverting back to Olay.  Too bad, because I really try to use safer products.</li>
    <li> When I apply it in the evening, I get a moisturized sensation that doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy. When I wake up and wash my face, it feels like I&#x27;ve been wearing a thin mask over my face, leaving my skin smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Given the way you apply it - warm a small amount of creme between your fingertips and then press on to face and neck - the creme lasted 4 months for me, which brings the prize down a little.  When applying it, you have a sensation that you are putting on way to little, but not much is needed with this cream. If you like to smother your face in cooling cream, then this is not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I like the cream, I had decided to try a more inexpensive brand. But when I woke up after having applied a normal cream to my face, I realized that I was too vein not to pay for this cream again &#x3D; Just bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Only draw back (apart from the price), is that it has a scent that my husband doesn&#x27;t like. The scent dies down quickly, so it&#x27;s not a big deal - just though I would mention it.</li>
    <li> you only need a little bit of this cream which is good because it&#x27;s small and expensive.  I like putting this on the nights where i&#x27;m broken our or extra red because it makes my skin feel super soft and tight.  some people don&#x27;t like the tight feeling but I like it becasue i feel like it&#x27;s making my pores shrink a little.  when I use this at night (if i dont use a diff night cream), my face is better the next morning.  I don&#x27;t like the scent at all but it goes away after about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> Night cream is a miracle worker on my wrinkles &amp; fine lines.  Have been using faithfully for a month, and have noticed a reduction of the appearance of wrinkles.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> omg I love.  The smell is amazing and the cream feels so good on my face.  It has lasted me a long time as I only use a little of it each night.</li>
    <li> Would never buy again. Made my skin inflame in a rash for about a week with a million little bumps. My friends warned me but didnt listen.</li>
    <li> The texture of this Jurlique Herbal recovery night cream is light and silky. It&#x27;s thinner and is more of an almost a whipped texture. It doesn&#x27;t make my face stick to the pillow, and it really does sink right into my skin. It plays well over my nightly oil routine, and is really spreadable without becoming gummy.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this cream is amazing, clean and pretty. But, be forewarned, it can be a little overwhelming at first. I woke up smelling it a few times, which was nice, but just letting you know because unlike other creams this scent doesn&#x27;t just dissipate. It does soften, but lingers.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is super soft after using, not greasy or oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a light night moisturizer, this would be perfect.</li>
    <li> It is a good price. Brought for my friend.who is the fans of Jurlique. She loves it very much. But it may not be use up soon as it is a small package.</li>
    <li> good product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> smells great, but doesn&#x27;t do the work. I used it for 2 weeks just to give a try, my skin has literally got drier. I don&#x27;t feel the hydration and did not recover anything. i do not recommend it.</li>
