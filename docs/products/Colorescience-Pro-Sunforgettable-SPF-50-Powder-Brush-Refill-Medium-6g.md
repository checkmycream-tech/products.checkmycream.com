      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>love love love--best spf powder out there.</li>

      <li>I keep this in my car for easy application wherever I go.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use</li>
      <li>so easy sunscreen powder.</li>
      <li>But once the dermatologist showed me how easy it was to use, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and reapply.  </li>
      <li>I swirl on the fine powder on the backs of my hands before driving, and on my exposed neck and chest.  </li>
      <li>This time they did not have a refill available</li>
      <li>Finding 50 SPF is usually not easy, but here is the perfect, non-greasy and portable solution.</li>
      <li>Great product, I also really like the fact that it contains sunscreen, which many similar products lack.</li>
      <li>Product originally recommend to me by dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>Also, this product is the refill, which is another great feature the other brush on SPF products lack.</li>
      <li>It does not clog my pores and the sunscreen protects my very fair and sensitive (Irish) complexion.</li>
      <li>Oh, if you want a little more cover use the sunforgettable face primer spy 30, you&#x27;ll love how it glides on!</li>
      <li>You should wash the bristles upon new refill, it&#x27;s easy too.</li>
      <li>Love the ease of being able to brush it on and it&#x27;s portable in the purse or beach bag without the greasy mess.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply and has such a high amount of Zinc in it that I feel confident when I am in the sun that I am protected.  </li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s mineral based I even use it on my toddler , which makes her giggle and think she&#x27;s putting on makeup -- much easier than fighting her to apply liquid lotion to her face before swimming!</li>
      <li>I have used it for a year and love how sheer it is.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>It always seems that when I find something I really like, the manufacturer quits making it</li>
      <li>Really like this item.</li>
      <li>with the brush application my hands stay dry and the powder is easy to apply even on sweaty skin</li>
      <li>so much easier than liquid sunscreen and such a quick application.</li>
      <li>Since I use Bare Mineral make up, it blends right in.  </li>
      <li>I prefer a natural look and  enjoy being outdoors as much as possible.  </li>
      <li>This product was highly recommended to me by my dermatologist when I got a laser procedure done on my face.</li>
      <li>I have started my family and friends on this sunscreen and highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I am very sun sensitive.  </li>
      <li>I live in Arizona.</li>
      <li>It gives a very natural look.  </li>
      <li>Only trouble with this product, though I&#x27;ve used it for several years is the inability to clean the brush easily while product is in the tube.</li>
      <li>A convenient and easy non messy way to wear sun protection.</li>
      <li>Also, when you finish the sunscreen, you can purchase a refill of the sunscreen, and continue to use the same applicator,  which is much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I am new to this product; less than 6 months and so far, I really like the results.  </li>
      <li>It is not messy or sticky like the sunscreens I have used before, and it does not burn your eyes when you apply it to your face, I use this sunscreen on my face daily, applying it on my face before I put on my make up.</li>

<li> It is not messy or sticky like the sunscreens I have used before, and it does not burn your eyes when you apply it to your face, I use this sunscreen on my face daily, applying it on my face before I put on my make up.</li>
<li> I spent the last two weeks in Hawaii and had no problem with the sun at all!  </li>
<li> I think I will keep using this for a long time.</li>
<li> Is this something you will carry long term?  </li>
<li> With that said, I use medium, so there is a slight tint if you are wearing white, probably avoidable if you use the white version, but I don&#x27;t want to look like a ghost.</li>
<li> It lasts a very long time.  </li>
<li> Just use a brush cleaner or dish washing liquid, swirl the suds, rinse it out, pat dry, without bending the bristles and leave upright to dry.</li>
<li> I ordered Medium and it may be a touch too dark for me especially now that I keep protecting my skin</li>
<li> love the product, it just took a long time to arrive :(</li>
<li> This sunscreen comes in a few different shades, so sometimes I put this sunscreen on without my makeup.</li>
<li> The product works ok, but too expensive for the poor packaging and quantity.  </li>
<li> With daily use, I hardly ever worry about sun exposure.  </li>
<li> After it arrived 3 days late I found out it was only half the amount that I could have paid $27.</li>
<li> Less then half the price.&lt;br</li>
<li> but you can keep your existing brush and cut down on waste.</li>
<li> It wears well throughout the day without the powder setting into the little wrinkles.  </li>
<li> A few months ago I was working with my skin doctor&#x27;s office getting chemical peels to reduce my acne every month.</li>
<li> It is small enought to carry in a small purse.  </li>
<li> Wish it were less expensive.</li>
<li> It is very expensive for a sunscreen, so I was a little hesitant to buy it.</li>
<li> and I hate running out.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t leave home with out it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Wish it were less expensive. But, I&#x27;ve thrown away good money on a number of cheaper powders, and nothing looks as good or works as well as this product.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift but the recipient loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love it!  No greasy cream or spary on my face.</li>
    <li> love love love--best spf powder out there.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  Perfect if you have adverse affects from cream sunblock. It lasts a very long time.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I use this to buff onto a zinc oxide-based mineral sunscreen that I love but gives a whitish cast.  This is the perfect solution as it evens out the color AND provides even more sun protection.  I will definitely repurchase and may try a lighter color next time.  I ordered Medium and it may be a touch too dark for me especially now that I keep protecting my skin and it&#x27;s getting fairer!</li>
    <li> Refill because it was great the first time around.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave home without this stuff.  It&#x27;s so easy to apply and has such a high amount of Zinc in it that I feel confident when I am in the sun that I am protected.  This is a must have for me.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only way I can keep sunscreen on my children&#x27;s and husbands face!</li>
    <li> I am very sun sensitive.  I keep this in my car for easy application wherever I go.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial sunscreen I have ever used. I use it for everything from driving in my car to running a marathon.</li>
    <li> I am new to this product; less than 6 months and so far, I really like the results.  It is easy to apply and reapply.  It is small enought to carry in a small purse.  I spent the last two weeks in Hawaii and had no problem with the sun at all!  I wish that the manufacture would come up with something for the rest of my body.</li>
    <li> So convenient to reapply sunscreen after you already applied your makeup.  According to dermatologists, you need to reapply sunscreen  every 2 -3 hours. I like the tinted one since it is similar to regular foundation powder and helps reduce oily sheen in my face.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t figure this is one application: every sunscreen has to be reapplied, but this doesn&#x27;t build up or get chalky.  Feels great and helps block shine, too.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Finding 50 SPF is usually not easy, but here is the perfect, non-greasy and portable solution. Forget about the shiny after glow of regular topical SPF. Just swish the translucent powder over your face, throw in your bag and reapply as needed throughout the day. I put this on after I&#x27;ve done my make up. I swirl on the fine powder on the backs of my hands before driving, and on my exposed neck and chest.  With that said, I use medium, so there is a slight tint if you are wearing white, probably avoidable if you use the white version, but I don&#x27;t want to look like a ghost. Also, this product is the refill, which is another great feature the other brush on SPF products lack.

Just use a brush cleaner or dish washing liquid, swirl the suds, rinse it out, pat dry, without bending the bristles and leave upright to dry. Then put in the refill powder and you&#x27;re all set!</li>
    <li> As always, this stuff is great!!! A convenient and easy non messy way to wear sun protection. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Product originally recommend to me by dermatologist.  I have used it for a year and love how sheer it is.  I prefer a natural look and  enjoy being outdoors as much as possible.  With daily use, I hardly ever worry about sun exposure.  Oh, if you want a little more cover use the sunforgettable face primer spy 30, you&#x27;ll love how it glides on!</li>
    <li> Great sun protection and cosmetic too!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product from my dermatologist before and was very pleased.  This time they did not have a refill available so I thought I would get it from Amazon even though it was $3. more.  After it arrived 3 days late I found out it was only half the amount that I could have paid $27. for. Go to a dermatologist before order it from this site.  Less then half the price.&lt;br /&gt;Oh Yeah!  It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> love! so much easier than liquid sunscreen and such a quick application. Since it&#x27;s mineral based I even use it on my toddler , which makes her giggle and think she&#x27;s putting on makeup -- much easier than fighting her to apply liquid lotion to her face before swimming!</li>
    <li> happy I could use my old applicator with this new refill worked out beautifully and saved a lot of money</li>
    <li> Only trouble with this product, though I&#x27;ve used it for several years is the inability to clean the brush easily while product is in the tube.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice, but I did find that it does seem to find itself everywhere</li>
    <li> My toddler son loves this sunscreen and so do I.</li>
    <li> Love the ease of being able to brush it on and it&#x27;s portable in the purse or beach bag without the greasy mess.  Needs to be applied about every two hours if in the water...otherwise once or twice a day.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I was working with my skin doctor&#x27;s office getting chemical peels to reduce my acne every month. This sunscreen/makeup powder is what they use on all their patients and though I no longer get peels I still use this as my powder when I put on my makeup every day. It does not clog my pores and the sunscreen protects my very fair and sensitive (Irish) complexion. I think I will keep using this for a long time.</li>
    <li> The product works ok, but too expensive for the poor packaging and quantity.  I wish they could come up with a better case so it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Best sun screen on the market.  It is so easy to use and you forget it is on.  No mask feeling on your face.</li>
    <li> love the product, it just took a long time to arrive :(</li>
    <li> Really like this item. Ordered as a refill replacement. Great way to apply sunscreen on a hot day.  Also, can be applied over makeup.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  Is this something you will carry long term?  It always seems that when I find something I really like, the manufacturer quits making it or I can no longer find it.  Let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I am a man and I use this product. It is not makeup. If goes on invisibly. I live in Arizona. So, sweat is inevitable. This product does not run in to my eyes, like regular sunscreen. I use it on my children&#x27;s faces as well.</li>
    <li> so easy sunscreen powder.</li>
    <li> I wear this product when I play tennis outdoors and am sweating profusely ....with the brush application my hands stay dry and the powder is easy to apply even on sweaty skin</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and love knowing my skin is protected.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended to me by my dermatologist when I got a laser procedure done on my face. It is very expensive for a sunscreen, so I was a little hesitant to buy it. But once the dermatologist showed me how easy it was to use, I decided to give it a try.  The sunscreen is in a powder form and comes with a built it brush, so you just remove the cap, and brush the sunscreen onto your face. It is not messy or sticky like the sunscreens I have used before, and it does not burn your eyes when you apply it to your face, I use this sunscreen on my face daily, applying it on my face before I put on my make up. Since I use Bare Mineral make up, it blends right in.  This sunscreen comes in a few different shades, so sometimes I put this sunscreen on without my makeup. I have started my family and friends on this sunscreen and highly recommend this product.  Also, when you finish the sunscreen, you can purchase a refill of the sunscreen, and continue to use the same applicator,  which is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! This is my 3rd order and I hate running out. It goes on almost clear, blends well, and it really is water resistant, great for sensitive skin, and perfect for humid Florida.</li>
    <li> The absolute best and easiest way to get the maximum sun protection.</li>
    <li> This is great for keeping up with the powder sunblock.  It wears well throughout the day without the powder setting into the little wrinkles.  It gives a very natural look.  I love it and use it every day.</li>
    <li> Great product, I also really like the fact that it contains sunscreen, which many similar products lack.</li>
