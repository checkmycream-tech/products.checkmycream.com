<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice shaver gives me a close shave, and is very quiet and easy clean up  with water. Had a Braun before and that shaver required ear plugs it was so noisy.</li>
    <li> It does the job but could be better.</li>
    <li> I love the long battery life.</li>
    <li> My previous Norelco razor (top of the line 15 years ago) was great, but finally gave up the ghost (stopped holding a charge).  So I researched all the current Norelco models and opted for the 1290/46.  They have several other models that are similar and I suspect that all share the same basic advantages, although specific details vary slightly.  I love this new razor.  It is quieter; it provides a closer shave (I shave dry, but it will also shave wet).  Very easy to clean (an advantage over my old razor).  At first, I was concerned that the new one only provides 60 minutes on a charge (my old one would go about 115 minutes).  But since this one rests on a little charging stand, that is no problem; in fact, I like it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like the strange design of the three floating heads sticking up from the basic unit.  But again, I find that I like it better.  The heads are so flexible that they are able to service areas that were always difficult with my previous razor (e.g., areas under my jaw bone).  I think that because of this head design, one is less likely to press harder, trying to get a closer shave (a false strategy).  Just lightly glide these heads  over the skin and--voila--a nice close shave with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I have no vested interest in Norelco!  But I am sold on this razor.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a Norelco for many years with good results.  It was never as close as a real shave with a razor, but you could not beet the convenience and speed of the Norelco.  The Sensotouch was a significant improvement as it shaves as close as a razor with even more convenience as I can shave in the shower and rince the heads clean when I am finished.  I was impressed!</li>
    <li> Gifts for my BF and daddy, and my first order from Amazon USA. Hope will be a wonderful beginning and pleasant surprise, for me and my honeys ~</li>
    <li> Was brought as a present for someone who suffers from skin cancer on their face. He tells me that it does a very good job for him without any of the problems a regular blade shaver would do to the skin on his face. He seems very happy with this shaver. I am glad I brought it for him.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.. Best electric razor ever!</li>
    <li> The motor does not seem to have the same power as my old one.</li>
    <li> I bought this product nearly a year ago, and right out-of-the-box it shaved terribly. I suspect it was returned before, and somebody switched the new head for a used one. When I got around to shopping for new head I noticed they were discontinued, and replaced with a cheaper made inferior product that doesn&#x27;t shave as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Norelco! I just threw 220 out the window.</li>
    <li> terrible company makes terrible products!  At first they played bait and switch on the head piece, original head was much more better made and smoother, for financial gain reason they make cheap knockoff replacement head to go with it and killed this product instantly!  But do those bigwigs blood suckers care? hell no, they already made a small fortune from selling them.  It serves them better when we don&#x27;t like the replacement head, because they think we are very likely to buy a new shaver from them.  oh yea! more money for them right?!  NOT ME! I am sick and tired of having to put up with company&#x27;s ill business practice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the replacement head issue, another incident made me despite this company even further.  My shaver gone bad about a month ago, it starts shaking uncontrollably for few seconds then shuts itself off every times I try to turn it on.  Called customer service and you know what? because I missed my warranty for just merely few days they void to offer me repair/replacement, on my $300+ purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE LEARN FROM ME AND MANY OTHER DISAPPOINTING CUSTOMERS, DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM PHILIPS NORELCO AGAIN!</li>
    <li> A good razor, but for the price there has to be better options. Takes at least three passes to clear each spot.</li>
    <li> Very quiet. Good battery life. Easy to clean with brush or water. Close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> This is the best elec razor I have ever owned. I ordered another one for our summer home too. Never pulls and smooth. You can&#x27;t go wrong on this one!!!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Much more comfortable than other razors.</li>
    <li> The brandnew 1290x just CAN NOT charge! Purchased it for my friend and the feedback from my friend is that it has been sent to customer service and it will take 1 week to fix it!!!</li>
    <li> A great shaving razor and the quietest one I have ever seen. But the design is faulty. It appears that Phillips is trying to sell more razors BY MAKING THE BATTERY NON- REPLACEABLE. After about three years you are supposed to throw away the $230 razor because the battery life will be used up and there is no way to change the battery. Shades of the Apple products. Additionally, they are now recommending that one buys a new head assembly every year. I&#x27;ve owned at least six different electric razors and this is the first one that pushes changing heads every year. Another way to rip off the consumer. It&#x27;s a good razor if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase. It was a gift for my husband and he really liked it. Excellent product. His beard is abundant!</li>
    <li> I received the razor, charged it for an hour and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I called Norelco&#x27;s support line and after 15 minutes on hold the rep told me that I had to let it charge for 8 hours before it would work. I questioned this since the razor showed a full charge and was told again that it has to charge for 8 hours. I knew this was BS but let it charge over night. Of course it wouldn&#x27;t start in the morning either. I figured that was a waste of time calling Norelco back so I emailed Amazon stating that it didn&#x27;t work and that I wanted to return it. Amazon emailed me in around 30 minutes saying that a replacement was on the way overnight and a link to a return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new razor seems to work fine, I just hope that I never have to deal with Norelco&#x27;s support again. Great job to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever had.  Use it both wet and dry; wet is best but dry is pretty darn good.</li>
    <li> Replaces ones that I had  just like it</li>
    <li> All the ratings were great so I sent for it, and my husband loves loves it. He said it&#x27;s the best shave he&#x27;s had in a long time!</li>
    <li> I have a 1060x my wife bought it for Xmas.Worst shaver ever . Not a close shave takes forever to get close.I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.No adjustments terrible trimmer.My Wife paid over $150 for this crap. I loved my Norelco rechargable 4950 had that almost 25 yrs.With this new on blades are close to $85.My AA battery Braun pocket shaver for $20 blows it away hand down.</li>
    <li> I feel very good, very love.</li>
    <li> It has been a few weeks and I like the razor so far.  I&#x27;ve had cheaper Norelco razors in the past and this is definitely a step up.  I prefer shaving wet to dry with this razor but it does a very good job either way.</li>
    <li> I had an older model that used the Nivea gel for shaving and as I can no longer find the blades and gel I knew I needed a new razor soon.  I looked at all the reviews and decided that I really liked norelco brand so I chose this one after looking at the available models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: wet/dry operation was vital as I shave in the shower.  This one works well.  Close, tho not as close as previous, shave.  Digital readout of minutes left before charge needed. Short charge time.  Ergonomic design but it is large.  So you women may find it difficult to shave with this one.  Clean out indicator that tells you when you need to clean the head. Lock for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not as close as previous shaver.  The head is much thicker, making it more difficult to shave right under your nose.  Charging stand is an origami nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it has potential to last a few years. If it fails I will repost</li>
    <li> had it 6 months and the battery is dead  how do i replace the battery or do i have to send it out</li>
    <li> It gives me a better shave and closer then a razor blade,  great product I would recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> I got this about 5 months ago.  Previously, I was a Gilette blade guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does a *decent* job, in a rush.  My job doesn&#x27;t require me to be spotlessly clean - just somewhat well groomed.  If I were a salesman or a lawyer or something, I would probably have stuck with a blade, but for basic day-to-day shaving, this isn&#x27;t bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it with various shave gels and lotions.  Tried it in the shower, tried it wet, tried it dry.  I am Sam I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just shaving dry seems to be the best bang for my time.  I can do a pretty decent job in about 2 minutes with it, and I use it pretty much daily.  It always misses a few of the thicker hairs, and around my goatee it&#x27;s a bit sporadic, but for the most part - it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, and he loves it.  The shave is close.  He prefers the dry shave over the wet shave.  He says that it is easy to clean.  I pointed out the negative reviews regarding the battery, so he is careful to only leave the shaver plugged in for 60 minutes.</li>
    <li> Had gotten a staff infection due to a nick when using a straight edge razor.  Converted to the Norelco 3d and I use it with shaving gel and I get a closer shave then with a blade and I can go over the same area with no irritation.  They have come along way with electric razors and this one if fantastic.  A little pricey but worth it.  Easy cleaning, operation and accessories.</li>
    <li> Not as good as a blade, but the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  Since I have curly hair that tends to lie flatter to my face, electric razors have always been a problem, but this Sensotouch does a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also agree with the manufacturers recommendation/comment that it takes a couple of weeks for your face to get use to the razor.  Both the razor and I do a much better job now in my fourth week with it, than the first few days...</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco 1290X/46 Sensotouch 3D Electric Razor,This shaver is useful, but shaving is very good.Use is great.I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Spectacular in performance except for trimmer which does not clean cut. Directions could be made more clear and readable. Space age!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as described.</li>
    <li> Best investment I ever made great great razor. Decided to buy the best and that is exactly what u got. Not a fan of having to shave much less buying a new razor every 2 days.  Very pleased</li>
    <li> Within a week of use, the display would no longer climb to 60 minutes while the unit was being charged. It went to 56, and on subsequent days down to 41. I returned it to Norelco, received a replacement, which quickly exhibited the same problem, but with an eventual maximum readout of 48. So I tried running the unit until it stopped. Surprisingly, after the display flashed 00, the motor continued to run for an hour, then charged back to 52 minutes. Perhaps the fact that after washing the heads under hot water I spray them with rubbing alcohol plays a role. But I prefer the 1260x, which has only bars indicating the charge level, not numbers.&lt;br /&gt;As for cleaning the heads individually, I&#x27;ve never found that to be necessary.</li>
    <li> Have had a Norelco fixed head electric razor for a long time.  Still working great after several years with no head replacement. So far believe I get a better shave with the old one.</li>
    <li> The razor would not charge. It was returned for a second razor &amp; it would not work either. The second razor was returned for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon gets a 5 star for there handling of the exchange and refund.</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver as a gift for my boyfriend and it stopped working after about 3 weeks of use. It started with razor getting louder when in use and eventually stopped holding a charge. I&#x27;m guessing the unit I received was defective, but at this price point one expect the shaver to last at least a year.</li>
    <li> Husband is only giving this 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t recharge completely; otherwise, it works fine.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco electric shavers over several decades. About 4 years ago, I replaced a worn-out Norelco with a Panasonic. Although the Panasonic worked OK in the beginning, after replacing the blades and foil twice, the performance made shaving agonizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally decided to switch back to the Norelco and ordered the Sensotouch 3D, I was totally surprised at how much the Norelco product had evolved since purchasing my last one - perhaps 10 years ago. This new model is incredibly comfortable to shave with and works much better on my beard than the Panasonic - even when the Panasonic was new. In addition, the battery lasts a very long time between charges - up to 2 weeks for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and makes shaving almost fun.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a major improvment over some of the cheap shavers Norelco has put out the past few years. I quickly fell in love with the close shave. My wife loves it too because I get a nice &amp; neat close shave.</li>
    <li> My grizzeled 84 year old beard has again met it&#x27;s match.&lt;br /&gt;This new Norelco replaces an earlier Norelco I have kept running for like 30 + years.&lt;br /&gt;A bit expensive but seems to be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Works good.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> This shaver is much better for me than the &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; type (like Braun, Panasonic, etc).  The 3 flexible round heads really hug my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it stinks at getting the hairs on my neck and just under my jaw, so I need to touch up with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is twice as good wet as it is dry.  Try it in the shower with a cream-type shaving lotion.  The kind in a tube, not in a can.  Burt;s Bees is really good.</li>
    <li> Very good, I like it very much,Save electricity,Small voice.Is there any discount, buy again a few.As a gift for a friend</li>
    <li> WOW What a Deal an Its GREAT SOOOOOO NICE</li>
    <li> After charging with a hand, just charge it into electricity, take tests, said that the host is out of order, to the entire repair, fix the price is expensive, than my machine to repair, but the husband said this is very useful</li>
    <li> I had to return it becasue i couldnt wait... Bought the same one from a local guy and paid a few bucks more.... wish my old shaver didnt drop dead when it did.... i just needed a few more days and could have saved a few more bucks....</li>
    <li> I like my new razor, but my favorite was an older model (Presidential).  The Presidential seemed to glide across my face.  However, while this model provides a close shave, it does not glide across my face as easily as the older model.  As such, the shave is a bit rougher.</li>
    <li> Wow this thing is quiet and pretty good too.  I used it dry and didnt like how it felt as good as when I used it wet and with some shaving cream.  Great job of getting 99% of the facial hair off but still needed my razor for one or two passes to really get it down to my liking.  Definitely cut down on my skin iritation with the razor. Just got product yesterday though so I will give it some time.  But I like it so far.  UPDATE:  Shaver power button stopped working.  No matter how hard you press the button area it won&#x27;t turn on.  Pathetically poor design.  Also they stopped making the original shaver heads so I was forced to buy the replacement head which is inferior to the original heads.  I will not purchase this product again.  It was great when I first got it. Now it&#x27;s a $220 paper weight.  I can no longer recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for a couple of weeks now.  I use it in the shower with shaving cream or gel.  It works as designed and gives me a quick, close shave.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, but dumbest charger that doen&#x27;t travel well at all! Already &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; one, whivh is why I purchased a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, too expensive,,but...&lt;br /&gt;The protection cap is a joke also as it breaks so easily, and no, at the highway robbery replacement price of $14.-- I am getting used not to have one. Too bad as that shaver itself is best.&lt;br /&gt;So, some engineers at Philips Norelco are grest, some other not!</li>
    <li> They have discontinued the RQ12 (this unit). You can&#x27;t get replacement heads for this anymore. They make you use the heads from the RQ11 and RQ10. They have the RQ12+ heads but it&#x27;s the same thing as the lesser models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you Philips! After many years of loyalty to your brand I have bought a Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This used this shaver for less then a year. :(</li>
    <li> I ended up returning it because of Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policy.  I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a DE razor for a couple years now, and wanted something faster for those early mornings.  I know razor burns/bumps are supposed to go away over time once you get used to the razor, but I couldn&#x27;t stand to keep going with it.  I also had to go over and over the same spots, and would still find I missed areas (tried both wet and dry).  I thought it was a pretty big design over site that you couldn&#x27;t keep the unit in its charging station (like a toothbrush).  Having to be that careful with charging the battery should not be an issue...even in a low end razor.  The quality of this razor is pretty top notch, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for some...just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razors for 19 yrs.  The first 13 were dry shavers that left my skin irritated.  The last razor was the kind that squirted the &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; it did a great job of shaving but I always had to keep filling the expensive goo and it started to smell funky.  The batteries were fading so I thought I would try this razor and pair it with a good shaving cream - C.O. Bigelow.  Really no skin irritation even better than the goo razor!  The head is bigger so it is harder to get some ares without a bit more work.&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about filling the goo before I leave, however I didn&#x27;t like the travel lock on this razor.  It said it was &amp;#34;automatic&amp;#34; but it takes 5 minutes of movement before it automatically locks.  One trip later and it didn&#x27;t automatically lock and I was left with a dead razor and didn&#x27;t bring the charger for a 2 day trip.  So I bought the 1260 model as a travel razor - that has a manual lock so I can be more confident it won&#x27;t be dead when I arrive.  This works well for me as they both use the same charger and most of my flights are early morning and the last thing I want to do at that time is try to remember to pack a razor after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this razor (and the 1260) long battery runs and a good wet shave.  I tried a dry shave - once and won&#x27;t do that ever again.</li>
    <li> A great razor, easy to use ,gives a close shave, would recommend this product for sure, worth the price ,</li>
    <li> I am  long time Norelco user. My old 9160XL-the head fell apart- The 1290X3D I bought has design problems--1. you need to plug in and  use the stand to charge- that means you need pack and take it with you when you travel--it is plastic and subject to breaking since there is no way to pack it- the pouch only holds the razor  2. to clean --you need to open all 3 of the razor heads and if you air dry with out the holder at least one of the heads will close when you place the razor on its side --3.. The trimmer seems harder to use &#x3D;when trimming the hair on the side of the head---OVERALL I THINK THE  CHEAPER MODELS WHICH ARE ABOUT  HALF THE PRICE WILL DO THE SAME JOB WITH OUT THE ABOVE PROBLEMS AND I FEEL WILL HAVE LESS FUTURE PROBLEMS;</li>
    <li> After years of nicking my face I came back to Norelco.  Love this new razor with it wet &amp; dry features.  A smooth shave with no skin irritation.  I do not dread shaving in the morning anymore.  I used it right out of the box after charging.  Easy to use and clean.  Thanks Norelco</li>
    <li> Most popular, and high quantity and price. I like it very much ! A lot of useful units, a wise and powerful shave</li>
    <li> I expected, very Recommended</li>
    <li> Good razor with reasonable price! My dad love it ! I gonna buy one for myself in the future. Good!</li>
    <li> Been using it for 4 months now. gives a close shave almost as good as a blade.  Cleans quickly under running water. charges quickly, enjoy using it..  I told a friend about it and he loves it.</li>
    <li> As with all my previous Norelco razors, this one is better than the last. Only issue is making certain it is in the charger correctly.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for years and years.  I had to replace a 1280x due to battery failure and no way to replace it.  That is a built in obsolescence problem.  Good for Norelco and bad for the consumer...</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razors for over 50 years. I also tried almost every other electric razor available. This is absolutely the best razor ever. I am an engineer and can appreciate the wonderful engineering job that Phillips has done since they bought out Norelco. The razor glides smoothly over my face, contouring to every sharp and rounded spot on my chin because of its extreme flexibility. It  cuts closer than I can  with a multi-bladed standard razor, without all the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the most ingenious new feature is the fact that the Rotary cutting blades completely open and can be easily washed clean with a faucet after every shave. This lack of messy buildup allows a fresh clean shave each time the razor is used. Normally my Norelco razors have lasted at least 5 years. Because of this feature I am hoping that this one will have similar longevity, but it has more flexible parts, and that has yet to be determined.(I have had the razor for three years now). This is definitely the best razor you can buy, and because of its expected longevity, it becomes a good bargain, even at this high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another important feature is the remarkable battery. After a full charge (it gave me 72 minutes), I used this razor for 31 days without recharging. That means when I travel, I very seldom have to take along a charger. That&#x27;s important for someone who travels a lot. Kudos to Norelco!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this razor for 3 yrs now, and have not replaced the heads. It still works almost as good as new, but it takes more strokes to shave now than in the beginning. Initially I shaved in 2 minutes, now 3 to 4 minutes. It is also better to shave every day as it pulls a little on longer beards. I could replace the heads, but won&#x27;t because of the battery reduction outlined below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: at 2 yrs and 4 months, the charge dropped from 72 minutes to 61 minutes. At 2 yrs and seven months it dropped again to 55 minutes. At 2 yrs 9 months it dropped to 49 minutes. At 3 years it is at 45 minutes for full charge. It is still great, but I am taking a star away because of the reduction in full charge times, and the fact that it does not have a separate cord for charging; it must be charged in the cradle, which is inconvenient to pack when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At four years this razor is still nearly perfect. I opened the three heads and thoroughly washed them for 3 years. Finally it started to pull and I thought I needed a new one. I read the manual for the first time and was surprised that you could take it apart and clean the blades independently; who knew? After a thorough cleaning including soaking in alcohol, it returned to near new shaves. I noticed that it shaved poorer when I let the battery get low, and I started leaving it in the charge cradle all the time. The charged time returned to 53 and has been steady there for some time. I am restoring the one star, because it is amazing that this razor has been so good for so long. Now, I am looking forward to making 5 years, then buying another one. I have never replaced the head on this one, and I still shave in 3 minutes with no pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of the &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34;: 9300. Read the reviews and buy this one.utes for full charge.

    <li> I already knew this razor ..&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how it works shave very gently and do not irritare&lt;br /&gt;It is excellent</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;ll say this is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, so I have nothing to compare it to other than a regular razor. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a regular razor, but the convenience more than makes up for it. I still shave with a real razor about once a week, but most days I find this electric razor is good enough to get me through the day, and it takes only a fraction of the time of traditional shaving. The battery charge lasts forever, and I like the digital gauge that tells you how much time is left on the battery. Also, the travel case is pretty durable and convenient to throw in a suitcase. It takes an hour to charge, and one of the only drawbacks is the instructions warn you not to overcharge it. This isn&#x27;t a big deal, since I usually set the timer on my cell phone to remind me to unplug it. So really, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving razor. Only thing missing ... For the price it should come and shave me before I get out of bed!</li>
    <li> The shaver is great, however I ordered the &amp;#34;frustration free&amp;#34; packaging option and the wrong charging stand was included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Norelco and they are sending the correct stand, but I would recommend just ordering the standard packaging version.</li>
    <li> Since purchasing this shaver in late September 2013 -- and following the recommended three-week &#x27;break-in&#x27; period -- I have experienced great results on my face (and my head).  It is unlikely I will ever revert back to a blade and shaving cream.  Just be sure to use a good pre-shave lotion with this this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been some comments here expressing frustration with the charge readout gradually decrementing below \\&quot;60\\&quot; (minutes) after each successive charge.  I experienced the same symptom, even though the manual says this should not be construed as a reduction in the actual amount of shaving time remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my fix for restoring the battery charge readout to 60 minutes: (1) After shaving (and before cleaning the razor), allow the razor to run continuously, EVEN after it reads \\&quot;00\\&quot;. It should stop running completely in about 7-9 minutes after it reads \\&quot;00\\&quot;. DO NOT turn off the razor while it is running down. After it finally stops, clean the razor according to the instructions, then recharge it. After about an hour, the charge readout should show \\&quot;60\\&quot;. I have performed this procedure twice since buying my 1290X/46 in late September, and the razor now consistently recharges back to \\&quot;60\\&quot; minutes after each session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that you perform this procedure at your own risk, and it may void your warranty. I am not responsible for any damage that may occur to the battery.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different models ands brands just to be disappointed. After much research and contemplating I pulled the trigger on the norelco 1290 and I can&#x27;t be happier. I have one of those relentless growing beards and sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t do the blade every other day. I can&#x27;t say anything about longevity but this is the closest shaving electric shaver ever. From checks to neck it just works flawlessly from day one.</li>
    <li> My last razor, Braun, gave me a close shave and I thought I loved it. I accidentally broke it and wondered if there was yet a better razor; how lucky I was to break it.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun would actually cut my skin. People thought I used a blade as often as I got cut.&lt;br /&gt;My 3D is not only the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten but it the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten and it&#x27;s quiet (my wife loves that).&lt;br /&gt;If you have had a hard time getting a comfortable close shave, this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> This is best electric razor I have owned to date. Easy to use, cut both long and short hair. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a very good shaver.</li>
    <li> The razor left a burning sensation when I shaved.  I had to shave several times over the same area.  It also took much longer to shave with this razor and I was not happy with the end results.  My last shaver was a Norelco and I was much happier with it, that is why I purchased this one.  I will be returning this product back for the simple reason that I am not happy at all with it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this piece of crap at any cost. First of all, you aren&#x27;t able to buy the original head to replace it with because Norelco has discontinued it. You can get on Amazon or Ebay for $150!! Almost as much as it costs to buy this junk metal. They came up with a replacement head that is horrible. 2nd, the battery died on me completely after 2 years. And yes, you can&#x27;t get a full 60 minutes of charge. Only 55 minutes. And I always had to worry about overcharging this junk metal as the instructions say not to keep it charged once the piece of crap finishes charging up. But I don&#x27;t have time to watch this junk charging!!</li>
    <li> Very  efficient. I experience a very close shave with my new shaver  I have used Norelco for many years and I have always had good results</li>
    <li> This razor gives the closest shave I have ever had in my life from any of the electric razors I have owned.</li>
    <li> Did not produce a remotely quality shave for a daily shaver.  I&#x27;d avoid if you need a clean shave on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My unit began making a terrible noise after a few shaves.  Sent it back for a full refund through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Nothing like owning a great electric razor.  The weight is nice and I like the 3 head design.  I&#x27;ve owned Braun in the past with the normal one screen head, and this new Philips is just something else.  Sure it takes a little more room in the toiletry bag, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor on Aug 2,13 and have used it pretty much daily since then. It does not shave as close as a Gillette Fusion but the hassle factor is much less and I do not have to run to the store to buy blades as often. It is the best electric shave I have had and comes pretty close to a blade shave. It does not leave my face as sore as a blade as I have a thick beard and have to shave against the grain with a blade to avoid 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I have used it in NY and London and it works and charges without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why four stars? The number of minutes after charging have been steadily going down from 60 to the current 49 so I do not know when it will become difficult to use on trips. I exhaust the charge to the point where the red arrow shows before recharging, so not sure what the secret is. I would really like it to go back to 60 minutes per charge.</li>
    <li> Have had other Norelco products which were very good to great and this particular razor rates a &#x27;great&#x27;. Instructions are a bit &#x27;wieldy&#x27; but get one up to &#x27;snuff&#x27; to enjoy putting them to work learning, and using, this razor. Our gift to each other!</li>
    <li> Frustration free packaging was frustrating as when the Amazon box was open the razor was not in a box of any form for wrapping. Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and was disappointed in how it had to be wrapped - no nice box. Most frustrating was that the charger was not the right one. Fortunately, Amazon is will to pay for the return and although they cannot exchange I can reorder.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shaver.  Close and smooth shave.  Easy to clean.  Quality product.  It&#x27;s not cheap but the quality makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> delivered on time, frustration free packaging was easy to open, I plugged it in and 1 hour later I got a great dry shave, you don&#x27;t have to make to many passes to get a clean shave. It&#x27;s very quite compared to my old Braun shaver. I can&#x27;t wait for my beard to grow back out so tomorrow I can try it again, this time with shaving gel. would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because I was impressed with the reviews and advertisements. However, when I received the package, the three cutter blades in the head assembly were missing. I contacted Amazon but no response from them. I guess that Amazon wants me to buy the cutter blades again. This is unfair but I suspect that I have no choice.</li>
    <li> This would have to the best electric shaver I have used . Smooth close shave, no rasping or hairs catching as I shave. Excellent for the price, I have owned more expensive shavers in the past, and this is the first I have ever recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great，I love it.</li>
    <li> It is third Philips saver in 3years and it only last for a year. I had to return the previous two and today the third on did not work. Not a good experience with Philips and amazon</li>
    <li> Got it three days ago for father&#x27;s day. Got to a full charge after 30 minutes. Beautiful design, great numeric battery indicator, smooth shave, very flexible shaving heads, better than previous electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used electric shavers for last 10 years, but I always had to do final shave around the nose or certain areas of the face with a blade, not anymore, this shaver reaches all types of hair and provides a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that the blade replacement, after 1-2 years, is very expensive, but for now, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The build quality of this device is exceptional as is its performance. Cleaning the razor is a breeze, battery charging is fast and it lasts more than a week for me before needing a re-charge.</li>
    <li> Excellent - very quiet while providing a clean,  close shave.  Best razor that I have ever owned.  But our now!</li>
    <li> Great razor even though a bit pricey. I was able to get a nice rebate which reduced the price. I have had Norelco razors for many years and this is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> Provides a nice close shave. Easy to clean. Very quiet .</li>
    <li> This shaver performed as advertised.  Although shaver is still on trial basis, I will keep it.  This a great replacement for my older  Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> Enjoy very much. Does good job.</li>
    <li> Excellent model. shave clean and smooth, but there is one problem - hard Throw whiskey but it is a trifle compared with the ins .... easy to clean, fast charging, battery duration, elegant appearance and build quality.&lt;br /&gt;price-performance ratio somewhat unequally, but apparently this product for the rich)))) and we have it! )))</li>
    <li> Vey smooch, quiet, does cut large and small hairs, quick recharge time, fits hand well and is easy to move around.</li>
    <li> Beautiful!My father likes it very much! It makes my father more handsome !LOL It&#x27;s value to give 5 stars! good job!</li>
    <li> i am a customer from PR China, this product seems perfect than expected, using a visa card with refund makes the product better</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to replace his older Norelco Razor.  He loves this new razor and says it gives him a great shave,  He loves Norelco and saved the old razor which stays charged for 90 minutes to take on travel.</li>
    <li> Works well but not yet convinced it does any better than the AT 830 I purchased recently.  This one is much harder to clean.</li>
    <li> I like this razor but mostly to shave my head.  Because of how it&#x27;s built it feels good using it on my head and does a pretty good job.  As far as for my facial hair, I would give it a 3 because I have to go over the area a few times.  I was reading in &amp;#34;Grooming Secrets For Men&amp;#34; about using electric razors and that was helpful too.</li>
    <li> While this is a good shaver, like all electric shavers, you can bet a better shave using a razor. Not able to take more tha a couple of days growth without first triming it down before shaving.</li>
    <li> Updated 11-26-16.  Battery looks like it will not charge higher than 28-30 minutes.  Plus shaver is seizing up flashing the three symbols after 20 minutes of heavy shaving. Have to restart several times.  Don&#x27;t know whether the blame shaver or heads but the heads are about 10 months old.  Lowering to a 2.&lt;br /&gt;Update 1-1-16:  Now battery only shows 32 minutes even when fully charged and that is how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Update 5-16-15:  Battery will now only charge to 49 minutes even after fully draining.  Until recently it showed an extra 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review 8-31-13:&lt;br /&gt;This is the top of the line model except for one with the self-cleaning system that seems overkill and an unnecessary expense.  This shaver is definitely top notch, it&#x27;s light, shaves even a heavy beard, and carries a decent but not fantastic 60 minutes of battery life.  Two minor deficiencies are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) There is a countdown time for battery life but you can only see it after turning the razor off; the countdown should be visible during usage as well,  That would be a good way of timing your shave as well as letting you know if you have a minute or two left (previous top of the line Norelco razors had that ability).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The touch button to activate the razor is very sensitive, the razor can be activated during movement in luggage on a trip; you could arrive and find your razor has completely drained which would be disastrous if you didn&#x27;t bring the required stand and recharging cord.  There should be a travel lock which lesser models have but inexplicably this one does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two deficiencies are sufficient to lower the score to 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact you have to use a charging cord and stand is also annoying and means you have to take both on a trip (even a short trip due to the danger your razor will drain after being jostled in your luggage), but the stand does fold up fairly small.  I did not subtract a point for this but would subtract half a point if possible.</li>
    <li> Would purchase this razor for my sons but it is too pricey.  I bought it for my husband and he likes it.</li>
    <li> Out all the shaver out there this is the best it&#x27;s norelco top of line shaver the price is affordable threw amazon plus they got promotion you get 50$ off  so under 180$ this great price shaver works great close shave every time plus amazon has great service every to you call this shaver cost 249$  every where else</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my 3rd Norelco 1290X. I really like the shave for an electric. I would reccomend this razor for anyone looking for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> This thing is so well-designed, so well built, and works so well, that it&#x27;s fun to handle and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head assembly has 2 degrees of rotational freedom, and each of the 3 cutting heads has one, so calling it \\&quot;3D\\&quot; is not an exaggeration. It tracks facial contours very well. Each cutting head opens for cleaning, and closes for shaving, snapping solidly into both positions. The motor starts with the gentle \\&quot;kick\\&quot; of a speed control. There&#x27;s a mechanized cleaner available, but I just immerse the head in a glass of shaver cleaner with the motor running, and then rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the habit of using pre-electric shave, but I get a good shave with the Sensotouch using nothing at all. It&#x27;s approved for use in the shower, and idiot-proofed to prevent doing so with the power cord attached.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a Fusion safety razor, but it&#x27;s only a hair&#x27;s breadth away from a Fusion&#x27;s closeness.  The way the heads pop open in the middle sounds stupid, but it&#x27;s excellent, because the heads popping open that way make it easy to clean.  The digital readout is very practical and looks great.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a very good, close shave. I don&#x27;t use it with shaving cream so I can&#x27;t comment on that aspect. Save extra room in your carry on bag because this shaver is markedly bigger than the two dimentional triple header.</li>
    <li> I get a good shave from the 1290 X just as I did for 6 yr. on my old norelco, which broke when I dropped it and the head cracked</li>
    <li> Like all my other items fast mail, item works fantastically</li>
    <li> It is very good.&lt;br /&gt;it is quiet comfortable,  worth the price. You deserve it. It is more than you imagine.</li>
    <li> Quiet, smooth, comfortable, beautiful, energy-saving</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t seem to handle a few days growth so well. This is definitely an everyday razor or an every other day shaver. When used in this scenario, I have no complaints other than the smooth skin I&#x27;m left with.</li>
    <li> Electrics never get as close as a blade, but this one is close.  I use it w/ an electric shave prep and it works fine. No pulling, no irritation.</li>
    <li> Had to stop using my safety razor and had little expectation. What a good surprise. I struggle a little on my neck area but it works a lot better than I ever expected.</li>
    <li> Good razor, works at advertised. I do not put 5 stars because it still misses a fair amount of hair in the neck, it does not shave as closely as a regular Gilette fusion (for me the best manual razor).&lt;br /&gt;And I did not get rid of my neck irritations :(</li>
    <li> Be careful the replacement blades $115.00</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money.  Shaver gives me a better shave than either safety razor or foil razor in less time.  I get over 2 weeks of shaves on a single charge.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know what to say... I&#x27;ve spent maybe $800-1000 on electric razors over the past 5 years and had resorted to stubble with my hair clippers since I hated the fact all razors I tried would do a bad job, pull/tug at my whiskers which was utterly painful, require wet and/or gel/cream...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing tho...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE This thing, it&#x27;s bar none the best money I&#x27;ve spent. I was highly skeptical at first, and when I first put it to my face I was worried, I could hear it grinding away at my hair, but there was no pain, no pulling, i moved it around in circles on my cheek until the grinding noise was gone, then touched my cheek with my hand...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was pretty much as smooth as with a standard razor. I was so impressed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this a few weeks and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco since 1973 and have purchased the \\&quot;Top-Of-The-Line Model\\&quot; every time they come out with a new one.    My new one is the Norelco 1290.    First of all.. the appearance is just great.. along with the excellent build quality that Norelco seems to maintain year after year!    Shaving with this new model ...I consider it slightly above average.    They work well using the them as a \\&quot;Wet Shave\\&quot; but I use this model for \\&quot;Dry Shaves\\&quot;...I have other models for that.    It takes a little longer than average to shave my face with this model than with some of the other older Norelcos that I own  eg. Arcitec 1095 which is in this catergory.    I find that the shaving heads are a little too big and thick but they still do a fine job.    Every Norelco will shave your face...but the better models (in Design not just price) will shave your face quicker! This is basically the key ( for my testing) to the Norelco Shavers everytime a new one comes out for myself.    Alot of the people mention that you have to change shaving heads once a year....I change mine  every 5 -10 years. The secret is alot of people don&#x27;t use a Shaving Lotion\\&quot; on their face  \\&quot;Lelectric Shave\\&quot; for instance... before they shave... I do and that&#x27;s how my blades last so long.    I find these kinds of shavers ...since the Arcitec 1095 that I also own is best suited with the Jet Clean.    Some people may say...  \\&quot;Who needs a Jet Clean?\\&quot;...but they work especially well with these types of heads in this shaver catagory....and the convience is great!    I would recommend this shaver because if you look after them like I do....with this excellent build quality...it may be the last shaver you may ever have to buy...unless your like myself as a collector.    Is it worth it?.....Yes!....A \\&quot;Metal Version\\&quot; of the excellent Norelco 1280!</li>
    <li> I have used my 1290 3D razor for a couple of months. First I&#x27;ll cover what I don&#x27;t like or think should be improved upon. If the batteries are run down, the shaver cannot be used with the cord. There is no provision to plug the cord into the razor. The only way to charge the razor is to place it into the charging stand with the cord plugged into the charging stand. When you travel, you need to take the charging cord and the charging stand along with the razor but the travel pouch will only hold the razor by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the batteries reach their end of life, you will not be able to shave until you buy a new razor. Philips could have easily designed a recessed socket with brass pins in the bottom of the razor so it could be run with the cord and still be waterproof for a cordless wet shave. The attorneys probably told them some idiot would run an extension cord into the shower and electrocute himself. (A missed opportunity to thin out the idiots in the world). There are no provisions to replace the batteries and continue using the razor. You take a $250 razor and throw it in the landfill. This is unacceptable to me. It is environmentally irresponsible to make a product useless after a single battery life. The batteries should be replaceable so the razor can be used until the motor wears out, as has been the case for all the Norelco razors in the past. My last Norelco, a 985RX has lasted 17 years. I replaced the heads every year and had a local repair shop replace the batteries every 2 to 3 years for around $25. It still works and I&#x27;ll keep it around because I can still shave with it by plugging in the cord even when the batteries are dead. The 985RX was the top of the line Norelco in December 1995 when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid my old razor would die so I decided to try the new 3D. It does shave closer than my old Norelco. When used for a dry shave, it does not shave as close as a blade. It does shave even closer when used wet. If the wet shave isnot as close as a blade, it&#x27;s pretty darn close to it. I don&#x27;t use a gel. I just wet my face with hot water for a minute or so before I shave. The hot water softens the hairs, causing them to swell up slightly, making them much easier to cut and opens the pores on the face. The water acts as a lubricant so you are left with a smooth, hydrated face, a very close shave and no razor burn. After a shave using water, I can just begin to feel a little stubble on my face after 4 to 5 hours. After a dry shave it is 1 to 2 hours. It really is a close comfortable shave without the need to be a \\&quot;Barber, Butcher and Paper Hanger\\&quot; as can be the case when using a blade and having a face covered with cuts and toilet paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The pivoting neck and heads do a very good job of following the contours of the face. The razor body is narrower than my old Norelco and tapers toward the end. It may be too small for those with large hands. Try it for yourself. Before I bought the Philips 3D I did try a Remington razor and it didn&#x27;t shave as closely as my old Norelco but it was only about a $70 Remington; hardly a fair comparison. I also tried a Norelco 8270 but it didn&#x27;t shave as well as my old Norelco either so I returned it for a refund. The top-of-the-line shaver is going to give you the best shave. You can&#x27;t get the best shave with an inexpensive razor, Duh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutters on a Norelco need to seat into the combs for the best shave. To speed up the process I would charge it and let it run down until there were only 10 minutes or so left and repeat the process 5 or 6 times. The shaves do get closer as the seating occurs. Overall I like the shave of my 3D but I wonder how long the batteries will last. If I am faced with having to shell out $250 for a new razor every few years along with paying $50 to $75 each year for new heads, I&#x27;ll start to look around at other premium razors. Philips should, in my opinion, go back to its roots and produce a top quality product that last a long time and has replaceable batteries and motors. Norelco owners love their razors and want to keep them running. In the past, Norelco has made its money by keeping its loyal customers happy and selling them new heads for their beloved razors. If Philips has changed to a \\&quot;quick buck\\&quot; sales model, they will not only lose their reputation but their loyal customers as well. Philips needs to realize that there is no substitute for quality. As a wise person once said, \\&quot;When you buy quality, you only cry once\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the 1290 over the other 3D razors because it had, at the time I purchased it, Philips&#x27; best cutter and comb set. If you compare, you will see the 1290 has a different arrangement of holes for stubble, slots for medium whiskers and channels for longer hairs than the less expensive 3D razors. At this writing, Philips may now be using these better heads on some of the less expensive razors because, it appears, Philips has discontinued the 1290 model. It is no longer shown on their web site.(NOTE: I checked the Norelco site and the 1290X is back on their site as of May 28, 2013) I do like the minutes left indicator. I find that with my 59 year old, light to moderate beard, I will take 7 to 10 minutes to shave every morning. I also use the 1290 to shave the back of my neck, below the blocked hairline, every day. When I first tried to turn on the razor I thought it was broken because it would not turn on by touching the power button. After a few frustrating minutes I found that it is NOT a touch screen but a physical button hidden beneath soft plastic. You must press hard enough to flex the body inward to activate the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be a real hassle having to clean the razor after every use but I have adapted to opening the three combs and washing each of them under the running hot water; first from the outside to the inside then from the inside to the outside. This daily ritual does keep the cutters and combs looking clean, brand new and ready to go for the next day. I leave the combs open and place the razor in the stand, closing them only after they have dried. If you dry shave, most of the whiskers will be loose in the hair chamber when you open the head. These can be tapped out in the sink or trash before rinsing. If you wet shave or use a preshave, there will be clumps of wet or oily whiskers in the hair chamber and probably between the cutters and combs. It is especially important to use hot water to dissolve and rinse out these clumps to keep the heads clean and properly functioning. After two months I removed the cutters to check for any build up of debris; there was none at all. My conclusion is that, for the way I shave, a hot water clean-up is all that is needed to keep the razor like new. There is no need for the cleaning system sold by Philips. Per the instructions I only charge the razor when it is run down to less than 10 minutes. Be sure to register your razor on the Philips web site to get an additional 6 months of warranty. That will give you a warranty of 2 ½ years instead of the standard 2 years. My wife found a great deal at Bed Bath and Beyond with a mail in rebate and a 20% off coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about the Travel Lock feature. The less expensive razors have the Travel Lock feature where you press and hold the power button for 3 seconds to put the razor in Lock mode. The 1290 has an automatic Power Saving mode that activates, well, .....automatically after sensing movement for 5 minutes while it is turned off. You can test this very simply. Set a countdown timer for 5 minutes then gently rock the razor in your hand for 5 minutes. As you move the razor, you will see the rings around the power button light up. When the razor goes into the Power Saving mode the rings around the power button stop illuminating and the Lock symbol at the very bottom of the razor will light up when there is movement. This saves power while traveling. You don&#x27;t have to do anything; it is all automatic. To take the razor out of the Power Saving mode, simply press the power button to turn it on. Neither the Travel Lock nor the Power Saving mode will keep the razor from being turned on if the power button is pushed. Pushing the power button is how you take the razor out of these modes and turn it on. The Power Saving mode just prevents the motion sensor from running the battery down from having the power switch LED blinking all the time due to movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movement sensor in the 1290 will cause the LED behind the power button to illuminate every time movement or vibration is sensed. Jarring the counter on which the razor is placed will trigger it. I&#x27;m not sure what the design purpose of this feature is other than to call attention to the razor when you are around it. I believe it is a feature that fills a much needed gap. Every time the razor is turned off the faucet symbol come on briefly to remind you to wash the heads under hot water. If the heads become clogged with debris, the faucet, exclamation point, and replace head symbols all illuminate to warn you to clean the razor before proceeding. After a year of use the replace head symbol will come on and the razor will beep to remind you to purchase a new head. The razor resets after three shaves. The minutes left indicator is only on briefly when the razor is first turned on or turned off. I prefer the design of my old Norelco which shows the minutes left continually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the battery problems some people have experienced, there is a good discussion of lithium batteries and chargers in the Comments area in the post by Michael C. Lefkowitz on December 4, 2010 here in the reviews of the 1290. An electrical engineer, Raymond Pipkin, says even the most basic chargers cannot overcharge a lithium battery and that the battery will not be ruined by being left on the charger continually. Once the battery reaches the charge voltage thecharger shuts off completely until the battery voltage drops to a predetermined level. Only then will the charger start a recharge cycle. There is no trickle charge as on other types of batteries. The maximum number of charge cycles will be obtained by recharging the battery when it is between 20% and 80%. The battery failures experienced by some users are most likely due to defective batteries supplied to Philips. Even the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is having problems with the quality of a few of its lithium batteries. Philips puts a 2½ year warranty on the 1290 when you register it on their website. If the battery or anything other than the shaving head fails, they will send you a new razor. I am not as concerned about battery failure as I am about how many years the battery will last and if Philips will come up with a way to replace the battery so I can continue to use the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging the battery will take up to one hour depending on the state of discharge. While charging, the display will flash to show the increasing minutes left. When the battery is charged it will display around 60 minutes left and stay on continuously for 30 minutes then go out. Best practice is to unplug the charger before the next use and not recharge the battery until it reaches somewhere between 20% and 80% charged. Do not discharge the battery completely. If you ever do run the battery down, recharge it immediately to prevent damage. Partial charges are fine. If you want to leave the shaver on the charger continually, it will not damage it, you just won&#x27;t get the maximum life out of the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sideburn trimmer is a little disappointing. It is narrower than on previous Norelco shavers and does not extend as far. For trimming side burns it is OK. If you try to trim your mustache the view of the trimmer is blocked by the shaving head. This can be remedied by simply removing the shaving head while you trim your mustache but it would be better if you didn&#x27;t haveto disassemble the razor to fully use the trimmer. The trimmer is serviceable for its function but that is about all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you spend $3 each week on blades and gel, that equates to $156 every year. For a three year period that would be $468. If you paid the full $250 price for the Norelco and bought replacement heads for the second and third year from Amazon at $52 each, that equates to $354. If you use a Bed Bath and Beyond 20% off coupon and send in their rebate you can get the razor for about $165. Add $104 for replacement heads and the cost for three years is only $269 compared to $468 for blades. The Norelco has a 2 ½ year warranty when you register it on the Philips web site. It looks like one can save almost $70 each year by buying the 1290 instead of using blades. If the 1290 lasts 4 years the cost would be $321 compared to $624 for blades. Yes, the 1290 costs more up front but the long term cost is about half the cost of blades. The longer the 1290 lasts, the greater your savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a 45 day trial period offering a full refund if you are not satisfied as well as a 2 ½ year warranty if you register your razor on the Philips web site, there isn&#x27;t much reason NOT to give the 1290 a try. If you don&#x27;t like it all you have lost is the return shipping and if you do like it, well . . . .  you have found something you like better than you are using now. It worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for spending the time to read this rather lengthy review. Please comment if you find errors or have ways to improve upon it. I would appreciate it if you would take the time to select if this review was helpful to you. Again, thank you for your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 17, 2013: If you send a razor back to Norelco for a refund, be sure to keep copies of all your paperwork and ship the razor so it can be tracked. Norelco told us they had no record of receiving the Model 8270 that I first purchased then returned for a refund after purchasing the 1290. My wife emailed them copies of everything as well as the tracking number showing it was signed for by someone at Norelco. We finally received a check for the razor itself but Norelco did not reimburse us for sales tax or shipping. We were out about $20 for the privilege of trying a cheaper Norelco razor then stepping up to their Top-Of-The-Line, most expensive razor. It \\&quot;only\\&quot; took 10 weeks to get our refund. I like my 1290 but I am left with the impression that Norelco is a little bit chintzy and doesn&#x27;t like to give refunds. I wonder what would have happened if we had not had copies of the receipts and a tracking number. I wanted to give you a heads-up about what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 13, 2013 update: I have found that while trimming my moustache, it is much easier to see if you simply turn the razor upside down. The shaving heads are no longer in the way and the view is unrestricted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 19, 2013 update: After being ill I had an 8 day growth of beard. I used the 1290 to shave it all off in about 15 minutes of shaving time. I was concerned that the long hairs would not get into the cutting heads but it worked just fine. That is a real tribute to the holes, slots and openings designed into the cutting head. There was no pulling or discomfort of any kind, just a good, clean, dry shave. The shaving heads were pretty full of whiskers when I finished but I never had to stop empty the heads during my shave. I am impressed and wanted to pass along my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 28, 2013 Update: I have two things to share in this update. First, I have been shaving dry and find it takes 6 to 8 minutes for me to shave my face and back of my neck where my hair is blocked. I get a slightly closer shave when I shave with water but the dry shave is very close and is just so fast and easy that is what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, In thinking about the discussions about battery life and charging in other posts about the 1290, I have changed the way I charge my razor. Since itis best not to let the battery go below 20% of full charge and because the basic charger in the razor never charges the battery more than about 70% of full charge, I have calculated that 22 minutes of shave time would be about the 20% level. So, I never let my razor discharge below 22 minutes. If there is not enough time left for me to shave for 8 minutes and end at or above 22 minutes, I charge my razor. It is now charging up to about 79 minutes of shave time before the charger shuts off. Discharging the razor to 6 minutes as Norelco suggests would mean taking the battery down to about a 5% charge. I don&#x27;t believe that will give you maximum battery life. I like my 1290 and want it to last as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update December 8, 2013. I have had my 1290x for about a year now and noticed that it didn&#x27;t seem to shave as closely as It did when it was new. I bought and installed a new shaving head and the shaver is back to new in how close it shaves. I have fallen into a routine of taking about six minutes to shave my face and back of my neck. I usually dry shave but will occasionally wet shave with warm water. I always rinse each head under hot water, first from the outside to the inside, then from the inside to the outside.  I charge my razor before it gets below 22 minutes and when charged it shows between 73 and 79 minutes. I still like my 1290x very much and still believe that it is giving me the closest shave I have ever gotten from any of my Norelco razors. The shave is  fast, easy, comfortable and the razor is simple to maintain.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I have tried Panasonic and Braun wet-dry shavers and neither lasted longer than two years. Wet electric shaving is especially hard on an electric shaver. Wet shaving with creams and foams is even tougher on the shaver. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to clean the gunk they cause out of the heads/blades. So if you like to use an electric shaver wet, count on replacing heads and possibly replacing shavers more often. Having said all of that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco shaved closer and more comfortably for me than either the Braun or the Panasonic. It also held a charge longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after only 11 months, it just plain quit. It made horrible noises, spun around once or twice, and then became a brick. I would have written a nasty review at that point. But I called Philips Norelco, gave them the serial number, and they sent me a completely new shaver via FedEx. This level of customer service was a really great surprise. That was the good news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news came when I decided to pick up a spare head/blades. They are nearly impossible to find and selling for about $140. That is an absurd yearly maintenance cost. Anybody considering this shaver should keep this in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given up on &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shaving with electrics entirely. now I only use it &amp;#34;dry,&amp;#34; when I don&#x27;t have time for my old school double edge safety razor. For dry shaving and convenience, this shaver is about as good as they get.</li>
    <li> This is not my first Norelco electric razor, I have had low end models and higher end models.&lt;br /&gt;pros are:&lt;br /&gt;No cords&lt;br /&gt;quick recharge&lt;br /&gt;good shave&lt;br /&gt;easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;takes a bit longer to get a close shave than my other Norelco&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;tricky to get along beard line, but doable after trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for a travel razor or that does not like to shave with a blade, you can get a fairly close shave with this unit, after a few more uses maybe I will be able to get even closer as my other took a few months of use to adjust.(it&#x27;s been a while since I have used an electric razor)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a year. I originally got 60 plus minutes after a recharge. Nine months later it won&#x27;t charge higher than 42 minutes.  The replacement blades are outrageously priced. My Braun replaces blades every 18 months, Norelco is 12 months.</li>
    <li> I will keep it short. I am a big freak of good shave every morning and will go to any length to get one. I have been using Gillette Power Fusion before purchasing this electric shaver. Always wanted to use  electric shaver but was not sure of result. So gave it a try after reading reviews and purchased 1250. My views -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Its a great product BUT give your skin some time to get used to it. You may have discomfort, irritation, rashes initially (as many other reviews too have suggested and as manual too says) but trick is to keep using and it will ll go as your skin gets used to it. Mine took about 4 days but it could be upto 2 weeks. I know many who used it for a day or so and then went back to old manual razor. Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Once you are used to it (I use wet with gel), you will love it. I enjoy my daily shave more than I use to before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Go for it. Highly recommended and worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source - Experience of using product for 2 months now (first time on electric shaver) and loving it.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this top-of-the-line Norelco is the best electric razor I have owned or used.  It shaves almost as close as a blade and closer than foil shavers I&#x27;ve owned.  It&#x27;s much quieter than any other electric on the market.  It&#x27;s got the high capacity battery which will deliver in excess of 60 minutes of shaving time.  From a convenience standpoint, I can shave in 2 minutes rather than 10 minutes with a blade...and no cuts.  Recharge time is less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;I like the LCD display...it&#x27;s much more informative than LED lights.  I&#x27;m old school when it comes to cleaning the razor...no running water for me.  I use a soft bristle toothbrush.  Every couple of months, I disassemble the blades and head and give it a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;My past Norelcos have lasted 7-8 years.  I have no reason to believe this one will not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this model to anyone looking for the best.</li>
    <li> High ratio of performance to price, The quality is very good,It is just what I need,I like it very much.</li>
    <li> love best one yet totally would advise if ur thinking about to get it i love it shave every day with it</li>
    <li> You have to take the charger AND stand with you on a long trip since the charger won&#x27;t plug into the razor, only the stand.  Really?  What a stupid design,</li>
    <li> I tried all of the &amp;#34;inexpensive&amp;#34; razors.  They don&#x27;t work and pull my hair as they shave.&lt;br /&gt;This razor works great wet or dry!! Highly recommended !!!</li>
    <li> Best shave that I have ever had.  If you wash it in water, you must use the razor lubrication by Norelco or Remington.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS SHAVER FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS ...LIKE IT VERY MUCH . LOT CLEANER SHAVE THEN PANISONIC S</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco Spectra 8881XL for well over 13 years. Replaced the heads many times which really goes without saying, replaced the batteries 3 times, and it has served me well. It does still work, but I wanted to upgrade just in case, given the age and wear and tear, it would decide to quit. I read all the reviews as I usually do and take into consideration everyone&#x27;s face is different, decided to purchase this razor. I cannot complain about anything. The first thing I noticed after fully charging it and turning it on was it was so quiet compared to the Norelco Spectra I was not sure if something was wrong or it was that different. I began shaving and upon completion...what a difference. NOTE : I am comparing the Norelco Spectra 8881XL with a new set of heads and a full charge to shaving the next day with the just received Norelco 1290X out of the box. My Spectra 8881XL has relatively new batteries, so I think it&#x27;s a fair comparison.</li>
    <li> My dad loves it. I brought for my dad as the father&#x27;s day gift. The first day he used it, he shaved three times. lol. I think he definitely enjoy holding this razor in his hands. Thank you !</li>
    <li> This is certainly the most money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a shaver! Over the years I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco&#x27;s and several Brauns. This one is the best of the lot. Overall, it&#x27;s a very good unit but it&#x27;s not flawless. Many people have asserted that you cannot leave the shaver in it&#x27;s charging cradle without damage to the battery. I&#x27;ve been leaving it there for 2 months with no ill effects so far. I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;  -- Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any electric, bar none&lt;br /&gt;  -- Works in the shower which is actually more useful than I&#x27;d imagined&lt;br /&gt;  -- Looks great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;  -- You have to open the heads and rinse them out every day for optimal performance&lt;br /&gt;  -- The charging stand is not well made. The shaver often fails to make proper contact with the charging electrodes.&lt;br /&gt;  It needs quite a bit of fiddling to get it just right. And then sometimes I&#x27;ve come home and it&#x27;s just beeping/flashing&lt;br /&gt;  because it really wasn&#x27;t set properly in the stand.&lt;br /&gt;  -- The trimmer is truly awkward. It works but it&#x27;s not a good design.</li>
    <li> Been a Noralco user for over 30 years. This latest purchase is a great shave. Easy to keep heads clean. The 60 minute run time on a charge works well for trips.</li>
    <li> love it very much! but I can not turn it on!</li>
    <li> Travel case doesn&#x27;t fit the charger or the instruction booklet.</li>
    <li> Close, close shave.  Easy to hold.  I wish the charger system was a little less cumbersome. Charger is bulky to carry on a trip. Has a stand and cord but you can&#x27;t shave while the unit is charging.  Otherwise, this shaver is the best Norelco I have owned. I have used Norelco shavers since 1968.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I sent it as a gift to one of my friend, and the others all like it. So, I will purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Good product, I used it for 6 month already</li>
    <li> REally like this razor.  It is quiet, has a long battery life, and shaves well.  It met my expectations across the board.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about six months ago to replace my Braun series 7 which I had for about six years - I just got tired of buying cleaning fluid for it. While I thought the Braun provided a good close shave, the Norelco is even better. It is also lighter and significantly easier to hold while shaving. The Braun gave me a razor burn just below my nose; the Norelco doesn&#x27;t, even after months of usage. Cleaning is simple and easy, a great close shave, a trimmer: this is about as good as an electric razor can get. I simply love it and have no hesitation in recommending it.</li>
    <li> I was a Norelco user for many, many years.  I&#x27;d been using midrange Norelco electric razors and after my second one died after 7 or 8 years I decided I was tired of the feeling they caused of ripping the hair out of my face and decided to try a foil razor.  I picked up a top-of-the-line Braun and was initially pretty pleased -- no pain, and a fairly close shave.  But over time I came to realize that &amp;#34;fairly close&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t really all that close and that it was taking me twice as long to shave because I was struggling to get around the jawline and under the nose.  Not to mention complaints from the wife about hairs getting everywhere since the foil razors shoot hair everywhere.  So after a few years of that I decided to go back to Norelco, but spent the money for their best.  That turned out to be a great decision.  This razor makes quick work of the cheeks and the neck and has enough flex to make the jawline, chin, etc. less of a chore.  It also provides the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten from an electric and without pain.  The ripping sensation I got from older, cheaper Norelco razors is gone, and of course it stores 90% of the clippings so that you can dispose of them in ways that don&#x27;t anger the spouse.  The icing on the cake is that this razor is VERY quiet, especially compared to the Braun it replaced.  Still not crazy about the price, but it&#x27;s hard to say it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> The shaver went off at The first time i used and never start again, i cant believe it that philips sold something With that quality</li>
    <li> Well I almost returned it as it doesn&#x27;t have a travel lock.  Figured the &amp;#34;auto&amp;#34; lock would work but went on a trip without the charger and was horribly wrong.  Very frustrating.  Other than that though it is indeed a really nice shaver and I can shave in only a few minutes to smooth perfection.  Very nice so I&#x27;ll keep it despite the stupidity of needing a cradle to charge and no travel lock.</li>
    <li> I just bought the Norelco 1290x razor.  I will adjust my stars after a few months of use.  I wanted to give some advice on how to buy this at a discount during the holiday season.  I bought the razor at Bed, Bath and Beyond.  I used a 20% off coupon which brought the price down to $200.  I then used the $20 coupon downloaded from the Philips Norelco web site.  That brought the price down to $180.  After tax, the item was still less than $190.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norleco has a rebate currently going on with Bed, Bath and Beyond.  I was given a rebate sheet and receipt at checkout to send in.  It is for $30.  So, the total price of the Norelco 1290x is $150 plus tax.</li>
    <li> A long time Braun customer and the latest offering from them was very disappointing.  I have never tried a rotary before so this was a big leap of faith and the quest to be without shaving cream was a driving force.  I have found the shaver to be very well built.  The battery lasts over 10 days so far and Im very pleased.  Easy to clean and now chemicals needed which is always a plus.  The closeness in the shave has been as advertised and I also appreciated the Videos on the product at the company main website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An easy 5 Stars</li>
    <li> This razor performs better than expected, in closeness and comfort while working in every part of my face.  The unusual design of the shaving head allows it to get into recesses around ears and nose with no interference from the body of the shaver.  The placement of the trimmer makes perfect sense the first time you turn the shaver around to use it on sideburns.  The shaving-time reminder displayed on the side of the razor is very handy when traveling or doing a touch up at the office.  Every battery-powered razor should have this feature to let the user know if the charge is sufficient to get another shaving cycle from it.</li>
    <li> OK, though not as good after a month of use (like all electrics).</li>
    <li> Gave to my husband as a gift, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is a very poorly designed razor so it is frustrating that it provides a good shave.  This razor does not have a travel lock - some web sites and company literature say it has an \\&quot;auto travel lock\\&quot; but don&#x27;t believe it.  Lights around the power button turn on every time the razor is moved so I can only imagine that the battery will be entirely or significantly drained during travel.  And to make matters worse, charging the razor requires connecting to a flimsy plastic stand that does not fit in the travel case and is likely to break when packed.    There are so many versions of this razor that even the company&#x27;s staff is unable to understand the products and correctly answer questions.  A Philips phone rep told me that the razor was broken and sent me a new one in response to my question about the light that appears when the unit is moved.  The new razor behaved the same way.  Another rep told me that the light meant the razor needed to be charged - even though it was fully charged.  Company reps had an equally hard time figuring out if the 1290 had a travel lock - especially since less expensive models have it.    That said, the shave is excellent which is why my experience is so frustrating.  There are way too many versions and different combinations of features - this is the only electronics product I have every purchased where trading up does not mean getting the previous model&#x27;s features plus, trading up with these razors often means paying more for less.  Buying a high-end razor should not mean sacrificing a travel lock a product that is not at all travel friendly (because it requires you to pack a flimsy stand - or liquid carrying cleaning apparatus for other models - to be able to recharge while traveling).</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift.  Recipient has nothing but great comments to say about it.  Much better than past Norelco razors.</li>
    <li> The 1290X is the Mercedes of the 3D Norelco&#x27;s and worth every penny. The design and quality looks as if it belongs on display. I was amazed at the fit and finish of the rasor itself which is first class all the way. Norelco is creating some amazing products. The 1290X is one of their top of the line Razors and why the quality of the casing itself is so high. The other models may not have such a high end feel to them in your hand but I am sure they shave just as amazing.</li>
    <li> The shaver seems to run at a slower speed than most...which would explain why it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I expected...</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for my whole life, since 1974 and this is the best yet. It replaces an Arcitec which was very disappointing. Although the ergonomics of the 1290X are similar to the Arcitec, the heads have been re-engineered the head assembly is deeper and more substantial and the unit feels much better in the hand - a well made piece of equipment. I think you will enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1290X&#x27;s water resistance means I clean it with the brush and then rinse it under water - no separate dodgy cleaning machine and no expensive fluid. I use the 1290X with Art of Shaving pre-shave and do not feel a need to use a gel or shaving cream. My face is noticeably smoother than with the Arcitec or any of my older units. It is important to shave with a circular motion for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only salient criticism is the fiddly charging stand. I think they tried to balance the need for portability with the need for stability and failed on both counts. In home use the charging stand seems a bit flimsy, especially when compared to the solidity and weight of the 1290X itself. The stand also is a bit cumbersome for traveling - although you should get at least a week of shaves out of a full charge so you can leave the stand/charger at home for most business trips. The travel case is not the advertised &amp;#34;deluxe&amp;#34; but quite ordinary. I would hope that the next version of this product is unchanged as to the razor itself but includes a more solid charging stand and a better travel solution - something like the hard shell I got with the Arcitec would be a step in the right direction.</li>
    <li> i have used norelco and i want to clean norelco. so, i checked package of norelco. the time, i could catch that this norelco isn&#x27;t 1290x but 1280xcc... oh my god!! i have used 1280xcc crazy....</li>
    <li> this shaver has changed my life....i was a guy who shaved every 10 days,with a blade,because of rash,now with the 3d i shave 2 times a day,everyone says&#x27;&#x27;wow i look so young and fresh&#x27;&#x27;,and my gf loves my new face,lets &#x27;&#x27;face it&#x27;&#x27;  haha ,who wants to kiss a guy with face hair? well mabey freddy mercury.lol....</li>
    <li> next best shave to a razor blade.  and do not cut myself.  very comfortable to handle.  i use with shaving cream and like the wet shave</li>
    <li> nice，Very good, very easy to use。The metal body was very atmospheric。High tech razor, very good。a b c d e f</li>
    <li> very nice shaver.......</li>
    <li> takes a couple of weeks for your skin to adjust, although i really have never shaved regularly. now it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, no irritation</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for over 30 years. In the past, the razors always left a few hairs un-cut. Therefore I had to use a safety razor 3-4 days a week to get all the little hairs left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this razor two months ago. There are no little hairs left behind! I have not used my old safety razor to get any stray hairs left behind by this 1290x Norelco razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the razor for 6 weeks before the full charge of 60-minutes ran down to 10-minutes (when I decided to plug it in to charge the battery). So it only needs charging about 6 times a year. Great for traveling knowing it will last over 6 weeks so I do not have to bring the charging stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use the razor as a dry shave. Just for fun I decided to try shaving in the shower. I did not notice any improvement in the shaving, to me it felt about the same as with a dry shave. Only drawback is the razor heads must be left open for several hours to throughly dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not real clear on the difference between the 2D and the 3D razor. I do love my 3D razor and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought my 1290x razor used on eBay for only $90. The seller said it was only used 3-4 times before selling the razor. Do not know why it was being sold, it looked brand new when I got it. I love this razor so much that I would be willing to pay the full Amazon price for a new razor.</li>
    <li> I have the same Philips Norelco shaver and they are thee greatest shaver since the straight razor. A GREAT PRODUCT FOR MEN. PERFECT.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever owned, it shaves closer than a blade razor. It is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The 1290X/40 looks quite impressive. It comes with a charging station, power cord, brush, pouch, instructions, and a plastic head cap. Unlike the old plug and go corded shavers, users really need to sit down and read the instructions. Like my older Norelco 1150 it has a great ergonomic feel. Weight balance is above average from the previous models that I&#x27;ve owned. After charging up for a little over an hour, it was time for the big test.</li>
    <li> I choose Norelco because I had a cheaper one for 7 years and it always worked great. Assumed this new fancy one would be improved but it is not.  After getting it and finding out that once the battery would not recharge, it was done. you can&#x27;t plug it in and use it.  The quality of the shave just isn&#x27;t there.  Five oclock shadow appears at noon and it is harder to clean than that older models.&lt;br /&gt;  you can buy 4 of the basic norelcos for the price of this one and be a lot happier</li>
    <li> Good feeling when he Shaving. It&#x27;s 219 dollars ,i think it will be cheap when the 3.8 come on ....</li>
    <li> This razor is a big change from my top-of-the-line Braun.  I like that it is waterproof so that I can rinse it clean.  The Braun required purchasing special cleaning supplies constantly.  The best thing is that it shaves well and does so at barely a whisper.  My Braun sounded like a B-29 taking off.  The shave is close and comfortable.  The cons for this razor are its lack of ability to be charged directly from the power cord (must use the charging stand) - a negative for constant travelers, like me and it doesn&#x27;t have a travel lock.  So far, keeping the razor in its case, I have not had it turn on in my luggage, so maybe the lack of travel-lock isn&#x27;t such a big deal.  I like this razor so far and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun 760cc since 2009, and it smoothe and close shave.  The trimmer part on my braun did not want to stay closed, and charger/cleaning station is only working when it feelt like it.  I needed a new shaver.  I have been reading lots of reviews, and decided to got with Philips Norelco 1290.  As it was mentioned before me, shaver is great and smooth.  Let me tell you why I chose Norelco over Braun this time.  Norelco is quieter...way way way quieter over Braun, no need to buy cleaning solutions, option of wet/dry shaving available (have not tried wet shave yet, so will not comment on that), looks better on the bathroom vanity, takes less space.  Braun razor gets hot during shaving and leaves red marks on your face, Norelco is not.  Over all I gave 4 star review for my Braun 7 series in 2010, and still till this day I think at $200 is overpriced.  So far Norelco is a winner between two of them at my opinion.</li>
    <li> Not bad moter seams just a little weak.even after full charge.any one eles have this issue with it!</li>
    <li> This product has changed shaving for me. I have used several electric and straight blade configurations and brands. I used to absolutely dread having to shave and it always messed up my face while still leaving me feeling rough. This razor makes shaving quick and after the adjustment period it was also painless. Out of all of the solutions I have tried this one left my face and neck feeling the best with no sensitivity issues. This combined with C.O. Bigelow shave foam leave&#x27;s me with an amazing feeling face thats nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Braun electric shave user for about 10 years and decided to see if all the positive reviews I&#x27;ve read are legit. Well, after purchasing a new open box item for $180 on the auction site I&#x27;ve been breaking this puppy in for 3 weeks, using it every other time I shave while still using the Braun 7 Series half the time. The first thing I was struck with was how quiet the Norelco is compared with the Braun. The second and most important factor in choosing an electric razor is how it conforms to your facial curves especially around the jawbone. Again the Norelco is superior to the Braun. Oh, did I mention fewer strokes are needed so less time and effort achieving a close shave. The pop up trimmer does a good job getting those annoying nose and ear hair areas as well. I decided against the cleaning system as all you need to do is rinse under warm or hot water when the faucet symbol shows up on the display. This saves a bunch as my Braun requires a new cleaning solution every 2 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to mention that my face didn&#x27;t require any time at all getting used to the shaver and was smooth without irritation after the first time shaving, perhaps due to the fact I&#x27;ve been using an electric for years.</li>
    <li> Very high tech, only used once, feeling pretty good, but it seems not imagined so clean shaving</li>
    <li> Husband loves this shaver but the replacement heads are very expensive.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver, really gets everything and leaves your face smooth.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Feel well when shaving. I&#x27;d like to recommend this type of shaver to my friends. I also save a lot than buy it at other local store.</li>
    <li> Though I have purchased four other electric razors, this is by far the smoothest and quietest of all.  In addition, its quickness in recharging is another outstanding feature and it holds the charge long beyond other razors.</li>
    <li> does not worth of its money.........  130-150$ maximum............</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and have had time to try it out in order to get a real-time feel for function and performance.  To begin with, it is significantly over priced and has a much reduced battery capacity compared to its predecessor.  Have used a number of Norelco rotary razors and find they have a common draw-back; do not perform well in tight places (upper lip, for example).  On the plus side, this razor is very nearly a work of art...beautiful to behold.  Also very quiet, a feature I definitely appreciate.  I probably will not purchase another rotary razor, as the foil type has a number of advantages to offer, ie: closer shave with less effort for example.</li>
    <li> Meets or exceeds my expectations top this point.  It gives a better shave than my previous Norelco.  The price is high though.</li>
    <li> So when you look at spending this much on a electric razor you expect it to perform incredibly well in everyday and look good doing it!&lt;br /&gt;This razor does not disappoint! with a incredible battery life, closest shave I have experienced from an electric, and a stylish look this razor continues to impress.</li>
    <li> Very good shaving compared to the previous machine I had.</li>
    <li> Been using it a year now and still going strong.</li>
    <li> This is very useful for me, I am very like it. Bought not regret，do not miss it.come on let&#x27;s buy it</li>
    <li> The razor will work fine, and you will be pleased, UNTIL tha battery dies. When this happens (always after the warranty), you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE THE RECHARGABLE BATTERY. They make it virtually impossible to open, don&#x27;t give any discription of it&#x27;s power or type, and must be broken from the soldered one, and the new one resoldered in. Repair places are far and few between, and even if you do find one, it&#x27;s almost as much to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; as purchasinga new unit. Phillips does this on their Sonic toothbrushes as well, so just devide your cost of so many uses by the cost of the unit and you will find it an extremely overpriced way to shave. The whole razor is dependent on the battery, which is worth about $18. How do they manage to get away with this, without even a label on the package telling people that batteries aren&#x27;t really replaceable amazes me.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor, fast, nice great only way to complain is the little heads have to be emptied every day or two insteand of holding like a months worth of shaving.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco rotary razors for more years than I can remember and this is the best one yet. Gives a close comfortable shave in very little time. Only drawback is that it has to be recharged in the stand and must be disconnected from power within 60 minutes of being charged.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the design is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the feel is so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;charger is easier to use .</li>
    <li> Due to very sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver since my early 20&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve had many units over the years from  Bruan to Panasonic. I&#x27;ve found that the Norelco seems to give the best shave of all the brands I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve had a few of their top of the line razors. This one here the 1290X is the best. Saves real close, better then anything I&#x27;ve used so far. Love it. Haven&#x27;t tired with shaving cream yet, that might be a good experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who use blades, you will never get a shave as close as that with an electric . Electric shavers are excellent for people like me (I can&#x27;t use a blade everyday would ruin my skin). I can use a blade once in a while and i save those days for special occasions when I want a awesome shave. But for everyday shaving to look clean and presentable - electric&#x27;s work great. Also, they will save you a ton of money, and they are very convenient. Even if I could use a blade everyday, I still would own this electric shaver - it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Phillips Norelco doesn&#x27;t stop the amazing products they make, expensive but worth it! Did I say expensive? Keep it up.</li>
    <li> This quality than the previous 1150 looks a lot better, I was used as a new year gift, only small regret is a simple package.</li>
    <li> I bought it last month using $50 coupon.And I find the price is higher than that now.I just hope there could be deals soon so that I could buy other one.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as you would expect for the money.</li>
    <li> The razor arrived on time and in perfect condition.  On Christmas Day it was happily received and has been charged up and used much to the delight of the receipitant.  This is his second Shaver 8800 and he wanted the identical model because he was so pleased with the first one.</li>
    <li> very very good!I like it.......The shave is very smooth.The shaver itself is sleek and has a very good solid feel in my hands</li>
    <li> I am urging everyone who is looking at this right now to buy this razor. I have had  ten different razors over my lifettime and no other razor can compare to this particular model. The other razors i have had always leaves hair on the neck. Not this one. Cleans up all the hair no matter where it is on your neck. Very nice and well worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> The first one I bought did not work at all.  It was not charged and would not hold a charge.  I sent it back and got another one.  10 months later it stopped working.  It sounds like the gears are grinding against each other but the blades don&#x27;t turn.  I&#x27;ve spent an hour in chat with customer service and gotten nowhere.  On top of that I&#x27;d like to send some feedback on this experience but there&#x27;s no way to do that in written form (email).  Horrible product.  Horrible customer service.</li>
    <li> What a pleasant surprise! I&#x27;ve had a couple Norelco Razors in the past, but quit using them since they couldn&#x27;t give me as close a shave as a blade. I read the reviews on this and decided to give it a try ( the $50 discount helped with my decision). So glad I did. It shaves just as close as the Fusion and with less hassle. Also, it can be cleaned with water. No need to buy extra cleaning products.My only concern at this point is: how long do the blades last before needing to be replaced? At $50 per, it could get quite expensive. Only time will tell. For now, extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This razor is great thus far, but only time will tell.  I paid a little more then twice what I&#x27;ve paid for these in the past.  But so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco user for over 40  years.  I generally buy their top shaver on the market.  I purchased the 1290x and it gives me the best shave of all time.  Previous shavers had trouble with my neck - but not this one.  I get the closest and fastest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with the 1290X.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I love it but the charge goes down and does not fully charge after owning it a while it will only charge p to 44% and not 100% whats up with that</li>
    <li> this shaver is the best around , I have looked at many and this is the best shaver I have had</li>
    <li> My Norelco lived for 20 days!!!!!!!!!!! It was so fast that Amazon gave me \\&quot;a no questions ask-full refund\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m so disappointed. What Philips is doing here is a major costumer law infraction. If you read other reviews you will find that this is a common problem: the batteries are dying between 1 to 12 months of the purchase. It looks like the only way to prevent (no guarantee!) this is by keeping the Norelco out of the charger stand once it is fully charged. And, what is more important: instructions (manual) says otherwise!!!! In my case I bought the 1250 with the Cleaning system... I don&#x27;t recommend this machine...</li>
    <li> I like it very much, reliable brand and new high-tech element perfect confluence is together, bearded man you worth having</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shave. The unit I got only was good for 1 shave before it got hung up somehow and wouldn&#x27;t turn on but Norelco promptly sent me replacement handle which works. The charging part of the system is a bit less compact than my previous shaver so that&#x27;s a slight minus but this is mitigated by the fact the unit will hold a charge for 30 shaves so the charger would only be needed for a really long trip.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for a gift and he loves loves loves it.  It&#x27;s super quiet and shaves so smoothly&lt;br /&gt;.  He says he will never use a razor again.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for years, most recently with the cleaning system.  I love the efficiency, comfort, and speed enabled by these razors.  Recently, I put a new head on my three-year old 1280X, with fresh cutters, coils,  etc., for my son, going away to school and needing something at the last minute.  I then bought a new 1290x that arrived a few days after he left.  This one is compatible with the same cleaning system as the 1280x, but has an all-metal body instead of part plastic and chrome.  It looks the same, but it is just a bit heavier.  I do not know what improvements they have made, but I like it even more!  This seems to cut closer than ever, with the same complete comfort and ease.  I tip my hat to Philips Norelco for another excellent job!</li>
    <li> The razor provides a very good shave for an electric razor. It replaced a lower series Philips Norelco model. The surface area of the cutters are larger and thinner than my old model.</li>
    <li> I found the Philips Norelco 1290X/46 shaver gives a super shave, that is close and leaves the skin smooth.  However, I find the replacement blade head very expensive, especially if you replace it annually.</li>
    <li> Whenever a new Philips razor comes out I am first in line. They have all been good, but this one is great. It shaves smooth, close and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling that I just rubbed sandpaper over it.</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed my Norelco, but this model is the best one yet. It heads follow the contours of my face, and I can use shaving cream to help enhance my experience. I love this razor. Great product.</li>
    <li> BEWARE buying these, I purcsed two. The first one charged but would not turn on after full charge, The second one wouldn&#x27;t even charge, it was DOA. These are the worst I have ever seen Norelco attempt to sell.....STAY AWAY from these.....</li>
    <li> Posssibly my comments are not typical, as I have not had an electric razor in 50 years. In my every day usage it has outperformed my expectations in the quality of the saves and the ease of upkeep of the razor.</li>
    <li> Shaver gives a very good, close shave with minimal irritation.  Trimmer is very good.  It&#x27;s only drawback is that the triple head is so larger that it is difficult to get a good shave on your upper lip</li>
    <li> Holds a charge a long time.  Reliable and effective.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with disposable razors for about 29 years and have recently decided to try an electric shaver. This one is quiet, gentle on my face, and it provides a close shave. I would like to use it every day, but my face can&#x27;t handle frequent shaving with a disposable razor or electric shaver. I like everything about the shaver but after the first or second use, I noticed that I am having the same post shave irritation and discomfort as I have always had with razors. The shaver is not the problem, it is just my skin type.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor out there. I know it has been for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for a birthday gift, and it is really loved. It adjusts to the&lt;br /&gt;individual face, and the best shave ever! So glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> The senso touch 1290 seemed like a good choice when I purchased it but when it arrived it did not charge or power up at all so I sent back for a replacement and amazon did a very good job at replacing it but when the second one arrive I noticed that some functions did not work like the power lock button so the razor doesn&#x27;t power up by mistake in your bag. It&#x27;s big, bulky, expensive and it does not charge unless you have it on the cradle ( you cannot connect the power cable to the razor itself ). On a good note the battery has a good life span and it charges pretty fast.</li>
    <li> This Norelco razor replaces an another model of Norelco razor.  They make a fantastic razor, why would I ever go anywhere else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design on this model is a bit better than my last one.  The head and its three cutting surfaces float and pivot smoothly over my face.  My other razor&#x27;s cutting heads were solid mounted, so they did not flex and adjust to my face, I had to adjust my hand position.  This razor has a much better feel to the grip.  It is obvious that a lot of thought went into its design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the razor is just slightly harder, by slightly harder I mean I used to have to open one large cover, now I open three individual covers.  Not really a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature not related to the great shave I get with this razor is the display of battery time left.  When I turn it on each morning it shows my how many minutes of use remain.  My old razor would just slow down a bit, meaning I could get through this shave, but then need to charge it.  When I traveled it forced me to bring the charger in case it ran out of power while I was away.  Now I can just look at the battery monitor and know if I need to charge it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great razor and I assume, based on my previous history with Norelco, that it will last me for a long time and serve me well each day.</li>
    <li> Warning: Original Shaving head discontinued    I have used Norelco shavers for over 35 yrs. I purchased this shaver (1290x/46) and have used it for 2 years. It was the best shaver that I have ever used. HOWEVER... Norelco has replaced the original shaving head (RQ12) for this model. The new style shaving head (RQ12 +) is inferior to the original shaving head and it appears to be of cheaper quality. It does not operate as a 3D system but is more of a 2D system. The new shaving head does not give as smooth of a shave as the original and is harder to clean than the original. Too bad Norelco messed up an excellent shaver.</li>
    <li> Researched it Love it very quiet operation</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a Christmas gift for my husband. Nearly 6 months later and he still loves it. From my perspective, it keeps him kissable!</li>
    <li> Loved the razor, until almost a year to the day I replaced the blades, and about two weeks later it stopped working,</li>
    <li> I had terrible time shaving above my neck / below chin area. It does a goood job on the sides of face. and chin. Due to poor performance in few places i had to do multiple passes and it irritated the skin. It would leave too many patches out and it was a nightmare to get clean shave. I even had to use razor for final touches. Considering many positive reviews i think maybe it suites few skin /hair types but not all. Wet performance is bad compared to dry performance. I tried to read manuals and watched youtube videos to see how to correctly use the product but no luck. Returned in 28 days. Refund is still being processed by amazon. Got the panasonic lv61 which seems better so far though it is too early to comment. It is a hit or miss i believe and for me it was a miss</li>
    <li> Gives me a smooth shave, but will never replace a blade for closeness of shave.....but I knew this when I bought it.  I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Lack that the head edge  is not dismental.</li>
    <li> smooth and painless. ihave sensitive skin and shaving has always been a pain. would recommend but expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my great guy who has ALS and is having difficulty shaving.  So far this if working good for him as he is able to get into the tighter areas that were difficult before.  He is really pleased with this razor</li>
    <li> Love it!!  Great job!!</li>
    <li> I like this electric razor. it is smooth. There is only a trimmer what is not sharp. I don&#x27;t understand all manufactures make a new products why they make one missing part. It is not honest business.</li>
    <li> The unit shaves quite closely. But the fact that the recharging cord plugs into the base rather than the shaver body itself takes points away from the rating. Also, the 60 minute battery in it is a pale shade of my old &amp;#34;James Bond&amp;#34; model Norelco from a decade ago which still had a fully functional two hour battery at the point where I lost it in a business trip.</li>
    <li> Because of my carelessness, I didn&#x27;t find that there is no cleaning base in the packet until I receive the item,by contrast, the1280, which was inferior to 1290, is equipped with a cleaning base. In addition, commodity price cut too fast, only one month after my purchase, the price decrease forty dollars. In all, this is not a very pleasant shopping</li>
    <li> I recommend this razor to everyone.  It gives me a perfectly smooth shave in 4 to 5 minutes and it&#x27;s easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco shaver user for three decades, and never use blades with shaving cream. I have not used any other electric shavers for good reason -- Norelco makes a good shaver! So looking to replace/upgrade my current shaver [9160 XL] I did my homework on the Sensotouch 3D shavers before purchasing this one. I have been shaving with it now for over a week and I noted a huge difference in the closeness of the shave. For my experience, it isn&#x27;t just the flat part of the face that it shaves close on, but also the chin and neck area which has always been a tough area to shave close. It is easy to hold, very quiet, and the blades indeed seem to hug the curves of the face much better than any previous Norelco which I have owned. I opted to not purchase the Jet Clean system [although both shavers were similarly priced], because I just don&#x27;t have room for it in my bathroom. However, I really don&#x27;t see the need for it either, since the heads all easily fold open for rinsing after each shave. This is a great shaver with improvements over the past Norelco shavers which I have owned. The only drawback is it&#x27;s price! However, even with that said I don&#x27;t have any regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been an electric shaver user [and especially Norelco], you will agree that this one is tops. I had a difficult time getting some true feedback in my research because many are attempting to compare it to blades, or have not been regular electric shaver users. Yes, if you are switching from blades to an electric, you must \\&quot;break in\\&quot; your face to the new shaver, as it can cause some \\&quot;burn\\&quot; or chapping. Such is merely a transition, and not something which regular users will continue to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My summary? A great Norelco shaver with a shave better than all the previous models which I have used!</li>
    <li> Too expensive and it&#x27;s not worth it. You can get better results with a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you let your beard grow a little bit (over 5 mm) this thing is practically useless, you are going to be in the bathroom for 20 minutes and after that, there&#x27;s a good chance that you are going to have some skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Great razor-very easy to use and works very well</li>
    <li> This couldn&#x27;t be much better really. Awesome all around.</li>
    <li> A anniversary gift for my husband, and he loved it. If discount points the better</li>
    <li> Newer is not always better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did something completely unfair and compared my Philips/Norelco 1290X to my ten year old Norelco 8894XL, and the old shaver is better by almost every single measurement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one area where the 1290X is slightly superior is the cutting heads. While the difference does not feel significant, the 1290X gives a slightly smoother cut, but doesn&#x27;t cut individual whiskers any faster than the heads on my 8894XL, which themselves are at least four years old. The downside is that a new set of heads on the 1290X costs twice as much as the 8894XL heads cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to know where to start critiquing this product, since there are so many issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver was clearly designed to be sold to the eyes, not to be used in the hand. It looks shiny, has chrome, fancy lighting, and other looks-cool garbage design all over it, but my hands and face tell me everything about this tool is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is less than half of my ten year old shaver as it is today. That&#x27;s pathetic. I discovered this because I do a lot of travel and didn&#x27;t feel like taking the large charging base along with me. That turned out to be a mistake, as the 1290X&#x27;s battery capacity is just terrible in comparison to my ten year old 8894XL. I decided to do a real-world longevity test and let them both run down while working at my computer. The 1290X lasted about as advertised; approximately 50 minutes, but my TEN YEAR OLD 8894XL still had not quite died after I shut it off nearly two hours later. I was shocked at how long the old shaver lasted, but that explains why I seem to go so long when traveling without a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer tool is smaller, is less powerful/effective, is very loud when cutting, narrower, and is positioned in an inconvenient way. Additionally, the deployment slide is more difficult to use than older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new shaver requires it&#x27;s base stand to charge, which takes up valuablespace in my travel bag and sink surface area. You can&#x27;t plug it directly into the charging cable like my old Norelco shavers. Additionally, there are two metal posts protruding from the sides of the shaver which are the charging electrical contacts. These two metal posts stick out quite far and are uncomfortable to the fingers when holding the shaver. They are positioned directly in the locations where your fingers are likely to be supporting the shaver while in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall shape of the shaver is way too long, and for no apparent reason other than to look attractive. The long shape makes it more difficult to hold in comparison to my previous Norelco shavers. The lower portion of the shaver is pointed and long instead of rounded and short, and that makes it feel less comfortable when being held. This might seem like a pitiful gripe, but after three months of using the product and being frustrated with it&#x27;s shape every morning, I&#x27;ve come to appreciate just how badly this tool was designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire front-half of the shaver&#x27;s surface is glass-smooth, which is a poor gripping surface. I find myself constantly re-positioning my fingers upon the shaver because the device is slowly slipping within my grasp. This would not be a problem if the shape of the shaver was helpful towards it being held in the right position, but it&#x27;s long shape makes that difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button is non-tactile. You can&#x27;t find it without looking or guessing based on the overall shape of the tool. Again, the product was made to be looked at, but real world-usage wasn&#x27;t an important consideration to the design. On the up-side, there isn&#x27;t a mechanical button to wear out, since the button is a completely smooth surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, and probably most insultingly, the 1290X is $50 more expensive than my 8894XL was when I bought it in 2004.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads which cost twice as much, half the battery life, an uncomfortable body shape, requirement of the charging base when traveling, weaker trimmer, and higher cost are all indicative of an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that nobody at work, at church, or on the street it ever going to know or care how good your shiny-chrome shaver looks while it&#x27;s sitting in that charging stand at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shopping for a shaver with your eyes is a mistake; and so would be buying the 1290X.</li>
    <li> Good shave and features but I wish it had an on/off switch. The first one was returned because it would take over 20 presses to turn on or off. The second one only takes about 5 presses. Would give 5 stars for a working button and better price.</li>
    <li> 2nd razor batteries are poor</li>
    <li> The item arrived promptly, took a very quick full charge. I was able to use it immediately. I have purchased several Norelco products over the years.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s gives the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had! Thanks, Pat</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver. He likes that it gives such a very smooth shave and the battery lasts a long time without having to be recharged.  It travels well and is compact.</li>
    <li> exelent shaver,Ilove it.</li>
    <li> I have been using a 1280 version of this for the last 3 years and it worked very well.  One day I plugged it in to charge and when I came back, it was dead.  I just could not get it to do anything.  So, I did a little research and this seems to still be the preferred shaver, especially for head shaving like I do.  It turns out the old charger went bad instead of the unit itself, but I am keeping the 1290 and will have the 1280 as a backup if anything goes wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really comfortable shave, both wet and dry.  Of course it takes a little time for you skin to adjust to a new shaver, but once you get through that it is great.  This shaver seems to do really well with somewhat long hair.  I have skipped up to 3 days and it only takes slightly longer to shave than if I do it daily.  My previous foil shaver would struggle if I skipped 2 days and take at least twice as long to shave.  Once the the hair starts to get to maybe 3/8&amp;#34; or so and is starting to &amp;#34;lay down&amp;#34;, this shave will struggle to get those hairs.  A quick pass with the trimmer over the stubborn ones and then they will shave easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the shaver head replacements were not so expensive, but I think they are worth the money.</li>
    <li> I feel like this did not live up to it&#x27;s promise of a better shave, i have to press harder than i should to get a good close shave, &amp; the little trim part that comes out to be more detailed is pretty much worthless. But it has great battery life.</li>
    <li> After 10 years of using these shavers they are still the best for my dollars. Excellent product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Chose the shaver as the top Philips model and the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; here really means it. Very quiet operation, very smooth shaving, excellent build quality. Takes a lil time to get used to electric shavers (especially if switching back from razors). The most important tip is not to press hard against the skin! The softer a touch the better are results!</li>
    <li> Prolog:  To avoid being influenced by other Amazon reviews of this product, I haven&#x27;t read any since my initial survey five months ago.  So what you get here is entirely my own take on the subject based on my experiences with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving history:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began shaving 50 years ago.  I started as a safety razor man and stayed that way for most of my life.  For me, nothing beats the closeness and comfort of a blade shave.  Along the way I tried various electric razors, but always found them to be a poor substitute when it came to shaving my dark beard.  I started out with Gillette safety razors and stayed with them right up through the double-bladed Atra - which to my way of thinking was the ultimate blade shave.  I tried some of the three and four blade razors that were introduced later and generally found them to be a great practical joke on the American public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight or nine years ago I began to suffer from a condition known as Essential Tremor (ET).  The good news is that ET is neither fatal nor contagious.  Its primary effect is to make my hands tremble (in other people it can also affect the head, voice (a la Katherine Hepburn) and legs).  Thank goodness my condition is limited to my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my ET progressed I soon discovered that shaving was something of a sword fight with an unarmed opponent (my face).  As the number of nicks and cuts increased I realized I was going to have to switch to something less lethal than a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started looking at electric razors.  I approached the subject with low expectations and not a lot of enthusiasm.  And I soon encountered one of the basic quandries when selecting an electric razor - there&#x27;s really no easy (read, inexpensive) way to do comparison tests on your own face with different brands of razors.  The better razors all tend to be expensive - so buying three different razors and picking the best shave of the three was out of the question for me.  (Pardon me, sir - would you mind loaning me your electric shaver for fifteen minutes so I can see how it works on my face?  I think not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I picked a high end Norelco.  I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t tell you the exact model as that information doesn&#x27;t seem to appear anywhere on the razor.  It may have been there originally, but later wore off.  I just don&#x27;t know.  But the primary reason I selected the Norelco over the \\&quot;flat screen\\&quot; types of razors (like Braun, Remington and Panasonic) was the design of the Norelco shaving head:  trifurcated independent floating heads.  It seemed reasonable to me that you were more likely to get a close shave as the three heads adapted to the contours of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took a deep breath and bought the most expensive Norelco.  And I was pleasantly surprised.  Electric shaver technology had obviously progressed since the last time I had tried an electric shaver.  The Norelco provided a decent shave and even did a fair job of those tough to get at areas around my nose and mouth.  But it still wasn&#x27;t as good as a blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I worked out a compromise.  I developed a shaving routine that went as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of the shower I made sure my beard was as wet and soft as I could make it by splashing very warm water on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I then applied a thin film of Gillette shaving gel to my beard.&lt;br /&gt;Next I shaved with the Norelco.  NOTE:  With the model I started with, Philips DID NOT recommend you wet shave with it.  But I&#x27;m a stubborn sort and did it anyway - and I never had a problem doing so.&lt;br /&gt;After getting the best shave I could out of the Norelco, I splashed more warm water on my face and lathered up more liberally with Gillette shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;Then I shaved the broad flat areas of my fact with a Gillette Atra.  (Using the blade to shave around my nose and mouth was an invitation to disaster!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was a close, clean shave that for the most part approximated shavingentirely with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy with the result that I bought a second Norelco - the exact same model.  I kept one in my bathroom and one in my travel kit.  Life was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as we all know, entropy has a way of always raining on your parade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By rotating the two Norelco&#x27;s and taking really good care of them they lasted for years.  But in the last six months or so I realized it was time to replace the heads on both razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now came the dilemma:  should I invest in expensive replacement heads for both shavers hoping the shavers themselves would be like some perpetual-motion machines and last forever? (not)  Or should I man up and find a replacement for the two Norelcos?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did a survey of the shavers on the market - looked at the prices and read all the reviews.  I soon realized that electric razors are like religion - everyone has to find one that works for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to go with the product that I knew had already worked for me.  So I summoned my courage and bought a 1290x.  Why did I buy the 1290x over the other Norelco models?  1) all the models with the automatic or semi-automatic cleaning systems seemed to be a joke to me.  I never had a problem with popping the heads open and cleaning them - just how lazy have we gotten? These cleaning systems look like just one more thing that will break before the razor does.  2) I wanted all the whistles and bells minus the cleaning feature and the 1290x met that criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I write this review the Amazon is offering the 1290x for $249.95, which seems outrageous to me - but, hey, I&#x27;m one cheap son-of-a-gun!  With some perseverance and patience I found the 1290X at a big box retailer that had sent me a 20% off coupon.  And it just so happened Norelco was also offering a $30 rebate at the time.  So between the coupon and the rebate I was able to buy the 1290x at a much more reasonable price (I&#x27;ll let you do the math).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the 1290x for about five months now and here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The differences between the 1290x and the old Norelco razors I had been using:  the design of the floating heads had changed - which caused me some consternation at first.  On the old razors the each head was very flexible and moved independently of the other two.  On the new razor the heads were much more stiff in comparison.  But on closer examination I discovered the design of the head had been changed to separate the actual head from the body of the head.  The movement of the body of the head was stiffer, but the actual shaving head floating above the body of the head is very flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  ON MY BEARD (see more details below) the 1290x delivers an acceptable shave.  I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between the closeness of the shave of the 1290x and my older razors (allowing for the older heads).  So I wouldn&#x27;t call the changes to the design of the 1290x revolutionary, but evolutionary.  I am still following the same shaving regimen I outlined above and I am still getting a decent, injury free, shave from my new Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Based on personal experience, an amazing number of manufacturers have decided to eliminate quality control on their electronic/mechanical products and use their customers as beta testers.  They throw their products out the door without sufficient testing or quality control and wait for feedback from disgruntled customers before introducing improvements.  Shame on them!  So when I bought the Norelco I resolved to wait at least five months before declaring success.  I am happy to report my 1290x has performed flawlessly since I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  The design of the 1290x is something Steve Jobs could have loved and admired.  It is a beautifully crafted piece of precision machinery with the look of one of the monoliths from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  When I pick up that bad girl in the morning and she instantly responds tomy touch by letting me know she&#x27;s ready for me to turn her on - wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  It&#x27;s obvious Philips spent a ton on money developing the 1290x, so the mystery is - why did they stop there?  The accessories that come with the razor are a joke!  The carry case is a piece of crap.  And why, oh why, can&#x27;t Norelco come up with a charging stand that doesn&#x27;t look and work like it was designed by the Keystone Kops?  If Steve Jobs would have loved your razor, he would have ripped you a new one on the accessories!  Get serious guys!  Spend twenty extra bucks on each razor to deliver first class accessories to go with your first class razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all things considered, I have decided to buy a second 1290x - one for the bathroom and one for the travel kit.  And with a little TLC and luck, just maybe they&#x27;ll last another 8 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about my beard.  When I first stared shaving I had a coarse black beard and a five o&#x27;clock shadow that usually appeared around two o&#x27;clock regardless of how closely I shaved.  But time marches on.  Now my beard is all grey, less coarse and it&#x27;s hard to tell if I forget to shave.  So my use of the Norelco 1290x fits me and the type of beard I have today.  Would it have worked for me 50 years ago?  I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon.  I do 80% of my shopping on Amazon.  And I read reviews.  Over the years I&#x27;ve probably read thousands of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what I&#x27;ve discovered is that reviews tend to be more about the reviewer than the product being reviewed.  I&#x27;m always amazed at how a bunch of people can give five stars and raves to a product while others give the same product one star and raspberries.  I think a lot of it has to do with the range of the reviewers&#x27; experiences, their expectations going in and their particular, and often unique, requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great for me and it meets my particular needs - so it gets four stars (with one star deducted for the silly accessories.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I recommend this razor?  Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this razor again?  Yes.</li>
    <li> Shave #1: No shaving cream. Just charged it up until it was ready to go, and went for it. Skin a little irritated (as expected from switching to electric). Surprisingly close shave for an electric, even on my neck, where I was expecting the worst. The instructions tell you to use ONLY the electric for 21 days, and if you don&#x27;t like it, they will give you a refund (up to 45 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave #2: The power button was lit, but the razor would not turn on.  I tried pushing the button, holding the button down, putting it back in the charger. Finally, some combination of docking it, plugging in the dock and unplugging it again and undocking it did something. I was able to shave although I didn&#x27;t feel like the razor was going full speed (but the charge indicator showed 60 minutes of charge remaining). Once I was done shaving, it would not turn off. I went through all the crazy steps above until somehow it turned off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figuring it was just a dud unit, I returned it to amazon for replacement. Kudos to them for sending the replacement out before I had even returned the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement razor had exactly the same problem. Charges fully, power button lights up, and then nothing happens when you press it. Tried going through all the gyrations above, no go. This one is going back too, for a refund this time.</li>
    <li> I have been a happy Norelco shaver user for decades. The one I used most recently was the 7310 that I got from Amazon in 2010.This new model is by far the best I have ever used. It is extremely comfortable, and provides a very close shave. I have not tried it wet yet. I actually bought mine at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond to take advantage of a 20% off coupon, plus they had a $50 mail in rebate.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the title telling me it was standerd package, but when I got this item, it made me crazy: 1. very simply box, not color printing package. 2. I can only use it myself, as no standerd package I can not send others as a gift! It is a dispointing shopping!</li>
    <li> My son decided to send it back because it do at all as it stated.</li>
    <li> You can read all the well written detailed reviews above, but all I can say is that after a month, I really love this razor and I bet you will too!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husbnad, his first electirc razor and he couldnt be more happy with it. Charges quickly, small enough to bring to work and his face is so smooth that I cant believe it was done with an electric razor. It does take a few weeks to get used to shaving under his chin by his neck, I guess thats a sensitive area, but other than that he would absolutely recommend it to other guys looking for an electric razor. worth the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He said it is the best shaver he has ever had.  He says it glides on your skin with no pull at all and gives the closet shave he has ever had with an electric shaver.  I am happy he is happy.</li>
    <li> Leaves stubble.  If you have any grey in your whiskers, this will not cut those stiff little whiskers.  I&#x27;ve had this razor for months, tried new RQ12 blades, the new RQ12+ replacement, and the SH90 blades (which go in the RQ12+ blade holder).  The first month or so with new blades is OK - not great, but OK - but beyond that, no go. I have to pull out my ancient Speed-XL with worn HQ9 blades to shave the stubble.  The razor itself is nice (except for requiring a docking station to recharge).  I like the auto-travel lock and I did not have any of the battery issues other reviewers have described, but the blades are useless.  If this shaver had HQ9 blades and socket for the cord...THAT would be the perfect razor.</li>
    <li> Works very well. The clock on the handle is very cool. The charging stand is very convenience.</li>
    <li> I use my forfinger and middle finger between cutting heads and body of shaver, works great. I have to twist razor on neck to get a complete shave.</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best, fastest and quietest razors in the world.&lt;br /&gt;To the reviewers who said it was dead on arrival, I also thought the same thing. The razor has some sort of accelerometer that knows when you pick it up, as well as operates as a sort of lock for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;The strange part is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to know when you are depressing the start &amp;#34;location.&amp;#34; I finally pushed the spot firmly enough to almost break the case and it came on!&lt;br /&gt;You must push very firmly. I&#x27;ve gotten used to it now, at least it won&#x27;t come on in your luggage...unlike some women&#x27;s battery operated equipment.</li>
    <li> I have used various Norelco shavers for about 25 years. The 1250x/40 worked well and was easy to clean - until it stopped working after only 2 years! When the shaver did work, I think that the shave was not close enough; I was expecting it to be much closer - more like a blade and less like I shaved 12 hours ago. Anyway, when placed in the charging cradle. the shaver doesn&#x27;t charge anymore. I replaced the cradle as well as the cord to no avail - the shaver still refuses to recharge. Does anyone have any ideas regarding an easy fix? Thanks.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably close shave for an electric razor. Compares to closeness of a blade. First sample didn&#x27;t turn on or charge but amazon promptly replaced with functioning copy.</li>
    <li> Had an older model and the difference is exceptional. The 3D is unbelievable, shaves quicker and better. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This has proven to be the best shaver I have ever used.  I was a bit hesitant in buying it for the price, and thought it was going to be like the last one I bought and still burn my neck.  I could not believe how well it worked, and how quick shaving is now.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone looking for one that actually does what it says it does.</li>
