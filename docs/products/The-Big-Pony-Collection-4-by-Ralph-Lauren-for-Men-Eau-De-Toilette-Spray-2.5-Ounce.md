      <li>1 thru 4,they&#x27;re all great fragrances for guys.</li>
      <li>Definitely love the smell on my fiancé!!</li>
      <li>oh well when you do smell it it smells so amazing!</li>
      <li>Loved the smell on my boyfriend</li>
      <li>Bought it for my dad who was very pleased.</li>
      <li>One of my, and the wife&#x27;s, favorite smells!</li>
      <li>Got my product before Christmas and that made my gift even better!</li>
      <li>It came in great time and was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>Buy it and love it.</li>
      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>I personally love the way it smells on me and it lasts all day and through the evening without having to refresh it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite of the four...followed by 3.</li>
      <li>If you are a fan of Ralph Lauren or you need an office safe (or after a gym workout/shower) fragrance, add #4 to your collection.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it smells on my husband</li>
      <li>I often get reviews like \\&quot;delicious\\&quot; or \\&quot;I want to eat you.\\&quot; Great scent, but definitely on the lighter side.</li>
      <li>Not a bad fragrance - I like citrus notes.  </li>
      <li>and I hope you get a super Amazon price like I did.</li>
      <li>Great smell but not very strong</li>
      <li>You are worth it</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite scents to wear all year long because it is so clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>in my opinion Ralph has made a comeback and i was glad to have him back in my collection of colognes.</li>
      <li>Smells great doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
      <li>Great smell but does not last very long.</li>
      <li>I get straight citrus notes from beginning to end.</li>
      <li>Big Pony #4 and #1 were the first two added - probably because I am more attracted to orange and blue.  </li>
      <li>Smells clean, not to strong and last a very long time without having to shower my self with it.</li>
      <li>price value is good, or even above average.  </li>
      <li>I will add that I do like the bottle and packaging - classic Ralph Lauren design.  </li>
      <li>#4 does offer a great option for office wear - as previously noted, the fragrance sits close to the skin and longevity is below average.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this cologne</li>
      <li>If you do not fit into those categories, pass on #4 - there are better citrus based fragrances out there</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been a Polo fan for years.. until this new line was released.</li>
      <li>not sure I love it.  </li>
      <li>its not over powering and has a clean long lasting smell.this is an oldie but goodie that&#x27;s not hard to find, but not common.</li>
      <li>and it is a classy bottle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Amazon pricing on this cologne is so much cheaper than I can find locally</li>
      <li>Buy from Amazon only and you will not have to worry about whether you are getting the real RL Polo 4 cologne.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband who is a 36 year old father of one.  </li>
      <li>so when I buy, I always buy directly from Amazon due to stellar customer service.</li>
      <li>(I generally spray the cuff on each sleeve at the seam to check performance during the day..</li>
      <li>It was affordabile and last long time, you dont have to use much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these fresh little smells you want be let down,</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Ralph Lauren fragrances - at least 10 in my current collection and added all the Big Pony editions about a year ago.  </li>
      <li>#4 is a decent fragrance, but it lacks historically proven Ralph Lauren charisma, not to mention is below average in longevity and projection/sillage.  </li>

    <li> Smells great doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been a Polo fan for years.. until this new line was released. 1 thru 4,they&#x27;re all great fragrances for guys. I highly recommend these fresh little smells you want be let down,in my opinion Ralph has made a comeback and i was glad to have him back in my collection of colognes.</li>
    <li> Took a couple female friends to Macy&#x27;s to pick out a cologne and this was the winner over about 20-30 others (even classics like Acqua di Gio, etc). I often get reviews like \\&quot;delicious\\&quot; or \\&quot;I want to eat you.\\&quot; Great scent, but definitely on the lighter side. Sticking with this for the summer. Would give it 5 stars if it lasted longer though.</li>
    <li> 5 Star cologne and 5 star seller! Got my product before Christmas and that made my gift even better! Only down part is it doesn&#x27;t last all day like I would want it to but oh well when you do smell it it smells so amazing! Definitely love the smell on my fiancé!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Big Pony Collection as a Christmas gift.  It came in great time and was exactly what I ordered.  Will definitely order through here again.</li>
    <li> I get all types of compliments when I wear this cologne.  One woman said I smelled like candy.  I get grabbed and hugged all day.  This cologne is a go!  Orange specifically.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who is a 36 year old father of one.  He&#x27;s into hunting, fishing and is in the military.  He loves this scent and so do I.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells on my husband</li>
    <li> Loved the smell on my boyfriend</li>
    <li> Very good product. Smells great. Bought it for my dad who was very pleased. Will buy again along with the others in the collection of ralph laurens big pony colognes &amp; perfumes.</li>
    <li> Received as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this scent.I recommend big pony #4 for that man in your life..its not over powering and has a clean long lasting smell.this is an oldie but goodie that&#x27;s not hard to find, but not common.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of the four...followed by 3. Smells clean, not to strong and last a very long time without having to shower my self with it.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Great Service.</li>
    <li> The Amazon pricing on this cologne is so much cheaper than I can find locally I routinely buy this from Amazon as the seller. I do not trust the resellers like I do Amazon so when I buy, I always buy directly from Amazon due to stellar customer service. This product comes in the orange big polo player number 4 box and is sealed in plastic. This is one of my favorite scents to wear all year long because it is so clean and fresh.  With my body chemistry the scent smells like citrus with wood undertones.  I receive compliments all the time. Just one spray on the wrist and the neck does the trick for me. This is one of the few scents I wear that I receive compliments and inquiries about \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot; from both males and females. I personally love the way it smells on me and it lasts all day and through the evening without having to refresh it. I highly recommend this cologne and I hope you get a super Amazon price like I did. Buy from Amazon only and you will not have to worry about whether you are getting the real RL Polo 4 cologne.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Ralph Lauren fragrances - at least 10 in my current collection and added all the Big Pony editions about a year ago.  Big Pony #4 and #1 were the first two added - probably because I am more attracted to orange and blue.  #4 is a decent fragrance, but it lacks historically proven Ralph Lauren charisma, not to mention is below average in longevity and projection/sillage.  Other reviews mention &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; notes, but I get straight citrus notes from beginning to end. Not a bad fragrance - I like citrus notes.  My issue (I have plenty of issues, but let&#x27;s stick to the ones regarding the fragrance..!!), is that it lacks the &amp;#34;uumph&amp;#34; to get noticed and does not last.  I got about 4 hours from this fragrance and shortly after the initial application, #4 settled close to skin level.  Yes, I did smell the fragrance on my clothing for a longer period (I generally spray the cuff on each sleeve at the seam to check performance during the day..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the citrus basenotes, #4 is best suited for day wear and in Spring and Summer.  #4 does offer a great option for office wear - as previously noted, the fragrance sits close to the skin and longevity is below average.  I will add that I do like the bottle and packaging - classic Ralph Lauren design.  I am especially drawn to the orange bottle - I like orange and it is a classy bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price value is good, or even above average.  A check of current pricing suggests that a small bottle can be purchased for about $30 USD.  Not too shabby..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Big Pony #4 is 4 stars out of 5.  I like it, but not sure I love it.  If you are a fan of Ralph Lauren or you need an office safe (or after a gym workout/shower) fragrance, add #4 to your collection.  If you do not fit into those categories, pass on #4 - there are better citrus based fragrances out there that last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count - invest your time rather than wasting it..!!ting it..!!</li>
    <li> My friend luv this product and says he would definitely purchase it again..It was affordabile and last long time, you dont have to use much. The scent was perfect.</li>
    <li> Great smell but not very strong</li>
    <li> This is the best of the 4. I get great compliments about it. Buy it and love it. You are worth it</li>
    <li> One of my, and the wife&#x27;s, favorite smells! Long-lasting and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great smell but does not last very long.</li>
