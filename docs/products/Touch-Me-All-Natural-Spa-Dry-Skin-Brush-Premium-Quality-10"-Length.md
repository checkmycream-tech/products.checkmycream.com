      <li>Just right...</li>
      <li>Awesome scrub brush - wet or dry.</li>
      <li>I really liked this brush for dry body brushing.</li>

      <li>I am pleased with the purchase and will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>&amp; it shipped fast!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good brush, but a bit too stiff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK for this purpose, but somehow the bristles are not strong enough or perhaps not thick enough around the end of it to make it perfect.</li>
      <li>Easy to use (especially on back)&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
      <li>My skin is super soft.</li>
      <li>Be gentle with it.</li>
      <li>I have too much dairy.</li>
      <li>But I really like it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s held up, the bristles are still straight and scratchy, the handle is intact.</li>
      <li>It bends very easily and does not look like it is going to last for long.</li>
      <li>It is better than the last dry skin brush I had.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right size with a short handle and loop for hanging in the shower.</li>
      <li>I just washed it and it&#x27;s still like new.</li>
      <li>When I wash it, it dries quickly with minimal shedding.</li>
      <li>I love it and use it wet or dry.</li>
      <li>I have mild eczema, due to a food allergy</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
      <li>The bristles are really soft, the handle turned a funky color.  </li>
      <li>Not bristle came out so far.</li>
      <li>Minimal shed first wash</li>
      <li>This is a very invigorating dry skin brush.</li>
      <li>Using the first I bought in the shower and a second as a dry brush.</li>
      <li>The reason I purchased this particular dry skin brush was because the photo shows that the wrapping around the handel is brown.  </li>
      <li>The bristles themselves seem to be firm enough to do the job, but not too scratchy as long as you keep a light touch.</li>
      <li>Very stiff right from the box.</li>

<li> BUT DOES NOT LAST LONG ENOUGH, YES I WILL BUY AGAIN.!!!</li>
<li> Too rough and handle too short for what I needed</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve purchased the sry skin brush before with white/natural color wrapping, and the wrapping becomes discolored and unattractive long before the brush wears out.  </li>
<li> Dry brushing takes at least 10-15 minutes for whole body</li>
<li> I dry brush before I shower, and then when I get out I apply either coconut oil, shea butter, or whipped shea butter (mine is just coconut oil and shea blended together)</li>
<li> I like the feel and handle of this dry brush.</li>
<li> So now I brush normal without doin it too hard.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not rough and I can see the dead skin cells falling off my body.  </li>
<li> The handle could be slightly longer though to reach the back.</li>
<li> Brush is not too hard or soft.  </li>
<li> I bought this brush to use as a back brush to scrub my back as I&#x27;m finding hard to reach some areas with my arms now when I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>

    <li> 1. Comfortable handle&lt;br /&gt;2. Leaves skin feeling soft&lt;br /&gt;3. Invigorating&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy to use (especially on back)&lt;br /&gt;5. Minimal shed first wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around a great product. Would repurchase and recommend!</li>
    <li> This brush worked miracles for me and combo wit Albolene before I worked out.I luv it!! But if you brush too hard it will hurt or may give you a bruise.So now I brush normal without doin it too hard.Lesson learned...Not bristle came out so far.It still goin strong.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  It scratches your skin a really amazing way.  It looks nice with the sissle (sp?) handle and it works well.  I used it for a &amp;#34;dry brushing&amp;#34; lesson after a company yoga class we took here at PriveCo.  It was cool.</li>
    <li> Using the first I bought in the shower and a second as a dry brush.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Appreciate the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Works nicely,  feels great.  Definitely helps the body detoxify.  The handle could be slightly longer though to reach the back.</li>
    <li> Initially I found it a little bit too stiff but I did as another reviewer suggested- soaked it in boiled water for one minute.  Now I find the bristles to be just right- not too scratchy.  However it does seem to shed quite a bit.  I have only used it a few times though- I&#x27;m hopeful this will stop eventually.  This is my first experience with this type of brush.  I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush to get rid of dry skin!</li>
    <li> OMG! I love this thing! I have mild eczema, due to a food allergy so I am itchy anytime I have too much dairy. How am I supposed to give up cheese?! I use this skin brush to get a really good and satisfying itch going and it does the trick. My skin looks and feels awesome to boot. I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and it&#x27;s held up, the bristles are still straight and scratchy, the handle is intact. Good quality at a good price.</li>
    <li> could have been better quality.</li>
    <li> Just getting into dry skin brushing and haven&#x27;t been able to use it very often but it is made of very good quality. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I use it almost everyday before I get in the shower as a form of  lymphasizing.  It&#x27;s not rough and I can see the dead skin cells falling off my body.  I know that using it is making my skin and body healthier.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates super well without breaking the skin-- great for scratching dry itchy winter skin without risking wounding yourself!</li>
    <li> Some brushes are very painful and some brushes can be too soft. This one is just right!</li>
    <li> great product fast shipping thanks</li>
    <li> Great brush. It hurts so good</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use for drybrushing; and it&#x27;s perfect for that.  Although it may be too rough, if you have sensitive skin.  I am pleased with the purchase and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very stiff right from the box.Thought I will never use it.  My mom told me to put it in boiled water for minute, and it solved the problem. Just perfect for tender skin. Will by again this brush, when time to renew .Thank you.</li>
    <li> The handle is very course and not comfortable to hold. The bristles themselves seem to be firm enough to do the job, but not too scratchy as long as you keep a light touch.</li>
    <li> GREAT BUT DOES NOT LAST LONG ENOUGH, YES I WILL BUY AGAIN.!!!</li>
    <li> Worst ever.  The bristles are really soft, the handle turned a funky color.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I really liked this brush for dry body brushing. I did not experience the bristles falling off except for little flurries here and there. It exfoliates your skin really well, and you can even see the dead skin falling off without being abrasive. I just washed it and it&#x27;s still like new. Love it.</li>
    <li> I  love this brush for body scrubbing. It&#x27;s just the right size with a short handle and loop for hanging in the shower. The bristles are perfect, not too soft and not too rough.</li>
    <li> Wonderful way to get my body going.</li>
    <li> I like the feel and handle of this dry brush. Hangs from handle easily in my bathroom for quick daily access. Works great lightly or with pressure.</li>
    <li> Too rough and handle too short for what I needed</li>
    <li> Great for exfoliating your skin of toxins , pores are clean and skin is fresh !&lt;br /&gt;Especially Great for Cleaning your Back, Buttocks, Legs, Knees, elbows and Feet !&lt;br /&gt; CAUTION !!!  NO  I  DO NOT RECOMMEND  FOR FACIAL CLEANING !!!</li>
    <li> Nicely made brush - not sure if shedding is common but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush, but a bit too stiff. Be gentle with it. A plus is that it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> This is a poor quality brush. I thought this was the same quality as the one I bought from bedbath and beyond, but no. It bends very easily and does not look like it is going to last for long. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> The reason I purchased this particular dry skin brush was because the photo shows that the wrapping around the handel is brown.  I&#x27;ve purchased the sry skin brush before with white/natural color wrapping, and the wrapping becomes discolored and unattractive long before the brush wears out.  So, when I saw it was available in a darker wrapping, it seemed like the perfect solution.  To my surprise, the wrapping around the brush was white/natural color wrapping, not brown.  The brush is great, otherwise.</li>
    <li> Lurve this brush.  Works great!  Does what it is supposed to do.  Just perfect.</li>
    <li> I love it and use it wet or dry. Makes my skin feel soft. I would recommend that you try it!!</li>
    <li> Sheds everywhere but it feels really good. Bottom part of the handle scratches your hand when you use it though. I wouldn&#x27;t buy the same one again.</li>
    <li> The brush that I received sheds. When I tried to use it, little hairs and small brush particles went everywhere. I had placed my foot on the sink so I could brush my leg, and I got a little particle in my eye. The brush is now in the trash.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use as a back brush to scrub my back as I&#x27;m finding hard to reach some areas with my arms now when I&#x27;m in the shower. It&#x27;s OK for this purpose, but somehow the bristles are not strong enough or perhaps not thick enough around the end of it to make it perfect. If ever I find another brush with more bristles I will probably get it, but for the meantime this one is almost adequate for reaching the areas I want it to reach.</li>
    <li> Awesome scrub brush - wet or dry. Great exfoliant - made we</li>
    <li> very sturdy and great for dry brushing. When I wash it, it dries quickly with minimal shedding. I will be ordering more for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This is a very invigorating dry skin brush. My skin looks great and I think it has helped with my cellulite some. It is better than the last dry skin brush I had. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This thing+ Retin A have done wonders for the chicken skin on my upper arms</li>
    <li> Brush is not too hard or soft.  Invigorating exfolient...perfect for just before shower.  Will purchase another when time to rotate out!</li>
    <li> Purchased similar brush in store and it wasn&#x27;t as nice as this one. It&#x27;s firm and has tons of bristles. I use it for dry skin brushing so not sure how it would be as a wet bath brush. Dry brushing takes at least 10-15 minutes for whole body so your arms can get tired. Think this helps because of the long, firm bristles so it kinda takes less effort. Good length for reaching all areas of back, not so long that it&#x27;s awkward but def long enough. Should last some time but I will order this brush again when needed.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it would be... But I really like it. It sheds a little. But I am pleased with it. Perfect for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> Works well. Just wish handle were longer.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> It works well.  A bit ruff but how else are you going to exfoliate?  It lasts.....still using it.  Prompt arrival.  Average cost.</li>
    <li> I need to get one for all my loved ones.</li>
    <li> I love this. It feels so nice against my skin. I dry brush before I shower, and then when I get out I apply either coconut oil, shea butter, or whipped shea butter (mine is just coconut oil and shea blended together) if I have some prepared. My skin is super soft. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Well upon the first use the bristles are shedding and falling out, so Im not sure how this brush is going to hold up and it makes a mess. We will see!</li>
    <li> love it! &amp; it shipped fast!</li>
    <li> My skin feels great. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and it&#x27;s become a very easy part of my routine.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I may order another one</li>
    <li> Just right...good robust bristles, nice handle, and fits nicely in my hand yet I can reach all over my back.</li>
