      <li>My mother&#x27;s favorite!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even know how in love with daffodils I am!  </li>
      <li>, so anything that still smells that good after so many hours has got to be a hit.</li>
      <li>Perfect if u like strong sweet flower like i do</li>
      <li>great bottle size for the price, I was pleasantly surprized by how large it was.</li>
      <li>It smells so good, it&#x27;s mild.</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
      <li>love the scent  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ll be able to continue purchasing it at a better cost.</li>
      <li>Mi wife love this</li>
      <li>i must  buy some more of it..</li>
      <li>Love my perfume and I get lots of compliments</li>
      <li>Better than outlet mall perfumaina or the alike stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have been stopped by people wanting to know the scent name many, many times over the years.</li>
      <li>When I did it was a lot more than I wanted to spend.</li>
      <li>It used to be my sister&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>Do I Love it....</li>
      <li>LOVE NARCISSE</li>
      <li>How cute.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I am pleased.</li>
      <li>I believe i have use the product for more then 10 years.</li>
      <li>Glad to find a fragrance that was discontinued.</li>
      <li>I start shopping at amazon to get a better price.</li>
      <li>I find that I can get the better value when I purchase the set with 6.7 oz body lotion and the 3..4 oz eau de toilette from bigdiscountfragrance for $35.</li>
      <li>Would most def recommend</li>
      <li>This is my mothers favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>It is such a priceless experience to be enveloped in this heavenly scent!  </li>
      <li>love chloe narcisse</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite fragrances, in fact I think my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love this scent since it came out in 1994.</li>
      <li>a great scent that enhances my lovely woman natural scent...</li>
      <li>I have always loved the smell of this perfume and haven&#x27;t really been able to find it in department stores in years and as soon as it came</li>
      <li>WHAT A GREAT DEAL and the shipping is super FAST (2-3 days)!</li>
      <li>From the second this precious juice hits my skin, my nose is inundated with fresh, dewy, delicious daffodils!  </li>
      <li>I will continue to provide to her till the end of time and its still available</li>
      <li>But this latest bottle smells not quite right.</li>
      <li>The scent is the original, not a copy.</li>
      <li>The perfume comes with its original box and plastic wrapper (includes bottle cap)&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended.</li>
      <li>It smells great long into the evening.</li>
      <li>This (I believe) is the original one.</li>
      <li>It is hard to improve a perfect daffodil, but this beauty pulls it off.</li>
      <li>HOW QUICKLY I RECEIVED IT AT HOME</li>
      <li>It is the warmest most seductive scent that I have been able to find...besides Versace Red Jeans.</li>
      <li>20 years later, I am still in love with this sweet, honey-floral scent.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think there is any time or occasion that this would be inappropriate for, but I do think this is a strong enough fragrance that the wearer must spray lightly to avoid overpowering those around her.</li>
      <li>I get so many accomplishment from others on its soft and gentle floral smell.</li>
      <li>Its mild and distinct at the same time.</li>
      <li>Very distinctive.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this product many times, usually always from a different company but am always pleased with the fast service and of course the product.</li>
      <li>I also get a distinct hint of sweetness unfolding as well, but my nose can&#x27;t identify which individual sweet or fruity notes are in the mix, only that it is absolutely intoxicating.</li>
      <li>This is the most glorious, highly sensual, extremely feminine, and exceedingly enjoyable fragrance I have encountered in a long, long time - perhaps ever.  </li>
      <li>Get some for your old lady now!</li>
      <li>Too soft, if that makes sense?</li>
      <li>she was so surprised when it came</li>
      <li>I can smell the bitter quality I have read mentioned in other people&#x27;s reviews, but to me it is gentle and not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>It is soft and simple, and not at all over powering.</li>
</ol>

    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite.  So I got it for her as a gift  She&#x27;s happy so I&#x27;m happy.  Just the size bottle she likes</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for 22 years!! I&#x27;m an walking ad for this perfume! People always say that I smell good.</li>
    <li> great bottle size for the price, I was pleasantly surprized by how large it was. I have always loved the smell of this perfume and haven&#x27;t really been able to find it in department stores in years and as soon as it came I had to spray it...mmmm! AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for over 10 years. It used to be my sister&#x27;s favorite. But this latest bottle smells not quite right. Too soft, if that makes sense?</li>
    <li> Smell is very specific to individuals. I love this scent since it came out in 1994. Amazon has the best price. Better than outlet mall perfumaina or the alike stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are into floral, this is the one to get. Very distinctive.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it!  Happy wife &#x3D; Happy life!</li>
    <li> Caught this scent on a waitress at the Perfect Landing Restaurant in Denver. Had my daughter ask her about it. Got it within 3 days from Amazon, the greatest shopping site in the world. Get some for your old lady now!</li>
    <li> This is the most glorious, highly sensual, extremely feminine, and exceedingly enjoyable fragrance I have encountered in a long, long time - perhaps ever.  This scent is such a treat for both the wearer and those around her.  From the second this precious juice hits my skin, my nose is inundated with fresh, dewy, delicious daffodils!  I didn&#x27;t even know how in love with daffodils I am!  The scent continues to unfold and just gets richer and richer from there.  It is hard to improve a perfect daffodil, but this beauty pulls it off. I definitely detect other florals, specifically a creamy gardenia. I also get a distinct hint of sweetness unfolding as well, but my nose can&#x27;t identify which individual sweet or fruity notes are in the mix, only that it is absolutely intoxicating. I can smell the bitter quality I have read mentioned in other people&#x27;s reviews, but to me it is gentle and not unpleasant. I would have expected to hate that part, but I don&#x27;t. To me it seems like it is just part of the spice profile. I have to admit something: I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrists!  I&#x27;m hopelessly addicted, and have been literally from the first spray. If possible, I plan to never allow this perfume to escape my collection.  It is such a priceless experience to be enveloped in this heavenly scent!  I don&#x27;t think there is any time or occasion that this would be inappropriate for, but I do think this is a strong enough fragrance that the wearer must spray lightly to avoid overpowering those around her. Enjoy this impeccable beauty!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 30 years I guess and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing. Everytime I tried something else my kids said I smelled different. They don&#x27;t like change. It is soft and simple, and not at all over powering. Great product</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it, it is now one of her favorites</li>
    <li> Mi wife love this she was so surprised when it came</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my mom. This is her &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; and she loved it.</li>
    <li> i have worn this for years,and years, and every time, someone asks me \\&quot;what are you wearing?\\&quot;, not only that but people will comment on the scent at 5 or 6 at night when i put it on at 6am., so anything that still smells that good after so many hours has got to be a hit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a birthday gift for my sister. I think they might not be making this scent anymore as I had a hard time finding it in the stores. When I did it was a lot more than I wanted to spend. This was a great deal.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product many times, usually always from a different company but am always pleased with the fast service and of course the product.</li>
    <li> Perfect if u like strong sweet flower like i do</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for years.  I am a teacher and every year I get a student or two that says, &amp;#34;I want to sit by you because you smell so good!&amp;#34;  How cute.  I have been in the checkout lane at the store and the clerk has asked what I am wearing.  I love this stuff.  I will wear it as long as I can!!!!!  It smells great long into the evening.</li>
    <li> I believe i have use the product for more then 10 years. I get so many accomplishment from others on its soft and gentle floral smell. I start shopping at amazon to get a better price.</li>
    <li> Couple years ago i was introduced this fragrance and finally found it back. Its mild and distinct at the same time. Lasts the entire day and i&#x27;m always being asked what perfume i&#x27;m wearing. Would most def recommend</li>
    <li> This is my mothers favorite perfume. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find locally, Ty amazon for making life easier.</li>
    <li> love chloe narcisse i have used it for over 15yrs, its great it stays with you all day</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance!!!!</li>
    <li> I received my first small bottle in 1994 to wear to my Junior Prom. 20 years later, I am still in love with this sweet, honey-floral scent. It is the warmest most seductive scent that I have been able to find...besides Versace Red Jeans. LOL! I find that I can get the better value when I purchase the set with 6.7 oz body lotion and the 3..4 oz eau de toilette from bigdiscountfragrance for $35. WHAT A GREAT DEAL and the shipping is super FAST (2-3 days)!</li>
    <li> People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing. It smells so good, it&#x27;s mild. I will recommend it. Love it.</li>
