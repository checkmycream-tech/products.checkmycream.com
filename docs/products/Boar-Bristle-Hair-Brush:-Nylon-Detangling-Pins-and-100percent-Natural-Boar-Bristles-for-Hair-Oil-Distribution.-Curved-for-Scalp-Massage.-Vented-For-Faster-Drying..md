<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am loving this brush...I used to have to use a paddle brush and a round boars hair brush to blow dry my hair and now with the new brush I was able to consolidate and just use the Vizeri brush....like a two-in-one!</li>
    <li> Love the brush!! Very easy on getting the tangles out and feels great on your scalp as you brush. I would buy another!</li>
    <li> What a great brush.  My head feels like a purring cat when I am done using this!</li>
    <li> won&#x27;t be buying this product again</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. It feels good on my head and makes my hair look better than it ever has</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t please with the hay-like result from my blow-dry using this brush.  I have fine, medium-short, one-length bob.  With all the other positive results it may just be how it works on my type hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING! I was skeptical when I first received it in the mail but the first time I used it, WOW! It went through my hair so easily! I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair that gets many tangles(it&#x27;s down past her backside) and it brushed her hair more easily than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used on it. I am impressed! I love that it is curved so it glides easily along the contours of your head also. This is without a doubt, the best brush I have ever used! I am skeptical no more! If you are tired of crappy brushes that fall apart, try this one. It seems to be very well made and like I mentioned, it glides through even long, thick hair with ease! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a week and couldn&#x27;t believe how much of a difference the right brush can make. At first, I thought it was not heavy enough because those were the types of brushes I was used  to. I&#x27;m really liking the feel of it, now. I&#x27;m liking how it seems to detangle with ease.  And, the bristles seem strong enough to last, so I&#x27;m waiting to see how it holds up. So far, this is a great brush!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️&lt;br /&gt;I love this hair brush. I had bought a similar brush without the bristles hairs but I accidentatly broke it. In need to buy another I was a little hesitant to buy a different one with hair bristles on it. So I did and bought the Vizeri vented boar bristle hair brush. Let me tell you I&#x27;m so please with my purchase. I have two daughters (9yrs old and 10yrs old) with long hair and brushing their hair with just any regular brush hasn&#x27;t been fun. lots of crying, complaining and excuses when it comes to hair brushing. As before I had mentioned the vented brush we love it. It detangles and it massages your scalp very nicely. But the Vizeri vented boar bristle hair brush gives you that and even more. As you brush your hair it give a nice massage to your scalp. Detangles amazing wet or dry hair. It works excellent on long or short hair and it even did a miracle on my hair extension that my daughter use for a holloween dance she had last Friday. The extensions got tangle really bad as as result of being synthetic hair and all the twirling around and dancing she did on the event. I used the brush and omg it tangled them and plus it added shine to them left them like brand new extensions. The bristle hair are amazing!!. My daughters absolute love this new brush. It leaves shines, it detangles and it massages their scalp in a amazing healthy way. I have not use any detangler spray or hair products just the brush which is a plus to save money on hair products. No more crying or complaining. And now they are brushing their hair all the time. I just love love that it doesn&#x27;t give you a frizzy look when brushing our hair when is dry,  instead it gives you shine and your hair feels smooth. The only complaining we do now is &amp;#34;who took the brush and they didn&#x27;t put it back&amp;#34; since we love it so much we fight over it. I will recommend it 100%. And the price was amazing.</li>
    <li> great brush, works amazing</li>
    <li> Great brush - feels terrific in my hair, does a good job.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick but fine. Normal brushes either just brush over the surface without getting to the bottom layers (the Natural boar bristle ones)  or they brush through all the layers of hair and leave behind a bunch of static so that I have hair sticking out all over the place (the plastic bristle ones). The Vizeri Beauty Curved Brush manages to brush my hair without leaving it a staticy mess. When I first took it out of the box, I was surprised at how large it was.  I had expected it to be smaller. When I first used it though,  I  really enjoyed the size.  The brush gently flexes while it is being used and I love the feeling of it &amp;#34;hugging&amp;#34; my head. In short, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! I have very long hair and lots of it so finding the right brush for me is a challenge. The brush definitely lives up to all of it&#x27;s promises. The curved design is amazing; I&#x27;ve never felt anything like it before. It really does feel like a scalp massage. The combination of boar and nylon pins work magically! Plus, they&#x27;re neither too hard or too soft. The brush also was fantastic when I blew out my hair. Like any vented brush, it definitely sped up the process. The brush is also very light but not too light and the grips on the handle make it very comfortable to hold for extended periods of time. The only issue I have with this brush is that it&#x27;s very awkward to use to make a ponytail, given the curved design and large surface area. I wear my hair up a lot for work so for me that&#x27;s an important feature, hence the deducted star. Otherwise the company itself seems to have better than average customer service. For the price point of this brush it&#x27;s a great buy and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!, I have been a fan of Boar Bristle Brush for a year now, and with in a year I have recommended the Boar Bristle brush to all my family members. At first I was septic, but once I got the brush myself &amp;#62;&amp;#62;I told my self there is no other brush that I will switch to. The brush has gentle flexibility to curve the shape of your head &amp;#34;great scalp massage.&amp;#34; My hair don&#x27;t rip while brushing, and is easy to untangle, it works great with all types of hair textures. My grand children are Oreo race &amp;#34;kinky hair texture&amp;#34; they never were so happy brushing their hair till I introduced them to Boar Bristle Brush. It truly works! I recommend this product to all of you! :) I have reorder these brushes five times.</li>
    <li> Item received as described. Purchased as a gift.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush with high hopes. I was a bit disappointed when the boar bristles started falling out. However, the seller emailed me soon after I noticed the problem. When I asked them if it was common for thick hair to cause bristles to fall out, they immediately put in an order for a new brush. It was on backorder so it took a little while (three weeks) but my new brush is so great! No bristles falling out and it moves sebum like a dream. I have high hopes to use this baby to get back to my cavegirl method! Sebum only all the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great brush. Awesome customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to star off by saying I never write reviews.  I&#x27;m lazy...  But for this brush I&#x27;m going to make an exception.  I bought this brush for my son.  He&#x27;s 10, has long, very thick hair that tangles like crazy.  This brush is great!  we used it this morning for the first time.  He got thru his hair in record time without complaint...  Then I used it too.  I have long, thin hair and it worked super well on mine too.</li>
    <li> I have been brushing my long, very thick, somewhat coarse hair with this every day since I got it. It has changed the way my hair hangs for the better. It used to be very dry and prone to frizziness. I never used to wear it down. Now my hair feels much healthier and I can wear it loose comfortably.</li>
    <li> This is good for me because I have long hair and the dainty small brushes I usually buy aren&#x27;t really working for my hair. But I can see this brush working for just about any type of hair since it&#x27;s made so well and the spacing between the bristles are a good size. I even used it on my hair after I curled the ends and it just glided right through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost never brush or comb my hair when its wet because it&#x27;s so long and ends up breaking or snapping off before I get to the end. I tested this brush out on my wet hair just to see if it would work and for the most part it did a good job but i don&#x27;t think this brush would work on really detangled wet hair. I made sure to brush my hair before I washed it and used a leave in conditioner to make it easier to brush and it still pulled my hair in a few places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this brush unique is that it&#x27;s curved unlike the usual flat brushes this one fits the roundness of your head. The other thing I really like is that the little bristles really do feel like a small scalp massage when you are brushing your hair. The bristles are nice and soft and don&#x27;t scrape my scalp like some of the other brushes I&#x27;ve used. I would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!! My brush arrived today and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I am from the old school and I still tease my hair. This brush is amazing! Didn&#x27;t have any trouble at all going through my teased hair. Not only did it get all the tease out of my hair without any problem..it also felt like I was getting my scalped massaged by the bristles.</li>
    <li> Perfect for De-tangling and smoothing my daughters hair</li>
    <li> Love how the brush feels and is contoured for your head. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush.  I wanted a boar bristle brush to disperse oil and after reading descriptions thought it would be a good idea to get one that also had sturdier bristles.  After reading the reviews, I realized that a pure boar bristle brush wouldn&#x27;t be helpful for actually combing out tangles because it was too soft so I chose this one.  When I got this brush I was quite surprised at how wide it was but, after trying it out, I like the fact that it is so wide.  The curved, wide shape is really nice and gives a nice scalp massage and the boar bristles seem to be picking up the oil and spreading it along the hair.</li>
    <li> I do love this brush. It feels so good on my head.  It feels just like a gentle massage when I&#x27;m done. The shape of it is really cool too, because it actually is shaped to your head. I think it is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used to help stimulate blood flow for hair growth. Detangles nicely too, hopefully they keep making this. I think it is a wonderful brush for long- med hair length, and thick - med hair. I would definitely but again.</li>
    <li> wonderful brush.. feels great on the scalp and leaves hair shiny and beautiful!  Cushioned and shaped.</li>
    <li> This brush is really light weight, and feels&lt;br /&gt;great on the scalp.  Thinking for ordering&lt;br /&gt;another one.</li>
    <li> Best brush i&#x27;ve owned. Kids love that it glides through their hair so easly</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair that gets tangled very easily. This brush just glides right through it! I am getting a second one to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s place.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I rarely leave product reviews even though I order just about everything from Amazon. I have tried at least three other boar bristle brushes without success because my hair is so thick that nothing felt like it penetrated to my scalp. This brush does just that, and it feels like a scalp massage. I also think the curved design and the fact that you can use it wet or dry is great design! I am very happy with my purchase and eagerly recommend this brush to others.</li>
    <li> Really nice brush that feels so good on your scalp. The brush does a great job at detangling your hair while helping smooth it at the same time. I love the curved design of the brush and how much of your head you cover with one swipe of the brush. I&#x27;ve only used this on my hair when I&#x27;m wearing it straight. Not sure how I could use it on my curls. My favorite thing about the brush is how it feels while brushing your hair. It&#x27;s almost like a scalp massage. Overall, a really great brush that I think would also make a great beauty gift.</li>
    <li> Works great for thin hair; likely not the best option for thick hair.</li>
    <li> This brush rocks my world! I use Moroccan oil in my hair and, combined with this brush, my air is smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom! Will DEFINITELY get another one when this one bites the dust!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this and loves the curve of it.  This is her favorite brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. I am very pleased with it&#x27;s curved bristle boars and how it doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp. I would highly recommend this brush to people with a sensitive scalp. I had already told my daughter about the brush and she seemed intrigued. It is a brush like no other.</li>
    <li> You think you are looking for a hairbrush, a detangler, a smoother.  You think you want this brush to part your hair, to straighten out knots but no, you will not look at this brush the same way.  I think I may move the brush from the bathroom to beside my bed.  When I am not brushing my hair I am thinking about brushing my hair.  It&#x27;s completely crazy.  What this brush does is massages your scalp.  It tingles and you want to do it more.  It is addicting.  I don&#x27;t care if it is detangling, all I care about is feeling that wonderful scalp massage! I am pretty certain it is stimulating some glands, some hair growth, who knows! Be forewarned it may not be for young kids.  My 6 year old said &amp;#34;ouch, this is an awful brush!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sure his head is much more sensitive so it depends on the kid and if they enjoy the strong bristly feeling.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at what a difference this brush makes with my hair. I have processed, thick, curly hair. This brush is great for after the shower detangling, blow drying, and when my hair gets frizzy after straightening I can use this brush to smooth everything out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very lightweight, which is great when you&#x27;re blow drying your hair for a while. All in all, a very solid purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this brush perfect combo of boar and nylon super gentle but gets the tangles out. Favorite brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I love the way this brush feels on my scalp. It is addicting and I brush my hair more than needed just to enjoy the way it feels. The curve isn&#x27;t a gimmick, it really creates an incredible scalp massage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been several days since I was using this brush, and I&#x27;m really excited about this purchase! I always knew about natural boar bristle brushes, but was never able to make them work for myself - they are usually too thick and just glide on the hair surface. Not this one - you can feel gentle massage on your scalp. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair flat, which I was concerned about, but seems to give it more body. After only a few brushings my hair felt silkier and less dry. And the price is great. Would definitely recommend this brush, and may buy some for presents. Thank you for making it available.&lt;br /&gt;Miroslava</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I have long hair it it feels great curved to my scalp.</li>
    <li> This brush made my hair incredibly soft and smooth. It also helped it feel less oily (I have fine  hair which shows oil easily)</li>
    <li> The best hair Brush I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush. I can&#x27;t believe how it so easily detangles my hair. I have never had any brush detangle my hair without pulling it out in the process. I just love this brush.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted but so much better than the original I bought from another company! A++++++</li>
    <li> I love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this brush in the mail, I was surprised at the size as I think it&#x27;s bigger than it looks in the picture. The first time I used it was on morning bed head and it glided right through without getting tangled. Then I tried it again when blow drying my hair. I don&#x27;t blow dry often as I have really thick hair that gets frizzy and takes FOREVER  to dry. Because of this, I never even bothered getting a vented brush. This really did cut down the drying time and my hair really wasn&#x27;t nearly as frizzy. Plus it did a good job of smoothing some of the curls from my hair while drying. This brush is most definitely worth the price in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Horrible service. Brush looks nothing like what is advertised. Very disappointed. Asking for a return.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this brush, intending on using it for my son&#x27;s hair.  He&#x27;s mixed and his hair when straight is past his shoulders.  I was hoping this brush could help when I need to detangle.  However, it is not great on his hair.  I ended up with the brush, and I actually like it for my own long, wavy hair.  It detangles better than my previous.  I would recommend, just not if you have super tight curly hair like my son.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever had, hands down. I have long, really thick, somewhat ratty hair, like if I try to brush it when wet, it would get stuck in my hair 6&amp;#34; down from my scalp (and yes, I know you&#x27;re not supposed to brush from the top, I&#x27;m just saying that for reference). I can&#x27;t let a round brush near my head or it may never be seen again. It normally takes me a few minutes to brush when dry, and probably about 5-10 minutes when wet (since you have to start at the bottom, etc). This brush...it almost makes me feel like I have normal hair :) It just combs right through when dry, and when wet, it takes half the time, and I definitely feel like I&#x27;m ripping less hairs out of my head. It&#x27;s true what other people have said about the static - it doesn&#x27;t seem to help that at all, but one can only expect so many miracles from a brush. If you have a lot of hair, I highly recommend this, it&#x27;s the bees knees!</li>
    <li> Works great! I bought this to replace my Paul Mitchell one that died, which was $99! So far it works just as well. Actually, I like it better because it&#x27;s so soft and doesn&#x27;t snag in my hair. Not that the PM one did, but this doesn&#x27;t even hurt when the bristles hit my scalp because they&#x27;re so freakin soft!</li>
    <li> If you have long hair, this is a life saver! As I was standing fighting with my old brush to get all the tangles out after my shower, I quickly remember that my Boar Bristle Detangling brush was just delivered. I quickly went to grab it. I have very long hair and usually it takes me a good 7 to 10 minutes to brush my hair out... however after using this brush for the first time I was detangled and brushed in no more than 2 minutes. This is a big deal. I love the huge vents for blowing drying too, I found my hair extra soft! I will be purchasing this for my sister and niece asap!</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  I have long hair and when I use this brush; it does as it says; distributes your natural oil to make your hair shiny.  Feels awesome when you use it as well.  It is shaped to the curve of your head.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush.  I love the shape of it, it really hugs your head and feels really nice against your scalp.  I find that I use it more times during the day than I normally use a brush just because it feels so nice.  After using it I can&#x27;t believe every other brush manufacturer doesn&#x27;t use this same shape.  The vents also make it great for blow drying.  I had been using a more expensive T3 paddle brush and like this brush better.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. With the 2 types of bristles it makes it so my hair is nice and smooth. My only issue is finding it as my kids love to borrow it for their hair. Great Brush best buy I have gotten.</li>
    <li> I am loving this brush!! It feels amazing to use. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to review the oil distribution claims, but so far I am very impressed and glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this type of brush to me and I did my research and decided to purchase this one. It is a GREAT brush! I love the fact that it detangles my super fine hair without ripping through it. Additionally the massaging action feels terrific on my scalp. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I can assure you, this brush is great !! I love it! This brush even gives me a great massage to my scalp and it detangles my hair, there is nothing bad to say!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this brush. Don’t discontinue the production! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the scalp. Helps to distribute the oils all the way to the ends. I usually tend to count the number of brush strokes I do at a time but the feeling of this brush on my scalp is so good that I forget or loose the count. Easy to clean and I didn&#x27;t loose a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush.  Leaves my hair feeling smooth and shinny.  I am not on for leaving a review but I would have to say this time it&#x27;s time to tell.  Now the natural wave in my hair looks like it should without frizziesI have also put to the test for not washing my hair for longer then a day and my hair doesn&#x27;t look oily or weighted down.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like this brush so much.  It feels great on the scalp, my hair feels softer and I don&#x27;t need to wash as often as it distributes the oils evenly throughout your hair so it doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all.The bristles are long enough to reach my scalp and the nylon bristles help to brush through thick hair. I loved the brush so much that I made two of my sisters try it and they both agreed it was great.</li>
    <li> What a great find!  I was shopping for a boar bristle brush with a large surface area, as I&#x27;ve recently changed over to a &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo&amp;#34; hair washing method, and it is said that a boar bristle brush is the best for distributing the natural oils from one&#x27;s scalp throughout the length of the hair.  The Vizeri product caught my eye, with the unique ventilation slots and curvature in the body of the brush.  So I ordered it.  When it arrived, it was a pleasant surprise to find it is not one of the &amp;#34;miniature&amp;#34; versions of a product that occasionally ship when you order online.  This product is flat-out amazing!  It massages my scalp when I&#x27;m brushing, and my hair loss while brushing has gone from &amp;#34;worrisome&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Thank you, Vizeri!!</li>
    <li> My initial impression was that this brush was too big and the shape was slightly odd. However, when I used it, I found the curved shape worked well. I felt a little like my scalp was being massaged (yes, I know Vizeri makes that claim).  I find this brush is effective at detangling my fine (but easily tangled) hair and my hair looks shiny. Boar Bristle is nice because it helps redistribute the oils in the hair. I think the nylon bristles help with detangling. I often use it on damp hair while blow drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this brush for review and it is currently one of my favorite brushes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush so far. I am a male with thick curly hair down to my shoulders. It brushes my hair with ease. Whether it be wet or dry. Thank you for developing such an outstanding product.</li>
    <li> I was really amazed the first time I used this brush. I&#x27;ve always stuck to wide bristle brushes because I have wavy hair. However, now that I have short hair this is the perfect solution to taming my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like a massage as it goes through your hair. The curvature of the brush fits it against your head and you&#x27;re able to brush about 1/3 of your hair with a single stroke. It leaves me hair feeling softer and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a lot bigger than I anticipated but it covers more hair in a single stroke. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> A bunch of friends in a beauty group were raving about this brush so the next time there was an awesome deal on it, I got myself one...let me tell you, I was not disappointed! I have a lot of fine, wavy, knotty hair and this brush is nothing short of amazing!!! I actually purchased another for my 6 year old niece. She has long fine hair as well and she&#x27;s always crying that mommy is ripping her hair out...not anymore!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull and snag you hair.  I do not have nearly as much hair left in the brush as with my old brush. This was bought for me but my daughter has snagged it from me!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this hairbrush at first, mainly because my hair has been through it lately (recently dyed and permed it), so it gets a lot of tangles/knots. After struggling trying to get a knot out with my pick last week, I decided to give this detangling brush a whirl. To my surprise, it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it every time I comb my hair since, and it works much better than trying to run a pick through my curly hair. There are a few spots I have to go over more than once to get the knots out, but it takes much less time than the pick. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! And so do my kids. Which is unusual! It feels nice on my head! It brushes my hair out nice and smooth. Makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! I read the reviews and honestly could not understand how a brush can be such an asset but this one is fantastic! I can now style my hair with none of the snagging issues and it creates such fantastic volume.  The older I get it seems like more hair comes out and after using this brush, my hair looks so full and shiny, I cannot express enough how completely amazed I am at what the RIGHT brush can do for your hair.  Obviously I  completely recommend this brush!!</li>
    <li> Lovely brush. cut down the amount of time it takes to blow dry my hair!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this hairbrush to my 14 year old granddaughter as a Christmas present.  She really loves it!  She has very thick hair that tangles easily and she says that this is the best hairbrush she has ever used.  I would highly recommend this brush to others.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that is normally straight but sometimes it gets unruly. This brush has made brushing easier and without the ususal pain of my Goody brush.</li>
    <li> The best hair brush I have ever used. My hair is soft and have lot of curls. We all know that we loose some hair every day. But, every other brush I used, removed so much hair when I used because my hair type. But this one removes not even  5-10% of what I used to loose before. I wish I had found this hair brush long time back. Excellent invention!!!</li>
    <li> Sharp ends coming out of tip Hurts scalp</li>
    <li> There are some really good aspects of this brush: the curve shaped feels really nice when brushing, the spacing between the rows makes it easy to clean, it distributes oils throughout hair pretty well, but it&#x27;s not quite what I was hoping it would be. The detangling pins are too harsh on my scalp, and I think if they were shorter the boar bristles would have more access to the hair. It may work for some people though, especially for those with really thick hair.</li>
    <li> I very rarely write a review but this is the best brush ever! I have fine hair and this brush feels so awesome on my scalp as it truly massages it while you brush it. I also have to wash my hair daily because my bang area gets so oily by the next morning..but not anymore. It took about a week to do the trick but this brush distributes oil from the crown of your head to your ends! Now I can skip a day, which before this brush, was unheard-of. GET THIS BRUSH. YOU WILL BE AMAZED  &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Awesome Comb! Daughters hair fall issue is considerably subsided - due to night time massage with this comb before going to bed.</li>
    <li> I like the brush a lot. Wanted a boat bristle to help my hair become shiny and manageable, and so far the brush is doing exactly that. I like the design of the brush as it contours the scalp perfectly.</li>
    <li> The best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Feels Wonderful</li>
    <li> Got this for a great price and the follow-up customer service has been better than any I&#x27;ve encountered; it seems the company really cares. At first I was a bit put off with how large it is because I was hoping to put this one in my purse, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. It is a little tricky to clean and using my fingers or a comb has pulled some of the bristles out, which happened very easily, so that&#x27;s not good. As the other reviewers have said, brushing feels like you&#x27;re giving yourself a lovely head massage, which encourages me to brush my hair more thoroughly than usual. For my fine, shoulder-length (and unfortunately thinning) hair that tangles easily, it pulls and tears too much and I see more strands left in the brush than I can deal with...and that IS a deal breaker. Hate to give up the scalp massage but will try to pass it on to one of my nieces who may love it.</li>
    <li> I like this, it&#x27;s a nice brush and detangles pretty well. Buuuuut (and there is one here) if you&#x27;ve got super thick hair like mine you have to work to get it all the way through. Which means for you moms out there you might have thick haired children pulling the old &amp;#34;it&#x27;s brushed&amp;#34; trick (I used to do) and the outside looks brushed, underneath they have missed some big tangles. For medium or other haired folks, it&#x27;s a winner- it feels great and doesn&#x27;t break off hair. I wish they&#x27;d make a version with longer bristles for people like me.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so great, I had a problem with my hair being oily and it was falling a lot too, and this brush is helping a lot!!! And also feels softer and look shinier! :) thank you so much for selling such an awesome product, a must  for my hair health now!!</li>
    <li> I have very, very thick hair. I love this brush! So far it works well on my hair that has already been dried. I hope it will be able to brush out wet hair as well. I like how the brush is curved. It really does make brushing my hair easy. I usually break brushes because my hair is so thick. This brush is pretty wide, but it works well.</li>
    <li> I bought a brush for my wife. She loves it. It detangles her hair easily and does feel like it is massaging your head as you brush. Not like other brushes where it feels like it is scratching your scalp. Instead it is soothing.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one for myself.</li>
    <li> I really really like the brush! Not sure why anyone would complain. The nylon in the bristles is so much better than just the board because plain board make my hair super flat or super staticky. This is way better.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts that the brush would be good for my fine hair. However, I must say, the brush is terrific!  I only wash my hair every 3-4 days so it does not dry out.  With this brush, I was able to go 5 days before washing as it really did help move oils from the scalp down the hair shaft and make my hair shine. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> No need for any other brush/comb.  This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair brush. Only for wet hair because it adds static to dried hair. Even in damp humid Seattle.</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever made. It&#x27;s the only brush that goes through my hair without any pain or effort even after hard core teasing</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush! Have been using it on my extremely thick hair and it is wonderful, keeps my hair shiny and healthy. Strong enough to get through masses of hair but gentle enough to keep from pulling it all out. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH...it makes my scap feel messaged and works to detangle my hair great</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have always wanted a boar bristle brush. But they was way out of my pocket book range. I have the opportunity to receive this for a honest and unbiased review. Boar bristle brushes are really good for your hair. They make your hair shine and cause a lot less damage to your hair compared to other brushes. The curve fits your head perfectly. I was amazed at this brush and at a good price too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually rave about hair products, but this one is great!  It works so well to detangle my fine, straight hair when it&#x27;s wet, and I gave one to my friend who has a thick long mane of hair, and she adores it as well.  I use it after my shower to detangle (but I don&#x27;t use it to dry) and then again at night to brush my hair before bed; it works nicely to distribute the oils in my hair before I lie down, and because of that, my &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; is usually much better in the morning than it used to be.  I love this brush!</li>
    <li> This brush feels sooooo amazing when I&#x27;m using it!! I&#x27;ve got curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it look gross or frizzy, though it does of course brush out my curls. I haven&#x27;t tried blow drying my hair with it yet but I&#x27;m almost certain it will do an incredible job! And I really  love that it&#x27;s curved to fit my head, it really makes a difference in the efficacy of my hair brushing!</li>
    <li> Nice brush for detangling , quality</li>
    <li> My wife is using the brush daily and loves it!  Thank you for creating a great product and for your personal service.</li>
    <li> I love this hair brush and have already ordered a second one.  It gives a wonderful scalp massage and makes my hair shine by moving oil from my scalp thru the hair all the way to the ends.  I even use it after shampooing while my hair is still wet; it detangles beautifully and doesn&#x27;t pull at all. I used to hate brushing my hair but not any more.  I guess it&#x27;s the boar bristles that make it glide thru my hair.....it&#x27;s relaxing and my hair feels fuller and stronger.  Can&#x27;t think of any way to improve it except to make a smaller version to carry in a handbag.  This one is a bit large to carry around but now I&#x27;m spoiled and don&#x27;t like to use my old brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this brush! After much debate on whether to buy this brush I finally gave into my desire and I am so happy that I did! This brush is great at getting out the tangles in my hair, especially after showers. I&#x27;ve had the brush for a couple of weeks now and I can already see and feel the improvement in my hair. My hair now has added shine and softness! Absolutely no regrets!</li>
    <li> BEST brush ever! Had to order another because my niece kept taking it! Great purchase!!</li>
    <li> Really love this brush. My hair really does feel softer, and it straightens better and in less time when using it with a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I bought it for my boyfriend for his beard, but it also works great on my long hair and on his short hair. Leaves the hair feeling really soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I am delighted to have the chance to tell you how happy I am with the brush I ordered. It arrived a few days ago, and I loved it from the very first stroke!  After shampooing my hair it detangled it easily and without pulling.  My hair, which is thin and fine, looked wonderful.  I was so impressed I immediately ordered two more to give to my daughters.  My husband loves it, too.  He says the bristles feel soothing and massaging and the curve of this brush is just perfect to get close to the scalp.  This is the best brush I have ever owned and I am very glad to let you know.</li>
    <li> I use the brush to brush my hair out everyday as well as blow dry.  it is easy to brush through tangles and easy to clean. I think I have noticed more shine and I am really happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair. Not super thick hair. This brush bristles are cheap &amp; flimsie. It was disappointing. I returned this brush out of principle.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my head whenever I brush my hair! Gets through the tangles.</li>
    <li> This brush is affordable and very gentle to hair. It detangles but doesn&#x27;t break the strands. I really liked it, though it&#x27;s better for straight hair.</li>
    <li> one of the best brushes I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new brush. It makes my hair straighter and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with tangling.  I use the brush in the morning and then again at night before I go to bed.  I really like the size of the brush, my hair is on the shorter side so it doesn&#x27;t take much to brush because the brush is so large. In addition to the benefits on my hair, my scalp also feels wonderful after I use the brush.  Thanks so much for making such a fabulous product.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. Since I started using this brush my hair feels like silk. Also, I have long hair and this brush untangles my it like no other...I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very fine hair that knots up easily.  I had found a brush that worked well but they don&#x27;t make it anymore and I can&#x27;t find them anywhere, so I decided to try this one.  It is amazing and she loves it!  (So do I)  It really goes through the hair easily and doesn&#x27;t rip your hair out as you are trying to deknot.  We highly recommend this brush!!  I also purchased a very similar brush that work just as great!</li>
    <li> This is the second brush I have bought in two weeks because my husband tried the first one and wanted his own. Our hair is completely different and the brushes work for our individual needs - (me) thick, curly shoulder length and (him) thick, straight, slight wave short length. Love the curved design and rounded tips. For us, the brush does what is advertised.</li>
    <li> I had one years ago that someone took that was a smaller version that I loved and thought that I would never be able to replace it as I had looked everywhere – beauty shops and stores, etc. So I am happy. I would still like to find one that is about an inch and a half across and was going to start my search for that again one day. It’s great that is has combination bristles and air vents for drying. I also enjoy the curved “paddle”.</li>
    <li> I have extraordinarily long hair (below my waist) so knotting and distribution of hair oils is always a problem for me.  I LOVE how well this brush works for me.  It gets through my long hair easily with no breakage and the contour of this brush feels really good on my scalp.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend and will be buying another!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it felt on my scalp and it worked great for blow drying.</li>
    <li> this brush is firm enough to go through my very thick hair easily, but is soft and gentle on my rather sensitive scalp.  Possibly the best hairbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> The brush works wonders. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush! My daughter is mixed with black and white and has very thick course hair and a ton of it! It takes about an hour to brush out her hair using a detangling comb but with this brush it takes 20 mins or less! And the best part is she isn&#x27;t pulling away and yelling that it hurts getting the tangles out. If I could give more stars I would!</li>
    <li> After reading all of the glowing reviews I had high hopes for this brush. I have long, thick, mostly straight hair and unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work for me...I&#x27;m thinking I may have just ended up with a &amp;#34;second quality&amp;#34; brush. Several of the nylon bristles were very sharp due to the tips not being molded properly. This of course caused the brush to rip out my hair with every stroke. My hair does feel softer after using the brush for a couple of weeks, but my hair also has a ton of static in it now. I really liked the curvature of the brush head though, so for that I&#x27;ll give it 2 stars. I&#x27;m not sure why every brush doesn&#x27;t have a curved paddle? Maybe I&#x27;ll see if I can find another one of these brushes in a store where I can actually look at the bristles first.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. It contours to your head. Feels good. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this in stores.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair brush for a person with long hair and it doesn&#x27;t go well with man with short hair. I tried it on my hair and it was clumsy to use and i gave it to my sister which she likes.</li>
    <li> I rub hair gel and shiner between my palms and put it though my damp hair and then use the brush to distribute the hair products evenly. The contour also feels good on the scalp.</li>
    <li> This is the worst brush I have ever used.  I have fine hair and lots of it and when I run this brush through my hair it hurts my scalp.  It&#x27;s as if the ends are sharp and pointy instead of having the little ball pins on the end.  It&#x27;s also a lot bigger than I expected. If I still had the packaging, I&#x27;d return it immediately.</li>
    <li> I got the brush but the handle came in loose. .when I was brushing my hair the handle came out..never buy it again. .very disappointed. .</li>
    <li> I love it! It feels really great on my scalp, and seems to make my hair less fly away. I would consider also purchasing a smaller one for my purse if it exists.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It has all the best qualities of a vent brush and a paddle brush.  It&#x27;s lightweight yet strong.  So glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> One of my daughters has thick hair and she loves this brush.  Prior to this brush she would complain that her hair always looked un-brushed but not anymore.  If you have thick hair this brush is the one to purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I have thick long hair and I was tired of stiff plastic brushes pulling my hair/hurting my scalp. This brush gets through my thick hair, feels soothing to my scalp with wet or dry hair. Took awhile to find the right combination- this is my new favorite! Packs well too.</li>
    <li> About two months ago I switched to the No &#x27;Poo method. My hair was definitely starting to feel it and my regular brush just wasn&#x27;t doing the trick. I heard that boar bristle brushes were great for people who were using this method so I decided to try it out. First of all, the couture of the brush is genius. It actually helps move oils through your scalp, rather than leaving them sitting at the top of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boar bristles feel like a mini massage and my hair always feels soft and silky after. Through the combination of the No &#x27;Poo method and this brush my hair is growing quickly, it&#x27;s soft, silky and no longer as frizzy. This is a serious accomplishment in the humid state of Florida. My hair is thick and curly too and I&#x27;ve tried every product available to help tame it. As someone who has never cared what type of hair brush I use I can honestly say I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular brush again. In fact, my others have officially gone in the trash!</li>
    <li> this brush would be GREAT for someone with thick full hair.  For people like me with very thin and fine hair, it is too big and bulky and actually hurts my scalp.  I am sure those with a lot of hair would LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> So far I really enjoy my brush, the curved design is great! I am currently on the &#x27;no shampoo&#x27; bandwagon and was advised to use a boar bristle brush to help distribute my hair oils. Thanks for the great product!</li>
    <li> Great product. Just started using it an­d so far so good.</li>
    <li> This brush is just what I was looking for - it grooms my thick hair easily, perfectly.</li>
    <li> I loved them. Purchased several and gave them as gifts. They also loved them.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and this brush works great. The mixed bristles works great with my hair. The curved design is amazing. It allows the brush yo massage my scalp.... I love it!</li>
    <li> I think the brush is great so far. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out if there&#x27;s a knot. Feels great against my scalp. I&#x27;d definitely get another one.</li>
    <li> I love the brush. It&#x27;s funny, I was just thinking the other day how great it would be if there was a brush that curved to fit my head and then I stumbled upon this one! Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my granddaughter. She loves it. She has thick hair down to her waist. This brush helps get the tangles out and helps to keep her hair shining and beautiful</li>
    <li> This brush is okay. I&#x27;m new to the boar bristle brush world. I&#x27;ve converted to the no-poo method and that&#x27;s why I purchased it. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again. Next time I&#x27;ll look for a brush that is full of boar bristles, and doesn&#x27;t have a curve. I thought this would be more ergonomic, but it&#x27;s actually not. Seeing that most of us have used flat brushes our whole lives, I find the curve to be awkward and cumbersome. I also find that I have to part my hair in a lot of areas and apply a lot of pressure to get the bristles to my scalp, which is the whole point of purchasing this brush - getting the oil from the scalp to the ends of the hair. It&#x27;ll do for now, but I&#x27;ll definitely choose a more traditional boar brush next time.</li>
    <li> The brush arrived within 5 days and I instantly fell in love with it!  As I&#x27;ve used it over the last week or so, I noticed it fulfills the needs of 3 separate brushes. It works great for blow drying because it is vented. The boar/nylon bristles are suited well for my fine-but-naturally-wavy hair, and it is the size of a paddle brush. It has a comfortable textured rubber handle which makes it more difficult to drop and the way it&#x27;s designed makes it easy to clean.     However, what makes this brush most extraordinary, is the unique curved shape and how it feels as the bristles move through my hair, massaging my scalp. It is a very nice tension reliever.  The brush moves smoothly through my hair without any pulling or snagging and has made my hair more soft, shiny, and manageable.    An extra-nice benefit of purchasing the Vizeri Beauty Curved Boars Hair Brush is that The President of Vizeri Beauty, Tim, goes over-and-above what most companies do these days and sends out an email several days after you order to see how the brush is working out.  He sincerely wants to hear from his customers and and to remind you of the 100% guarantee if you aren&#x27;t happy. He sends an additional email with a link to download a free e-book on how to care for your hair, and a code for a generous discount on the purchase of another brush!      EXCELLENT product.  EXCEPTIONAL customer service!</li>
    <li> I had it for two days... my girlfriend loved it so much she stole it and added it to her collection at her house.  I really liked the brush when I used it.  The two different types of bristles really straighten your hair out.  The thinner bristles are kinda massaging your head too which feels good.  Makes you want to brush longer.  I&#x27;m thinking about buying another for myself again.</li>
    <li> It gllides thru my hair easily, light and very comfortable to hold and i love the curved design!  That being said..... I was so sick of constantly buying brushes that the little plastic tips at the tops break off almost immediately.  I bought a detangling brush without those tips, but then the problem was the plastic bristles bent or broke off almost immediately.  I decided to give this one a try since it got great reviews.  They sent me a wonderful email with tips/instructions before I had even received it so I was already ready to give it 5 stars just for customer service.  I was excited to finally get it (I know... who gets excited about a brush.. right?).  I have very long, very thick hair that tangles easily, and although I didn&#x27;t buy it for the detangling properties, I can say that it worked better than the dozen different detanglers I&#x27;ve bought over the years.  I have been very careful and gentle with it, getting the majority of the knots out before using this brush, then I ran this one thru softly to get the rest of the tangles  I have used it maybe a dozen times and the little round tips are already chipping off. At least the cheaper ones I could get a few months out of before they broke off.  It was worth a try tho and I would recommend others give it a try, especially if the round tips breaking are not normally a problem for them.  UPDATE:  Only a few of the tips came off.  I have been using this daily for months now and no additional tips broke. I also gave up getting the knots out before using it because it is the best brush I have ever used to smooth those horrible tangles!!  As hard as I am on brushes, it is unbelievable it is still in this good of shape.  I will continue to buy this brush!!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of the brush and was excited about it.  Unfortunately, I experienced the same thing as a previous reviewer - the bristles scratch or poke at your scalp.  It&#x27;s not all of the bristles but a few that feel like someone sticking a needle in my head. I have used other boar bristle brushes without this happening.</li>
    <li> My Daughter said best brush she has ever used</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!!! I like to brush my hair just for the head massaging!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE it!!! I bought 2 of them, since my daughter just moved out on her own - I didn&#x27;t want mine disappearing - funny how that happens...lol.  I have fibromyalgia and this brush doesn&#x27;t just brush my hair - the way it &#x27;hugs my scalp&#x27; - it&#x27;s like getting a massage, much like reaching those nerve endings in reflexology. This brush is worth WAY more than what you pay for!!!</li>
    <li> good quality, nice hair brushhhh</li>
    <li> Omg I freaking love this brush so far so good the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that one of the plastic bristles came out the first time I used it other than that love love love I wish I found this so many years ago I will keep you updated ladies and gentlemen so far I haven&#x27;t tried it on dry here yet but on wet hair it works beautiful!!</li>
    <li> Fits my hand and contours nicely to my head.  Feels very nice.  I would have given 5 stars but would have liked a denser bristlel pattern.</li>
    <li> Helps dry my hair fast  and smooth without tangling my hair. I love Vizeri beauty products.</li>
    <li> Hello! Yes I did receive my brush. It seems like a really nice high quality brush. It is working great for my thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> I have to say I have never ever been someone that brushes their hair just to brush it. I also scoffed at all the reviews that made claims to how enjoyable using this brush is. It&#x27;s a brush! But now I have one and I am a believer. I just brush my hair every night now and it feels great. I love that it isn&#x27;t just boar bristle because I never felt that they really got all the way through my hair. This one does.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush, I love it!</li>
    <li> I love my Vizeri hair brush.  I&#x27;m not seeing the breakage that I had with my previous brushes and the curve, along with the shorter bristles give me a great scalp massage. &lt;br /&gt;I use my Vizeri brush on both wet and dry hair. It glides smoothly through both and I&#x27;m not pulling and tugging like I did with other brushes. &lt;br /&gt;I love the Vizeri brush and don&#x27;t ever plan on using anything else for as long as I have hair.  :-)</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. It&#x27;s not the best boar bristle brush I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s nice. I have waist length hair so have to use and other brush to brush out all the knots and start to blow dry my hair. Then I use this brush to smooth my hair out. It makes it so much easier to deal with my hair. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even need to use a straightener because this brush makes my hair smooth enough.</li>
    <li> OMG I&#x27;m in heaven when I run this brush across my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy hair, and this brush does a great job pulling the oils from my scalp and distributing them down to my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this brush now for a few months and people have commented that my hair looks fuller and shinier!</li>
    <li> I love my new brush! the boar bristles help my hair be smooth and the curve of the brush helps me get more hair in each brush so I don&#x27;t have to brush as much. the slits help me dry my hair faster since I have very thick hair. thank you for making such an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I was unsure about this brush because I have such thick and curly hair but I love it.  It detangled without pulling out all your hair, I have to order a few more for some of my friends. This is a great brush, I have thick and curly hair and it goes right through it without breaking. It&#x27;s very light weight and the curve fits your head so it is like a massage. Over all great brush need to order a few more for some of my friends.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several brushes online and at stores. This has been the best one I have used on my hair so far.  I have long hair to my waistline and this brush brushes my hair smoothly through to the ends. My only concern is that the white dots on the end of the bristles have fallen off within two weeks of purchasing the brush. I have noticed a difference now that the dots are not on the brush. The brush is not brushing well from the scalp area like before.</li>
    <li> I received the brush today and so&lt;br /&gt;Far it seems great! I&#x27;m hoping to grow my&lt;br /&gt;Hair very long- and also hoping this brush&lt;br /&gt;Helps that along :)</li>
    <li> This brush was recommended by my sister (who owns one) for my daughter&#x27;s knotted&lt;br /&gt;and unruly hair. It works great - better than any similar brush I have purchased. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This hair brush is just amazing. It has a good weight to it. It made my hair so soft and got out all the tangles easily. I love this hair brush so much. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great hair brush.</li>
    <li> I like it..works very well with my curly hair..</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Feels good and works good. I wish they had some with a little bit stiffer bristles as I would love to buy that also.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Helps to distribute natural oils from the scalp to the tips of the hair. Also, helps decrease the number of washes needed before hair starts getting greasy looking.</li>
    <li> I love it! The contouring/massaging bristles feel amazing. I am using his with a traditional boar brush in my no-shampoo regimen. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Best hairbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I love your product!  I have long thick Asian hair that goes down to my waist and the brush distributes the oil very well and makes my hair shine.  It makes me want to brush my hair even more!</li>
    <li> Best brush EVER!  My girls both have long hair and sensitive scalps.  We needed to find a brush that would be more tolerable for the two of them and Woolah this is the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally I was searching for this type of brush due to my hairdresser frying my hair when coloring it.  My hair was so dried out and breakage was occurring with each brush stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I reviewed many brushes on this site and went with this one.  Best decision ever!  I have less breakage and the shine of my hair is being restored.</li>
    <li> I have received the brush and it is simply amazing.  For the last three days, I&#x27;ve used it to keep my goatee in tip top shape. It straightens and gently brushed this delicate area not only more gently,  but with far more effectiveness than anything I&#x27;ve ever used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so very much for suggesting as well as discounting the brush.  If you had not suggested it, I might never have noticed, and wouldn&#x27;t have use of this wonderful device.</li>
    <li> Brush itself detangles quickly and easily. I really like the vented design as well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE BRUSH MAKES DRYING MY HAIR FASTER.ALSO CAN BRUSH TANGLES OUT OF WET HAIR EASIER.</li>
    <li> This brush works perfectly fine. My wife and daughter are very satisfied with it. It was actually my wife who ordered it. My daughter has wavy hair and my wife has curly hair. They both love it.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  I am going to order another one to keep in my purse.  I have been looking for a great boar bristle brush for a long time.  I was immensely disappointed in the m**** brush i had purchased earlier in search of the perfect brush, especially when it cost $$$$!!!  However, this curved brush far surpassed that extremely expensive brush.  This curved boar bristle brush goes through my hair easily and even reaches my scalp!!  This is the brush for me. I have finally found the brush I need, for it goes through my long thick hair without snapping my hair nor just floating on top of my hair.  It is the best brush!!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best brushes I have EVER used! The brush curves to my scalp and brushes the tangles right out. I love having my hair brush so its very soothing :) I would have never thought by the looks that it would work so well but it really does!&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend</li>
    <li> For decades, I shaved my head every month or so.  A couple years ago, I was poised to do my monthly-ish shave, but a planned work trip got canceled, so I skipped that month&#x27;s shave.  More months went by and eventually, I decided that I&#x27;d see what it was like to have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few gentle remarks from my wife about needing to comb my now-pretty-long hair, I asked her for recommendations on a brush.  We ended up going to a well-known beauty supply company and I bought a regular hair brush and I tried to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I suspect ladies reading this review will be rolling their eyes at my reaction here, but every single time I used that regular hair brush -- even when I was as gentle as possible -- it hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion was this:  my head (like most, I imagine) is relatively round and this regular brush is flat, so a very small area of the regular brush is in contact with my head and that just seems like an incredibly inefficient way of brushing my hair (maybe okay for the hair from the neck down, but definitely not the hair on my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspected there was a better solution out there, so I searched for &amp;#34;curved hair brush&amp;#34; and after a few false starts, spotted this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and I was a little disappointed that it had popped out of the clear box it normally comes in and was rattling around in the cardboard box with my other Amazon items.  Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t seem to have been damaged in any way, but I think that a small piece of tape at the top and the bottom of the clear box would have kept it secure during transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I picked up the brush and first noticed the rubberized handle -- a nice feature that I hadn&#x27;t even expected.  I then gently applied the brush to my head and just knew that this is how a brush is supposed to feel!  It &amp;#34;hugs&amp;#34; the curve of my head, helping distribute the natural oils from my scalp along the length of my hair.  And -- as I&#x27;d hoped-- it didn&#x27;t cause any kind of discomfort like that other regular, flat brush I tried to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus was the &amp;#34;Love your hair&amp;#34; PDF provided by the company which explains exactly how hair works -- what it&#x27;s made of, how to take care of it, etc. -- something that I, as a guy, never really gave a lot of thought to, but need to know if I want it to look decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and might have even talked my wife into getting one for herself.  :)</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this brush!  I was thinking of ordering another one, or&lt;br /&gt;2!  I knew I would like it when I saw the curve design; who has a flat head?  It&lt;br /&gt;really does just &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; my head well when I brush it and the combination of&lt;br /&gt;bristles and metal tips seem perfect for me...  It grabs every hair on my head&lt;br /&gt;and really massages my scalp and distributes the Argon oil wonderfully...  The&lt;br /&gt;brush also is wonderful for styling, as it makes my hair quite voluminous!  So&lt;br /&gt;much volume, I have to calm it down!  A bit to much information here, but it&lt;br /&gt;does a wonderful job of gathering up old hair...  I never have to clean up the&lt;br /&gt;shoulders of my clothes before I go out...</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. The concave shape conforms to the shape of your head which helps with styling. Since it is vented, this allows hair to dry quicker. The last brush I had of this type did not have the boar bristles. I would definitely recommend this one with the boar bristles - it really works for detangling and styling and your hair won&#x27;t get caught. It is also very light weight, which also makes for easier styling.</li>
    <li> I loved this brush when I first received it.  I love the way it curves to your head and allows the air to go through.  Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t even had this brush for a month and it is broken.  The head detached from the handle.  $15 down the drain.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Thank you for reaching out to your customers for comments. I love the hairbrush, and it does everything it was described to do. I even let my daughter try it and she was so amazed at how easy it was to get her tangles out that she had asked me to please help her get one too.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this brush. I didn&#x27;t expect to see much of a difference from changing my brush, but I did! Very happy with this product. I have been brushing morning and at night. I notice that my hair is shinier, softer and less frizzy. I am planing on buying another brush for my sister. I am a satisfied customer, thank you.</li>
    <li> Feels like a massage for your head.  I love this brush.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this brush. Great price, good quality, and use it before I take a shower.</li>
    <li> When I first got the brush, I was excited to see for myself. I had high expectations for it with all the good reviews. Not even exagerating, the first brush of my hair I fell in love with it. This brush is night and day compared to others. I also own one of those pricey $100+ Mason Pearson brushes (which I love) but this brush is even better in my opinion and for only a fraction of the cost! I love it. Also very friendly customer service</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. It doesn&#x27;t tangle or pull at my hair and leaves my scalp feeling like it has been massaged. It&#x27;s a little too big (I only have short-medium length fine hair) for me but it works quite well. Looks durable - excellent quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I have very thick hair so have a hard time getting totally through my hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is made so it is sculpted to your head! It feels really nice as you use it, and it leaves my hair feeling SO smooth. I have several brushes at my vanity, and ever since I got this brush, I haven&#x27;t reached for any other.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush. The contoured shaping feels so good. Great for styling as well. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Nice brush but I need stiffer bristles!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  The curved part of it feels really good on the my scalp.  It does detangle very well.  I have pretty thick wavy hair and I just love this brush.  It is so much better than my old one.  My daughter has long hair so I am going to order one for her too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before ordering this I had used the same old brush for several years.  I took a chance and got this and I am glad I did!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for a week and so far I am really liking the brush. I have been using it mainly in the mornings on wet hair. I have used it a few times on dry hair, and am happy with how it smoothes and shines my hair. I have not yet used it to dry my hair with a hair dryer, but plan to do so in the future and am predicting good results. Brush reaches through to my scalp without feeling uncomfortable as many bristle brushes can do. It is also great for detangling without hurting. FYI: I have thick wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I love, love this brush!  I have another brand curved brush without the boars hair bristles and it does not work nearly as well.  I prefer a curved brush to a round brush for blow drying and the boars hair makes all the difference in the two brushes.  I achieve a much smoother finish without fly-aways with this brush.  The price point was very reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Love the way it feels when you brush your hair.  It is so easy to use when styling your hair. Leaves your hair real soft.</li>
    <li> I just love this hair brush!&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally wavy, frizzy hair and when I use this brush, it gets my hair very smooth and manageable. I would definitely recommend this hair brush by Vizeri Beauty! Satisfied Amazon customer!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice quality brush!  It works well on my son&#x27;s hair which is fine, some brushes with bristles like this tends to give fine hair like his static electricity, but he didn&#x27;t experience any static electricity when he used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, it was also powerful enough to tame my daughter&#x27;s hair and even make it nice and shiney.  She has extremely coarse hair and so she really has a hard time with brushes, especially as she has been known to get insane tangles!  She absolutely loves this brush!  She straight up told my son that she was claiming it and to keep his hands OFF!</li>
    <li> SO, shipping took awhile and I didn&#x27;t hold much hope out for a hairbrush that would matter but this one did.  I have thin hair...a lot of it, but, thin so it tangles easily and I&#x27;m a big whiney baby about it.  On bad days, I cry when I brush my hair (told ya I was whiney).  Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure how this hair brush could possibly make a difference but it does!  I&#x27;ve had one other hair brush in my life that didn&#x27;t hurt but the bristles fell out of it and I&#x27;ve been looking for another ever since but I&#x27;m not sure what makes these brushes so remarkable.  I&#x27;ve got thirty brushes at home that make me miserable but I will be tossing them all now that I have this baby.  The bristles aren&#x27;t hard, maybe that&#x27;s the difference?  Also, at the bottom of the bristles are that boar hair stuff, which I&#x27;ve never used but omg, whatever it is that makes this brush great, I&#x27;m ordering another for me and another as a gift for my beautiful niece that has her aunt&#x27;s hair and even worse, my temperment.</li>
    <li> This brush has a very weird toxic smell that made my daughter refused to use it. I smelled it myself and was really put off by it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  I wish they would come out with one for thick, coarse hair with longer and stronger bristles, but for now this one helps a lot.  I use it with their hair products and my hair is soft, shiny, and manageability has improved greatly.  I&#x27;m very happy with this brush.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny ...I literally make all my friends regardless of hair length try my awesome new brush!</li>
    <li> Good detangling brush. I like how it is curved.</li>
    <li> My new favorite brush! I think everyone needs to own one like this. The boar bristles are extremely gentle on the hair-mine is thick and tends to tear and fuzz up if I don&#x27;t have a good brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Which has meant for most of my life I haven&#x27;t been one to brush my hair. I will shower, towel dry, air dry &amp; pull the tangles out with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read a lot about boar bristles and every time I see them in the store they are so super expensive it&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great if you have the money and want healthy hair but not available to the masses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I snagged one of these when they went on sale. It is large enough that a few swipes are all I need to brush my entire scalp, and the shape is nice and conformed to the shape of my head.&lt;br /&gt;So when I&#x27;m in a hurry, I&#x27;m not knocking my own noggin&#x27; with a clunky straight brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really fond of this one, and I love my hair so I like to be gentle on it. If you see this one on sale, do yourself a favor and snag the deal. It won&#x27;t snag your hair!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush for blow drying my wet hair.  It takes a lot less time than my old brush.  It&#x27;s also made getting through my daughter&#x27;s long hair much easier.</li>
    <li> Love it! Does a great job detangling your hair. Great quality and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a long time now and my opinion hasn&#x27;t changed. It&#x27;s still a great brush. In fact, it&#x27;s really the only brush in my arsenal that I use. I&#x27;ve had this thing for almost a year and not one of the little rubber pegs on the ends of the plastic bristles have fallen off. Not one! You know that always happens to those regular old brushes you get in a store and the hard plastic ends up scraping your head. Not so with this one! The boar bristles have stayed put as well. Honestly the only thing that&#x27;s happened is their name has rubbed off the handle from so much use. I reckon that may be a good thing, if you want to look at it that way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The picture of my brush is from several months worth of everyday use!)</li>
    <li> Awesome brush!! I am doing the low poo/no poo thing and this brush is awesome! Feels so great on my head and doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the tangles. So great in fact my friends want me to order them one.</li>
    <li> For the most part I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this brush.    Positives: company has been very proactive about contacting me about any potential problems, and following up to make sure I am satisfied with the product. I was surprised how much a difference the curved design makes. I usually have trouble with the solid (no cushion supporting the bristles) brushes feeling uncomfortable, but this one feels incredible. I love the nylon and boar bristle hair combination. The brush works really well at working through the layers in my hair rather than just the top layer (compared to other boar bristle brushes). I found the brush really easy to clean and remove my hair from.    Negatives: there are times I wish there was more  bristles or that the brushes hairs/bristles were  arranged in a more compact manner. Also after brushing, it sometimes seems the boar bristles are spreading or splaying. A more  compact or closer design might alleviate the problem. The brush was larger than expected. I love it, but wish they also has a smaller size for easier travel.    Overall, I recommend this brush. I&#x27;ve been using it every day, multiple times because I like how it feels.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, so I was so pleased this brush didn&#x27;t make it frizzy. It got through even my toughest tangles without excessive pulling and seems to be very sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome. You wouldn&#x27;t think it would actually detangle but for my super damaged hair it&#x27;s gentle enough to get out knots. It&#x27;s great to use with my hair oil treatments to distribute through my hair evenly. My only complaint would be the envelope packaging it was shipped in was huge, so a bit wasteful.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush and seller,you will love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a while now. I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t come across tangled hair since I&#x27;ve used this brush and when using more natural hair products, trust me, you experience tangled hair far more easily. It also has a nice curve that goes well against your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed it leaves my hair nice and shiny which is a plus. I was hoping it would distribute the oils in my hair a lot more than it does. My hair still becomes greasy after a day or two of not washing. But its not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> Transaction went well, not to pleased with brush ,It is wider and softer bristles than I like.</li>
    <li> This is nice brush to use. Very soft and distributes the argan oil properly through my hair. The curved shape makes it easier to get the brush through my hair. Overall i am pleased with this purchase. My hair do not go through the abuse that my earlier brushes did.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for me, and I have straight long hair. Like this product.</li>
    <li> I love this brush it works very well on my hair, I color my hair and it can get fragile sometimes and this brush really helps...</li>
    <li> I really do like this brush.  It is very flexible and feels really good when I use it.  My main use is to lift wide sections of hair away from my head to blow dry it.  The brush is exceptional in that it is wide, so I can do a large section of hair on the back of my head and that keeps the hair from separating when dry.</li>
    <li> This brush left me wondering, why the heck have I not had a boor bristle brush before? I have curly frizzy hair and this brush not only makes my hair more smooth and manageable but the curved brush feels so nice on my scalp.  I will never ever go back to a plastic square brush ever again.  I have been converted. The shipping was quick and the details are spot on, and not a bad price I may add.  I am so happy with this purchase and if needed I will purchase again. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a brush to replace my favorite brush that finally called it quits.  This is it!  I&#x27;ve gone through 3-4 brushes in search of something that I would love, and I found it!  I have lots and lots of very long (to the small of my back), fine hair.  I love this brush.</li>
    <li> I really love curved brushes as they feel great on your scalp while you are brushing. This brush is the first one I have owned with boar bristles included, which makes this brush even better. It does a great job of detangling my thick hair and a fair job of smoothing it. I think an extra row of boar bristles in between each row would be a huge improvement, but it isn&#x27;t a huge deal to me. My only really issue is that it is somewhat flimsy, although it does seem sturdier than curved brushes I have owned in the past. I would recommend this brush to other people and would buy again in the future. Update 3/3/15 They already broke. Both the one I bought and the one that they sent me for reviewing their brush. It&#x27;s been about 3 months and that is just unacceptable. The first brush that broke I carried in my purse so I originally blamed myself for that one, but then the other one broke. The 1st brush broke in 3 places right where the bristles are inserted. It can&#x27;t be used at all. The 2nd just sits on my vanity and gets used a couple times a day. I didn&#x27;t even use it while blow drying my hair-but still, the handle popped off. I really loved using this brush but it&#x27;s of poor quality.</li>
    <li> I really like this curved brush, because it feels great on my scalp while I&#x27;m brushing. This is a best brush I&#x27;ve ever used, so I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush.  It does not give my hair static like 100% boar bristle brushes do.  I like the curved design, it seems to help my hair look fuller.  It takes s little bit of getting use to but it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  Hairbrushing is major drama in our house and this brush has helped end it!</li>
    <li> This brush feels good during blow-dry use, but must be brought up and away from hair to get some lift, to help my hair dry better. This can be a little difficult due to the curve of the brush. It seems to prevent as much body from being created &amp; weighs my hair down a little more than I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;ll have to work harder on figuring out a different ratio of heat protectant to use, than my usual amount, since this brush really does what it says in regards to good oil distribution. (Hair grade info: I have long, thick relaxed/straight hair; biracial: black &amp; asian)</li>
    <li> This brush works great it really combs my hair how I like. I have wavy hair and it helps to deal with my hair on those bad hair days. Best brush!</li>
    <li> I have these long hair that gets tangled all the time.  This brush sure gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair brush because my hair was dry, full of tangles and my large amounts of hair would get pulled out whenever I used other wide-tooth combs and brushes to groom my hair.  I was desperate so I decided to give this product a try.  I tried this item and I am happy to say that it is a great product.  I helps gently remove tangles.  My hair is smooth, soft, shiny and tangle free!  I would highly recommend this product.  The delivery was also very fast.  If you are interested in buying a detangling brush, buy this item without hesitation.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is more than just a brush. Functionally, it does everything it says it does for your hair. But, I think this brush&#x27;s best feature is how it FEELS when you brush with it. I&#x27;d buy it just marketed as a &amp;#34;scalp massager&amp;#34;! Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush!!!  I plan on ordering several more to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> This brush is fabulous! Feels nice! Super high quality! Love it! *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> A++++++ very fast shipping and very nice quality brush!!!!! Great seller</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush.  It brushes through my thick  short/medium hair.  I like the way it makes the scalp feel.  Use it on wet and dry hair</li>
    <li> Really like this brush a lot.  It brushes through my hair (and microlink extensions) without yanking or breakage.  Great find!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  Used to have to drench hair in product to avoid frizzy, tangled mess.  Extra bonus is what a great feeling it is to use!  No lie, it feels like a message.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month now and it&#x27;s okay.  The longer plastic bristles do not feel like a massage on my head or my kid&#x27;s head.  This is not a brush designed to get tangles out, I use it after I have combed their hair free of tangles just to get the natural oils in their hair to every strand.  Personally I think it would be better to lose the plastic bristles.  However the curve of the brush is nice.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this brush gentle message for your head</li>
    <li> great brush, going threw my hair really well, makes my scalp tingle.</li>
    <li> Wow, nice brush!  Firs the contour of my head and feels so good.  Works well on both wet and dry hair and I even use it like a paddle brush when I blow dry.  I hope I get many years of use out if it!</li>
    <li> I love the curve and lightweight feel of this brush, but the bristles are too soft/flexible to get through my thick, easily tangled hair.  Because the bristles bend so much, The brush doesn&#x27;t reach my scalp and is little help with the tangles.  If you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair or have finer hair, this could be your perfect brush.  But if you have coarse hair, really curly hair, or a lot of hair, don&#x27;t waste your time on this brush.</li>
    <li> This brush will change your life ! It gives you the best head massage, makes me want to brush my hair for 30 min when I get home frome work. I might be wrong but I also feel like my hair is a lot softer now that I use this brush. You must get this brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  I usually struggle to brush my thick &amp; unruly hair.... but not anymore. Now it&#x27;s a breeze. I&#x27;m not really sure how it works but it sure does!  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much that I have ordered 5 of them. One for my daughter who has four daughters with long hair and the other four for me! One for each bathroom, one for my purse and one in case I lose one! I love this brush! I have a total of 5 other different types of brushes, but none of them leave my hair where it&#x27;s supposed to be...on my head. This one does.</li>
    <li> This brush is a definite keeper. I use it twice a day to give my hair a good brushing. The bristles honestly like you are getting a scalp massage. I then use it to dry my straight hair and find it cuts down on my drying time. I showed it to my hairdresser and she is going to order two to use on her customers. Highly recommend and with the curved design it almost molds to your scalp.</li>
    <li> I was stoked to get this brush. It arrived yesterday. I used it for the first time today and was loving it until it broke in half mid-stroke. Bummer! I&#x27;m returning it. I&#x27;d be willing to give it another try b/c I really did like it...my only option was to return it, not replace it. Maybe they will replace it for me for my troubles...I hope.</li>
    <li> Works well but my hair is very thick and curly and could use a little stiffer bristles - even when straightened. But if not as thick, this brush will be fantastic. The design with curve is great for overall brushing</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush! It&#x27;s like getting a scalp massage every time I use it. My daughter has a sensitive scalp and she loves it too. The first time I used it on her she said &amp;#34;see mom, these are the types of brushes you should buy.&amp;#34; Lol</li>
    <li> It was larger than I thought it would be, but now that I&#x27;ve used it, I really like it.  The curve of the brush makes it fit the head nicely and get close to the scalp.  And it definitely distributes the oil through my hair, makes my hair shine.</li>
    <li> I use this brush daily. It does not hurt to brush my hair out, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from this brush or not. I do like the brush though. I like that it&#x27;s vented. I actually use it to help dry my hair. Good purchase, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for a different brush than a 90 cents brush at Walmart and I picked this one.&lt;br /&gt;I did not pay enough attention but I assume this brush is only for very long hair and mine is very short. wanted to return it but I noticed....&lt;br /&gt;boy does that brush feel good on my head. Its like a giant hand caressing my hair. Half my head is brushed with one stroke and the shape just fits perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Never in my life did I think I would enjoy a hairbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I will not return it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my thick hair and I love it. My daughter has a long hair she loves it too the fact that it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair too hard</li>
    <li> This is such a great brush. I&#x27;m happy that I bought it! I&#x27;m usually extremely picky on the types of brushes that I use in my hair because many of them make my hair look way worse, instead of better.   I only brush my hair once a week since I have curls and usually brushes just cause my hair to tangle or frizz up. I love that this brush has wide spaces, is curved, vented, and has boar hair. I love the size of the brush too since I have a big head of super curly hair!  It works great after I have put a conditioning treatment in my hair. It helps detangle it and gets rid of any loose hairs I have.    My hair feels smoother and tangle free and also looks a bit shinier. Perhaps this is because of the boar hair bristles? All I know is that I really love this brush and recommend for other people who suffer from monster tangles in their hair too!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I&#x27;ve been using the same brush for years because I couldn&#x27;t find one that I liked as much. Well, move over old brush, the one is way better! I love how it&#x27;s curved to fit the shape of my head. This brush works great at de tangling my hair without pain or lots of ripped hairs. It just glides through even on my messiest hair days. It&#x27;s a nice sturdy brush, too.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!! My hair dries much faster than with a regular hairbrush and it leaves my hair super shiney! The only problem is that my daughter keeps stealing it from my bathroom! Best. Brush. Ever.</li>
    <li> I like this bush, works great on my long, thin, fine hair!</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t know this but now I brush before I comb. As a guy I have long hair and it can get pretty tangly. This curvature of this brush goes through my hair smoothly. After brushing real quick I end up using my comb without fear of hitting a tangle and wincing. It&#x27;s definitely a nice brush for the price.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love the brushes.  There is something about the curve and the width that makes hair brushing more thorough&lt;br /&gt;and pleasurable.  We have one at each sink and our go bags.  We have given them as gifts and those people love them as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever owned. The curve of the paddle fits the head in a soothing and logical way. The boar&#x27;s head bristles help distribute the natural oils of the scalp. For those who have embarked on a shampoo free regime, this brush is a necessity. But it is also a good brush for anyone. It provides a very pleasant brushing experience.</li>
    <li> love the brush, however, wish it&#x27;s bristles were a little coarser as my hair is thick and it takes a couple of pass throughs to get all the tangles out</li>
    <li> My mother likes using this on my daughter better then the tangle teaser. My daughter also complains less with this brush. But I like the tangle teaser better because it seems like this one may pull more hair out. and it doesn&#x27;t detangle as effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I finally found a hairbrush that I can use.  My arms cannot go up to the top of my head. Because of this it is very hard to brush my hair.  With this brush I can brush my hair and also brush behind my head.&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush and want to buy one for all my friends for Christmas! I wish I had found it sooner! It does all the things it says. My favorite is that it really does massage your scalp.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush!  I love it and my 3 daughters want one too!  Even if you feel like your hair is a mess you can easily and smoothly brysh through even the longest thickest hair.  It makes me feel like I have a new and improved head of hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I think this brush may be great for others&#x27; hair, just not quite for mine. I bought the brush for the boar bristle aspect and was quite impressed at the number of boar bristles and the fact that they all appeared to be real, not interspersed with plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair thickness is probably somewhere between thin and medium and because the nylon pins were so long, my hair never actually touched the boar bristles, at least at the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush also made my hair lie extremely flat at my crown. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, though, which the brush is obviously designed for so perhaps that was the reason.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. It was the only vented curved detangling brush with boars bristles (at the time of my search), which is a huge plus. It is exactly what I wanted. Great with my hair wet or dry. It is curved perfectly for my head, not too big. Not heavy. It has helped shortened my hair drying time (which I was hoping for) and has given me an extra day before washing like the description stated, thanks to the boars bristle.  Also easy to clean.  But most amazing of all is I have been able to untangle my daughters very  fine, prone to matting, wavy hair. I am very excited about this since I have tried many ways to help get a brush/comb through her hair. Very much worth my money.</li>
    <li> Good brush, also feels nice - massages the scalp.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever!!!! It glides thru the hair even if you have not brushed your hair since the morning(to go to work).  I bought 2 one for the car and one for the house, when I&#x27;m stuck in traffic I brush my hair and have a scalp massage to relax me! I have not used it when my hair is wet, can not get past a life time of being told how damaging it is to brush the hair when it&#x27;s wet. I&#x27;m glad I ordered 2, will be giving them as stocking stuffers this Xmas :)</li>
    <li> I have medium straight hair and I must say I am enjoying this brush very much! The innovative curved shape feels so nice on my head and it is neither too hard or too soft, I would say it is just perfect! Although it feels better to use on on dry hair, I use it both on wet and dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit worried at first because some bristles came off but it only happened during the first few uses. It has been over two weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen any more bristles falling off. I would definitely recommend this brush to people who want the best for their hair and are looking for a good brush to help with making it look healthy and shiny!</li>
    <li> Works great!! I have long curly/kinky hair and this glides right through without an issue. Not sure about the drying faster but I do think it dries better than before.</li>
    <li> The Boar Bristle hair Brush is huge close up then what it looks likes like in the pic. This brush is definitely not for the tender headed but it your head is not tender then this brush will defiantly feel like a head and scalp massage. It smooths out the hair and it leaves it shiny. I tried it on my hair dry so now I have to try it when my hair is wet.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this brush because she noticed her hair has been drying out more easily and wanted to try something different to see if it would help. Having generally used the &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34;-type brushes that you buy at the drug store, she was extremely impressed with this brush! The quality of it, the design that curves around the head for full contact, and the wonderful scalp massage are all of her favorite features of the brush. HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> My favorite new brush!!&lt;br /&gt;This brush is light weight with a curved head and provides a great scalp massage when you use it. The handle of the brush has a textured handle making it easy to hold and is very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I lived without this brush! I have thin hair but LOTS of it and it&#x27;s wavy - the result is always a TANGLED mess! This brush LAUGHS at my rats nest and makes controlling my locks less of a chore. It&#x27;s light and the contoured shape really does seem to make a difference. The combined bristle types do the trick for post shower brushing and styling with hair dryer ...</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic. I have very fine, thin hair, and an implant on my brain just under my scalp that can be painful with brushing, so I am loathe to use a brush as they rip out the precious little hair I have and can hurt. However, I read on a hair website that boar bristle brushes are very good for your hair, so I decided to buy one. On that website their brushes were over $40 each, so I decided to look on Amazon. When I saw this brush with the curved paddle, I decided to give it a try. Wow! First time I have actually enjoyed using a brush!  The curve of the paddle makes a huge difference to me. Plus, the boar bristles combined with the plastic ones with balls on the end make it</li>
    <li> I gave the brush to my 20yr. Old Granddaughter, who was so pleased. She loves hair brushes for her long natural body hair, which she straightens. The next morning, I received a text. &amp;#34; Grandma, it&#x27;s awesome, Thanks.&amp;#34; It passed the test.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush! Happy with my purchase, it&#x27;s a natural boar bristle brush so it&#x27;s awesome for fly aways and smoothing pony tails. It ALSO has nylon pins in it that are great for detangling and brushing long hair while it&#x27;s down. I&#x27;ve created both up do&#x27;s and down looks using this brush and since I&#x27;ve received it I&#x27;m using it everyday.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush! Almost feels like a scalp massage when I use it. My daughters hair is almost to her waist and she loves how easy it combs through her hair. HIGH quality brush! The curved design makes so much sense!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, that can tend towards frizziness. I love this brush. It feels good on my scalp, works well on thick hair, and makes my hair smoother and more shiny. I will probably buy more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> Just back from a cruise and out of my own shower where&#x27;s my brush?  It&#x27;s still packed, But...  What came while we were gone?  My detangling brush, that&#x27;s what and it was just in the next room.  Got it...  The first pass through my hair and I thought I&#x27;d missed my hair it went through so smooth.  Did my whole head, no cussing, no why is my hair so tangled, just smooth.  Almost no hair in brush.    It works.  Works real well.  Highly recommend!    This review is for Best Detangling Hair Brush: Multi-height Bristles and Staggered Rows Unravel Tangled Hair.  I&#x27;ll try to move it to the correct place...</li>
    <li> I am in love with my new brush!  I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so great but it is like a magic brush for my fine thin hair.  I have many, many hair brushes including three Mason Pearson brushes that I love but none of them make me scalp tingle like this one does.  It gently glides through my hair leaving it looking fuller and so shiney!  My scalp loves it too.  Just buy one.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical. As a busy mom of two little ones, there are days that a brush doesn&#x27;t quite make it through my hair and I rock a pony tail or messy bun. Usually after a day without brushing, it becomes impossible to brush after washing. This brush completely blew me away. It gloss right through my tangles without pulling or creating more of a mess. I&#x27;m VERY impressed!</li>
    <li> I Love this brush, it works wonderfully.  It&#x27;s great for my long hair and it molds itself right to my head! Amazing brush)</li>
    <li> I got a chance to try this brush and I am so happy with it. I have thick, wavy hair so it&#x27;s hard to find a brush that detangles it and smoothes it so it doesn&#x27;t look like a rats nest. This brush does both. I love that i can get my hair straightened out and styled without having to use a straightening iron if I don&#x27;t have the time. It isn&#x27;t shedding and the tops of the pins are still intact. The brush is really well-made and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine wavy hair that I prefer to wear almost straight. This brush is the best I have found for gripping my hair just enough while blow drying that I only have to touch up small sections with a flat iron. It gives really good lift at the roots, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and one time it was in the shower to detangle-it was not pretty. I think this might work better on straight hair(?).I have chemically processed and ethnic hair so that might be part of the issue. I haven&#x27;t used it yet to blow-out but will update when I do. Great customer service on behalf of the seller which is why I gave it an additional star.    Update 11/6/2014  I&#x27;ve used it several times now(dry hair) and it works very well. It does leave my hair shiny and does not break my hair. Happy overall.</li>
    <li> I love this brush when my hair is dry. I have extremely long curly, thick hair so when it&#x27;s wet this brush didn&#x27;t work but I still love it! If you&#x27;re looking for a brush that will comb out your tangles because you have thick curly hair like mine, this is not the brush for you but it is still worth it for dry hair. The bristles are soft and they feel good on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, course, heavy hair and a sensitive scalp. My hair is so thick that normal boat hair bristle brushes don&#x27;t even make it through the top layer of my hair--and it seemed like I was brushing with a ping pong paddle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t shampoo as often as I like because my hair becomes a frizzy ball of craziness and my scalp gets dry and itchy when I shampoo too often. It&#x27;s one of the joys of living in Colorado; altitude means everything dries out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush stimulates my scalp and spreads the oil from my roots to the ends at the same time. The curve of the brush means that I&#x27;m not just pulling hard in one area of my hair and barely touching another. My roots don&#x27;t get as oily and the brush slides right through. Because of this brush, my hair isn&#x27;t like Preacher in Serenity/Firefly after I brush it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a message warning me that the bristles may get a little bent in shipping. Two were, but they straighted out after a couple of days. I could have used needle nosed pliers to do it, but I didn&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it you have hair like mine, which is enough hair for three heads, get this brush.</li>
    <li> I have hair to my mid back and this brush untangles it effortlessly and leaves it really soft. My husband and daughter also love it.</li>
    <li> We love this brush I have twins with very long and full body hair, my daughters use to try to avoid me when it was time for brushing their hair (mommy is easier) not any more this brush is great absolutely would buy again</li>
    <li> Pretty effective! My hair looks longer and shines!</li>
    <li> This brush is the best brush I have ever used.  It goes through my long, fine hair without tugging and or pulling on it.  My hair actually looks better and feels better after I use this brush.  I would definitely recommend this to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I love the way this brush fits the shape of my head.  Dry hair: The bristles are short and hold the hair through the brush stroke,  As a result, my thin hair looks fuller.Wet hair:  I had to learn how to blow dry my hair using this brush, because it is really big. It made my short bob smooth, but it was hard to get lift at the roots.  The size is not travel friendly, and it does not fit into my purse.That is why I gave it four stars, instead of five. If this were slightly smaller, I would be able to give it five stars.</li>
    <li> Great quality!  I purchased 2 of these brushes to keep my daughters from taking mine out of my bathroom!</li>
    <li> An amazing brush. A few bristles were bent, but that didn&#x27;t really affect the experience of using this brush. Love the ergonomic design. Shaped to fit the head and has a comfortable grip. Definitely recommend it to anyone with difficult to manage hair.</li>
    <li> I got this brush for myself, but my husband, who has curly, dry, coarse hair&lt;br /&gt;  quickly confiscated it for himself.  Don&#x27;t know yet  how well it will work&lt;br /&gt;to correct his problem hair, but he loves the mechanics of it especially the&lt;br /&gt;shape.  I guess I will have to get myself another one(he guards this one&lt;br /&gt;like a dog with a new bone) .  I have fine more oily hair that I think will&lt;br /&gt;benefit from some aeration and scalp stimulation, so I am looking forward to&lt;br /&gt;the $10.00 discount coupon for a second purchase.  Thank you so much in&lt;br /&gt;advance for this opportunity.  Pat</li>
    <li> I love boar brushes, but this one just took it over the top, the boars with the bristles and pins o the end glide gently through your hair. It has always been hard for me to find the right brush due to my thick hair , but this one tops them all. Will not go back to another brush, it fits to the hand nicely and goes smoothly through my hair . My son also loves it.</li>
    <li> This brush FEELS so great to use.  I have fine hair that&#x27;s prone to tangling, and this brush glides right through and manages a nice scalp massage on its way.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as a full boar&#x27;s hair brush as far as redistributing oils, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The open-vent style of the paddle made it quick for blow-drying!</li>
    <li> love how soft my hair is after using this!!</li>
    <li> Great brush for blowdrying! I love Vizeri brushes.  They&#x27;re great quality and work fantastic.</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent. It feels great on the scalp. My hair is pretty long, down to middle of my back and kinda frizzy. I have to get Brazilian blowouts to tame It goes through  my hair with ease and leaves it feeling silky but not staticky. Even when my hair is wet it goes through with no trouble. It is lightweight and the vents help my hair dry quickly. Love this brush , worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews, but it ain&#x27;t all that.  It&#x27;s a decent brush if your hair is not very thick.</li>
    <li> a great brush! I love how it curves to fit the shape of your head. takes tangles away and helps distribute the oils of my hair evenly. totally worth the money!!</li>
    <li> This works amazing on my hair ! It is super thick and curly and I am so happy to have this delta fling awesome brush , makes my life a lot easier :)</li>
    <li> There should also be a smaller version for travel! 👍</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick yet fine, easily tangled hair.  She also has sensory issues which make detangling a tearful challenge.  She LOVES this brush!  She is now brushing her hair multiple times each day!  It&#x27;s a near miracle!</li>
    <li> Although I love the shampoo and conditioner from Vizeri, this brush left me underwhelmed. It feels as though it flattens my hair, even though the materials that it&#x27;s made of are excellent. It might be a fabulous brush if you have very heavy hair, which I do not any more.</li>
    <li> Ok so I literally got this brush 30 minutes ago. And being a mom of 3. You dont get much time fix your self up. I used this comb just now and Wow. Not only does it feel amazing while brushing your hair. It&#x27;s given my hair much needed volume that I haven&#x27;t seen in a while.  With no effort at all. I&#x27;m asian w very thick black hair. It was much thicker before my kids. But hair loss is unfortunately apart of the package once you have kids. My point is w my hair being straight I can&#x27;t get volume unless I blow dry my hair w a round comb. This this brush all I did was comb my hair the usual way. Once done combing I part my hair in is usual spot. And wow. It looks like I spend half an hr styling it. Overall I&#x27;m really happy I got this brush.</li>
    <li> Love it! This brush works really nice on my hair.</li>
    <li> The nylon bristol toppers did not hold up. I have been using it daily for a couple wks now.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!!!!! By far my favorite brush ever. It is also the best brush that I have ever had. I have crazy frizzy, damaged hair, and it tamed it with a couple brushes unlike any brush I have used before. It also feels amazing when I brush my hair unlike any brush that I&#x27;ve used before. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush that easily detangles hair &amp; leaves it feeling smooth &amp; looking shiny. I took off one star because it doesn&#x27;t reach the scalp with very thick hair. The rounded shape assures a nice scalp massage as long as your hair isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
    <li> I love my new brush. I have very wavy hair, shoulder length, that I sometimes style in a curly style. Other times I will straighten it and have a more straight look. I see that the brush is able to go through my curls when I need to massage my scalp. I see that it goes thru my hair easily does not damage my hair.  I enjoy the scalp massage that the brush provides each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; I will be getting one for my mother who has a very bad a problem with her scalp in that I believe that the use of this brush will help stimulate hair growth and rejuvenate her scalp.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many boar hair brushes for up to almost $100; and this one beats them all. The curved design and the large size is great. Some of the other boar hair brushes were too small at 4 times the price. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Man this brush feels so good I can brush my hair all day long until my hair falls out and then I will keep brushing my scalp because it feels that good and then I will use the wad of hair to make a pin cushion because hair makes a great pin cushion because it oils the pins and makes them easy to use whew I think I&#x27;ll have another drink of Bai5 natural energy drink.</li>
    <li> I have been using Boars Hair Brush for a week and my hair has changed more and more shinny!&lt;br /&gt;Since I work at a beauty salon, it is important for me to keep my hair shinny and beautiful not only as a woman but as work environment.&lt;br /&gt;I use Boars Hair Brush when brushing before going to bed and blowing dry my hair in the morning. This brush is very unique and makes my hair style easier with no tangle at all!&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair and always have to try to volume up using spray. But this brush  gives me volume around the top!&lt;br /&gt;I like its’ curve of the brush because it fits my head perfectly and easy to massage when I brush my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and would like to order for my daughter !&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied this brush and wished I had known this long time ago!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! This Brush is Better Than I Could Ever Have Imagined! This Brush Is So Relaxing to My Scalp and I Also Notice An Improvement To The Vibrancy to My Hair As Well. I Recommend This Brush Wholeheartledly.</li>
    <li> This brush is very comfortable to use.  It is quite large which took me a few tries to get used to, but I love it now.&lt;br /&gt;My hair after 3 weeks of use is much shinier.  Hard to believe, really.  I never tried boars hair before, it does work.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love this brush.  It passes through the hair with ease.  Easy to use and really made a difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working very well on long hair that is very difficult to comb because of tangling</li>
    <li> I have hair that is half wavy and half straight. This brush evens out the texture so I don&#x27;t look like a fool when I don&#x27;t have time to straighten it all (which is almost all of the time, considering how thick my hair is). I also shed a lot, and I feel like the boar bristles remove most of the loose strands so I&#x27;m not coming away with a handful every time I touch my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curved brush fits my head perfectly, btw. It feels really nice, like a head massager.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this brush!  It hugs my head and thoroughly brushes my thick, fine hair!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair, and this brush works really nice on my hair.  The only drawback I have is that it is a little too wide for me, maybe because my hair is short right now, but it feels really nice on my head.</li>
    <li> Great brush.  The vents allow for blow dryer air to blow all the way through the hair.  Keeps static at bay and the curvature is comfortable against the scalp.</li>
    <li> Bought the brush two weeks back&lt;br /&gt;I have thinning hair and this brush works perfectly&lt;br /&gt;My wife also uses it and loved it&lt;br /&gt;The curve and the shape is excellent</li>
    <li> I really like this brush and am happy with the purchase, especially for the price. I have two minor issues. Sometimes it is difficult to get it all of the way through my thick hair. Also, it makes my hair fill with static. The longer I have it, the less this seems to happen, but when I first got it, I thought that I might not be able to use it because it was so bad.</li>
    <li> I love the brush. It&#x27;s been perfect so far and I have no complaints and have been using the Moroccan oil with it, as recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave feedbacks, ever!  But I had to with this one.  I have longer hair with lots of layers.  Also, a hairdressers worst nightmare as I have a LOT of hair and a super sensitive scalp!  I received this yesterday and tried it this morning.  WOW!  I always have to use my chi flat iron after I blow dry because of waves in the back and weird flyaway strands.  I was scared it would pull my hair and cause my eyes to water and it doesn&#x27;t at all!  It&#x27;s so freaking soft!  And the curved shape is amazing!  I brushed underneath and used the hairdryer to flow with it, like my hairdresser does.  I&#x27;m totally flabbergasted because I didn&#x27;t even have to use my flatiron!  Never would I leave my hair down just after a blowdry and it literally looks as though I straightened it!  I can&#x27;t stress enough that this brush is the best thing EVER for hair!  You will not be disappointed in this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. It reminds me of one I had growing up. I like the boar bristles. It allows you to control the most coarse hair and it detangles pretty well too.</li>
    <li> I love it, it really does help my hair stay nice so that I can wash every other day! I just wish the boar bristles didn&#x27;t fall out as much as they do but I would definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a new brush in a long time.  This is really nice.  Love the unique shape.  The bristles feel really nice on the scalp. My hair is really long and I didn&#x27;t have a hard time getting through tangles.</li>
    <li> I really like this uniquely shaped brush and feel it is gentle on my hair and helps me keep it manageable without damaging it.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for any type of hair! This helps me detangle my hair. It is quick and easy! the shape and bristles are well made! This brush will last for a long period of time! I would recommended this brush to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This brush and so lightweight. I love the way the brush curves to my head. My curly hair seems to look better since I&#x27;ve started using this brush.</li>
    <li> I lost a lot of hair in recent years (aging?). I heard if you message your scalp and brush your hair more often, you will have more healthy hairs. That&#x27;s why I bought this brush. So far so good. I can feel it&#x27;s message my scalp when I brush my hair. Thanks for this product.</li>
    <li> I love this brush . It feels amazing on my scalp,and also helps with the static in my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! The unique shape of the paddle contours to my scalp and feels really nice. The boar bristles add a beautiful, healthy shine without needing to add extra product. The nylon pin bristles glide right through the teasing that I add to my hair without pulling. I have never owned a brush that I liked this much.&lt;br /&gt;Also, Vizeri Beauty has incredible customer service! So nice to deal with a company that personally cares that you are happy and satisfied with their product. I highly recommend that if you buy this brush and have any issues at all that you contact them. They really will listen and help you!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite brush I use it on my 5 yr old does pull her hair</li>
    <li> I have ordered six of these brushes in the last 60 day. First order, One for myself; the next order was two, one for my travel bag and one for my husband; the third order, one for my husband&#x27;s travel bag and two for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;We really love these brushes.  The feel of the brush sliding through your hair is amazing. The smoothness and shine of your hair after brushing is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;We are both thin haired blonde/grey.(both over age 60) My hair is long to mid back while my husbands is 2 to 3 inches that he styles back over the crown of the head.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes work their magic for both of us.  Thank you so much for designing this marvelous hair styling tool.</li>
    <li> Best hair brush I&#x27;ve ever found (and I&#x27;m old!)  Feels great.  Does not create static in my hair!</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  This is probably the best brush I have ever had.  At first when I opened it I was thinking it was too big, but boy was I wrong.  It is just perfect for the scalp in width and shape.  I&#x27;ve had boar bristle brushes before and they don&#x27;t seem to penetrate my thick hair.  Now that I keep my hair very short, the nylon pin brushes just don&#x27;t do a thing for my scalp.  But you put those two together in one brush and it just feels right.  I highly recommend this brush no matter what type of hair you have.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush !!!!!!!!!!!  I have long thick fine hair, it has thinned over the years, but this brush goes right through it without any tangles or snares! It also feels great to the scalp. No digging or scraping! I also have Rheumatoid Arthritis and it so easily fits in my hand and practically does the work itself! I am going to purchase one for each of my girls for Christmas, as they and their girls have long very thick hair too ! This brush is well worth the money and I wish I had found it years ago !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like giving your self a scalp massage.  I love this brush.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with the quality! We use it every single day!</li>
    <li> Favorite brush of all time!! Feels like a scalp massage while providing extra body to my hair. Wanted to buy another but they are sold out!!</li>
    <li> The Vizeri brush is so good that I ordered another one to give to a friend.  It gets through thick hair, worked wonderfully with a dryer, and keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking.  It’s a great brush.</li>
    <li> Absolutely best brush I&#x27;ve ever used!  Love it. Was trying to find the right brush for a long time, this one is it. I&#x27;ve recently begun using Argan oil, and really appreciate the downloadable product info in conjunction with using Argan oil. Will not hesitate to promote and recommend. I must change this review to reflect the fact that an entire row of bristles broke and fe out of this brush. Regular brushing as usual and the row snapped out, the brush is now rendered useless because it does not cover the area of hair being brushed, properly. Now I have to begin a hunt for a replacement. Is it too much to ask for a product that will last longer than a few months. I have my grandmother&#x27;s Fuller Brush from the 60&#x27;s, it&#x27;s still in mint condition!  I bought this new brush to give my vintage Fuller a rest, but sadly the brush is broken. I&#x27;m going to Fuller site now to see what they offer now, clearly their brush from over 50 years ago is far superior to this one. Will search for a brush at Fuller or somewhere else. UPDATE 1/13/15 - Rows &amp; bristles fell out!  I&#x27;m now on the hunt for a brush again. It&#x27;s disappointing, just when I thought I&#x27;d found a good one, this brush fell apart.  It was good while it lasted, it should have given more use than the time I used it and the amount of time it took for the rows to snap off and fall apart buy at your own risk!</li>
    <li> I love it.  I wish you had a round one (3&amp;#34;) to blow dry and several small ones that fit in a tiny purse (8&amp;#34; or less).  Would make great Christmas gifts men or women!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this Boar Bristle Brush. Works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  No more tangles in her hair. Plus it seems to give hair more of a shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Was not to sure of the size but it if wonderful</li>
    <li> In the past six months, I&#x27;ve probably ordered 5 brushes in the hunt for something is easy to hold, soft on tangles, and helps with the drying process. I found all this and more with this brush. I absolutely LOVE it! The curved paddle allows you to brush a lot more hair at once, plus it&#x27;s much more comfortable on my head. It brushes my hair so softly and smoothly with no pulling or tugging. My hair also dries twice as fast, which is a blessing with my thick hair, but his brush would be great for those with thin/fine hair, too, since it&#x27;s so gentle. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> Searched for a boar bristle brush before deciding on this one... Glad I did!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING, I have natural hair and this brush works wonders! It is very sturdy and strong compared to some of the brushes I Have used. It&#x27;s like having a paddle brush but not having to worry about it coming apart. The bristles are strong enough to tame my 4C hair. Love it Love it Love it, I have used it everyday since I got it!</li>
    <li> Holy mother of pearl! This may be the best brush I have found. I have at least 8 brushes in my house, 7 don&#x27;t cut it. This brush is amazing. I have  fine, oily hair and this doesn&#x27;t rip it out. Comfortable to use and very snazzy looking.</li>
    <li> Vizeri hair brushes are awesome.This is my second Vizeri brush purchase,I love the first one,so wanted to try this one too.  This brush works wonderful on my long hair,the brush actually felt like it was made to fit my head.It did not pull or rip my hair,as other brushes do when brushing through long very thick hair.I used it the first time right after I shampooed my hair, when my hair seems to be at its knottiest.The brush seemed to glide right thru those snarls,I was amazed at how easy it went through my hair.I like the curved brush head which has different sizes of the boar bristles.The handle fit in my hand well ,is one piece and grips well.I will always purchase your brushes.</li>
    <li> I received this brush on December 4th expecting it to be a smaller brush. I was surprised at how it is almost the size of a paddle brush and the shape is awesome. It truly glides over your whole scalp and feels like a massage.My hair is soo soft after brushing it too. With the boars hair, it makes it a lot easier to evenly distribute my Dove oil or Argan Oil, which ever I am using that day. I highly recommend this brush to anyone!! I am going to order a couple for gifts this Christmas!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I received it quickly. The packaging was easy to deal with and I appreciated that it was no frills. As for the brush its self. I have a lot of ultra fine curly hair. I sought this brush out because I had been dealing with sebum build up but had trouble getting regular boar bristle brushes all the way though my hair. This brush is a good compromise. It helps distribute my natural oils but also gets through my hair well. It detangles and leaves my hair shiny. It is also great at taming fly aways when styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This brush is great at getting the tangles out of my daughter&#x27;s hair without hurting her head!</li>
    <li> My husband and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this brush! We love love  how it&#x27;s curved and matches the shape of our heads. It works very well with his fine,thinning hair as well as my thick naturally curly hair. It is certainly a step up from any other brush we&#x27;ve had in the past since their shapes do not conform to one&#x27;s head. Yours feels so good when it runs through our hair.Best of all, it is moderately priced!</li>
    <li> Feels like heaven on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have curly thick hair so I was not sure if this brush would work well. I LOVE this brush and I will be purchasing 3 more of other family members. My 16 yr son has a very tender head and he was surprised that the brush worked well on his head. I recommend this brush to anyone, as the statement is true that this works on all types of hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kinda liking this brush a lot so far.  It does seem to be almost a detangling brush since I can actually get it through my night-tangled locks from top to bottom in one go.  Have never been able to do that with a regular brush.  I&#x27;m not seeing the benefit yet of the boar bristles spreading the oils throughout my hair but it&#x27;s nice not tugging at the hair.  I wish the plastic bristles were a bit longer - maybe another 1/8 to 1/4 inch - since I have very thick curly hair and I do enjoy a good scalp massage a good brush can give.  The book they emailed after purchase was also very interesting. Will be on the lookout for pure Argan oil, vs stuff I&#x27;m using now.  Did I mention my husband&#x27;s been stealing it out of my bathroom vanity drawer?  2 fans in this household.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for stocking stuffer gifts.  They absolutely loved&lt;br /&gt;the brushes.  They loved the design and the how easy they were to use to&lt;br /&gt;style their hair with.  Absolutely a great brush!  Loved how the hair&lt;br /&gt;looked after using the brush!</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and needed a hairbrush that would comb through my hair and this brush does that. It&#x27;s a lightweight brush and the bristles are soft, yet they still reach my scalp.</li>
    <li> This brush was amazing for the first week I had it.  My hair was beautifully glossy and smooth.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  After the first week, it just worked like any other brush.  None of the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; from the first week.  I tried picking out all my hairs from the brush and rinsing it under water, but it didn&#x27;t help.  Is there something else I&#x27;m supposed to be doing to maintain it?  I wish I knew...</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best brush I have ever had.  To be honest my daughter and her future husband both are planning to buy this brush, they agree with me it is wonderful.  I randomly seem to be brushing my hair now and it feels fabulous.  I love the way it is shaped to your head.  I recommend this brush and plan to get more for my loved ones. Thank you, Christi Bieker PS.  My Grandmother now wants one of these brushes.  Do you have info on older hair?</li>
    <li> I love this brush easy to use when drying my hair</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how well this brush works.  I have been using natural shampoos, shampoo bars, homemade concoctions, and the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method for a year, and I like my naturally curly hair better now, but I still had to use gel to keep it from being really frizzy, and it was always dry.  After using this brush for three days, I am sold.  My hair is soft, shiny, and nearly frizz-free.  I don&#x27;t have to use gel anymore.  Amazing. My itchy scalp is also gone.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I&#x27;ve used a Denman brush for the last 20 years, and didn&#x27;t think there would be a brush I liked more. I&#x27;ve had a few bristles fall out while pulling hair out of the brush, but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> I love the brush! I love that it is curved, my hair dries faster when I brush it, and my hair overall feels healthier and thicker! :)</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter and she loves it.  Her hair is thick/wavy and she likes the tip feature.  I like boar hair brushes so we found this brush satisfied both of our requirements on features a good brush should have.  The curved design was also a great feature.</li>
    <li> My daughter is bi-racial, with loose to tight curls depending on the humidity level. She&#x27;s three years old, and hair brushing time was turning into a much unwanted event. This brush has made brushing her hair less of an ordeal. No tears, no complaints. I can brush her hair when it&#x27;s wet or dry. Highly recommend. I only wish it was a little bit smaller as her head is little people size.</li>
    <li> I actually look forward to brushing my hair now that I have this brush.</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviews stated if you don&#x27;t have thick or voluminous hair, your hair won&#x27;t automatically get brushed by the boars bristles. But if you remember that you can make sure to brush in such a way that your hair makes contact with the bristles. The brush is nice for blow drying but hasn&#x27;t given me the benefits I had heard about regarding boars bristle brushes.</li>
</ol>
