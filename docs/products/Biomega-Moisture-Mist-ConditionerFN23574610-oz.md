<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biomega for a while.  I decided to try the moisture mist.  I will be using this daily for now on.  A few sprays go a long way.  It leaves my hair feeling conditioned.  I wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff.  I am the laziest person when it comes to &#x27;girl stuff&#x27; (sometimes I can&#x27;t be bothered to comb my hair properly) but ever since my sis (a hairdresser) bought this for me I can&#x27;t live without it.  I have wavy mid length hair that looks like Crusty the Clown&#x27;s hair by the end of the day and this helps immeasurably if I have somewhere to go and don&#x27;t want to scare small children.&lt;br /&gt;Have tried to cheap out and buy something similar in drug or grocery stores but unfortunately, there IS nothing similar.  I live in a big east coast city and cannot find it anywhere, not even in a salon or Sally Beauty store.  Biomega needs to expand their marketing!</li>
    <li> Everything about my hair has changed since using this product. I was growing it out after a bad dye job and short cut, and was told to use this every day after I shower. I will never stop using it. I get so many compliments on how healthy my hair looks now. Love it.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and not very thick.  This product is great!  Gives my hair a shine and makes it appears much thicker than it is.</li>
    <li> This stuff does wonders for my hair. I have brittle and fine blonde hair. This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find good hair products without parabens for the last year, and it hasn&#x27;t been easy with my fine, thin hair. I love this stuff. My hair gets conditioned without weighing it down. I&#x27;ve seen a good positive change to my hair. I use the mist along with the volume shampoo.</li>
    <li> Good quality, fast shipment.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the only hair \\&quot; sauce\\&quot; we have found to get through a little girl&#x27;s very curly hair.... And she never crys. She likes it ....</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I loved it for the few days I had it, my daughter decided she liked it too - so it is in her bathroom now.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t praise this highly enough. The smell is amazing. It is tough on detangling but not at all heavy on your hair when it dries. My hair gets really tangly so I still use a tiny bit of conditioner in the shower and then spray this into my hair when it&#x27;s damp to brush it out. At first I wished this wasn&#x27;t so expensive ($15 for conditioner is more than I usually spend), but honestly, because it&#x27;s a mist and not straight conditioner, this has lasted me over a month already and it&#x27;s not even feeling close to empty yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it, I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have medium length hair which stayed tangled constantly &amp; frizzy. I was about to give up &amp; chop off my hair when my beautician introduced this product to me. I also use the shampoo &amp; conditioner of this brand. If you want soft, manageable hair, this is THE  product. Removes tangles, use on wet or dry hair, is a very light mist...doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. I don&#x27;t use much conditioner in my hair since I found this!</li>
    <li> You will love this product (but it is hard to find).  My granddaughter has a very sensitive scalp and extremely fine hair that easily tangles.  I have tried every conditioner product available and it was still a battle until I found Biomega.  It is fantastic and works well on wet or dry hair.  Combs and brushes go right through the tangles with no problem and leaves her hair so fresh and tangle free.  It smells fantastic too.  No build up - no oil - it&#x27;s a miracle.  I use it too instead of conditioning after shampoos - its just wonderful.  I have had so many people ask me where they can find it.  I highly recommend this product (fantastic for children with hard to comb hair).</li>
    <li> I love Aquage products, but this one is just okay.  It does not do anything for my hair.  It is not sticky and smells good, but I was expecting it to keep the frizzies down and add some shine.</li>
    <li> Smells great just not very conditioning. I have long hair with some curl to it and my hair still feels dry. It doesn&#x27;t help detangle my girls hair either. I will be looking for something else. Finding a spray without a lot of ingredients hard.</li>
    <li> This product will make your hair feel baby soft and truly does NOT weigh hair down.  I love Aquage products.</li>
    <li> My dry damaged (bleached) hair loves this leave in conditioner. Smooth and shiny after I use it. My old hairdresser turned me on to this product line.</li>
    <li> Yes it did. But when I received it was frozen and had leaked and was all over the outside of bottle</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry from keeping all that gray covered up!  This product works great and makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
    <li> I have a thick head of baby fine hair, color treated. This is the only product that takes tangles out, does not make my head itch and also has a pleasant smell. It also protects hair when blowdrying. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It makes my curly hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff, it keeps your hair looking healthy even if you color it.  I&#x27;m a product junkie and by a lot of stuff I give away or don&#x27;t use.  Not this, I can&#x27;t imagine not ever using it now.</li>
    <li> wonderful moisture for the day after a wash. Service was great</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using the Biomega Moisture Mist Conditioner, this leave-in spray condition works well with the Aquage Seaextend Strengthening Essentials Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Used this and now have shiny hair for first time in decades!!  Would recommend to anyone unhappy with their hair appearance.</li>
    <li> I have very fine are and it is hard to find something that does not weight it down but, this works great</li>
    <li> Love it....I always order this! It&#x27;s the best spray-in condition I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;It may be a little pricey but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair and this conditioner works really well. Not one of those heavy conditioners that weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> This product is changing my life.  I have fine blonde hair that, thanks to delayed trims, tangles easily.  I was mistakenly trying to correct the problem by over conditioning, which left my hair dull and limp.  To correct I would do a vinegar rinse.  My new hair stylist recommended this product.  It truly is fantastic for my fine hair.  It gets rid of the tangles and actually looks full, with volume that I have never seen before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only wish is that it was a PRIME product.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product for fine, limp or thin hair.  It provides conditioning w/out heaviness or weighing down hair.</li>
    <li> I have colored, highlight and lowlight, short and fine hair.  A product junky, always looking for something that will help improve my hair.  Found this on amazon and decided to try after I purchased the volume biomega shampoo.  SO GLAD I got this product.  I use it different, either after I shampoo and condition before bed, or after I shampoo only in the morning before I add product and start heat styling (usually round brush).  After just a few days I noticed a difference in the texture and strength of my hair.  And it seems to get better throughout the day when have this on under products and hair spray.  The smell is the best, it is a light weight product and smells like it feels.  Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Is not heavy weighing down your hair.  I love Biomega products.</li>
    <li> I love this light weight conditioner that can be left in and still will not weigh my down. Will definitely use again!</li>
    <li> It used to be a great product until someone decided to make it smell like @#%!..,what were they thinking. It still works great but who wants to smell like that ?!?</li>
