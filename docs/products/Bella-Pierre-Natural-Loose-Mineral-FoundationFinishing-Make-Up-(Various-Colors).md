      <li>I prefer this over the Bare Mineral foundation because the coverage is so much better</li>

      <li>I can get away with one application for a normal day, but if I am working or going out in the evening</li>
      <li>It is very soft and not cakey on my face.</li>
      <li>Looks so natural and yet covers everything.</li>
      <li>Same high quality product that I&#x27;ve come to expect from Bella Pierre .</li>
      <li>I was a fan of Bare Minerals...until I discovered Belle Pierre.  </li>
      <li>The color ordered was consistent to the color previously purchased at a Bella Pierre kiosk that no longer exists.</li>
      <li>bought from kiosk previously and this does not seem to be the same product nor exactly the same color.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for years. I never thought I would find it again. Just by chance I thought I&#x27;d look it up on line, OMG I couldn&#x27;t believe it! This product works great. It gives just enough coverage. perfect.</li>
    <li> I used to work at Bella Pierre Cosmetics, and have been hooked on this mineral makeup ever since! It&#x27;s light on your face and so far I have not had any skin irritation because of this makeup. (I have been using it for about 3 years)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this for all skin types!</li>
    <li> Best makeup I have ever used. Doesn&#x27;t leave that fake or sticky look of liquid foundation. Looks so natural and yet covers everything.</li>
    <li> I was a fan of Bare Minerals...until I discovered Belle Pierre.  This product lasts way longer--both on your face and on your shelf. It goes on very evenly and does an excellent job of creating a smooth, flawless look. I&#x27;m now back on Amazon, happily ordering my second foundation purchase...in Nutmeg. Bravo!</li>
    <li> Very good deal. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I prefer this over the Bare Mineral foundation because the coverage is so much better and it lasts all day.</li>
