<li> Expensive and really didn&#x27;t make my daughter&#x27;s hair shine all that much.  </li>
<li> I have grey hair</li>
<li> You can imagine how dry and brittle my hair became after all that bleaching.</li>
<li> Amazon was half the price for the same amount of product.</li>
<li> I have very, very dry hair</li>
<li> The last product I used was made by TIGI and came in a small, dark blue, plastic spray bottle...</li>
<li> Just spray a little, then run the flat iron over it.  </li>
<li> This product makes your hair so shiny and silky and you a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I tried BedHead Headrush and was so grateful to discover that it tamed down fly-away, dry hair!!!!</li>
<li> Price is much less than hair salons.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t end up with an oily, greasy mess.  </li>
<li> If you never used this before you are missing out.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this because it did not create shine.</li>
<li> The spray Nozzle stopped working after the first use :-(  </li>
<li> I ordered this on a whim and was not sure what to expect.  </li>
<li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but my hair feels greasy after using it, and not particularly shiny either.  </li>
<li> I am not impressed.  </li>
