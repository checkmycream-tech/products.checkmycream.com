    <li> Omg....I love this soap. If switching soaps for the first time ladies keep in mind you can mess up your ph down there. Mix your old soap with the new for a few weeks so your body can adjust. This soap has a bit of a smell but  you can&#x27;t smell it on your skin at all. Gentle, cleansing, non drying. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Great product, without added chemicals.  EWG recommends it .</li>
    <li> I love the soap, makes my skin smooth and comfortable, but I prefer the lavender scented bar.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re 6 bars in with this soap and very happy. It lasts a long time and is gentle on the skin. Aside from basic cleaning I use it to form a lather to shave my legs and it works great. I am allergic to most scented products and this is my favorite unscented soap. Please keep carrying it!</li>
    <li> Love it. Love it. Love it. Shea butter soap is the bestest! Soft on yer hands, and no gross perfumes. So much better than the Dove-type products spewed out from meh chemical companies &amp;#34;dedicated to your health and beauty&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love this soap its unscented and is very mild so I won&#x27;t have to worry about breakouts.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and easily irritated. I use this soap on my face and in the years since I&#x27;ve started using it, I have not had a serious breakout. When a pimple or other blemish does appear they are much smaller and only last a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;On top of that it&#x27;s a bar so it lasts basically forever. This is my second reorder and I last purchased this product in 2012.</li>
    <li> This soap is one of the best in regards to making skin feel hydrated and clean. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this soap it lasts such a long time. I use this soap once every three days so I skip two days in between showers. I have literally been using the same bar for about 5 months now. As long as you keep it in a dry place when it&#x27;s not being used it will last a long time and works very well :)</li>
    <li> 1st order was darker in color and long lasting;  2nd order was lighter in color and shorter lasting.  Makes one wonder if soap color makes a difference in productotherwise, great soap!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, solid bar</li>
    <li> This is a great unscented, non-toxic soap that leaves my skin soft. I shower daily and the soap bar lasts at least a month. It lathers nicely and does not leave a film residue after. It is reasonably priced as well. An additional plus is that the profits support a great cause. Everybody wins with this soap.</li>
    <li> Creamy and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin even during the winter. I especially like that it is pure and unscented and I don&#x27;t have any allergy issues with it. Sometimes it is hard to find in unscented so ordering it 6 at a time insures that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> The soap is OK. I like the scent. It is a bit drying, and I prefer my soaps to be both cleansing and moisturizing. It isn&#x27;t that bad, but I have used better. I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This soap is nice, but not for me I have sensitive skin. Dry my skin after  bathing, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Perfumed soaps make my skin itchy. This was a breath of fresh air. My skin felt clean but not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Made with great ingredients as well.</li>
    <li> Once out of the shower, my skin feels soft &amp; very smoothe before applying lotion</li>
    <li> I cannot tolerate fragrance in my soap, so this product was perfect for me.  Lathers nicely if you use a &amp;#34; bath scrunchie or sponge&amp;#34; - less lather if you just use a wash rag.</li>
    <li> As someone with sensitive skin, I have tried many, many different bars. Besides having a light but pleasant, un-scent, this bar stays hard not melting and turning gooey like other natural products. Also, my skin feels creamy, yet clean. I just love it and am so happy to have found it!</li>
    <li> This is the best soap among many to keep hands from drying out even in the winter wind chills. I especially like the unscented bars.</li>
    <li> Love the soap. Long lasting and truly unsecured.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap. It is not only unscented but of very high quality. My skin feels wonderful after using and I feel good knowing that it is made of only natural ingredients--no parabens for this girl!</li>
    <li> I love this bar soap, I have problems with lots of other soaps that leave me dry skin or itch.  This is wonderful, it&#x27;s a must bye</li>
    <li> love it  no strong smell  good lather and skin feels great</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this non toxic soap. Good stuff, non drying...</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  I get the&lt;br /&gt;unscented .&lt;br /&gt;It is very moisturizing and helps my skin</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to be so pleased with this soap. After all, it&#x27;s just soap, right? Turns out it&#x27;s so moisturizing that I hardly have to use any lotion anymore. I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower for just over a month, and the bar is only about half gone, so it&#x27;s an economical choice as well.</li>
    <li> I discovered this soap in Walgreen&#x27;s, but they no longer carry it.  It is gentle and non-drying because of the high shea butter content, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as many commercial products do.  I use it for face and body washing and as my shampoo because of my scalp sensitivity.  I lather it in my hands and then apply it to my hair--it works beautifully and does not strip my hair.  I was so happy to find this product on Amazon that I bought a number of bars.</li>
    <li> Update 4/22/14: Now has coconut oil in the ingredients list. No longer usable. What a shame! It used to be my GoTo soap.</li>
    <li> Lasts a good while but not near as moisturizing as I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Very nice and mild soap. Nearly odorless and does a great job of moisturizing. It lathers up nicely and lasts just as long as other soaps. I also like the size as it fits nicely in the hand</li>
    <li> Because having a lot of allergies to scents and chemicals I find this soap so welcoming. I just love it.</li>
    <li> Got it for husband who has eczema and very dry skin.  He said he really likes it.  It lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; like some other soaps.</li>
    <li> A very nice soap because its unscented  but still foamy . My baby has eczema  and i&#x27;ve heard shea butter form africa are great for the skin. It worked will on my baby&#x27;s skin because i was looking for unscented soap at the store and couldn&#x27;t find one .</li>
    <li> I love the scent and ingredients in this soap. It also aids my not so soft water and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. It has has a pleasant fragrance. The only downside is that it can be pricey but Amazon pricing made it a buy!</li>
