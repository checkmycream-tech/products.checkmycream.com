      <li>I think it&#x27;s a great product</li>
      <li>Great for styling my hair while drying.</li>
      <li>Great for combing out tangles as well as using with a dryer to style your hair.</li>
      <li>Despite that, it works just as good as the circular brush that I broke.  </li>
      <li>My favorite and very talented hairdresser turned me on to this brush many years ago!</li>
      <li>They are very light weight and feel great on my scalp, though.  </li>

      <li>So I got more.</li>
      <li>You should get more too.</li>
      <li>I bought this brush because I&#x27;ve used this type of brush for many years.</li>
      <li>I have never had a problem with static in my hair</li>

      <li>I just love this brush for my fine, tangly hair.  </li>

      <li>Handle could be more comfortable, but the brush works well with my fine hair</li>

      <li>It is also light weight, study and easy to keep clean.</li>
      <li>This is the only one that is truly static free and that feels good in hand.  </li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted!  </li>

      <li>I was 15 when I bought my first.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very durable and gives fullness to my hair.</li>
      <li>I found one at MarketPlace through Amazon and at the time it was the last one available.  </li>
      <li>When I accidentally left it behind at a hotel I was in a panic to find a replacement and was super happy when Amazon had it.  </li>
      <li>great brush, no static and is made very well so lasts long time</li>
      <li>and I think it cuts the static down.</li>
      <li>tunnels from high school twenty years ago just died.</li>
      <li>My favorite brush for the past 15 years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had Cricket brushes in the past, and they&#x27;ve always been my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I have used a Cricket vented brush for more years than I can remember and although I have bought other brushes in the past, I always go back to my Cricket.</li>

<li> The only problem is they tend to break where the handle meets the brush head after a few years.  </li>

<li> I bought one of these from this seller on Amazon, and about half of the tips were damaged when I bought it, so I had to throw it away.</li>
<li> and I was unable to find it in any of the stores.</li>

    <li> Love this brush.  Works great!</li>
    <li> My favorite and very talented hairdresser turned me on to this brush many years ago!</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush, but I don&#x27;t find it to be static free as advertised. It works no&lt;br /&gt;better at keeping my hair from flying away as any other brush I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s a nice&lt;br /&gt;brush otherwise however.</li>
    <li> Lives up to expectations. This brush is fine to sort out thick or matted hair, and is very very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!. Great price!. Great product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. I was 15 when I bought my first. Been using it for 26 years. Tried others over the years. Never worked, threw them away and went back to cricket. It is by far the best hair brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a brush... JUST THE BEST BRUSH EVER DESIGNED WHICH LASTS DECADES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tunnels from high school twenty years ago just died. So I got more. You should get more too.</li>

    <li> I love this brush. It truly is anti-static. It is also light weight, study and easy to keep clean. Great for combing out tangles as well as using with a dryer to style your hair.</li>

    <li> I bought this brush because I&#x27;ve used this type of brush for many years. It&#x27;s very durable and gives fullness to my hair. I will continue to purchase this brush in the future.</li>
    <li> I just love this brush for my fine, tangly hair.  When I accidentally left it behind at a hotel I was in a panic to find a replacement and was super happy when Amazon had it.  It did take FOREVER to ship though...only downside.</li>
    <li> I am ordering more for gifts.  Great for blow drying your hair (long or short) and for styling.  I think it&#x27;s a great product and I was unable to find it in any of the stores.</li>
    <li> I had a brush like this for years and needed a replacement.  I looked to buy one locally and even asked my hair stylist, but nobody could find one.... so I decided to look online.  I found one at MarketPlace through Amazon and at the time it was the last one available.  It was exactly what I wanted!  I am very pleased with the product, the delivery and the price.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I thought that it was a circular brush, but it is not.  Despite that, it works just as good as the circular brush that I broke.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I had this exact brush and used it every day for about 10 years when I noticed the little red tips were breaking and the sharp black spokes would probably cause hair damage. I bought one of these from this seller on Amazon, and about half of the tips were damaged when I bought it, so I had to throw it away. I did not take the time to try to get the situation remedied.</li>
    <li> I had this same brush years ago, but lost it. I have been trying to find another one since then. So glad to have found it on Amazon. I love the brush. Cricket makes great brushes.</li>
    <li> Handle could be more comfortable, but the brush works well with my fine hair and I think it cuts the static down.</li>
    <li> I had the same brush for years. The static free feature is great. My husband also uses one, even with his short hair.</li>
    <li> Outstanding.  This brush works perfectly for me.  Other brushes never have worked as well.</li>

    <li> My favorite brush for the past 15 years.  I have 2 spares left.</li>
