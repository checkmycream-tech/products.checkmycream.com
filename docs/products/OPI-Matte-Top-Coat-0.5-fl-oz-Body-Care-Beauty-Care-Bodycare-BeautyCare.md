<li> OPI is my favorite polish brand, but this one disappointed me.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it starts to rub off within a couple of days</li>
<li> Probably stayed for a day and a half.</li>
<li> I have tried this over a few kinds of nail polish (OPI, Sally Hansen, Revlon, Rimmel, Nicole, &amp; Nails Inc.).  </li>
<li> Thus, unless I run out of nail polish remover,  this stuff is useless.</li>

    <li> Great product, it really is a matte top coat but it wears off after a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Good buy, good size for price.</li>
    <li> Mi daughter loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Work the way i thought  it would</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Matte Top Coat over acrylic nails.  It makes nails look natural...like they aren&#x27;t polished at all...but provides some nail protection.</li>
    <li> looks amazing over black &amp; also nude polish</li>

    <li> I requested a MATTE nail polish at the salon recently and discovered they use this product.  I was elated when I realized I could make any of my nail polish colors look matte with this top coat.  I think it&#x27;s going to make great stocking stuffers for Christmas!  My only complaint is that it starts to rub off within a couple of days so the ends of my nails are starting to look shiny again.</li>
    <li> Great customer satisfaction team! And I love the product!</li>
    <li> I am usually big fan of OPI nailed ducts. But OPI matte was just disappoint me. Nail polish start chipping of within 2 days. I will never order the matte again! I will stick with the regular top coat that stays for two weeks.</li>
    <li> Dried very quickly and lasted for a while! Make sure to cap your free edge and it won&#x27;t chip!</li>
