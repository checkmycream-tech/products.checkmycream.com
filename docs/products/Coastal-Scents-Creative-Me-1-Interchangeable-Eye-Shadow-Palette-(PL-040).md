      <li>Shipped fast, and the colors are bright, bold and playful.</li>
      <li>The color is very bright and the shadow stays on the eyelid well, especially when using a primer first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this palette it looks exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive the makeup I began to play in it</li>
      <li>( good quality )make up brushes make a big difference in any eyeshadow</li>
      <li>colors are so true to the palette.</li>
      <li>My only helpful review is that the packaging be more appropriate for the product.</li>
      <li>I do not have to do alot of \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; because the colors are so bold.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m learnimg a bunch with sooo many brand new Spring/Summer</li>
      <li>They are really worth the price.</li>
      <li>It was well worth the price</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>The eyeshadows are of very pigmented &amp; are true to color.  </li>
      <li>It was the exact one she wanted.</li>
      <li>It is most definitely a Must have!!!</li>
      <li>I am a dark complexion, black woman and this eye shadow is wonderful!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re an amateur with makeup (like me) it will take practice to get good with eye makeup.</li>
      <li>They are very blendable, and wash off easily with a facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>The photo really doesn&#x27;t do justice to the colors in this pallete, very vibrant colors ..</li>
      <li>It is very highly pigmented.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Anyone who knows makeup knows your primer is what can really make the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend for anyone who wants to brighten up there look</li>
      <li>and the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I really like these products</li>
      <li>Much building up needed for these.</li>
      <li>and I believe this really helps make the colors pop.</li>
      <li>came in a timely manner was packed very well, no damage at all.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid of bright colors!!!</li>
      <li>It went through the ringer for 12 hours straight at a Halloween event at a theme park.</li>
      <li>Im excited to see what i can create in the future.</li>
      <li>I wanted to go the high end route, but couldn&#x27;t stomach paying that much money for it.</li>
      <li>As I stated in the other review, this was shipped very quickly, and arrive as promised Very well packaged.</li>
      <li>Especially if this will be your first palette, or haven&#x27;t dabbled in high end makeup very much.   </li>
      <li>The colors are so vibrant and just pop against my milk chocolate skin.  </li>
      <li>dont expect them to work like a high end product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This palate easily stands up against my more expensive ones.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s hard to find a good red shade.</li>
      <li>It is not to pigmented but with a great base, like the NYX milk pencil you can make it as bold as you want.</li>
      <li>(it comes off a little light), but that&#x27;s me being picky.</li>
      <li>and it does close completely.</li>
      <li>you have some major competition!!</li>
      <li>On a positive note the wear is long lasting.</li>
      <li>Came as expected and was packaged very well.</li>
      <li>A couple of the shades are standout shades (brighter blue, hot pink, and the warm orange); the rest were a disappointment.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t stray away from high end brands but since I don&#x27;t always wear vibrant colors I wanted something cheaper.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Shipped fast, and the colors are bright, bold and playful. Some of those blues on the bottom are actually green. Colors last all day.</li>
    <li> The package came just as promised.  I read that some buyers received their product broken.  I did not.  It was packaged properly and the colors are very bright.  They are not as pigmented as I would&#x27;ve liked, but for the price they will work fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and it arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are so true to the palette. I always use eyelid primer and I believe this really helps make the colors pop. I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it. I also have CS&#x27;s fall festival palette and it&#x27;s beautiful as well.&lt;br /&gt;The right ( good quality )make up brushes make a big difference in any eyeshadow application.&lt;br /&gt;As a woman of color (dark skinned) these colors are fun, flirty and gorgeous on the eye. Works for a toned down day look or amped up night look. :)</li>
    <li> Well I received the makeup palette today, it came as expected. I was so excited to receive the makeup I began to play in it but to my surprise it wasn&#x27;t what i expected it to be. The pigment in the shadow is not what it appears out to be. Maybe I will try it using a primer and then see the result&#x27;s but as of now I&#x27;m not impressed.......</li>
    <li> Given as a gift to a teenager who wanted more colors to her makeup variety. She was thrilled with the variety.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting bright matte eyeshadow and had been researching the heck out of it. I wanted to go the high end route, but couldn&#x27;t stomach paying that much money for it. Coastal Scents had been on my radar, especially the 88 palettes, but the reviews have been so mixed. There seemed to be a honeymoon phase with the palette, where it swatched wonderfully, but after daily use the wonderful disappeared.  Even with the mixed reviews on Amazon about this palette (Creative Me #1), I decided to take the plunge and order it. I am happy to say I have not regretted my purchase. I&#x27;ve had this palette for about a month now, and I still love it.  If you&#x27;re an amateur with makeup (like me) it will take practice to get good with eye makeup. I&#x27;ve been watching youtube tutorials and practicing a lot. Do all of my looks come out awesome? I wish. So don&#x27;t fault the palette for your inexperience with techniques. If you manipulate this palette correctly, it will treat you well.  I added images to this product&#x27;s gallery-- a BEFORE and AFTER photo. I did not take it easy on my makeup. It went through the ringer for 12 hours straight at a Halloween event at a theme park. I also have a hooded eye plus oily lids. I did use [[ASIN:B004FMFD0Q Too Faced Cosmetics, Shadow Insurance Candlelight, 0.35-ounce]] as my eyeshadow primer. But after I took off my makeup the purple stained my eyelid a bit with red. This doesn&#x27;t bother me, though it may bother you. It just shows me it has staying power (hah).  In conclusion, if you&#x27;re on the fence about this palette I say go for it. Especially if this will be your first palette, or haven&#x27;t dabbled in high end makeup very much.   Don&#x27;t be afraid of bright colors!!!</li>
    <li> Bright and fun! use a white base to make them pop!</li>
    <li> I purchased this palette because it contained a red and I was told red pigments are not good for your eyes so it&#x27;s hard to find a good red shade. I&#x27;m not a fan of buying small individual shadows so I purchased Creative Me because of all of the bright colors and online it has good review. It&#x27;s great for very bright spring looks and the color pay off is great. It was well worth the price and the shipping was fast. The palette is constructed well meaning the mirror isn&#x27;t loose and it does close completely. The two greens look supremely similar, but they aren&#x27;t as close in color as I thought so I ended up liking them more then I thought I would.    The red isn&#x27;t as red as I would like (it comes off a little light), but that&#x27;s me being picky. I do recommend this product, the colors are amazing and they are easy to blend and work with.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows are of very pigmented &amp; are true to color.  The only downside is that the colors are quite \\&quot;BRIGHT\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;LOUD\\&quot; so it&#x27;s definitely NOT your  \\&quot;everyday wear\\&quot; @ the office.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this palette it looks exactly like the picture. The colors are very pigmented and beautiful I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Nice and pigmented, beautiful colors. Thank you very much!!!</li>
    <li> Love everything about this pallet</li>
    <li> I purchased this item along with the 42 Double Stack Matte Pallette. As I stated in the other review, this was shipped very quickly, and arrive as promised Very well packaged. As for the product itself, the colors are very bright and bold just as they look here or even better. They are very blendable, and wash off easily with a facial cleanser. I do not have to do alot of \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; because the colors are so bold.I really like these products and I have already have already placed another order!</li>
    <li> I am a dark complexion, black woman and this eye shadow is wonderful! It is very highly pigmented. I tested a little on my eyes without the primer, and the color was just like on the palette. Watch out MAC.....you have some major competition!! &#x3D;) Also, none of the colors were broken. The packaging was out of this world. Bubble wrap, after bubble wrap, after bubble wrap.....</li>
    <li> came in a timely manner was packed very well, no damage at all. the produce is wonderful.  Love this palette.  Packed with color.</li>
    <li> The colors you see on the palet is what shows on your face. I am of brown tones and my eyes didn&#x27;t absorb the color.</li>
    <li> very nice colors thanks</li>
    <li> pretty colors nice and easy to work with. they do have alot of fall out so be careful when using. they are great for the price. dont expect them to work like a high end product. i would totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> The photo really doesn&#x27;t do justice to the colors in this pallete, very vibrant colors .. I love 😍</li>
    <li> A couple of the shades are standout shades (brighter blue, hot pink, and the warm orange); the rest were a disappointment. Some shades needed to have a neutral base for them to appear. Much building up needed for these. If you&#x27;re on a budget then these are a good starter palette. If you have the means just get the Sugarpill palettes. They are really worth the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and vibrant colors!!! It is most definitely a Must have!!! It is not to pigmented but with a great base, like the NYX milk pencil you can make it as bold as you want.</li>
    <li> Coastal Scents is a great makeup product. But unfortunately when mine finally came in the mall a shadow was broken. As soon as I took the palette out of the box I immediately seen shadow powder on the outside of the bubble wrap packaging. &amp; to no surprise when I took it out &amp; opened it a shadow was broken. I debated on whether to send it back but decided to keep it since the other shades were intact. My only helpful review is that the packaging be more appropriate for the product. The seller may/may not have control over how roughly the product is shipped to the consumer. But with such a delicate product a simple &amp;#34;Handle With Care&amp;#34; sticker should be enforced for future services. On a positive note the wear is long lasting. Anyone who knows makeup knows your primer is what can really make the product. Once you have a good eyeshadow primer almost any eyeshadow will give you a great wear. I&#x27;m dark skin &amp; these colors come out perfect. I&#x27;d recommend for anyone who wants to brighten up there look</li>
    <li> These colors are greatly pigmented, surprisingly so since it is so affordable. I usually don&#x27;t stray away from high end brands but since I don&#x27;t always wear vibrant colors I wanted something cheaper. These blend beautifully, it does have high degree of fall down but just put your foundation on last.</li>
    <li> This color pallet is great! I absolutely love it!! The colors look great with or without, eye shadow primer, if your thinking about purchasing this case, its definitely worth it. Also lookup  (...) she does awesome eye makeup with this same palette! Hope u enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> coastal sects web site has this for 5 bucks way cheaper then what they sale it for 25 bucks over priced</li>
    <li> Came as expected and was packaged very well. item was given as a gift. It was the exact one she wanted.</li>
    <li> The colors are so vibrant and just pop against my milk chocolate skin.  Been using Youtube tutorials on Costal Scents palattes and I&#x27;m learnimg a bunch with sooo many brand new Spring/Summer looks with just those 12 colors.  I loved it so much, I bought the 120 palatte two, lol</li>
    <li> This palate easily stands up against my more expensive ones. The color is very bright and the shadow stays on the eyelid well, especially when using a primer first. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.. pigmented, gorgeous colors for those creative looks. Im excited to see what i can create in the future. :)</li>
    <li> This palette was very inexpensive, it arrived in good condition.  The colors are very bold and bright.  I plan to use a white color on my lids to make the colors pop!  Great summer palette!</li>
