      <li>Love this product.</li>

      <li>Love it  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>

      <li>So glad to be able to find it.</li>

      <li>I love this and have ordered it on amazon before</li>
      <li>Normally love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I miss it in stores, but glad I can still find it here.</li>
      <li>Glad I could find this.</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen, I love these products and I had to search the internet to find them because you stopped making them&lt;br /&gt;There  </li>
      <li>I love this discontinued item.</li>
      <li>its great.....much better than mineral veil.</li>
      <li>Smells so good and really does the job.</li>
      <li>but it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>For those with uneven skin attributes, this product is superb!  </li>
      <li>and they changed the original formula.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem like anything special</li>
      <li>This new product has a strong powdery-type fragrance I didn&#x27;t remember it having, and also has a chalky appearance when applied, but which does get better after having it on for awhile.  </li>
      <li>is business about loyalty to your customers like we are loyal to our brands.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very high quality and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, the formula for this once great oil absorbing powder changed--it not like the original.  </li>
      <li>This is such a simple product, but it is so good!</li>
      <li>I was excited when I saw this offered because I had read good reviews about it in the past</li>
      <li>, it is light and not heavy or cakey, and the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I really like this!</li>
      <li>and it never fails me.</li>
      <li>exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rimmel&#x27;s Stay Matte transparent powder for hourly (often more than that) touchups because it works the same as all these others but is cheaper.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many products to help with this- from urban decay to Peter thomas roth to smashbox to laura mercier to basic drugstore stuff and milk of magnesia...</li>
      <li>Within 20 minutes of applying \\&quot;my face\\&quot; the oil is evident, and within 40 minutes it looks like I went bobbing for apples in a tub of grease.</li>
      <li>the Original Cornsilk Shineless Natural Matte Pressed Powder</li>
      <li>I use a large brush with it and have no problem.  </li>
      <li>I have used loose powder before, but like this much better.</li>
      <li>so it was hard for me to find a good product.</li>
      <li>It really helps control shine, and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have the same fabulous results from this powder.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lighter than I really like.</li>
      <li>Thanks again for the sat ship and A++++ product.</li>
      <li>I really hope I can continue to buy this product</li>
      <li>Hard to find, works beautifully, hope they bring it back.</li>
      <li>The shade is not right and even the consistency is much more powderey.</li>
      <li>hope it is available for a long time.</li>
      <li>and I will definitely be returning for more in the future.</li>
      <li>I hope this enough to last me because I wont be able to get it any longer&lt;</li>
      <li>Looks very natural!</li>
      <li>The product is great, but difficult to find, and sometimes not cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I break out easy (even though I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s), and I have super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, this product does not seem the same as it used to be many, many years ago.  </li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s clear, so</li>
      <li>Natural product, with or without foundation.</li>
      <li>Completely gave my skin a matte, soft look.  </li>
      <li>It might actually work better than loose powder because I only loosen what I need and waste very littlle.</li>
      <li>I really wanted loose powder but ordered this in error.  </li>
      <li>I prefer it for several reasons: it covers well without adding color, it absorbs oil and keeps my skin clear</li>
      <li>The cost has jumped considerably now that you can only find it online.  </li>
      <li>It decreases shine but does not negatively impact dry areas.</li>
      <li>It helps a tad to mattify when first applied but in less than 20 minutes we&#x27;re back to an oil-slick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Glad I could find this.</li>
    <li> For those with uneven skin attributes, this product is superb!  It decreases shine but does not negatively impact dry areas.</li>
    <li> This is an &amp;#34;Ok&amp;#34; setting powder. It&#x27;s translucent so it doesn&#x27;t show up in pictures. I like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the formula for this once great oil absorbing powder changed--it not like the original.  Will be finding a replacement.</li>
    <li> This is such a simple product, but it is so good! I have no idea what it is that makes it what it is, but it helps me!! Again, too bad this item is discontinued!!</li>
    <li> This was the best face powder going in the 70s - and still is! Puh-leeze, Sally Hansen, put this back on the shelves!! Thankfully I was able to buy it through Amazon. Physician&#x27;s Formula, Revlon, Almay, NOTHING stops shine like this product!</li>
    <li> This was not the loose powder that I have ordered before. Have not tried it yet.Normally love this product. So should like it this way too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to be able find corn silk which is not sold in stores, but don&#x27;t like paying more than $10 for it.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised. exactly what I wanted. I hope this enough to last me because I wont be able to get it any longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame Sally Hansen, I love these products and I had to search the internet to find them because you stopped making them&lt;br /&gt;There  is something is business about loyalty to your customers like we are loyal to our brands.</li>
    <li> My favorite powder ever - the only makeup I&#x27;ve ever used - and now it&#x27;s discontinued!  :(</li>
    <li> So happy I can still get my Cornsilk pressed powder.  I have used Cornsilk for 25 years and want to continue indefinitely!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product does not seem the same as it used to be many, many years ago.  At that time it was the absolute best product to control oiliness and shine on the face!  And the no-color was a plus because it matched all skin colors.  I read on Amazon reviews that Sally Hansen was bought out by another company and they changed the original formula. This new product has a strong powdery-type fragrance I didn&#x27;t remember it having, and also has a chalky appearance when applied, but which does get better after having it on for awhile.  It does seem to help control oiliness on the skin.  However, I doubt I will purchase this again and instead will look for another product to help control oiliness and shine on my face.</li>
    <li> Very light, great for oily skin or to remove shine from nose, chin and forehead. Does not look like regular powder.</li>
    <li> Love this product. So glad to be able to find it. Can&#x27;t believe it no longer made. Thanks again for the sat ship and A++++ product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s annoying to me that this product, which used to be found in drug stores for a decent price is being sold online at an huge markup price just because it is discontinued. I love this and have ordered it on amazon before but as the price goes up, it&#x27;s not worth it. Wish they would bring it back.</li>
    <li> This powder takes the shine off without the nasty build up. Was so sorry when it was discontinued. Not sure why companies do that.</li>
    <li> Started using it as a teen for my then oily skin, still using it for my now combination skin. Hard to find, works beautifully, hope they bring it back.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Been using it for years and it never fails me.</li>
    <li> I never imagined I would ever again find a Cornsilk pressed powder compact!  This powder had always been my very favorite..</li>
    <li> Best powder ever made!!!  So sorry it has been discontinued!!</li>
    <li> For me the best way to get rid of shiny skin.  I have spent $$$$$ on matte products, but I still shine!  Corn Silk is an old product, but for me it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It goes back to the 70&#x27;s. Smells so good and really does the job. Translucent and takes way the shine.</li>
    <li> It really helps control shine, and it lasts all day. I also like the scent it has.</li>
    <li> I really wanted loose powder but ordered this in error.  It&#x27;s pressed powder but it works just fine.  I use a large brush with it and have no problem.  It might actually work better than loose powder because I only loosen what I need and waste very littlle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have the same fabulous results from this powder.  It didn&#x27;t seem like anything special and I found a mineral loose powder I prefer.</li>
    <li> I hope you never run out of this.......someone needs to make it again.........its great.....much better than mineral veil.</li>
    <li> I have used loose powder before, but like this much better. Seems to stay on longer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it is available for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff. I miss it in stores, but glad I can still find it here. Only two drawbacks: one &amp;#34;color&amp;#34;,very expensive.</li>
    <li> Great for oily complexions, and I love the smell of the powder.</li>
    <li> So happy I can still get my Cornsilk!</li>
    <li> I love this discontinued item. I was so happy to see that someone was selling it. It works great, without being cakey.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be colorless like the product I used before but it was not.  It has a very light shade to it.  It&#x27;s lighter than I really like.</li>
    <li> Horrified this product has been discontinued.  It&#x27;s an amazing pressed powder.</li>
    <li> Love it. Just love it!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting loose powder and this was pressed powder.  It does not meet my needs.</li>
    <li> This item is no longer on the market, and yet it is THE ONLY thing that works with my skin to eliminate shine and oil on my face. I break out easy (even though I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s), and I have super sensitive skin so it was hard for me to find a good product. I really hope I can continue to buy this product and I will definitely be returning for more in the future. I recommend this to all my friends. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I was excited when I saw this offered because I had read good reviews about it in the past but it was hard to find. I was thinking it might be my oily skin savior. For the record, I am a tough case when it comes to oily skin. Within 20 minutes of applying \\&quot;my face\\&quot; the oil is evident, and within 40 minutes it looks like I went bobbing for apples in a tub of grease. Gross. I&#x27;ve tried many many products to help with this- from urban decay to Peter thomas roth to smashbox to laura mercier to basic drugstore stuff and milk of magnesia...Powders, primers, mattifiers, washes, blotting sheets, and the like. Nothing helps. This was no different. It helps a tad to mattify when first applied but in less than 20 minutes we&#x27;re back to an oil-slick. I&#x27;ve been using Rimmel&#x27;s Stay Matte transparent powder for hourly (often more than that) touchups because it works the same as all these others but is cheaper. I just received Kryolan&#x27;s anti-shine powder and am hoping maybe it will be different. We&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> Am very happy with this product.  I find it very difficult to locate it now, due to the fact that it is not a product that you can find in Walgreen&#x27;s, CVS, Walmart or other stores.  The cost has jumped considerably now that you can only find it online.  The product is great, but difficult to find, and sometimes not cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MsKitty[[ASIN:B003V3YIJC Sally Hansen the Original Cornsilk Shineless Natural Matte Pressed Powder No Color 4502 (2 Pack)]]</li>
    <li> The shade is not right and even the consistency is much more powderey. I still have some left and it is not the same product as I was use too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years.  I prefer it for several reasons: it covers well without adding color, it absorbs oil and keeps my skin clear, it is light and not heavy or cakey, and the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that for the last several year it has become harder and harder to find.</li>
    <li> Love it  Used to use it way back when....glad to have it for a while longer! Finishes off a great makeup look!</li>
    <li> I really like this! I remember years ago using it. Glad I could find it again!</li>
    <li> Stays on your face all day.  Looks very natural!</li>
    <li> I always used this product by Coty.  It&#x27;s a very high quality and easy to use.  I was very disappointed when I could no longer find it in stores.  Almost as a lark, I checked Amazon to see if they had any and EUREKA!!  Very happy!!  LOL :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, could no longer find in stores, glad to find it here.  This wil not change your makeup color.  Can use alone for a matte finish.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend.  On my wedding day, I was looking pretty fierce after all the pictures/ceremony/dancing...and by &amp;#34;fierce,&amp;#34; I mean that I looked like the Bride of Frankenstein with a greasy mug.  Awesome... Then, my friend completely saved the day and produced this little miracle powder to me.  Completely gave my skin a matte, soft look.  No more sweaty grease!  Plus it&#x27;s clear, so it won&#x27;t give your skin a weird tint at all.  Love it, awesome product.</li>
    <li> This powder is wonderful.  NOTHING compares!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought something made by Cody because a reviewer&lt;br /&gt;said it was the same as Corn Silk and my face&lt;br /&gt;got dry patches all over it. I have even tried famous&lt;br /&gt;departmant store brands. So don&#x27;t let anyone&lt;br /&gt;tell you that their powder is the same as Corn Silk!&lt;br /&gt;I wish Sally Hensen would bring this powder back.</li>
    <li> I like this product for oil absorption.  It&#x27;s extremely hard to get other than on Amazon.  Hopefully, they&#x27;ll keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> Great product. Give a matte look, takes away oil shine. Been using this for years. Natural product, with or without foundation.</li>
    <li> Good quality and smells good too! I was happy to be able to find Cornsilk on Amazon. It is non existent in the stores.</li>
