      <li>Love these little guys!</li>
      <li>Even though they are a little more than Gillette&#x27;s 3- and 4-blade razor cartridges, they last noticeably longer.</li>
      <li>Soft too.</li>
      <li>These shave much closer than other blades.  </li>
      <li>I just like to protect my sensitive and dry skin without compromising the effectiveness of the blades.</li>

<li> By the way, I don&#x27;t really do this anymore because these blades last awhile, but if you&#x27;re on a tight budget and really need your blades to last, you can keep a small cup of mineral/baby oil in your shower and soak your razor in it in between shaves.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t use any other razor after using these...</li>
<li> As expected, could be slightly cheaper.</li>
<li> The cheaper series from this brand is a little rough.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s so hard to go back.</li>
<li> Last forever and hardly ever get a cut.</li>
<li> the next then you bear with it for the next 2 weeks because the refills are so expensive</li>
<li> Seriously, upgrade and you&#x27;ll thank yourself and each one of the 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> Expensive for razor blades</li>
<li> but I did finish my shower in a bad mood.</li>

    <li> The only way to go! I swear by Venus embrace. Gotta have the 5 blades. Great for legs, pits and bikini.</li>
    <li> I have always loved these. The cheaper series from this brand is a little rough. And I also don&#x27;t want to buy the most expensive. This is nice. Glides well. Close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Venus razors for years  - simply the best out there.</li>
    <li> The 5 blade embrace are the only razors I&#x27;ve ever used that don&#x27;t leave me with razor burn.</li>
    <li> My daughter insists on this brand -wont use anything else</li>
    <li> Nice to have a supply of blades waiting.</li>
    <li> Great price. What i needed</li>
    <li> i have been using these for years simply because they are the best razor out there. gives a very smooth shave without one nick. flawless shave!!</li>
    <li> Best razors I have ever used. Last forever and hardly ever get a cut. I can&#x27;t use any other razor after using these...guess I&#x27;m spoiled now!</li>
    <li> These are the only Venus razors I can use anymore; the others irritate my skin (including -and maybe even more than the others - the sensitive skin variety).</li>
    <li> awesome value - multiple purchases!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find a better razor that gives a closer shave without knicks or cuts. Love these little guys!</li>
    <li> These are my general go to blade perfect for my mini razor. Only issue is when it starts to get to gooey. I haven&#x27;t found away to battle that and I hang it just outside of the shower.</li>
    <li> Gillette its good for a week then okay the next then you bear with it for the next 2 weeks because the refills are so expensive</li>
    <li> Best razor on the market. Been using it for years. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great razor cartridges. My roommate and I both have slightly different Venus razors and these razor cartridges fit both of them perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built in moisture ribbon isn&#x27;t a substitute for shaving cream so you still need some type lubricant in my opinion, but it definitely contributes to a smoother shave. However, I think the key to these cartridges is the 5 blades. MY LEGS FEEL LIKE DOLPHINS AND MY ARM PITS HAVE NO INGROWN HAIRS!!! Sold. Once you start using 5 blades it&#x27;s so hard to go back. I used a Gillette 3-blade razor when I was traveling last week and I wanted to shoot myself. Okay not really but I did finish my shower in a bad mood. It took forever compared to these ones! Seriously, upgrade and you&#x27;ll thank yourself and each one of the 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this pack is a great price for how long these last. Even though they are a little more than Gillette&#x27;s 3- and 4-blade razor cartridges, they last noticeably longer. By the way, I don&#x27;t really do this anymore because these blades last awhile, but if you&#x27;re on a tight budget and really need your blades to last, you can keep a small cup of mineral/baby oil in your shower and soak your razor in it in between shaves. It keeps the blades sharp (mostly by staving off rust), but the only downside is it can start to dissolve the moisture strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, very happy with these! I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Tried the Gillette Venus in Passionista Purple and I&#x27;m sold. The shave was quick and smooth with no knicks. I was very pleased and would recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> great razors - fast shipping</li>
    <li> Expensive for razor blades</li>
    <li> I really like this new style-  works great, very smooth shave and no nics...I am a quick shaver and these are perfect!</li>
    <li> I really love these!!  I have used them for over a year and have yet to cut or nick myself.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but great razors.</li>
    <li> if you want to eliminate high cost at the supermarket or drug store, this is the suggestion, buy here. Save you the hassle of going to the store, paying an arm and leg for refills, amazon will just shipped to your door for free. Its not like you don&#x27;t know when you will be out of razors, they are apart of our lives forever, unless you have a gig part time as a gorilla impersonator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would suggest it for price and convienence.</li>
    <li> the skin feels very comfortable</li>
    <li> Does not irritate... it is my favorite razor and gives a close shave. I have it as a subscription... cannot live without it.</li>
    <li> These work better than any other razors I&#x27;ve tried. Soft too. They are pricey though, so if you don&#x27;t have stubborn body hair, go with something cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love Venus Embrace!  The 5 blades get my legs so smooth and it&#x27;s easy to maneuver around curvy places.  Well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a fast smooth shave. This product did not give me razorburn or nic my legs. I would definitely recommend Gillette Venus Embrace refills to anyone wishing for all of the above!</li>
    <li> Great!  These shave much closer than other blades.  I use additional shave cream and these work great with that.  They also work just fine without it, too.  I just like to protect my sensitive and dry skin without compromising the effectiveness of the blades.</li>
    <li> As expected, could be slightly cheaper. Or even an 8 pack.</li>
