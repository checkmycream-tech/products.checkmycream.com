      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>This peony shade is a nice dusty-rose neutral kind of color.</li>
      <li>My favorite Lip Gloss - my favorite color!  </li>
      <li>Love this, it is one of the more &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; types of lip shimmer you can buy and makes my lips feel great and look good without too much color.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the best color I&#x27;ve been able to find so far.  </li>
      <li>I tried this and love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and use all the time</li>
      <li>This is my favorite of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
      <li>I have been using Burts Bees lip shimmer for years and love the fact that it is not just a color but also moisturizes.  </li>
      <li>Better than chapstick, not glossy like lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>so you get that Blistex effect of softening and almost medicating chapped lips, but it comes in lovely shimmering colors</li>
      <li>I carry a stick of this in my pocket most of the time.  </li>
      <li>A nice light shimmery shade.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a long-time user of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer, and absolutely love the stuff.</li>
      <li>important if your lips are chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>4-pack makes this more economical, too.</li>
      <li>The color is a light an shimmery delight.</li>
      <li>product has a light mint flavor, and slides on smoothly with no &amp;#34;drag,&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Minty and fresh, glides on easily.  </li>
      <li>They come in different shades from just a hint of color, in a shade like Champagne, to a fair amount in shades like Merlot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve turned so many of my friends on to this product, because once they try it, they find that they like it as much as I do.</li>
      <li>Because there are a lot of oils in it, I find that I have to reapply it fairly often, but the color is sheer</li>
      <li>The peppermint oil is the thing that gives it the cool feeling that makes your lips feel so moisturized.</li>
      <li>Wish they&#x27;d come out with new shades, so I can try them, too!  : )</li>
      <li>The peony, however, is a particular favorite of mine.  </li>
      <li>Tingly and very pretty.</li>
      <li>Very unusual!</li>
      <li>Always keep one in your purse, car or pocket to quickly and easily make your face come alive.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right mixture of neutral mauve tones--perfect for any occasion, from going out to dinner, to walking the dog.  </li>
      <li>Pretty color.</li>
      <li>have probably 5 or 6 different shades, and this Peony is my favorite.</li>
      <li>The others I&#x27;ve tried are: Radiance (sheer shimmer), Champagne (subtle hint of pink), Caramel (similar to peony, but more of a rust than mauve), Toffee (great tan-brown, but can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore), Guava (pink; bit too frosty for me), Watermelon (one of my absolute faves--sort of a fuchsia, looks best dabbed on), &amp; Plum (bit on the dark side for me, but would be stunning on a darker complected person.  </li>
      <li>Very nourishing.  </li>
      <li>The seller was allso very prompt.</li>
      <li>It seems to be very cooling when you put it on.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a medium dusty rose color, very neutral and natural</li>
      <li>AND it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
      <li>Soft color, keeps your lips moist.</li>
      <li>I must have gone through a dozen of these lip shimmers over the past few years because they do such a good job of making my lips feel moist, even in the winter.</li>

    <li> I must have gone through a dozen of these lip shimmers over the past few years because they do such a good job of making my lips feel moist, even in the winter. The secret is a little bit of mint that gives chapped lips that cool feeling of being rescued from cold or windy weather in the winter or too much sun in the summer. They come in different shades from just a hint of color, in a shade like Champagne, to a fair amount in shades like Merlot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients they list are: helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, beeswax, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) wax, lanolin, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, tocopheryl acetate, tocopherol, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil. May contain: iron oxide, mica, carmine, titanium dioxide. The peppermint oil is the thing that gives it the cool feeling that makes your lips feel so moisturized. Because there are a lot of oils in it, I find that I have to reapply it fairly often, but the color is sheer so you don&#x27;t have a build up like you might with regular lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve turned so many of my friends on to this product, because once they try it, they find that they like it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I have been using Burts Bees lip shimmer for years and love the fact that it is not just a color but also moisturizes.  It seems to be very cooling when you put it on.  My husband likes the taste!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Better than chapstick, not glossy like lip gloss.  Very nourishing.  Pretty color.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find at the store, so I bought plenty on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this, it is one of the more &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; types of lip shimmer you can buy and makes my lips feel great and look good without too much color.</li>
    <li> Tingly and very pretty.</li>
    <li> I carry a stick of this in my pocket most of the time.  It does need to reapplied often.  A nice light shimmery shade.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s got a little peppermint or menthol or something in it so you get that Blistex effect of softening and almost medicating chapped lips, but it comes in lovely shimmering colors AND it&#x27;s all natural.  This peony shade is a nice dusty-rose neutral kind of color.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is wonderful lip balm.  The color is a light an shimmery delight. The seller was allso very prompt.</li>
    <li> Love this product and use all the time but this shipment arrived and two of the four were melted sideways in the tube.  Very unusual!</li>
    <li> The perfect go to for lip color!  Minty and fresh, glides on easily.  Always keep one in your purse, car or pocket to quickly and easily make your face come alive.</li>
    <li> My favorite Lip Gloss - my favorite color!  Great price for a 4 pack!</li>
    <li> I keep trying other lip glosses, but I always go back to Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I use it in place of lipstick/lip glass and chapstick.  Peony is a little too peachy but it&#x27;s the best color I&#x27;ve been able to find so far.  I&#x27;d prefer something a little pinker, but all their pink shades are either too light or too dark.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long-time user of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer, and absolutely love the stuff. The colors are sheer, with a hint of iridescence for a pearl-like effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have probably 5 or 6 different shades, and this Peony is my favorite. It&#x27;s a medium dusty rose color, very neutral and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a light mint flavor, and slides on smoothly with no &amp;#34;drag,&amp;#34; important if your lips are chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 4-pack makes this more economical, too.</li>
    <li> I loves Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I had been wearing the 8-hour lipcolors that had dried my lips out.  I tried this and love it.  Soft color, keeps your lips moist.</li>
    <li> Always have a spare of this great product. Now I have one in the house, car, and both purses and I am never without!</li>
    <li> Okay it&#x27;s common knowledge that I&#x27;m strangely addicted to Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer, in general.  The peony, however, is a particular favorite of mine.  It&#x27;s just the right mixture of neutral mauve tones--perfect for any occasion, from going out to dinner, to walking the dog.

Basically burgundy).  Wish they&#x27;d come out with new shades, so I can try them, too!  : )</li>
