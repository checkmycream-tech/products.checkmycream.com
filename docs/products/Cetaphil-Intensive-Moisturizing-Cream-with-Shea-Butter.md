<li> Normally cortisone helped surpress it but the past year my eczema was so bad that nothing was working.</li>
<li> The cap is very hard to open and this product is NOT paraben-free:(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If my wife likes it that means it is really good</li>
    <li> This is the same as the hand lotion they must have stopped making.  Always great for dry hands, when you need something thicker than a lotion.  Very gentle and powerful.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil  is the best moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Dr. recommended and I love this stuff.  Instantly cooling to the skin and very calming.</li>
    <li> Cream works well I think but I don&#x27;t know for sure since I switched to glycerin soap at the same time. My complaints have to do with packaging and ingredients. The cap is very hard to open and this product is NOT paraben-free:(</li>
    <li> This is Cetaphil&#x27;s best product yet, and I use several of their products.  Every morning before I leave the house and every night before bed, I apply this cream to my hands and feet--especially the cuticles.  My cuticles have never looked so good--and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for cuticles.  This isn&#x27;t advertised for cuticles, but it does the job for dry, broken-up cuticles.</li>
    <li> Not thick like a cream, more like a lotion but moisturizes like a cream. Absorbs well with no greasy residue. Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> This does an excellent job on my hands and feet.</li>
    <li> This cream helps restore my hands and cuticles after washing my hands and using alcohol rub all day after a long shift in the hospital. I highly recommend this product! I also use Gold Bond hand cream, it&#x27;s a little less expensive and works, however, after purchasing this product I find myself grabbing this tube more and more. I find its healing properties superior in my opinion. Non greasy, and highly effective!</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizing cream for hard working health care hands, nice small size of container useful for purse.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had an odd, red, bumpy area on both of my forearms.  I&#x27;ve heard it referred to as &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;?  Anyway, I used this after showering every day for a couple weeks and it cleared up.  When the same thing showed up on my face, I did the same with the same results.  Only drawback to it is the lid -- it&#x27;s hard to pry open.</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my hands and this really helps to keep my hands moisturized so that I won&#x27;t have as many flare ups.&lt;br /&gt;Hypoallergenic for skin conditions, with great moisturizing properties.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the money when you have a skin condition that it greatly helps with.</li>
    <li> Truly the best mositurizer I&#x27;ve bought...and that says a lot considering how many other brands I&#x27;ve tried. This line is designed by dermatologists and uses a small amount of oil to keep your skin hydrated and feeling great all day.</li>
    <li> This was suggested by my dermatologist when I had severe dermatitis on my hands. It is wonderful, not greasy, soothing and healing!</li>
    <li> nice and thick rich, i love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I have ever used. With my hands having issues from working with chemicals in the past, this cream moisturizes without being greasy. Not allergic to any ingredient in it.  I used to buy the Cetaphil Therapeutic Hand Cream that is no longer available,  It has the exact same ingredients list.</li>
    <li> Would not order again.  I read the ingredient list, and I see parabens in it.  Carconegenic, and no need for!</li>
    <li> Very effective..absorbs well..does not leave a greasy feeling on your skin...I will order more when this tube has been used.</li>
    <li> I was born with eczema. I have patches of it on my face. Normally cortisone helped surpress it but the past year my eczema was so bad that nothing was working. After using this cetaphil for over a month, my eczema is almost non-existent. My skin is much smoother. I recommend this product before going to the doctor.</li>
    <li> My husband hasn&#x27;t has a split finger since using this all day. He likes the larger tube which is a different formulation too.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite brands of hand cream.  It&#x27;s very rich, and it goes in quickly -- so you don&#x27;t have wait to use your hands.  For me, that means I moisturize more often.</li>
    <li> Not as good as their Therapeutic hand cream. It&#x27;s nice, but jus not as good.</li>
    <li> softened dry cracked heels..no need for pedicure..very impressed..hands are very soft also..just ordered 7 more..love this lotion!</li>
    <li> I had such dry, cracked, peeling skin on my hands that I had to find something.  I decided to try this intensive moisturizing cream and absolutely loved it.  Bought more for myself and got a few tubes for by daughter-in-law who has very dry hands.  This cream is absorbed instantly and is not greasy at all, which is something I hate about many of the intensive creams.  It truly worked to heal and keep my hands moisturized and I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Love this Cetaphil cream in this portable travel size.</li>
