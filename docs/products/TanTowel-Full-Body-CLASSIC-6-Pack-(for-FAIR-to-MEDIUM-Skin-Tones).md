    <li> Best self tanning product I could find. Easy to apply. Nice look. Would of given it a 5 star, but it has a slight odor.</li>
    <li> A nice natural color, but unfortunately I&#x27;m allergic. Makes my legs itch like CRAZY the next day. If you&#x27;re not sensitive, I recommend.</li>
    <li> These towels (full body) are very cool! I use 1-2 a week and they give a very nice color, not orangey at all! I think if you would use more than 2 a week.&lt;br /&gt;The half-body tantowels are nice too, but are about half the size of the full body towel. I used to use the tanning bed one-two times a week, but now i don&#x27;t use the tanning bed at all! Tanning towels are much safer and gives a nice look!!! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Best self tanning product ever.</li>
    <li> i did purchase this item in the summer time and i loved it.  I do recommend this to every one who wants to get their tan on .. i want it year round not too dark but just a natural glowing look.  I get lots of compliments and i feel great at being 53 and my tan going on fabulisima.  Buy it !</li>

    <li> I adore these tan towels.  They leave a very natural tan that fades away without looking speckled.  I recommend these!</li>
    <li> I love this self tanner. It dries very quickly and never transfers to clothing or bedding. The smell isn&#x27;t off putting like other self tanners. It does take up to 24 hours to completely develop. The tan lasts several days on my dry skin. I have already ordered another pack. A very real looking color with no mess or fuss.</li>
    <li> I love these tanning towels!!!  They give a very even, natural looking tan.  The smell is not bad either.  I apply it at night and then wash the next morning, so I will not have that \\&quot;tanning lotion smell\\&quot; through out the day.  It does not rub off easily and it fades evenly too.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Didn&#x27;t make me orange. It took me a few tries to learn how to apply it without making any funny streaks on my body.</li>
    <li> Not good for my skin tone - too orange-y.</li>
    <li> I Used  these tanning towels during vacation. So easy to use and they gave me a  nice , even tan in a matter of hours!!!  My tan stayed on even when I went swimming. Will continue to use this product from now on.</li>
