      <li>So many people swear by this</li>

      <li>I use it some mornings and mostly at night.</li>
      <li>My favorite is Paula&#x27;s Choice clinical 1% retinol treatment, which I always mix with a hydrating serum before applying to my skin.</li>
      <li>Really love this product with their reasonal price and quality.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s been lots of hypes in the korean skincare market about fermented essence and this one and SK-II were one of the top brands for it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really like the product so far, it has done wonders my my oiliness, especially when I wake up in the morning. I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s done anything for my pores, or wrinkles (because I don&#x27;t have many to begin with), but I like the product. The shipping was also prompt and on time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I literally don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s in this, but it&#x27;s the first thing that&#x27;s made my acne-prone, hyperpigmented skin look glowy and radiant. I use it once a day at night, smooth it on with a cotton ball, and in one week I noticed a difference. In three, my skin looks healthy enough to where I would risk going outside without makeup. That&#x27;s NEVER happened. I know it has to be just this product since it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;m using other than a retin-a cream for my acne, but I&#x27;ve been using the cream for years. Whatever this stuff is, it&#x27;s amazing. Don&#x27;t even think about it, just buy it.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life? In just a few days, I already noted improvement in my complexion. Even my friend gave a compliment. Love this product. I have acne prone sensitive skin so I have always been concerned how products would react. This was almost like a miracle. My pores look smaller, brighter, and skin below my eyes smoother. Thanks Missha!!!</li>
    <li> Have wanted to try SK II forever, but just couldn&#x27;t justify the cost to myself...this wonderful stuff is already making itself indispensable to my skincare routine...it goes on easily, absorbs quickly, and my skin looks better than ever!!  Couldn&#x27;t be more delighted with it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is liquid gold. I have acne, and oily/dehydrated skin. I use tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide (on alternating nights) to keep the zits in check, but my skin is always red and flakey, no matter how much moisturizer i pile on. and by the end of the day, my skin is both greasy and flakey, a winning combination. I started using this a week ago, and I&#x27;m totally hooked. The breakout I was fighting totally calmed down and cleared up, a lot quicker than usual too. My skin is so so soft, I have to stop myself from constantly petting it. The texture is smoother and more evened out, it makes my pores way less noticeable, and my skin is glowing. My skin has stopped flaking, irritation is way down, and it&#x27;s not red anymore. I love this stuff. doesn&#x27;t make me oily either. Price is steep, but it&#x27;s a huge bottle and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work after reading all of the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, I had to return it due to the fact that it made my face break out completely. I have sensitive skin so it didn&#x27;t come as a great surprise, but there are several other Korean products that I use that are not specifically made for sensitive skin that I can use without consequence. Not only did I get acne all over my face but I also had reddening/hardening that felt like a burn. It took 2-3 weeks for my skin to return to normal after discontinuing the use of this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product in combination with other Missha products.</li>
    <li> EDIT: After using it for awhile, it has started to break me out! It does give me that glow of healthy skin, but not worth it when your cheek is covered in closed comodones! Make sure you patch test! I had to go back and take off two stars :/  This product has cult status in Asian skincare circles, but I could not believe how well it works until I saw it first hand. The First Treatment Essence has calmed my acne, brightened and reduced my post inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and has generally evened out my skin texture far better than it has ever looked since I hit puberty. Instant HG status for me.</li>
    <li> Exactly as the title of my review reads! I saw results the first day my package arrived. I have combination oily skin and acne has been something I&#x27;ve battled since I was 12. In recent years, it&#x27;s been more sporadic and only prone to showing up the week after my period. I ordered this, despite having no wrinkles yet because I wanted to prepare myself. Not only does it make my skin glow, but it removes sebaceous filaments on the end of my nose, causes my pores to vanish, firms my skin, and helps with redness caused by acne. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any signs of a breakout since I began using this. There is no foul odor and it does not irritate. Continuing to purchase, as always, with all of my beloved Korean skin care miracles.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. It never lets me disappointed. Love it.</li>
    <li> Buying again !!! it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to use an essence in their skin care, but doesn&#x27;t have the money to purchase the SKII essence.  In my opinion, after using both products, I find this one to be the superior product, not just because of the price.</li>
    <li> Korean skincare all the way! This is a game changer, my skin feels brighter, like glowing from within, fine lines have disappeared and pores have reduced tremendously. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne scars that won&#x27;t go away for the past year. After trying this, it&#x27;s the thing that made them fade! I&#x27;ve tried natural products, clinique dark spot corrector, exfoliation, and a few other things, but this essence wins hands down. It has also taken away my fine lines and gives my skin a nice glow after a week of using it.    Like other reviewers, I shake out a few drops into my hands and apply. I followed the box instructions to use after washing my face, and before using a serum or moisturizer. I will keep on buying this as long as it works. I&#x27;m hoping I can look like this forever.</li>
    <li> Very detailed review for the skin-care obsessed (like me):&lt;br /&gt;My skin type: breakout-prone, sensitized, extremely dehydrated but oily at the same time (because my skin is so dehydrated, it overproduces oil to compensate, giving me almost constant clogged pores). I ruined my skin when I was younger by using Accutane, something I knew nothing about but my parents suggested I try after trying all the acne treatments out there...ever since, my skin has been chronically dehydrated and sensitized, overproducing oil and clogging my pores. Rough skin texture, dull, hyper-pigmentation from acne marks, dehydrated but surface oily skin--I have it alI, including dehydration lines that mimic aging lines, under my eyes and on my cheeks...the kind that seem to crinkle when I move my facial muscles (this makes my mid 20&#x27;s skin look much older than it should). My skin was always very rough to the touch, with completely clogged pores from lazy exfoliation. As I&#x27;ve gotten older and have made taking care of my skin a priority, I have researched approaches and products that can heal, hydrate, balance, even out, and resurface my skin, clearing my clogged pores and preventing breakouts. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything, at all price points. FINALLY, I think I have found the routine that has given me the most amazing skin I have ever had in my life!(I detail it below if you&#x27;re interested in the full routine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first &#x27;essence&#x27; I have ever used--because it is liquid, I use it as a &#x27;toner&#x27; step in my skincare routine. I love this product--it is a fragrance-free, colorless liquid that I pour into my hands, rub together, and apply all over my face, neck and chest using light patting motions, applying extra to my under-eye area and my cheeks where I am especially dry. After this product dries on my skin (about 45 seconds), I swear my pores look cleaner and more refined. My skin looks and feels more hydrated, and the dehydration lines under my eyes and on my cheeks are slightly plumped out! That is all what I can see instantly after using this product. As I&#x27;ve used this over time (I am almost finished with my first bottle and am ordering my second one), I feel this product has contributed to the best skin of my life, hands down. My pores are staying consistently &#x27;smaller&#x27; looking (they&#x27;re not actually smaller as no product can &#x27;shrink&#x27; pore size, but they can be refined, and I promise this essence has made my pores NOTICEABLY more refined and smaller looking). This product is very hydrating, never drying. It helps to instantly plump my dry lines, and over time my skin has been feeling more moisturized, and has begun to lessen its production of oil. I expect this to continue to improve the longer I use. This is seriously one of the best products I have ever used. Even though it is technically an essence and could be applied after a toner, I prefer to use this instead of a toner, after I cleanse my skin and before applying my daily exfoliant. I have used this product in my skincare routine twice a day, every day for the past several weeks--this product hydrates, calms, and refines my skin beautifully, and has never broken me out or irritated my skin. I also believe it has gradually started to assist in lightening my hyper-pigmentation spots on my jawline from past acne marks, combined with my daily exfoliant and nightly retinol treatment, and daily sunscreen use. After years of trial and error and lazy skincare, I have completely transformed my skin in the past several months, and finally feel like I am using properly targeted treatments for my skin issues, which focus on healing, resurfacing to get rid of clogged pores, hydrating to control oil production, fading hyper-pigmentation, and preventing breakouts. As of today, about a year after rigorously researching, trying new products, different approaches, very expensive skincare lines, etc, I am very happy with my skin progress and am starting to see skin that I&#x27;ve never seen in my life--soft texture, clear, smaller, pores, plumped out, fading hyper-pigmentation, fewer breakouts, and less oil overproduction. Missha&#x27;s First Treatment Essence has only enhanced other products, and on its own makes enough of a difference in my skin to make it a holy grail product for me. If I am traveling and miss a day of this product, I can tell a difference in my skin--it just doesn&#x27;t &#x27;glow&#x27; as much, and doesn&#x27;t hold moisture as well. If you&#x27;re interested in the full routine that is working for me currently, here it is:&lt;br /&gt;Morning:&lt;br /&gt;1- cleanse thoroughly, but very, very gently! Never use scrubs, or anything with a &#x27;texture&#x27; to it--ever! These will cause micro-tears on your skin and irritation, making it prone to over-produce oil. I can&#x27;t use foaming cleansers either for my skin type, they are too drying and cause my oily skin to become even more oily. I use a simple, gentle, hydrating cream cleanser, and ALWAYS double cleanse (at least at night). Cleanse once to remove makeup and oils, and cleanse again to actually cleanse the skin. Pat dry. After cleansing, skin should not be red (sensitized), and should not feel dehydrated. Skin should feel moisturized, or your cleanser is too irritating.&lt;br /&gt;2- Missha&#x27;s First Treatment Essence. Pat all over face, neck and chest. I apply generously under my eyes and upper cheek area where I am very dehydrated. I allow it to dry 30ish seconds.&lt;br /&gt;3- Exfoliant. I use Paula&#x27;s Choice liquid BHA exfoliant, which has completely changed my skin. My pores are cleaner, my texture is the smoothest it has ever been, and my blackheads around my nose are slowly disappearing. I apply this liquid with my fingers all over my face and chest, and, along with Missha&#x27;s Essence, it has started to lighten my hyper-pigmentation and just makes my skin glow (seriously). I think it is the perfect product to use with Missha&#x27;s essence, as they complement each other so amazingly on my skin, and it is glowing like it has never glowed in my life.&lt;br/&gt;4- Serum and acne treatment. I use a hydrating antioxidant serum (also by Paula&#x27;s Choice, the ultra-light concentrate serum) all over my face and eyes. On my jawline and chin, I apply an acne treatment (I use Paula&#x27;s Choice regular strength one).&lt;br /&gt;5- Eye cream+Moisturizer+Sunscreen- I use an eye cream, a light moisturizer (Paula&#x27;s choice hydralight), plus Elta MD&#x27;s UV-clear sunscreen, for acne-prone, hyper-pigmented skin that is also prone to redness. NEVER leave the house without sunscreen, your dark spots will never go away. I even wear sunscreen inside when I don&#x27;t plan to go out (because of the UV exposure risk through windows).&lt;br /&gt;Night:&lt;br /&gt;1- cleanse (always double-cleanse at night! I use an oil cleanser (DHC) first, to remove make-up, then my usual hydrating cream cleanser to cleanse a second time.&lt;br /&gt;2- Missha&#x27;s First Treatment Essence. Same as morning.&lt;br /&gt;3- Exfoliant/Retinol. Every other night, I use the same liquid BHA exfoliant as my morning routine. On the other nights, I use a retinol treatment. My favorite is Paula&#x27;s Choice clinical 1% retinol treatment, which I always mix with a hydrating serum before applying to my skin. I worked up to this amount of retinol gradually, starting with once a week. My skin has never looked clearer, and has never felt so soft.&lt;br /&gt;4- Acne treatment+Eye cream+Moisturizer. I spot treat with acne cream where I need it, and apply a thicker moisturizer than I use during the day (Paula&#x27;s Choice moisture boost) all over my face, neck, chest, and hands. Eye cream is an essential, I use a regular eye cream and then apply a few drops of argan oil on top of that at night for extra moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: I have very difficult skin. I damaged it with Accutane when I was a teenager, and ever since have had breakouts, clogged pores, rough and bumpy texture from improper exfoliation, and chronically dehydrated yet surface oily skin. I have tried every product out there, and in the past year, have begun finding a routine that has actually worked and my skin is looking so much improved!! Adding Missha&#x27;s Essence to my skincare routine has completely changed my skin and my results--I use it after cleansing, and instantly my pores look refined, smaller, cleaner, my skin seems to &#x27;glow,&#x27; and dry lines are more plumped out. Over time, after using almost 1 full bottle of this, I guarantee my skin is improved. I believe this product has increased my skin&#x27;s moisture, has helped my pores stay refined and smaller looking, and has gradually helped fade some hyper-pigmentation marks, making my skin look more even-toned and radiant. Very highly recommend. A holy grail product for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a first essence I tried.  After continually using it, I could feel that my skin is softer and brighter.  The essence itself is quite thick so it takes some time to be absorbed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any noticeable improvement and this product irritates my hypersensitive skin.  I am disappointed with this product and will not repurchase.  I gave away my bottle to someone with less sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Super love it great face care product and service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks. I apply it everyday before bed and it has improved my skin greatly. My pores has shrunk in size and it has even out my skin tone very well. It also gives your face this glow. I highly recommend this product for those with any skin type.</li>
    <li> It feels nice going on, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This product became known to me as &amp;#34;the emperors serum&amp;#34; because it has no smell, no feel/sensation, and absolutely no effect on my skin.  In fact, I had finally gotten my skin to clear up quite a bit with a new soap, before I started to use this and it seemed to make things worse again.  A huge waste of money. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very pleased with the difference it has made in my skin along with the Moistfull Collagen and Missha serum.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! I cannot use moisturizers on my face because they ALL make me break out. However, essence is a liquid moisturizer. I just dab it on my face with a cotton ball at night and the next morning my face has a healthy glow. The only knock is this took awhile for me to receive but it did come from Korea so whatever. It was well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> i didnt see a difference. and i cant even read the ingredients. too expensive for what it doesnt do. ill stick to my rosewater instead</li>
    <li> I love this! I pat this into my skin after I use my hada labo hyaluronic acid lotion(toner) and before my moisturizer. I have really, i mean really, oily skin and this is not oily for me at all. I use it morning and night and it has kept my skin soft and supple. I also used to have bad acne for years. My skin is clear now, but I&#x27;m left with alot of hyperpigmentation. I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to tell whether the essence has helped lighten my hyperpigmentation or not, but I will update my review in a couple months if I see any major results. The product was also expected to be delivered in january, but I received this in just 2 weeks after I had ordered it. Overall, I highly recommend this essence</li>
    <li> WOW!!!! This product is amazing! I have troubled acne prone skin and in two uses this product has calmed my red spots, and helped to reduce the number of blackheads on my face. It also has started to fade some of my acne scars!</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product, I did get a slight rash. I decided to stick it out and the irritation was less and less each day I used it. I don&#x27;t have any problems with it anymore. My skin has cleared up after using this and I have even noticed that my acne scars (which I&#x27;ve had for 1-2 years) have started to lighten and clear up. Love this product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this. I use it right after washing my face, it goes on like water, sinks in immediately and then... I don&#x27;t know what it does, but it&#x27;s magical. It has taken the redness from my nose, faded some freckles and overall improved my skin tone. I use it with Benton products, but this as my first step has made a ton of difference to my skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin soft, love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with the results from the  first bottle I used, I ordered another one. I don&#x27;t know whether their formula changed, or I just hit a plateau, but this didn&#x27;t have any impact on my skin. It feels good and is not irritating, but I just didn&#x27;t see enough of a difference in my skin tone or texture this time around. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great Service! Quality product.</li>
    <li> Great product, I can actually see the difference on my skin texture and more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I am planning on buying it again when i run out.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works but I love it and I don&#x27;t know why! Doesn&#x27;t smell like anything but my skin looks better already!</li>
    <li> I love this product! The consistency is very watery like a toner, it is quickly absorbed and you can immediately feel the firming results. I have not tried the SKII essence, and I would love to see a review of the comparison. I think this product would perform as well if not better at 1/3 of the price, this will definitely be a repurchase. Anyone with aging skin, looking for a toner should buy this one first.</li>
    <li> I really liked the results of this product.  It left my skin feeling refreshed and clean.  No dryness or tightening.  Left my skin smooth and soft.  I did notice an appearance of smaller pores af a short time of use.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff now, It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Up until now I&#x27;d been using From Nature&#x27;s Age The Treatment Essence and I absolutely loved it (and the price: $8 for the same amount!) However RoseRoseShop is no longer carrying it so after doing some research I found that this is a good and more popular dupe for SK-II Treatment Essence. This works just as well as From Nature&#x27;s but the price hike did put me off a bit. Still, it&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> made my skin breakout whenever I attempted to use it.</li>
    <li> Lightens skin tone. Works better than SKII (for me).</li>
    <li> I have noticed a positive change in my skin moisture since I purchased both this product and Missha brightening moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, but I have been trying to take better care of my skin as I am approaching 30, so I decided to try it.  RIght away after the first use, I noticed a more even skin tone and decreased redness.  I have been using it for a full month, twice a day, and I notice much more even skin.  It only takes a little bit (3-4 drops) to apply to my  entire face, so this bottle is going to last me a while.  I am definitely glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> I received the intensive version, which does not include their licorice extract. Under important ingredients, this item was listed as including the licorice extract, and even the image shows the original product with the licorice extract. The version I received has &amp;#34;INTENSIVE&amp;#34; written on the bottle, and does not include licorice extract. This is clearly a misrepresentation of product, and false advertising. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for one week and noticed huge different in my skin tone. I usually have dry skin but after one week of usage my skin is much softer and clearer. So far it does not lighten my dark spots but it seems to lessen the redness on my face. Definitely will look into buying some more products from this line.</li>
    <li> This product is definitly not for acne prone skin. I would not recommend using this product unless your skin is between the normal to normal combination dry (and possibly mature) type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed on the first day of use that my cheeks around my nose erruped into little bumps of acne that never quite came to the surface of the skin. Discontinuing the product stopped the unusual breakouts and since discontinuing, the breakouts have healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say much about any of the other claims; I was never able to use this long enough to attest to them.</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle 2x a day for 4-5 months and noticed nearly no difference what so ever , my skin just got a bit brighter</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It helped rehydrate my very dehydrated skin and give me back my glow.</li>
    <li> legit. skin seems to get clearer and look healthier. great and cheaper alternative to the SK-II</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive to try this because of the price, but let me tell you this is worth every penny. Made with fermented yeast, known for its skin healing properties, this product is heaven sent. I use this after cleansing and toning and it feels great on my skin. My skin is acne prone and oily and this brightens it instantly. You need very little and the top only allows for a small drip so skip the cotton pad, it wastes product. Wash your hands and apply with your fingertips to get the most for your money.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t suit my sensitive skin.  My rosacea flared up during the week I used the essence.  It felt more like a regular toner than what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. It was the missing piece in my skincare routine. Within a week my skin tone was more even and had fewer breakouts, great for that young 30 something skin. I would say I had very combination skin, and now I can say my skin looks healthy and appropriate for my age. After reading about it on the korean beauty blogs I figured I will try it, and now I don&#x27;t know how I will live without it. Left it home on a week vacation... Never again. My skin got all dry again and went on the fritz. Like 5 days later and using it again my skin is calm and clear.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so soft after a few weeks using this. I&#x27;d recommend putting a few drops on your hands and gently patting it into your clean face. The bottle is lovely -- frosted glass silver cap. It doesn&#x27;t flow out of the bottle that easily (you need to shake it a bit) but otherwise I would probably use too much. The smell is a little unusual (from the yeast maybe?) but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a bout a month now and it is a really great treatment.  I use it after cleansing, before putting on any oils or serums.  It works best when you apply to damp skin and let is really set in.  I usually let it sit for a few minutes before applying anything else.</li>
    <li> Really love this product with their reasonal price and quality.</li>
    <li> love the product, fast shipment, thanks!</li>
    <li> (Detailed Review) I just started the Korean beauty regimen 2 months ago, minus the essence because I thought the double cleanse-toner-serum-eye cream-moisturizer-mask routine was enough. This 7-step ritual WAS enough (I list them below).  My fine lines faded, discoloration evened out, texture became baby smooth &amp; pores got refined. I converted from Western brands to the Korean products thereby saving me a lot of money while FINALLY seeing &amp; feeling dramatic results.  I started using the Missha Time Revolution Essence 3 weeks ago. It&#x27;s awesome! ...my husband of almost a decade who didn&#x27;t comment when I chopped off a foot of hair, lost 50lbs of post pregnancy weight in no time, (you get the idea...a winged unicorn could land on the front lawn &amp; you wouldn&#x27;t get a peep out of him) said, &amp;#34;What make up are you using? You&#x27;re skin is GLOWING.&amp;#34;  ...I did NOT have make up on!  Oh, my gosh! My husband just said that????  So That is a testimony to this Essence. When I don&#x27;t use it, I really can tell the difference. Right after cleansing, I use it as the first layer and immediately, my skin comes alive. It becomes plumped out, even smoother, even softer &amp; does actually glow.  The products I use are almost all Mizon. (I started out having dry/combination skin while going through Sephora/ Clinique/ Chanel/ kiehl&#x27;s/ Mario Badescu products through the years. Not anymore.)  1- Smashbox make up remover (when this runs out, I will try The Face Shop cleansing oil)  2- Cetaphil facial cleanser (when this runs out, I&#x27;ll try one of Mizon&#x27;s facial cleansers)  3-Clinique toner  4- Missha Time Revolution Essence  5- Mizon Hyalauronic Acid Serum (light blue bottle)  6- Mizon Snail Repair Eye Cream  7-  Mizon All In One Snail Repair Cream  8-  Mizon Goodnight Anti-Wrinkle Mask (before sleeping, at least 3x/week)  Or in the morning...  8- Clinique Moisturesurge CC Cream or Smashbox BB Cream (I am on the hunt for a Korean BB Cream.  I tried TonyMoly Glow Aura but it was too white thoughmore hydrating than Clinique Moisturesurge &amp; Smashbox)  I&#x27;m so glad I started using this Missha Time Revolution Essence! Btw, thank you for the samples that came with it!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m trying this product/brand and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised how well its taken care of my skin. It has a watery consistency and a slightly yeasty smell but nothing unpleasant. It goes on after cleansing, I gently pat it onto my face until it absorbs and then put on rentin-a + moisurizer. It doesent feel sticky and after about a week of use I noticed the irritation/redness from retin a has gotten considerably better. After looking at the ingredients list this product has some great antiflamitory properties on top of the main fermented ingredient. Overall I m very happy with this product my skin looks even and plump. I m looking forward to trying more productive from missha.</li>
    <li> After reading glowing reviews of the Missha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence in a few places (here, SokoGlam, SkinandTonics), I decided to buy it. Unfortunately, I’m extremely allergic to it. I put it on at night after washing my face and then applying the Biologique Recherche serum and moisturizer. The Missha Essence was the only new thing I added to my routine, which has been the same since October. Anyway, I noticed my eyes were a bit itchy when I went to bed, but it was when I woke up that I had hives all over my eyes, as well as small zits and blackheads all over my face. It was awful! I just wanted to post this somewhere to warn others who *may* be very sensitive to products, since I haven’t really seen anything online about other allergic reactions. Too bad, because I really was hoping to integrate this into my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best thing I used ever! I have a lot of pimples, cystic acne, pimples scar and such. And I&#x27;ve suffered for years since high school. What really helps me finally is changing pillow case often, facing straight when sleeping, stop touching my face and putting my teddy bear on my face, exfoliating using cheap generic japanese rubber facial brush, Cure exfoliating gel and this!! My skin is renew at a fast rate and my scar is disappearing. This product contains so many nutrients for your skin that it makes my skin so smooth like a baby&#x27;s bum. It prepares my skin for the freshener and skin lotion and other creme I used and everything just takes on fabulously. I don&#x27;t want to wear foundation ever again!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really works wonder on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I drink coffee like 3-4 large size daily and sleep only 5-6 hours most of my days.&lt;br /&gt;My friends keep saying that I don&#x27;t look like I didn&#x27;t get much sleep and even said that my face looks bright and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing research on this product for sometime versus SK2. And found out that the reviews often said that this works as well (sometime better) than SK2 for a lot cheaper price. So I tried this, and finished my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I really need to get more!&lt;br /&gt;And this time I want to try with the Time Revolution Night Repair!&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see greater result!</li>
    <li> Awesome toner, helps my dry skin immensely, only need a small amount, I use it morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing as well as it is very subtle, makes my skin feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> After reading and watching some rave reviews for this product, I was excited to try it out. However, after a couple of tries and retries with my recent purchase from a week ago, I was unfortunately mistaken with this purchase. Firstly, I received the &amp;#34;Intensive&amp;#34; one, which I hadn&#x27;t even ordered in the first place. Rather than helping my skin, this made me break out, and it felt rough and drying once I put it on. The smell is a little off-putting because of the yeast, which is to be expected. However, I was disappointed that this did not work out for me and I spent $28 on it. Definitely wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but it didn&#x27;t wow me like Su:m37&#x27;s Secret Programming Essence. That stuff made a huge difference on my skin.</li>
    <li> I gave this a few chances over the last three months, and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin to products, but I notice that after I&#x27;ve used this product specifically a zit or ten will pop up. It seems like a genuine product with legit packaging and I&#x27;m not sure of the manufacture date so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a fault in the product or it&#x27;s just not compatible with my skin. So many people swear by this so I was pretty disappointed. I guess you win some and you lose some.</li>
    <li> I have fair, freckled, sensitive, combination skin, as you can imagine it is hard for me to find a moisturizer that will not cause breakouts or aggravate my skin. I was going through a particular bad skin phase when I bought this; my skin was having both dry and oily patches with red under the skin acne around my foreheard. I had purchased all sorts of products, high end to natural, nothing was really working. After using this product for about a week, I started noticing that my skin was balanced and I was not getting any more breakouts. Fast-forward to a month later I have 0 redness, 0 breakouts, and glowing skin. I do not need to wear makeup, other than under my eyes, since I have dark circles (genetics, mom, grandmas), my skin is glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this product, the only other thing I am using on my face is Walgreens generic version of Hibiclens, which a pre-surgery wash not designed for the face, but again, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and is meant to kill bacteria without causing resistance. I started using both products at the same time, so I cannot comment whether the effects I am seeing are from the combination of the two or just one. If you want to try Walgreens generic version of Hibiclens as a face wash, just be careful to not get it in your eyes as it stings a lot, wash it off with a lot of water to ensure that your face is 100 free of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product 2x a day, morning and night, face and neck, have gone through about 1/2 a bottle. I just pour it in my palm and spread it by patting it on, since there is less wasted product this way than if I were to use a cotton sheet, also because I have sensitive skin rubbing on cotton is not a good idea.</li>
    <li> This toner is just wonderfully refreshing. It does not sting or burn but I am noticing an improvement in the texture of my skin. I use it twice a day right after cleansing my face. My skin is usually very dry and sensitive but since I started using this product in tandem with the Rohto Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion Moist, My skin has been soft &amp; smooth with the fine lines disappearing. I do not require near as much moisturizer, at least 3/4 amt. less than previously. Be sure to use consistently and also use on your neck and decoulette&#x27; as they too are generally fragile skin that tend to dry and age quickly.</li>
    <li> Why din&#x27;t i buy this product sooner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so sure with the new formula. I used to like it a lot, now it&#x27;s ok. Since I&#x27;m switching to more natural/organic product, I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have really noticeable black dots in my nose that I&#x27;ve always thought to have been blackheads until I learned they were actually sebaceous filaments and that they&#x27;re going to always be there.  In the process of learning of how to live with them, this product has really helped me out so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sebaceous filaments are now transparent and don&#x27;t even seem like they&#x27;re there anymore, thanks to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I cleanse, then I use this product, and then I moisturize.  That&#x27;s my skincare routine and my looks amazing :)</li>
    <li> This is more like a toner. It takes off leftover dirt/makeup and leaves skin soft. Probably will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love Missha products...especially the essence. I use this after the toner and it helps removes excess dirt and oil that cleansing cannot catch. I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 6 months (I switched to the Korean beauty routine 6 months ago) and have noticed my skin is brighter and less blemishes. I highly recommend this essence!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a big change in my skin after using this! There is a slight yeast smell, if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents. Came in a timely manner and was very carefully  packed.</li>
    <li> An amazing product, I&#x27;ve notice my skin has less pigmentation, rough scars on my forehead from acne have also slowly disappeared. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but when I buy this in the States, it is cheaper than in Korea. It comes fast and has good quality and reasonable price. Good.</li>
    <li> I was using Secret Key&#x27;s First Time Treatment- and it made my skin sticky and oily and was just not good. So I sucked it up and dropped a pretty penny on Missha&#x27;s. I am not only super pleased, but I am willing to say that it was worth the extra money. It&#x27;s a fantastic value in comparison to SK-II. After just three days of use, my skin is already recovering quickly from the Secret Key. My skin feels hydrated and my breakouts are starting to vanish! This is worth a shot if you haven&#x27;t had any luck with cheaper brands! Also, my skin type is sensitive combination. I tend to be dry on my cheeks and between my brows and oily on the rest of my T-zone. This has helped everything be smooth and soft! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This particular essence was highly recommended in many skincare blogs that I read. I was very excited to receive it, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. Love the freshness and no irritation!! :)</li>
    <li> This thing gives me red bumps/zits. The first time I got it, i thought it was other products I was using but the minute I stopped using this it went away. I then tried it again 4 times off an on after and it gave me the same result. I guess it is not for everyone, which is disappointing. I have normal skin and don&#x27;t get breakouts.</li>
    <li> Another purchase after reading countless reviews of its similarity to the SK-II essence. Definitely gives similar/same results at way less, and I love how gentle it is. Definitely takes a few weeks of use to see results but I&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love.  This has decreased the appearance of my chicken pox scars from when I was young. Provided clarity to my skin and generally improved the appearance.  I do have to switch off this toner every 2 months or so to maintain its efficacy but other than that, this product is a favorite essence.  I did not use essences prior to this, but now I&#x27;m a believer.  Note that it is MUCH cheaper to purchase this directly from the Missha website when there is a sale as opposed to from 3rd party sellers on Amazon. If Amazon sold this directly I&#x27;d probably buy it through Prime.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I paid $50 for this item and I thought that was a pretty good deal compared with the Estee Lauder version at around $100 and Sk-II version at $165 for 5 ounces. I did my homework and came across this product. This product has a high percentage of the key ingredient and works very well. I have very sensitive skin and I have never broken out. I put the product in the palm of my hand and apply to my face. I use it 2-3 times  a week. I definitely would purchase again. If your interested in this type of product its a best buy</li>
    <li> This was one of the most recommended products on Youtube videos that tackled Korean skincare routines.  Apparently, this is a cheaper alternative to a ridiculously expensive product that is similar.  I&#x27;ve never tried that product, but I have religiously used this twice a day since I received it from Amazon.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what it does, but I apply it to my skin immediately after patting it dry and it is almost like a treat for my skin!</li>
    <li> This is the best skincare product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I went to Sephora recently and the saleswoman asked me for skincare recommendations.  No lie.  This product gives great glow, smoothness, and brightness, and makes pores look smaller.</li>
    <li> I bought mine from BB Cosmetic (and two other products also), great service from them and the products so far are very authentic. So, if you buy your Korean skin care/cosmetics on Amazon, try to stick with BB Cosmetic. (I do not work or am associated with the company. But it would help if Amazon had some sort of company rating like Ebay.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Essence. LOVE IT. I&#x27;m a HUGE SK-II fan. Love LOVE LOVE their Essence. Used it for years when I lived overseas, but when I returned to the States I could no longer afford it. Stop using it until this year, and I decided to go back. $150 for the middle bottle which lasts about 3 months. When I started learning about K-skin care, I wanted to find a copy cat of SK-II&#x27;s Essence and hopefully it would be cheaper. I read a review about it on the Wanderlust blog and figured it was good to go. So, I tried samples first. Didn&#x27;t see or really feel any big deal. So, I went ahead and bought the larger bottle when my SK-II ran out. Boy am I glad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my SK-II but cheaper, slightly thicker in product feel but my skin seems to drink this stuff up right after I wash and tone. I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin looking &#x27;brighter&#x27; or pore reduction, but does feel moisturized, and smother.  I would seriously suggest anyone looking to add an essence to their gazillion step K-skin care routine to consider this.</li>
    <li> My skin looks clearer, which I noticed after 3 days. By clearer it&#x27;s not necessarily that my skin discolorations noticeably changed, but  maybe it was a culmination of micro-discolorations fading. There wasn&#x27;t a specific aspect that I could point out as having faded or changed, but there was an overall brightness  to my face and neck. This did make my skin a little bit more sensitive. Definitely put on a layer of moisturizer after the essence. I found that scented moisturizer stung, so that ruled out using other Korean products. With the addition of just this one product, I feel pretty positive about the way my skin looks, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect any miracles.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and so far I do like it. It&#x27;s sort of a toner/serum/moisturizer all in one. It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;The First Treatment&amp;#34; Essence because it&#x27;s supposed to be the first step in your skin care routine, right after cleansing. Directions state to apply this by patting onto the skin using a cotton pad, but I prefer using my hands so as not to waste product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very faint hoppy/beer-like smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and dissipates rather quickly. The consistency is very light (almost water-like, but a little more viscous. It takes about 30 seconds for my skin to absorb it. I like how hydrating it feels. Those with very dry skin may not find it to be hydrating enough, but if you&#x27;re very oily like me, this may be sufficient enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day, and I do notice an improvement in my skin tone -- post-acne hyperpigmentation marks seem to be fading faster with this. My pores also look a little bit cleaner and smaller (I do use a salicylic acid treatment as well, and I think they complement each other nicely). I don&#x27;t rely on this product specifically to fight acne, but more to moisturize, brighten my complexion, and prep my skin for other treatments in my routine. It comes in a big glass bottle, which is attractive, but heavy -- not quite travel friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to get rid of pimples, this isn&#x27;t it. But if you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight treatment to help even out your skin tone and refine your complexion while offering non-heavy moisture, this may be worth looking into.</li>
    <li> Great essence-a little bit is more than enough to hydrate the skin-my skin is glowing since I have been using this product-the bottle lasts long too!</li>
    <li> very watery ,i assumed essence was a bit like a serum,but its more like a toner,its actually quite moisturizing. I have used it about two weeks now,i have not seen any brightening,or noticed anything different with my skin,i like it as a toner and will continue to use until its empty. If i notice any results after this,then i may repurchase,but for now its just ok.</li>
    <li> After 3rd packet decided to purchase full size, expecting delivery soon. It feels great on skin and no break outs, hope to see more improvements with usage.</li>
    <li> I was using the SK-II, but I think this is similar.  Look at the ingredients and this lotion has more ingredients and all natural.  Fraction of price of SK-II.  Maybe will switch off between this one and the more expensive. Leaves skin feeling clear, moisturized and no breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever! It leaves your skin smooth, soft, and moisturized. It is absorbed into your skin very fast. I can even compare it with SK-II. It functions exactly same ways but the price is much more economical. I am so glad that US market finally have the skin.</li>
    <li> While the product may be fine, the cap design is awful.  The cap is so poorly design that a piece of the internal reinforcement came off upon opening the product.  The cap&#x27;s screw design is so loose and the two reinforcement mechanism on the inside are so small, now I can&#x27;t even lock the cap which means it will never travel with me or I may risk it spilling everywhere.  To spend all this money and not be able to take a simple bottle with me is not good at all.  Please redesign the cap!  How can you screw up a simple cap design?</li>
    <li> I notice an improvement in my skin since adding this to my routine. I feel like my skin is smoother and the few dark spots that I have seem to have faded. The smell isn&#x27;t bad and you get a lot of product. I like to put this on my hand and then pat my hands together and then pat it on my face. I don&#x27;t like to use cotton pads, but some may want to do that with this so they don&#x27;t lose product.</li>
    <li> It would be better in a spray form</li>
    <li> I have clear skin naturally so I use this as a substitute for cleanser in the morning, when I don&#x27;t need to remove any makeup but I want to freshen up before moisturizing. Works like a charm, my skin feels cool and clean and ready to absorb my serum and lotion. No idea if the other beauty claims stand up, but I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra on the off chance they make a difference. My only concern is how quickly I seem to be using up the bottle, we&#x27;ll see if I stick with this or switch to something slightly cheaper once I reach the end. But for now I couldn&#x27;t be happier. If you&#x27;re curious, definitely try it out.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product but unfortunately I fall into the minority of people whose skin it destroyed. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve worked hard to fine tune my routine to clear up some persistent acne. With my skin finally clear, I decided to introduce this product into my routine hoping that it would help with brightening and evening out my skin tone. Within 24 hours of using this product (two applications), I looked in the mirror to find my face red and irritated, with lots of little whiteheads all over my cheeks and forehead. I stopped using this product and my skin started clearing up. This product is definitely not for everyone, and if you do decide to try make sure that you can get a refund if it doesn&#x27;t work out!</li>
    <li> I like Korean skin care. I did try sk-11 , I think this is great for the price. I have been using it for past few weeks , I think my skin is softer. I will continue to end of bottle. I will look into more from this line. Try it!</li>
    <li> It has given vitality to my skin althoug the smell is strange I like the effects very much. Definitely improved my overall skin without breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is a dupe for the SK-II pitera essence. I have not used SK-II so I cannot make a comparance. The texture is water like. The scent is barely detectable to me. I have to purposefully try in order to smell it. You are suppose to use this product immediately following the cleansing portion of your routine. I pour some into my palm and apply to my face, neck and décolletage. Tap your skin with your fingers until the essence is completely absorbed. I use this product twice a day. I have pretty good skin already but I do see a brightening and deeper hydration to my skin in combination with my other products. There I just something about this product. I really like it and will but the bigger bottle next. I believe its better to prevent than to have to try and correct. I recommend purchasing from the missha US site. Their prices are better.</li>
    <li> Everything it is supposed to be.</li>
    <li> This huge bottle is going to last forever.  I don&#x27;t use a cotton ball or pad, but rather apply this with my fingers after shaking several drops onto my hand.  It&#x27;s the second step of my skin-care routine, after toner, and before snail recovery gel and moisturizer.  Suprisingly, as soon as I apply it, my skin feels more smooth and silky, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  Definitely worth the money, as my skin, after 3 weeks of a 5-step regime of Korean skin care products, looks about 15 years younger!</li>
    <li> Once I added this essence into my skin regime, I noticed a significant different in my skin texture. Now it is way softer and it feels so refreshing. I don&#x27;t use much but it has given me a wonderful glow.</li>
    <li> It is not like SK II, and I was dissapointed in the lack of results. I will continue with essence in the future.</li>
    <li> I like the packaging of the bottle. Its smooth and its a good size. There&#x27;s been lots of hypes in the korean skincare market about fermented essence and this one and SK-II were one of the top brands for it. But with SK-II being so expensive, I opted for this one instead. My skin type, I have combo-oily and dry skin. Its only been 2-3 weeks now and I have noticed a little difference but nothing major. It has somewhat smoothed out some of my wrinkle areas around my chin and forehead, but not too dramatic. I use it some mornings and mostly at night. But the good thing is that it hasn&#x27;t broken me out horribly or anything. I will continue to use this and I hope to see some good results soon in the next month or so.</li>
    <li> I received an expired bottle and the few days I did use it (before I noticed it was expired) I heavily broke out with cystic acne. I gave it a two star because it does make your face glow and youthful. I wont be purchasing again since I ended up with the acne and it took me over a month to clear up that little problem.</li>
    <li> Bottom of my bottle had a manufacture date of 2/14/2015. I received it in May of 2015 so mine was legit. No more flaky skin, fills pores so that it looks smaller (I have large pores), radiant brighter skin, no breakouts, not oily. Didn&#x27;t help my hyperpigmentation/rosacea. I have combo skin and live in sunny California. I also use it with toner, serum, and emulsion. I believe this combo of  products work well together.</li>
    <li> Subtle and effective. Like a probiotic for your skin. Used to breakout regularly and now my skin is clear like it hasn&#x27;t been in years. I use it after washing my face in the morning--sometimes I need additional moisturizing and use face oil but mostly not--and then again after removing my makeup in the evening. Still use my night time product before going to sleep.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the SK-II version of this product which is obscenely expensive, however, it worked. This product does not. With the SK-II product, I had crystal clear skin. This product has done nothing at all for my mild acne, in fact it seems worse. In addition, I have not noticed more youthful looking skin like I did with the other product. I had very high hopes. I bought two bottles of this. But I would not buy it Again. It Just doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m sad.</li>
    <li> I heard that this was a dupe for SKII so I had to get it and so far it has made a huge difference to my skin. My face is softer, even, last redness. Overall I don&#x27;t think I can go without it. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> For starters, I never leave reviews. On anything. But the world needs to know about Missha Time Revolution the First Treatment Essence.&lt;br /&gt;This is an absolutely amazing product- all the reviews that you read are true. My skin has never looked so bright, refreshed and healthy... Even my Dad commented on it. I haven&#x27;t been sleeping very much at all recently, but every day my skin looks like it&#x27;s had a good 12 hour rest. It&#x27;s really incredible.&lt;br /&gt;My pores are reduced, my skin is firmer.&lt;br /&gt;Stop reading reviews. Buy this product now.</li>
    <li> My skin finally stopped breaking out about 8 months ago. But I still had some hyper pigmentation and wanted to refine my pores a bit more, and I heard rave reviews for TR (time rev) so I decided to get it. I thought it was good, seemed to make my scars lighten after just one night, although that might&#x27;ve just been illusory (I really, really wanted it to work), it had only been one night (3 uses) after all. I started to notice that I had a few tiny spots on my chin, about 3, but they were so small I didn&#x27;t really care, that was easy to manage. Plus, if I ever got breakouts, they were on my chin, so this wasnt *too* unusual. This morning I saw a few more on my chin and cheeks. I thought this was a bit strange but still couldn&#x27;t be definite that it wasn&#x27;t just my skin behaving normally. Tonight, I just checked my face about half hour after I used TR, and noticed spots ALL over my face. What stood out was the ones on my forehead, which was the only place that had completely cleared up of acne and hyperpigmentation since it had been so long since I broke out there. It was now covered in these little spots! I went from having nearly clear skin and a couple tiny spots of hyperpigmentation to a face full of little spots in just 2 days!! Argh. Learn from my mistakes, although if I was you I&#x27;d still want to try it because surely I wouldn&#x27;t be that one person who broke out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for those curious, the date on the bottom of the box is the manufactured date, not the expiration date. Mine was manufactured July 12, 2014, and since it has a 9 month life span, would have expired by March 12, only a month away! And I only received it yesterday. How am I supposed to use this much product within a month??</li>
    <li> I have noticed improvements in the brightness of my skin since using this after I double cleanse and apply my Missha toner. My skin tone has evened out as well. Good product.</li>
    <li> I have discovered that fermented products work really well with my combo/acne-prone skin. This one has done great things for me in just a few weeks. When I first started using it I had a lot of scarring from a recent breakout. This product has dramatically reduced the scarring and overall improved the texture of my skin. My only complaint is that it is kind of sticky once applied.</li>
    <li> I love this, but the bottle broke about a week after I got it :&#x27;( I knocked it over off the sink counter.. sigh. So sad.</li>
    <li> This essence is the best I&#x27;ve tried! I&#x27;ve used Hera and Iope essences and this one is better. I&#x27;ve heard this one is similar to the expensive SKII. I notice a difference in the clarity of my skin and the texture has improved. It even feels very refreshing when you put it on after a shower. I use mine on a cotton pad to apply it easier. My bottle is still 2/3 full and I have been using it since mid-December. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a watery hydrating essence.  I haven&#x27;t seen anything miraculous happen but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my finicky skin and feels good.</li>
    <li> I watched a short video on the 18 steps Korean women do every night to achieve beautiful skin. In it they use 2 different toners. I had some of my own toner left when this product arrived so I decided to try the Korean technique. I was actually shocked to see that my own pricey toner was not removing all that my soap had left behind. Missha removes every trace of extras leftover after cleansing, leaving my face ready for serum. The product smells nice and definitely does its job. I would order again!</li>
    <li> I only use this product 3x per week and already see my brown spots disappear! May work better for fair skinned people as I&#x27;m olive complexed and see an overall lightening to my skin tone (my face is a touch lighted than my shoulders and chest).</li>
    <li> it moistures your skin really well..I love it!</li>
    <li> So in love with this wonderful product</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this toner! I was debating between purchasing the skii essence and this one, but based on different reviews it sounded like people were actually happier with this one. This toner has helped even out my complexion and lighten my dark spots/acne scars, but most of all it has visibly reduced the size of my pores. I no longer wear foundation. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s is soft. My skin became more delicate.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It gives my skin a supple and smooth finish</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it has done anything but I like it and use it twice daily.</li>
    <li> I had issues with Rosacea and nothing would help me for the last two years.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a lot of different stuff for sensitive-very dry skin but it was making red bumps to spread on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect for taking pretty good skin- not breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice after about 2 weeks of use that my skin&#x27;s texture was way softer,&lt;br /&gt;most significantly my skin tone and clarity was noticiably boosted.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks way more glowy now!!!yay~~~&lt;br /&gt;That is the greatest difference and this is the only product that boosted my radiance in any noticable way.&lt;br /&gt; I look like I&#x27;m wearing BB cream even with no makeup on.&lt;br /&gt; Didn&#x27;t break me out or anything.  works great. i&#x27;m totally satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;will continue to use and recommend to my friends:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but I haven&#x27;t seen big difference. Maybe because its winter and my skin is extra dry. But I feel like I need more hydration.</li>
    <li> I feel like this is exactly the same as SK-II only SO much cheaper. Very gentle, noticeably improves skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
    <li> Be careful using this product! I applied using a cotton pad, and the essence leaked through and touched my fingers. The next day, my fingers were blistering and peeling. I wasn&#x27;t 100% positive that this was causing my fingers to peel. So then I tried using the palm technique, in which you put the essence on your palms and apply it on your face. The next day my upper palms also began to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I had to stop using this because of my peeling hands, and I never got to see the benefits that the reviews here outline. It has been 2 weeks since I last used this, and my fingers are still peeling. So be careful with this product! It might not be gentle to the skin on your hands.</li>
    <li> This is my first essense I have ever used and I will never stop using this. Not kidding...this stuff is amazing! I put it on using my palms and then top with a night repair serum. My face has only improved since this product. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This poor review is for the product - NOT the seller. I had no issue with the seller - the item looks genuine and there were no issues with shipping. However, I am really disappointed in the product itself. I usually have normal to slightly dry skin in the summer, and for sure have a dry forehead and in general dry skin in the winter. It is winter and using a small amount of this essence makes my skin quite oily. Any other product I use with it just compounds the oiliness (you are supposed to use this first, then apply the rest of your skin routine per the instructions). I can&#x27;t figure out how to use this without having an oily result. I can&#x27;t imagine how oily my skin would be in summer if I used this. And I am only using very gentle cleansers so it&#x27;s not like my skin is trying to compensate with adding more oil. So sad as this had such great reviews. And I have had a rash of acne on my forehead since using this.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and am glad I added it to my skincare. Over the course of a few weeks, my skin tone looks more even and I haven&#x27;t had any noticeable breakouts. HOWEVER, this product is intended to be used as one step in a multiple-product skincare process; don&#x27;t just use this on skin that is dry or goes unmoisturized. You should probably test this on a small part of your skin before committing to it because it does contain yeast, and this could be irritating to some skin types. I have sensitive skin, and while I have never had a problem with this irritating my skin during regular weather conditions, after one particularly dry and cold day I used this product after washing my face with a regular cleanser and it irritated a few dryer patches on my face. I use a cleansing oil now, especially when the weather is dry, and I have never had a problem since.</li>
    <li> Nice, it doesn&#x27;t gave a harmful effect on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> why did I not buy this any sooner?  another key item for your skin regimen.  I apply this after my toner and it&#x27;s marvelous.  missha, you&#x27;ve done it again.</li>
    <li> This product seems to have a lot of hype, so I was really exited to try it, but also ready to be skeptical.  The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t so impressed, and it kind of irritated my skin.  But since then, I haven&#x27;t had any irritation, it has been very soothing.  I don&#x27;t know all the ins and outs, n of Korean products- I am just starting to learn.  But this essence seems to be kind of like a toner, but a moisturizing toner instead of an astringent one.  I use it right after washing my face, when it is still just slightly damp, morning and night.  I shake about a half teaspoon into my hand and pat it into my face and neck, and wait for it to dry/absorb, which takes about 2 minutes. I couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly why, but I just love it.  It&#x27;s my favorite part of my routine.  It seems very simple but also luxurious at the same time, and my skin seems very radiant right after I use it, and it seems more even after a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Authentic product. Works well for adding and retaining moisture.</li>
</ol>
