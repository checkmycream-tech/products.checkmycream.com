      <li>Better than the store/generic brands.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I always buy Q-Tip brand cotton swabs because their quality is/was better.  </li>
      <li>have used them for many years&lt;</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use a pencil, Popsicle stick, cats paw, spatula, screwdriver, or even a fat pinky when a Q-Tip can do the job better.  </li>
      <li>Tips have so many purposes quite frankly I&#x27;m astounded.</li>
      <li>Here are some uses I have found them good for:&lt;br /&gt;- first aid</li>
      <li>They are genuine Q Tips, don&#x27;t come any better.</li>
      <li>Good quality Q tips, very versatile</li>
      <li>Ahhhh, the good people at Q-Tips really out did themselves on this pack.</li>
      <li>Best swab items available on the market, other competitors are inconsistene in softness and full swab wrap!  </li>
      <li>Also inside car care to fine detail areas.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Tips are such a great product.</li>
      <li>These are very useful, just keep them out of your ears.</li>
      <li>I tried buying cheap off-brand cotton swabs, and there&#x27;s just no way those get my ears clean.  </li>
      <li>AND IT IS GOOD AND WORTH THE MONEY.WILL BUY MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
      <li>The large package, at a good price, is very convenient.</li>
      <li>I like to use them to clean up eye make on my face and also to get pesky ear wax.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34; as you gently clean them.  </li>
      <li>I love their versatility and I will certainly buy them again.</li>
      <li>I feel very fulfilled when I saw the pack with that many cotton swabs in it.</li>
      <li>Package arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
      <li>Q-tips have just the right strength to clean out an ear.</li>
      <li>Q-tips are totally worth the bit of extra money, because you have to use twice as many of the cheapo ones, and they still don&#x27;t work as well!  </li>
      <li>Outstanding at nearly every level.  </li>
      <li>Buy these Q-Tips today and smile with your family.</li>
      <li>A nice big tub of 750 Q-tips</li>
      <li>These q-tips work for everything from keeping my computer clean to gently applying ointments.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to run down to the corner to get them.</li>
      <li>Arrived as described and much cheaper than @</li>
      <li>My last box of Q-tips claimed to have “50% more soft cotton at the tip”.</li>
      <li>Good for the price, but the tips are much smaller than the other Q-tips we&#x27;ve been using.</li>
      <li>They are cushioning and you don&#x27;t feel the sticks beneath the cotton, as you do in so many other brands.  </li>
      <li>Their stem is sturdy and does not bend and fold so easily like other cotton swabs.</li>
      <li>Stick to the real deal, the original, the one and only, the softest cottony swab with a stout enough stick that won&#x27;t bend or break mid-ear-cleaning.  </li>
      <li>They can be used for just about everything: cleaning ears, applying makeup, putting creams and ointments in just the right spot, putting on lipstick, cleaning hard to reach places in kitchen and bath, artistic painting, touch up painting, just about anything you can think of!</li>
      <li>BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY NEW APARTMENT AND FOUND THE VALUE AND PRICE</li>
      <li>The tips are always soft and have &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34; cotton.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t push them in too far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is the first time I ordered such a big box--and will do it again</li>
      <li>I live in a 2 person household and we will duke it out over who used the last of the Q-Tips.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re able to zip lock a few for weekend getaway,share with other family members and still have plenty!</li>

<li> The consistently get the job done with minimal resistance and few complaints.  </li>
<li> The sticks are firm and sturdy, but not hard.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll probably have to buy from another seller next time if they don&#x27;t go back down.</li>
<li> The cotton doesn&#x27;t tend to pull loose and lint like some others.  </li>

<li> They are typically not very sturdy and/or have almost no cotton on the tip.  </li>
<li> They are usually not strong enough, and bend when any pressure is applied.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My ears love these things!</li>
    <li> great price.  These are always needed items.</li>
    <li> When I received the package, its wrapper has already been opened. Some of the inside QTips were soiled. Really frustrating!</li>
    <li> Great product luckily iy was sold on Amazon or I wouldn&#x27;t be using this out in Africa.</li>
    <li> I prefer Q Tips over all other cotton swabs for the feel of them.  They are cushioning and you don&#x27;t feel the sticks beneath the cotton, as you do in so many other brands.  This padding is also helpful when using cotton swabs for other purposes in cleaning with them, too.</li>
    <li> As described by seller!</li>
    <li> Good for the price, but the tips are much smaller than the other Q-tips we&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> These q-tips work for everything from keeping my computer clean to gently applying ointments. I love their versatility and I will certainly buy them again.</li>
    <li> Q-Tips to me are the ultimate luxury and they should never be taken for granted. I live in a 2 person household and we will duke it out over who used the last of the Q-Tips. Q- Tips have so many purposes quite frankly I&#x27;m astounded. I like to use them to clean up eye make on my face and also to get pesky ear wax. They are also very handy for using with nail polish remover as well. Q- Tips are such a great product.</li>
    <li> My last box of Q-tips claimed to have “50% more soft cotton at the tip”. I thought I was buying the same product. However, after receiving I noticed this new package does not make that claim and these &amp;#34;Q-Tips&amp;#34; appear to have at least 50% less cotton. However, the price was good and I got what I paid for. They should last for a long time due to the high quantity.&lt;br /&gt;Even though Unilever has reduced the quality of the product while continuing to sell under the Q-Tips brand name, Unilever still has a good reputation for environmental responsibility, etc.... and the product is made in USA.</li>
    <li> I always buy Q-Tip brand cotton swabs because their quality is/was better.  These have proven that that is no longer the case.</li>
    <li> They get the job done. Only q-tips I use. Sturdy and cotton doesn&#x27;t disintegrate as soon as you use it.</li>
    <li> A nice big tub of 750 Q-tips, what&#x27;s not to like? Swabs arrived in perfect condition as one would expect.</li>
    <li> Q-Tips.  Outstanding at nearly every level.  The consistently get the job done with minimal resistance and few complaints.  Ahhhh, the good people at Q-Tips really out did themselves on this pack.</li>
    <li> The cotton doesn&#x27;t tend to pull loose and lint like some others.  I wish the price wouldn&#x27;t fluctuate, though.  I&#x27;ll probably have to buy from another seller next time if they don&#x27;t go back down.</li>
    <li> This size package is a great value !  You&#x27;re able to zip lock a few for weekend getaway,share with other family members and still have plenty!</li>
    <li> This is a Great inexpensive way to buy Q-tips.  They came quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This brand has the best cotton swab on the market.</li>
    <li> Well enough made.  The stems are not as strong as they used to be, but the cotton tips are as good as they get.  recommended.</li>
    <li> Bulk supply is great.  I don&#x27;t have to watch for coupons or the weekly flyers to look for good deals.  The bulk discount equals or exceeds coupon savings and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my supply for months.</li>
    <li> Q-Tips are the best available cotton swabs out there.  Their stem is sturdy and does not bend and fold so easily like other cotton swabs.</li>
    <li> Other cotton swabs just don&#x27;t cut it. They are usually not strong enough, and bend when any pressure is applied. Q-tips have just the right strength to clean out an ear.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands and hate them.  They are typically not very sturdy and/or have almost no cotton on the tip.  For some reason, however, I have a hard time finding Q-Tip brand swabs at the store.  I find cottons swabs, but they are all house brand, and I have to go searching through several aisles to figure out where they hid the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; cotton swabs.  Now, at least for a year or so, I won&#x27;t have to go hunting.  :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t you dare give me a cotton swab or a generic brand.  Go with the best, go with Q-Tips.  K?</li>
    <li> Good quality Q tips, very versatile</li>
    <li> These are the best Qtips and I trust the brand and quality.  I never have problems with them and I would recommend them to anyone that needs them.  The large package, at a good price, is very convenient.</li>
    <li> Quality item. Large quantity at a great price. I&#x27;m very pleased! Will be keeping these on my subscribe and save!</li>
    <li> I feel very fulfilled when I saw the pack with that many cotton swabs in it. All are very clean and good to use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t understand how there could be a problem with q-tips, but then the box arrived and it was not sealed.  As poor quality and shipping standards seems to be the norm with Amazon now, I will no longer use it for buying anything other than books.</li>
    <li> I tried buying cheap off-brand cotton swabs, and there&#x27;s just no way those get my ears clean.  Q-tips are totally worth the bit of extra money, because you have to use twice as many of the cheapo ones, and they still don&#x27;t work as well!  This is the largest package I&#x27;ve purchased, and I&#x27;m glad to be able to stock up!</li>
    <li> These are very useful, just keep them out of your ears. Seriously folks you can harm your hearing that way.&lt;br /&gt;I use them in various ways and only Q tip brand because they don&#x27;t fall apart like non brand name swabs I have used before. Here are some uses I have found them good for:&lt;br /&gt;- first aid&lt;br /&gt;- hygiene (belly button &amp; ear piercing care.)&lt;br /&gt;- cleaning  especially tricky jobs tile, AC window units, O2 concentrator, electronics&lt;br /&gt;- refrigerator gaskets a bit of bleach and some Q tips bye bye mold.&lt;br /&gt;-cleaning a car door gaskets and window tracks. Also inside car care to fine detail areas.&lt;br /&gt;- make up applicator or remover&lt;br /&gt;- arts and crafts&lt;br /&gt;Are the few that springs to mind I always seem to for get them while at the store.... I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Have been buying for years.  Better than the store/generic brands. Would buy again.  Use them for for all sorts of things, such as cleaning corners of the kitchen counter tops.</li>
    <li> uThere are no cotton swabs like Q-tips! I have tried the cheaper brands over the years and I always regretted it. I use Q-tips every day of my life and have for dozens of years! I should buy stock in the company! This is the standard which no one else has ever met. The tips are always soft and have &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34; cotton. The sticks are firm and sturdy, but not hard. They can be used for just about everything: cleaning ears, applying makeup, putting creams and ointments in just the right spot, putting on lipstick, cleaning hard to reach places in kitchen and bath, artistic painting, touch up painting, just about anything you can think of!</li>
    <li> There is more cotton on end of the swabs than cheaper brands... perfect! Plus, with subscribe and save these are cheaper than I can purchase at Wal-Mart or similar stores.</li>
    <li> What  is to say? Q-tip have been around for years and it is hard to see how any family could function without them. Q-tips are a&lt;br /&gt;staple in our cabinets.</li>
    <li> Good Prices, GREAT Products And FAST Shipping, Thank You VERY MUCH !!!!!!</li>
    <li> They are q-tips,  what else can I say?</li>
    <li> great product and delivery</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t push them in too far.</li>
    <li> great for make up and applying medication&lt;br /&gt;I have used them for many years&lt;br /&gt;It is the first time I ordered such a big box--and will do it again</li>
    <li> I always buy these been using since I was a baby and now I use them through out my family</li>
    <li> A review for Qtips?  Who doesn&#x27;t know what Qtips are?  If you want a lifetime supply, this is it!  It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to run down to the corner to get them.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY NEW APARTMENT AND FOUND THE VALUE AND PRICE TO BE A GOOD DEAL AND I HAVE USE THIS PRODUCT AND IT IS GOOD AND WORTH THE MONEY.WILL BUY MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>

Stick to the real deal, the original, the one and only, the softest cottony swab with a stout enough stick that won&#x27;t bend or break mid-ear-cleaning.  750 chances to make your ears say &amp;#34;Ahhhhhh....&amp;#34; as you gently clean them.  Don&#x27;t use a pencil, Popsicle stick, cats paw, spatula, screwdriver, or even a fat pinky when a Q-Tip can do the job better.  Buy these Q-Tips today and smile with your family.</li>
    <li> What can I say a q tip is a qtip. You need them and they r there.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described and much cheaper than @ my local market. Was surprised at all of the negative feedback/reviews. These are Q-Tips, they are the name-brand and work great. Very happy with my purchase...although I work for a hospital system and will be trying the &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; tips next as I have heard great things about them too...just went with my known commodity this time.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with a giant package of QTips!  Package arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
    <li> Use these all the time with my makeup and stuff.</li>
    <li> They are genuine Q Tips, don&#x27;t come any better.</li>
    <li> Qtip box was covered in something like vaseline... messy</li>
    <li> Best swab items available on the market, other competitors are inconsistene in softness and full swab wrap!  As the pirates used to say; &amp;#34;alrightee yee swabbeess&amp;#34;... oh er maybe that&#x27;s not what they said?  Save here an buy these!</li>
