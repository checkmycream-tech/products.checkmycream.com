      <li>I was pleasantly surprised it provides a nice stain of color that lasts a long time and also makes your lips feel super soft.  </li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t like the look of this.  </li>
      <li>Most ladies have a ton of these &#x27;long wearing&#x27; lipsticks or stains that just don&#x27;t live up to their hype.</li>

      <li>It actually stains and works but the color was more of a RED color.</li>
      <li>I would totally recommend this to my friends and to anyone who wants a fresh new look.</li>
      <li>Have clean, exfoliated lips, and let it dry.</li>
      <li>other Maybelline products I ordered are fine with usage.</li>
      <li>Can dry out the lips, but chap stick can fix that right up!</li>
      <li>but I wish it didn&#x27;t dry so quick</li>
      <li>Very much worth the money though, as the color turned out to be what I expected!</li>
      <li>The color isn&#x27;t harsh, but true to the lid color.</li>
      <li>I like this lip stain, it really makes my lip red and it stays on for a long time.</li>
      <li>I wish I had gone a shade lighter though because this is a pretty dark color.</li>

<li> not a good buy....</li>

<li> Very uncomfortable when worn-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My everyday look is like Emma Watson. few coats of mascara and redish lip color. This color is probably the best thing ever. And it does not smudge, at ALL!!! Tip: put lip balm before you put this on. It applies more smoothly.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say that my boyfriend wore it, as well! It&#x27;s nice if you won&#x27;t be kissing anyone, though.</li>
    <li> I love the bold color and smell of the stain. It was like a marker, but it was a tad drying so I had to put balm over it. But I would buy another color.</li>
    <li> I really like the color; I&#x27;ve got light brown skin and it goes well. The only problem I have with it is it wearing off after a couple of hours, but it does a nice color once it stains.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color and makes a great winter color to coordinate with your red sweaters and such.  It is a stain, so you will want to make sure you take it off with a make up remover. use lip balm and or gloss over it to keep it moist and shiny. If you like a bright lip color, this is for  you. It is a berry red, but does not carry all the blue of purplish pigments that can make a lip stain or stick seem to purple.</li>
    <li> I like this lip stain, it really makes my lip red and it stays on for a long time. I don&#x27;t have to wear lipstick, because it is better than lipstick.</li>
    <li> I have never used a lip stain before but at a price of around $2 shipped this was the time to try. I absolutely love the color (cranberry crush). My lips did look the color of cranberries when freshly applied but I didn&#x27;t feel like it stained my lips. The color faded in the center of my lips before the edges. My lips did not stain a cranberry color it just looked like I wiped off red lipstick and was left with a slight pinkish residue. I do feel like its user error like I&#x27;m just not applying it right, i will keep trying though. All in all I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase because ot the color and I don&#x27;t mind if i have to use it as a lipstick instead of a stain.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these of different shade lighter and darker, but colors were still the same. Plus its dry.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the color and how easy it goes on. Doesn&#x27;t smear and color actually lasts the entire day!</li>
    <li> The product came 2 days before the estimated delivery date. I love it! Very bold and nice color. Amazing! I would totally recommend this to my friends and to anyone who wants a fresh new look.</li>
    <li> I love this lip stain a lot. The color is great, it stays on for a long time, and when I do finally want to remove it, it isn&#x27;t a hassle. The only thing that&#x27;s keeping it from 5 stars is that if you dont store it standing up it takes a while for the stuff to get flowing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the colour, I didn&#x27;t like that it bled almost seconds after letting it dry and then licking my lips to test it&#x27;s staying power...not a good buy....I can see why this sold for so cheap...will not ever buy this product again!</li>
    <li> For some reason I thought it was going to be a lip gloss but its a MARKER. It actually stains and works but the color was more of a RED color.</li>
    <li> I love the color, but the pen drys out really quick! I love it though! Love the color with cream colored skin</li>
    <li> i have every color. love them! they last all day, great colors. THERE PERFECT. great fall colors, and also, they dont fade throught out the day</li>
    <li> Excellent products delivery was fast no complain</li>
    <li> It works pretty good.  The color isn&#x27;t my favorite but I put on colored lip gloss anyway.</li>
    <li> I love the color but I wish it didn&#x27;t dry so quick so I have time to move it around</li>
    <li> dislike that this stain makes my lips feel tacky and peel once it has dried. Probably works for other folks quite well, however. Very uncomfortable when worn- will not re-order this stain but other Maybelline products I ordered are fine with usage.</li>
    <li> I thought this lip stain would last way longer. It stays for maybe a couple hours, and it especially cakes up around the edges of my lips, so I end up looking like the Joker. Maybe I&#x27;m not putting it on right or something. The color is beautiful, I just wish it would actually stain my lips rather than running all about.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but I really don&#x27;t like the look of this.  It looks like I&#x27;ve been drinking Koolaid or something.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used lip stain so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the way it is supposed to look but I&#x27;m not happy with it.</li>
    <li> Most ladies have a ton of these &#x27;long wearing&#x27; lipsticks or stains that just don&#x27;t live up to their hype. This product works. Take care and apply it like the other reviewer explained. Have clean, exfoliated lips, and let it dry. The color isn&#x27;t harsh, but true to the lid color. I have thin lips and it&#x27;s hard to use color without looking odd. This does it! I will by more.</li>
    <li> It literally stays on all day i woke up the next morning after wearing it and it was still there! so amazing i will be buying so many more colors!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I have tried lipstain before when they 1st came out and did not like it as there was no color payout.  After trying Maybelline&#x27;s Lipstain I was pleasantly surprised it provides a nice stain of color that lasts a long time and also makes your lips feel super soft.  If I put this on around 7:30 am I usually don&#x27;t have to reapply until after lunch.  This color is on the darker side it kind of looks like you where eating a red popsicle and stained your lips ( I like it).  The only down side is the tube is not squeezable so you have to push on the top to get the color to come out.  I find if I store it with the tip facing down it works better.  I would like to try this in another shade.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this product. It may not last as long as id like but the color is truly beautiful.</li>
    <li> Works well! I love it! It is the color it says it is even. That was a surprise. I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> It looked nice for like an hour then it started to rub off. I thought it was supposed to last longer</li>
    <li> It dried up the second week.</li>
    <li> As a lip stain, I expected it to last longer.  If the lip isn&#x27;t totally dry, almost cracked, it doesn&#x27;t last on me.  If I use anything else on it, like gloss, it easily comes off.  Then, I find it hard to apply, the color doesn&#x27;t come on evenly.</li>
    <li> I remember ordering Cranberry Crush for a lower price, but I guess it&#x27;s gone up. Very much worth the money though, as the color turned out to be what I expected! It&#x27;s rich and has a red/purple/pink mixture that matches a cranberry color. CONS: It stains on well but sometimes can be darker or lighter in places. Also, if you were to eat, it&#x27;d come off too. Can dry out the lips, but chap stick can fix that right up! Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product! I would definitely buy this same color again for my lips!</li>
    <li> The product goes on very easily so don&#x27;t over due it when you apply it. I wish I had gone a shade lighter though because this is a pretty dark color. I wear it when I know I&#x27;m not going to want to be worried about touching my lipstick up</li>
    <li> Loved the lip stain! the color was just beautiful and gave a nice matte finish that just popped. The only downside is that it wears off pretty easily. Other than that, I love both the scent and the color, was skeptical at first because it does look and feel like a marker lol, but overall it is a nice product.</li>
