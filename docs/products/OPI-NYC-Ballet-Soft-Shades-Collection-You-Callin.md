      <li>I noticed it faded fast and chipped.</li>

      <li>And just because you haven&#x27;t received complaints doesn&#x27;t mean the product was in good condition, some people are just too lazy to follow up and complain.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The bottle is pretty defective it leaks every time it&#x27;s laid over. In the package it was also leaked</li>
    <li> Wife loves this polish. She does her own manicures at home. She said it&#x27;s perfect for a french manicure. Will but again for her.</li>
    <li> A &amp;#34;Lyre&amp;#34; is the symbol for the sororiety Alpha Chi Omega. We searched locally for this color when my daughter pledged last year to no avail. When I saw it online I ordered two, one for my daughter, and one for her&amp;#34;Little&amp;#34; this year.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and with no issues.</li>
    <li> I had to put on several coats for this to actually cover my nail. But I do love the color!</li>
    <li> I am in love with OPI nail polish and this one did not disappoint me.  It is a very nice neutral color.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is very, very sheer, and you would need about 10 coats to make the color of the polish in the bottle.  If you like really sheer, you will like this.  I do not like polish that appears to be a color, but really has NO color, so this is a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - of course, it&#x27;s OPI. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this if you want a subtle colour.</li>
    <li> I love this pale, sheer, color. For me it works well with one coat (plus top coat) because it perfectly matches my skin color. Two coats are lovely as well, just more opaque. The standard OPI quality that lasts without chipping for a long time. I used OPI Natural Nail Base Coat and Top Coat and it&#x27;s been on for 5 days now in perfect condition with one additional top coat. I have used OPI nail polish for more years thatn I care to admit to- always with great results.</li>
    <li> This is a very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking nail color. I thought that the color was more of a pink tone. I like it. I received&lt;br /&gt;the polish sooner than I expected. Overall, good experience.</li>
    <li> I had to have this color.  It looks really great if you are just looking for a clean natural look.  I suggest 3 coats.</li>
    <li> I received this item and the color was great for French nail polish.  I applied it and left for vacation. I noticed it faded fast and chipped. I order OPI nail polishes all the time from Amazon and I never had an issue. So the day I came back I emailed Customer Service and said this: \\&quot;Hi there, I ordered the nail polish above.  I used it before my trip and just came back so I did not have time to email this sooner.  I noticed that it chipped pretty fast&lt;br /&gt;compared to the other OPI nail polishes I have bought from Amazon.  Could I have&lt;br /&gt;received one from a bad batch?  Please let me know.  Thank you.\\&quot;  Then I received the reply: \\&quot;We do not believe it is from bad batch as we have sold many OPI nail polishes and have no other complaints.\\&quot;  So no I&#x27;m sorry about that or maybe you got one bad one but just says No I disagree with you and too bad!  How rude and apparently this company doesn&#x27;t care to fix an issue and continues on to be rude after I was very kind with my request. And just because you haven&#x27;t received complaints doesn&#x27;t mean the product was in good condition, some people are just too lazy to follow up and complain.  Probably came from a warehouse in China and they could care less.  I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN AND WILL REPORT TO BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU</li>
    <li> This color is so pretty and is perfect for that &amp;#34;slight&amp;#34; color on your nails.  Love OPI Products! Perfect for summer &amp; spring</li>
    <li> I love OPI polish!  This shade is so pretty and neutral.  I use to get Gel polish done at the nail salon faithfully until I discovered OPI.  This brand of polish looks great and doesn&#x27;t chip like other nail polish and it last a very long time.  Now, I do my nails at home and save money and the polish looks great and doesn&#x27;t chip as fast.</li>
    <li> Love this color!  Natural looking. I 3-4 coats works best for me.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to get this polish and so glad I did. I love light sheer polish on my nails and this one is so pretty. It arrived quickly, well packaged. Would order from seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many nude pink polishes (high end and low end) and this is the only one that was easy to apply without streaking.  Looks even more beautiful after a top coat.  Lovely color and no streaks.  It is worth paying the price and ditch all the other similar colors.  Save your money on the other sand buy this one instead.  4 stars because it is pricey :)</li>
    <li> hate using dark colors on nails they tend to discolor nails a friend of mine had this one really liked it so bought for myself and daughter</li>
    <li> I am hooked, I love this color and it is the only color I use now.I will never be without this color again.</li>
    <li> I have to put on 3 or 4 layers to see the color.</li>
    <li> Sheer color but pretty</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like about OPI Nail Polish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, good coverage and long lasting.  You Callin&#x27; Me a Lyre is great as a stand alone polish or for an American Manicure.</li>
