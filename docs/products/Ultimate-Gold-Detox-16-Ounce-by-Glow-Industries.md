      <li>PLEASE SAVE YOU MONEY OR SPEND IT ON SOMETHING WITH BETTER QUALITY.</li>
      <li>After 45 minutes you will be clean for 4-5 hours!</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly,  had been clean for 5 more days then the bottle suggests.</li>
      <li>(i.e. don&#x27;t take in any &amp;#34;toxins&amp;#34; for AT LEAST 2 days before you use this for best chances of success).</li>
      <li>but I would never trust anything like this without testing myself at home first!</li>
      <li>I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE, BUT MY BROTHER SAID THAT HE LIKED HOW IT WORKED OUT FOR HIM.</li>
      <li>Drink lots of water with it and use it at the right time for when you need it.</li>

<li> didn&#x27;t work for me, complete waste of the money I paid in shipping alone.</li>
<li> Follow these instructions carefully.</li>
<li> and she said it came back undetermined (not positive, nor negative) and that they had to send it off to a lab.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> First off i bought this crap out of a smoke shop for 30 bucks.</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t as watery as everyone says this was thicker than water to say the least.</li>
<li> What a waste of money don&#x27;t even bother purchasing this product!!!!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t listen to the people who tell you these things will fail you on a test.</li>
<li> and i will fail the test.</li>
<li> And I still failed.</li>
<li> After choking down this nasty stuff it did not work for probation.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After choking down this nasty stuff it did not work for probation. It did work one time for probation. I think it depends on the sensitivity of the test.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t buy this.. but was considering it. It looks like a knock off. The real bottle is thick and doesn&#x27;t have a wattery taste like most say it does. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Go to a local smoke shop.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, as long as you follow the instructions on the bottle, and the place I bought this drink from told me I needed to drink a protein shake and take a multivitamin before consuming this beverage to mask the cleaning agent at the lab. I hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Just make sure you don&#x27;t drink very much water the day off the test or it might show up deluted..and pee twice in the first hour and before your test hold it as long as you can, then when peeing in the cup fill it up mid stream</li>
    <li> First off i bought this crap out of a smoke shop for 30 bucks. i did as instructed, took the test for a pre-employeement(20$$ an hour job). called back for results and she said it came back undetermined (not positive, nor negative) and that they had to send it off to a lab. suspicious she asked me did i drink anything before the test, i lied and said no. i am 100 percent sure that when she sends it to the lab they will put it under a microscope and i will fail the test. PLEASE SAVE YOU MONEY OR SPEND IT ON SOMETHING WITH BETTER QUALITY.</li>
    <li> I USED THIS. IT DIDNT WORK LIKE IT SAID IT WOULD. UNSATISFIED, WORKS WHEN IT WANTS, I ORDERED 2 OF THEM, ONE CAME UP NEG, THE OTHER INVALID</li>
    <li> Did NOT work, even for a self-bought, take-home test, so I do NOT recommend this to anyone. There are better products out there, people...!</li>
    <li> This stuff totally works, not even kidding. Don&#x27;t listen to the people who tell you these things will fail you on a test. I guess everyone is different but the wife got some and it worked for her just drink lots of water with it and stay well hydrated for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me, complete waste of the money I paid in shipping alone. I will not be recommending this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Worked for me. Just follow the online directions and your good to go.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work took 1 out of 2 so far. Took it as directed, stayed away from toxin 3 days prior. The taste was okay and it felt very acidic going down, almost gave me heart burn. Wasn&#x27;t as watery as everyone says this was thicker than water to say the least. Tested about 10 times over 3 hours all came up positive! Also make sure to buy at home test strips when ordering any detox drink! Its better to know before you go!  Just t clarify I was a consistent smoker (2-5+ times a day) for the last month and an occasional smoker (1-8 times a month) prior to that for the last 2 years. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&#x27; and weigh 185 lbs with minimal daily activity as I used to work a desk job. I had not smoked in 6 days prior to trying this drink, but it had worked in the past and I was probably close to clean then. I also do not drink much for fluids, but when I do its water, tea or sweet tea 16oz+ a day and my diet isn&#x27;t always the healthiest but I&#x27;ve stopped eating fast food everyday and I have 2-3 meals a day.  I used the following instructions when trying this.  1. Follow these instructions carefully. 2. Drink only one 16oz glass of water one hour before drinking Ultimate Gold. 3. Shake Well. 4. Drink entire contents of bottle in a timely manner (quickly). 5. 15 minutes after drinking Ultimate Gold refill bottle and drink. 6. Urinate 2-3 times in the first hour. 7. After 45 minutes you will be clean for 4-5 hours! Enhancing Ultimate Gold Effectiveness The followig will help Ultimate Gold be as effective as possible to energize the detoxification process.  I recommend ordering from http://www.quickfixurine.com/ a bottle of synthetic urine as a fail safe. Just make sure to wear a baggy shirt/clothing so you can stuff into underwear, bra or pants to where the bottle will not bulge through as long as they do not frisk you or monitor you when you pee.  I will be trying the second bottle when I actually have an interview for a job as I just moved to another state and wanted to see if it would work. I&#x27;malso abstaining from using until I find new employment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times, and it works IF you follow instructions carefully (i.e. don&#x27;t take in any &amp;#34;toxins&amp;#34; for AT LEAST 2 days before you use this for best chances of success). Drink lots of water with it and use it at the right time for when you need it. Remember that it isn&#x27;t actually meant to fully &amp;#34;clean out&amp;#34; your system (that takes time), but if you use this right you have a brief window of opportunity for when you&#x27;re interviewing for a job, etc. So time how you use this with that in mind. Hope this advice helps!</li>
    <li> Drank a jug of cranberry juice the night before. Used this in the morning and it worked.</li>
    <li> This product works, just make sure you don&#x27;t have any toxins in your body few days prior and you&#x27;ll be good. Also no fatty foods the night before and u cannot eat anything while taking it. Also drink lots of water.</li>
    <li> I tool a drug test using this drink followed the instructions and guess what it came back POSITIVE!!!! What a waste of money don&#x27;t even bother purchasing this product!!!!</li>
    <li> It did work for me but I would never trust anything like this without testing myself at home first! It costs about $25 for the detox and another $18 for the urine test but its totally worth it to be able to know your results BEFORE the people that matter do!! GOOD LUCK and TEST YOURSELF FIRST...FO SHO!</li>
    <li> Need to package it up right otherwise they leak , every time we get them I&#x27;ll have one or two bottles leaked</li>
    <li> I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE, BUT MY BROTHER SAID THAT HE LIKED HOW IT WORKED OUT FOR HIM.</li>
    <li> It doesnt work, what. So. Ever. I followed the instructions exactly,  had been clean for 5 more days then the bottle suggests. And I still failed. Id give it 0 stars if possible.</li>
    <li> I purchased it twice for a friend... Said he would never use it again...was dissatisfied both times.</li>
    <li> They changed the bottle and the formula! Now it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this drink before and it worked great. However, the last time I ordered it from Amazon the bottle was a different shape, there was no label on the new bottle, the drink itself is now not as thick as it used to be and it tastes watered down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this one.</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
