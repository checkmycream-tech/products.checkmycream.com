### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They work great!  </li>
      <li>Very good items.</li>
      <li>I am happy I looked online for this product.</li>
      <li>Great product and cheaper than in store</li>
      <li>These are a great deal.</li>
      <li>The remover/soak off wasn&#x27;t very effective at all.  </li>
      <li>This is a good size for these items.</li>
      <li>I love that it comes with a nail file too!  </li>
      <li>which, let&#x27;s be honest, no one is buying this for the file</li>
      <li>I love Gelish products and love this set!  </li>
      <li>Great exactly what I ordered Thank you</li>
      <li>(I was pretty experienced with gel removal,</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>WAY before it was supposed to! :)</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more.  </li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;d love to tell you that I was able to use the product.  </li>
      <li>Fast and easy fragrance is great,  gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>It may cost more, but worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to give you a full review of how fantastic these fancy labeled bottles of acetone really work.  </li>
      <li>I love this product it is actually, what it is suppose to be good reasonable price, came in a timely manor.</li>
      <li>Soak off remover is not as good as the generic acetone from drug store.</li>
      <li>The cost was great for the same product I can buy at Sally&#x27;s for a lot more money for a smaller quantity.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll have it right away</li>
      <li>Took a half hour of soaking, and I still had a good bit to file and lift off.  </li>
      <li>when i first started doing my gel nail, it came with the set.  </li>
      <li>any rate, I opened the box to find that the product had literally evaporated (which would actually be pretty funny if I hadn&#x27;t just paid for it and waited for it to ship).&lt;br</li>
      <li>The size is perfect - I think the remover will be gone long before the cleanser, so I will probably just buy that next time, but this is definitely the way to go if you need both.</li>
      <li>Great price for these products, slight leakage but nothing major when I first received the package.</li>
      <li>This is good stuff, especially the nail remover, I will be ordering the larger container.  </li>
      <li>(maybe the real reason</li>
      <li>really love this product, would like to see the bottles a little bigger but over all the price and quality is amazing and this is the only place i can find the both the cleaner and remover in a combo.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Suck the bottles came leaking more than half the Was gone and when I used it doesn&#x27;t even work the only thing that works is the file</li>
      <li>It was not sealed and the bottle was almost half empty, although it was packaged nicely, it still had leaked in the box.</li>
      <li>It is much larger then what comes in the starter kits, but not too large.  </li>
      <li>but I would recommend for professional use also.</li>
      <li>this product, wow</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a little bummed the bottles didn&#x27;t arrive full-</li>
      <li>Update on previous review;) they re-sent the remover!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You can use store bought acetone to soak off your gel, and use acetone to wipe the stickiness off when done also. Cheaper!!! These items are a rip off. FYI. Read the ingredients on these products. One product is rubbing alcohol and the other is acetone.</li>
    <li> really love this product, would like to see the bottles a little bigger but over all the price and quality is amazing and this is the only place i can find the both the cleaner and remover in a combo.</li>
    <li> I love this product it is actually, what it is suppose to be good reasonable price, came in a timely manor. I will be purchasing more.  I love it</li>
    <li> This product works the way it is suppose to.  Fast and easy fragrance is great,  gentle on the skin. Color are inviting.</li>
    <li> The remover/soak off wasn&#x27;t very effective at all.  I had read reviews of similar statements, but got this anyway thinking it was user error. (I was pretty experienced with gel removal, so didn&#x27;t figure I&#x27;d have the same issues.)  Took a half hour of soaking, and I still had a good bit to file and lift off.  I did that once and threw the rest of the product out.</li>
    <li> I love Gelish products and love this set!  It is much larger then what comes in the starter kits, but not too large.  I love that it comes with a nail file too!  Arrived quickly…WAY before it was supposed to! :)</li>
    <li> One of the bottles arrived partially open and had leaked into the bag.  There was no nail file as pictures.  I&#x27;m a little bummed the bottles didn&#x27;t arrive full- I was planning on giving this as a gift.</li>
    <li> The package contained only one of the items listed. The Artificial Nail Remover. It was not sealed and the bottle was almost half empty, although it was packaged nicely, it still had leaked in the box.</li>
    <li> They work great!  No problems to present.  I use it for home manicures for myself and my family but I would recommend for professional use also.</li>
    <li> Update on previous review;) they re-sent the remover! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;d love to tell you that I was able to use the product.  I&#x27;d love to give you a full review of how fantastic these fancy labeled bottles of acetone really work.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t... some issue between the bottle design and packaging rendered this product completely useless.  It spilled all over the box (and the other product I had ordered).  It ruined the &amp;#34;bonus file,&amp;#34; which, let&#x27;s be honest, no one is buying this for the file (maybe the real reason it&#x27;s in there is so that it can act as a sponge and soak up the product when it spills).&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I opened the box to find that the product had literally evaporated (which would actually be pretty funny if I hadn&#x27;t just paid for it and waited for it to ship).&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, go to Sally.  You&#x27;ll have it right away and you won&#x27;t risk paying for something that you don&#x27;t receive.</li>
    <li> Very good items. I have already ordered the second stock.</li>
    <li> This is a good size for these items. The cost was great for the same product I can buy at Sally&#x27;s for a lot more money for a smaller quantity.</li>
    <li> defective, perforated bottle spilled liquid</li>
    <li> Cleanser works well. Soak off remover is not as good as the generic acetone from drug store.</li>
    <li> Great product and cheaper than in store</li>
    <li> Great price for these products, slight leakage but nothing major when I first received the package. I am happy I looked online for this product.</li>

    <li> This is good stuff, especially the nail remover, I will be ordering the larger container.  I use this when i first started doing my gel nail, it came with the set.  Then I heard you can use 100 % acetone, it&#x27;s cheaper.  I found it very hard to remove my gel products with acetone, it was taking way too long.  I went back to  this product, wow what a difference, (acetone 1/2 - 1 hour, Gelish Remover 10 - 15 minutes).  It may cost more, but worth the money.  Will continue to purchase this item.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> They where not full when I got them</li>
