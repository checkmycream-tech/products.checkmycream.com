      <li>Ardell is a wonderful brand and this product will last me a very long time for the most natural look possible I brush some of the powder off onto my palm and mix this in with my clear mascara which i use to brush my brows in place, i get compliments on my eyebrows multiple times a day.</li>

      <li>really well with my brow.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>The formula is smoother and less &#x27;powdery&#x27; so application is very easy and controlled.  </li>
      <li>Its so hard to find black eyebrow powder, so I was very happy when I found this.  </li>
      <li>I recently purchased a high end eyebrow powder at a local boutique for more than three times the purchase price of this item.</li>
      <li>This product is so much better--on another scale completely.</li>
      <li>Normally Sallys Beauty Supply carries it, but they were out.</li>
      <li>, the application is neat vibrant yet natural.</li>
      <li>Powder blends good and isn&#x27;t too dark for being black powder.</li>
      <li>Makes eyebrows look so natural if you apply whats needed!</li>
      <li>Only use it with the water trick if it&#x27;s not too hot</li>
      <li>Good color, but the brush it comes with is useless.  </li>
      <li>ANd even though the brush is so tiny, I actually like how it applies the product even more that other brushes (for example Mac eyeliner brush).  </li>
      <li>Although smaller in size, this brow powder is half the price, goes on smoothly, and looks natural.  </li>

<li> and it&#x27;s hard for me to find a black eyebrow powder because most powders only have dark brown as their darkest powder.</li>
<li> It was not soft enough for me...</li>
<li> Looks so natural for people with black eyebrows.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a soft black eyebrow powder for months and came across this one on Amazon.  </li>
<li> It looks very natural and you only need a small dab.  </li>
<li> Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s \\&quot;soft black\\&quot; was chalky and started breaking up after a few uses so that I could no longer carry it in my handbag.  </li>
<li> Only thing is I found the brush it comes with pretty useless.</li>
<li> My only complaint is the size of the brush -- tiny!</li>
<li> Nothing crazy special</li>
<li> Other products make the darkening look fake and obvious while this one gives a natural dark look.</li>
<li> This is my only complaint about the product.</li>
<li> Other than that, the powder does the job!</li>
<li> I have sparse almost black eye brows and have used eye brow pencil since forever.  </li>
<li> I have naturally black hair</li>
<li> Finally a black eyebrow powder.</li>
<li> It goes on JET BLACK and looks unnatural.  </li>
<li> the color is just what i&#x27;ve been wanting and it is black but not too black.&lt;br</li>
<li> but I need it for my jet black hair.</li>
<li> I combine it with dark brown powder so it doesn&#x27;t look so harsh.</li>
<li> Also the case is hard to open, and it&#x27;s just a bit too small.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products for my fading thin eyebrows.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had this powder for a few months now and</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a black brow powder on the market, everything else is brown, dark brown...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so hard to find black powder</li>
<li> Too dark!!</li>
<li> The shade is just what I was looking for; however, the brush is too small for me.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s often difficult to find black eyebrow powder to match my black hair.  </li>
<li> Black is too severe and brown is just wrong.  </li>
<li> I wish they made this type of brush in a bigger size :(</li>
<li> They are impossible to deal with - they get dull and sharpening them is a exercise in futility as they keep breaking as you sharpen.  </li>
<li> it is quite difficult to find this eyebrow powder shade in stores.</li>

    <li> Made my brows look filled in naturally.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life.  I have sparse almost black eye brows and have used eye brow pencil since forever.  They are impossible to deal with - they get dull and sharpening them is a exercise in futility as they keep breaking as you sharpen.  This is so much better. Love it.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t too many brow powders suitable for women with black/graying hair.  Black is too severe and brown is just wrong.  If you look at the eyebrow of black-haired women, you&#x27;ll see that the actually color is a charcoal.  I have been using powders from high-end cosmetic companies bought from fancy department stores.  Estee Lauder was my favorite, but it was discontinued.  Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s \\&quot;soft black\\&quot; was chalky and started breaking up after a few uses so that I could no longer carry it in my handbag.  Although smaller in size, this brow powder is half the price, goes on smoothly, and looks natural.  I&#x27;m glad I discovered it.  I&#x27;ll always buy this brand now.</li>
    <li> This one is the best one I have used, especially with a little water added to glide on better. Only use it with the water trick if it&#x27;s not too hot or you don&#x27;t sweat. Otherwise, it will smear. But this is a great product. Have to order more.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a high end eyebrow powder at a local boutique for more than three times the purchase price of this item. This product is so much better--on another scale completely. If you have black hair, this soft black will blend in perfectly with your brows and do a super job filling in sparse spots. The brush makes application a breeze. Also, your eyebrows will not smudge if you get water on them. BeautyOnline shipped the product quickly and thoughtfully protected the item with bubble wrap and sturdy cardboard. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Finally a black eyebrow powder. I have naturally black hair and it&#x27;s hard for me to find a black eyebrow powder because most powders only have dark brown as their darkest powder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a soft black eyebrow powder for months and came across this one on Amazon.  The price was much better then the department stores cosmetics.  I am Asian American and it&#x27;s often difficult to find black eyebrow powder to match my black hair.  What I like about this powder is that it&#x27;s not dusty and flaky like others I&#x27;ve used.  The formula is smoother and less &#x27;powdery&#x27; so application is very easy and controlled.  I use a separate eyebrow brush with a longer handle, not what came in the kit.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found this eyebrow powder and am thinking of getting a second one.  It will last me for YEARS!</li>
    <li> the color is just what i&#x27;ve been wanting and it is black but not too black.&lt;br /&gt;works really well with my brow. thanks</li>
    <li> Love this powder! It&#x27;s so hard to find black powder but I need it for my jet black hair. I combine it with dark brown powder so it doesn&#x27;t look so harsh. I really like it&#x27;s staying power too.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, very natural look.You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Ardell is a wonderful brand and this product will last me a very long time for the most natural look possible I brush some of the powder off onto my palm and mix this in with my clear mascara which i use to brush my brows in place, i get compliments on my eyebrows multiple times a day.</li>
    <li> Very happy with item.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes EVERYWHERE!!  It goes on JET BLACK and looks unnatural.  I have to wash my face after applying it!!</li>
    <li> this is the only brow shadow I use.Normally Sallys Beauty Supply carries it, but they were out. This stuff will last a year for me, can&#x27;t beat the wear or price</li>
    <li> I have gotten so many compliments after using this product!!! I never used anything like this before and its really user friendly.</li>
    <li> Good color, but the brush it comes with is useless.  Buy with eyebrow wax!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a black brow powder on the market, everything else is brown, dark brown...The powder works great and last longer than some of the brow pencils.
