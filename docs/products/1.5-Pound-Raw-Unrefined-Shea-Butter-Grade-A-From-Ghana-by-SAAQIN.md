      <li>4.5 HONEST REVIEW:</li>
      <li>I put it on my hair, it feels sticky but nice.</li>
      <li>Feels nice on my skin.</li>
      <li>I put it in my own container.</li>
      <li>It does a nice job of moisturizing and is non-comedogenic.  </li>
      <li>Got this to make several things, including deodorant, worked great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like I have watered my skin, my skin has been thirsty and it is now satisfied..</li>
      <li>My skin has never been more radiant and supple.</li>
      <li>Love and Light!</li>
      <li>So make sure you have a container to</li>
      <li>very excited to start using it.</li>
      <li>Not in some special container or like the bowl that&#x27;s in the picture--a bag.</li>
      <li>Was packaged well and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update this later after I&#x27;ve used the butter and can more accurately tell you how it works for my skin.</li>
      <li>It was sealed and fresh.</li>
      <li>It has a natural smokey nutty aroma, which I personally love.</li>
      <li>How could anyone in their right mind complain about that for the price???</li>
      <li>feels right</li>
      <li>It was a good buy, shipping was reasonable, and it works very well on my dry hands.</li>
      <li>I am a first time shea butter user</li>
      <li>The product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I will order this again,IF I ever run out.&lt;br /&gt;;-)</li>
      <li>I am telling you, I have used and boughtten and spent ridiculous amounts of money on moisturizers and I have never in my existence experienced something so absolutely nourishing for my skin, my skin feels like silk!!!</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing!I use this product in my hair after I wash it and it leaves my hair very soft and shiny!Will be ordering again!</li>
      <li>Not a good container, but good produce for the money,</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even really fully put it into words how absolutely amazing on my entire body from hair, face, down to my toes</li>
      <li>To get out the remaining shea butter left in the bag I microwaved it and the melted shea butter came right out</li>
      <li>It helped some pretty ugly red scrapes,heal perfectly.</li>
      <li>I am in LOVE with my raw shea Butter Grade A.</li>
      <li>The only thing to be aware of is it does not come in a container as it would if you were to buy it in store.</li>
      <li>and now my whole family like it specially for the dry weather of the winter it helps with dry skin, eczema,  scars, etc</li>
      <li>I just want to say, on behalf of the negative comments regarding this raw shea and this seller, to any skeptics out there, look at the ratio of POSITIVE feedback versus the negative feedbacks and you will see their positive feedback greatly outweighs any negatives!!</li>
      <li>please don&#x27;t ever stop selling this NATURAL BEAUTY!&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
      <li>It came all the way from Africa, underwent FDA testing for contaminates, bagged, and shipped straight to my door for only 9 DOLLARS!!</li>
      <li>I used some oils tho for re-fragrancing because the shea butter... not the best (not the worst either) scent-wise, but cannot really complain, highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I like the thought of using an all natural product.</li>
      <li>I put some directly on my eczema</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a long lasting and useful product, this is the one.</li>
      <li>It smells like NATURAL BEAUTY, and feels like no other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin before.</li>
      <li>Looks nothing like the block in the picture (has more of a choppy deep mustard yellow with beige patches all over).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lasting quite a long time.(so I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying a new one anytime soon)</li>
      <li>Great product-I used it as a main ingredient in homemade butt cream for my 10 month old girl who tends to get nasty rashes.</li>
      <li>for a pound and a half, and some of the customers wants to complain it only comes in a plastic bag???</li>
      <li>This raw shea butter is coming ALL THE WAY FROM GHANA AFRICA.. and for under 10 dollars I got 1.5 LBS of this NATURAL BEAUTY!!!!</li>

<li> Works great, even though it smells bad, but that&#x27;s how raw Shea butter naturally smells.</li>
<li> I do believe it is pure raw Shea butter.</li>
<li> Arrived earlier than I expected.  </li>
<li> Came a day earlier than expected.</li>
<li> It was not in a block like the picture but broken up and sticking to the plastic that suppose to keep it sealed and fresh.</li>
<li> I have really dry skin</li>

<li> One and a half pounds of shea butter should last a long time.</li>
<li> Plus it was not sealed in a bag that said &amp;#34;Organic Unrefined Shea Butter&amp;#34; but had holes in the bag like it been through a rough ride.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet to make lotions and other things</li>
<li> It has little pieces of nut in it (which I can overlook) as is the smell, I add a little scented oil to it when I rub it on my skin.</li>
<li> The product looks raw unrefined and that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
<li> It came in a rectangular block and another small triangular piece like it had been cut off another block to make it 1.5 lbs.</li>
<li> and I mean what else is there to say..</li>
<li> Completely ridiculous, and</li>
<li> I fully intend to buy this raw shea FOR LIFE and with the price and QUALITY of the raw shea I received, this seller will be my number one!!!</li>
<li> Seriously people!!</li>

    <li> It was a good buy, shipping was reasonable, and it works very well on my dry hands. One and a half pounds of shea butter should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product-I used it as a main ingredient in homemade butt cream for my 10 month old girl who tends to get nasty rashes. Works great, even though it smells bad, but that&#x27;s how raw Shea butter naturally smells. Was packaged well and arrived quickly. I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> I put some directly on my eczema and it&#x27;s working well. I put it on my hair, it feels sticky but nice. The product looks raw unrefined and that&#x27;s what I wanted. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin and this product works on my hair, feet and body. It has little pieces of nut in it (which I can overlook) as is the smell, I add a little scented oil to it when I rub it on my skin. If you are looking for a long lasting and useful product, this is the one. Shipping was great too!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know way look like it did in the picture. Plus it was not sealed in a bag that said &amp;#34;Organic Unrefined Shea Butter&amp;#34; but had holes in the bag like it been through a rough ride. It was not in a block like the picture but broken up and sticking to the plastic that suppose to keep it sealed and fresh. I will never order from that person again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet to make lotions and other things but it came in the mail, its yellow and sealed in a plastic bag. very excited to start using it.</li>
    <li> VERY VERY nice shea butter! Wonderful price,for so much. It helped some pretty ugly red scrapes,heal perfectly.I will order this again,IF I ever run out.&lt;br /&gt;;-)</li>
    <li> Wonderful shea butter. Omg this amount of shea butter will last me years. What an awesome deal, I love it. It came in a plastic bag. I put it in my own container. To get out the remaining shea butter left in the bag I microwaved it and the melted shea butter came right out</li>
    <li> This ish came in a bag. Not in some special container or like the bowl that&#x27;s in the picture--a bag. And it&#x27;s yellow and grainy, not smooth and creamy and white. Completely ridiculous, and I don&#x27;t know who gave this product all those damn fives--maybe the people who pulled this raggedy-ass shea butter from the tree.</li>
    <li> 4.5 HONEST REVIEW: Came a day earlier than expected. It weighed 1.6lbs on my scale. It was sealed and fresh. I do believe it is pure raw Shea butter. Feels nice on my skin. It came in a rectangular block and another small triangular piece like it had been cut off another block to make it 1.5 lbs. Looks nothing like the block in the picture (has more of a choppy deep mustard yellow with beige patches all over). I&#x27;ll update this later after I&#x27;ve used the butter and can more accurately tell you how it works for my skin.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s lasting quite a long time.(so I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying a new one anytime soon) The only thing to be aware of is it does not come in a container as it would if you were to buy it in store. So make sure you have a container to but it in. Besides that it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than I expected.  It was packaged well and I mean what else is there to say..its shea butter and I use it on my hair and skin and I love the smell!</li>
    <li> I have being using it for a while and now my whole family like it specially for the dry weather of the winter it helps with dry skin, eczema,  scars, etc</li>
