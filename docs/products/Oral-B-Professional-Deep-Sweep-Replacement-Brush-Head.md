      <li>and I feel that I do a better job.  </li>
      <li>We tried this brush and love it.</li>
      <li>but it seems to do the job), and chose this brush head because it had the most &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; brush shape-</li>
      <li>In either case, it was easy to tell which head belonged to whom in our household.  </li>
      <li>My hygienist complimented me on my clean healthy teeth and gums since using this and water pic.  </li>
      <li>I think Floss-Action still does a great job and will most likely stick with that.</li>
      <li>These good replacement brushes at a decent price.</li>
      <li>They work just fine with my oral 5000.</li>
      <li>That will cover my needs for the next six months, at a great price.</li>
      <li>one check up so far and good results.</li>
      <li>There are many brush styles from which to choose from intense cleaning to flossing and more.</li>
      <li>I feel clean, but not anymore than the Floss-Action head.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>and they do make for a clean feeling mouth.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feels so clean after every brushing.</li>
      <li>these are nice and soft and massage the gums.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that it is so much cheaper than the Sonicare.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes, they really make my teeth feel clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>my teeth feel fresh and clean, but without any mild toothache.</li>
      <li>It feels a lot like a normal toothbrush, but better.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend these brushes to anyone who wants a clean &amp; germ free mouth</li>
      <li>After seeing the NEW Deep Sweep Brush heads on TV, I thought it was a great idea/item.</li>
      <li>If I want a deeper clean I can set the toothbrush to &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; mode and do it that way, but for day to day these are my first choice.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t think its worth ~$8 for this brush head.</li>
      <li>With the different bristles we feel our teeth are getting a better clean.</li>
      <li>But for right now I am well stocked .</li>
      <li>This new brush style seems to be superior to any we have tried before and they seem to last longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
      <li>I prefer these to the Precision Clean head that both comes with most of Oral-B&#x27;s toothbrushes and are more commonly found for sale.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t doubt that the Precision Clean gives you a deeper clean, but for people with sensitive teeth they can sometimes leave you with some very mild toothache particularly if you use them with the &amp;#34;Daily Clean&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; cleaning modes (as opposed to the sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>teeth seem to be really clean after using these new brushes</li>
      <li>They are exactly what comes with the Oral-B 4000.  </li>
      <li>really like this powerful toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I decided to buy more brushes of the same type, all I think I could find locally was a 3 pack of replacement heads for most of what Amazon was asking for a 4 pack.</li>
      <li>This is a first for me.ha ha</li>
      <li>Only thing that could be better is the price.  </li>
      <li>Amazon was one of the few places with a 4 pack at a good price.</li>
      <li>I started with the floss action heads which made my mouth feel clean, but also made my gums hurt.  </li>
      <li>It helps you to brush effectively with little to no effort.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast</li>
      <li>I find that these brushes reach between my teeth and get them much cleaner.</li>
      <li>Cleans very well.</li>
      <li>After reading the earlier reviews, I was unsure if these replacements with fit.</li>
      <li>but this brush design makes it much easier</li>
      <li>I tried the whitening brush heads, but I didnt really like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Why these brushes cost so much is beyond my understanding.</li>
      <li>plan to order in the future fast serves and will help keep my gums and teeth clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few Oral-B brush heads over the years and this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I first started using the Oral B Professional Brush at the near insistence of my dental hygienist, (still getting used to the brush</li>
      <li>so I automatically get sent new ones every three months.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel like I had a professional cleaning every day.</li>
      <li>brush bristle is really soft... too soft for me.</li>
      <li>but I have sensitive gums so it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering again in the near future.</li>
      <li>I used to have to be pretty careful to reach my back molars</li>
      <li>It really brushes up and down.</li>

<li> Its like going to the hygenist everyday.</li>

<li> No more folks...</li>
<li> In the past (and we&#x27;ve been with Oral-B for years)</li>
<li> Now, we have to use the position of the brush heads in the storage rack on the charger base to determine whose is whose.  </li>

    <li> My hygienist complimented me on my clean healthy teeth and gums since using this and water pic.  My teeth feel like I had a professional cleaning every day.</li>
    <li> These are great replacement brushes.  They are exactly what comes with the Oral-B 4000.  I feel the price was also fair.</li>
    <li> That will cover my needs for the next six months, at a great price. I will reorder again when needed.</li>
    <li> No color rings to help me know whose is who&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> See my toothbrush review.....Oral-B 5000......There are many brush styles from which to choose from intense cleaning to flossing and more.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the new Oral-B toothbrush and its brush heads.  I find that these brushes reach between my teeth and get them much cleaner.</li>
    <li> Great price. Cleans very well. Its like going to the hygenist everyday. I had to cut back a little on the brushing with it. My hygenist said I was too vigorous. This is a first for me.ha ha</li>
    <li> Why these brushes cost so much is beyond my understanding. These good replacement brushes at a decent price. My loves the movement on this style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few Oral-B brush heads over the years and this one is my favorite.  I like the larger brush head.  I especially like how the tip pivots.  I used to have to be pretty careful to reach my back molars but this brush design makes it much easier and I feel that I do a better job.  I&#x27;ve got them coming on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save so I automatically get sent new ones every three months.</li>
    <li> Best price for these great brushes, had to have extras so I wouldn&#x27;t be without any for even one day!</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes .best electric tooth brush ever used! plan to order in the future fast serves and will help keep my gums and teeth clean.</li>
    <li> had to stop using toothbrush heads because they kept poking my gums. it worked well for a while but I have sensitive gums so it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the deep sweep system from costco But they didn&#x27;t have the replacement brush heads so i order these at a good price</li>
    <li> This attaches easily and works and wears as good as the original brush that came with the toothbrush.  Shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I prefer these to the Precision Clean head that both comes with most of Oral-B&#x27;s toothbrushes and are more commonly found for sale. I don&#x27;t doubt that the Precision Clean gives you a deeper clean, but for people with sensitive teeth they can sometimes leave you with some very mild toothache particularly if you use them with the &amp;#34;Daily Clean&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; cleaning modes (as opposed to the sensitive teeth mode).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these Deep Sweep heads, even on &amp;#34;Daily Clean&amp;#34; mode my teeth feel fresh and clean, but without any mild toothache. If I want a deeper clean I can set the toothbrush to &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; mode and do it that way, but for day to day these are my first choice.</li>
    <li> The brushes do an excellent job. I wish Oral-B would have built in a timer on the handle, this of course is no reflection on the brushes.</li>
    <li> Good brushes..gentle on my teeth.Like the feel of my clean teeth!! I would recommend these brushes to anyone who wants a clean &amp; germ free mouth</li>
    <li> Performs well, without hurting your gums.</li>
    <li> What inventory genius decided that all four heads in this multipack should be the same color?  In the past (and we&#x27;ve been with Oral-B for years) each head in a multipack either came packaged with a number of different colored snap-on  rings or, came with a different colored ring already on each of the heads. In either case, it was easy to tell which head belonged to whom in our household.  No more folks...each of the brushes in this multipack has a white ring!  Now, we have to use the position of the brush heads in the storage rack on the charger base to determine whose is whose.  Dumb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, these brushes do work well and they do make for a clean feeling mouth.  But the deal killer for me with these heads is noted above.  We will cancel our next order for these and go back to one of the other heads.</li>
    <li> Great price for replacement heads</li>
    <li> Bought these for my toothbrush and they work fine and are a fair price. Made by Oral-b, NOT generic, always a plus.</li>
    <li> we used to use the floss heads which i liked but they we&#x27;re a little.. how to put it.. stiff? these are nice and soft and massage the gums. i also like that they reach way back and get the back teeth. i can highly recommend these little guys... not really a better price than in the store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrush for years now along with their Floss-Action Head. I like it and it definitely works... according to my dentist. After seeing the NEW Deep Sweep Brush heads on TV, I thought it was a great idea/item. Soon thereafter, I Amazon-ed it and just received the brushes today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this the next \\&quot;big\\&quot; thing in brushing?? Probably not. I feel clean, but not anymore than the Floss-Action head.&lt;br /&gt;The brush bristle is really soft... too soft for me. I guess it shouldn&#x27;t be stiff, but this is definitely softer than the Floss-Action Head.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think its worth ~$8 for this brush head. I think Floss-Action still does a great job and will most likely stick with that.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they really make my teeth feel clean and fresh. I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I first started using the Oral B Professional Brush at the near insistence of my dental hygienist, (still getting used to the brush but it seems to do the job), and chose this brush head because it had the most &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; brush shape- one check up so far and good results. I decided to buy more brushes of the same type, all I think I could find locally was a 3 pack of replacement heads for most of what Amazon was asking for a 4 pack. Time will tell but I think these brushes do the job.</li>
    <li> This new brush style seems to be superior to any we have tried before and they seem to last longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;my teeth seem to be really clean after using these new brushes</li>
    <li> I subscribed to this so I could get my refills for a few dollars less than going to the store to purchase them.</li>
    <li> My teeth feels so clean after every brushing. It really brushes up and down. Great innovation and technology. Great product.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet. It looks like it is everything I ever wanted in a tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this powerful toothbrush.</li>
    <li> After reading the earlier reviews, I was unsure if these replacements with fit. They work just fine with my oral 5000.</li>
    <li> On time and great product. Will be ordering again in the near future. But for right now I am well stocked .</li>
    <li> Only thing that could be better is the price.  Amazon was one of the few places with a 4 pack at a good price.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It helps you to brush effectively with little to no effort.</li>
    <li> I have had an oral b toothbrush for about a year.  I started with the floss action heads which made my mouth feel clean, but also made my gums hurt.  I tried the whitening brush heads, but I didnt really like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brush heads are so awesome.  I LOVE my toothbrush now.  It feels a lot like a normal toothbrush, but better.  I used to have a sonicare toothbrush- these heads are comparable from a brushing experience, but way better.</li>
    <li> We used to be Sonicare people but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price when ours died. We tried this brush and love it. With the different bristles we feel our teeth are getting a better clean. Love the fact that it is so much cheaper than the Sonicare.</li>
