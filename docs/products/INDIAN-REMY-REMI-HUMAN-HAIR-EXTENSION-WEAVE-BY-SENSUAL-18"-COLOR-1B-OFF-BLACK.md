<li> It&#x27;s ok hair, not great hair.</li>

<li> There was hardly any hair in the packet</li>
<li> My beautician told me the hair I brought is no good.</li>
<li> the biggest disappointment is not longer than pedi, the amount of hair is little outright fraud not recommend this purchase .</li>
<li> For that price I was skeptical</li>
<li> or it will start to look bad.</li>
<li> However you must seal the weft before installing it because it sheds really badly.</li>
<li> This was probably the worst hair i have ever bought, it is</li>
<li> the ends of hair are horrible (you will have to cut about 2in off )</li>

    <li> I bought 3 bundles. Thinking that would be enough. It would have been if the hair was 100g as the description says bundles are 50-75g one of my bundles was half the size of the other (2) 25-30g.  hair leaked a lot of black hair dye from being processed. ( you won&#x27;t be able to dye with out bleaching hair 1000000x ) package came from &amp;#34;Dave carpenter&amp;#34; hair has ALOT of breakage the ends of hair are horrible (you will have to cut about 2in off ) not like there&#x27;s any hair on the ends anyway cheap hair with even cheaper quality Dont let the people fool you this hair is not worth 1$</li>
    <li> Idk what these ppl talking about but this is great hair!!!!!! For that price I was skeptical but I&#x27;m so happy I ignored the bad reviews it even looks longer than 18&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s what I ordered two bundles. The packaging was ok not as shown at the picture though the hair smelled a little funny but after I washed it was perfect !! And it came in so fast! Like two weeks they told me it was gonna take over a month I was so happy when I recieved them yesterday! I will be buying more!</li>

    <li> Very thin, not long enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair in for about 3 weeks. It&#x27;s ok hair, not great hair. It feels and looks good. However you must seal the weft before installing it because it sheds really badly. I also recommend co washing it before install and regularly, maybe every 10 days. Use heat protection if you put heat on it and wear a scarf while sleeping or it will start to look bad. Its good hair but you can&#x27;t just put it in and not take care of it, it needs work.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t enough hair that came in the package. Even after I purchased two packs.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet expectations it look no thing like the  product  ,I have seen ,I expect it better</li>
    <li> My beautician told me the hair I brought is no good. I brought this hair and some cheap hair from the beauty supply. The cheap hair laid down and stay in place. The Indian Remy Remi so-called-human hair would not laid down at all. I will never order hair online. I have to be in the store to see the hair for myself.</li>
    <li> Is not what i expected, very much disappointe.There was hardly any hair in the packet an it seem as if someone cut out some of the hair.</li>
    <li> This was probably the worst hair i have ever bought, it is N O T H I N G close to remy, i thought i could save a little money and buy this hair but that was a huge mistake the hair sheds like crazy and is very thin i bought to packs of the 18 inch an it was barley enough and to top it of it had strains of thread it in that i had to pull out..... but the hair curled wonderfully... basically is you need a quick weave this is the hair to buy.... also i bought  2 packs of 1b but i was only sent one pack of 1b and a pack of 2b i was very upset</li>
    <li> The texture is the best I have ever bought.  It was very smooth and no tangles to deal with like other brands I have used</li>
    <li> Totally different from advertising , plus I ordered in black and color have come come in red , put a star because it was necessary to comment.</li>
    <li> It is good hair. You can curl it, flat iron it but can not dye it. It says human hair but it is some kind of blend. It held up really nicely...but dont be fooled it is def not 100% human!</li>
    <li> The only Issues I had with the weave after I got it, is the package they had it in, because It does not match the picture i saw on Amazon and; the way they folded the hair to mail it. It made the hair crinkly; i had to straighten it out.  Although, I have not yet used the weave it feels like good hair and hopefully it is.</li>
    <li> i didnt want clip ins. the hair was not enough. 25. dollars waisted. i will not recamend to any one</li>
    <li> EL PRODUCTO ES EXCELENTE NO HAY NADA QUE SE LE COMPARE, ME GUSTARÍA QUE TENGAN MAS VARIEDAD EN PULGADAS, PARA PODER AJUSTARSE AL PRESUPUESTO DE CADA BOLSILLO. HE VENIDO USANDO EXTENSIONES HACE MUCHO TIEMPO Y NO HE ENCONTRADO NADA COMO ESTO Y A ESTE PRECIO ES SIMPLEMENTE EXCELENTE. SIN PALABRAS DEBO AGRADECERLES POR EXISTIR.</li>
    <li> Its really good hair and the color is on point.</li>
    <li> The request in black and brown sent, plus I found too short, I think the long-publishing is not the one who sent me.</li>
    <li> I was very dissatisfied. I weaved my hair with two packs of this product on August 17,2012 and I&#x27;ve already lost half the volume cause the weave sheds alot and the colour from it messes up everything I wear. Very upset.</li>
    <li> It has shine but its a small bundle.</li>
