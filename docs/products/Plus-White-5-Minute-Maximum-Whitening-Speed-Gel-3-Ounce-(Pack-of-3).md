      <li>I&#x27;ve kept this gel on my teeth for more than 5 minutes as well and after</li>
      <li>My store isn&#x27;t carrying it any more.</li>
      <li>However, make sure not to get any of the gel on your gums, as in can sting and get reddish after use.</li>
      <li>I use a whitening toothpaste, this product helps brighten my teeth even more.  </li>
      <li>Better price than most.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I have denser, more stubborn teeth than they...    </li>
      <li>I purchased this 3 Pack to brighten my teeth a touch more and the rest for maintenance.</li>
      <li>AT THE TOP OF THE TUBE</li>
      <li>I bought the plus white 5 minute maximum whitening speed gel with the tartar whitening pre-rinse and mouth guard on amazon before and was very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Instead of a nice gel, all three bottles were filled with a liquified product and air.</li>
      <li>and wow my teeth are beautiful.  </li>
      <li>I used to love this product, it was easy to use, cheap and worked.   </li>
      <li>It seemed to work fine.</li>
      <li>find that this is a cheap and painless way to whiten teeth</li>
      <li>Plus White Gel works great.</li>
      <li>I love my smile and so does everyone else...</li>
      <li>Amazing product, could see a difference straight away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to continue to follow the directions on this.  </li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s worth the price, and results apparently vary greatly.</li>
      <li>works perfect and you can see some results after a few uses!</li>
      <li>It was aweful and nothing like the original product I bought.</li>
      <li>and they were so kind to send me a new tube</li>
      <li>After a full tube my teeth are 90% where I would like them in terms of brightness.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this product, especially after reading so many raving reviews!</li>
      <li>I persisted with this product in spite of the fact that the mouth tray doesn&#x27;t fit my mouth at all, doesn&#x27;t keep the gel in contact with my teeth, and, in the end, is only minimally effective.</li>
      <li>Goes really quickly when on the computer.</li>
      <li>So, after using the entire tube for generally ten to fifteen minutes twice a day, I did notice a difference, but I didn&#x27;t enjoy the incredible results that some others have claimed.</li>
      <li>Fair deal, not gentle, effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works quickly and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product does not irritate my gums or make my teeth sensitive, unless I whiten more than once a day.</li>
      <li>Def worth the $$$$$$...</li>
      <li>Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and maintained a nice white smile.</li>
      <li>People comment on how white my teeth are and how nice they look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as if it has removed 10 years worth of stain on my teeth in just 10 days.</li>
      <li>the almost $6 for S&amp;H isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
      <li>a few days of use and the whites are whiter and you seem to smile more :)</li>
      <li>but Plus White is far more convenient and quick!</li>
      <li>My husband and daughter use this religiously and find it truly worthwhile.  </li>
      <li>There have to be a better whitening product out there that actually works.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased these many times at the store and never did they have such notices inside.  </li>
      <li>Can be too strong when left in the mouth but can also  be a gentle toothpaste that is also a whitener is used judiciously.</li>
      <li>This stuff is dirt cheap, and whitens and brightens my choppers to the the point that my dentist constantly asks what I&#x27;m using to keep my teeth so ivory.</li>
      <li>what can i really say it whitens</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth!&lt;br /&gt;Tried strips</li>
      <li>The product says to use it twice a day for 5 minutes each time, and up to 20 minutes for very stained teeth.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
      <li>just think you need to make sure that the mouth guards you choose are the right size for your mouth, or atleast long enough to cover the teeth that are visible when you smile/</li>
      <li>I used to smoke and have super white teeth (even while I was still smoking 24/7), thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>Is there any decent whitening product out there?</li>
      <li>Anyway, I highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>the compliments are frequent!!</li>
      <li>I bought 6 tubes and they were all liquid, and curiously there was a slip of paper in the box saying \\&quot;IMPORTANT:</li>
      <li>People constantly compliment my smile.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I was a little skeptic because the cheap price, but went and bought it anyways.&lt;br</li>
      <li>a huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>Now I am ready for the next application, having had my teeth cleaned again yesterday.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive.</li>
      <li>but I would much prefer this for a couple minutes over those 2 hour strips considering it works the same.</li>
      <li>i am using Rembrandt products last 2 years for the whole family.</li>
      <li>It only whitens as much as you want, just use it less often if you want to naturally brighten your smile.</li>
      <li>but my friend, whom is also a graphic designer, asked how I get my teeth so white, because she said she had to whiten her teeth (which are pretty white) in every picture we took together.</li>
      <li>My teeth were only slightly yellow and mainly on the incisors.</li>
      <li>I bought this since I am a smoker (shame on me) and any smoker knows that it really makes your teeth not pretty.</li>
      <li>My teeth were pretty white to begin with, but I had some slight stains on the bottom row, they were noticeably whiter.     </li>

<li> My teeth were pretty white to begin with, but I had some slight stains on the bottom row, they were noticeably whiter.     </li>
<li> The new tubes are smaller than the previous style of this whitener, but there is a smaller nozzle that makes it easier to put in a tooth tray.</li>
<li> The gel in the second (and third box) also was quite sticky in my mouth and hard to rinse out, which was not the case with the first one.</li>
<li> but they had a yellow tint, long story short after using this product once in the morning &amp; once at night (15-20 minutes)</li>
<li> I left the cap off the tube, since some reviews suggested that the tube might explode if left a long time.</li>
<li> This is not the greatest whitener because it is messy, it is not easy to use because you have too keep it of your skin and that is almost impossible.</li>
<li> Plus 3 will last a LONG time.</li>
<li> Long term user of Plus White 5 Minute Whitening.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why it doesn&#x27;t last longer but still, if you want white teeth within a few weeks, this product is worth it.</li>
<li> I do agree that the mouthpiece is kind of uncomfortable and because of that, I sometimes go without using this product for a few weeks.</li>
<li> Unfortunately the last 2 tubes I bought turned into water (from what was the original gel consistency) after opening them.</li>
<li> ordered this in winter time to Indiana which is not warm at all, but the real concern is that they put these notices in the boxes.  </li>
<li> As long as you use it like it says.</li>
<li> it will make your teeth and gums too sensitive and you will run into trouble.    </li>
<li> If they are too long you can just cut them shorter.</li>
<li> I have not noticed any discomfort in my teeth, no more and no less ice sensitivity, they don&#x27;t feel any different at all, they just look</li>
<li> Plus White 5 Minute Maximum Whitening Speed works extremely well.    </li>
<li> Something that should be known is that once you stop using it for just a few weeks, your teeth go back to their former color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing product, could see a difference straight away. Product was really thick compared to the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Have recommended thus to my friends</li>
    <li> Plus White Gel works great. I use a little Gel combined with my regular toothpaste on my toothbrush in the morning and at night. I keep the foam in my mouth for at least 5 minutes while I wash my face and shave and my teeth turn out very white. People comment on how white my teeth are and how nice they look.</li>
    <li> I purchased the one with the rinse and mouth tray but since the gel is the same, I wanted to post a review here to warn others.     The product says to use it twice a day for 5 minutes each time, and up to 20 minutes for very stained teeth. My teeth were only slightly yellow and mainly on the incisors. Since the instructions said I could use it up to 20 minutes each time, I figured if I did that, I would be done with this in a week.    I have used this product (including the rinse and mouthgiuard) for the past 30 days, twice a day for at least 20 minutes each time and sometimes 30, but my teeth are still yellow. If you do the math, that&#x27;s the equivalent of using the product twice a day for 5 minutes each time for 120 days or 4 months! The product did lighten my teeth a few shades but it is much like the 600 pound person who loses 300 pounds, they are still fat. I even did an experiment like others but unlike them, I never told my wife I was using this. I wanted to see if she noticed a difference. Thirty days later and she never said a word about my teeth looking whiter.     The product did not even last 14 days. By day 10 I had to buy another package. This second package was in an identical box but the ingredients list for the gel was different. The gel in the second (and third box) also was quite sticky in my mouth and hard to rinse out, which was not the case with the first one. I emailed the customer support via the contact email address on their website to ask what the difference was but never received a reply. I guess when you make a bad product you you don&#x27;t care, or are too lazy to reply to email.    If you think you are going to use this twice a day for 5 minutes each time and have white teeth in two weeks you are crazy. If you do, then they were white to begin with and you don&#x27;t need this product. I am going to ask for a refund per their website, but I don&#x27;t expect to get one.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for me which is why I&#x27;m giving it one star.  It doesn&#x27;t even begin to break the pop and tea stains that are now forming on my teeth from years of drinking these two.  My teeth are fairly white but there are areas where the stains are visible and I would like to get rid of that. Because I don&#x27;t have dental insurance I have to work with what I can afford.  I&#x27;ve kept this gel on my teeth for more than 5 minutes as well and after five uses my teeth still looks the same.  If you read my Arm &amp; Hammer white booster review you&#x27;ll see that this product doesn&#x27;t do justice either.  It irritates my tongue, it&#x27;s messy, and, the mouth guard that comes with this is uncomfortable from having to &#x27;slightly&#x27; grip my teeth is also the reason for the one star.  It doesn&#x27;t remove hard stains like I thought.  There have to be a better whitening product out there that actually works.  I only purchased one pack of this and the almost $6 for S&amp;H isn&#x27;t worth it.  Neither is this product.</li>
    <li> I persisted with this product in spite of the fact that the mouth tray doesn&#x27;t fit my mouth at all, doesn&#x27;t keep the gel in contact with my teeth, and, in the end, is only minimally effective. Since I did get some, very slight, I think, whitening effect (hard to tell), I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one. Is there any decent whitening product out there?</li>
    <li> This works great and fast! Does not hurt my teeth or gums.    A++++++++++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a about a week, 15 minutes each day with no noticeable difference in whiteness in the end.</li>
    <li> I bought the single tube and used the product for about three weeks--twice a day, up to fifteen minutes each time--and at the end (when the product ran out), I did notice a difference. My teeth were pretty white to begin with, but I had some slight stains on the bottom row, they were noticeably whiter.     So, after using the entire tube for generally ten to fifteen minutes twice a day, I did notice a difference, but I didn&#x27;t enjoy the incredible results that some others have claimed. I have a hard time believing their results occurred in a matter of days and with only five minute sessions. Perhaps I have denser, more stubborn teeth than they...    Still, it&#x27;s worth the price, and results apparently vary greatly.</li>
    <li> Plus White 5 Minute Maximum Whitening Speed works extremely well.    A few months ago I asked my dentist how much would it cost for a teeth whitening. His reply... $700.00! Yikes! I thought that I might have to spring for it as my teeth over the years have become gray and dingy with drinking a half pot of coffee every morning.     I decided to try Plus White 5 Minute Maximum Whitening Speed and picked it up locally. Wow! After the third time I could definitely see a whitening of my teeth (No placebo effect!) After a full tube my teeth are 90% where I would like them in terms of brightness. I purchased this 3 Pack to brighten my teeth a touch more and the rest for maintenance. So a $700 whitening job only cost about $30 with Plus White 5 Minute Maximum Whitening Speed.    The whitening treatments go for about 20-30 minutes, once or twice a day. Goes really quickly when on the computer.</li>
    <li> I have a slight yellow stain to my teeth but after using this product, it has since, vanished. My teeth went from off white to completely white within 3 weeks. I&#x27;m sorry to see all the negative reviews as I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re using the product correctly. I do agree that the mouthpiece is kind of uncomfortable and because of that, I sometimes go without using this product for a few weeks. Something that should be known is that once you stop using it for just a few weeks, your teeth go back to their former color. I&#x27;m not sure why it doesn&#x27;t last longer but still, if you want white teeth within a few weeks, this product is worth it.</li>
    <li> Great!!! Leave it on for 10 minutes though.</li>
    <li> I used to love this product, it was easy to use, cheap and worked.   Unfortunately the last 2 tubes I bought turned into water (from what was the original gel consistency) after opening them. I don&#x27;t understand why that keeps on happening. I called the company up and they were so kind to send me a new tube although I can&#x27;t keep on calling them and this keeps on happening to me. Once it turns into water there is no way to turn it back into gel and it&#x27;s much more difficult to apply as it won&#x27;t stay on your teeth and would fall on your lips starting to tingle and burn.   I wish I could find a solution.</li>
    <li> This is not the greatest whitener because it is messy, it is not easy to use because you have too keep it of your skin and that is almost impossible. I would not recomnment it to anyone. I blowed my money on this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 10 minutes, 2 times a day, every second day for 10 days and I have noticed a big difference in the color of my teeth. Before they were brownish yellow, now they appear a lighter yellow. It&#x27;s as if it has removed 10 years worth of stain on my teeth in just 10 days. However, make sure not to get any of the gel on your gums, as in can sting and get reddish after use. I have not noticed any discomfort in my teeth, no more and no less ice sensitivity, they don&#x27;t feel any different at all, they just look whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I find that this is a cheap and painless way to whiten teeth and I can only recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;I just think you need to make sure that the mouth guards you choose are the right size for your mouth, or atleast long enough to cover the teeth that are visible when you smile/laugh/yawn etc. If they are too long you can just cut them shorter.</li>
    <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far. It also doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive. I&#x27;ll leave it in for anout 15 minutes while i shower. It does sometimes make my gums white for ten minutes or so afterward and they can get a tad sensitive, but nothing uncomfortable that would make me use this less.</li>
    <li> Great transaction - items as described - fast shipment!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> People ask me all the time how I get my teeth so white. I am a graphic designer and never have to whiten my teeth in any pictures... but my friend, whom is also a graphic designer, asked how I get my teeth so white, because she said she had to whiten her teeth (which are pretty white) in every picture we took together. People constantly compliment my smile. I tried Crest White-strips and Rembrandt Whitening System, before I tried this product. It works faster and more effectively. I use this product with teeth whitening trays. I used to smoke and have super white teeth (even while I was still smoking 24/7), thanks to this product. I love my smile and so does everyone else... the compliments are frequent!! They also sell the product at Walgreen&#x27;s. This product lasts forever too. I buy about two bottles a year and whiten my teeth about once a month (after initially getting them white). The product does not irritate my gums or make my teeth sensitive, unless I whiten more than once a day. I pop the whitening trays in my mouth before I take a shower (this stuff makes you want to spit a little... so this works well). Also, DO NOT brush your teeth and then whiten them... it will make your teeth and gums too sensitive and you will run into trouble.    Def worth the $$$$$$... it is the cheapest you will find and works!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Can be too strong when left in the mouth but can also  be a gentle toothpaste that is also a whitener is used judiciously.</li>
    <li> what can i really say it whitens teeth yay i saw a change not a huge one but it helped  little bit not sure if ill buy again</li>
    <li> Long term user of Plus White 5 Minute Whitening.  IT WORKS!  That&#x27;s the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth!&lt;br /&gt;Tried strips but Plus White is far more convenient and quick!</li>
    <li> I bought this since I am a smoker (shame on me) and any smoker knows that it really makes your teeth not pretty. I used this and wow my teeth are beautiful.  As long as you use it like it says. 15 to 20 mins twice a day for 2 weeks then use it for touch ups.  My teeth were whiter in one day.  Can&#x27;t say enouph about how great this is expecially for the price.  Plus 3 will last a LONG time.</li>
    <li> Been using for over a week twice a day 15 min each time and I&#x27;m seeing no difference whatever. I would think there would be even a slight improvement. I&#x27;m only doing my upper teeth so I can compare to the lower. Nothing!!!Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER GAVE ME SOME AND I HAVE RE-ORDERED IT.  GOOD STUFF.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I apply it with a q-tip and put a mouth guard in while I shower and it works perfect. It is a bit messy but I would much prefer this for a couple minutes over those 2 hour strips considering it works the same.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  It&#x27;s important to continue to follow the directions on this.  I actually keep it on longer and have no issues with that.  My wife bought some very expensive teeth whitener and I tried using it and made my teeth no whiter than with the plus white.  The only difference with it was that my gums were irritated for a few days.  I have no issues with the plus white.  Anyway, I highly recommend this.  I have had several people ask how I keep my teeth so white.  Additionally, you cannot beat the price over other teeth whitening gels.</li>
    <li> WORST! I bought the plus white 5 minute maximum whitening speed gel with the tartar whitening pre-rinse and mouth guard on amazon before and was very happy with the product. This time, I thought buying this product would be good to replenish since I already had the mouth guard. It was aweful and nothing like the original product I bought. Instead of a nice gel, all three bottles were filled with a liquified product and air.</li>
    <li> I use a whitening toothpaste, this product helps brighten my teeth even more.  I have not found anything else  that works as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 30 minutes each day for the past week.  I find absolutely no noticeable difference...  a huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 7 months ago, and used it once. It seemed to work fine. My next application was to be 6 months later, after the dentist cleaned my teeth the next time - I use a tooth whitener after the dentist cleans my teeth so that I will be whitening the teeth, not the tartar or whatever that might come over the teeth. I left the cap off the tube, since some reviews suggested that the tube might explode if left a long time. Now I am ready for the next application, having had my teeth cleaned again yesterday. Unfortunately, the gel has completely liquified and turned the consistency of water, making it totally unusable.</li>
    <li> Sense I have crooked teeth this product was the only thing I could use. I use the Q-tip option and it works great. I will continue to buy this product.  :D</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this here. My store isn&#x27;t carrying it any more. I only use this once in a while to keep my teeth white. You can just brush it on if you like. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product, especially after reading so many raving reviews! I was a little skeptic because the cheap price, but went and bought it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth werent cheesy yellow but they had a yellow tint, long story short after using this product once in the morning &amp; once at night (15-20 minutes) ....my teeth only got maybe one shade lighter not even. Its been a month!&lt;br /&gt;Highly dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;Going to go with Crest White Strips like I had planned,.sometimes cheaper isnt always better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m slightly obsessed with my pearly whites. This stuff is dirt cheap, and whitens and brightens my choppers to the the point that my dentist constantly asks what I&#x27;m using to keep my teeth so ivory. A must have.</li>
    <li> i am using Rembrandt products last 2 years for the whole family. this time it was the worst experience in my life. i ordered 3 packs!!!!&lt;br /&gt;when i open my order the cover was wet. later i realized that it was gel coming out from the tube as my hands were all in the gel. but it is not the end of the sad story. it appeared to be very badly damaged!!! THE GEL WAS COMING OUT FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TUBE!!!!! AT THE TOP OF THE TUBE THE GEL WAS SO HARD THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE IT OUT!!! ALL IN ALL, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE IT AND THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS TO THROW IT INTO GARBAGE. that is what i did.</li>
    <li> My husband and daughter use this religiously and find it truly worthwhile.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but we are happy to be able to get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought 6 tubes and they were all liquid, and curiously there was a slip of paper in the box saying \\&quot;IMPORTANT: If the Plus White Gel is of liquid or water consistency, it is possible that the product was affected by excessive heat or other conditions and will not perform properly\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this in winter time to Indiana which is not warm at all, but the real concern is that they put these notices in the boxes.  I have purchased these many times at the store and never did they have such notices inside.  It seems like they knew the product was bad already....hmmmm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed and I bought the boxes to take with me abroad, where I can not ship them back for the promised refund</li>
    <li> it does what it says... a few days of use and the whites are whiter and you seem to smile more :)</li>
    <li> Good deal on a 3-pack. I will buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> works perfect and you can see some results after a few uses! definitely gonna buy it again</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, the product they sent ran out in liquid form, no gel at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
    <li> I have always had great results with this brand. Slick teeth helps keep food from sticking to your teeth as well as whiting my teeth! Nice purchase.</li>
    <li> Fair deal, not gentle, effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works quickly and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive teeth will, however, make you want to die.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and maintained a nice white smile. It only whitens as much as you want, just use it less often if you want to naturally brighten your smile. The new tubes are smaller than the previous style of this whitener, but there is a smaller nozzle that makes it easier to put in a tooth tray.</li>
    <li> This items arrived in a liquid form and not a gel.  I had to throw the entire package away since it leaked through the envelope it was packaged in.</li>
    <li> Whitens teeth in 5 minutes, just like it says. May liquify a bit with age. Better price than most. Have had no teeth sensitivity at all when using it.</li>
