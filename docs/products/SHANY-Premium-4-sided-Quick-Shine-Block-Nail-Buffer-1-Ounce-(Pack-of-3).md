      <li>LOVE IT!!!  </li>
      <li>They do a beautiful job of smoothing and buffing nails.  </li>
      <li>GREAT DUMBY LIKE LABELS</li>
      <li>Great for taking care of my nails.</li>
      <li>These are great nail blocks you can use the roughest edge for filing or for roughing up your nail bed in preperation for nail treatments.</li>
      <li>These blocks were a great stocking stuffer for my friends and family.</li>
      <li>THIS 3 PACK IS PERFECT AND CHEAP!  </li>
      <li>and as she puts it &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;  will buy more of these as we need them.</li>
      <li>I bought these for my wife and daughters and they love using them for their mother/daughter pedi times together.</li>
      <li>They are okay.</li>
      <li>but they just dont buff as well as most do.</li>
      <li>I may not have the magic touch</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve seen better.</li>
      <li>BUYING MORE.</li>
      <li>You are better off buying one good one than paying for these three that do absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>Adds great shine to natural nails too!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and re-use to keep your nails shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>The filing sides (1 and 2)are fine, but sides 3 and 4 (smooth and shine) are not.</li>
      <li>So I hope that Amazon&#x27;s pictures and labels are accurate.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for something to completely smooth the tips of my nails after filing.</li>
      <li>darned cheap and buffs like it should.  </li>
      <li>These products were cheap and junky all together.  </li>
      <li>3.blue &#x3D; smooth nail  </li>
      <li>You can feel the difference between the sides of the cube and it gives nails a nice shine, they feel smooth and natural   </li>
      <li>I have used plenty of these with different brand names, these don&#x27;t seem as good as others I have used.  </li>
      <li>Purchased for my fiance, they arrived quickly and are just as good as the ones you get at Target, definitely recommended for the price!</li>
      <li>Second, and most importantly, the description said it smooths the nail.</li>
      <li>Not even worth the time to read the description of the item.  </li>
      <li>That being said, it&#x27;s not as good as some other buffers that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>nice easy to grab on and smooth out tiny and long nails  </li>
      <li>/&gt;these don&#x27;t do quite the same job, buff not quite as nice and wears off quicker, but as they were dramatically cheaper, can&#x27;t really complain</li>
      <li>bought some higher end nail buffers for a gift that were amazing and the buff lasted a long time&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would get one from Sally&#x27;s or spend the extra two bucks on a better version.</li>
      <li>First of all, mine didn&#x27;t come with any labels telling which side is which.</li>
      <li>Sure enough.  </li>
      <li>well they work fine (could have a little more shine)</li>
      <li>I really had to press hard and use each side for a while on my nails before I got any good results.</li>
      <li>these dont really do anything.</li>
      <li>I got this 3-pack mainly because of the price.</li>
      <li>Using this fluffy cube, I&#x27;ve been able to show off my natural bare nails   </li>
      <li>I was able to file the tips of my nails with one side and pressed really hard for a while on the others to no avail.</li>
      <li>It is completely just for shine.</li>
      <li>While these SHANY Premium 4 sided Nail Buffers are easy to handle and worked well enough, they didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>Are you serious, you need more words 20?  </li>
      <li>It took forever to smooth out my nail, and after 10 minutes of buffing the same nail, side 4 only gave a mediocre shine to the top 1/3 of my nail.</li>
      <li>These little blocks have just the right &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; for each side.  </li>
      <li>I usually get my buffer block from Sally&#x27;s for about $2, and  am able to buff and shine my entire nail in about 3 minutes or less per finger.</li>
      <li>I did give it a good try but with bad results.  </li>

    <li> darned cheap and buffs like it should.  however the sides aren&#x27;t labelled and the colors are odd, so you just have to feel your way around it.</li>
    <li> I got this 3-pack mainly because of the price. However, it fails to deliver. The filing sides (1 and 2)are fine, but sides 3 and 4 (smooth and shine) are not. It took forever to smooth out my nail, and after 10 minutes of buffing the same nail, side 4 only gave a mediocre shine to the top 1/3 of my nail. I usually get my buffer block from Sally&#x27;s for about $2, and  am able to buff and shine my entire nail in about 3 minutes or less per finger. I would get one from Sally&#x27;s or spend the extra two bucks on a better version.</li>
    <li> I looked at the other reviews after i ordered these and worried that it wouldnt work well or i wouldnt figure out which side is which. well they work fine (could have a little more shine) and they are labeled. for those who dont have labeled ones  1.orange &#x3D; file nail tip  2.pink &#x3D; remove ridges  3.blue &#x3D; smooth nail  4.green &#x3D; shine nail</li>
    <li> This product did do what it was supposed to, which was, make my nails shiny. That being said, it&#x27;s not as good as some other buffers that I&#x27;ve tried. I really had to press hard and use each side for a while on my nails before I got any good results. There are buffers out there that do the same job in less time.</li>
    <li> All 4 sides are just about useless. Colorful but useless.  Are you serious, you need more words 20?  Waste of time plus the money spent plus time trying to make these work . Buffing isnt even ......</li>
    <li> First of all, mine didn&#x27;t come with any labels telling which side is which. Second, and most importantly, the description said it smooths the nail. I was looking for something to completely smooth the tips of my nails after filing. This doesn&#x27;t do that at all. It is completely just for shine. And even then, it does shine but I&#x27;ve seen better.</li>
    <li> nice easy to grab on and smooth out tiny and long nails  Using this fluffy cube, I&#x27;ve been able to show off my natural bare nails   You can feel the difference between the sides of the cube and it gives nails a nice shine, they feel smooth and natural   I recommend this</li>
    <li> THIS 3 PACK IS PERFECT AND CHEAP!  GREAT DUMBY LIKE LABELS TO HELP U WITH WHAT SIDE IS WHAT.  LOVE IT!!!  BUYING MORE.</li>
    <li> Oh Please don&#x27;t waste your money! In the goodwill bag it goes.   :( I did give it a good try but with bad results.  I will try another block.</li>
    <li> These blocks were a great stocking stuffer for my friends and family. Easy to use and re-use to keep your nails shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Horrible. The only side that actually works is the the first side (nail file); the other three sides are completely useless. This product is a complete waste of money! You are better off buying one good one than paying for these three that do absolutely nothing. I received the order today, and it is going in the trash!</li>
    <li> I just received these, so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the file yet.  However, the sides aren&#x27;t labled like in Amazon&#x27;s picture.  I had to refer back to the product picture on Amazon to write instructions for myself.  So I hope that Amazon&#x27;s pictures and labels are accurate.  The manufacturer should include instructions or print them on the sides of buffer.</li>
    <li> These are great nail blocks you can use the roughest edge for filing or for roughing up your nail bed in preperation for nail treatments. Adds great shine to natural nails too!</li>
    <li> Will reorder when I need them. Great for taking care of my nails. Makes them look like they were done by a pro.</li>
    <li> Not even worth the time to read the description of the item.  Tried this twice and did not even get a hint of shine.  I was able to file the tips of my nails with one side and pressed really hard for a while on the others to no avail.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these things!  Durable and as she puts it &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;  will buy more of these as we need them.</li>
    <li> I purchased something similar from Target for $1, so I was a bit disappointed with the lack of shine these gave.  Would not purchase again and do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my fiance, they arrived quickly and are just as good as the ones you get at Target, definitely recommended for the price!</li>
    <li> While these SHANY Premium 4 sided Nail Buffers are easy to handle and worked well enough, they didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I have used plenty of these with different brand names, these don&#x27;t seem as good as others I have used.  They are okay.</li>
    <li> these dont really do anything. Mine did come with the writing on them but they just dont buff as well as most do. After just a few uses, it had to be replaced. I would not buy this again. Its either too rough or not enough to even buff the nail. save ur money.</li>
    <li> These little blocks have just the right &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; for each side.  I had been looking for a similar product for some time before seeing these on Amazon while looking for something else.  I bought it on a whim, hoping they would be what I needed.  Sure enough.  They do a beautiful job of smoothing and buffing nails.  No nail polish needed!</li>
    <li> I hate these. I would have given it zero stars but well, you all know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have nothing written on each side to let you know which side to use in what order. So they are useless, plus I couldn&#x27;t tell which side was smoothest or roughest generally. I may not have the magic touch but I just couldn&#x27;t tell. So they were useless to me. I do NOT recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes they do show text on the sides in the picture but the ones I received had NO text on them. So maybe they have updated the product since then but I won&#x27;t rebuy the product in order to find out.</li>
    <li> These products were cheap and junky all together.  I was not happy with them and ended up giving them to my 7 year old daughter to play around with because they served no purpose for me.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife and daughters and they love using them for their mother/daughter pedi times together. Works great!</li>
    <li> The Shany buffers were like cardboard...they did not work at all.  I am a nail technician and ordered these for our salon.  I used one and sent them back because they are like cardboard...didn&#x27;t buff on any of the sides.  Very disappointing.  Amazon did have them picked up and refunded my money.</li>
    <li> bought some higher end nail buffers for a gift that were amazing and the buff lasted a long time&lt;br /&gt;these don&#x27;t do quite the same job, buff not quite as nice and wears off quicker, but as they were dramatically cheaper, can&#x27;t really complain</li>
