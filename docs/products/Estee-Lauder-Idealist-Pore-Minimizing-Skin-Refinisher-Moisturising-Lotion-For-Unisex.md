      <li>it&#x27;s really a stellar product, which I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well respected product at a relatively reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Gentle scent,&lt;br /&gt;absorbs</li>
      <li>This item arrived with the box in great shape but the pump on the bottle was broken and serum was leaking out.  </li>

      <li>For my skin, this is the ultimate product, my skin is never  as smooth, clear,  as when I use this product.</li>
      <li>quickly by the skin, leaving instant baby-skin smoothness and</li>
      <li>i highly recommend this stuff.</li>
      <li>My friends from high school say I look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It plumps up wrinkles and your skin feels very silky soft after applying.</li>
      <li>I have never found any other product that makes my skin feel this smooth.</li>
      <li>Outside of tanning 3 times/month and smoking 5 cigarettes per day, I take extremely good care of my skin and really do look 5 to 10 years younger than my current 32 aged self.</li>
      <li>The only thing I noticed then was that I had a large scar on the tip of my finger.(The finger I used to dab the lotion on with).</li>
      <li>Never had any reactions or break outs to my sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>So that was completely my fault and nothing the company did wront.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin soft, minimizes the APPEARANCE of the pores, keeps my skin matte all day...</li>
      <li>The box and container were correct and as expected, but the contents were most certainly not the correct moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money spent!</li>
      <li>Clean your face well in the evening and put on a few drops of Idealist before you put on your moisturizer.</li>
      <li>So, skip the rest, try this but be realistic about the fact that your pores will not disappear, they will just appear smaller.</li>
      <li>you get is the APPEARANCE of small pores and softer skin b/c of the thickish silicone film that you are rubbing all over your face, diffusing light and adding smoothness.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this serum directly from Estee Lauder for years and this serum did not smell the same as what I get from Estee Lauder</li>
      <li>/&gt;After use it everyday, It much worth to my face.</li>
      <li>You deserve it, although it is expensive, but do not let the skin feel burden, very comfortable products.</li>
      <li>In the morning, a little dab will set your face up for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried and rejected a whole bunch of face care products but this one is definitely a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy</li>

<li> It is the priciest beauty item I use, but it&#x27;s also my secret weapon!</li>
<li> For that price - quite an expensive mistake:(</li>
<li> I think the price is outrageous, but purchase it anyway.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My pores generally are not large. This product goes on nicely under yous moisture cream. Still has only been one and a half week.</li>
    <li> I happen to be a man who loves product. I have a combination, olive skintone that isn&#x27;t sensitive or prone to breakouts. I have some moderate pores on my forehead and nose. Outside of tanning 3 times/month and smoking 5 cigarettes per day, I take extremely good care of my skin and really do look 5 to 10 years younger than my current 32 aged self. I&#x27;ve tried other pore refiners but always come back to this one. It makes my skin soft, minimizes the APPEARANCE of the pores, keeps my skin matte all day...it&#x27;s really a stellar product, which I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My equally product loving mother also raves about this and uses it under her makeup. She has about 28 more years of experimenting with product and a lot more money than I do. So, skip the rest, try this but be realistic about the fact that your pores will not disappear, they will just appear smaller. Great for combination skin, any age, male or female. (The Estee Lauder product in the brown packaging (eye cream and serum) are also top-tier products!)</li>
    <li> Listen up, ladies: this is a pricey product and worth every dime you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Idealist on a shopping trip to Bloomingdales while I was looking for something else. I passed by the counter, spread a dab of this product on my hands and then on my face, touched my face a couple of minutes later to see how it felt and I went \\&quot;OOOOHHHHH!!\\&quot; Your face will feel like the finest silk and this is no exaggeration. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night ever since and I absolutely love it. Clean your face well in the evening and put on a few drops of Idealist before you put on your moisturizer. In the morning, a little dab will set your face up for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried and rejected a whole bunch of face care products but this one is definitely a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy Lind</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and since that time, have had so many compliments on my skin. I never received compliments on my skin before! I put some on after washing and toning my face, and just prior to adding moisturizer and makeup.  While I do not use EL moisturizer (I&#x27;m an Origins girl for skin cleansers and moisturizers), it works great with my moisturizer and under either my EL foundation or MAC foundation (depending on the day). It is the priciest beauty item I use, but it&#x27;s also my secret weapon!</li>
    <li> The box and container were correct and as expected, but the contents were most certainly not the correct moisturizer. It was clear the bottle had been re-filled (though I&#x27;m not sure what with but it had a very different perfume/smell than it was supposed to).</li>
    <li> It worked the way I expected.</li>
    <li> You deserve it, although it is expensive, but do not let the skin feel burden, very comfortable products. it is very good use.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle in a bottle.I am a loyal estee lauder customer for life. I started to using this back in my twenties but I always thought the product was okay being I didn&#x27;t have any wrinkles ,yet.The only thing I noticed then was that I had a large scar on the tip of my finger.(The finger I used to dab the lotion on with). To my amazement it was completely gone.I must have been using this stuff for about a year before I noticed it.Then i realized my face wasn&#x27;t as oily ,either.It really balanced my skin out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now 39 years old and still use it just about every day and my skin is smooth. Never had any reactions or break outs to my sensitive skin. My friends from high school say I look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I love love this stuff! I have huge pores and oily skin, my skin tone is so un even and feels horrible! From day one this product has made such a differance with my skin ( face and neck ) I will never not use this again, just put a little on after cleansing and before your mousiturizer!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Nice at smoothing out the skin and adding moisture. Tried lots of alternative brands but I keep coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> I received THREE (3) bottles of this product in a goody bag, which allowed me ample time to try it and see if any pores were minimized. Sorry folks, I got no actual pore minimizing, no actual skin refinishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get is the APPEARANCE of small pores and softer skin b/c of the thickish silicone film that you are rubbing all over your face, diffusing light and adding smoothness. Any type of silicone-based cream or primer will do this. But after you wash it off, your skin still remains the same. The sugar-based enzymes this product claims to have seems to be negated by the large amount of silicone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through 2 bottles of this and being really frustrated by the claims (which i feel are all visual perception claims, btw), i gave away the third bottle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was not the one usually soled at the make up counter, but this is the uni sex and that unfragranted version which has a completely different texture and feel compared to the regular idealist.  So that was completely my fault and nothing the company did wront.</li>
    <li> This item arrived with the box in great shape but the pump on the bottle was broken and serum was leaking out.  The bottle was only half filled of serum, yet there was hardly any serum on the inside of the box which means it was previously opened before being mailed to me.  I&#x27;ve been buying this serum directly from Estee Lauder for years and this serum did not smell the same as what I get from Estee Lauder so it&#x27;s probably not even the same product.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to its claim and does a fantastic job of minimizing pores with an almost invisible feel to it. Well worth the money spent!</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer under my makeup every morning for years, and love it.  Have not found anything better.  I think the price is outrageous, but purchase it anyway.</li>
    <li> Well respected product at a relatively reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I knew my daughter would not purchase Idealist Refinisher, so I bought her a bottle and had it shipped to her house.  She loves it and so do I.</li>
    <li> twelve years ago, my boyfriend bought this product at the recommedation of his mother.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it, and LOVED it the minute I smoothed it on my face. Gentle scent,&lt;br /&gt;absorbs quickly by the skin, leaving instant baby-skin smoothness and&lt;br /&gt;softness. I&#x27;m a fan for life</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, and in this case, if you shell out some $$$ you&#x27;ll get the benefits of an excellent serum. Idealist really does a great job of minimizing the appearance of pores, while softening and smoothing skin. It makes my makeup glide on effortlessly after I apply it. i highly recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff works by using silicone (dimenthicone and polysilicone 11) to fill in the pores, however the effect is only temporary.  Once you wash it off, the pores open up again.  Also a check of the ingredients reveals quite a few naughty skin irritants.  So beware of what you put on your skin.</li>
    <li> I am a black woman with oily skin and enlarged pores around my nose. I used this product for the first time in 2006 and kept using it for years. Then I stopped for some cheaper alternative. I have eventually gotten back to it. For my skin, this is the ultimate product, my skin is never  as smooth, clear,  as when I use this product. It is costly but a little goes a very long way. It is worth the investment and works even better now that I am using the Advanced Night Repair serum from Estee Lauder along with it. A keeper for me, as long as I can afford it and as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> This cream delivers what it promises. It plumps up wrinkles and your skin feels very silky soft after applying. After using this cream for a month my skin has definitely shown great improvement.</li>
    <li> It is lovely!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like silk on my face and lovely smell, too.!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After use it everyday, It much worth to my face. Just use it and tell me.^^</li>
    <li> Love this. I have used this product for several years. I love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> After reading a awesome rewievs about a product a was so excited to get it. But I was dissapointed, I&#x27;ve used the whole 1.7OZ boutle and it did nothing to my skin... It sure smells good and makes skin soft, but does nothing with the way it looks. For that price - quite an expensive mistake:(</li>
    <li> I have never found any other product that makes my skin feel this smooth. It gives my make up an even finish. Well worth the $$</li>
