<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This dental cream really works - think that is enough of a review!</li>
    <li> In comparison to Super PoliGrip Extra Care, I find that the Fixodent Plus TrueFeel is anything but. I don&#x27;t know where they got the name, TrueFeel because it most certainly isn&#x27;t. This product does not feel like that at all. And there are other complaints I have about it, but I am going to do a comparison between Super PoliGrip Extra Care and Fixodent Plus TrueFeel so you can make a decision which one you want to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;When I applied Fixodent to my lower denture, the tip was easy to use unlike PoliGrip&#x27;s, which is too large. I always have to use the end of a dental floss tool to smooth the adhesive cream out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Take a hint Poligrip designers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t a strong or nasty taste to either Fixodent or PoliGrip. So that is a plus for Fixodent as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;When I used Fixodent, no matter how little I used, it oozed out into my mouth, leaving it feeling super gooey. It is extremely hard to get out of my mouth and denture. If I use just the right amount of PoliGrip, that does not happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fixodent Plus TrueFeel Adhesive did not keep food from getting under my lower denture while eating. Fixodent, in fact, held particles of food inside the adhesive that caused me a lot of discomfort, especially when eating chips or anything with seeds.  However, it holds my upper in quite well with no food getting under my lower plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fixodent did not stay in very long. I would say about 35 minutes. When I ate, it would lose it&#x27;s hold allowing my lower denture to wobble and come loose, but it held my upper denture in for the whole time I wore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel pretty safe, out in public or during fellowship dinners, with Polident. It stays in for up to 10 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it might be helpful if I gave you the ingredients of both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fixodent Plus TrueFeel: Calcium/Sodium PVM/MA, Mineral Oil, Cellulose Gum, Petrolatum, Silica&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super PoliGrip Extra Care: Poly (Methylvinylether/Maleic Acid) Sodium-Calcium Mixed Partial Salt, Petrolatum, Cellulose Gum, Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), D Alpha Tocopherol Acetate (Vitamin E), Methylparaben, Ethylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope these comparisons help you to make the right decision for you. Maybe Fixodent Plus TrueFeel Adhesive would be right for you, if you have properly fitting dentures.

    <li> I received this product to try for free for my honest opinion from Fixodent.  At first I was not sure how this would work out as I have tried several others that did not stay put in my mouth.  I went according to the directions and only using thin lines of the adhesive on my partial.  Then I put it in my mouth and my partial stuck in place.  I was able to chomp down on food that I had not been able to eat with my partial that was so loose in my mouth.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Held all day for top dentures applied in the morning still adhered at bedtime. No thick ooze. Didn&#x27;t work as well for bottoms but was better than other adhesives I used. I was trying the adhesive free thanks to Fixodent.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t used this product in years because of the zinc. Received a free sample and decided to try it again. No zinc, and it worked great. Holds my dentures in place very well. Will buy in the future!</li>
    <li> I received Fixodent plus free as a promotion I was not satisfied with the security of holding my dentures all day I had a more secure feeling with Fixodent original brand</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this Fixodent.  I liked the way it applied and for the first two hours I thought it felt great.  It even worked well when eating dinner.  However, an hour later was a different story.  My dentures lost all holding and when I took them out there was only one small strip of the adhesive left.  Definitely not good.</li>
    <li> Not a very good product, will hold not dentures very good.  Off brand product worked much better.</li>
    <li> Husband has new lower denture and has had problems  with them causing pain, slipping etc until he tried the Fixodent Plus true feel. Now he feels like he can enjoy a meal go out to dinner and not worry. I received this as a Bzz Agent and he is delighted  definitely will buy more</li>
    <li> Fixodent Plus Truefeel was part of a promotion for me to test as a Bizz Agent. I love it. I can now eat corn on the cob again. The taste is great also!</li>
    <li> Got a sample from BzzzAgent.  At first, partial was shifting.  Then I applied my partial to a dry mouth and adjusted the amount of Fixodent and I am so happy I didn&#x27;t give up.  All day, strong, staying power; natural feel, no weird aftertaste...love this product!</li>
    <li> We love Fixodent at our house. It works, never needs reapplied. Buying Fixodent is a smart. As part of a Bzz Campaign product test, I was offered choice of Regular Fixodent, Fixodent plus Scope mouthwash, or Fixodent True Feel. I have now been using Fixodent True Feel for about a month. I like the product, it has a special directed applicator. It works well most of the time. Some foods slip and I need to apply extra. I would use True Feel for those days when I don&#x27;t eat something difficult with a lot of chewing.  For everyday use, I like Regular Fixodent. I think it is nice to have options.  I might try the Fixodent with scope. I am sold and fixed on Fixodent. I have tried others...and Fixodent is the brand for me.  I love being a Bzz Agent. I got to try Fixodent at no cost. I already use Fixodent, so I tried a new formula. I like the new formula, but I love regular Fixodent. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Fixodent. That&#x27;s my honest opinion. Fixodent was my go to brand, before the campaign.</li>
    <li> I received this to try for free from Fixodent for my honest opinion. I opened it up and but it on my denture. It has a great smell. After applying it to my denture, I put them back in my mouth. I was surprised by the way they felt. My dentures were snug and tight. They did not slip at all. I was able to eat without anything getting between my denture and gums. I am glad Fixodent gave me the chance to try it. I recommend this product and hope you are as satisfied as I am...</li>
    <li> Excellent hold and it has no taste at all!  I use a lot less and it keeps out food out.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY STUFF THAT WORKS</li>
    <li> My husband got this from BzzAgent. for free to try. He said that he liked the fact that it did not have zinc in it.&lt;br /&gt;It was the total feel product. Works well and holds all day.</li>
    <li> Have to wonder if they tested this product before marketing it. It is absolutely the worst adhesive out there. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk.</li>
    <li> I have new dentures and was really having a very hard time eating,anything ,I received a free tube of Fixodent from BzzAgent to try for a review. I have been using Fixodent for over a week ,I feel so much more confident, that there not going to flop out while talking or eating. And at last I can eat without fear that they will come out .Fixodent has solved all my proplems with my new dentures.I can smile and not worry,it&#x27;s great.I can tell you it last a long time and no food can get under your dentures,it&#x27;s an all day hold ,you don&#x27;t have to keep running and putting more in.Fixodent also pervents slipping while talking,or eating so talk and eat away. also kill&#x27;s 99% of bad breath. Ihave already bought my next tube so I wont run low.If it work&#x27;s stick to it and it does.</li>
    <li> I receved this product from BzzAgent free. I have used Fixodent with scope since I got my dentures I really like this product no ooz. no thick ugly feeling in my mouth and it holds very well so I do like it and recomend it</li>
    <li> #Gotitfree as a #Bzzagent I got a free sample of Fixodent True Seal.  It was GREAT at keeping anything from getting between my dentures and gums.  As a matter of fact one time during the trial when I used it I could not get the dentures out for three days.  I did not use too much or more than I normally would use but I could not break the seal.  Not this could be good or bad, it still did what it was suupposed to do but were my gums getting sore from not having a rest from the dentures.  Even with that little incident I think I have found my go to adhesive, I loved it.  The seal was perfect and nothing got between them.  I have told my ladies group about this and of course they told their husbands so I know that at least 3 have tried it so far.  I also have heard nothing but good things back from them.  Good product</li>
    <li> I normally use a competitor dental adhesive, but then Fixodent sent me a free tube to try in exchange for my unbiased review.  On examining the tube, I was pleased to see that it is zinc free, something that is important to me.  The tube was easy to open and the adhesive was easy to apply.  The adhesive came out of the tube in a thinner line than what I was used to, but I decided to not over apply until I tested it out.  I was pleasantly surprised that there was absolutely no taste whatsoever.  The adhesive took hold almost immediately, and I was glad that I had not applied more than instructed on the tube.  The real test came at mealtime.  I was pleased that the adhesive held tightly no matter what I ate, even hours after application.  Most important, at least to me, is the fact that the Fixodent had a very natural feel, almost making me forget I was wearing dentures.  So, if you haven&#x27;t tried Fixodent, give it a test - I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised !</li>
    <li> Overpriced, undervalued</li>
    <li> Great!  Big improvement on old Fixodent.</li>
    <li> I like it feels natural. No gooey mess. I feel I did not need to use as much as the gooey kind.. It feels good and the taste was good. It held the dentures well and I fill buy it again. I got to try this and give my honest opinion. I feel this is the best one I used.</li>
    <li> Fixodent Plus Truefeel and myself had a true Bonding experience.  This is an easy applicator that  lets you squeeze out a small amount at a time. It doesn&#x27;t have any flavor which I really like. It sticks good from morning to night. I was using store brand adhesive but since I have tried this I have switched for good.</li>
    <li> Received this free from BzzAgent.  Worked well on my partial with a tight fit.  No taste at all, which I like.  Thin tip applied easily with no ooze.</li>
    <li> I received the product I am reviewing as a try it product from Bzz Agent. I like it, but not as much as the regular one I buy. Tube is smaller and you need to use a bit more of it than normal. It is not as easy to squeeze out. No taste which is okay. Biggest question is this, would I buy it. Probably not. Prefer the other types Fixodent makes.</li>
    <li> seems like it doesn&#x27;t stick as well as the other Fixodent products, Smaller tube,same price I say stick with what you know and love.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00L1I1V3U Fixodent Plus Truefeel Denture Adhesive Cream 2 Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;As a BzzAgent, I was selected to try this free. My review; PROS- 1) No color or flavor added 2) Zinc free 3) Precision  tip controls ooze&lt;br /&gt;CONS- 1) Hold lasts for only a few hours 2) leaves a slimy film in my mouth&lt;br /&gt;This had a tight natural feeling at first but just didn&#x27;t last long enough for me. The precision tip helps control oozing but after just a few hours it seemed to dissolve and left a nasty film in my mouth. I will not replace Poly Grip  with this for these reasons. . However, I have read several great reviews. I can only suggest that you try it for yourself. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> This product woks pretty well. It is able to hold my dentures comfortably in place longer then what I had been using. It is also easier to clean the residue of my gums when I remove my dentures</li>
