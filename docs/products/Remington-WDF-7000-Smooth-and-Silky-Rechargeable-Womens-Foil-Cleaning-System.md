      <li>I read good reviews for this product</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally I think it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
      <li>Being fair complected</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely good razor:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>Good news -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also good for the underarms, bikini area, and anywhere else you&#x27;d need to shave&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one gives me a really good shave.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it because it is the best women&#x27;s shaver out there and comparing to men&#x27;s razors which are from $100 to $200 dollars (I would know since I bought my boyfriend one for the holidays!)I</li>
      <li>and we can now say that after more than 6 months of use it is still working great.</li>

      <li>I love this shaver it is easy to use and works great.  </li>
      <li>But this new shaver is awesome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to replace the solution, but I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s easy to find!    </li>
      <li>Amazon was happy to return it, but my wife likes this unit very much and prefers to unplug it when the cleaning cycle finishes instead of trying to find another unit she likes.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>What more could one ask for in a razor.</li>
      <li>like the self-cleaning feature, although I can&#x27;t say for sure that it actually does anything -- lots of noise that may just be impressive?  </li>
      <li>It really wasn&#x27;t all that great of a shave</li>
      <li>The cleaning system could be better too.</li>
      <li>If the noise \\&quot;more like humming\\&quot; bothers you just fininh your business in the room and hit the button on your way out.</li>
      <li>but I love the convenience of this one and the ease of the self-cleaning option.  </li>
      <li>But i love this shaver now......</li>
      <li>If you are familiar with using an electric razor, you will love this one!  </li>

      <li>I love this electric razor.</li>
      <li>I WAS ABLE TO SHAVE</li>
      <li>Love this razor.</li>
      <li>Need I say more.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that cord and razor is all I had to carry with me--the cleaning unit disconnects for travel.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to be able to justify it to my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It may still get better as it says it can take time to get used to.</li>
      <li>They love them and have been useing them for a while now.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It worked wonderfully, for about 2 months when the same problem occurred again!</li>
      <li>My wife was even more pleased I think with the it as a gift</li>
      <li>Of course nothing is closer than a straight edge blade that my grandfather had but this instrument is great.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s definitely the best razor out there</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my razor for more than a year now.  </li>
      <li>I was very excited about getting this shaver.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very comfortable and easy to use.     </li>
      <li>Good deal for $25.00, but one blade fell off on the first use and I had to fix it.</li>
      <li>Underarms is still not getting a great result, but it&#x27;s ok (much better than other electric shavers I have used, not as good as razor).</li>
      <li>This remington works great even on my adult legs that hadn&#x27;t been shaved in over 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>I loved how fast the product was delivered.</li>
      <li>It shaves really good, very close to the skin without any pain.</li>
      <li>She has owned other Remington razors, but considers this one to be the best one.</li>
      <li>As someone who can no longer use a razor, due to health reasons, I must say that I am so very happy with this shaver.  </li>
      <li>The under arms are closer than with any other electric shaver though I was not as impressed as I was with the leg results.  </li>
      <li>Easy to take on trip also.</li>
      <li>This product has met my expectations and it is well made and easy to use.</li>
      <li>After a cleaning the razor is an EVEN BETTER shave because it gets a special coating on it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good deal for $25.00, but one blade fell off on the first use and I had to fix it. Shaver works well. Not bad for $25.00, but had I paid the full retail price of $99.00 I would have been disappointed. I purchased 2 shavers (one as a gift).</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric razor that worked worth a \\&quot;hoot\\&quot;.  This one is great.</li>
    <li> Works well, shaves close, no pain. No problems so far (purchased about 1 month ago).</li>
    <li> This razor is not worth the money. It did shave pretty well for a few months, but the rubber strips wear out really quickly. And, even though the \\&quot;cleaning option\\&quot; with the fluid seems like a great idea... it does not work very well... the razor was never clean... and refilling the fluid is just a pain... I would not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Runs out of battery way too quickly to be any use to me in shaving my legs. The whole system is fussy and I don&#x27;t even feel I get a good shave with it.</li>
    <li> This product has met my expectations and it is well made and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I read good reviews for this product so I ordered it for a Christmas present.  First off Discount Jungle is who you buy from, not Amazon so you have to pay ALL shipping charges, even if it&#x27;s defective which mine was.  So, not only did I have to pay the 10 for initial shipping, but I had to pay 15 priority mail because they had to have it there in 14 days.  So, I&#x27;m out 25.00 shipping on a 40 dollar product.    Sure wish I had not purchased it!</li>
    <li> I really like this self-cleaning electric shaver.  My only negative comment is that the comfort strip eroded after just a few uses.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver it is easy to use and works great.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> My wife used the shaver 3 times and the screen broke other then that it works well.</li>
    <li> This rechargeable razor battery life is not worth the price.  the battery only lasted 18 mts before it would not take a charge anymore. Not worth the money...........</li>
    <li> I am overall pretty satisfied with the shaver.  I have to admit my former blade gave the smoothest shave but I love the convenience of this one and the ease of the self-cleaning option.  I was a little surprised when the &#x27;charge&#x27; light blinked constantly despite the booklet indicating this meant a charge was needed.  A call to the Remington people informed me it was a misprint in the booklet and blinking actually meant it was fully charged while  steady light meant a charge was needed.  A little confusing but these things happen I guess.  All-in-all, I would buy this again and Amazon&#x27;s price was great.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. Travelled to Australia for 3 weeks, did not have to charge at all--I only use it for underarms. Love the fact that cord and razor is all I had to carry with me--the cleaning unit disconnects for travel.</li>
    <li> This razor is nice looking, but it&#x27;s a discontinued model. That&#x27;s important because when it wouldn&#x27;t charge up we called Remington. They had us find a number on the inside of the unit which indicated the battery was old enough to be shot and unable to hold a charge. Very disappointing. Great looking, but performance is mute due to not being able to ever use it. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money. This one&#x27;s not useful due to the battery shelf life.[[ASIN:B0007XY8VC Remington WDF-7000 Smooth &amp; Silky Rechargeable Womens Foil Cleaning System]]</li>
    <li> Bought for myself and as a gift for my daughter.  Great product when on sale.</li>
    <li> This company shipped me a shaver that would not charge or work even if plugged in.  I sent a mail off to the company and they had a new shaver shipped off to me immediately and I did not even have to send the one that did not work back to the company.  I received the new shaver 2 business days later and used it that day.  It does amazingly on underarms.  It does pretty well on legs.  But it is so simple to use and easy to clean that I love it.  It is very hard to find a rechargeable self cleaning woman&#x27;s shaver, but I would recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> I believe most of the bad reviews for this razor were written by people who have never owned an electric razor before. I have owned several in all sorts of price ranges and never seen one that cuts as close as this one does. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had and you can definitely tell that it was probably a $100 product when it first came out. I will list the few cons it does have, but that wouldn&#x27;t stop me from recommending this razor.    * The cleaning base is pretty big and wouldn&#x27;t be good if you have a small vanity area.    * The handle itself is more narrow than other razors, making it top heavy. I&#x27;m a dry shaver so this isn&#x27;t a problem, but if you shave in the shower I think the small handle plus water could make it a pain to hold onto.    * It shaves very, very closely. You need to let the hair grow several days in between shaving or it causes in-grown hairs. If you&#x27;re an everyday shaver, this one is definitely not for you.    * For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve had it several months now and the charger cord is plugging in really loosely. It&#x27;s still working, but I hope it doesn&#x27;t become an issue further down the road.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver, that I have used, which leaves NO stubble. You have to keep up with keeping it sharp/clean for it to work its best.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a Christmas gift for my Wife and she loves it... so do I.   Not loud at all (shaver)... the cleaning process is a bit but not anything for me to get piss off about.  My Wife has been using this shaver for awhile now and... no complaints.  I would say... works great(silky smooth legs), not loud, and product should last some time.      http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007XY8VC/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> I baught two one for my wife and my daughter. They love them and have been useing them for a while now. It could clean a little better my showed me hers yesturday and it was a little clogged up ,a little cleaning with a little brush, back to new.</li>
    <li> I bought this razer to replace an older model of Remington Smooth and Silky. I was always disappointed with the results of my old one. But this new shaver is awesome. It shaves as close as a blade, which really impressed me after my previous experience. On my old one, it was very easy to accidentally turn it off while shaving. With this new one, I have not had that problem - the button is a better design. I like the cleaning system so far. It seems like it might be slightly challenging to buy extra cleaning bottles - when I ordered the shaver, the 6 pack of cleaning solution was not available. All in all, a fantastic shaver at an unbeatable price, and I got it in about 3 days.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver at the super low price.  The charging light never lit up upon plugging it in.  The shaver could not establish a charge.  I called the manufacturer and they said the batteries (which are not replacable) were dead because the unit was old and discontinued.  I would not buy this product, even though the price has been slashed drastically.  Chances are the unit is obsolete.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchase this Shaver for my wife, she loves it!</li>
    <li> For those of us with sensitive skin this razor is from HEAVEN.  I did not like it at first but follow the directions and use it every day for two weeks to let your skin get used to it. I use it in the shower with a light shave cream and it is a miracle for me-  no nicks, cuts or scrapes and a clean shave. At first, it does not feel as smooth as a razor, but once my skin adjusted the very thought of returning to a razor blade is unbearable.  &lt;br /&gt;The recharger is loud but I don&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s worth it not to have to use a razor blade.  The cleaning solution is pricey too but I use 50:50 rubbing alcohol and since I use it in the shower anyway, it stays pretty clean.  &lt;br /&gt;Watch out for lotions on your skin when you use it, the lotion can clog the razor.</li>
    <li> This Remington shaver works great.  Large head and curve to handle makes shaving simple and easy.  Shaves close with no skin irritation.</li>
    <li> The WDF-7000 looks and shaves and probably uses the same replacement parts as my old Remington WDF-6000! Why doesn&#x27;t Remington create a model with a battery that&#x27;s replaceable! I loved my WDF-6000! I was disappointed when I realized my WDF-6000 wasn&#x27;t recharging anymore and that replacing the battery wasn&#x27;t an option. But the less expensive WDF-7000 works just as well. I&#x27;m use to rinsing the WDF-6000 under a heavy stream of water to clean it. Once you use the WDF-7000 cleaning system, obtaining a cleaned shaver under a heavy stream of water doesn&#x27;t work without using the brush a lot.      Yet do not dispair. It appears that the cleaning solution does lubricate the shaver and may aid in a smoother shave.     I&#x27;ve yet to replace the solution, but I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s easy to find!    Bottom line?  I recommend the WDF-7000.</li>
    <li> I received an older product with nickle in the foil, which makes skin black when used. When I called the company they sent replacement blades, but the plastic protector cover wouldn&#x27;t fit. They sent a replacement; once again it was the old product with the same problem. When I called again, they said all their foils have nickle. Other companies have a stainless protector. Need I say more. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of weeks and it is working fairly well. Underarms is still not getting a great result, but it&#x27;s ok (much better than other electric shavers I have used, not as good as razor). It may still get better as it says it can take time to get used to. Legs work very well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars, simply because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to be sure it is that good.</li>
    <li> As someone who can no longer use a razor, due to health reasons, I must say that I am so very happy with this shaver.  Gets close and I have no problem with razor burn, pulling, reshaving (leaves hairs behind and have to go back over the same place more than 1).  When I shave, it is a relaxation time for me so I do just that and then I don&#x27;t fight with an object.  I thought I&#x27;d be unhappy with any rechargeable shaver, but I am very happy with this one.  It&#x27;s quiet. It competes with the regular razor, for sure. Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I just received a defective one or if it is just piece of poo. Either way it dies before I get even close to shaving both legs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife when she was very happy with her previous one that broke. Sadly it was discountinued everywhere but I purchased it from Amazon anyway. She loves the razor however it arrived with an issue. When the cleaning cycle finishes, it just keeps running until unplugged.  Amazon was happy to return it, but my wife likes this unit very much and prefers to unplug it when the cleaning cycle finishes instead of trying to find another unit she likes.</li>
    <li> I had the Remington WDF-6000 for about five years, but lately it seemed less sharp and didn&#x27;t hold a charge for long so I replaced it with the WDF-7000 for about a third of the price I originally paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was dubious about the cleaning unit, but was very happy to find that you can recharge this unit with just the power cord that goes to the cleaning unit. So there are three parts: the shaver, the cord, and the cleaning unit - and the cleaning unit is optional. This is even better than the old shaver which had one of those stand up rechargers that was bulky to bring on a long trip, and needed counter space to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize that you can also buy replacement blades for these shavers. I will do that with this unit as soon as it starts feeling blunt, as I can really tell the difference (I was starting to get a rash with the old shaver).  There&#x27;s no rash when the blades are crisp and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I did call Remington to enquire about replacing the rechargeable battery and they gave me a number to call. I didn&#x27;t bother to call when I found out how cheap the WDF-7000 was, especially when my old unit also needed new blades!</li>
    <li> This razor is pretty decent for the money that you&#x27;re paying. It has gold foils so your skin will never be irritated. The shave itself is pretty close, I think it does a better job dry than wet but both options work pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a built in cleaner system that you plug the razor into and in 25 minutes, woila! After a cleaning the razor is an EVEN BETTER shave because it gets a special coating on it. It does a great job cleaning but you dont even need to put it to clean that often you can usually just open up the head and blow inside and you&#x27;re rid of the hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is $69 dollars but it&#x27;s worth it because it is the best women&#x27;s shaver out there and comparing to men&#x27;s razors which are from $100 to $200 dollars (I would know since I bought my boyfriend one for the holidays!)I think this is a very good deal.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret buying it, and it shaves your entire leg in around 3 minutes rather than shaving forever with those dispozables that cut and leave your leg bleeding. It&#x27;s also good for the underarms, bikini area, and anywhere else you&#x27;d need to shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely good razor:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Gold Foils-no irritation&lt;br /&gt;2) No cuts ever again&lt;br /&gt;3) Cleaner system that does a great job cleaning the razor&lt;br /&gt;4) Affordable shaver&lt;br /&gt;5) Works fast and saves time&lt;br /&gt;6) Use in or out of the shower-wet/dry&lt;br /&gt;7) Easy grip and smooth design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It makes a bit of noise(nothing that too irritating though)&lt;br /&gt;2) Some people consider $69 too much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I think it&#x27;s a good buy and it&#x27;s definitely the best razor out there and it is the ONLY one that has a cleaning system out there when it comes to women&#x27;s razors :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LATER EDIT: The blade heads get dull after some use and it&#x27;s very loud when being cleaned so if you want to spend more money on the blade heads which are somewhat expensive then do a little more research first.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my wife as a Christmas Gift. She has missed having her electric razor that died a few years ago. This was a home run for Christmas and she has used it several times since it was received. She can not say enough good things about the product except that it cuts close with no residual skin burn after especially in the more tender areas. I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I think this shaver is great. I had a cheaper model for over a year and I was never satisfied. This model even gets the soft hairs on my legs that the others didn&#x27;t. The cleaning system is really nice. It does a good job. I recommend this product to anyone. Excellent choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor for more than a year now.  The rubber edges near the blades tear easiy; I don&#x27;t really know what purpose they serve.  The cleaning fluid is expensive and evaporates quickly.  Also, the metal parts inside the fluid reservoir are rusting!  I&#x27;ve never used water in the reservoir, only cleaning fluid.  The noise during the cleaning really doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I do wish that the shaver got cleaner than it does.  When cleaning is complete, hair is still on the ouside of the unit.</li>
    <li> I am used to an electric shaver. Its a pain to have to recharge this.  It can not be used while being charged. but this shaver works great. It is identical to the hammacher schlemmer \\&quot;best rechargeable shaver\\&quot; but this was 1/2 the price. I dont like to loose a charge in the middle of a shave. However, I selected this product to replace a 45 year old electric which was ready upon plugging in anytime anywhere so it is my fault.I had to replace it because i dropped it and it shattered. But i love this shaver now......its unreal and shaves very closely so i dont have to shave as often.....i would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Much to my wife&#x27;s surprise, this shaver didn&#x27;t cause a rash, burn or stubble shave. \\&quot;Here&#x27;s hoping it remains that way,\\&quot; she said.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Like it very much but the cleaning is a bit noisy.  Other than that I really like it - saves a lot of time over the old wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product step up from the last one. I had that one for a long tmie hoping for the same with this one.</li>
    <li> I have only ever used electric shavers and this one is by far the best I have ever owned.  It gives a very close shave on the legs and does just as well with a few weeks of growth as with a few days.  The under arms are closer than with any other electric shaver though I was not as impressed as I was with the leg results.  The shave is close enough that I can go several days before I have annoying stubble popping back up.  The blades are gentle on the skin too.  The cleaning system is an ecellent bonus and keeps the shaver irritation-free.  Also, this is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve bought where the carrying case has enough room for the charger plug!  I&#x27;m glad someone finally recognized that if you&#x27;re taking the shaver somewhere in its case you&#x27;ll probably want to re-charge it too...</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to spend this much money on a shaver but I am so glad I did. This one gives me a really good shave. I have had it for one month and have not used a hand razor since. Another review says the cleaning process is a bit loud, which it is but since you turn it on and leave it, I just close the bathroom door so the noise is not a problem.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for 6 months and absolutely love it!  I find that I don&#x27;t even have to shave as often as I did with a regular razor and my legs are just as smooth if not smoother.  I have not had any problems using this product on my legs, bikini or underarm area but, I do seem to get better results from shaving dry.  I have never tried using this with shaving cream but when I have used it in the shower or tub I don&#x27;t feel like I get as close of a shave.  I suppose, it probably depends on your hair and skin type. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did notice as others have mentioned that the rubber strips tore quickly but, I do not think that this actually interferes with the closeness nor comfort of the shave.  The small container of cleaning solution that comes with the product does not last long but, is well worth the money to replace on a regular basis to keep your shaver running smoothly and efficiently. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine ever switching back to a regular razor - I even travel with this product and would highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> it shaves legs just fine, although you have to go over the same area a few times before its smooth.  don&#x27;t try to shave anything else.  I tried to do under my arms and my bikini this morning and lets just say I didn&#x27;t win the war. My skin is all cut up. it yanks hair and grabs/cuts skin if you are using on \\&quot;curves\\&quot; like bikini line.  it is only safe on straight surfaces like legs.  it also has been charging since I got it 4 days ago and its still not fully charged.  it is constantly blinking.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver Ive used ever! Its easy to operate and the cleaning/charging base is simple to use too. No negatives about this product. Extremly close shave, smooth results, always ready to use. Easy to take on trip also. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I could give it 10 stars I would.</li>
    <li> This was the first electric shaver I ever owned. After a few months of using it I can safely say I will never go back to a disposable razor again. I get a much better result dry than wet, and have never been cut or experienced any irritation even though I have extremely sensitive skin and ingrown hair.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars because  the merits of the cleaning system are dubious - it sometimes looks dirtier after the cleaning ends. little hairs that were rinsed off before putting it in the system reappear after the cycle is completed, which sort of makes sense since it is swishing around in the same tiny vat of solution, and you&#x27;d probably have to change the solution every day to avoid this (they suggest in the manual that the provided bottle of cleaning solution lasts through about 25 cleanings). Also the two slender rubber strips on either side of the foil area over the blade are almost completely worn away after about a dozen or so uses. I think these were anti-irritation comfort strips or some such, but I still haven&#x27;t been cut now that they&#x27;re tattered and torn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did experience annoying stubble in the first couple of weeks after switching from a blade but don&#x27;t notice that anymore. I need to shave every day thanks to the ingrown hair situation, but this isn&#x27;t the razor&#x27;s fault. All in all I would recommend this product to people with sensitive skin and ingrown hair who tend to cut themselves with a blade every time they shave. If you have normal skin and don&#x27;t experience this problem, you may want to save the money.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS OVER A YEAR AGO, BUT NOT THROUGH AMAZON I JUST WENT TO MY WALMART STORE AND BOUGHT IT AND I LOVE IT, I HATE USING A RAZOR BECAUSE I ALWAYS SEEM TO GET A NICK OR TWO AND THEY HURT, PLUS WHILE I WAS IN THE LAST 2 MONTHS OF MY PREGNANCY THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS ABLE TO SHAVE AND I WAS NOT GOING TO LET MY HUSBAND EVEN TRY TO SHAVE MY LEGS WITH A REGULAR RAZOR, BUT WITH THIS IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.  IT HASN&#x27;T GIVEN ME ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL I HAVE NEVER HAD IT PULL OUT MY HAIR, GIVE ME RAZOR BURN OR ANYTHING...ITS PERFECT IN MY OPINION, AND AT A GREAT PRICE, I HATE GETTING CUT WITH A RAZOR BUT WITH THIS I DON&#x27;T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. YA ITS NOISY WHEN CLEANING BUT YOU DON&#x27;T HEAR IT IF YOUR NOT IN THE SAME ROOM, AND THE CLEANING SOLUTION I JUST GO TO WALMART AND GET IT AND IT ONLY COST MY ABOUT 5 BUCKS.  MY ONLY PROBLEM NOW IS THAT I NEED A REPLACEMENT SCREEN FOR IT BECAUSE MY 3 YEAR OLD TWINS GOT IT AND WERE PLAYING WITH IT AND NOW ITS MISSING A LITTLE CHUNK OF THE SCREEN SO LITTLE YOU CAN&#x27;T HARDLY SEE IT UNTIL YOUR DONE SHAVING AND YOUR LEG IS ALL SCRATCH UP, ROTTEN KIDS ANYHOW.</li>
    <li> I love this electric razor. Gives you a close shave &amp; great to have when traveling.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a very close shave, especially wet, for the legs...no nicks or irritation. I had difficulty with the wet setting for my underarms...with abrasions and a lot of irritation and have learned it works better dry, for the underarms. &lt;br /&gt;Love the cleaning feature and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife in 2010 and always I was very satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s service. My wife was even more pleased I think with the it as a gift and we can now say that after more than 6 months of use it is still working great. My wife says she uses it about once a week and it&#x27;s very comfortable and easy to use.     The box says \\&quot; Worlds #1 shaver\\&quot; and as far as my wife can tell she has no disagreements with that. The shaver cleaner is an added bonus as well.    All pros, No cons. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver!! Love it</li>
    <li> After fulling charging the first time, it never would charge properly again.  The recharge light would intermittently come on and would take about a week to get a decent charge.  I could only run the cleaning function when the green charging light was on, which was infrequently.  After owning it for two months, it now will not charge at all.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and the deal I got on Amazon made it even more wonderful.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t go for the cool looks it carries... It does not give you a good return. Its Noisy and painful. Gifted it to wife but to tell you the truth, she hated it after use.</li>
    <li> If you are considering this product run don&#x27;t walk away as fast as you can. first if you don&#x27;t have a dedicated spot the size of an electric can opener right next to an outlet the cleaning system is a total waste of money. It does an adequate job shaving legs, but unless you have under arms as tough as leather this razor will rip your under arm to shreds and leave them painful for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> this razor literally fell apart after a couple of uses. the blade and screen pieces broke apart through a normal use and trying to clean it out with the brush!!!!i will not be purchasing electronics of any kind on line, unless it is directly with the supplier of the product...</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product I was amazed at the performance. The battery last longer than I anticipated. It shaves really good, very close to the skin without any pain. I love this product. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent and delivery was less than a week.  Very happy with service.</li>
    <li> This product does not work if you have soft blonde hair.  My hair is not coarse and this razor just glided right over top with out cutting a thing.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and seems like it is made well, but it is definatly not for those of us with soft hair.</li>
    <li> If you are familiar with using an electric razor, you will love this one!  I have had many of electric razors, it is all I use, and this one by far gives you the closest shave.  I have never had a razor cut so close and make my legs so smooth.  I am very impressed with this one.  I have had mine for 3 years and am getting ready to order another one.  My old one still works, I have replaced the blades once, but the side soft plastic has melted and looks bad, so I am replacing the whole razor. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I already had an older Remington and thought I would upgrade to a \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; one with a cleaner. I was very excited about getting this shaver. However, the excitement slowly wore off after a few weeks when I could no longer \\&quot;excuse\\&quot; some of the downfalls to it. I really wanted it to work because I really liked it and I wanted to be able to justify it to my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner was a hit and miss from day one. I would cheer if it would actually clean the razor. It also didn&#x27;t charge all the time like it said it would when you put it in the cleaner. Sometimes it would clean the shaver but it wouldn&#x27;t charge the razor. So you would end up having to use the plug in charger to charge the razor. Then the cleaning stuff got to be a bit of a hassle having to find new stuff and refill it. That&#x27;s not to mention the way it shaved. It really wasn&#x27;t all that great of a shave either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this back in 2009, kept it for about a year and then finally threw it out. I just could not take the frustrations with it anymore. I ended up going back to my old razor that uses batteries. I still use it because it is just a great electric razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line on this electric razor, it&#x27;s not all that it&#x27;s made out to be. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my 12 year old after first trying a panasonic.  This remington works great even on my adult legs that hadn&#x27;t been shaved in over 2 weeks.  I had lots of long hair.  Works very quickly, no nicks, no stinging either.  Of course nothing is closer than a straight edge blade that my grandfather had but this instrument is great.  The cleaning system works very nicely too.  I actually turn it on in the morning to wake her up.  Its loud.  If you don&#x27;t want to disturb a sleeping person in the room, don&#x27;t use the cleaner cycle.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted a razor that could clean itself, one that didn&#x27;t pull my hair out, and was always ready to go when I needed a shave.  This razor fits perfectly into that mold.  The charging and cleaning cycle are a bit loud, but you are up and getting ready for work anyway.  It cuts smoothly, doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out(even in those delicate areas), and was priced to sell on Amazon.  5 STARS.</li>
    <li> I have almost always used electric shavers, and this is without a doubt my favorite so far.  Although I clean it about every 3rd-4th use, it always seems to operate so smoothly and leaves my skin soft and close shaven.  I have had it 2 years now, and am just now thinking it is time for a new battery, but blades are still fine.    -added Feb. 2 &#x27;09: Bad news, just found out the battery cannot be replaced and Remington is no longer going to make these or any ladies self-cleaning razor. :(  Good news - This price for them ($33) on Amazon is now cheaper than replacing the screen/blades/battery anyway!  I am going to order 2 more right now to get them before they are gone!</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington&#x27;s 5000 electric rechargable for years....the battery was finally dying, so I decided to replace it with this 7000.  What a great decision!! It is slightly quieter, and has an incredibly close shave.    I occasionally thought about going back to a regular razor with the 5000, but after using this 7000, I will not ever go back.  I haven&#x27;t cleaned it yet, but I am so glad I decided to get this!</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome!  I have purchased Remington razors for 30 years and the WDF7000 is a great razor.  The charging stand and cleaning fluid a bit cumbersome, but the razor does a great job.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Way better than the Panasonic (that didn&#x27;t actually remove any hair) and the Philips (that worked ok but was very slow). Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well... Blades broke rather fast though. The cleaning system could be better too. If you have the means to replace parts constantly I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used but it&#x27;s still not as good as a real shave - which I don&#x27;t do because of an unfortunate prediliction of nicking myself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for 3 months now and find I have to go over areas at least twice, sometimes thrice.  It does work well in the bath as well as \\&quot;dry.\\&quot;  So far I&#x27;ve only used it on my legs, although it has panty-line and underarm settings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the self-cleaning feature, although I can&#x27;t say for sure that it actually does anything -- lots of noise that may just be impressive?  The cleaning solution isn&#x27;t cheap and it looks like it has to be replaced every quarter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am unhappy that a small piece of rubber edgling is already slightly torn -- for no apparent reason.  I&#x27;m waiting to see if it requires a repair to work properly which, if it does, will be EXTREMELY annoying.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver--finally there is a decent women&#x27;s shaver!.  The cleaning system works well.  The only drawback is the difficulty finding replacement cleaning solution--I just had to pay $8 to ship the stuff!  I think I&#x27;ll be formulating my own next time!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality razor.  I previously had a WDF-6000 and wanted to upgrade to a product with a built in cleaning system.  My only complaint would be the constantly blinking charge light on the base.  It&#x27;s a little annoying, especially at night.</li>
    <li> I am on my 4th shaver and even bought new components for current one. Not smooth and not enough charge. Dies after less than 2 minutes. Won&#x27;t buy Remington again.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for a little over 2 years and it has never failed to amaze me on the closeness of the shave. I have extremely sensitive skin  and have never experienced pain or pulling of the hairs. Being fair complected i am prone to razor bumps from conventional razors and since using this I not only get a \\&quot;smooth and silky\\&quot; shave but razor bumps are a thing of the past. I am disappointed than the super store by me has discontinued the replacement blades from their stock but was happy to see it here at amazon. The cleaning mose is great just hit a button and go. If the noise \\&quot;more like humming\\&quot; bothers you just fininh your business in the room and hit the button on your way out. Personally I dont find it bothersome at all when you consider the thing cleans itself. What more could one ask for in a razor. It deserves 5 stars all the way!!</li>
    <li> I loved how fast the product was delivered. I have used the product &amp; its profromence is excellent.</li>
    <li> I have owned this for over a year; it works great, holds a charge for a long time, and has remained intact despite daily use. I have not had a problem with the little rubber strips peeling off, as others have.  And yes, the cleaning solution is expensive and doesn&#x27;t last very long - I haven&#x27;t tried any homemade alternatives.  On my unit,the green \\&quot;charging/charged\\&quot; light never stops blinking, even after days of being on the charger.  It&#x27;s an annoyance, but I never called their service dept.</li>
    <li> One of the best shavers I have ever owned. Unfortunately, it got lost during a move. I tried to reorder another one but the price was up to like, what, $300 on Amazon? What the heck??? Will look for it somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver last September, and at that point I agreed with the other reviewers. It delivered a nick-free shave and was quick and painless to use. This past May, it stopped being able to re-charge and just died completely. I only used the recommended cleaning solution, changed it according to the instructions, and cleaned it after every use. I sent the shaver back to Remington, they were very nice and sent a new replacement shaver after a few weeks. It worked wonderfully, for about 2 months when the same problem occurred again! I&#x27;m sending it back again and hoping for a refund this time, it isn&#x27;t worth my time and money to go to the post office every few months to return yet another defective shaver!</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric shaver for 30 years.I have gone through 3 different syles of shavers this past year since my old remington died. NONE OF THEM WORK WELL. What gives Remington????</li>
    <li> This is the best ladies shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor does a good job shaving, but I only shaved with it maybe six times before it would no longer recharge.  It cannot be repaired so it&#x27;s really a very expensive throw-a-way.  Save your money!!!</li>
    <li> My spouse says the razor gives a smooth, close shave.  Slightly difficult to open to clean.  Overall, very pleased with this razor.  She has owned other Remington razors, but considers this one to be the best one.</li>
    <li> Its convenient to use, no risk of cuts as in razors and hair growth after use is very soft as compared to razors. Cleaning and handling is also very easy, i have found this product to be very confortable to use compared to other methods. Would definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I got this years ago, not long after I got it I realized that to use the cleaner you have to purchase stuff for it. So I wound up stuffing the cleaning unit under the sink because it was so big and bulky it took up too much room on the counter. But the reason I do not like it is because the hand unit broke! within two months of having it the top back part fell off and I kept popping it back on for a little bit but eventually it just fell all apart so I trashed it and bought a new one. I paid A LOT of money for that thing! and it fell apart on me in less than six months!</li>
