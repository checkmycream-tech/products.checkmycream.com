      <li>If you have thin skin or dark circles under your eyes, this will work great.  </li>

<li> I purchased this item along with a skin care kit, therefore, it was alot less than the individual price.  </li>
<li> The product came exactly as expected.</li>
<li> This is one of those creams that doesn&#x27;t cake under eye makeup and gives a shimmer to hide dark circles.  </li>

<li> So I tried putting much less, just a little bit...</li>

<li> I started using Adrienne&#x27;s products in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
<li> I wear it alone or under my makeup everyday and would never ever leave the house without it!!</li>

    <li> excellent product, but stings my eyes</li>
    <li> The more you use ..the better you look</li>
    <li> Have used as long as it has been made.  It is the best!</li>
    <li> the color of the moisturizer is not the same as when I purchased directly from the manufacturer.  It leads me to believe its a knock off.</li>
    <li> It hydrates the skin well. I have dry skin. Would not recommend it to a person with oily skin.  It goes on and feels greasy at first but later the feel improves.  The sunscreen works well but don&#x27;t get it in your eyes..... it burns and you have to wash it out.</li>
    <li> Good stuff at bargain prices</li>
    <li> Have been using for appr. 3 yrs. Use in AM before putting on makeup. Let it absorb. Put extra on lines and wrinkles. Let it absorb. Wipe off any excess after appr. 10 min  then  put on makeup. If not putting on makeup, leave on. Plumps up skin. Great product with A+ ingredients.</li>
    <li> Signature Club good product</li>
    <li> Great product, it arrived very fast. Very happy</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this product it doesn&#x27;t get Creecy throughout the day&#x27;s very comfortable and soothing Will order more</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product of the Signature A series.  I like wearing it underneath my makeup, and it goes on very smoothly.  It doesn&#x27;t make me sweat like some day creams do.  My make-up stays nice, too, when using the day cream.  it is one of the few Signature A products I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 years young because of contributions that Signature Club A and Adrienne&#x27;s consistent devotions to bringing wonderful skin care to all of ladies. I started using Adrienne&#x27;s products in my late 30&#x27;s I can clearly see the benefits through the years! People that know me and strangers a like comment on how wonderful my skin looks and that is nice to hear at any age! I recommend all of Signature Club A products and use as directed - keep this away from sensitive eyes and try using the 5 essentials eye cream. Tip: Their product kits are the best value!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and love it. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I love the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; texture of this day cream and it&#x27;s very moisturizing too! I&#x27;ve heard that SPF&#x27;s in moisturizers tend not to be &amp;#34;strong enough&amp;#34; or work but I know for certain that the SPF (30) in this brand WORKS ! It sure feels much better than applying regular SPF lotions that are heavy and sticky!</li>
    <li> Been using  her products for years. This is one of my favorite  items .</li>
    <li> I am 62 and this has worked great on my .  It plumps up my skin and  I can see an improvement in only a couple of days.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I&#x27;d gotten some neck cream in this same brand that I really liked.  I tried this under my makeup three times, and each time it seemed that by lunch my makeup had disolved, and I wasn&#x27;t getting the coverage that I usually get with my foundation.  I&#x27;ve tried it with two different high-end foundations.  I&#x27;m not sure why it didn&#x27;t work well for me, but I thought maybe it was because I was using too much of it.  So I tried putting much less, just a little bit...the last time I used it, and the exact same thing happened again.  Each time I&#x27;ve used it, I hated how my makeup looked.  I&#x27;ll be using this as a sunscreen and moisturizer for my arms since it has SPF 30, but once I use it up, I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.  I will purchase the neck cream again though.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I wear it alone or under my makeup everyday and would never ever leave the house without it!!</li>
    <li> Worn this moisturizer for years. Love it.</li>
    <li> great product and great price</li>
    <li> Very soft , I like it</li>
    <li> The product came exactly as expected. I love how it just disappears into my skin with no oily residue. I think I will have to use it over time to notice any marked changes, but so far it is promising.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for quite sometime.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! I am 59 years old, have very very dry &amp;#34;Irish&amp;#34; skin. Ounce of gold plumps out A LOT of the fine lines. Worked better than I expected after trying so many other &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; creams. I won&#x27;t go a day without it! I have sensitive skin and had NO adverse reactions whatsoever. This is my first time trying Signature Club A products and I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> love this product..great moisture and full spf---great base for make up---or nothing---gives skin a glow.</li>
    <li> great stuff a little greasy right after application but this is my second purchase so I could get past that.</li>
    <li> the other jar that I ordered at the same time the night cream../was in a larger jar and for less....Why?  not as good of a buy as the&lt;br /&gt;night cream----</li>
    <li> I love all the products from Signature A, especially this one...it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item along with a skin care kit, therefore, it was alot less than the individual price.  I love this product and would purchase it again but with a kit, it&#x27;s only about $10.  This is a silky cream, not oily, that actually has \\&quot;gold\\&quot; shimmer in it.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any long-term plumping but I think because it is so hydrating, it does make your face look plumped, hydrated and brighter.  I use this alone when I don&#x27;t wear foundation, only a bit of powder.  But I especially love this for my under eyes.  Caution-don&#x27;t use too much or get too close to the lower lashes because it does irritate even if it&#x27;s close to your eyes.  This is one of those creams that doesn&#x27;t cake under eye makeup and gives a shimmer to hide dark circles.  If you have thin skin or dark circles under your eyes, this will work great.  I haven&#x27;t found a cream anything like this for my dark circles.  Remember don&#x27;t use too much or too close to the eye.</li>
    <li> the product did not do anything for my skin - it was too oily</li>
    <li> This Moisturizing cream is the best. It makes my skin so soft and I&#x27;ve had so many compliments from other people, on how young my skin looks.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff..really helps my 67 year old skin...helps to diminish lines and a beautiful glow...not shine.</li>
