      <li>The person that I got this for just informed me today that at first she loved it ---</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny!!</li>

      <li>Although, the price was cheap the ad should of stated that the item was used and in what condition it was in.</li>
      <li>LIKE CHEAP PLASTIC</li>
      <li>gave it two stars because it was great at one point when it actually worked.</li>
      <li>although not too happy with the overall outcome, the refund was taken care of a in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>But so far it looks good.  </li>
      <li>If appearance matters, than so far so good.  </li>
      <li>It was a great flat iron until then.</li>
      <li>We bought this flat iron because of its name and its great price.  </li>
      <li>The iron did not close all the way, it felt cheaper than the real chi, and it did not have the authentic chi label inside by the on-off switch.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know what else to say, other than it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>If you want a good flat iron, skip this one!</li>
      <li>IT DOES NOT GET AS HOT!</li>
      <li>I bought this hair straightner and as soon as I opened it from packaging I plugged it in and work just fine then about 2 minutes later it turned off and haven&#x27;t been able to get it working since then.</li>
      <li>It works amazing on different types of hair.</li>
      <li>When I got it and compared it to my own, it did not look or feel the same.</li>
      <li>I thought at the time but was well worth it.</li>
      <li>Other than that there are no complaints and it works good.</li>
      <li>I beleive this is the right model.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased that the iron was sent sooner than expected.</li>
      <li>I have gone through many different hair straightener name brands, and nothing compares to the CHI.</li>
      <li>This item broke During first use.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I would not purchase this if you are looking for the real thing!</li>
      <li>The first on lasted about four years.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s so hot that my hair has burnt.  </li>
      <li>I am definitely dissapointed and do not recommend this seller unless they give more details on the product.</li>
      <li>FIRST OFF I HAVE OWNED A CHI IRON BEFORE</li>
      <li>I bought this product a few months ago and loved it.</li>
      <li>My sister uses hers everyday and has convinced our mother that it will do good for her.  </li>
      <li>I was very excited about this flat iron and the one time I used it</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a real chi either.</li>
      <li>She wants one just for her and one exactly like my sisters.  </li>
      <li>Love my new flat iron.  </li>
      <li>The product seems to work fine and appears to be new but when comparing with the same exact model that was purchased at a Salon I noticed that the one ordered on line does not have the vendor labels so it makes me wonder if it is either a knock off or refurbished product.</li>
      <li>ITS MUCH MUCH LIGHTER.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It worked really well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so glad to find this one for so much less than my first one</li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>so I reordered the same exact model and now this one doesnt work!</li>
      <li>It is nothing like my old one from 2007!!</li>
      <li>BUT NOT LEAST I USED IT 3 TIMES</li>
      <li>First(it was more than 30 days, of course) a plastic round piece come off exposting the wires.  </li>
      <li>I love this product because it really straightens my hair and in less time allowing me to get out earlier.  </li>
      <li>IT DID NOT GET HOT ENOUGH LIKE A CHI IRON.</li>
      <li>My hair is not difficult to straighten, but this flat iron doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything.  </li>
      <li>Where past straighteners I have owned had a blinking light while it was heating up, and stopped blinking when it was ready to use.</li>
      <li>I now need to deal with Amazon directly.</li>
      <li>Everything looks real but the letters on the chi wiped off the second day of use.</li>
      <li>Do not buy--you can get a real one at Ulta for about the same price when they run the 20% off coupon anyway.  </li>
      <li>the old saying, \\&quot;You get what you pay</li>
      <li>I had the box from my old straightener</li>
      <li>I heard all good things about this product and that&#x27;s why I decided to purchase it, but unfortunately for me it doesn&#x27;t work for me like I thought it would</li>
      <li>This iron does not heat up and get as hot as it should therefore it does not work as well as I expected from the CHI name.</li>
      <li>We don&#x27;t recommend this flat iron because it does not get hot enough.  </li>
      <li>and now I have to purchase a new hair straightener again and wait for the refund from Amazon, as the seller is refusing to give me back my money.</li>
      <li>The only thing that could possibly be \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; with the CHI is that it does not show any sign of being ready to use.</li>
      <li>I purchased this \\&quot;CHI\\&quot; from this seller for my mom last Christmas--I didn&#x27;t really inspect the iron when I gave it to her last year and this year I went to her house for the holiday</li>
      <li>(not sure if this proves it&#x27;s used or not).  </li>

<li> It straightens my hair which is thick and kinky and unruly and it stays straight until I get it wet!</li>
<li> The product was just what I expected and was half the cost of buying in a local store!</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> My $15 flat iron from Walmart worked better then this crap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the second flat iron like this I have owned. The first on lasted about four years. It was expensive I thought at the time but was well worth it. I was so glad to find this one for so much less than my first one and it is working great also.</li>
    <li> This straightner is HORRIBLE. Some days it turns on, most days it doesn&#x27;t. I plug it it, turn the button on, and nothing happens. I was so frustrated that I tried contacting the seller to see if they would replace it, but they never replied back. Do NOT buy this straightner.</li>
    <li> BEWARE - This item broke During first use. Maybe it was a lemon (someoned had a bad day on the assembly line?). But, I would double check the return policy before buying this. Amazon has agreed to refund after a few weeks of trying to contact and resolve. But, still waiting. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Chi hair straightener and I never received it! The seller was not at all helpful and would not give me back my money. I now need to deal with Amazon directly. It&#x27;s so frustrating and now I have to purchase a new hair straightener again and wait for the refund from Amazon, as the seller is refusing to give me back my money.</li>
    <li> This product came to me very quickly - was very pleased with the CHI - works Great! No problems at all! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The product seems to work fine and appears to be new but when comparing with the same exact model that was purchased at a Salon I noticed that the one ordered on line does not have the vendor labels so it makes me wonder if it is either a knock off or refurbished product.

    <li> I have gone through many different hair straightener name brands, and nothing compares to the CHI. It heats up fast and straightens hair in half the time every other brand has taken. The only thing that could possibly be \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; with the CHI is that it does not show any sign of being ready to use. Where past straighteners I have owned had a blinking light while it was heating up, and stopped blinking when it was ready to use. I love my CHI and would highly recommend this item to anyone searching for that perfect straightener because it is inexpensive and well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Just letting u guys know that this is a fake chi. Everything looks real but the letters on the chi wiped off the second day of use. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a real chi either.</li>
    <li> I just bought the CHI straightner and it looks extremely worn. Although, the price was cheap the ad should of stated that the item was used and in what condition it was in. I constantly have to figit with the cord for it to stay on as I am straightening my hair. I am definitely dissapointed and do not recommend this seller unless they give more details on the product.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this flat iron and the one time I used it it was wonderful. But after that it never turned on again. For $70 it should work forever.  My $15 flat iron from Walmart worked better then this crap. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the CHI products and was happy to find the product on-line at a reduced price. However, the product only stayed working for 6 weeks. This was a huge disappointment and I was unable to get the product replaced. [[ASIN:B002TBCCR2 Ceramic Hairstyling Iron [Misc.]]]</li>
    <li> I was very pleased that the iron was sent sooner than expected. It appeared to be packed well. I was not entirely happy with this iron. My daughter has an identical one and I love hers, thats why I ordered one for myself. This iron does not heat up and get as hot as it should therefore it does not work as well as I expected from the CHI name.</li>
    <li> I guess, i am the only one who had bad experience with this product:(    I bought this item in March, shipping  service was outstanding, but not the product.    Unfortunately, my straightening Iron worked only 3 months. The day i bought it, i had to reset it all the time. I could not understand the reason for that, and then it stopped working.    My last CHI product worked for 3 yrs not 3 months:(    When i requested seller for refund or replacement, my request was denied stating that management policy has changed.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product zero stars.  I bought two and they both stopped working.  I&#x27;m going to try to return both, but I&#x27;d prefer a refund because there&#x27;s no way I can trust the product.</li>
    <li> The product was just what I expected and was half the cost of buying in a local store! The product also came in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> This too is meant for a xmas gift, so it hasn&#x27;t been used yet.  My sister uses hers everyday and has convinced our mother that it will do good for her.  So now my mother is addicted.  She wants one just for her and one exactly like my sisters.  I beleive this is the right model.  I truly hope it works.  I used a vendor that was \\&quot;just launched\\&quot; so I am unsure about quality and authenticity.  But so far it looks good.  I also hope that the claim that this item is \\&quot;new\\&quot; is correct, and that I am not getting a used product.  I won&#x27;t know before christmas if this item will work or not, but from the looks of it, it seems to be the one that is adored by my family.  One complaint.  I bought my sisters one as well, and hers came with a thermal mat.  This one however did not.  (not sure if this proves it&#x27;s used or not).  So I have to find one and purchase it before christmas.  If appearance matters, than so far so good.  I will update more after the holidays to see if the item is as it is described!</li>
    <li> I heard all good things about this product and that&#x27;s why I decided to purchase it, but unfortunately for me it doesn&#x27;t work for me like I thought it would, that&#x27;s not to say the product isn&#x27;t good, but I would have prefered a product with heat settings, this product doesn&#x27;t have any and I&#x27;m sorry to say, it&#x27;s so hot that my hair has burnt.  I would have returned it, but I misplaced my reciept.    Thank you for this opportunity    Sincerely  Clara</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightner and as soon as I opened it from packaging I plugged it in and work just fine then about 2 minutes later it turned off and haven&#x27;t been able to get it working since then. I had the same straightner before this for 5 years and the button recently broke off so I reordered the same exact model and now this one doesnt work! I&#x27;m disapointed in the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron b/c it was the same one the stylist at the salon used on my daughters hair.  Her hair is a little hard to manage at times.  It takes all the effort out of straightening.  It works amazing &amp; I was extremely happy with the price.  It is worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> This is not a real chi! I have had the same ceramic chi hair straightener for five years and once mine broke, I decided to try to order a discounted one. When I got it and compared it to my own, it did not look or feel the same. The iron did not close all the way, it felt cheaper than the real chi, and it did not have the authentic chi label inside by the on-off switch. I would not purchase this if you are looking for the real thing!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite straightner and I will never go away from CHI. It works amazing on different types of hair. Shipped in an okay time manner - but works wonderfully and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas and it broke within 4 weeks.  Unfortunately we had thrown away the box so we are not able to return it.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron.  Price was greaty, got fast and works awesome.      Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this March 13th and it died two days ago! There is clearly a short in the wiring. :-( It was a great flat iron until then. I will buy from a store next time!</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING CHI FLATIRON FOR ALMOST 8 YEARS AND IVE PURCHASED 2 FROM JC PENNY THIS BEING THE 3RD ONE. THE MINUTE I OPENED IT AND PICKED IT UP I NOTICED IT FELT LIKE CHEAP PLASTIC AND I COMPARED IT TO MY LAST ONE AND ITS MUCH MUCH LIGHTER. IT DOES NOT GET AS HOT! IM RETURNING IT!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> Stopped working a week later</li>
    <li> the product was delivered in great time, as promised, but was defective. although not too happy with the overall outcome, the refund was taken care of a in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best! Granted, they tend to get broken after like 7 years but I&#x27;m on my second and I love love love LOVE it. It straightens my hair which is thick and kinky and unruly and it stays straight until I get it wet! It is simply amazing!</li>
    <li> I got these flat irons and used them ONE time, when I went to use them again they did not work.  Do not buy from this seller!!!</li>
    <li> I love this CHI it is 100% ceramic and is good for my hair. The flat Iron is easy to use and makes my hair look nice, am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months ago and loved it. It worked really well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it in a couple of weeks ago and it would not turn on. I wanted to fix it so I called the CHI number in the user manual and found they could not fix it because it was a counterfeit. I was shocked. I was advised by CHI to contact the seller and warn them they are selling fake CHI&#x27;s (they might not know as packaging looks real) and received no response in the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because it was great at one point when it actually worked. However, it stopped working and was false advertising. If you plan on buying one, make sure it is not a counterfeit when you receive it in the mail.</li>
    <li> I got this iron in March 2012. It is nothing like my old one from 2007!! First(it was more than 30 days, of course) a plastic round piece come off exposting the wires.  Then it shocked me while I was using it because I touched the iron to my back (not the hot part).  Now it won&#x27;t even come on!!!</li>
    <li> We bought this flat iron because of its name and its great price.  I am afraid the old saying, \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot; says it all here.  We don&#x27;t recommend this flat iron because it does not get hot enough.  Because of this, its doesn&#x27;t work as well as our Bed Head brand that we were using.  If you want a good flat iron, skip this one!</li>
    <li> The person that I got this for just informed me today that at first she loved it --- next thing she knew it stopped working --- I wish she would have informed me so I could have returned -- what a waste of money</li>
    <li> I still have not received my product and it is now more then a month since I have purchased the item. I am very angry.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have more thoroughly read the reviews before purchasing.  I agree with other reviewers that this is not a Chi. I bought this a few weeks ago and it doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  My hair is not difficult to straighten, but this flat iron doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything.  Seriously at it&#x27;s hottest I can still touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awful flat iron - I threw away the packaging otherwise I&#x27;d return this.  Looks like it&#x27;s going in the trash.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> FIRST OFF I HAVE OWNED A CHI IRON BEFORE AND I BELIEVE THIS WAS A KNOCK OFF VERISON OF ONE. IT DID NOT GET HOT ENOUGH LIKE A CHI IRON. IT MAKES YOUR HAND HURT TRYING TO HOLD THE PLATES TOGETHER JUST TO GET IT TO STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR AND WHEN YOU GO OUTSIDE ITS ALL OVER HAIR WENT BACK TO FRIZZ. LAST BUT NOT LEAST I USED IT 3 TIMES AND IT HAS A SHORT IN THE CORD WILL NOT STAY ON</li>
    <li> I purchased this \\&quot;CHI\\&quot; from this seller for my mom last Christmas--I didn&#x27;t really inspect the iron when I gave it to her last year and this year I went to her house for the holiday and I couldn&#x27;t believe it--it was obviously a fake.  Do not buy--you can get a real one at Ulta for about the same price when they run the 20% off coupon anyway.  Amazon needs to do a better job of policing these fake products, what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, other than that&#x27;s what the wife says. Don&#x27;t know what else to say, other than it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after one month. Save your money and buy one from a professional hair salon because this one was an imitation. I had the box from my old straightener and it almost looks the same but its not.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it really straightens my hair and in less time allowing me to get out earlier.  Really great product !!!!</li>
