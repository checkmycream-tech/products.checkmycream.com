      <li>Love this mirror.  </li>
      <li>If they could come up with a solution to this problem, I would gladly give this mirror 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Okay, for close-up work like eyes, but a compact mirror with a magnifying mirror on one side, is easier to manage with one hand.</li>

      <li>It would have been fine in the car.</li>
      <li>It &#x27;s fine, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>The 2 elbows adds great versatility in the height and closeness of the mirror, and the standard swivel allows you to easily adjust the angle or switch the faces of the mirror.</li>
      <li>Very compact and comes with it&#x27;s own case.  </li>
      <li>Getting used to magnifier side, but so far so good.  </li>
      <li>High quality, Strong recommendation!</li>
      <li>I keep it at work to use for quick touch ups before I go out after to meet friends.  </li>
      <li>i just bought a second one of these for a second bathroom because it is just perfect.</li>

      <li>Not too powerful that it makes you dizzy.  </li>

      <li>This was exactly what I needed.  </li>

      <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and handy, but it is very thin.</li>
      <li>It folds and unfolds easily, but has enough resistance and &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; to keep it in whatever position you choose.  </li>
      <li>Very sturdy construction.</li>
      <li>I really like this mirror.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d reconsider traveling with this though, unless you pack it carefully with something between the face of the mirror and the folding elbow joint that the mirror will be touching when folded.</li>
      <li>this one is so much nicer  </li>
      <li>It was everything I expected and more.  </li>
      <li>I really like this travel mirror.  </li>
      <li>Very convenient.</li>
      <li>Too heavy for travel but nice on the dressing table.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it, works great!!</li>
    <li> The mirror was the perfect size for travel. Recently took it on vacation. Worked well.</li>
    <li> great.  exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I have had my mirror for years, dragging it out of state and country. Sorry too read of one that broke as mine seems indestructable. Buying one for my sister.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. The 2 elbows adds great versatility in the height and closeness of the mirror, and the standard swivel allows you to easily adjust the angle or switch the faces of the mirror. It&#x27;s small enough to leave on my desk or stow away in my drawer, while the magnification still allows you to see clearly. I&#x27;d reconsider traveling with this though, unless you pack it carefully with something between the face of the mirror and the folding elbow joint that the mirror will be touching when folded. And probably pack it in a way that minimal weight is on the mirror so the mirror won&#x27;t break/crack from the hard metal joints.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this on my dorm desk!  Having a personal mirror is a life savor, otherwise you&#x27;ll spend time tryin to squeeze in at the communal bathroom down the hall.</li>
    <li> It does, indeed, fold up easily and is fairly light and easy to pack.  A winner</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It has great optical clarity and the 7x magnification is perfect for applying makeup!  I just wish I had the option of a lighted mirror.</li>
    <li> This product is great for use of putting on makeup when you are away from home.  You simply put it on a flat surface, adjust it to your comfort, and it stays in place.</li>
    <li> Too heavy for travel but nice on the dressing table.</li>
    <li> nice size has a bag to store</li>
    <li> So far, it has held up well and seems to be well built. Has so many uses and is easy to fold up for traveling,</li>
    <li> Love the mirror.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, and the picture is pretty accurate. The pouch is nice for traveling options. The only thing that would have made this a 5-star product is a thick pouch. It&#x27;s nice and handy, but it is very thin. I still wrap the mirror in a towel before I put it in the pouch just in case. Other than that, the product is worth the price.</li>
    <li> It a mirror it reflects, what else am I forgetting? Sometime I wonder... It &#x27;s fine, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Poorly made. Arrived broken with no damage to the box.</li>
    <li> I really like this travel mirror.  It folds and unfolds easily, but has enough resistance and &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; to keep it in whatever position you choose.  The magnifying side is great for doing close-up makeup application, and the regular side helps you see the back of your hair in the wall mirror.  It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to place it on a bathroom counter, shelf or table to let you see at just the right height.  It comes in a nice drawstring travel bag, as well.  Since I&#x27;m concerned about breakage, I also kept the outer box and used it when packing the mirror in my carry-on.  This is a quality mirror that I plan to use for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for traveling purposes.  I know there were several reviews about it breaking during traveling.  I know it comes with a travel bag  for traveling, but I also kept the box and the piece of card board that was placed between the mirror and the leg that folds under it.  Last cruise I placed the  box in between my clothing in the suitcase and it make it thru being thrown around with all the other luggage just fine.  Very happy I purchased this item it worked out perfect!!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!  I keep it at work to use for quick touch ups before I go out after to meet friends.  The perfect size.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my visits to my son&#x27;s house.  It was inexpensive enough that I could leave it there, and exactly the size and magnification that I need.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and adjusts to any angle required for the light provided.  It folds up so that , if necessary, it could be taken in a suitcase or carry-on.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this mirror.  It can be positioned in many ways, and the joints are stiff enough that it stays in position.  It is not overly large so you could travel with it -- although it seems a little heavy and a mirror is not something I would want to pack, myself -- and it certainly makes it easy to move around the bathroom without fear of clumsily dropping it or banging into something with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror&#x27;s optics are good as well.</li>
    <li> The mirror is exactly what the description claims. It appears to be well made and my daughter loves it. It lost a star because she needed help attaching the mirror to the stand.</li>
    <li> bought this for the bathroom after breaking the hand mirror. I hang it from a towel rack. It&#x27;s nice quality and not expensive. It came with a bag but I tossed it.</li>
    <li> This travel mirror provides quality magnification for putting on makeup.  I had cheaper ones before, where the reflection  was distorted and this one is a big improvement.  It is a little heavier than I was expecting, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I came to realize the 5x Irving Rice travel mirror I&#x27;d gotten for a STEAL on eBay years ago wasn&#x27;t cutting it any more and I needed something with higher magnification. It&#x27;s hard to find a travel mirror with good quality glass at a reasonable price - even harder to find one that &amp;#34;stands up&amp;#34; like this. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> perfect size to take in my suitcase.  recommended</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. I have used the smaller travel mirrors in the past but needed something that stood on its own. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This mirror folds down pretty flat, it seems to be really sturdy, holds at whatever height you put it to &amp; magnifies great.</li>
    <li> Very great mirror and larger than what I expect. 7x is more than I need. High quality, Strong recommendation!</li>
    <li> This is a quality mirror and it gets the job done. I like that it has two sides that shows normal on one side and magnified on the other. This product was worth the money and I received it on the delivery date.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed.  The construction is sturdy and the magnification is great.  It folds down to fit the place I store it and extends to the right height for the place I use it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take the place of a full-sized mirror. The arm is not the easiest to angle without the top-heavy mirror folding over on itself. Okay, for close-up work like eyes, but a compact mirror with a magnifying mirror on one side, is easier to manage with one hand.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase for this mirror. It is made from real metal and bends to any position you could possibly want. It is nice looking and I leave it out on my bathroom counter. I love it. I leave it bent to a lower position  than the picture and it seems to make it more stable.</li>
    <li> Perfect height.  Not too heavy and folds very easily to keep in your drawer or bag.  Mirror is very clear and sharp not like the cheap kind.  Getting used to magnifier side, but so far so good.  Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent - Highly recommend this product.  Very compact and comes with it&#x27;s own case.  Folds up neatly without a lot of hassle</li>
    <li> 7x was way to weak for me. I guess I needed a 10x . The stand is a great design and the way it folds up is nice. Very sturdy construction. I hate to review it bad but I just ordered too weak a magnification. My mistake&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you know the magnification you need before ordering</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror. The stand with two hinges allows for a large variety of angles, making it perfect for many different situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite near-sighted and tend to use the 7x magnification a lot when applying makeup - it works great. Moreover, this mirror&#x27;s &#x27;swing&#x27; hinges are tight enough to where it rests in any position I am putting it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for a somewhat reluctant 1-star deduction is the mirror&#x27;s inherent bulk when using it for travel. Other reviewers have stated that the included pouch does not provide much protection, and they are right. I have decided to keep all the original packaging (a sort of ever so slightly padded ,protective plastic bag as well as a piece of cardboard to put between the folded up stand and the mirror to prevent the stand to put pressure on the mirror). This works but as stated above, it adds unnecessary bulk. If they could come up with a solution to this problem, I would gladly give this mirror 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for my daughter; large enough to use for makeup, but small enough/compact when folded for travel. She loved it.  Arrived before expected and well packed.</li>
    <li> Good quality. I&#x27;ve used it myself a couple times.</li>
    <li> i just bought a second one of these for a second bathroom because it is just perfect. Best of all is the way it folds up for travel (with a felt pouch for protection), yet if you just want it on your dresser to use, it stands up as shown in the photo, and looks good. Great price, perfectly functional, sturdy, good looking (does not look cheap!).  A find!</li>
    <li> I sent this mirror back because it was too heavy to carry in airplane luggage.  It would have been fine in the car.</li>
    <li> I had a travel mirror for about 12 years but it fell apart..this one is so much nicer  and I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time...it is made better!</li>
    <li> I took this an a recent trip. Great for traveling. Not too heavy and just the right magnification for me when doing my eye makeup. Just put it in my carry on with the box it came in since it was well protected. Put it on the bedside table at the hotel. Very convenient. It is fairly sturdy and I didn&#x27;t worry about it falling over.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. packs easily since folds down. good value for the money. plus comes with cloth case. nice</li>
    <li> This is a nice mirror, unfortunately mine arrived defective, one of the metal &amp;#34;thingies&amp;#34; was not attached to the mirror it was loose in the bag!! it would have to be welded back on in order to fix it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD QUALITY,GOOD PRICE, GOOD SHIPPING</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror--for my desk. It is heavy and, even folded, it&#x27;s bulky. I like the mirror; it&#x27;s very sturdy and completely adjustable. Just not a good fit for my travel.</li>
    <li> It is a good product and is function well. It is exactly as the website described. It is a little bit heavier than a expected because it is not a really big mirror. But all in all, it is useful to me. If it could be cheaper, I probably would give it a five star.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed..I like that it stands up without slipping</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  It&#x27;s sturdy and just the perfect magnification.  Not too powerful that it makes you dizzy.  I love how it folds up for travel.  Also, it&#x27;s great because you can position to fit your needs.  Its about the size of a standard table mirror which is perfect.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is in a dorm room &amp; this has been the perfect size for her; thank you!</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected and more.  So easy to use and I took it on my last trip and it was great to pack and to use away from home.</li>
    <li> The product I received looks nothing like what is pictured. It does not have the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; section and this greatly limits its functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The incorrect model mirror was replaced with the correct one at no charge. If this mirror fits your needs it&#x27;s a very good product at a fair price.</li>
