      <li>good value for the price.  </li>
      <li>Stay healthy!</li>
      <li>they are not as nice as the ones I have purchased in a store</li>
      <li>The shape is good for the many contours of the face.  </li>
      <li>The size is perfect for the face and the fact that they are also latex free is fabulous as some people have a reaction to it.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product for its quality, flawless job and unbeatable price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I can easily get even coatings with these and blend make up well!...</li>
      <li>highly recommend these - I love them and they work perfectly !  :)</li>
      <li>They are cushy with just the right amount of absorption to facilitate smooth application of all your cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
      <li>use these mostly for stage make up (that includes using street make up on stage as well as</li>
      <li>I have too many allergies to list</li>
      <li>I am ordering four more bags.</li>
      <li>I love these wedges and my neighborhood chain store stopped carrying them.  </li>
      <li>These wedges are not made of the smooth foam that most others are.  </li>
      <li>Price is good; shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>They are comfortable, soft and very effective as a tool for applying make-up.</li>
      <li>Does not give a smooth finish, but a grainy streaky one.</li>
      <li>Primarily, I use them for applying a liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>They leave a smooth finish.  </li>
      <li>These are a fantastic deal.</li>
      <li>They are soft and have good absorption.</li>
      <li>My other wedges I buy locally do a great job at blending.</li>
      <li>you are looking for the BEST BUDGET FRIENDLY WEDGE, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
      <li>but then again I pay 5 times as much as this one - definately worth purchasing!</li>
      <li>Works great for less important stuff like manicure gradients where you can keep fixing stuff, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for facial makeup.</li>
      <li>After getting my basic beauty supplies (i.e. wedges, brushes, etc.) from Duane Reade stores and the like, I started searching for a more affordable, yet of quality a product on</li>
      <li>These cosmetic wedges are extremely soft and my foundation appears to smooth over my skin very well.  </li>
      <li>and I really like them.</li>
      <li>I should have known better since they cost so little.  </li>
      <li>At this time, I can&#x27;t honestly say that the rather high price is worth the extra, compared to the other ones I would use from my local store.</li>
      <li>I also had to use way more foundation than usual because the wedge soaked so much up.</li>
      <li>They are very porous, so you end up with more foundation coming through the other side to your finger than ends up on your face, and that porous texture gives splotchy results rather than properly smoothing the makeup.</li>
      <li>They are a little light and small, but good enough for applications.</li>
      <li>I re-ordered the large size wedges and received the smaller ones instead.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had experience with various brands of applicator sponges and learned fast that not all are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am sure they would stand up to a few uses if you wanted to use them just on yourself, but for clients, I only use one time then toss them between clients.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really smell it in the bag of the unused wedges, just once the wedge is wet with foundation.</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll try to get it wet first and see if that helps.</li>

<li> /&gt;They feel supple - not stiff and dry like other sponges that consequently apply make up in streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> These are far too small to use on a regular basis for makeup application.</li>
<li> The material was not soft and it ended up making the makeup look streaked.</li>
<li> The only downside is that they have a slight off scent to them that I think is present regardless of what seller they come from.  </li>
<li> These are nowhere near as dense as the wedges I usually buy.</li>
<li> Where I live, these are hard to get.</li>
<li> both with street and stage make up - stage make up is heavier and doesn&#x27;t break down this sponge, so I can put it in a baggie and save for the actor and re use again, the next day, if I&#x27;m running low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> When I finally queried amazon.com I found them in bags if 100 for about 75% less than I was paying for bags of 20.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve previously reviewed this item that I can&#x27;t locate locally.  </li>
<li> These were way too rough for makeup application.</li>
<li> Be careful -</li>
<li> These are standard issue cosmetic wedges- being used for collectible realistic vinyl doll painting.  </li>
<li> you are allergic to latex and/or other chemical components of beauty products, BUY THESE.</li>

<li> They are a bit thin and the small amount of foundation that I applied to the wedge ended up on my fingers on the other side.</li>
<li> With one use, I already had pieces of it breaking off leaving little pieces of the wedge behind on my face.</li>
<li> The other problem I noticed is when they get wet, they have a terrible smell!</li>
<li> These were terrible and left my foundation streaky.</li>

    <li> I have been using Wonder Wedges for months now and I really like them. The only downside is that they have a slight off scent to them that I think is present regardless of what seller they come from.  Otherwise, they absorb and blend makeup well.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I especially like the fact that they come in a pack of 100.  Now I don&#x27;t have to run to the store as often.  Good quality!  Don&#x27;t break apart.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are far too small to use on a regular basis for makeup application. At best used for touch ups.</li>
    <li> Dear Readers, Please discount the \\&quot;one star\\&quot; review accordingly. Shipping the wrong item is a VENDOR problem, not a PRODUCT problem. I have been using these for over a year since I got weary of the constant product/formula changes in the big box stores AND the silly strategy of decreasing units while raising prices on everything sold over the counter is America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are allergic to latex and/or other chemical components of beauty products, BUY THESE. I have too many allergies to list and I can tell you that these do NOT PROVOKE any reactions from my system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the BEST SPONGE APPLICATOR, even if you are NOT allergic to ingredients, BUY THESE! They are cushy with just the right amount of absorption to facilitate smooth application of all your cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the BEST BUDGET FRIENDLY WEDGE, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these. You pay $3+ for 6 applicators in the store. You pay $12 for 100 wedges here. BUY THESE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks all! Stay healthy!</li>
    <li> After getting my basic beauty supplies (i.e. wedges, brushes, etc.) from Duane Reade stores and the like, I started searching for a more affordable, yet of quality a product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WONDER WEDGES made it perfectly. They are comfortable, soft and very effective as a tool for applying make-up. Primarily, I use them for applying a liquid foundation. They work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for its quality, flawless job and unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> I just used these tonight to do ombre cots with three different colors I wish I could show u it&#x27;s not just for makeup it&#x27;s a mix of things to do with them I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve previously reviewed this item that I can&#x27;t locate locally.  The size is ideal for one time application of any product for the face.  They leave a smooth finish.  The shape is good for the many contours of the face.  I hope their availability will continue.</li>
    <li> These were way too rough for makeup application.</li>
    <li> These are nowhere near as dense as the wedges I usually buy. They are very thin, flimsy, and porous. I use them to blend my foundation. My other wedges I buy locally do a great job at blending. These were terrible and left my foundation streaky. I also had to use way more foundation than usual because the wedge soaked so much up. Next time I&#x27;ll try to get it wet first and see if that helps. With one use, I already had pieces of it breaking off leaving little pieces of the wedge behind on my face. The other problem I noticed is when they get wet, they have a terrible smell! I can&#x27;t really smell it in the bag of the unused wedges, just once the wedge is wet with foundation. I won&#x27;t be buying these again and will probably put them in with my kids art stuff to be used to for crafts.</li>
    <li> Be careful - I re-ordered the large size wedges and received the smaller ones instead.  Did not realize until I opened the package and will use them anyway.  Just an inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Where I live, these are hard to get. They are a little light and small, but good enough for applications. And you throw them out anyway. Price is good; shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Terrible material. Does not give a smooth finish, but a grainy streaky one. Wouldnt recomend it for use with makeup.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for them. They are a bit thin and the small amount of foundation that I applied to the wedge ended up on my fingers on the other side. The material was not soft and it ended up making the makeup look streaked.</li>
    <li> These are standard issue cosmetic wedges- being used for collectible realistic vinyl doll painting.  The price is OK… having them delivered to my door is the big perk.  These work for my purposes.</li>
    <li> Works great for less important stuff like manicure gradients where you can keep fixing stuff, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for facial makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had experience with various brands of applicator sponges and learned fast that not all are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these mostly for stage make up (that includes using street make up on stage as well as the heavy, horrible stage make up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges apply both PERFECTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel supple - not stiff and dry like other sponges that consequently apply make up in streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can easily get even coatings with these and blend make up well!... both with street and stage make up - stage make up is heavier and doesn&#x27;t break down this sponge, so I can put it in a baggie and save for the actor and re use again, the next day, if I&#x27;m running low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these - I love them and they work perfectly !  :)</li>

    <li> good value for the price.  they are not as nice as the ones I have purchased in a store but then again I pay 5 times as much as this one - definately worth purchasing!</li>
    <li> This product is very low quality.  It leaves clumps on the skin, thus not spreading evenly.  I will not order these again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother. Not the silky sponge you think it is.</li>
    <li> These are a fantastic deal. I decided to do makeup on other people. They are soft and have good absorption. The size is perfect for the face and the fact that they are also latex free is fabulous as some people have a reaction to it. I got these for my makeup class so I could toss them after each use to avoid contamination between people. I am sure they would stand up to a few uses if you wanted to use them just on yourself, but for clients, I only use one time then toss them between clients. For myself I use the [[ASIN:B000I5HJ2Y Beautyblender, The Ultimate Makeup Sponge Applicator, 2 sponges.]] but for a disposable sponges these can not be beat especially when you consider the low price. I am ordering four more bags.</li>
    <li> These are the worst quality makeup wedges I have ever used. They are so flimsy and porous. Terrible. Amazong shouldn&#x27;t be selling these.</li>
    <li> These cosmetic wedges are extremely soft and my foundation appears to smooth over my skin very well.  At this time, I can&#x27;t honestly say that the rather high price is worth the extra, compared to the other ones I would use from my local store.</li>
    <li> I love these wedges and my neighborhood chain store stopped carrying them.  When I finally queried amazon.com I found them in bags if 100 for about 75% less than I was paying for bags of 20.  So happy!!</li>
