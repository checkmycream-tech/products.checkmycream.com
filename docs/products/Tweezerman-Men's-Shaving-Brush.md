<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> does not shed like the drug store cheap ones.  I do hang it in a brush holder so the handle doesn&#x27;t rot.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush about a month ago and use it regularly.  Overall it is an OK brush given the price (brushes can go over $100).  I expected the brush to lose some hairs for the first 10 shaves or so, but this one seems to constantly lose hairs.  It is still very usable - but I worry if within the next few months it may become too depleted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow - I use the brush with Proraso Shaving Soap.  It makes a nice lather to then shave with a DE razor.  When creating the lather, I only use the tips of the brush, so no hard pushing to overuse and wear it out sooner than it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I give this 3 stars.  If it does lose too many hairs, I will try a different brush my next time around.</li>
    <li> I received a tweezerman brush several years ago as a gift, and enjoyed it for its stiff bristles.  I recently order another, and was disappointed that the bristles are limp and the brush was not as thick.</li>
    <li> softest brush i have owned and it holds up well to regular use. Creates a nice smooth consistent lather every time!!!</li>
    <li> So I bought this on price.  Just doesn&#x27;t hold up.  I&#x27;ve used this brush for a couple months and STILL sheds.  This is a good emergency brush or travel brush.  Not made for daily shaving.</li>
    <li> Product brush has an absolutely horrible gamey smell.  I cannot even put it near my face.  Disgusting.  I kept it in a drawer in the package for too long to be able to return it.</li>
    <li> The bristles fall out</li>
    <li> I liked it better than the cheap Escali one I subsequently got off of amazon, despite the latter being badger bristle and this one being boar.</li>
    <li> It is a nice brush but I feel that it has started losing hairs too soon. Four more words required.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because it reminded me of my dad&#x27;s shaving brush when I was a little girl. I can remember rubbing his brush all over my face. While this brush isn&#x27;t as soft as my dads yet it&#x27;s a well mad brush and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> If you just want to make good lather and not spend a fortune, this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can make lather as thick as I want with this.</li>
    <li> Was surprised by the number of bristles that were lost the first time I used the brush.  Since then not many.  Feels very soft.  Have no experience with other brushes with which to compare, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Working well after 6 months, no bristles falling out, so far, so good.  Initially, it had  a bit of an odd smell.&lt;br /&gt;but that seems to have dissipated.</li>
    <li> Been using this brush for 4 years now (off and on), it has held up well and creates great lather with both soaps and creams.</li>
    <li> The bristles are firm and feel nice when applying shaving cream.  Much better than my previous brush and looks nice too.</li>
    <li> evenly distributed the lathered on my face without loosing bristles.  the bristles are soft against skin and fits easily into my hand.</li>
    <li> It works for its main purpose of building up a froth and applying it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it&#x27;s still losing five or more hairs, every use. I&#x27;ve used the brush 3+ times a week for the last 2 months and treat it as it should (wash after use, gently squeeze out water, light shake, and hang dry). I got my money&#x27;s worth, but it isn&#x27;t stellar.</li>
    <li> The hairs fall out more than I would like. Other than that its a great badger brush. It coats nicely.</li>
    <li> One of the best brushes in the price range.  Great for a beginner, travel, or every day use.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend over $100 on a big lofty badger, this one does the job for around $12.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for nearly a year, it goes very well with the shaving soap I bought from the same vendor last xmas and is still going strong after a year, of daily use. will be using this vendor again</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush now for about 2 months.  On average I shave 2-3 times per week.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this product and would recommend it to anyone.  This is the first shaving brush I have ever owned and it is a great introduction.  It is affordable and durable.  There is barely any sign of use.  As with any kind of product like this it is important that you take the time to learn proper care for it to last.  If you do that I have no doubt that this brush will last a good long time for anyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little stiff until you break it in. I just broke it in by usage as opposed to the normal method. Doesn&#x27;t lose hairs like the other brush I got in a set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my bother.</li>
    <li> I picked this up based on reviews and price.  My first use had about 10 hairs fall out of the brush.  This is a nice investment to see if you like the manual razor experience is for you.  I am going to make an investment on a brush that will have more longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very functional and does the job, it just loses too many bristles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for more than three years now.  I decided to upgrade from my cheap Omega silk (seta) brush [[ASIN:B000JXY8MO Omega 46065 Shaving Set with Brush, Holder, and Soap in Bowl]] with this Tweezerman badger brush.  The Tweezerman is coarse on my face and shed like crazy on the very FIRST use as well as subsequent uses.  I know how to use and care for a brush, and this one is a real disappointment.  Even when I first started wet shaving using the Omega silk brush, before knowing how to care for it, the Omega seldom shed more than a hair or two every now and then.  Maybe I just got a bad unit from Tweezerman, but even if that&#x27;s the case, it speaks to poor quality control.  I would pass on this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush now for quite a few weeks. I am very pleased at the quality and quantity of lather produced. There were quite a few hairs shed early on, but that seems to have stopped now. For the price, this simply cannot be beaten. It&#x27;s now my every day brush.</li>
    <li> the first few days there will probably be some loss of the hair.  perhaps 3 or 4 shaves at most.&lt;br /&gt;then it is great - I have it almost a month.</li>
    <li> this brush is extremely worth the money by far,some bristles come off in my first shave but not my second,and it was only like 3 so it wasn&#x27;t that bad.Bottom line if all the bristles fall out im buying the same one again.Well worth the money</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Quality is great and at a great price. I&#x27;ve seen brushed in stores for 3x the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as a replacement for another, that I can&#x27;t seem to find, after I moved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other Tweezerman products and they seem to be fairly high quality products.  This brush is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a badger brush with a wooden handle.  The bristles are about 2 inches long and the width is approximately 2 1/2 inches at its widest.  It is not a really soft brush, I would say more like a medium texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use, the brush is able to be wetted and hold water quite well.  I&#x27;m able to work up a lather in a short time.  On average it loses about four - five bristles per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is clean rinsing and dries well if you hang it upside down or lay it on its side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even for a budget brush I would not hesitate to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/17/2010:  This brush is still going strong after 1 year of shaving. I have a brush stand that I use to let it dry upside down.  All of the bristles are still there, and the handle looks like new!</li>
    <li> Update 2014&lt;br /&gt;It has been about 5 years since I purchased this brush, and it is still going strong.  I use it every day.  Well worth the $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review 2009&lt;br /&gt;To get a 100% badger brush for 10 dollars is a steal.  It&#x27;s not high quality badger hair, but its still a very nice brush for the price.  No problems so far.  Hair loss on the brush is minimal.  Just store properly (Bristles facing down) and take care of it and your 10 dollar investment will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Mine was made with inferior glue.....a bristle came loose every time I used it, now ( after 5 months use)  the entire bristle pack popped out of the handle.....the wood is cracked!  It was nice to look at, and worked OK.  These are hand assembled, you might get a good one.  I will probably epoxy it back together and get some more use out of it.  My last cheap, plastic mass produced shave brush lasted 15 years and never lost bristles, they just wore down to nubs!</li>
    <li> No \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; so far.  Only brush I&#x27;ve ever tried, for $ I&#x27;m satisfied.  Holds enough water to get a good lather going.    update:  @12 shaves lost first hair, but is holding up since.  expecting to get at least 6-9 months out of the brush, with almost daily usage.  time will tell.</li>
    <li> This brush is one of the cheaper ones that I have seen in the market. I have been using it for a few months. I like it mostly. Initially, I thought a lot of hairs separated from the brush, but that has slowed down now. It DOES hold more moisture and lather than a synthetic hair brush, but could hold much more.  Buy it if you want a cheaper version of the badger brush OR are just starting out on the \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; double-edge shaving approach. Otherwise, if you consider yourself to be an expert, buy a better one</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving, so I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much initially.  Along with my Merkur razor, I purchased the Tweezerman Brush, and I&#x27;m impressed with its quality.  Badger hair brushes can, apparently, cost well into the hundreds of dollars, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for 15 bucks, but this is a good little brush.  I get a good lather for my shaves and the badger hairs stay in place, for the most part.  The only thing missing is a stand, which would really come in handy for drying, but for $15, you couldn&#x27;t really ask for more!</li>
    <li> The brush is excellent and works quite well.  It would fit my hand better if the handle was a little longer, but it was an excellent buy for the price.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the brushes - I bought two.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great brush for new wetshavers to get themselves started.  It&#x27;s cheap but it performs well considering it&#x27;s price.  My only complaint is it seems fragile.  When I first ordered the brush, it was sent to me cracked, but was replaced immediately once I contacted the vendor.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush at a price that seems cheap by comparison to other brushes. I read reviews that questioned the product&#x27;s durability. The key is to rinse  well, shake  as dry as you can and store bristle-side down. It seems to work.     There are numerous  shaving enthusiasts and like all enthusiasms, the opportunities to spend money are endless. This is a economical way to experience wet shaving. You can always spend more...but do it later.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush and would recommend it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now.  It provides a firm but soft application on the face and lathers up very well.  I do find that it holds lather and water much better than the cheap one I bought at the grocery store.  It did smell slightly at first but I just rinsed it out with cold water a couple of times and let it air out on its side.  The smell went away.  I have lost very, very few bristles on this brush.  I clean it out with cold water after each shave, shake it out well and store it on its side.  I&#x27;m quite happy with this purchase and would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few weeks ago along with a safety razor, soap dish, blades, and razor and brush stand.  The bristles are thick but not stiff and it seems to exfoliate (not a word I typically use) the skin well; which I think is the point of using badger hair.  Will edit if there is any problems with it later.</li>
    <li> Does the job it is designed to do but it sure does stink for about a month&#x27;s worth of use.  Good price!  3/13/2013 UPDATE:  Still going strong after two years.  Smell finally disappeared.  Can only state what another reviwer said: Hhang it so the bristles are facing down so it can dry properly.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are all trimmed off bluntly leaving an irritating end on them. It actually hurts the face to use it.  Have used boars bristle brushes that were more comfortable on the face. You get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
    <li> this is the perfect brush for someone who&#x27;s just started out using one. the bristles feel great, it lathers up shaving soaps really well, and after a few days it stops shedding all together. Would definitely recommend this to anyone, amateur or professional.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to use this brush in your wetshaving starter kit as it won&#x27;t let you down.  It easily creates tons of good lather.  It&#x27;s not a very soft brush, this fact also makes loading from a soap puck easier.  My brush sheds at least 1 hair per use so I don&#x27;t use a lot anymore but it was a great brush to get started with.</li>
    <li> I was cautious because of the low price but I am very pleased.  I got the first close shave in decades without paying someone for it.  As they say smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  I got this with a new safety razor and all.  I forgot how the feeling of that hot brush and soap/cream feels.  I hadn&#x27;t received my oil yet or made any so I had a very small amount irritation also I haven&#x27;t used a safety razor in over 20 years.  There is a tendency to press too hard. It was just right for my face and shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;This is a hell of a good bang for the buck.  I will have to get a razor and brush stand so they will dry correctly but I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I recently converted over from using everything from the generic foams or gels to using shaving soap and a badger brush. Although I can tell you that this method of shaving is far superior; I would stay away from this particular brush.     The set of bristles came off of the wooden base on the first shave. This happened as I was trying to squeeze the soap out of the brush (picture squeezing a tube of toothpaste) on my second pass of shaving. If you do end up buying this product, just hold on to the base of the bristles when you do this and you may be fine. However glue is what holds the bunch of bristles together on the wooden base where I would have preferred more of a mechanical attachment (such as a metal ring with teeth) in addition to the glue.  -Rene N.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush.  Much better than the drug store boars hair brush that was falling apart.  The brush produces a very smooth shaving foam, much less coarse than boars hair.</li>
    <li> Great  brush  for the  correct  application i.e. mixing  the  shave  cream. Use  your  more  expensive  silvertip to apply cream/soap to your  face. Clean the  tweezerman with hair  shampoo and conditioner and  rinse. Leave  the  brush  outside in the  fresh air  for  a few  days. The  badger  odor  will go  away. Great  travel  brush  as  well. Even  the  pros  seem  to have 1  tweezerman in their  collection.</li>
    <li> Sheds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just getting back into wet shaving after not liking electric razors for close to 30 years.  I have a sparse beard so I look better shaven than scraggly.  If the Maynard G. Krebs look is ever in style, I may stop shaving, but for now, I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I figured I&#x27;d start with a bowl, some soap, and a low-price range brush ($60 seems awfully high to me, some of them go to $120- $200 and up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a week.  Every day I would pick loose, shed hairs out of the bowl and off my face and, while shaving, come upon another hair or two in the lather.  Compared to what I bought next (Rooney super silver tip 1/1), this is like&lt;br /&gt;lathering your face with a whisk broom in stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d return it as defective, but it&#x27;s a personal hygiene issue, right?  I&#x27;ll look again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, spend a little more, save some aggravation.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would work fairly well, boy was I wrong.  After three uses the hair separated from the wooden base thanks to the small dabs of hot glue giving way.  I should have returned it before the return policy expired, I hate throwing money away.  I&#x27;ve already hot glues it again and just tonight it fell apart, so into the trash it goes.  Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> good product works great i really like using the \\&quot;old school \\&quot; shaving brush . Im able to shave with the soap doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry brush stays soft.</li>
    <li> Been using this brush for a week now, it is soft as a feather on your face, and holds an amazing amount of shave cream and/or water.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush when I first began DE shaving about 6 months ago and used it for the first 3.5 months.  I never had any problems with the handle.  It&#x27;s still fine.  There was some moderate shedding at the beginning, which is to be expected.  Lathers up ok.  Water retention isn&#x27;t bad either.    The thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s too scratchy, even after having broken in, which didn&#x27;t take long (a few uses).  It&#x27;s not horribly scratchy, but it is enough to where I never use it anymore now that I have a couple of brushes that are better quality (and more expensive - Semogue 1305 boar and Parker Silvertip badger).  Granted, the Tweezerman&#x27;s a cheap badger brush, and if you just have NO money, I suppose it&#x27;s ok... maybe.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, though.  It might be kind of difficult to get better quality than this at its low price, but I think spending a little more on a better brush, even for a beginner, is definitely the way to go.</li>
    <li> I love this brush and have been using it pretty much everyday for two years now. First, if you&#x27;re thinking of switching to a shaving brush, do it for sure! You&#x27;ll never be able to go back to the canned foam or an electric. Second, check out Omega 46001 Shaving Soap in Bowl. It is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So back to the brush. It is well made and fairly inexpensive for what you&#x27;re getting. I do have bristles that are periodically coming out, but I think that&#x27;s to be expected. The important things is how long it has lasted me so far and how great it feels to use. I&#x27;d highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The only thing I can say is buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Makes mountains of lather without effort using less cream/soap. It feels great on your face and is one of the best buys I have made on Amazon.</li>
    <li> You want bang for your buck?  Go ahead and price out badger brushes and then order this one.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  It does lose a bristle or two, occasionally, but if you get the stand and take good care of it, it&#x27;ll serve you well.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for the price.  It smelled a bit like animal, but with a little shampoo, and a couple of uses it wore off.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was a little upset to say that...i pulled it out the package in 2 pieces.  Not enough glue on the brush to keep to the handle.  It was quite an upset to be honest.  But once I krazy glued it in, let it sit it was good to go!  Also, one more thing, CLEAN OUT THE BRUSH. oxyclean. let it sit in soap. ANYTHING. it wreaks of fresh badger! lol</li>
    <li> Arrived without proper gluing which caused it to fall apart in the first shave. Went ahead and glued it myself with some dollar store super glue and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart since. However, due to it&#x27;s original construction it continues to lose hairs and will likely be unusable soon. Should have trusted the other reviews that mentioned the same thing.   For those that will say \\&quot;Did you use a brush holder?\\&quot; - It broke right after I pulled it out of the package for my first shave. Never even had a chance to shave with it before it did.</li>
    <li> This brush was the first one I purchased for my DE shaving setup. It works well and lathers many different soaps and cremes well. I have compared it to a Semogue 1305 and it does out perform it. That might be possibly because the Semogue 1305 has not been broken in yet.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical purchasing this brush due to the inexpensive price. I must say it has greatly surpassed any brush I&#x27;ve eve used, and for a quarter the price! Holds a crazy amount of lather and is every thing you want in a high quality brush. It&#x27;s bristles are soft and the knot is very durable(haven&#x27;t lost a single bristle).My only gripe is I hadn&#x27;t found this deal sooner.</li>
    <li> Upon arrival the brush is much larger than I had anticipated.  During the first use, I did have to pull one or two bristles off my face, but other than that - it exfoliates really well and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. The amount of bristles make the brush very wide and they are almost too firm - but I imagine the more I use it, the more comfortable it will become. All in all, if you&#x27;re looking for a brush that does what it&#x27;s supposed to and you aren&#x27;t incredibly concerned with how fancy it is - this is it! The price it right.</li>
    <li> My brush is still not 100% broke in yet. It does loose a few hairs here and there, but again it is a new brush. It lathers much better than boars hair, and is MUCH nicer to your skin. For the price I think the Tweezerman brush is top notch all the way. Yes you can spend alot more on brushes, and in the future I probably will, but as a beginner to traditional type shaving this brush performs very well</li>
    <li> I shaved using this product twice. I picked it up to begin a shave, and the brush head fell out on the floor. I bought it because of the overwhelming approval of the product.I would not give it One star..beware unless you are ready to return it.It is a poorly glued cheap product...you get what you pay for...check Art of Shaving for the best shave you will ever have, period!No cuts, no burns, nor errors...Shave brush has 4x the thickness of Badger hair! Amazon delivery is the best; check out the product above there also.You won&#x27;t be sorry, because you will make an investment not a throw product in process.</li>
    <li> I am new to using shaving cream brushes. So, I bought this one because it looked well made and was not very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good on my face/beard and seems to do the job with preparing the pores of my face and skin for shaving. It applies the cream evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I used it for the first time, rinsed it and shook it to get the excess water out I notice that several of the badger hairs were loose and fell out. I assume maybe this is because it is a brand new brush and needs to be \\&quot;worked in\\&quot; so to speak, so a few of the hairs came off that were loose to begin witn. I don&#x27;t know if this is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will continue using it and see what happens. I took off two stars becuase I don&#x27;t think this is normal for a shaving cream brush. I will keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PWN</li>
    <li> seems to be stood up ok after a few year or so. Very good brush.</li>
    <li> This was a great badger hair brush. It was fairly priced and of high quality. I suggest washing it out first, not because of the smell but to wash off loose bristles.</li>
    <li> Fantastic item and quick shipping!! It is a very easy and lovely product to use, so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Order one now, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got my hopes up by reading all of the reviews that hyped this up as the best badger brush out there for those of us that don&#x27;t have money trees growing on our property and after opening the brush and using it for the first time agree that it is an amazing value.  It&#x27;s very solidly built like products at 2-3 times the price.  Very few hairs fell out while using it as compared to cheaper ones where you are constantly picking hairs off your face.  I can&#x27;t say how long it will last but if the other reviews are true you should be able to use this for quite some time.  I will definitely buy another and give them for gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after being \\&quot;treated\\&quot; by my family to a more expensive line of \\&quot;art\\&quot;-istic shaving gear (their cheapest brush, the one I have, is $55, and you can spend up to $1200).  I got hooked on the experience of using a brush after years of foams that left me with razor bumps and irritated skin.  The brush isn&#x27;t the singular answer to this problem, but it helps.  I got the \\&quot;Tweezerman\\&quot; based pretty much on price, and that is was a badger hair brush (there is a difference between badger hair and synthetic, for sure).  I wanted to have a brush I could take with me on trips, and leave the other one at home.  This brush is at least as good as the original brush I have.  It holds water well and makes great lather.  Get this one - can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Damn fine brush for a good price. Very functional. Works well under nominal and field conditions. Bristles are just right and work up a good lather. Facilitates a good close shave, even for those with a barbed wire like beard.</li>
    <li> I have been using a mug and brush ever since I was \\&quot;old\\&quot; enough to think shaving everyday was going to be the coolest thing going.  Ever since canned shave cream and electric shavers have made old mug and brush shaving something more nostalgic in nature than a real marketable item, shaving mugs, brushes, and soaps have evolved into something far more often ornate and decorative than useful. There used to be some cheap plastic brushes available in some local drug stores but they are fast drying up.  On the other end, I have seen outrageous prices asked for fancy ones on some places online.  This Tweezerman is all the shaver you will ever need at a very reasonable price.  Its solid wood, and the bristles are big and just the right stiffness.  (Since all brushes get softer over use, its not a good idea to start off with softer ones.) Although all brushes lose some of their bristles during regular use, this brush is losing them at what I would call a very reasonable rate. I don&#x27;t own what Tweezerman refers too as their \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; brush.  However take it from someone that has always shaved with a mug and brush, and can \\&quot;almost\\&quot; remember the time when that was all there was, this is an excellent quality brush which should last you for many years.  Buy two and you will be done for life..... Recommended.</li>
    <li> i had to break down and replace the antique shaving brush that i had of my grandfathers, and i couldn&#x27;t be happier, this is a great brush</li>
    <li> I had a badger brush from the local big box store, thought this one looked a little better.  I was really dissapointed. Doesn&#x27;t look much like the nice rounded brush in the picture, more like one that got a bad haircut.  It was jagged, much smaller brush in proportion to the handle.  And the darn thing is uncomfortable to use - a green scrubby from the kitchen is softer. It is probably the last Tweezerman&#x27;s product I will try.</li>
    <li> This product is poorly constructed. I was squeezing the water out of it and the brush popped out of the base. Invest in a more expensive brush -- it&#x27;ll be worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I wanted to see what the deal was with badger brushes. I used it for a little while and liked it but I will stick with my boar brush.     Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a bad little brush for the price, I just prefer a boar brush because I find them more comfortable. Badger hair is way too soft and it feels more like a mop and less like a brush.     All in all I&#x27;d say badger brushes are over rated. I&#x27;d recommend this product if you want to see what badger brushes are all about but don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a fancy one or if you already like badger brushes but want a cheap one for traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as my introduction to old school shaving. Since I was just getting started, I did not want to spend a fortune for a brush. This one fits the bill. Not expensive and does a good job. It does shed a few hairs each use, but it is still new so I don&#x27;t know if this is a serious problem. Using a brush to apply a good shaving cream is the only way to go. A very enjoyable experience.</li>
    <li> Brush is very good - very few hairs have fallen out.  Price is Xcellent.  I recommend.  If I ever need another brush, I am going to buy this one.  It also has a lifetime guarantee, so I reckon I won&#x27;t even need a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - approx. a year later, no hairs have fallen out at all, and I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving the badger hair. Much better than whatever was in the one I replaced.</li>
    <li> This is my first badger shaving bursh, and I was not expecting much from it. Most other pure badger brushes are priced mush higher, and I could not see how this cheap of a brush would provide good quailty.  Was I ever wrong.  It creats lather quickly.  A little stiff, but is getting softer with each use. It will shed a few hairs, but it is still a well made product.  A little light in the handel, but for the price whose complaining. If you are looking for an inexpensive starter brush, man this is the one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this brush about a month ago and it has held up pretty well.  At $15 it is the best value pure badger brush on the market.  At first it&#x27;s a little stiff.  It loses a few bristles here and there but after a few uses it breaks in.  I haven&#x27;t lost a bristle in weeks and its gotten softer.  Of course there are better best badger brushes and silvertip badger brushes on the market but be prepared to pay $40-200 USD for a quality badger brush.  The Tweezerman makes a good starter brush at $15.  Why even bother to buy a synthetic or boar brush (both don&#x27;t hold water well) when you can get this one for $15?  I plan to upgrade to a better/softer brush down the line but the Tweezerman is treating me well and in the future will make an excellent back up or travel brush.  I recommend this brush for anyone who decides to start traditional wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really complain. It works as advertised. It&#x27;s not as soft as more expensive brushes, but I think it lathers better.</li>
    <li> I just recently got into wet shaving and I bought this brush as my first one. I&#x27;ve gotta say its really nice, its a decent size and it works your cream into a lather quite nicely. My only complaints would be that the bristles could be a bit softer and since it is animal hair it smells a bit funky when you get it wet for the first few times.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaving brush more than 4 years! Badger hair is the only way to go for a great shave, and this brush is constructed with a good grade (research the grades of badger hair used for bristles).    The only issue I&#x27;ve had is the need to dip the handle in polyurethane about a year ago, since then it has been just like new.    Tip: Always store shaving brushes with the bristles down (buy a $2 hanger), this will prevent ongoing loss of bristles.</li>
    <li> I gave this review 4 stars because this is a great investment to make to start off shaving...and much much better than your run of the mill Wal-Mart boar brush.    Knot size will range from 21-23mm after the initial bloom of this brush. If youre looking for a soft badger brush with a featherlight touch...this is not it. But it will get the job done.     This brush holds a decent amount of water, and will create lather pretty easily. Its a bit more difficult if you are using the shaving soap pucks for your shave. I would recommend using a shave creame with this brush. Something not from a aerosol container either...Truefitt &amp; Hill creates a very nice cream.    In closing, get this brush if youre looking for something cheap to practice lathering techniques with. If you have been involved in the world of straight shaving or double edge shaving for awhile...you should already know that youre going to get what your paying for in a 15 dollar badger brush.    Happy shaving everyone</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no reason to spend more for a badger brush.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would buy the brush again. I&#x27;m been using it eveyday and see no issues.  The only thing you need to remember is to wipe down the wooden handle when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> This is my first badger brush, after using a pig brush, and I really like it.  So, I can&#x27;t comment on how it compares to other badgers, but by simple photo comparisons of density, for instance, this brush is a steal.  I&#x27;m pretty hard on stuff, even though I take care of it, and this brush is unphased by the work it does making lather, and lathering my head (I only shave my skull, not my beard) for 3 to 4 passes.  I&#x27;m very happy with this brush:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still new to shaving with shaving soap and brushes, so I looked to a friend with more experience and this was the primary thing he suggested.  I can tell a definite difference between the tweezerman brush and the one I was given initially which is sold in a Walmart.  Both get the job done, but the Tweezerman has been softer on my skin and more durable.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present, but it seems like a great brush at a great price (most are much more expensive). Also, the delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> The brush size is good and I can live with the fact that it stank like a badger out of the package.   But the fact that the brush&#x27;s hair is constantly falling out is rather annoying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to the \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; scene, but I started out with a Boar&#x27;s hair brush.  I did not have much luck, and almost gave up.  So I decided to try this brush, figuring at worst, I&#x27;m only out 13 bucks.  I have not touched the boars hair brush since.  I love this brush!  It feels much better on the face and I can build a much thicker lather with it.  I would highly recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Good brush, it has lasted for a couple years now, but the bristles constantly fall out. It also had a very strong odor every time it got wet for the first few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I bought a Tweezerman shaving brush to replace a boar bristle brush I lost--yes lost.  The Tweezerman does a better job because it&#x27;s more comfortable and because it lathers up faster and thicker.  That said, the differences are minor in respect to the final shave. Both do a good job and the job they both do good is keeping your skin wet while you shave.  The badger bristles have a slight edge in this.  You&#x27;d think keeping skin wet would be easy, but it&#x27;s not.  What lubricates a blade more than anything is the water itself and not what&#x27;s in the soap.  The second you splash water on your skin it immediately begins to evaporate, so by the time you get your razor to your face most of it has evaporated.  The soap foam keeps the water at your skin--that&#x27;s its job here. The best shave doesn&#x27;t need any soap at all.  Shave under a shower with no soap and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. Try it as a test. You&#x27;ll get the closest shave that way.  Do this only if you have memorized where everything is on your face.  Shaving foam does as good a job as a wet brush in my opinion and so I use it more often than not. My final view is that the Tweezerman brush is a great deal and works well.  I can see no reason to buy a more expensive brush--some sell for more than a hundred plus some dollars.  Whatever they add to the mix for this price is probably not worth it.  If you want to impress people with your shaving acumen, learn to use a straight razor--not for wusses or the faint of heart, though.  I have been using the brush for several months and have not had any of the quality issues like shedding bristles that others here have reported, so this experience seems to vary.  There could be some quality control problems at play.  I do make it a point to hang the brush upside-down to dry, though.  Drying it bristle side up might allow water to pool so that the glue holding the bristles is weakened.</li>
    <li> I had to purchase a second one of these to use at work.  Can&#x27;t beat this brush for the low price!</li>
    <li> Wow, what can I say...This is my first badger brush. It works amazing, creates a great lather, has good size and was a fantastic price!  5 Stars!</li>
    <li> This is an all badger brush, and believe me, it smells like it. You get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve previously used a Vulfix brush which costs a couples times more than this, but was well worth it. This brush is barely useable, the hairs are extremely prickly unlike higher quality brushes, and it smells like a dead badger!</li>
    <li> Classic shaving, wet shaving, or whatever you want to call it, is essentially the idea that older style shaving tools and techniques deliver a better shave, a better shaving experience, and/or more economy, than the modern multi-blade cartridge razor and can of shaving cream gives.    Like any other pursuit or hobby, there are those that will approach it from a perspective of frugality, those who&#x27;ll opt for luxury and status, and those who want to hit the sweet spot of performance for the least expense.  The Tweezerman&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush aims for that last group, and hits the mark well.    The whole idea here is that the Tweezerman brush is the least expensive Badger hair brush available new, and badger brushes deliver high quality lather with less time and effort than boar hair or synthetic brushes.    There are certainly badger brushes to be had for several hundred dollars, and they sport a higher quality grade of badger hair, and more of it.  There are cheaper brushes made of lesser material.  With the Tweezerman, you get most of the performance of the luxury brush with a cost more in line with a budget brush of far lower quality.    My Tweezerman performs admirably, shedding few hairs after the first use.  There is little heft to the handle, and there are certainly brushes that are more pleasing to the eye.    If you get the brush acquisition bug, the Tweezerman will become the Yugo in your collection of exotic cars, an object of some scorn.  If you are used to a boar or synthetic brush, the Tweezerman will seem like hot stuff.  If you like nice for less, the Tweezerman is a great buy, and if you treat yourself to a nicer brush later, you&#x27;ll have a handy travel brush in the Tweezerman.    This little brush has been part of the routine that has transformed the necessary drudgery of shaving to an enjoyable time in the day that I actually look forward to.  Not bad for a few bucks.</li>
    <li> I was all ready to buy this brush until I got to checkout. The standard shipping to a US address was within a dollar of the cost of the brush itself. There are many other places online to find this brush with far less onerous shipping costs.</li>
    <li> I saw this item an was skeptical at first,  Seeing the price compared to others I&#x27;ve seen.  But to my surprised this brush works like a charm!  You get a real thick foam built up,holds lotsa moisture!  and I have had no shedding,it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
    <li> Is this a good brush? It made lather and put it on my face. I don&#x27;t see what more I could need. It was stiffer than I expected, but for all I know, all brushes are stiff. I&#x27;m new to this whole thing, but I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This brush will give you such a smooth shave James Bond will be jealous.  I got this brush for Valentine&#x27;s Day to replace an old brush of my grandfather&#x27;s, and it&#x27;s awesome.  It takes much less soap to use, and you can feel it working, but not in an uncomfortable way.  I got a close smooth shave with no knicks or burns, which makes all the difference.  The handle is a nice dark wood stain which makes it look much better crafted than the one in the picture.  You can SMELL the stain when the brush is wet, hopefully that might go away or be less loud the more I use it.  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, skip the multi blade jazz and get a safety razor or a two blade one.  I use a Gilette Atra II razor, and I haven&#x27;t had a better shave since switching to it and a brush.</li>
    <li> What can you say about Tweezerman? Great product, very light-weight and good brush as well. I did notice after about a month that the brush started to give way and had some falling out but nothing major as is expected with just any brush. So far, great product!</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush. I like it a lot. The price was good, and the quality seems good. I have used it half a dozen times in the last 3 weeks, wish only a few hairs coming out. It creates good lathers, and hold a good deal of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because I do not have any other brushes to which I can compare it.</li>
    <li> Please note that this is my first time using a shaving brush as I just got into the whole old school way of shaving. My experience with this brush was that as soon as I first used it the hairs on the brush came off and on to my face. I am assuming this should not be happening. For $15, I guess it did the job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good starter brush for the price. It holds a good deal of water and makes a nice lather.(depending on the soap).</li>
    <li> Well, I bought the Tabac Soap at the same time and someone in a review said by a Badger Brush... and recommended Tweezermans&#x27; for the price... and he was right on the money. Very soft and lathers the soap up very nice... drys quickly and lathers your face with a thick coating quickly. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed shaving and this just makes it even more fun. Now if I can just find a great razor!</li>
    <li> I ordered the shaving brush on March 25, 2010...as of April 26, 2010, I have yet to receive it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;As you&#x27;ve probably seen in your hunt for a badger hair shave brush, they - for the most part - aren&#x27;t cheap. Badger hair is prized for the way it wicks up water and as we all know in wet shaving, water is your friend! Then you found this one. I&#x27;ve purchased 2 of these. The first one I bought was $15, then 2 weeks later they dropped the price to $11 so I bought another. Keep an eye on this one, you may get it for an even better price. I am currently using 1 and keeping the other as a back-up. The fact is, this is a really good economical badger hair brush. It&#x27;s not made with the best badger hair but if it were, it&#x27;d be $150.00 instead of $15.00. I&#x27;ll say this: for beginners and even those with tons of experience but on a budget, you won&#x27;t be disappointed by this little brush. It holds lots of water and it lathers up soaps really well. It&#x27;s very soft on the face and gets into all the little places on the face, including by the nostrils and earlobes. For this price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with it. Very minimal shedding. I&#x27;ve used it probably 30 times and only had to dig 2 hairs out of my shave soap.</li>
    <li> Got this to go with[[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and [[ASIN:B000MXGMHU Col. Conk World&#x27;s Famous Shaving Soap, Bay Rum]].  Brush feels wonderful on my face, holds water well, and creats a nice smooth lather on my face.  Only complant is some of the brisles are starting to shed, but all in all a truly excelent product.</li>
    <li> works pretty well. a few hairs fall out every time i use it but for $15 its kind of not surprising.</li>
    <li> This replaces an old bristle brush. It gives a nice lather and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, this badger hair brush is the best bang for you buck out there.      Of all the inexpensive badger brushes, this is the best bang for your buck.  If you want better quality, then start looking at the $80 brushes.  This $15 brush will perform almost as well, for a fraction of the cost.    There are better brushes, to be sure, which is why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  Mine loses the occasional hair, but not often.  It is not the softest brush out there either, but still better than boar.  If you want better than this, you are going to be spending $80 or more.     Bottom line: You are getting a above average brush for bottom of the barrel prices.</li>
    <li> I finally ordered this to replace my cheap boars hair brush from the local drugstore. I was a little skeptical when I saw the size of the brush in relation to the one I have, but when I used it the skepticism went away. This brush lathers very well with little soap needed and it lasts through 4 passes easily.     This is a Great brush for the money!</li>
    <li> Cheap. Best aspect. Sheds a bit but seems to be calming down. Does have a pretty annoying mink like smell (damn rodents). I think badger hair is overrated. Synthetic that doesn&#x27;t shed or smell works just as well and is a lot cheaper. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but it was cheap enough to try.</li>
    <li> Been using for 9 months now.  I was afraid at first as alot of hairs were coming out but after about 4 months that stopped and I very rarely lose a hair now.  If you want a cheap badger brush thats better than the boar ones then try this.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this shaving brush. It works nicely, I don&#x27;t have bristles falling out. It&#x27;s heavy enough that you know you&#x27;re holding something without being overweight. It sucks in the water and shaving soap nicely and cleans out nicely as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shaving brush. For me, there were no surprises. It works fine, no quality problems, and a great price. Click the \\&quot;BUY\\&quot; button and get on with your shopping.     Using a brush like this and shave soap is a big part of getting a close shave. Probably more important than the razor you use. This brush, some inexpensive shave soap, and my cheap three blade cartridge razor gives me a really close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a wet shaver for over a year now.  I started with a cheap synthetic brush and moved on to this as my first natural hair brush.  I have been using it daily for three months, and it has not held up well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Very good performance, helping to build a lot of lather quickly, better than synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;- Light weight and nicely balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTRAL:&lt;br /&gt;- Smell was a little worse than most other animal hair brushes, but shampoo and conditioner and it went away after a week.&lt;br /&gt;- Brushes are bristly, which can either help exfoliate skin or feel scratchy depending on your preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Loses several hairs each use, not just during the break-in period of the first few shaves, but even after daily shaving for three months.&lt;br /&gt;- Knot was misaligned and overall the brush has a very cheap appearance.&lt;br /&gt;- Coating began to bubble, crack, and flake off within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;- Wood underneath coating dried out and cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the customer images to see what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does its job well, if a little scratchy.  And I could still use it for probably several more months before the knot completely falls apart or the wood itself rots or cracks fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I would not recommend spending the money on this item.  There are a lot of good boar brushes in the same price range that will outlast and outperform this product, such as the [[ASIN:B003BWNR9A Omega Shaving Brush #10048 Boar Bristle aka The PRO 48]].  Or if you do a little research online, you&#x27;ll find places that offer quality badger brushes for a little more money that are very good quality.</li>
    <li> The brush lost 10 hair/day for the first ten days.&lt;br /&gt;Then it went down to 1 a day on average, which is MUCH better than the many, I mean MEANY brushes I have tried in the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;I wet my face, and then rub it with wet soap (And a little glycerin to make it smoother). Then I brush, developing foam until ready for shaving..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you start using this product, be ready for a big disappointment. Don’t give up, it will get worse before getting much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any way not to lose over 100 hair when you start using it?</li>
    <li> So, I just started reading about safety razors and wet shaving.  I bought this brush as a cheap intro badger hair brush.  It works great, especially for the money.  I foamed up my soap nicely in a mug, applied it smoothly to my face, and gave me a great shave.  It did have that initial badger smell when it was wet for the first couple times.  Definitely a great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> This is an average brush for a bargain price. It&#x27;s a step up from the synthetic brush from The Body Shop I was using before, but it&#x27;s no where as nice as some the badger brushes in the $20-$35 range. The hairs are pretty rough and occasionally I feel the brush scratching my face. The hairs also fall out pretty consistently.    Pros: Price, better than synthetic brushes.  Cons: Scratchy, better quality available for $10-$15 more.    Ovarall: 3 stars</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Normally a good brush is suppose to cost way more money. But i just started safety razor blade shaving and i didn&#x27;t wanna take the deep dive so i decided to start with this. Its been over a year, and it still works perfectly, so i don&#x27;t have a reason to buy a 80 pure badger hair brush, this works just as good.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this brush. For only a few bucks more than a synthetic or some other kind of animal hair you can get a badger brush which best for building a good shaving lather. The fist 5 or 6 times I used it I did loose a few hairs but haven&#x27;t since, also this one like most badger brushes did have a certain musky animal smell to it. I didn&#x27;t find it over whelming but did try to get rid of it using shampoos and hand soaps, I read online some folks soak it in Borax but I worried it might damage the hairs. After the 6th use or so the smell was gone so I guess just using it more often might be best. I also wanted to get a stand for it so it would drip dry and prevent bacteria but didn&#x27;t want to spend more on that than I did for the brush so I made one out of a coat hanger. It&#x27;s ghetto but it works! This brush isn&#x27;t the biggest but it gets the job done just fine. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another for myself or as a gift!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this model and have been using it for more than 2 years now and it has worked wonderfully well.  Using my extraordinary reasoning skills, I surmised that if $10 could give me this much of happiness, spending $30 should give me thrice that!  Great logic - but reality isn&#x27;t like that.  The expensive one [[ASIN:B004FO74ME 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Deluxe Olivewood Handle) and Brush Stand from Parker Safety Razor]] was heavier (that is a sort of plus) but it took way too much of soap for lathering.  And it would not fit into the safety razor stand.  And it took veeeery long for lather to come when compared to the tweezerman shaving brush.  So don&#x27;t think twice, and move to Tweezerman&#x27;s  Shaving Brush if you are committing to a shaving brush and value-for-money is what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I had only owned a boar hair brush prior to buying this, so it was my first badger. I also didn&#x27;t own a stand, so for the first few months I had it, I was letting it dry the wrong way, ie bristles pointed up. Now I have a stand, but what&#x27;s interesting is that the brush, after nearly two years, has continued to hold up extremely well, even with my slovenly care. Top notch!</li>
    <li> Well, I was skeptical that an old-time razor would be something that would be so much better than the newest technology of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well a whole package to do it right and all for under a $100.00 to start with everything.  But pry right around $5.00 a month to shave after this month.  I do not like to tout particular products unless I have used them, believe they are better than average and I believe my best friend would thank me for telling them.  Pretty strong words, but I pride myself on not beating around the bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several I believe are of benefit;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor-Lined&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RBF1PO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_img&lt;br /&gt;(They have one of the worst websites for anything more than basic company history but there razor is of the utmost premium quality)you will be glad you left electric with is overpriced then discontinued cutter blades and the super expensive 4-5 blade somewhat disposables that cost a mint and tear your face off each day.

    <li> Appearance/build quality:  I like to have a classy looking bathroom, so I was disappointed when this brush arrived and it had a noticeable crack in the wooden handle, about half an inch long and stemming from the metal rim of the brush.  It also has a noticeable scuff mark on the bottom of the handle.  None of this affects it&#x27;s performance, but for me at least part of the allure of brush/bowl shaving is the nicer look compared to simply using a canned shave cream.  The obvious problems with the brush I received does not speak well for the companies quality control either, though.     Performance:  The brush works well enough, although the bristles are stiffer than I would like and are not softening up as well as I would expect.  It is also losing many of them, usually several per shave.  At this rate it will not be long before the brush is too thin to provide a good lather.      Personally, I don&#x27;t use this brush anymore and only keep it around for traveling and in case something happens to my primary brush (dropping it in the toilet or something).  That said, at it&#x27;s cheap price point it may be a good option if you are looking for a cheap brush just to test out wet shaving with.  Judging from the other reviews here the company&#x27;s quality varies wildly from one brush to another, so it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble.  Honestly I would really recommend buying something else, even if it is a bit more expensive, but your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> This brush is a great value. It feels great and works well with my [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shaving Soap, Ultra Sensitive Skin 5.2 oz (147 g)]]. The only problem I have had, is that for the first few months it lost hairs constantly. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal because I just shaved them off of my face, but it was annoying. For the price you can&#x27;t really beat it though.</li>
    <li> I got it for my father after reading the other product reviews. The price was competitive and after Dad used it for the first time....I was glad I made the right choice. He said a night and day difference compared to his earlier synthetic brush he used to use.      He is hooked for life!</li>
    <li> This brush is a noticeable improvement over the cheap brush I bought at the grocery store. This brush is so much softer and doesn&#x27;t shed like an old dog. I don&#x27;t know if it really improves the effectiveness of my shave but it definitely improves the quality of the experience.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a massive improvement over my old non-badger shaving brush. Seems to pick up the soap better, and spread it easier.    The only problem is that it really, really, really smelled of what I assume is badger. I&#x27;d characterize it as being like a wet dog but angrier, though my wife had colostomy bag flashbacks. First time I used it the smell spread out and filled the bathroom pungently. After soaking it in hot water and vinegar then applying copious amounts of baking soda, my wife proclaims herself content with the smell, though it&#x27;s still there enough that she wouldn&#x27;t want to sniff the brush directly.    Despite that, seems to be a good brush for the price. I&#x27;d suspect that mine might be an outlier in terms of smell, but I don&#x27;t have the experience to say one way or the other.</li>
    <li> We have two pairs of Tweezerman tweezer&#x27;s in our household, and they are very well-crafted.  Durable, precise, and comfortable to use.  So I took a chance thinking the same attention to detail would carry over to this shaving brush.  Alas, that is not the case.  First, the brush I received is not the brush pictured.  Mine came with a shiny chrome handle (?) -- though upon reading some of the one-star reviews describing the wood cracking after only a short period, maybe that is a blessing.  The bristles also started falling out with the first use.  And continued with the second.  I haven&#x27;t yet used it a third time.    All that said, it is cheap for a shaving brush.  For that reason alone, I will not go through the hassle of returning it, and instead will use it until it completely falls apart, then go back to [...]and get a real shaving brush.  I am being generous with two stars for the low price.</li>
    <li> kind of smaller than imagined</li>
    <li> Switching to a DE razor at almost 50 years old, this is my first shaving brush. So far it remains my ONLY shaving brush. So I may not be the best judge as I have nothing to compare it to. I can tell you that it has been in use for approximately 90 shaves and it looks just like it did out of the package. I treat it very well. I do not submerge it in water, I rinse it well, and I hang it bristles down to dry. It lost a few hairs early on and only an occasional one since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat I would offer is that this brush is very soft. I have always used Taylor or Old Bond Street shaving creams. They are very moist and very soft. They do not require any force to lather, only movement. I&#x27;m guessing that if you use a shaving soap that requires a fair amount of pressure to lather, it may be difficult, or at the very least you may see a great deal more wear and tear on the brush than I have seen. I don&#x27;t know how well it would hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then again, as I said, I don&#x27;t have any experience with others for comparison. I know I&#x27;m happy enough with my own experience to have just ordered another for a spare. At this price (you can spend outrageous amounts of money on a brush) you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Have been using this brush for over a year now and no bristle loss, works great.  Couldn&#x27;t even see paying more for one.  Just make sure you hang it to dry it.</li>
    <li> I picked up this brush to replace a synthetic one I tried. This brush produces the best foam. It is even better than the brush that got me started from &#x27;Art of shaving&#x27;</li>
    <li> Some of the bristles come out over time. Upon vigorous use, I have seen as many as three bristles come out. I think the Tweezerman shaving brush is great value. Buying a $100 silver trip badger hair brush is excessive. Start with this one. It does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I take good care of it. That means soaking it first before shaving, squeezing out the cream after you&#x27;re done shaving, rinsing well, squeezing out the water, shaking (or flicking) out most of the water, then *most importantly* hanging it bristles down. Do this and it&#x27;ll be a great shaving brush that doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my horse hair brush.  Atleast I think it was horse hair.  Definitely not badger hair. The Tweezerman brush only cost me $13 so I thought it would be a good place to start with the badger hair brushes which can get quite expensive.    The first couple of times of use it lost some hairs but not alot and that seemed to cease.  The horse hair brush I had was much softer but didn&#x27;t make a lather with the soap like this one does.  This brush creates a nice thick lather with shaving soap, seems fairly well made and dosen&#x27;t look too cheap so if you&#x27;re just getting into using a brush and soap for shaving the Tweezerman badger hair brush isn&#x27;t a bad place to start.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this brush as it harkens back to the olden days when men used these for applying shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Forget getting those brush&#x27;s at the big box stores.  Tweezerman is the real deal.  Parts of the brush do not come out as you use it.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I used a Tweezerman brush for about 7 years and loved it. It became so soft that it didn&#x27;t make good shaving foam and so I ordered a new one. (Note that after all that use - it still had a full set of bristles and looked new - great quality.)  The new one appears to be the same as my old one in style and manufacture, but has about 1/3 less bristles and they are so hard and sharp that I don&#x27;t enjoy using it.  A big disappointment from my first experience with Tweezerman brushes.  I wish they gave comparison information about the bulk of bristles and the stiffness of them so I can buy with confidence without getting to feel the product in person.  I assume there are different levels of quality and I would pay a little more for a higher quality product but do not feel the need for the $150 versions I also see offered by other sellers.</li>
    <li> I hate this brush so much it&#x27;s not even funny. It loses hairs every time, and it simply isn&#x27;t worth buying the same item again to risk getting another bad one. Just buy a better quality one, and stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. If i had to do it all over again i would have spent a few more shekels on a higher quality product. Yes, it does the job but i am constantly picking out hairs from my soap, razor and face. Very annoying. I can only imagine this brush lasting 2 months at most with the amount of hair it loses. Do yourself a favor and steer clear.</li>
    <li> This brush is really hard to beat - especially for the price.  I have other &#x60;high end&#x27; English badger brushes - most costing 5-7X more than this one - that have been relegated to the bench since I got the Tweezerman.  The bristles have a better stiffness to them, and as a result I find that they generate a richer lather and raise my whiskers more effectively.  The one minor caution about this brush is that when I received it and began using it, it did give off a fairly heinous odor.  Smelled, I suppose, like a wet badger!  But fear not, the odor does dissipate with use.  I have a small jar of Barbicide (the blue disinfecting liquid you see at the barbershop) that I use for my straight razors - I dunked the bristles in there for about 10 minutes after the initial use and then gave it a thorough rinse.  That&#x27;s really not a necessary step I&#x27;m sure, but it did seem to help eliminate the odor a bit faster.  I&#x27;ve also used it primarily with scented soaps - in particular Tabac, Proraso and Classic Shaving Menthol - and that also seemed to get the odor neutralized after 5-10 uses.  All in all, this is a really good quality brush at a great price - highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This badger brush was my start into wet shaving with a Merkur Safety Razor. I was interested in improving the shaving experience. This brush has raised the level of comfort unbelievably. It lathers the soap very easily and with minimal effort. If you&#x27;re thinking about abandoning the disposable razors or the expensive blades, use this brush as your starter to try out the safety razor shaving experience.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaving brush, and the price makes it all that much better. I have 4 brushes that I use, I bought them trying to find one that was relatively inexpensive and would lather up like I wanted, this brush is the only one that does all that. You will find that Badge Hair brushes really are superior, and to find one this inexpensive is a bonus. Good Shaving, Go Straight.</li>
    <li> This is no worse quality or workmanship than more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own two (one for home, one to keep in the travel kit) and other than a few hairs coming lose during the early life of the brush I&#x27;ve had no real problems with either of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never shaved with real shaving foam and a brush, grab one of these and some [[ASIN:B003VZPTAC Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street Luxury Shaving Cream]] and discover what you&#x27;ve been missing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now, hasn&#x27;t lost a bristle as far as I can tell. I just make sure to rinse it well after each use and hang to dry.</li>
    <li> just got this brush and impressed with the quality.  Great value for $13 compared to some brushes that are priced much higher.  I can&#x27;t see why anyone would shell out more for a fancier brush when this one is so good.  Glad I bought it..good deal</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving brush quite a few months ago and it has served me well.  It&#x27;s made with quality construction, but as with any natural hair brush, you will notice some hairs come loose on almost every application of shaving cream.  Remember, when storing this item, don&#x27;t store it on it&#x27;s base, or the brush will lose proper form.  Store it on it&#x27;s side or in a hanging shaving brush stand like this one http://www.amazon.com/Omega-172-Chrome-Shaving-Brush/dp/B000K7ESII/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1320932515&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I don&#x27;t have much brush experience. I&#x27;ve had two brushes. A synthetic one, and this one.     This one feel much better than the synthetic. Although the ends are much &#x27;pokier.&#x27; It doesn&#x27;t feel so pleasant if you brush it a little bit wrong. The ends really jab into you.    Some bristles fell out at first. But not many if any at all now. Nice wood base. Works great for the price.</li>
    <li> This brush does a FAR better job of lathering up than the plastic bristle brushes and the imitation hair brushes. I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 6 months now, and it&#x27;s done really well, especially considering its price.     If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive badger shaving brush, that will outperform the plastic shaving brushes, this will do the job quite well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I just received this item and the brush bristles are top notch. However; you may want to know where you glue is currently located. The brush head fell out of the handle the second time I used it.</li>
    <li> Fairly disappointing brush.  It&#x27;s relatively soft, but it&#x27;s pretty small and stinks.  Still has a smell after washing several times.  You&#x27;re probably better off getting a $15 Vulfix or something like that.</li>
    <li> I have owned this for several months now. I use it 2-3 times per week. The first time I used it about 5 hairs fell out, and then 2 per use for the first week. After the first week it loses about 1 hair per month. I for one am happy that I didn&#x27;t buy anything more expensive. I love it. I always rinse it well with cold water and hang it on my Colonel Conk shave stand.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my father for Christmas.   I also bought him a ceramic shaving bowl and round soap cakes plus a new razor and replacement blades to make a \\&quot;shaving system\\&quot; for his gift.  I asked him how he liked the brush.   He said it was very good quality and the dense bristles and dome bristle shape do a great job whipping up a lather from the soap cakes.  He&#x27;s been using shaving brushes for almost 70 years.  He said this is the best quality brush he&#x27;s ever had.  Good value for the money as well.  So the shaving system was a hit for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for about 3 months.  Be sure to break in your brush.  Prior to regular use, in order to help remove loose hairs, you must break in your new brush.  This can be done by washing it with soap and water and gently swiping it in a circular motion, back and forth, in the palm of your hand.  I still loose a few hairs every use.  The wood handle will eventually crack due to water damage, unless you let your brush dry by hanging it by the wood handle, hairs downward.  I love DE shaving and will never go back to disposable razers.  I use a [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] with feather and derby blades.</li>
    <li> Although I ordered the Tweezerman brush shown, I received a chrome-handled \\&quot;Simply Beautiful\\&quot; brush. It seems to be essentially the same item and I have no complaints, but it&#x27;s not what I ordered.    I do have to admit that, for the price, this is a pretty nice brush. The quality of the badger hair is good enough for a beginner like me and it absorbs more than enough water. So far, I haven&#x27;t lost a single bristle and it whips up a nice, thick lather. Although I have nothing to compare it to, the bristles seem a bit \\&quot;prickly\\&quot; which is probably due to the lower quality badger hair one gets for the price.    There&#x27;s little doubt that I will be upgrading to a higher quality brush when this one starts to wear out but, for now, I&#x27;m enjoying this one.    Maybe whoever picked the item from stock made a mistake, or maybe these brushes are interchangeable. In any case, when you receive your order, check it carefully. For whatever it&#x27;s worth, I decided to use it rather than return it and have no regrets.</li>
    <li> After ~2 months of daily use, the brush detached from the handle and could not be reattached.  The brush was great before falling apart, however...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every day for 8 months. In the first couple of weeks, a few bristles fell out. That is the only negative comment I can make. It spreads soap and shaving cream very evenly and creates an excellent lather. It cleans quickly and easily. I wanted something that works well that was not expensive and I am completely satisfied. I recommend this product without any reservations.</li>
    <li> This is an effective brush. I got it for my younger brother who was suffering from razor bumps after using an electric razor for quite a while. He really likes this brush which he uses with [[ASIN:B0015UWUFM Proraso Shaving Soap 5.2 oz (147 g)]] and [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]. He thought the brush was really rough at first but the roughness was alleviated by soaking it in warm water for a while before use. He also thinks the roughness will lessen over time. He&#x27;s used the brush for only a week though so that is only a guess. The brush is also made from badger hair which from my research before buying this product is the best material for a shaving brush. All of our research from youtube indicates that ridding oneself of razor bumps starts primarily with the preparation of your face before shaving. If you suffer from razor bumps, this product is worth a try.</li>
    <li> Use it daily for my face and head.  WILL NOT be going back to the aerosol gels ever.  Brush is nice and soft, price is good and hair doesn&#x27;t fall out.    Best part is it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> A nice badgerhair brush at a price point that doesn&#x27;t make you squeamish.  Obviously there is higher end stuff out there, but for a starter or an every day brush, this one works great.  Yes, some of the hair comes out occasionally, but after a few uses that&#x27;s over with.  Par for the course on any brush, I think.</li>
    <li> I decided over a year ago to stop spending a fortune on shaving and learn to enjoy a great shave.     I started buy buying a double edge razor, the Tweezerman&#x27;s Badger brush, and a tub of Proraso&#x27;s shaving soap.....Now it&#x27;s a year later and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I now look forward to shaving. On top of that I get a better shave and only spent around $50 last year for shaving, which I used to spend in a month and a half just on the new blades.    Trust me ...... buy this brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this brush. I had been using a boars hair brush and had to spend alot of time building up the lather. This badger brush reduced the lather building time by at least half maybe more. I will not be going back to boars hair.</li>
    <li> For the same price you can choose one of several Franks Shaving Badger Brushes, Omega Boar Brushes or The Body Shop Synthetic brush. Any of the alternatives have rave reviews all over the various shaving forums. Although the Tweezerman brush will work, it will also shed constantly and may fall apart. I accidentally ordered two of these and the knot fell out of the handle of the first after a month and both leave badger hair in my soap and on my face. Also, if you read reviews outside of Amazon you&#x27;ll see that my experience isn&#x27;t abnormal. It would appear that wet shaving newcomers with nothing to compare it to are responsible for the good reviews Tweezerman has. However once you&#x27;ve experienced a good quality brush the Tweezerman won&#x27;t be acceptable.  TLDR: Why buy something you&#x27;ll likely replace, just buy a good one once and be done.</li>
    <li> During the third or so shave the bristles came out of the handle in one hairy bundle. I tried re-attaching bristles with wood glue and that worked for a couple months, but it has fallen apart again. Now I am looking for a new, more reliable brush.</li>
    <li> Somehow Tweezerman markets a credible badger-hair brush for a fraction of what you&#x27;d expect, considering the price of the high-end models out there.  Building lather quickly and well is a lot easier with badger.  A drug-store brush is normally made of horse-hair and those don&#x27;t build a good lather.  For brushes, I&#x27;ve owned a horse-hair, a Tweezerman, and a badger silvertip that costs 8 times what the Tweezerman does.  On a 1 to 10 scale I&#x27;d rate a horse-hair brush as a 1, the Tweezerman a 7 and the hoity-toytie silvertip a 10.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this brush stacks up against higher priced models as it is my first. I am very pleased with the brushes performance. I would buy another if needed.</li>
    <li> The bristles began to shed after about a month, then the glue completely released all of them in a clump from the handle after 5 months. I always stored the brush suspended upside down.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for a few months. Then, one day this week, while shaving, the entire handle came apart from the bristles. The bristles were glued to the handle right where you see the bronze-colored ring. I&#x27;m going to email Tweezerman to see if they will replace.  UPDATE: TWeezerman sent me a new brush and it is working fine so far, so I upped my rating to 4 stars, though I struggled between choosing 3 or 4 stars, ultimately giving them the benefit of the doubt. My only complaint about the return is that they asked me, despite my offer to send pictures as proof, to ship the broken one back to them, which cost me about $6.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush so i cant really compare but in my opinion this is a great brush for the price and it gets the job done i think thats all that matters.</li>
    <li> Great buy.  This is my first badger hair brush and I&#x27;m impressed.  Good price, soft hair, and it isn&#x27;t losing many hairs.</li>
    <li> For a cheapy shave brush its great.  Its a some what of a thick and stiff bristled brush that is easy to build a good lather with.  If you are looking for a travel brush or even a everyday brush, this would be a great choice.      Bottom line: It&#x27;s cheap and it does the job...get it!</li>
    <li> I have to say, since I&#x27;m quite the hairy knuckle dragging beast, I&#x27;m always looking out for things that are better; when it comes to shaving.  It usually turns out that the older ways of doing things are much better than a more modern way.  Hence my wanting to get into wet DE shaving.  I will say that this way of shaving is the best I&#x27;ve ever had, though it took me just a little time to \\&quot;unlearn\\&quot; the old habits.      Anyway, about this brush.  I sent it back today and good riddance to it.  It STUNK.  I had to put it back in the box it smelled so badly- it stunk up my appartment.  It smelled like a wet dog and a dead camels south end.    Spend a few extra dollars and get a better one.</li>
    <li> This is a good, quality brush at a reasonable price. I can&#x27;t imagine how much better one costing twice as much or more could add to my shaving. Given how this one is doing -- about 10 months into it and going strong -- I doubt I&#x27;ll bother trying anything else. It sheds a bristle every now and then, or I&#x27;d give it 5-starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s still going strong 8/2012. I&#x27;m bumping it to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now 9/2013 and going strong. Not losing bristles anymore.</li>
    <li> Way too fine; the bristles collapse when trying to load brush and get knotted and tangled when brushing onto face.  A friend sent me a Frank Shaving brush and it was like night and day</li>
    <li> Great starter brush. It lathers, doesn&#x27;t shed much, no stink when new.  This was the first brush I bought and still keep it around and work it into my rotation.  My only downside to it is that because its pure badger it tends to stay a little prickly and never really gets softer after the first few shaves.  Some people like a scratchy brush and its much softer than a boar brush, its just not for me.</li>
    <li> I had been given several other brushes that were made of a variety of hairs or synthetic blends, but none of them compare to 100% Badger Hair.</li>
    <li> Not the best brush you can get for your money, but if you are starting out or want a travel brush this is a nice choice. I use this brush primarily for travel but from time to time I use it at home. It does the job and has held up well.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush when I decided to first get into wet shaving and still use it along with one of my boar hair brushes when I shave. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the handle and yes, the hair does fall out from time to time but not enough to really be a nuisance. Are there better brushes out there? Absolutely. But this one will get the job done easily enough with no problems. I would recommend it for people that are just starting or as a brush for when you&#x27;re travelling since if something happens to it, you won&#x27;t be out a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with a boar bristle brush for years and was happy. But when the last brush died (fell on ther floor and the handle shattered) I decided to upgrade to this Tweezerman brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying it, I visited several web sites on the care of badger bristle brushes. When mine arrived I gave it a gentle wash with shampoo and conditioner. Then I combed it through with the widest tooth comb my wife has. Only a few hairs detached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each time using it, I let warm water run over the bristles (pointing down), and then flick off excess water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen NO further loss or detachment of bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And YES, there is a difference between shaving with a boar bristle and a badger bristle brush.</li>
    <li> loved the brush for the first month i had it, then it fell apart.  the brush fibers came unglued from the handle.</li>
    <li> this brush is twice as effective as the cheap boars hair brushes.  I was impressed how quickly it lathered. It&#x27;s soft and no hair fell out in first 15 uses.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great brush, yes it does shed, but it lathers nicely and is a lot softer than a boar brush.  For the price what do you expect though, it is a great introductory brush for someone who isn&#x27;t sure if they are going to even like using a brush and probably won&#x27;t want to spend 2-10x as much on a higher end one.  I gave it five stars for a brush at this price point not as a comparison across the board for shaving brushes.  Obviously it will be much different that a $200 handmade brush, but who is going to want to make that investment if they don&#x27;t even know if they are going to want to use it in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush works great, does what it is supposed to and is a great alternative to boar or horse hair in the price range.  (although I know some shavers really like the boar and horse)  If the shedding is going to be an issue, then just spend the money and get a higher end brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  While yes the brush did lose some hair when I first used it(first 2-3 shaves), after the initial loss I find that it is no longer regularly shedding, I noticed a hair or two hairs every few uses.  I am now using [[ASIN:B0040QJ34O Kent BLK8 Traditional Large Pure Silver Tip Badger Gents Shaving Brush]], which is much different than the above mentioned brush, but as previously stated it is almost 20x the cost.  I still use my tweezerman in my travel bag and have no issues it is a good brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush a few months ago and I&#x27;d give it a mixed review. This brush is cheap, plain and simple. There are MUCH better brushes out there that will last longer. Mine has been shedding every time i use it for its entire life. Spend the extra money and get a nicer brush. Also, i would HIGHLY recommend getting a brush/safety razor stand to let the brush dry correctly. If you haven&#x27;t tried a mink brush with shave soap, your in for a treat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very attractive and works really well, but when my husband first began using it, it smelled like skunk for the first week. Also, it&#x27;s much fatter then I expected and dosen&#x27;t fit in the old stand. I will have to buy a new stand if I want it to hang dry.</li>
    <li> My husband recently got into \\&quot;old school\\&quot; shaving -- safety razor, soap in a mug, the whole nine yards.  I originally got him a different brush elsewhere that was made of synthetic bristles and did the job OK, but not what he was expecting.  Got him the Tweezerman, which is made with boars hair, and it made a load of difference. He absolutely loves it. Considering most boars hair brushes are upwards of $50 or more, this is an AMAZING bargain</li>
    <li> My first brush and I cannot recommend it. It builds a good lather, but won&#x27;t release soap to your face. The more I used the brush the more lather it REMOVED from my face. Thoroughly disappointed! And as a previous reviewer noted... yes it stinks!</li>
    <li> When discussing shave brushes there are many aspects to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all...Badger/Boar/Synthetic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many variables.  I&#x27;ll break down what I like, and why, and hopefully that will allow you to better understand what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not shave only my face, but my entire head.  I have a goatee, and eyebrows...but everything else is baby&#x27;s butt smooth as much of the time as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that I would prefer a brush that holds more soap than this one, and also one with a large cluster of hairs to cover more area in one swipe.  Also a deeper bristled brush would allow for more soap to stay buried inside, making building more lather on the face easier to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a similarly priced boar brush the tweezerman does feel VERY luxurious against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cheap boar brush will provide an easier time of whipping lather for inexperienced users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the only real complaint I have about the tweezerman is that it&#x27;s too small to cover this much surface area quickly.  But other than that...great deal.  If you also shave your head I might suggest spending a bit more and getting a larger badger brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in May of &#x27;09 and have been pleased with it since the day I got it. I wanted to try straight razor shaving at that time, and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on something that I may not like. I also knew that I wanted a badger hair brush, and that good ones tended to be expensive. This Tweezerman brush is an exception to that rule. The quality is very high, and the price was well worth it. Of course, I&#x27;m still straight razor shaving with this brush and enjoying my morning shave. This is a good brush for starting wet shaving on a budget, but it&#x27;s also just a good brush overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would note that like other reviewers my brush lost some bristles at first. This was maybe ten or twenty in the first two weeks. It continued to lose a few every shave for a while, and then it stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would point out that I do NOT mash the brush down when working up a lather, and that I do so on my face rather than in the cup. Some have noted that this can be hard on your brush (any brush,) but I think that is because of a tendency by some men to mash the brush against their face when doing so. I also shake my brush out pretty thoroughly before hanging it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you are planning to try straight razor (or safety razor) shaving for the first time you need to buy quality items with basic features. E.g. this Tweezerman shaving brush. You will probably spend about $125.00-$150.00 to do it right but economically. Ongoing expenses include periodic sharpening, styptic pencil, and shave soap. Of course, I&#x27;ve saved more than my initial investment since switching. I also get a better, and more pleasant shave.</li>
    <li> I have been a classic shaver (DE) for several years now and own a fair share of related products including some \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; badger brushes. I had been thinking of adding a Tweezerman to the collection and finally ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes packaged in a flimsy plastic pack but that is the only &#x27;cheap&#x27; thing about this brush. I did not notice any funky animal odor upon my initial inspection nor did the brush smell bad when soaked. I ran it through my usual new-brush cleaning routine of a dish-water liquid palm lather followed by a 20 minute soak in a 1/6 part vinegar-water mix. I then left the brush to dry over-night. The Tweezerman knot bloomed beautifully when dry and very soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first shave, I paired it with the \\&quot;Taylor of Bond Street Sandalwood\\&quot; cream. I left the brush to soak in my shave bowl for 15 minutes, shook it gently a couple of times to get rid of the excess water and proceeded to whip up the cream. It created excellent lather in seconds. The feel on the face is very slightly scritchy, the badger hair used are surprisingly soft and of very good quality. After the shave, I gently towel-dried it, then hung it upside down to dry which is important for the longevity of any shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly couldn&#x27;t discern any substantial difference between this and my comparatively expensive Edwin Jagger best badger. In fact, I found the Tweezerman to have a bit more of a back bone for better and easier lather. For the price, Tweezerman badger brush offers great value and performance. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I didnt expect much from such a cheap brush, but it still managed to let me down.  Not only did it give off a horrible chemical smell, but whatever they polish/varnish the handle with dripped off immediately after my first use, leaving my white counter a dirty muddy shade.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely raves about this brush.  He says it is the best for lathering he&#x27;s ever used and he wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to any other kind of brush.  It was a hit!</li>
    <li> This brush is easily on par with many badger hair brushes costing four times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I BELIEVE I KNOW WHY OTHERS WERE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THIS BRUSH ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the previous reviews regarding excessive bristle loss, cracked handles, and the knot coming out of the handle. ALL of these problems are symptoms of improper care and use!  I&#x27;m willing to wager that this is the first shaving brush for most purchasers, who are attracted by its inexpensive price. So, here are some care and maintenance rules for shaving brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although a shaving brush has a flat handle, this is so it can be set down conveniently while shaving. It should NEVER be allowed to dry sitting on its handle. It is absolutely crucial that you rinse the brush after use and then HANG IT WITH THE HANDLE UP (BRISTLES DOWN) in order to dry.  Failure to do so will result in an early demise of your brush -- cracked wood handle, rotting bristles, loosening of the knot, etc. You can make a holder out of wire or a coat hanger if you do not want to buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when whipping up lather, your finger tips should be grasping the base of the bristles where they meet the handle, with the flat of the handle against your palm. Whip the lather using only the TIPS of the bristles. You don&#x27;t want to \\&quot;squash\\&quot; the bristles while whipping up the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, when you rinse the brush, hold it bristles up under a gentle stream of water. Then, hold it with the bristles down and wring the bristles by gently squeezing the bristles between your fingers and thumb. Now, holding the brush where the bristles and handle meet between your forefinger and thumb, GENTLY shake the brush two or three times. Vigorous shaking holding only the handle will damage the brush. Now hang the brush with the handle up to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow these rules -- which are standard for any brush -- and you should enjoy years of shaves from your Tweezermans brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[UPDATE #1:  I wrote the above after two months of use.

    <li> You get what you pay for. Brand new, my Tweezerman brush shed like a sick cat, smelled bad when wet, had a small crack on each side of the handle, and even had a small piece of paper embedded in the lacquer. I wish I could return it, but I tossed the packaging and didn&#x27;t get around to using it for a month. I think the shedding has finally stopped and the smell is gone (probably from the glue) but I&#x27;m going to sand and refinish the handle.  It works, but it&#x27;s definitely the bottom of the barrel for a badger hair brush.  Get something better if you have the money.</li>
    <li> Great brush, thick and just stiff enough, feels durable and works up a thick lather!  I&#x27;ve had expensive ones and this one is just as good.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> It is the worst shaving brush i ever used.The bristle are so hard and rough, definitely not meant for you face,may be for polishing the shoes.I tried twice with different shave gel but results are the same.You dont want to use it unless you are punishing yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a year.  It started out great - holds the right amount of water, creates good lather and is great for face application.  About a month ago it started losing a great amount of hair each time I use it.  It has gotten so bad that I just ordered a replacement - 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand from Parker Safety Razor.  I&#x27;m hoping this will last longer and I like the stand/holder.</li>
    <li> this is one of the cheapest i bought in amazon.  just wanting to try it out.  never knew it would be one of the best things i&#x27;ve ever bought here.    good product.  fast delivery service and reliable.</li>
    <li> I have used \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; brushes for years.  This brush is not that big and the handle is wooden but this brush is high quality and does the job.</li>
    <li> For the price, this brush cannot be beat!  If you are looking to get into wet shaving this is a great purchase.  My only complaint is that the bristles are a bit stiff, but perhaps they might soften with more use.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable badger hair brush.</li>
    <li> This Badger Brush is a good shaving brush.  I am new to this method of shaving along with using a safety razor.  I was looking for a low price - quality brush since I am new to this kind of shaving avenue.  This Badger brush does loose a few bristles when starting to use it depending on what you use (shaving cream, shaving soap, and etc.).  I was happy with the price that I paid for the brush, as I wanted to see if I would enjoy using a shaving brush and safety razor.</li>
    <li> Brushes like this can serve many purposes beside putting shaving cream on your skin. For fine delicate items that need to be cleaned without scratching just put what you need on it and brush away. The bristles are soft and not too tightly compact. They flex enough so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of pressure. I use it with a few drops of oil to brush on a surface that just needs a light coating or to get in tight areas that doesn&#x27;t need a drenching. Comes in a nice plastic case to store and keep it clean. Case was probably meant as a throw-a-away, but it is useful.</li>
    <li> I think this Tweezerman brush is a great starter brush.  I bought it about a month ago and i am very pleased with its performance.  For the price it is a great brush.  I wanted to get into DE shaving but i wasn&#x27;t sure if i would like it, so i didn&#x27;t want to go out and get an expensive brush.  Unlike other reviews i have not had problems with this brush shedding hair.  I would recommend this brush to any new wet shaver.  If you are in the market for wet shaving  [...] is a great source.</li>
    <li> For the price, I can&#x27;t complain.  This was my first brush.  My next brush I will look for more bristles, and subsequently a fuller head.  But I can&#x27;t complain, as those brushes run upwards of 100+ dollars.  This is a great brush for the price, and if taken care of, will last!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a badger brush, one thing I noticed was loose hairs right off the bat, but the more I used it the fewer hairs feel out.  I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 3 weeks now and it no longer has the issue of losing hair, I did however have to improve my technique of applying shave soap, anything hard is worth doing.</li>
    <li> Just used this brush for the first time, also my first shave with a safety razor.      The brush seems fine.  It&#x27;s got a wood handle, its a good size and length and seems to be well made.  They aren&#x27;t really clear but I assume this brush is rated Pure on the Pure/Best/Silvertip scale.  So it does what they say it does and is what they say it is.    As i understand a Pure brush is put together and then cut to shape, the result is that at least for the first use the bristles felt a little sharp, or harsh on my face.  which I expect will improve with time as I use the brush.      It&#x27;s probably exactly what you expect, a good beginner brush that let&#x27;s you experiment with DE shaving without spending a fortune on the nicer brush you will buy later if you stick with it.</li>
    <li> Works great to build a lather up and distribute the shaving cream while massaging. Cleans easily. Bristles have been holding strong for two years of use.</li>
    <li> Good buy for the money. Had bad smell for about 2 weeks that gradually dissipated.  Occasionally looses a few bristles.  Used it daily for two years now. Can&#x27;t beat it for less than I spend for two sandwiches at Jimmy Johns.</li>
    <li> works as intended.  the finish on the wood is starting to crack and peel off</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about this brush and was hesitant to buy it because it&#x27;s so cheap. Several of the other reviews talked about how it loses hair. I saw a few reply to those saying that if you take proper care of it then it won&#x27;t. Well, I assure you it still does. It started losing hair the first time I used it and has continued several shaves later. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I began D.E. shaving about 2 months ago.  Like many I bought this brush since it was inexpensive and I needed everything to get started.  The brush works like a champ, doing everything I needed it to do.  Mixing creams in a bowl is my technique for lather.  I hear a lot of complaints about this brush losing hairs, the knot coming out of the handle, etc.  The trick to help prevent this is to make sure that after soaking the brush (never have the water level into the knot) is to flick the excess water out by holding the bristles with the thumb and index finger.  This will help prevent losing the bristles from the handle due to excessive force. Also make sure to hang the brush on a stand so that water will not drain back into the handle and it can properly dry.  This will ensure that the glue holding the bristles will not break down.  After a couple of weeks soak the brush in dishwashing soap and swirl it around to remove residue.  I have since added an Omega boar brush to my small collection, but the Tweezerman badger is still in the rotation.  For me, this was a good first purchase in a brush. As with all brushes, will give great service if properly cared for.</li>
    <li> I have had this for two weeks and it seems to be fine. I don&#x27;t see any bristles coming out. My only complaint is that it is really short and with my big hands I have trouble working it in a regular sized shaving mug. Of course I have bear paws so this may only be my problem. For the money though I will use it up!</li>
    <li> The brush is not the most comfortable I&#x27;ve used; but I lived with it. Then it broke up. The bristles detached from the handle all at once. This is a poor quality product. My previous brush lasted 20 years! This one lasted a few months.</li>
    <li> I am using it with Large Stainless Steel Shaving Soap Bowl that came as part of a larger Christmas gift. Works as it should, however with all new brushes you should know that a stray hair or two or three will come off initially. Expect that. Other than that, I do expect to enjoy it for quite a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because it was inexpensive and it was made from real badger hair. When I got it, it had a particular smell on it that has not quite gone away. It lingers around, and contaminates my shaving soap. It is also a bit short, I would prefer a longer brush. Although it is made from badger hair, it is a bit coarse. Not quite as soft as I hoped for. However, for the money, it is a decent brush. If it were a little longer, I don&#x27;t think I would have minded all the other imperfections.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for our father who is 89 years old and only knows this way of applying any shaving product and his old one was worn down very far.</li>
    <li> Great bang for your buck! I&#x27;ve had mine over a month with very minimal shedding. Smell goes away after first or 2nd shave. Good daily use brush</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for four months and it has been pretty good. Although now it doesnt flare out taking a shurnken shape. Maybe its because I didnt store it properly as I would shake out the water and place it in a cup. Decent for the price but I think I will be upgrading soon.</li>
    <li> It is a soft brush and is worth the money.  I get a good lather in a reasonable time.  I will consider it again when I need another brush.</li>
    <li> I read at the reviews before I bought this. I am happy with the decision. I did not give 5 stars since it has an odd smell which is prominent when you lather near your nose. I got used to it. Apart for the smell it is a great brush to have. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this brush a shot since I was pleased with the boar bristle brush I picked up at WalMart.  Key word being pleased.  The Tweezerman badger hair brush was amazing!  It was much more soft, and generated a better lather.  Make sure you get a brush stand to allow the brush to dry upside down!  This brush will treat you right during your shaving routine.  For the money a really great starting badger hair brush and a great compliment for anyone interested in wet shaving.</li>
    <li> You are looking through reviews because you aren&#x27;t sure about buying this. Yes hairs do fall out from time to time but it stops after the first couple shaves. My only complaint is that the smell was initially bad because I guess it is beaver but soon the soap or shaving cream masks that smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 months and would buy it again if I ever had to.</li>
    <li> When I received the brush, there was a little knocking sound, which I figured was just due to it being a relatively cheap brush. The next day, I soaked the brush for a few minutes in a little bit of water, shook it out, and hung it up to dry (bristles pointing down). Then the next day, I did another soak for a few minutes and shook out the extra water before building up some lather on my face. While applying more shaving cream for my second pass (and using the correct grip), the handle separated from the bristles. The bristles did not separate from the glue; The glue actually broke - half was on the bristles and half in the handle. So, clearly there was a reason for the knocking sound I heard when I unboxed the brush... it was already broken (or darn close to broken) when I got it. On the plus side, the brush builds better lather quicker than my cheapy boar brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Upon further inspection, it turns out there was an air bubble in the glue that secured the knot in the handle. I was able to fix my brush by roughing up the surfaces involved and applying some Devcon epoxy. I&#x27;ve been using the repaired brush 2 or 3 times a week for 5 months without any more problems. The brush is definitely worth the price, especially for beginners. It works up quite a good lather for me but, as with all wet shaving tools, your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I used a generic brush from CVS for months as my first shaving brush before finally ordering this one. While I&#x27;m sure the $70+ brushes are softer, this little tool works great for me! I&#x27;ve noticed zero shedding and my cream lathers up just fine. What more could I ask for from a $15 (or less) brush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My list of Amazon-acquired shaving supplies:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003BHCAGQ Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000S5PV56 Merkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor #38 + 10 Free DE Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000F5NRQY Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Pre-Shave Oil, 2 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000RG8D6K Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Aftershave Balm]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00020UQQQ Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Shave Cream Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004COMB5W Osma Styptic Pencil, Hemo Stop]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G5HZCY Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
    <li> The knot seems loose. It loses several bristles every time I shave. It also had an acrid smell, similar to turpentine when it arrived.</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;it is cheap and it is badger.&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;it is too cheap and it is lowest grade badger and it is aweful.&lt;br /&gt;out of the box it smells badly. it seems to vary and some folks reported no odor. not mine: have you hugged a wet badger today? They probably got the hair for mine from the area next to badger social glands...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;phew...&lt;br /&gt;after a lot of rinsing (with shampoo, dish soap, vinegar in water and more dish soap) i got it to something i would consider putting against my face.&lt;br /&gt;the good news is that after a few shaves most of the smell is gone. I found out that lathering it up with soap and letting it sit with it for an hour helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are pointy/prickly and I am not fan of the feel.&lt;br /&gt;Even the Van Der Hagen boar brush (the one that comes with the ~$10 set) is better... at least from the feel against the face perspetive (it is also junk because it sheds like there is no tomorrow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is overpriced period, because for ~20$ you can get some really nice brushes like a good Frank Shaving Sytnethic(which is excellent) or a the excellent badger brushes from whipped dog or an Omega boar (~$10).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how come so many people gave it 4-5 stars? because it is a newbie brush and most newbies don&#x27;t what are the alternatives and how poor value this brush is. In other words, the positive reviews came from people who know nothing. So what if it makes lather, you can also use a dirty sock from you hamper to rub shaving cream on your face, and it would smell better - thats for sure.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to using a safety razor and bought this brush to assist in my new undertaking.  This does just the trick for me and is cheap and seems durable.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it falling apart.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this for a beginner, considering that other badger brushes are $30+.</li>
    <li> Floppy, smells, and poor for hard soaps. Do not recommend and I would recommend boar bristles for hard soap :-)</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this brush, and I tried!  The brush head itself  is very nice.  Builds up nice lather and holds heat well, unlike the Van Der Hagen boar brush I have.  Can&#x27;t say the same for the build though.  Had this for about two weeks and the handle came apart from the brush head.  Got a replacement from Amazon and the same thing happened to the replacement.  I use a stand to store it upside down after using it too, although I do soak it in hot water to soften up while I&#x27;m showering, as recommended by the wet shaving community. Gonna try using some supper glue to keep it on this time and eliminate the soak step.  Hopefully that will work!  But I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that!</li>
    <li> I have owned this brush for 10 months now and I have used it daily. It is still in excellent shape and serves its purpose very well. I was somewhat concerned when I purchased it due to some reviews questioning its quality and reporting that the bristle part of the brush separated from the handle. I have had no such problems. It does shed a bristle or two from time to time but this is normal. I squeeze out and fluff the bristles after each use and store it bristles down. It looks as good now as the day I bought it. I will post a picture.... It is smaller than I anticipated but big enough to work up and store a good amount of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush along with a Colonel Conk Model 111 Santa Fe Shave Cup and Green Proraso Shaving Cream. Shaving has gone from being a daily chore to a daily event that I thoroughly enjoy.</li>
    <li> Badger hair really is nicer than pig bristles, and at this price, this brush makes it well worth the trouble to switch.  Hotter lather, faster (and with a handle that&#x27;s really well shaped for reaching into the mug)- makes shaving a joy again.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Real badger hair, excellent price.  Cons:  The hairs fall out every single time you use it.  All in all, I would recommend this brush to anyone just starting out with wet shaving.  Maybe down the road go for an upgrade.</li>
    <li> I noticed quite a few reviewers were commenting on the smell?????  I noticed enough comments that I curiously smelled the product when it arrived...I didnt notice any FOUL odor as others described. I used the product and it performed as most others describe. SUPERBE.  Gives a great lather when applied on top of Proraso pre shave cream. Even after use (wet) I didnt notice any unwelcome odor. Not sure what others are talking about. This is an outstanding product.  Firm bristles exfoliate and lather unsurpassed by boar bristle brushes. I am also following recommendations to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;......which is DO NOT.... Allow this to dry upside down on its handle. Either find/buy a brush hanger, or dry on its side. Also the most affordable badger brush on the market.</li>
    <li> I have bought other brushes that have fallen apart in a month, but this is a very good quality.  Make sure you hang it up to dry with a brush holder and it will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Did a great job.  Washed with shampoo and let set for 5-10min with conditioner before rinsing out.  If you take care of it and store in a stand, it will last you a very long time.  Has not lost one hair.    A real winner.</li>
    <li> Brush holds the soap well and is soft but I thought the badger was still alive.  The badger Oder is still there can&#x27;t seem to get it out.  Any suggestions? Other than that it seems to be a nice brush for the price.</li>
    <li> If you are new to wet shaving then this is the first brush you should buy. Shaving enthusiasts can get wrapped up extolling the virtues of triple-digit dollar brushes.  It seems a little excessive. I would recommend this for even the experienced shaver. If nothing else, make it your travel brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is pure badger.  It is not too soft - firm enough to create lather and gently exfoliate. However it quickly breaks in to be gentle enough to the paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At such a value, even if you want to acquire many brushes, this is a worthy addition.  For the man contemplating wet shaving, here is a good brush that is not a high risk purchase should you decide safety razor  shaving is not for you</li>
    <li> not quite a boars hair brush, but it does the trick... lather holds really well, and I get a good feeling when I use this brush. Good price, good deal.</li>
    <li> I used this brush for a few weeks and today, the part that holds the bristles came unglued and fell right out of the wooden handle.  Wasted my money on this brush. :-(</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after using the boar brush that comes in the VDH Deluxe set from Walmart. Although the boar brush does a good job, I really don&#x27;t mind using it, this Tweezerman is a lot softer than the boar brush. That&#x27;s the main reason I bought it. I am a wet shaver and have very sensitive skin. The lathering up with this (with CO Bigelow Proraso) is great. Takes a very short time to get my lather ready. After washing it to use it for the first time, I only noticed that TWO! hairs fell into my white sink.Just TWO!  It held up nicely even though I scrubbed and scrubbed it with shampoo. I am very happy with my purchase. Will post pictures of it as well. Hope this helped anyone that can&#x27;t make up their mind about which brush to get. Will it be the perfect one for you? Maybe, Maybe not. But this brush performs well and is not in any way a waste of money.</li>
    <li> For the price, seemed like it couldn&#x27;t be too bad. Worked alright for first shave with it. Handle separated from the bristles as I was building lather for the brush&#x27;s second use. Read the other reviews, the separation of bristles and handle seems to happen to a significant amount of people.</li>
    <li> It does the job well. Just a little bit of shaving cream goes a long way as the brush creates a thick lather. And the shaving cream rinses off nicely, and one shake of the brush gets rid of all the water, and dries quickly. Great product at a fraction of the cost of the competition.</li>
    <li> Just opened my package, and the brush had already come unglued from the handle during shipping. What cheap manufacturing! If it falls apart before I even start using it, I don&#x27;t hold out much hope for long-term endurance.  Might have been an ok brush otherwise, but I won&#x27;t get to find out. I&#x27;m returning mine for a refund, and I&#x27;ll probably order something different next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving since I was 12 years old and have tried every combination of razor, cream and gel you can imagine.  About 4 years ago I had a good old fashioned barber shop shave and was floored by how comfortable the shave was.  I had never been able to duplicate it.  I have a great deal of Scandinavian blood in me so my beard grows fast, thick and curly.  I read that using a brush will help make the hair stand up properly for a better shave.  The brush arrived yesterday and it is a very beautiful piece for sure.  The brush really did make a difference, I have never had this close of a shave at home before and I had no razor bumps or burns afterwards.  If you have a curly beard or a stubborn beard, this will help you get that close shave you&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
    <li> It seems a little light and moderate build quality, but it works fine and I&#x27;ve only lost a few hairs now and then. I make sure to rinse it thoroughly and let it dry with the bristles down and I&#x27;m confident it will last for awhile. Overall, I like it and don&#x27;t regret buying it - especially at the price!</li>
    <li> The brush I received had a terrible case of \\&quot;badger smell\\&quot;.  After weeks of trying to get the smell out with alternating soaks of vinegar and soap it still stinks.  Initially it stunk up the entire open area of the apartment, and I had to cover and close the brush into a cupboard.  It was bad enough I felt the need to write my first review.  Unlucky, I suppose, but I feel from now on I would only buy brushes from local retailers now where I have the option of returning a potentially stinky brush with less hassle than mailing it (even if I spend a multiple more for the product).  It seems there are plenty of people that are happy with the brushes they received and for between 10-20$, this product offers great value at that price point.  I simply didn&#x27;t have that experience.    For the product&#x27;s sake, I did test it a few times.  Brushes do a great lathering job, and it does that.  It lost a few hairs initially, but seems solid after a few uses.    *Note: my experience has everything to do with the product I have experience with, and nothing to do with any of the distributors supplying the product.    **Note: Before purchasing, I wasn&#x27;t aware that some brushes have these odors.  Give it a search for yourself.  The recommended remedy is soaking the brush in a solution of water and vinegar, soap, or borax and for most people the problem is solved within a week.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaving brush a couple months ago. After its initial shedding period the brush has lost very few bristles. The bristles are firm and give a good lather. I use a brush stand that points the bristles down when drying to keep the bristle glue from loosening.</li>
    <li> This is my first badger brush.  First of all?  What the h@#$ is that smell?  Badger crotch-rot?  Are these, by chance, the hairs from the area closest to the badger&#x27;s anal glands (look it up - this odor is vile)?  Somebody here suggested a (singular) shampooing and conditioning.  HA!  Try witch hazel, soaps, bleach, acetone, oxy clean and vinegar (I didn&#x27;t try gasoline, tolulene, B-12 chemtrol or Seafoam or Tears of Chuck Norris)!  Holy crap.  What is that odor?  Nevertheless, I like the performance of the brush.  After about 3 weeks, the bristles have softened up nicely.  I will be getting another brush (can we say \\&quot;upgrading?\\&quot;).</li>
    <li> My only surprise (I won&#x27;t even call it a complaint) was that when I first used it - the animal smell became VERY pronounced. I had to wonder how many badgers lost their pubic hairs to make this brush! But the smell soon subsided after another use or two. Now it smells like soap and awesomeness.     The feel is wonderful as is its ability to produce a lather. I&#x27;m an artist so taking care of a brush is already second nature - I keep it dry and clean in-between shaves and I only lose a hair or two when I use it. Very happy early on, we&#x27;ll see how it lasts during the long haul.</li>
    <li> For what you pay for this badger brush, you cant go wrong. Of course there are more expensive and better quality brushes out there but this one isnt a slouch by any stretch of the imagination. Good badger brush that lathers extremely well. You may lose a couple hairs initially here and there but no biggie. Also mine didnt have a bad smell at all. After reading the numerous reviews i smelled the brush as soon as i got it to see what the fuss was about. While it does have a distinct smell it is nothing that is overpowering or unbearable, and it goes away with use. Bottom line if want a good badger brush this is a solid choice that wont break the bank. Great starter or daily use brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a travel brush for my trip to England so I wouldn&#x27;t risk losing my expensive badger brush. I used it a total of 4 times. 3 times before I left to break it in and 1 time at the hotel. The entire knot fell out in my hand during the fourth shave. Extremely irritated and disappointed. I didn&#x27;t expect the best brush ever but I expected to get more then 4 shaves out of it.</li>
    <li> The Tweezerman Shave brush is brush that Works well for &#x27;Face-Lathering&#x27;.  It does not hold enough lather or water to bowl lather for me.  Very prickly at first then eventually breaks in and softens up.  Just remember, this brush is Small.  Smaller than you think it is.  If you&#x27;re beginning, you can buy this brush, I wouldn&#x27;t bash you for it, but Please spend a couple extra bucks and buy a Vulfix Super Badger brush, I would take ONE Vulfix over a free lifetime of Tweezermans (and believe me, you would to!)</li>
    <li> This brush is a great value. It&#x27;s one of the least expensive badger-hair brushes you&#x27;ll find, and it will perform just as well as any of them. If you&#x27;re looking for your first shave brush, save yourself the disappointment of boar-hair and start with this brush. The handle is a simple natural wood handle, with the unfortunately conspicuous TWEEZERMAN branding. If you ever upgrade to a higher-end brush, you&#x27;ll be happy to keep this around in your dopp kit for travel.</li>
    <li> Bought minds over a year ago and its still going strong.  Gives a good lather and the price is great!</li>
    <li> I am just beginning the process of wet shaving using non-cartridge razors and brushes.  I bought a NOS shaving kit at an antique store, which had a mug, soap, and a boar brush.  That led to me buying this at the local grocery store for $15, and so far so good.  Much better than the boar brush, it does loose hairs but I figured that was normal.  I can&#x27;t compare it to anything other than my old boar brush and I&#x27;d rate this as a MUCH better brush at making a good lather.  For $15 I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong.</li>
    <li> have used this brush about ten times since delivery.  the softness and fullness  of this style is great.  I you want to enjoy the small pleasure of being a man while shaving, get this brush!</li>
    <li> I just started using shaving soaps and a straight razor a few weeks ago. I purchased this brushed based on the reviews. I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to spend so after researching carefully I chose this one. I realize the more expensive ones may be better, however I asked myself these questions when deciding on a brush.  When you have shaved in the past what has made you more prone to irritation-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Shaving cream/ soap you are using?&lt;br /&gt;2- The razor you are using?&lt;br /&gt;3- The method in which you apply your shaving cream/soap?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would conclude razors and cream/ gels are the bigger irritants. For this reason I didn&#x27;t see the brush making that much of a difference in the shaving process. I chose to put a little more money into the soap and the razor itself. I am sure the cheap ones are not great but for the price I am happy with this one that is more middle of the road.</li>
    <li> Good starter badger brush, some hair fell out on the first use but now it seems to be fine. Definitely recommended for a first badger brush.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush at a great price! I am relatively new to the world of straight blades (about a year or so), but I do know that this is MUCH better than my boar brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Tweezerman for over a year now.  I have four other brushes to compare it with.  On the positive side, it is inexpensive, the bristles dry relatively quickly (nice travel brush), and has stiff bristles that make it easy to lather soaps and creams.  On the negative side, the tips are fairly scratchy, the loft is not uniform in shape, it continues to shed bristles, and worst-of-all the wet bristles stink to this day.</li>
    <li> But they really do.  I had a boar&#x27;s hair brush before this, and the badger bristles really are far superior.  It takes a lot less soap to make a good lather with the badger.  If you&#x27;re a brush user, definitely give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good price for a brush, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  The bristles did not feel so great on my face, they were actually fairly painful rubbing on my face.  The brush must have lost about 10 bristles the first time I used it.  While this one is on its way back to amazon I may try another.</li>
    <li> This is the best badger brush for the money.  Period.  Feels good on my face, works up a good lather, dries well, and beats the crap out of my old boar hair brush.  My only qualm is that it smells kind of badgery, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Being a fan of Tweezerman products, I did not think I&#x27;d find any problems with this shaving brush as others had. I currently use a boar hair shaving brush that has seen better days. I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money into a badger brush and thought this was a good option. I was displeased to find that this was not worth the wait....which was a loooong wait by the way.    The first thing I noticed was just how light it was, like it was made of balsa wood. Weight really shouldn&#x27;t matter because it&#x27;s just a brush I&#x27;m sticking in soap and rubbing on my face once a day but I must say, it felt really cheap. And like others, mine had a lot of hairs come out. Others have complained about the smell and mine smelled too but not to the extent that I wouldn&#x27;t use it. I mean really, it comes from an animal. My boar brush smelled as well which quickly left as I&#x27;m sure it would on this if I were to keep it.     On closer inspection, this cheap wood is split at the top where it meets the bristles which is what prompted me to return it. For around 16 dollars I was willing to put up with hairs falling out and an initial smell, but a crack in the handle is a deal killer. I can see in the future that moisture being allowed into the wood causing it to expand and then contract would render it completely useless when the entire knot loosens from the handle. I suppose with a little creative engineering, I could plug the crack but in this day and age, I&#x27;m tired of spending money on products that are sub-par.    Based on other reviews, I think this particular shaving brush is a hit or miss. Unfortunately mine was a miss. I do appreciate the hassle free return policy and I will be using it.</li>
    <li> This brush worked well for the first three years but is now loosing a few hairs every time I shave and NO I don&#x27;t store it bristles up.  I store this blade in an old ceramic shaving mug with a side spout for holding brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now going back to using my 1992 purchased heavy (sterling silver handled) silver hair badger brush just as a change of pace.  FYI avoid metal handle brushes as they are a pain to keep clean &amp; POLISHED (their handles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTN NEWBIES:  If your just starting DE shaving this brush will do you right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four out of Five stars... A good silvertip badger hair brush rates 5+ stars IMO.</li>
    <li> I just started wet shaving with brushes and lathers. I started off with a boar&#x27;s hair brush because it was really cheap. But it didn&#x27;t produce much lather with the Proraso i had bought.   This badger hair brush is way better. Holds water better. Produces way more lather. Dries well.  I did notice that it did have a smell. Not too powerful though. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll go away after a few shaves and washes. My first shave about 6 hairs fell out. I hope this isn&#x27;t going to be a problem though.   I&#x27;m really hoping this brush lasts.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is a perfect brush for the starting shaver. I&#x27;ll certainly be moving up to a higher-quality model as I become more experienced with \\&quot;real\\&quot; shaving (using a safety razor and actual blades), but I&#x27;m quite satisfied for now. I started out practicing my lathering technique using a modern disposable razor and a shaving soap, to get a good feel for the Tweezerman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-CHEAP! Tweezerman is about the cheapest brush you can get, while still getting quality.&lt;br /&gt;-Badger Hair. Most brushes at this price level are boar hair, which is stiffer and sometimes prickly. Badger hair is a little softer, more luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;-Good knot. This is a fairly small brush, but it blossoms into a good shape that does the job well. I have massive hands, and the small handle still works perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;-I think the smaller size is the key to the price- this is a \\&quot;lite\\&quot; version of a higher-quality product. It&#x27;s still sized to work well, but there&#x27;s extra bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly rough. My wife felt the tip, and being used to feminine-soft makeup brushes, she was not impressed by the Tweezerman. I&#x27;d call this brush \\&quot;medium-soft\\&quot;, and I&#x27;d prefer soft.&lt;br /&gt;-Sheds. Top-quality, carefully tended brushes are handed down from father to son. The Tweezerman is not one of those brushes. Even in my first use, I had to fish a couple of hairs out of the lather.&lt;br /&gt;-So-so build quality. The top coat of lacquer on the handle had dripped in one spot. There&#x27;s a pea-sized knob on the handle, and I had to pull a little bit of goop out of the hair. There&#x27;s no issue in using the product, but it&#x27;s another small area where you feel the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the perfect brush for a beginner. It&#x27;s cheap, but it has the feel of a brush worth at least twice the price. I&#x27;d almost list the shedding as a bonus- by the time this brush gives out, it&#x27;ll probably be the perfect time to finally decide if you&#x27;re going to stick with it and spend money on a high-end brush. I recommend the Tweezerman highly for beginners, and for anyone who might be looking for an occasional brush to try out in their lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: With some actual usage under my belt, this brush holds up very well. I still lose a hair on occasion, but it&#x27;s not a big annoyance and it&#x27;s clear the brush will hold up to years of use. I&#x27;ve also tried a cheaper boar brush from Burma, and the difference is immense. The lather I can accomplish working for five minutes with the Burma, I can work up in thirty seconds with my Tweezerman. I&#x27;ll even admit that I was a bit wrong on the softness- I&#x27;d like a bit more stiffness for scrubbing my face, but the tweezerman holds lather so well that I wouldn&#x27;t risk going much more firm without assurances.for beginners, and for anyone who might be looking for an occasional brush to try out in their lineup.

    <li> I bought mine a couple years ago. I&#x27;ve become so accustomed to it that I miss it when I travel. I have had no hairs fall out (like some people complain). I recommend i for anyone who shaves.</li>
    <li> Works great and at a the best price point I have seen with other Badger hair brushes....makes sure to drip dry upside down and wet first before using with the cream!</li>
    <li> After reading all these awesome reviews of this Brush I decided to buy it. It is hands down the worst purchase I made on Amazon. This Brush absolutely STINKS! Not only that it doesn&#x27;t lather properly it has a foul smell that you cannot get rid of. I used it for 3 weeks and tried every trick in the book to get rid of the smell but nothing helped. I ended up throwing it away. My Omega brush that I picked up in a convenience store for $8 bucks does a way better job.  I would not recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> Initially, I was happy with this little brush.  It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but that actually made it a nice size for travel.  The bristles were a little stiff at first, but it lathered up nicely and it seemed to be softening, with each use.  Unfortunately, after about a year of light use (it was my travel brush, not my everyday brush), the brush head popped out of the handle.  There was no way to re-attach and, eventually, I had to throw it out.  I may have been unlucky with my particular brush, but the price did seem too good to be true.  My daily use brush (Art of Shaving) was much more expensive and has held up to daily use without any problems.    I would recommend spending more to get a higher quality brush.</li>
    <li> I have just begun to shave with a brush and mug soap, so I am no expert.  However, this inexpensive brush seems to shed a great meany hairs (badger I assume).  Have used the brush about a dozen times and it is still shedding.  Not sure if this is normal, but I have some hairy shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Great shaving brush.  I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year.  I&#x27;ll buy another one if this one wears out.  Just wash it out well, vigorously shake the brush out, and hang to complete the drying process.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter brush or for someone who wants a quality shaving brush for a great price. A few hairs will come out and it will smell a little like wet dog for about a week, but all that goes away quickly. I started using this along with the Proraso shaving soap about a week before I received my DE Safety Razor. Whether you decide to switch to the traditional double edge safety razor or stick with a cartridge razor, I would recommend start using shaving soap and a brush. The brush and soap as opposed to the canned shaving cream makes shaving a much more enjoyable experience and also leaves you with healthier cleaner skin.</li>
    <li> It has been about 3 weeks of using this product, and I am still losing about 5 hairs each shave.  It has become much, much softer, but I don&#x27;t know about the shedding- leaves me a little suspect as to the quality of the knot.  I have read many reviews on this brush, and some shedding within the first short while is normal, however, this extended period of shedding isn&#x27;t right...might be just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush was really stinky when it came, however, a cleaning protocol- hot water with Dawn soak for an hour, hot water rinses (30 min each) x3, hot water with vinegar x 30 min, and then 2 iterations of 8 hours sitting in lather worked like a charm.  No smell any more (other than Proraso!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m by far happier with this brush than with my previous one.  Minimal shedding and applies a nice thick lather.  I would advise getting a stand to keep it on, though admittedly had I done that with my other one it may have lasted longer.  I&#x27;m a big fan of the badger hair bristles as well.  After some light shedding following my first few uses I rarely lose any bristles now.  An excellent brush, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This brush pokes my face with stiff bristles no matter how much hot water and shave cream I use with it.  My face feels irritated after applying shave cream with this thing.  I think I&#x27;ll use it to remove rust from metal parts in my shop.</li>
    <li> For the money you can&#x27;t buy a better brush.  I own silver tipped badger hair burshes that cost over $125.00 and they are really not that much better than this little brush.  It gets the job done and is a very pleasant brush to use.  It has a cheap wooden handle but it holds up very well.  The bristles are soft and absorbent. What else do you want?</li>
    <li> The bristles are a little prickley and they tend to fall out when I am mixing my shaving soap but other than that it is a very good brush. REALLY needs a holder though. It takes in a lot of water or soap.</li>
    <li> It works, it&#x27;s a brush, it&#x27;s going to build a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with comments made by other buyers.  The brush definitely has a wet dog smell to it for the first few weeks.  The smell is gone from mine now but that&#x27;s not the only issue.  As others mentioned, the brush constantly sheds hair into the lather.  Mine is about 4 months old now, it was used almost exclusively during that time and it continues to shed hair.  It won&#x27;t be long before larger chunks of the brush work out of the head from losing so many bristles.  For the price, i suppose it&#x27;s okay but I won&#x27;t recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent value, and quite usable.  I bought it as my first badger hair brush, and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  I would recommend it as a first brush for those becoming acquainted with wet shaving, or as a travel brush.  It shed for the first several uses, but the last five or so shaves, it has preformed wonderfully.</li>
    <li> It took a couple of shaves to break it in, but it&#x27;s hardly scratchy at all, and it&#x27;s only lost maybe 5 bristles in three shaves, I&#x27;d expect it to stop pretty soon. Great lather, highly recommend to new shavers or someone looking for a cheap replacement or backup. You&#x27;d have to pay 2-3 times more to get something much better.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush... Been at it for about 2 months now and I think it&#x27;s great! Not losing many hairs, especially after the first few shaves. Just don&#x27;t beat it up and dry it properly and it should last for a long time. No funky smell from mine like a lot of people said...I think they just didn&#x27;t dry it properly.</li>
    <li> This is the first shaving brush I have ever used, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was my last! It takes a few months of every other day use to really break in. Once its broken in, however, its VERY soft and just a great brush to use. It can be over soft for loading, but I don&#x27;t mind that. If you want pretty, this ain&#x27;t your brush, but if you just want a brush that works and is a joy to use, Its an awesome deal. I might even buy a spare someday!</li>
    <li> The brush has great water retention, and lathers wonderfully. I did not have any loose bristles fall from the brush.  High quality for little money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a month since I got mine, and it&#x27;s still pretty held together. Some hairs are starting to come out even after taking care of it and hanging it up to dry. Not the best brush out there, but it&#x27;s great for a beginning brush and will last for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d still be using this only a maid in a hotel evidently decided her husband or her legs would be better off using it than I would. Good thing the brush was inexpensive.  That said, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; but very good value. The bristles may or may not be badger but they work well and are well adhered to the handle. It whips up a good head of soap and doesn&#x27;t get too bogged down or stiff with soap residue nor does it shed much after a day or so. The handle itself fits well in your hand and has decent weight.  Given the rather ridiculous price of many other brushes, this one is great. If you&#x27;re not out to make a fashion statement to your mirror or your spouse I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the one to get.  Update- the bristles all fell out, really? However I got some epoxy at the hardware store, evidently something Tweezerman should have used and put it back together.</li>
    <li> This was my first shaving brush.  I ordered this on October of 2009.  The brush is still working well.  It has not lost too many bristles.  It was honestly a little rough at first, but I used some hair conditioner to soften it up and have been happy with it ever since.  Should my current one ever die out, I will gladly order a Tweezerman again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 16-JUL-2012): Nearly three years later and the brush is still holding up strong to everyday use with next to no loss of bristles.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter brush. After this wears out I will buy the better grade of badger brush as this brush definately makes a better shave. My old boar brush was tossed after using this. Highly recomend.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush when I first started shaving with double edge razors.  I opened up the box, and the smell about knocked me over.  I don&#x27;t know if a Badger is anything like a Skunk, but it sure smells like one.  I soaked the brush over night in pure bleach, which helped a bit, but still smelled bad to me.  I was all into shaving the old way, but I soon realized that using a good gel shave cream and my hand, is the best way to go.  To get the best shave ever, shave with the grain with the gel, then go back and shave with some shave secret in the other direction.  I love shaving with a double edge blade, but I tried the soap and brush, and it is not for me.  I get a closer shave without it, and less irritation.</li>
    <li> The smell of this brush is so foul, you will need fight the urge to vomit.  Seriously, it&#x27;s terrible.  Its kind of a musky, dead animal smell. Spend a couple extra bucks on a different brand.  Thank you Amazon for being good about this product return!</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d be4 quoted date.  Quality of brush is not what I expected for the price I paid.  Looking for a better brush.</li>
    <li> I like how it looks and it lathers very well.   Just like most badger brushes, it did initially have a small smell for the first two or three days and a hair or two sheds every month.</li>
    <li> ... what more could you ask for.  I&#x27;m definitely not an expert, this is the one and only shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others, but hey, it works! Builds up a nice lather and gets it onto my face... I&#x27;ve used it regularly for about 2 months now and it&#x27;s holding up nicely; no hair loss, no damage to the wooden handle, holding its shape, etc., etc., etc.  As I write this review, it&#x27;s selling for $10.25 (I paid $11.52) I would have been equally pleased with it at twice the price!  April 2015 Update Still going strong almost 5yrs later! Yes, It now has lost a hair or two, but then again, so have I!</li>
    <li> This brush is a good value. I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone serious about shaving. The difference between slapping on some canned foam with your hand and lathering up some good shave soap with a badger brush is like night and day. You&#x27;ll get a much smoother shave whether you&#x27;re using a safety razor or a disposable. I&#x27;ve used both. The quality of this brush seems to be a step above many others in its price range. Only a couple downsides. First, being new, a badger brush doesn&#x27;t smell great. I let mine soak and cleaned it up with my shaving soap. Although the brush has a somewhat strong scent it won&#x27;t transfer to your face, so don&#x27;t worry ;) After a few shaves the scent dissipates. Also I&#x27;ve been using mine for about a month and it has lost a few stray bristles. Nothing much and it still has a full head of hair on it and I lose maybe one hair a week, shaving once daily.    Something to keep in mind, if you get a badger brush you&#x27;re gonna want some good shave soap &amp; a stand. Although the brush will stand on its handle, it&#x27;s best to shake it out and hang it upside down to dry better. If I were to eventually upgrade my current shaving set I&#x27;d consider a more expensive brush, but I&#x27;ve been very happy with my purchase and would recommend this as an excellent \\&quot;starter brush\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Received this brush a few weeks ago as my first foray into DE shaving.  This brush is really great for the money.  Slight Roadkill scent when first opened, especially wet, but I just cleaned it with shampoo, and in a week, can&#x27;t even tell it smelled bad.  This makes a great lather, and I don&#x27;t even use a bowl.  I just wet my brush, put a pea size amount of Proraso cream on, and lather it up on my face.  Some other reviewers complained of shedding hair, but I have not seen any noticeable amount of hair loss from this nice little brush.</li>
    <li> This brush was the cheapest badger brush I could find on amazon. And for very good reason it may be badger hair but its extremely uncomfortable and prickly. It holds a small amount of water and cannot create very much lather, probably because it is very loosely packed with hair. I quickly moved on to a brush costing a few times more but it was WELL worth the extra money. Do yourself a favor and skip this brush as a \\&quot;starter\\&quot; and go right for a middle priced brush. Much better brushes including boar brushes can be had for a little more.</li>
    <li> Nice bush but even though I hang the brush up after each use the wood handle showed serious signs of cracking after few months.</li>
    <li> Needed to be thoroughly cleaned in soapy water (though I&#x27;ve read this is standard on all badger brushes - otherwise they smell like wet badger!) A great buy though. Most Badger brushes are $50+, and I&#x27;m sure they are more luxurious, but this one makes a great lather quickly and won&#x27;t break the bank. Mine lost a few hairs at first, but hasn&#x27;t lost any in the past few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT - downgrading to 4 stars - still recommended at this price, but started loosing hairs again after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush is pretty good, but not the best I&#x27;ve owned.  It is much more prickly on my skin than the one I replaced.  However, I had to replace my old one because it consistently lost bristles and began losing them in big chunks at a time.  This one appears to be more sturdy and hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles, yet.  It was the best price I found for a brush with badger hair bristles.  It looks good; the wood handle is smooth and finished nicely.  All-in-all, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I should have known what I was getting into by spending so little on a brush, but it is my first wet shave brush and I didn&#x27;t want to make a major investment before I knew I was going to stick with it. On the first shave I removed as much beard hair as brush hairs. After about 6 or 7 uses it still loses about 3 hairs per shave. It does a decent job of working up lather, but I don&#x27;t expect the brush to last long if it continues at this rate. Thankfully I only paid $11 for it.</li>
    <li> On receiving the brush I rinsed it a few times in warm water after gently applying shaving cream foam to the bristles to clean out the manufacturing oils. I had to return the first brush since it started loosing bristles during the first few shaves and bristle loss only got worse during the third and fourth use. I am pleased to note that Amazon responded immediately, the customer representative was effective and I got a replacement brush sent to me.    The pros.- pretty cheap compared to the rest of similar brushes in the market. A great starter brush, it lathers soap/shaving cream well, retains water well and the bristles are stiff enough for a good shave. A good starter bush.  The cons.- build quality could be better. This brush could be a winner with a large percentage of first time purchaser market if the manufacturers do the 10% needed to address the quality issues. These quality issues make this product a 50-50 instead of a winner.   That being said, if you buy and the bristles come out during the first few uses, return it and ask for a replacement and be sure to add your comment to this board so that the manufacturer knows what word-of-mouth and reviews are critically appraising the product quality. Make sure that you tell them to send a product return label for free shipping. You shouldn&#x27;t have to pay for returning a product that is not performing as promised. When the manufacturers get sufficient numbers back, they will need to reconsider their manufacturing practices.  NOTE - A few bristles are coming out of the second brush but no where near the quantity that fell out of the first.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a temporary fix for my boyfriend and sadly it was not even that. He said it doesn&#x27;t hold water like a good wet shaving brush should and the handle is very small. It is only $11 lost, but still kinda sad. Oh well, I tried.</li>
    <li> This brush applies my lather very well, although the base of the actual brush feels like it might be too close to the tip, it&#x27;s tricky to squeeze out the last of that super smooth lather.     Other reviews have noted the lack of durability. I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month now, and I only have lost a few bristles, but I can definitely feel how it may fall apart sooner rather than later.  But then again, for this price, that&#x27;s not a surprise.    The brush is definitely not the best, but it&#x27;s MUCH better than the synthetics, and it&#x27;s much cheaper than almost all other badger hair brushes. If you have the money, go for a best badger hair brush, but if you don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t waste your time with synthetics, get this one. You may have to replace it in a few months, but still is a great starter brush.</li>
    <li> Does a very goo job. Holds the shaving soap well and dried easily.  There are more expensive brushes but I can&#x27;t imagine them working any better.</li>
    <li> Great brush for practically nothing! Holds water well and makes a good lather. It&#x27;s no silver tip badger brush but I&#x27;ll stick with plain ol&#x27; badger hair for cheap cheap cheap.</li>
    <li> For the price I&#x27;m happy with the brush.  It does shed hairs initially, but the shedding slows down after several uses.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for face lathering, it&#x27;s a bit too stiff for that, but it bowl lathers very nicely, and I&#x27;ve had no real issues to complain about. Overall all a good beginner brush for those looking to get into wetshaving.</li>
    <li> Received this shaving brush as a Christmas gift, i.as very pleased by the quality. the hairs form a very dense brush, that is firm yet soft to the touch. did not lose a bunch of stray hairs after using, like cheaper brushes tend to,.</li>
    <li> Badger is best, and this is stiff enough to work well for soaps and soft enough to know it&#x27;s badger. The wet hair smell goes away quick with use, and stopped shedding hair after about 2 weeks.  Not a large diameter brush, but then for the price...  After use I wash it, then shake excess water out, then buff the hair against the back of my other hand to help dry (which helps it fluff a little) then I hang to dry. I&#x27;ve been using it as a travel brush since I bought a best badger for daily use, but this is better for soap as it&#x27;s a little stiffer.  Hands down great brush and much better value then the boar brushes available in the pharmacies around the country.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product - I got this, my new shaving soap, and my nice razor together and proceeded to mix up the lather for the first time ever, and the bundle of hairs popped off in the middle of my shave. It worked really well while it lasted, but it didn&#x27;t even last one shave so... yeah. You really weren&#x27;t very careful with this one, Tweezerman. Everyone should be aware of this possibility when you buy one of these, because I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s reported this. For such an integral part of my kit, I&#x27;ll pay another 10 bucks for something that will last longer than one shave.</li>
    <li> Good price for a badger brush. It looses a lot of hair.  It&#x27;s lost so much I think I can see the difference in the fullness of the brush.</li>
    <li> My last brush lasted three years, but I lost it over my last trip and had to buy a new one. It is a great brush that makes lathering a joy.</li>
    <li> ok this is the 4th brush i&#x27;ve purchased in the past 5 or so years. all of the others fell apart b/c i did not know that you&#x27;re supposed to hang them upside down so that the water drips out. i just assumed that they only lasted 6 months to a year. my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this one for a couple of months now and it works like it is supposed to work. it puts lather on my face and i didn&#x27;t have to pull more than a few bucks out of my pocket. winner.</li>
    <li> So I bought this new shaving brush for my husband. He says it lathers really well. The one complaint he did have is that it has a funky smell at first when it&#x27;s wet. Smells similar to a skunk (I smelled it myself):/ After using it numerous times, the smell isn&#x27;t as bad. Would have given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t smell.</li>
    <li> Before I knew to soak the brush for a couple of minutes in warm water before each shave I was losing 3 to 5 hairs per shave. Now that I&#x27;ve learned how to use the brush, it very rarely sheds. Although this is my first brush, it does a great job.</li>
    <li> This brush really rocks. Its so much better than a boar hair brush. For so little price its a big step up in quality and performance.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great - this is the second one I&#x27;ve ordered (nothing was wrong with the first - my cats carry it away and hide it on me if I forget to put it in the cabinet).  Before these two Tweezerman&#x27;s, I had started with a cheaper brush that used to constantly shed bristles.  This one is soft and almost never loses bristles.  It&#x27;s also a great value considering many of the other good brushes are twice the price or more.</li>
    <li> Only used it a couple times, but I am absolutely LOVING this brush. It holds the perfect amount of water to make great lathers. It&#x27;s much softer than my boar brush and feels great on the skin. I HIGHLY recommend this anyone!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> It smelled awful even after several washings with shampoo, and it lost about 20 hairs every time I used it. It lathered just fine, I just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. For a few dollars more, I decided to purchase an Omega brush, and I expect it to perform much better. If you don&#x27;t mind the smell and the hair loss, go for it. Not for me though.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to replace a dinky Art of Shaving brush included in one of their starter kits, and I&#x27;m very pleased. The brush is large, holds water and shaving cream well, does not shred (beyond a few stray hairs in the first couple of uses), and does not retain any odor. It feels great on my skin, too. I would advise anyone purchasing this brush to make sure they shake as much water out after shaving as possible, and to hand it upside down for storage. Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> As some other have pointed, the brush does loose some bristles intially but it did stop after a while. The only things I did not like about the bursh -  The handle is very small. And the brush is very thick and holds up a lot of foam from getting to the face. Otherwise, it is a great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> I have a thick stubble and coarse hair. The bristles on this brush began falling out immediately. I had to discontinue use otherwise I would have been forced to stop using it by the bald spots. Nice novelty to have to show off in the bathroom but its not practical. Especially if you need to shave before work. Maybe a good toy for a man who is retired and has no where to be in the morning. But for the &amp;#34;rest of us&amp;#34; 8-5ers.... not good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this brush and I&#x27;ve been using it daily now for a month.  It whips up a great lather and I&#x27;ve tried it with Taylor&#x27;s Eton College cream, and a concoction of regular old soap mixed with Kiss My Face shaving cream and a couple drops of glycerin which both work wonderfully with it.  All that said, it isn&#x27;t the softest badger brush around, comparing it to one I bought for my father a few years back (although that one cost over 3 times as much) and it is pretty small too, so don&#x27;t expect miracles out of it.  For the price, it&#x27;s tough to beat and so far seems pretty well made although it has lost a hair here and there.  Not really a big deal to me.  It holds a good amount of water within the hair after soaking in a hot bowl full for making a great warm lather after a shake or two.</li>
    <li> This is my first brush. I like that it has the wood handle, and is fairly soft. I did lose a few bristles the first time I used it, but have been following the instructions as posted by a previous reviewer and have had no problems. I would recommend this, especially for a first time user like myself.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to go back to wet shaving, and i also decided to buy a new shaving brush, seeing as my old one has been sitting for about5 or so years, and this tweezermans fit the bill as far as affordability goes...i read some of the reviews and it was stated it had a horrid smell when wet, they were right, but after a couple uses its almost non detectable......overall good performance for such an inexpensive brush, good lather, feels good on the face......i&#x27;m sure there better brushes, but for the price you cant go wrong...</li>
    <li> sheds but functional- best brush under $20</li>
    <li> this brush has great bristles, comparable to brushes 3 or 4 times the price, but after 6 weeks of use the handle fell off.  I thought at that price it seemed to good to be true - and I was right.  this is a penny-wise pound-foolish purchase.</li>
    <li> Cost effective. Has lasted for years with no signs of letting up. I&#x27;ve bought many as gifts since I purchased for myself.</li>
    <li> I got this as my first brush with my first safety razor. It has lasted quite a long time. I wouldn&#x27;t know how it would compare to more expensive brands, but I like it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to traditional wet-shaving like I am, this is the perfect brush to start off. It&#x27;s not expensive and it gets the job done. Since it&#x27;s animal hair, it may have an odor to it initially. What I did was soak the brush in a bowl of water with some dish washing liquid for an hour or so. You may need to do it twice but it worked for me. That goes for any animal hair brush.</li>
    <li> I have had zero issues with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;It retains water nicely and for the price it really is hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;There are nicer ones and if you wanted to upgrade from a boar bristle brush this is not a bad choice that doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> The brush works well. The handle is a little small but has not been a problem using. The soap loads well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best brush out there in terms of softness, and it occasionally loses hairs while I&#x27;m using it (though not more than 1-2 per shave), but for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it. It&#x27;s comfortable enough to use and sure beats using shaving cream from a can. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re on a budget, or if you&#x27;re looking for a \\&quot;starter\\&quot; or travel brush that might get a little beaten up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my brush for a little over 2 months now and it&#x27;s actually the only one I&#x27;ve bought. YES, it does loose a few hairs the first few times around, YES, you do need to buy a stand for it, and YES, it does smell like a wet dog the first time you get it wet and it feels a little spiky on the face. But those problems are not permanent; the brush gets better with each use and it definitely gets the job done. I say, if you can afford a better quality brush get it, if you&#x27;re on a budget and want something that just works then add this brush to your cart.</li>
    <li> worked for a bit; then it fell apart.. the brush from the handle. glued it back together and works well ( assuming it doesnt fall apart again )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it works well enough but i have to take off 2 stars for quality .. it shouldn&#x27;t fall apart after a month of use. i hope this is just a defect not a manufacturing issue</li>
    <li> i&#x27;d never used a shaving brush like this and i wanted to try it out.  i think it did a decent job, though i&#x27;ve never used any other one, so i can&#x27;t really compare it to anything.  personally, i ended up going back to an electric razor.  it just takes too much time and effort to do a classic shave, in my opinion.  but maybe i didn&#x27;t give it enough of a fair attempt.  i only tried it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> For the price this Tweezerman shaving brush can&#x27;t be beat. The Badger hair bristles are stiff enough to deliver a nice lather of shaving soap without being too stiff and hurting the face, or too soft and just smearing the shaving soap.    I have now used this brush a couple times and I haven&#x27;t noticed the loss of a single hair from the brush. The finish on the wood handle is holding up really nice and the hairs are easy to clean. I haven&#x27;t noticed any odd odors some have complained about.    Care of the brush is pretty straightforward. The manufacturer recommends rinsing in warm water and drying either hanging it upside down or laying it on its side. You do NOT want to dry this brush upright on its handle or you will likely see problems some have noted in their reviews here, such as loss of hairs and premature wear on the wood handle&#x27;s finish.     When I use this brush I grip the bulb of the wood handle. I do not grip the back of the handle. I believe this gives better control over the brush and helps maintain the integrity of the Badger hair knot. When cleaning the Badger hairs, rinse out all the shaving soap under warm water. There is no need to rinse under hot water which will only serve to weaken the glue holding the Badger hair knot to the wood. I lay the brush on its side to air dry, which is recommended by the manufacturer (as well as hanging upside down). Doing this keeps water from soaking into and sitting on the wood base to which the Badger hair knot is glued and thereby causing premature separation of the knot from the wood.     Overall, with proper care, this shaving brush looks like it will give me great service for a long time to come. For the money this is excellent!</li>
    <li> Works the shave soap into a fine lather.  I would have given it 5 stars however it lost a fair amount of bristles when I first started using it.</li>
    <li> This is my third shave whisk.  My first, from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, lasted about 6 years and then was accidentally left at a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second, I forget where it was sourced, gave up chunks of bristles within a month, and was completely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, my third, has been durable.  I&#x27;ve had it for 6 years, and lost no bristles.  I don&#x27;t hang it from a rack like it should, but I rinse it well and shake out the rinse water after every use.  I have lost maybe one bristle per year, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristle head is well formed, and it creates a thick lather.  The brush itself is soft to the touch, but can dab foam through my beard, or spread it along a clean line when just trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this brush is excellent.  I would recommend this brush to anyone wishing to whip up their own shaving cream in the mornings.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;Badger bristles really ARE superior the the boar brushes provided in most \\&quot;starter\\&quot; kits&lt;br /&gt;better lather and not as sloppy..&lt;br /&gt;if you are a wet shaver you need one of these</li>
    <li> Creates a nice lather and it&#x27;s cheap.I have noticed some of the badger hair fall out, this might be because it&#x27;s new.</li>
    <li> This product is well made and does a great job mixing and spreading lather/soap onto your face it does however have a strong unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> for the buck, it is fantastic, giving you a great shave. highly recommend it to other guys who want a great shave.</li>
    <li> Edited: I have been using the brush for about two months now. It still works great. I lose a couple of hairs when I shave with it. I don&#x27;t know if that is normal two months into using it. It still blows the board head brushes away.  I upgraded to a better brush. This brush is still a good low cost brush to start out with. I just wanted something better as my shaving education has progressed.  This is a great little brush. It cost me about thirteen dollars w/shipping. I have a boars head brush as well and this blows the boars head brush away by leaps and bounds. I am sure I will purchase other badger hair shaving brushes. This is a great low price alternative to boars hair brushes which cost about the same. It lathers up well and doesn&#x27;t take long to build a thick creamy lather. Don&#x27;t let the price fool. Its a decent quality brush. Its good for a beginner to wet shaving like me, who is looking for an inexpensive solution.   Just rinse the brush out thoroughly and gently towel dry it. Let it rest on it side to dry if you do not have a stand for your razor and shaving brush. I usually let it soak in the sink with my shaving bowl as I shower. That warms up the brush and provides a warm sooth lather to the face. I use real shaving-shaving cream and vanderhagen shaving soap. Both are great low cost products and I don&#x27;t have any issues with them.   Great brush for the price. Good for beginners.</li>
    <li> I have been using an Omega Boar Hair brush, and while it does a great job whipping up later (Proraso / Soap Puck) it did not seem to do a great job with applying the lather to the face or lightly scrubbing/prepping the hair for shaving.   The Tweezermans brush exceeded my expectations in lather application and provided great face prep as well.  I don&#x27;t think i will go back to boars hair brushes again.</li>
    <li> this is a much nicer brush than you will pick up at Walmart when you buy the soap/brush combination. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush on May 11,2011. Today is September 14,2011. Today is the first day that the brush felt broken in. THe brush hasn&#x27;t shed any hairs since I bought it. It took some getting used because it was harsh. I have had the ones that fall apart . This isn&#x27;t one of them. Well made.</li>
    <li> Apart from being a bit poky on the skin, its a good brush and gets a good lather. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these for the past 2 years. Like any brush it occasionally sheds, but it&#x27;s performed above and beyond what I expected from a $10 brush. Aside from being a bit rough or coarse feeling, I&#x27;m not sure what I would improve on by buying something costing 6-10x as much.</li>
    <li> The tweezerman badger shaving brush is a must for those starting out in this new (old) thing called WET shaving.  At around $12.00 you can&#x27;t buy a better starter brush.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks and lots of reading to make sure I&#x27;m using it correctly, I have to say I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in this brush. I soak it in my mug (in hot water) while I shower. After the shower, I lather up to shave and it still loses bristles at a rate that I was hoping would&#x27;ve subsided by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it does do a good job working the shave cream into a warm lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I&#x27;ll try a higher rated (and unfortunately more expensive) brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with my new DE razor and shaving soap.  This is my first brush, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I like it.  It&#x27;s a great first product for somebody that&#x27;s starting out with shaving.    My only gripe about it is that some of the hairs have fallen out.  It is not even close to a point of concern, but in the shaving soap cup where you swish the brush around, there&#x27;s a few hairs in it.  It&#x27;s nothing at all to be worried about, but that is the only thing.  For the price of 12 bucks, I&#x27;d say that this product does a great job.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby... he said it felt a little stiff the first time or two he used it, but now it&#x27;s wonderful. Does not shed and feels soft during use.</li>
    <li> I bought this Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush in June 2011.  During the first week of use after a couple of shaves it fell apart although I was placing it upside down for it to dry.  I still use it without the handle but it is a bit uncomfortable.  The bristles are great but the glue was not strong enough.  I just emailed Tweezerman at their website to see what they say.  Tweezerman emailed me back and stated that I should include a note and ship the item back to them at an address they provided me (NY).  I went to the post office and for $3.00 I got a box and shipped the shaving brush with a copy of the email that they had sent me.  Shortly thereafter Tweezerman delivered a brand new brush in the box to my home.  I am very satisfied with their warranty.    The badger hair is very nice and soft.  And sure is a lot easier and better than using your hands to lather your face with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] as my first Badger hair brush. I had been using an excellent Boar bristle brush given to me by a fellow wet shaver. This brush is hands down softer and more comfortable than my old brush. The quality and volume of the lather is wonderful. The only down side I find is, I have to work at building the lather a bit longer (I use a hard milled shaving soap) but that&#x27;s just whining. I only gave this brush four stars because, being my first Badger brush I have nothing in its class to compare it too. I do think it is a great brush.</li>
    <li> Love a brush with my shaving cream</li>
    <li> Is that my hair in the drain or from the brush?  I think most of it is from the brush.</li>
    <li> I travel on business.  I am just bloody sick and tired of spending large sums on small cans of shaving cream.  So I remembered my dad, 50 years ago, using a shaving brush and soap, and I realized that shaving soap is not a cream or liquid.  Voila!  I went to WalMart and bought their shaving brush and soap.  The soap is perfectly adequate (for about $1.75), but their brush features PIG hair/fur/pubies/whatever (about $5).  Nevertheless, I went for it; how could you not? I shaved.  Feh. The brush stays wet, leaves soap trails, doesn&#x27;t do the job.  I was forlorn.  That is, until I visited MY Amazon (or, it ought to be) and found this brush.  My Dad used a badger brush.  Now I use one - this one.  It works up a lather, spreads it smoooooth, and then balances on its one foot to preen while I shave.  Best of all: when I rinse it off and shake it (the brush) a few times, it mysteriously dries.  Perfect for travel.  The TSA envies me.  Get it.  David Block</li>
    <li> Based on the price, I have to admit that I was not expecting a premium quality brush . But I was surprised when the brush head came loose from the handle and fell to the floor the third time I used it. I re-attached it with epoxy, but I am not sure that this brush is going to last very long. Currently looking for a higher quality brush.</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for a month now. The only bad thing is that it still sheds hairs when I use it, but it isn&#x27;t noticeable in the thickness of the hairs. Other than that everything is great about this brush especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Got this brush in February and have used it for 8 months with no problems.I shake it out and hang it brush down after each use and have had no problem with it losing hairs. Although I have never used any other brush, I would buy this brush again because of the price, it has done everything it is supposed to and it is well made.</li>
    <li> This brush served me very well for several months, until a few days ago. I was shaving, so naturally it was on the sink. The quality of the brush seemed good, so I was very surprised to see the handle pop off from the bristles when it hit the floor. Naturally, I didn&#x27;t throw it down, and my sink is of average height. Though I tried, there was no way I was getting that handle back together with the bristles. I can&#x27;t say that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush, after all, you do get what you pay for...just don&#x27;t drop it!</li>
    <li> When you first get this brush and add water and soap to it, it&#x27;s gonna smell like a dead badger.  But once you get passed that its good.  Very high quality.  Don&#x27;t be surprised if a few hairs fall out.  That&#x27;s normal.  Great product and this is the way everyone should shave.  Very nice and really isn&#x27;t more effort than a Mach 3 style of shaving.</li>
    <li> Some 8 months ago I took the plunge into switching from a cartage razor to a double edge setup.  Not wanting to dump a lot of money into something I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d continue to do, I purchased this brush along with the other necessities to start shaving.  I knew full well it was made in China and one of the cheapest brushes out there so my expectations were low. So far, I have been VERY pleased with the performance.  Once the brush is &#x27;broken in&#x27;, the bristles offer a great balance between water retention, stiffness and softness.  The first few times I used it I noticed 2 or 3 shed hairs and absolutely none after the first week. I told myself hat I would &#x27;upgrade&#x27; brushes if I kept up with double edge shaving but there&#x27;s no need.  I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time!</li>
    <li> Was a great brush.  10 months later and a dime size area of hair missing in the center area.  My son&#x27;s Escali still going strong which was purchased at the same time.  Tweezerman doesn&#x27;t deserve the 4.5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great brush.  I find about 1 bristle in the sink every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Never thought I would own anything with Badger hair but now I do and I love it. Great bang for the buck!!! Good work men.</li>
    <li> All I can really say is that it is decent quality for the price. I have been using it 5 times a week for a few weeks now and it has worked well. The reason I gave it a four star is due to it loosing a few hairs here and there, again, the quality for the price it excelent. It is smooth and creates a great lather. I have noticed that I get a considerably better/closer shave and use less shaving cream (CO Bigelow which is a shaving cream I believe everyone should try! It is expensive (Cheaper than Proraso) but has an amazing feel) which is amazing seeing how expensive it is!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, slightly smaller brush head than the more expensive brushes available but it&#x27;s really not a big deal. Soft and well made, the perfect travel brush. I have read all the reviews about storage after use and found that Industrial strength Velcro, applied to the handle and a horizontal surface in your shower works well. If your travels are mostly to places you&#x27;ll never see again, a simple plastic or wire hanger will suffice. Keep it clean, hang it bristles down, and get years of use for only a few dollars.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of other reviewers. I have to say I am really disappointed. I have been using the brush for two weeks solid and it leaves hairs/bristles on my face every time. It isn&#x27;t how I am storing or using this brush that is causing this either. I have a proper stand and clean it after each use. I have been shaving old school for years now and am no novice. Save your money and buy a better quality brush.</li>
    <li> This brush has worked well and lost a few hairs every use for all of its 6 uses.  It&#x27;s worked up great lather.  Great starter/travel brush to see if this is right for you.  The price for what you get is excellent.  It does have a wooden handle and I&#x27;ll see how this holds up over time since it will be soaked.  But so far so good!  From what I&#x27;ve seen the next step up is about $40 a brush.    I purchased this with the [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]] and it fit snugly.  The brush is 1\\&quot; wide at the thinnest part at the top of the handle which is exactly what the stand measured.</li>
    <li> i buy one every 5 years or so although they can go longer.&lt;br /&gt;i have brushes that cost 10 times as much but do not come close to tweezerman</li>
    <li> Not the best brush I have owned but certainly one of the very best in value - I bought it as my travel brush (I tend to lose them) and I have been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> *updated* It worked well for  a while, but after about 8 months or so the knot fell out. I ended up trying to glue it back in the handle eventually using a healthy blob of silicone seemed to do the trick. I&#x27;ve since traded up for a better brush and passed this one along to my bro who is getting started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is good to get you started, but I can see many people passing this along like I did. Good luck.</li>
    <li> This brush is an excellent value.  I bought it in December of 2008 so I&#x27;ve been using daily for 18 months with no problems.  Some of the reviewers report quality issues; first make sure you follow the following reviewer&#x27;s advice:      http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-2801-h-Mens-Shaving-Brush/product-reviews/B000G647Y8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_synop?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;showViewpoints&#x3D;0&amp;sortBy&#x3D;bySubmissionDateDescending#R197O85VZM4HS1      The reviewer describes how I&#x27;ve used my brush since day one.  I did make a brush stand out of a wire hanger, so for me a brush stand was not a hidden cost.    If you still have problems then there must be a quality control problem at the manufacturer. That would not surprise me given the price of the brush.  Knowing what I know about the brush, if I had a dud, I&#x27;d toss it and order another.  The next cheapest badger I&#x27;ve seen is over twice the price of this one, so I think it would be worth the risk.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of cheap brushes through the years...but I would say this is my first really \\&quot;nice\\&quot; brush. I don&#x27;t feel compelled to purchase a more expensive or exotic brush..It does a wonderful job...and at a working-mans price. I gave these as part of a wet shave \\&quot;kit\\&quot; I put together as a Christmas gift for my sons and a friend of theirs. Nice brush..money well spent!</li>
    <li> Too Small and it shed too much.  Cheaply made - the laminate on the handle started coming off.  Try a Omega Syntec instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush based upon other reviews and am very happy with my purchase.  The brush is soft as can be, now that it is broken in, and lathers very well.  Maybe an expensive brush is worth the money, but this one is just fine for me.</li>
    <li> Builds a solid lather quickly and easily, I&#x27;ve never used a $70-$100 brush but this thing is much better than my old boar bristle brush, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and no complaints.</li>
    <li> Recommend this brush to anyone willing to shave right. Great quality, seems to last a while. Using it with my Merkur blade. Get one.</li>
    <li> Compared to other basic brushes this brush delivers&lt;br /&gt;superior lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coats the skin evenly, wonderfully&lt;br /&gt;Minimal shedding&lt;br /&gt;Holds soap well, only need to build lather once&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only step up from this would be a bigger brush, or one&lt;br /&gt;with more refinement like bone or silver handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the minimal brush myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is worth at least double the price.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year on the brush has begun to peel badly on the wood, the varnish is too thin and it is now&lt;br /&gt;peeling and getting mildew in the wood....</li>
    <li> this brush lathers great right out of the box. I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s better than other badger hair brushes because I&#x27;ve never tried any other ones, but it definitely beats a boar&#x27;s bristle brush that hasn&#x27;t been &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34; yet!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the Badger brush, and at first my face was having a lot of allergic reaction to it. My face turned red where i lathered so i thought maybe badger was not for me, but after the first time. For some ODD reason the bristles got softer so i thought of one thing. I didn&#x27;t let the brush soak in the water long enough and VOILA that was my problem. The lathering was so much better on my face than the boar brush, because it&#x27;s a lot softer. I bought OMEGA boar brush, but the stiffness was overwhelming. You have to understand that i don&#x27;t shave often so i need to buy a brush that breaks in faster. I LOVE BOTH BOAR AND BADGER BRUSH, but the second time i used it, the lathering was really good, although i still need to learn how to lather the soap better since it became too watery. I&#x27;D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush twice now. It&#x27;s amazing how comfortably sharp the tips of the bristles are. I can feel it exfoliating without feeling like it&#x27;s scratching my face up. Several bristles fell out on the first usage, I guess it was just breaking in. The handle is glossy smooth, which made me have to grip harder when mixing shaving lather and cramped my hand just a bit in the process. But all of this is new to me. The shave itself wasn&#x27;t perfect either, so I&#x27;m clearly leaning and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better with both the shaving and lathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention these sort-of \\&quot;negative\\&quot; aspects to give anyone else who&#x27;s as new to brush/DE shaving an idea of what they may expect on their first usage, and to not worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with the [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shaving Soap, Ultra Sensitive Skin 5.2 oz (147 g)]] and on my first attempt, I swished it around gently enough to cover the top of all the bristles, then I swished the brush around in an empty cup with a dab of water. I created so much foam I was able to do 3 passes and I still had plenty of shaving cream lather left over. I&#x27;m not sure if I was able to get so much because of the quality of the brush bristles or because of the Proraso.</li>
    <li> In short this brush didn&#x27;t even last me a year.  I liked it when it was not broken, worked really well.  This was my first brush, so it may have been improper use and/or care as others are saying of us novices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying a second one now to replace my broken one and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Good brush. I will get another when my current one wears out someday.  2017 Update. The brush is still going strong. I&#x27;m ordering a second one so I can put it in my Dopp kit.</li>
    <li> I personally enjoy/prefer the brush and cake over canned shaving cream.  If you have to shave you should at least get some pleasure out of it.  If you have looked in the various mall stores for a good shaving brush they tend to run between $30-$50 for a Badger or Boar, or mix bristle brush, more if you want a top quality 100% badger bristle.  This one at $15 is a steal.  Yes you can pay more, but why?  Especially, if as I do you rotate your brushes, it can be a pricey undertaking.  I have had this particular brush for about a year now and can attest that it has held up well and got the job done.</li>
    <li> Very well worth the price. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and it&#x27;s still in good shape. There&#x27;s minimal shedding of hair. I wonder if other reviewers complaining of shedding have gotten a defected brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used a stand for it yet. I just dry it on it&#x27;s side on top of a towel, then turn it brush-side-up when it&#x27;s mostly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with Proraso shaving cream. Quite refreshing!</li>
    <li> This brush feels great brushing the lather frok the Old Bond Street on my face. Go for the real thing and leave the fake stuff for toys. After 2 years hair is in good shape as well as the handle. I use this alot as I have to stay clean shaven for work and I expect it to last several more years. I hear you are not supposed to set these upside down on the handle after using so they will dry good. I roll mine in a couple paper towels after each use and put Iit back in the drawer. Works perfect. Handle still looks great and hair is straight. Highly recommended for someone who has to shave alot. Don&#x27;t make shaving a chore, make it enjoyable.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY !!! This is just waste of money, first time use and brush is falling in part, black color is coming from the brush, it not deserve the single star.</li>
    <li> I decided to use a brush again after many years without one. Tweezerman fulfilled my needs well. Low cost, durable and comfortable. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I read reviews of brushes before buying this one as my first; one year later I can not find anything to complain about.  For the price it would be fine if it only lasted a year, but it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> HAppy with this brush so far. LEarning more about higher end brushes.BUt this is a great value and starter brush.MUst hang brush in a stand to dry to get best use of brush.  GOodbye canned shaving creams and $$$ MOck 3 blades, hello old school shaving and $$ back in our pockets along with a superior shave. PReping face with lather and brush is a key part of old school shaving. DOnt skimp and be patiant.  YOu will be looking foward to shaving rather than hating it..  BAdabing..</li>
    <li> The thing was cheap and it works well. Some of the brissles are a bit frizzled but it still works well after four months of use.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a nice brush.  I went from a Burma Shave I bought at the drug store which was boar hair to this gem.  I have been sorry that I haven&#x27;t shaved this way all of my life.  The bristles are soft and seem very sturdy.  The handle is a very nice shape and easily held.  The hairs hold water perfectly.     Don&#x27;t hesitate to try!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase as some reviews claimed they had hairs fall out or the brush was harsh... I&#x27;d like to share that the brush is nice and soft and after using it several times since I&#x27;ve received it I have yet to have any hairs come out. I&#x27;ll note for those new to these brushes it is animal so it has a wet animal smell to it which goes away more and more after each use. I&#x27;ve read borax will get rid of this very quickly or you can use shampoo/handsoap which I did and it got rid of most of it immediately. Holds plenty of water and dries quickly after rinse &amp; a couple shakes.</li>
    <li> I just purchased a Tweezerman Badger Shaving Brush and have used it 3 times. I know it&#x27;s not an expensive brush but it smells like week old Road Kill. Hours after I shave I can hardly stand to go into my bathroom.I think it&#x27;s my first and last experiance with a brush! My wife just told me she thought a skunk was outside! LOL</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item three times now. It&#x27;s small but does it&#x27;s job as well as I could&#x27;ve expected. There is the initial shedding that happens upon the first few uses but after a bit it generally stops. Purchase of a stand would help in terms of procuring a longer lifespan. Bristles weren&#x27;t super soft but not terribly abrasive either. Aside from that, again, not a bad product.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this brush for my son, with hopes of getting him interested in wet shaving.  It has become part of my brush assortment (7). This is the least expensive brush I own and does a GREAT job whether used in bowl (scuttle) lathering or face lathering. The bristles are soft on the face yet firm with a bit of backbone. It is an all around low cost work horse of a brush.  The fit and finish on mine is \\&quot;fairly poor\\&quot;.  It had one crack in it when it arrived and has developed another crack since, both go into the handle from the ferrule area. Additionally the manufacturer left the base of the handle in a rough sawn condition and simply varnished over it without sanding it out.  I&#x27;ve often thought that I probably own the ugliest Tweezerman out there... I could of easily returned it to Amazon but I kept it anyway.  Glad for it, because I value this little beasty!!  I take it when traveling and do simple face lathering shaves with it using shaving cream (Proraso or Speick).  Works great.  If it came up lost, I wouldn&#x27;t loose sleep over it.  I would certainly buy another Tweezerman to replace it.  It&#x27;s a great little brush for under 14 bucks! Look elsewhere if you want to purchase \\&quot;eye candy\\&quot; or a brush that might give you \\&quot;high end\\&quot; product self-satisfaction or bragging rights. This little guy is simply GREAT FOR WHAT IT IS... so I still gave it 5 stars... even though mine is kind of an ugly duck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, so it won&#x27;t be the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; brush you can buy. If you are starting out with wet shaving, then this brush is a good start. Once you figure out if wet shaving is for you, just get a better brush. I, for one, prefer the stiffness of this brush as i helps exfoliate and lift up some ingrown hairs  Edit: The first brush worked ok for about a year and a half and now just sheds non-stop. I ordered a second brush and it seems that they simply glued the badgers anus to a wood handle. I guess that I&#x27;ll be upgrading.</li>
    <li> I started using a shaving brush years ago.  I discovered that a shaving brush works the lather into my whiskers much better than finger tips and provides more uniform coverage for a more comfortable shave with any of the razors I&#x27;ve used.  Unfortunately my old brush started loosing bristles after years of service so I was eager to find a replacement.  Happily the Tweezeman shaving brush has been able to step up and fully fill my need.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush for $12. It shed like a mofo when I first bought it, but mainly because it&#x27;s OVER-PACKED with badger bristle. Is it annoying? Not to me.. I payed $12.... and I received a brush with almost 2x bristles of brushes I saw at Art of Shaving for 3x the price and same quality hair... so no I have NO complaints. After a few months the shedding stopped, I still get maybe 1 loose bristle every once in a while but nothing serious. After 3 years of constant use and abuse, my brush is beautiful. No mold, no excessive bristle loss, creates a beautiful and full lather on a drop of a proraso shaving cream, and still fuller than the brushes sold as new from shaving stores I hit up to window shop. SO, will I tell you to buy this?? HELL YES!!!!! For the price it can&#x27;t be beat. Don&#x27;t worry about the shedding it stops and your brush still works and looks great after.</li>
    <li> Lost about 2 dozen bristles on the first shave and I found the brush extremely hard. I only used this once and went back to my Van Der Hagen that I bought as part of a $7 shave kit at Walmart. Shown here:[[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]] Soap in Van Der Hagen kit is great as well. Bowl is small but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Really 4 stars, read on.  Just having started on DE shaving on november 2011, my first set of purchases includes this brush. (Merkur 180 long razor, 10 pack of merkur razor blades and proraso shaving soap).  This brush feels great on the skin and gets you lathered up exquisitely. On my first lather I take about 2 minutes, because I just love the exfoliating feeling I get, kinda like the feeling you get when you go to a spa. I usually don&#x27;t skimp on taking some extra time lathering up and brushing my face with this. I also use this even when I am not shaving, for a quick face rinse (with soap of course), when I am going out or have some company. I am sure the smoothness and lack of irritation on my skin has a lot to due with the brush. First couple of uses it does smell a little odd, but I like the smell and it goes away quickly with a couple of shaves. Also hairs do fall off initially and throughout the life of the brush, but it seems to diminish as you go. About a hair per shave I&#x27;d say, which isn&#x27;t very much.  With that said, this isn&#x27;t a bad beginner brush, in fact it does its job perfectly. You could probably keep this for a long time. And if I we&#x27;re more frugal I probably would. However, I can tell there are better brushes, albeit at a higher price.  In short, best brush for beginners and best bang for buck. If you wan&#x27;t better quality, you will have to pay double or even triple. I will be purchasing a more expensive brush in the future, but I really don&#x27;t need to for now.  Happy shaving gentlemen!</li>
    <li> This is a good brush to use when you&#x27;re getting started because it&#x27;s cheap.  If you choose to go back to your previous shaving routine, you&#x27;re only out $12.  But once you decide to stick with wet shaving, I would recommend getting another brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this brush for about two months, and it is still shedding hair all over my face.  I dig 2 or 3 hairs from this brush out of my freshly-applied shaving cream every morning.</li>
    <li> I followed the \\&quot;experts\\&quot; advice but this brush continues to lose bristles from shave one. I just started \\&quot;real shaving\\&quot; after years of cartridges and $$$ and canned foam. Despite extra care while whipping up lather, I found my soap, my mug, and my \\&quot;mug\\&quot; covered in badger bristles. Tried gently rinsing the brush, light shaking it, and being very gentle but still ended up covered in bristles. After using the brush and following the expert&#x27;s advice on rinsing and shaking, and hanging it up to dry, handle end up, the brush now looks like a rounded shrub, with stray bristles sticking out the sides at odd angles. Despite the brush, though, I had a very enjoyable experience shaving with my new DE razor, getting a nice, smooth, close shave. My better half noticed the difference immediately! I am hooked!  Now, on to find a good quality brush for my next shave....and I never ever thought I would look forward to shaving!</li>
    <li> Not real fond of this brush, It is to small or my hand is to big</li>
    <li> I bought this brush when I was introduced to wet shaving, so, it&#x27;s my first brush, so, I probably have a sort of sentimental attachment to it. With that being said though, it really is just a great brush for the price. I would recommend this to anyone who wet shaves OR as a reasonably priced gift for someone!</li>
    <li> This is a great little badger hair brush.  I also have a boars hair brush and the difference is night and day.  The badger hair makes a quick and thick lather.  Feels softer on the face.  The only down side is you have to clean it real good when you first get it.  It does come with a rather funky odor.  But after that it is great.  Best brush I have so far.  So far it has held up well.  There have been about a dozen hairs that fell out but guess that is to be expected of just about any brush.  I am glad I got this brush and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am a light shaver, 2-3 times a week.  A 12-pack of Mach-3 lasts me about 1.5 years, no kidding.  So when I went to buy some more, I was really shocked by the \\&quot;new\\&quot; price and spending that much for blades.  I did a little research, and found out that Dad&#x27;s way is actually the 2nd closest shave you can get next to a straight razor.  I am not ready for a straight razor, we learn to crawl before we run marathons.  This is my first brush.  I did not want to spend a lot because I was not sure I was going to stick with this method.  Guess what?  I am never going to anything else.  This method is great!  I bought a Merkur razor, Gilette 7 o&#x27;clock blades, Proraso shaving cream, and Proraso pre/after shaving cream.  I wet the brush, shake off excess water, swish the brush around in the cup, and it takes me about 30 seconds to get a good lather going.  I rinse the brush under warm, running water, squeeze the bristles through my forefinger and thumb, shake off any excess, and hang it upside down in the brush/razor holder I bought.  I have absolutely no problems with bristles falling out or wood cracking.  Being a newbie, I do not have other brushes to compare this experience to.  I expect the brush to last, at least 3-5 years.  I am considering buying the Parker brush for comparison. I really like the Proraso products.  I like the facial sensation the shaving cream gives.  I did use the pre/after shave cream before lathering up for a couple of weeks, but found no difference between using it beforehand and not using it.  Results may differ with heavy shavers.  As an aftershave cream, I wish I had known about it before--alcohol-free and conditions the skin.  I receive compliments on how smooth my face feels even hours after I have shaved. I will buy one of those sample packs to see if there is a better blade for my face.  I use this blade about three times and then flip it to the other side for 3 more shaves.  I bought everything here on Amazon for a good price and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> This was my first shaving brush and I would recommend this as a starter brush for any beginner looking into getting into wet shaving.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  I have used mine daily for the past five months and it has held up well.  Expect to lose a few bristles during the first week but it won&#x27;t be anything dramatic.  The pictures of this brush don&#x27;t really do it justice.  After regular use the bristles seem fuller and it takes on a much wider look than what you will see here.  The bristles also become much softer over time so stick with it.  When it comes to lathering, as long as you soak it for a few minutes beforehand you will have an easy time with it.  I have used it with soaps and creams and it does an equally good job.  I&#x27;ve since upgraded to an Edwin Jagger brush to try out a higher quality hair grade but this brush will still be used when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> I have a boar bristle brush and decided to try a badger brush so I could see if there really was a difference. There is, the bagder is a much softer, finer feel to it. I was curious about the ability to generate lather it was so much finer in feel but it actually made the lather quicker and thicker than my boar bristle brush. The feel on my face was much more pleasant as well. While being softer seemed to stimulate my face better and I had not reddness after the sahve as I do with the boar bristle.</li>
    <li> I used this brush for about 6 months. Over that time, it continually lost bristles and then today, all of the bristles broke away from the wood handle.</li>
    <li> I must agree with the reviews comparing this brush favorably to boars hair brushes.  I previously had a boars hair brush I&#x27;d picked up at the drug store for $5.  It was helpful but broke within three weeks.  I ordered the tweezerman brush from Amazon, and the shaving experience has been perfected!  I have searched long and hard for the perfect shave, and this brush has helped me find it.</li>
    <li> Worst shave brush I have ever owned. It looses bristles like crazy and smells funny. I know new brushes loose bristles but this one fills my sink still after 6 month of owning.</li>
    <li> EDIT: Okay, after a few more weeks of daily use, the shedding has almost entirely stopped. It lost one bristle this morning, but I had several &amp;#34;shed free&amp;#34; days in a row. The brush truly does work very well, a world of difference from the boar brush I previously used. At this price point, I must admit that it&#x27;s an excellent value. I&#x27;d bump this review up a star, if I could. ------ This brush is reasonably soft, holds water well, and generates great lather. However, each time I use it, 8-10 bristles get deposited on my face! They clog the razor, and I&#x27;m constantly picking them off my face and sink. I&#x27;d hoped it would be fine after all the loose hairs fell out, but I&#x27;ve been using it daily for two weeks now, and the shedding gets a little worse each day.  If something seems unusually inexpensive, it&#x27;s usually for a reason. I&#x27;m shopping for a new brush, and I won&#x27;t go cheap this time.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t rocket science, which is what the Art of Shaving would like you to believe. I bought this a year ago and it works just fine. Even my old Art of Shaving Brush lost hairs occasionally, and this isn&#x27;t any difference. Certainly doesn&#x27;t effect the shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this inexpensive brush for years, and I use it daily.  Not as luxurious as others, but it gets the job done very well.  No notable loss of brush volume.</li>
    <li> Used it for 5+ years and absolutely loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Very long lasting, very few hair fall out and hard bristles as compare to Escali brand.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it from store. I guess I would prefer this over the Escali brand.</li>
    <li> It does the job -- about a year later I&#x27;ve come to terms with the fact a couple bristles come out with pretty much every usage, and I imagine it used to be much fuller. I don&#x27;t know enough about badger hair brushes to know if this is to be expected or poor craftsmanship, but it&#x27;s definitely inconvenient and has at times clogged my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, again, does the job -- lathers up nicely, distributes smoothly, and is aesthetically pleasing, if not a bit plain.</li>
    <li> Need a new brush? Just starting out? Have no clue what any of this is? BUY THIS BRUSH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now, and it&#x27;s held up very well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This brush is working great for me. Yes some of the bristles fall out; it&#x27;s not a $100 brush so don&#x27;t expect it to be. If you want a brush that is never going to lose one bristle then buy one that costs alot more money. I get one or two bristles falling out some days and some days none. I think it will probably stop soon. I have had no issues with them detaching from the handle but if I do, I will post it. I promise. Well worth the money if you want to try using a shaving brush.</li>
    <li> My wife got me this badger brush as a gift for Father&#x27;s Day, and I just pulled it out of the package a few minutes ago.  I used it to lather up, and as soon as it was under my nose I started smelling something.  Like another reviewer said, it was exactly like a dead animal in the hot summer sun.  Considering the fact that many reviewers love this thing, I think I must have gotten a terrible one that is out of the ordinary, and I truly wonder if there is a bit of badger flesh packed into the handle of this thing - it smelled that bad right out of the package.  I&#x27;m going to try to return it to the seller - amazon.com - and if they take care of the problem I&#x27;ll edit my review.</li>
    <li> This brush is only $10, so you get what you paid for. It smells really bad when you first get it. It will go away after a while. The bristles fall out easily. It doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all. I would highly recommend against this brush and just stick to getting a silver tip badger brush. Don&#x27;t waste your time with the low quality unless you have fine hair, then it may be ok. But with someone like me having a think beard, i need a good lather. This just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> I have had this for two years and it is still like new.  The key to these like any brush, is to rinse and spin dry them with your hands and put store them on a stand. This keeps the glue from failing and the bristles from falling out (not too mention the handle rotting). It&#x27;s made  of  wood and hair folks. Take care of this and it will last and do the same job as the crazy expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> It is not the most finely turned wood handle, but it is a very good shaving brush.  No regrets purchase.</li>
    <li> i used to always use a razor for my neck as my religion doesn&#x27;t allow razors  on the face, and an electric shaver for my face. i always struggled to find the perfect combo until now, and this was the missing peaice, very happy with it, well worth the cost. its expensive, but almost everything in life that is good and far superior to the competition is more expensive, right?</li>
    <li> The Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush is a good, lower-cost product.  Most shaving brushes available nowadays have a healthy price-tag.  In use, the brush produces a nice, even, lather.  A good accessory would be a hanger to hang the brush upside down, as recommended by the manufacturer.  I&#x27;ve only used the brush a short time, but a few of the badger hairs have already come loose.  Nevertheless, it is a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> This brush works well with my Edwin Jagger double edge razor. The bristles work well and it lathers nicely. My only concern is that I notice some bristles fall out (one or two every few shaves - no big deal at all) and the laminate is peeling. I don&#x27;t mind either, as they&#x27;re both extremely minor issues and don&#x27;t affect the performance, considering heavy use.</li>
    <li> It is a decent brush. I have been using it for about a month now and I still lose 6-10 bristles on every shave. If I had to do it over, I would try a different brush. Just so you know I am not abusing it. The brush has never been stored in an upright position. When not in use, it is hanging from a stand.</li>
    <li> Been using this brush for a few months and it&#x27;s pretty decent.  A few hairs do get loose after the first few uses but that&#x27;s part of the breaking in process and only time will tell if this brush holds together.  The brush generates lather very well and the hairs aren&#x27;t too prickly.  The glossy wood handle has a narrowed neck that can be placed on a stand.  It fits perfectly on a Colonel Ichabod Conk Chrome Safety Razor Stand.  You don&#x27;t really need a stand though, it&#x27;s just to help keep the bristles in shape when it&#x27;s drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I don&#x27;t see the need of getting a more expensive brand when the Tweezerman works just fine.  What more can you expect from a plain brush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a brush.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d buy a cheap brush to start out my wet shaving experience.. hell nearly a year ago I think. I bought a shaving kit later and this brush out performs the one in that kit. I don&#x27;t really know what else to say but I high recommend this thing.</li>
    <li> I purchasded the Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush and returned it after a few uses.  The wood cracked down the side and the whole brush was splitting in half.  I returned the brush to Amazon and received a new one, but the same thing started to happen again, so I sent it back and purchased the [[ASIN:B002UB3BF8 Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Chrome Handle) and Free Shaving Brush Stand]].  The Parker brush has been great, but I would not recommend the Tweezerman brush.</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a double edged razor a few weeks ago and have looked into getting some good cream and an inexpensive brush to see if I&#x27;ll enjoy producing my own lather instead of canned creams.  The brush is not perfect, especially after the first shave. I echo an earlier reviewer saying that the brush should be rinsed very well before the first use and break it in a couple of times before you actually use it on your face.  You will lose hairs with those first couple of uses.  Since those first few uses, the brush has performed well.  It will lose a hair or two each time, but what can you expect for this price?  I&#x27;m now a commited DE shaver and love this type of shaving.  I&#x27;ll upgrade but I&#x27;m happy with this starter brush.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time yesterday, with Proraso Shaving Soap.  It left about 20-30 bristles in the soap which i had to pick out by hand.  This has gone straight in the bin.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and does not shed as much as many other brushes</li>
    <li> Moving from a boar brush to this, the first thing I noticed was the difference in quality of lather. Also, feels better, but not as soft as I thought, on my face. Main thing that is a con, but is expected with all badger brushes(guess what I am about to say..) is the putrid odor. i ran shampoo through it a few times, which it did lessen the power of the putrid aroma. overall, its definetly a nice starter brush and a great value.</li>
    <li> I used the previous Amazon review and it did me right.  The brush is wonderful and later I read that boar hair is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush, for a great price too.  I purchased this as a gift for him not knowing anything about shaving brushes and apparently picked a great one.  It has lasted him well over a year and I actually just purchased this same one again because he liked it so much. A good buy at a good price.</li>
    <li> Had this for over 2 years now.  No problem, no bristle falling out, solid product that does not irritate my head and helps with distributing shaving cream evenly.</li>
    <li> I searched around the internet for shaving brushes, and I thought a good one was going to cost me upwards of $50-$75.  I was quite mistaken!  It&#x27;s not the most attractive brush I&#x27;ve seen for sale (no fancy chrome or extraneously colored hair), but it does its job as well as I could imagine an expensive one accomplishing.  Sure, it loses maybe a hair every few shaves, but they haven&#x27;t interfered with my shaving at all (I&#x27;ve only seen them in the soap mug, never on my face), and I doubt any brush is hair-loss proof, no matter how much money you spend.    I even let a friend try it out, and now I&#x27;m ordering one for him!    Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I give this one 4 stars just because I have never used any other badger brushes so I can&#x27;t compare it to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this one is nice and soft feeling and worked up a mean lather from my Col. Conk&#x27;s shaving soap in no time. The key is to use plenty of water, and mix until the lather is smooth and glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wooden handle might deteriorate after a while, but this is definitely a good starter brush for anyone who wants to try wet shaving without breaking the bank on a $100+ silver tipped badger brush :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it with a Merkur Classic DE razor and the two worked really well together to give me a great shave. I look forward to tomorrow when I get to do it again!</li>
    <li> This brush is a great value.  It is a little stiff at first,but will soften up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this with soaps and creams no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better brushes out there and i still use this for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, this is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush about three weeks ago.  With all the comments I read about these brushes losing hair, I wanted to give it a bit before I reviewed...  In short, I have not lost a single hair yet--and I check it every time I use it.  The first two or three times I used it, the badger &#x27;aroma&#x27; was apparent.  Even so, it was not obnoxious, just an animal-ish smell.  This was not obnoxious and it did not last long.  The brush works very well in whipping up a lather and I am careful to store it upside down to drain and squeeze it gently to wring it out.  The price was very low for a badger brush and it has been worth every penny even if it were to explode next week!  I don&#x27;t think it will.  It works well, I enjoy using it, it seems durable,it didn&#x27;t break the bank.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> I had this brush for about a year before the entire knot of hair fell out, despite proper care and storage (bristles down, gently shaken dry, all that). Great first brush, but for your second brush, spend a little more and get something good.</li>
    <li> good brush strong bristles but was left in the shower and now the lacquer turned milky white, cracked and is chipping off.  Don&#x27;t let it get wet... especially after midnight</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for 18 months. 6 months as a primary brush, 12 months as a travel brush. I love it. Minimal shedding as long as you properly maintain it. If it ever needs to be replaced, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush to replace my old worn out brush and am very satisfied with it. I get a nice lather from it and all I use is leftover discarded small pieces of soap from the bar and add it to my shaving mug. This brush serves up a healthy dose of lather.</li>
    <li> Solidly average is where this little guy sits - and that&#x27;s not a bad thing at all. For a beginner or someone that dabbles in wet shaving, it&#x27;s a great fit and definitely better than using one of the super cheap brushes you can occasionally find in places like CVS or Walgreens. The bristles are little uneven, and every time I used the brush a couple would come out. That being said, it still whipped up a smooth, rich lather for your shaving enjoyment.</li>
    <li> It seemed like a quality brush when I first bought it.  It lathered up well but the bristles were a little course.  After about two months of daily use the section that held the bristles fell out.  I tried to glue it back in but it wasn&#x27;t the same and didn&#x27;t look very nice.</li>
    <li> Using this bristle once a week , each time a little too  many bristles falls out, and then just after 3 months  the bristle bundle broke loose from the handle.  Where was the quality controller for this product?!  Its just bad! considering one paid 15 dollars plus shipping  Never again Tweezerman</li>
    <li> This brush is just as good as any of the high end brushes on the market.  It holds together well and is very affordable.</li>
    <li> Like the title says. The brush had a heavy badger scent (smells like badger ass)but it can be removed by washing it with shampoo and conditioner a few times. Makes great lather quickly but does not retain heat as well as some of my top dollar brushes. Other than that its a great starter brush and couldent be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this over a year now and think it&#x27;s nice. There is no doubt I get a better shave if I use it rather than don&#x27;t. The bristles are pretty nice and they work up a good lather. They also scratch up your whiskers to loosen them for the shave. The brush still looks pretty good after a year of daily use. I keep it in the shower and it dries up in a few hours. And it&#x27;s a no-brainer to say but, just keep the bristles down so the water drops out, don&#x27;t stand it up if it&#x27;s moist.</li>
    <li> I have several brushes in my collection including silver tip badger down to a $5.00 boar bristle.  As I like to alternate days, I thought thia Tweezerman would be a good middle of the road brush.  As it turns out, I find it to be the least comfortable brush I have ever owned.  The brissles/hair in the center of the brush actually feel prickly when attempting to lather my face.  It appears to be well constructed but sheds heavily.  I was very disappointed with this brush overall and could not, in good conscience, recommend it at any price point.  Rather than retruning the brush, I will throw it in with my guncleaning gear.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever owned</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really compare it to anything else, but this thing is capable of making a nice lather. It&#x27;s cheap and the quality is nice. It lost a few bristles the first week or so, but it&#x27;s been going strong for over a year now!</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed.  I thought it would be a fuller brush, but my husband loves iit.</li>
    <li> The finer, softer bristles of badger hair do make a difference.  The brush makes great lather, feels good on the face.  I doubt a $50+ British brush is any better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no trouble at all with this brush in the month or so since purchase.  Does exactly what I want it to do; no complaints.    I have no idea what a brush costing X multiples would offer that this brush doesn&#x27;t, other than vanity frills like an ivory handle or some such.    Update (11/29/10): The sleeve that holds the bristles popped out a year ago due to glue deterioration - I was able to glue it back in and use the brush without further incident.    Now the handle is cracking where the sleeve is inserted - the brush will be unusable in short order.  I took decent care of the product, drying the brush bristles down; the problem most likely is that I shave in the shower and the constant humidity did its thing on the wooden handle.  Maybe that ivory handle I poo-pooed isn&#x27;t such a bad idea...</li>
    <li> I use these types of brushes to clean my clipper and beard trimmer. They work much better than anything else I could find. I shave my head with a clipper and use this brush to clean it along with the hair around my ears and neck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had an older plastic brush for like 10 years and it started to shed big time, so I needed a new one. As others have stated, a quality brush of this type is not cheap. I didn&#x27;t do exhaustive research, but this does seem to be a really good deal. Anyway, I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it works well. The bristles are very soft when I use it to brush off hair around my ears and neck.</li>
    <li> Seems like a good deal for a beginner shaving brush...it&#x27;s the number 1 or 2 seller. But newbies to wet shaving would be served much better with an Omega or Semogue boar brush. This product constantly sheds bristles, feels very scratchy against my face, and makes it difficult to lather soap/creams.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have to say I&#x27;m liking it.  It has lost a few bristles, but nothing to be concerned over.  It&#x27;s really a great brush.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it, although he&#x27;s not going to switch to shaving with a straight razor.</li>
    <li> This only the second shaving brush I&#x27;ve used, the first being a really cheap boar hair brush.  The Tweezerman is much better.  It cleans and dries much more quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t lose as many bristles per shave as the cheaper one.  I&#x27;m giving it a four because it&#x27;s a the first badger hair brush I&#x27;ve used, and perhaps the more expensive ones do a better job.    If you&#x27;re just getting started with wet-shaving, I&#x27;d go with the Tweezerman.  You don&#x27;t want to invest in a really expensive brush, then end up not liking it.  This one does its job and is not overpriced.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as nice as the Omega brush I usually use. I got it for travel. That said, it&#x27;s really quite good. Whips up a good lather, nice feel to the badger bristles. Best price for a badger brush that I found.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving with a safety razor about a year ago and used a cheap boar bristle brush.  This is much different in that it shakes water off very quickly so I&#x27;ve had to get used to keeping it wetter than my instincts want.  Works great with my shave soap, and after the first few weeks it&#x27;s not shedding hairs or anything.  I&#x27;m following the advice of other reviewers to always let it dry with the bristles down so it doesn&#x27;t soak through and damage the wood handle.</li>
    <li> I know that many folks will tell you that you can buy better shaving brushes that won&#x27;t lose their bristles, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that you can. However, I&#x27;ve been lathering my shaving soap by hand and then applying it to my wetted face for a few months now and I think that is far superior to lathering with a brush. Then again, I&#x27;m a mid-20s guy and not a more aged fellow who has been doing this for awhile, so maybe I just don&#x27;t see the benefits of brush lathering.</li>
    <li> I have to say after trying a few different things, first your standard razor, then, a gillette power fusion, then an electric razor, that I think I&#x27;ve found a new winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I thought I&#x27;d try an electric razor because I wanted to see if one actually worked.  The electric razor I have, is the [[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Blue]].  I found that using that on conjunction with Afta Pre-electric shave, I end up with what looks like a day old shave, when comparing it to shaving with a DE razor (using a 100 pack Feather blades).  Without Pre-electric shave, forget it. It just didn&#x27;t work all that well, but at the time, I was just too lazy to go back to my original razor to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this product, is that it completely wakes me up in the morning. It feels great to shave like this.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s back to the old problems I had with an original razor: I cut myself.  So much for a \\&quot;safety\\&quot; razor.  I don&#x27;t know how safe it is, but hey, whatever.  It works, it&#x27;s comfortable, and applying the soap can get pretty sloppy.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush for the price.  Makes an excellent thick lather and is durable and easy to maintain.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I know that you get what you pay for, and I expected the quality, and read reviews about proper maintenance before purchasing, but I still feel like I wasn&#x27;t prepared for how small this brush really is. Overall I am satisfied and will continue to use it, knowing that I will eventually adjust to the smaller size.</li>
    <li> This was my first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; brush and I still go back to it as my primary for straight razor shaving.</li>
    <li> make a stand /or get one to hold the brush, upside down { from the photo} because the handle is wood, and the water in the brush hair will rot the glue and the handle if you don&#x27;t !  not a big thing if you take care of the brush, but don&#x27;t use and then put it down, like the photo</li>
    <li> Like I say in the subject line it is a great product for the price.. I would actually have been willing to pay a little more for this kind of quality. I have been using it for a couple of years now and it is just now needing to be replaced.</li>
    <li> This is my first and only experience with a shaving brush.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it&#x27;s still going strong.  It makes a nice lather and I&#x27;ve only seen a few bristles lost into the lather, maybe one every fifth shave.  I would definitely buy it again no question.</li>
    <li> This has got to be hands down the best shave brush I have ever owned. The handle is the right size and the brush is not shedding.  I like that the bristles are just stiff enough to make the a quick lather and make your beard really stand up for a close shave.</li>
    <li> Note : since I bought  two more ..I just put these two on reserve....I did not use them yet &amp;#62;&amp;#62;so I cannot judge at this time but I think at least they are OK</li>
    <li> A good entry level shaving brush that will not cost you a arm and a leg....You do loose a few bristles the first week or so...Just make sure you pre-soak  it, I used regular shampoo and that seem to work fine.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any brushes &amp;#62;$20 yet, so I can only compare to brushes in the same price range, which I think is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft bristles, yet firm enough to stay straight when applying lather.&lt;br /&gt;Dries straight without matting or deforming.&lt;br /&gt;Very few lost bristles after 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: you can&#x27;t possibly be disappointed at this price point.</li>
    <li> Better than the starter brush I had before it, but not THAT much better - I was expecting more. This one seemed to need to be &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34; as there were a few stiff bristles that softened over time with use.</li>
    <li> Made very well, holds up great with no loss of bristles and no problems with a cracking base. Just remember to shake out excess water after shaving and store it bristles down (on a stand, which you should definitely get). I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d feel bad giving a $10 brush a 1 star rating, so I&#x27;ll give it 2 because of the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen guys, this thing is not a quality brush. It sheds like a Siberian Husky in a Texas summer. I constantly have to fish out hairs from my soap dish with a tweezers. Incidentally, the \\&quot;Tweezerman\\&quot; company specializes in making and selling tweezers. Coincidence? Or mastermind conspiracy to boost tweezers sales? Probably coincidence, but still a real nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, I have a stand for it so I can store it upside-down, I shave with distilled water, I am very gentle with it, and it still keeps shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... IF you&#x27;re just starting out wet-shaving and aren&#x27;t sure if you&#x27;re in for the long haul, AND you&#x27;re totally comfortable picking hairs out of your soap dish until you&#x27;re left with an empty brush handle, AND you only have $20 in your bank account - half of which needs to cover meals for the next week, then I&#x27;d STILL suggest you stick to ramen noodles for a while so you can buy a better brush than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
    <li> I have one of these and am buying one for my son.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year and I think it stopped shedding after about 9 months.  Had I paid a lot for this that would bother me but for what I paid, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a shaving brush.  I&#x27;ve yet to try a more expensive brush so I can&#x27;t speak to that.  But I love the feel of this brush.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t want softer bristles.  (I may sing a different tune after trying it though)  But for a starter brush you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> This brush makes an outstanding lather.  I use it daily and lather either on my face or in a mug.  I am surprised at the quality of the lather i produce from this brush as it was priced so low.  A couple hairs have fallen out but it is still full and works great!</li>
    <li> Being a newcomer to shaving with a DE safety razor, I was looking for a entry level shaving brush. Having seen that top of the line badger hair brushes can cost up to $200 (and beyond), I was surprised to come across this brush selling at less than $15. Not having the experience of using a high end brush to compare against, I can only say that I am very happy with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially the brush shedded about 2-3 hairs each time I used it but it stopped in about 2-3 days. The bristles are quite soft and do not give the prickly feeling, even on the first day of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this may be a budget priced brush, I think brush care is very important. I came across 2 articles that I think (in my limited experience) would be applicable to all shaving brush users:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breaking in a new brush - [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drying and brush maintenance - [...]</li>
    <li> Since we have a second home, I have a shaving brush at each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first brush was purchased at Walgreen&#x27;s and works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This more expensive brush is superior in feel, balance, shaving soap application, etc.  I can tell the difference between the two brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some initial shedding on this brush (none on the Walgreen&#x27;s); but, after a few shaves, there is no issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about four months into this brush and it started shedding like crazy. I&#x27;m talking about five hairs per shave. I took excellent care with it, which included soaking below the knot and rinsing regularly, followed by storage upside-down in a stand. Would recommend as a temporary starter brush, but I would recommend starting with an Omega or Semogue instead.</li>
    <li> This brush was very sharp and lost alot of hair the first time I used it but that was because it was no used yet. Now the brush is really soft and barely loses a hair now. It lathers really well and I am glad I got this for my first brush. I do recommend this brush for a first time brush or a budget brush.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for the price. The hairs do come off sometimes but not often enough for me to complain. Overall this is soft and simply works.</li>
    <li> Good shaving brush, looks nice, functions well.  Find it does lose a few strands of hair when mixing shaving cream in a bowl.  Hopefully, this will subside, or perhaps maybe this is the name of the game with beaver hair brushes.  Overall, a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Even with a shaving brush stand and gentle use (both in the cup and on my face), this brush has lost bristles every time I&#x27;ve used it. I will be returning it. I get a better shave using the regular shaving cream, hand-applied, that I was using.</li>
    <li> Just got this brush yesterday. I haven&#x27;t used it yet and also this is my first brush. Knowing that I am new to this, that is how I am basing this review. I am very impressed! The brush is very high quality, looks great. The bristles are soft and even and have a nice color to them. I was impressed with the nice finish on the wood handle and the quality of the bristles. There was no stink to the brush like I have read about badger brushes. So since I have not used it yet I am giving it five stars based on how I am impressed with the build quality and looks and PRICE. I don&#x27;t think I will have any issues when I do use it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;I have now used the brush. I first washed it two times with shampoo just to make sure it was clean. As far as shedding, around 4 hairs fell out while shampooing. After that was done I soaked the bristles in hot water while prepping my face. Used the brush to lather and do a three pass shave. Worked GREAT. I like it even more now that I have used it. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend looking to get &amp;#34;fancy shaving stuff.&amp;#34;  He loves it!  It&#x27;s so soft.  The brush has held up well while under near-daily use.  A great purchase to go along with shaving soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is the difference between this and some of the brushes some folks pay a hundred bucks for. I never really enjoyed shaving until I got into the double edge shaving and away from the disposable razors. So I&#x27;ve been on the double edge kick for about a year now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The savings on the shavings is wonderful! Now on to this product review with my background laid out. I did have a cheaper, harder hair brush that I was not happy with so as it just felt cheap as far as the handle and it lost more hair than me. So I thought I&#x27;d give this a try due to two things, it&#x27;s reviews and it&#x27;s price. This is the perfect brush. Pair it with a good shaving soap and you are good to go. No need to buy anything more expensive, that&#x27;s a total waste of money. Maybe it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;goob&amp;#34; thing for some guys to brag about a certain &amp;#34;haired&amp;#34; brush being better than others, but for me, if it does the job it&#x27;s fine. That&#x27;s what this brush is. A good quality brush at a good price. I don&#x27;t always shave as much as I should, but when I do, I use the Tweezerman Shaving Brush. Shave on my friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years and it is still as good as new. Get this if you are getting into wet shaving or need a new brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Bought this one for my husband when his old brush wore out after several years. This one is very soft, and has held up great after a year of use. He uses it to foam up regular soap in the shower to use as shaving soap. It works fabulously.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for!  I have to relearn that lesson once in a while.  The brush worked just fine but, after a while, I started to experience the same problems that others described.  The brush started loosing bristles - once in a while at first.  Then, five or sic bristles started to come out each time I used it and it became an annoyance.  Saving money is good but, if you wind up having to replace it in less than six months, you&#x27;re not saving anything.</li>
    <li> Surprised how light it was. Maybe it is a travel brush? Not as hefty or full as the Van Der Hagen brush. But very good. I&#x27;m not sure why you need any better of a brush. Really, men don&#x27;t care about &amp;#34;exfoliation&amp;#34;, and a regularly cut beard does not need the &amp;#34;hairs lifted up&amp;#34;. It works fine for applying the right amount of water to your face followed by shave soap. The idea of whipping up a meringue-like foam sounds great, but I&#x27;m not sure super lathered soap works any better than a nice film coating. But if that is what you like, I don&#x27;t see any problem here.</li>
    <li> This brush is a good quality for the money and outperforms previous purchased brush that was much more expensive. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This review may get lost among houndreds but here goes. The Tweezermans brush is good if your just getting to this style of shaving. After using for over a year, I would reccomend buying either a better quality brush, or going with boar hair because this brush gets too soft when applying soap to your face.</li>
    <li> Shaving with a brush and safety razor can give you a wonderful close shave.  Just be careful with razor blades and get  the Colonel Conk Razor stand as well.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive brush. The badger is soft and holds water very well. Not all that crazy about the logo on the handle, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the brush. It lost a little hair to begin with, but has lasted almost 2 years and is still in great shape. It fits a little tight in the Colonel Conk stand, but not a problem.</li>
    <li> So I bought this brush a few months ago to carry with me when I travel. I travel about 3-4 days a week for work. The price was good and so were the reviews. Today I tossed it in the trash because it sheds hair like crazy every time I use it. At first it was a little at a time but now I have to spend time picking all the hairs off my face before I can shave. Not cool. They just fall out with very gentle use. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defectives be or what but I will not ever buy this again.</li>
    <li> I wish I could recommend this item, but I can&#x27;t. For ~$13 it&#x27;s definitely an &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34; alternative if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving. If you really cannot go higher than that, then this is an OK alternative. The brush will last and it is not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I definitely do not recommend this one! This was the first brush I bought and I bought it precisely because it was so cheap. I was...disappointed to say the least. It is NOT soft. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not horribly hard, but it&#x27;s definitely not soft either. It is also not very big, just OK sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you can afford something in the ~$25 range, go for one of the cheaper Parker Safety Razor brushes. Their entry level brushes cost about that much. That was the second brush I bought and it&#x27;s well worth the ~$10 difference! It&#x27;s really soft, makes better lather, and it&#x27;s bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I don&#x27;t hate this brush (and I still use it on occasion), but I definitely recommend Parker&#x27;s before this one if you can spend a bit more.</li>
    <li> This brush sheds bristles every time I use it. Gets the job done though and is good for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap and functional brush. It doesn&#x27;t feel like silvertip or other high quality badger bristle to me. The bristle is stiff and hasn&#x27;t softened after three years of hot shaving. It lathers OK but drips water too much for my liking. The lather is also not as fine as a softer bristled brush in my opinion. All that said it&#x27;s functional and I shaved with it successfully for three years, so if your budget is tight and you still desire a shaving brush it will work for you and will be satisfactory. I give it three stars as a result!</li>
    <li> As a first timer, I wanted something on the cheap side in case I hated the DE shaving.  I love the shaving, and the brush does exactly what I need it to.  A little rough, but felt nice overall.</li>
    <li> Badger hair shaving brushes are not the cheapest items in the world.  Not to mention usually you get what you pay for; however I have to say that this brush bucks that trend.    The brush does the job at a price MUCH better than the competitors.    My one minor issue:  -the first brush I bought repeatedly would lose hairs each time I used it.  I hoped it would stop at some point but this went on for a month or so.  In a strange sort of luck, I managed to leave the brush behind on a business trip and had to purchase a new one.  The new brush works like a charm.    In a nutshell, I would not hesitate, if you need a shaving brush and do NOT want to pay an arm and a leg then this is the brush for you.    On a side note, if you are considering this brush you should also consider (if you have not already) switching to a Safety Razor rather than the economy razors you find in the supermarket.  My shaving experience and outcome has changed considerably as a result of using this brush as well as the safety razor.  My recommendation for a safety razor: Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178    As far as shaving soap and blades goes: check out eBay as well as Amazon</li>
    <li> For the money, you cant buy a better shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is on the small size, and the handle is small.  I wish it was a bit larger.  But its a very good brush and has done all I have asked.  No problem with shedding and  reasonably soft.  I like a stiffer brusn to scrub with and like using this brush.  I am glad I bought it and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve joined the ranks of guys with badger bristles falling out. They get all over the soap and all over my face. They clog up the razor. I would not purchase this a second time.</li>
    <li> great quality, bought one for my father as well. The hair won&#x27;t fall off like most cheap ones would do.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect when I got this as stocking stuffer.  I had mentioned that I wanted to try a more \\&quot;grown up\\&quot; approach to shaving.  Armed with the Art of Shave shaving cream i tried out my Tweezerman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First it seemed to feel a little more cheap than some of the more expensive brushes I looked at.  Second there were a few loose badger hairs when I opened up the packaging.  However after several uses I have not seen any other hairs out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked like a charm just a little bit of shave cream and the next thing you know my face has the look of a frothing maniac.  It also gets the whiskers to stand up which makes shaving easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman worked fine for me and for now I dont know why anyone would want to buy a brush at double the price.</li>
    <li> Update: After using this brush for nearly 8 years I have concluded that, while functional, this brush can be outperformed by many others at a similar price point. Check out the Omega boar and synthetic brushes which are larger and higher quality, and will create a better lather and hold more of it. These are available on Amazon for around the same price, and they&#x27;re made in Italy! Generally it&#x27;s best to avoid cheap badger brushes and this is definitely one of them. After upgrading to a $30 Stirling Soap Company badger brush I see that there is hardly a comparison between cheap and good badger.  for my first foray into traditional DE wetshaving, i purchased this brush, along with a Merkur Classic #178 and some Col. Conk soap as recommended by a list of shaving products here on amazon. I dont have any experience with another brush against which to compare, but this brush has worked very well for me in the week or so i have been using it. it looks smaller to other brushes i have seen in video reviews, but none the less it creates a nice smooth lather once you get the motion down. Stopped losing hairs after a few weeks of regular use.  This brush is a great value since it costs far less than any others on Amazon and does what it promises. that being said, i will buy a nicer one in the future, which is what im sure most of the people who buy this do.</li>
    <li> Had a boar hair shaving brush. Read the reviews about a Badger hair brush.  The price was good. Reviews were good.  Ordered it and am very satisfied.  It is superior to the boar hair shaving brush I had been using.</li>
    <li> After 2 shaves the bristles fell out of the brush.    Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a little over a month, and am very satisfied.  I primarily shave with shaving soap and have no problems getting a thick, rich lather with this brush.  It does shed a hair or two each shave, but for the price, there is no sense in complaining.  Hopefully this will last a few years, as I can&#x27;t see trying anything more expensive at this point.</li>
    <li> Just as mentioned, the brush was not attached to the wooden handle, because of improper gluing but cuz I always have a bottle of gorilla glu at home thats all it took to make a perfect brush...and yes when wet it smells like a wet badger..go figure...but with some great sandalwood shave soap the badger smell was no more.....well worth it...know the purpose of the brush and research how to properly use it b4 u decide to THINK u hate it..poor knowledge will lead to poor reviews.....</li>
    <li> The brush gives out a terrible smell for about a week. I have no idea why manufacturer could not wash hairs of the brush before they manufacture the brush.</li>
    <li> This brush feels great and is so much softer than my boar brush.  I was so happy when I received it.  Made great lather it BUT then I used it and it shed like crazy!!!!!  It makes great lather, feels great on my face but it just sheds way too much. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now and it just keeps shedding.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and so far it has held up. The wood on it is a little darker than it looks in the picture, but still looks very nice and expensive. Also some of the bristles have started to fall out, but he&#x27;s pretty rough with it so I&#x27;m not surprised.</li>
    <li> This is a great shave brush. I left mine at the hotel during vacation and I promptly purchased this same brush upon my return.</li>
    <li> It fell apart in the first few uses, not put together very well, but if it&#x27;s for travel, it will do.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my hubby and he loves it.  Makes his face feel smooth after he saves.  Definitely a must have</li>
    <li> Great little brush for the price!!!! The badger hairs get softer every time you use it....I only say that for the new shavers out there.....the only issue I have is the wood handle....I wish it was a little heavier....</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Less strokes to get great foam than usual shaving brushes.  Years of use and going strong.  Would recommend to anyone who uses a blade to shave.</li>
    <li> This feels like a boar bristle brush. It does its job. I needed another brush before a trip and this is the one I picked up to take as my traveling brush. It sheds some but as I said it does its job.</li>
    <li> hubby loves it.  he uses it along with old fashion straight razor once again</li>
    <li> After researching items for assembling the perfect shave basket for a father&#x27;s day gift, I decided on this brush as part of that gift. I was not disappointed. My husband has been using for months now and the brush has according to him stayed in working order. It has not lost hairs and to me looks no worse for wear. I may not be a straight razor user, but I will say for you ladies who like a smooth cheek to kiss on your hubby, this is a great way to go for a good price.</li>
    <li> A fine starter brush.  It lasted about a year, and was light, compact and easy to use.  After a while, hair started falling out at an increasing rate, so I figured it was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replaced with an Omega, which is more sturdy but not as easy to use out of the box, also less portable.</li>
    <li> i use it every time i shave. doesn&#x27;t poke the skin too much and makes a good lather. cleans the face well to prevent pimples</li>
    <li> In my ~ 20 years of shaving I found that using a shaving brush and shaving cream is much more likely to produce a clean shave free of irritations. It could be that this setup works because it increases the time the shaving cream has to soften the beard compared to regular bottled shaving foam.&lt;br /&gt;So before you change to a more expensive even more blades razor, why don&#x27;t you try a shaving brush and shaving cream first? It&#x27;s also the only way to shave for a Renaissance man!</li>
    <li> I use this brush for different facial skin treatments, masks.. etc. Works great and I would recommend this for women that take care of their skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for the price.  A great starter brush.  Makes wonderful lather.  I would be comfortable recommending this brush.  Works just as well as my higher end brushes.</li>
    <li> Works well. A bit stiff compared to a silver tip of course, but for the price, it does the job nicely. Mine has held up for years and is like new.</li>
    <li> It is was my first shot at using a badger brush and it didnt disappoint.Good buy for the price and good for beginners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of softer bristles. I prefer a stiffer bristle as I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m doing much with the lather with soft bristles.  This brush did form a decent lather and for the price, it&#x27;s worth trying to see if you like a softer bristle.</li>
    <li> Applies shaving cream excellent and cleans up easily. A quality brush that does the job well. So far the base has held up and is not coming apart - I store it in a stand with my matching Merkur Model 180 Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> Constantly falling apart and it doesn&#x27;t feel as a soft as my cousin&#x27;s badger haired brush. If you dong mind clumps of not your hair on your face then this works.</li>
    <li> I would prefer a bit more whiskers.  But it is holding up for a year now and only shed a few hairs in first couple of months.  If the hairs would be longer, that brush would benefit some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this thing every two days for years now. It looks brand new. In fact, I&#x27;d like it to get worn out so I can buy something new! It works and lasts forever!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel very sturdy and leaves all the hair in your face and in the soap/mug. A terrible choice for a brush</li>
    <li> Bout as a gift, and for my self in the past great value for the money, I have bought cheaper ones and more expensive brushes and this one is perfect for me I think it is a great value.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and likes it very  much.</li>
    <li> For my son, uses above shaving lotion and brush allows shave cream to last quite a bit longer than your standard spray can.  Also supplies a thick moistening contrast for his razor.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best deals on Amazon. Purchased several of these brushes and I am still on my first one. Use it properly and you will get years of use out of it.</li>
    <li> Very soft and comparable to much more expensive models. Takes a little while to get the Kiss My Face worked up to a lather and have to be very precise about how much water to use. I started using safety razors and will never go back now.</li>
    <li> It smelled a little funny and the first 6 months of losing whiskers was a little annoying but 4 years latter its been a great brush and is still very soft and solid!</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush and I have to say I&#x27;m pleased with it. I like the price, and it seems to be holding up fine after 4 uses. It lost around a dozen or so hairs the first few uses, but haven&#x27;t noticed any falling out since last use, and I&#x27;m taking good care of it. Didn&#x27;t have a funky smell out of the box, and now just smells like sandalwood. Just wondering why I didn&#x27;t start shaving this way earlier.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my last brush I had, but good for the price I paid.  But that is true of almost everything I buy.  It has softened with use making it work better as it gets used.</li>
    <li> I was super pumped by getting this brush when I bought it. I had just purchased a merkur safety razor and a blade sample pack along with some Proraso shave soap. It only lasted for about 18 months before the degradation to the handle made me want to replace it. This is partially my fault as I didn&#x27;t hang it up so the lacquer on the handle wore off. The brush itself was nicely made though the bristles did tend to shed a very small amount even from the first use.</li>
    <li> Ral badger hair, soft yet stiff. works great, fantastic price, what more is there to say? Great brush for the beginner.</li>
    <li> It just works and it didn&#x27;t cost me $150.  I&#x27;ve noticed a hair or two that have left the brush, but I&#x27;ve never had a brush that hasn&#x27;t shed at least a little bit.  The other brush I had (not Tweezerman) shed bristles in chunks.</li>
    <li> Nice brush for the money. After almost two years of service it&#x27;s still going strong and I feel no desire to upgrade. Yes it sheds a hair every now and then and it&#x27;s not a big bushy head of a thing; but it beats boar bristle and gets the job done. Who can ask more?</li>
    <li> The bottom line here is that Tweezerman has terrible quality control. Some people get lucky and receive a brush that is fine. Other like myself receive a brush that seems fine for awhile, then falls apart. Others still receive a brush that is horrible from the beginning. Why would you want to gamble with your money when there are better products out there, some for less money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t do it. It is not worth the risk.</li>
    <li> I received this item sooner than expected. I&#x27;ve used it a few times a week for 2 months now and it&#x27;s great. Does smell and shed initially, but after 2 uses there&#x27;s no smell. Over all, If I need another boar hair brush at a reasonable price, I&#x27;d choose this one!</li>
    <li> This is a must have for anyone getting in to proper shaving. Or as a travel or backup brush. I would say it does shed a lot more than my very expensive brushes but at the price point it can&#x27;t be be beat.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this shaving brush and I have been using it for a long time. It works exactly as advertised and I am another happy Amazon customer!</li>
    <li> Great brush for a beginner.  Makes very rich and thick lather.  Only downside is the wooden handle.  The protective coating on the wood started to peel off from the top at the very beginning.  It&#x27;s also developed a small crack.  Other than that, great brush!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy, this product is terrible. Spend the extra $10 and get a good badger brush. You might not think a brush matters but it definitely does.</li>
    <li> holding well for 3 months now. looks good. and I shave daily and I shave head about weekly. I wanted to buy a little denser one but that costs about $175 in my local art of shaving. this one feels much better on pocket</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement to a brush I lost.  This one&#x27;s handle started to have a plastic coating on the bottom come off shortly after I started using it.  The bristles felt different as well.  This may be due to the natural fibers.  It is still not a consistent product.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it looks great on my brush stand and works well. Its on the smaller side, but still does the job.</li>
    <li> The brush is in really good condition. My husband was really happy when he saw it.  He used it when we got it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out traditional shaving so I chose this brush based on price and customer reviews, After several months it&#x27;s still losing bristles during each use. I&#x27;ve followed all the recommendations for use and care including rinsing, gently twisting to wring out moisture, and storing upside down to dry after each use. I was recently given an Escali which looks nearly identical (I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they are made in the same factory), but the bristles on the Escali are much softer than the Tweezerman. I&#x27;ve only used the Escali a couple of times so I can&#x27;t comment on long term durability, but it&#x27;s losing a lot of bristles already. I suspect this item either varies in quality, or the quality has degraded over since it was introduced.</li>
    <li> This brush is an excellent brush for the price. I have other, more expensive brushes, and this one equal or exceeds them in quality.</li>
    <li> This is a shaving brush? on my face it feels like the stiff broom I use to sweep my garage floor-I have wire brushes for stripping paint that would be easier on my skin-I have used shaving brushes for years and am totally shocked at how bad this product is.</li>
    <li> Bought as a replacement for my husband.  Unfortunately, he found another old brush and hasn&#x27;t started using this one yet.  Go figure!  It looks like it will be just fine.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how soft badger hair is compared to boars hair.  I told my wife to feel it against her face and she thought it felt like a brillow pad but she is used to using her foo foo brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush is much better than other brushes that I have used in the past. It works as described, little shedding and holds its shape well. This is a good brush and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Shaving stuff can be expensive, nice affordable brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps with lather and a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be very durable.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this brush inconsistently (beard guy) for 4 years now.  It still looks quite new.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using a \\&quot;Bore Beissel\\&quot; brush. This brush holds water better for a better lather. Also, seems to rinse better.</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving for most of my 39 years and this is the best brush I have ever owned.  the bristles stay in the handles and do not fall out during use.  make a rich lather with the mug soap, and after a couple months of good use the handle is in like new shape.  to maintain any brush you must hang it up with the bristles facing down    UPDATE: have been using this brush since Sept 09.  it still looks new.  I make sure to hang it up after every use brush down.  i also rinse it after every use.  I think i have to will this to my daughters husband.  By the way she is 10 years old right now.</li>
    <li> This badger hair brush has been perfect.  It holds moisture and shaving cream as it should and rinses easily.  It doesn&#x27;t shed and feels comfortable in the hand.</li>
    <li> What a difference a good shave makes! This badger hair brush lathers well and is kind to the face. I wish I&#x27;d got one of these years ago. And it hasn&#x27;t shed at all. Hang it upside down or rest it on its side to dry and it remains fluffy. Good product and worth the few dollars more.    Thanks, little critter.</li>
    <li> APPERANTLY I HAVEN&#x27;T DONE MY RESEARCH RIGH, I&#x27;VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GOOD BRUSH FOR ABOUT A MONTH OR SO,SINCE THIS IS MY FIRST BRUSH AND I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO GET AN EXPENSIVE ONE AT THIS STAGE. THE PRICE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, LOOSES HAIR RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, AND WHEN SHAVING IT LEAVES HAIR ON YOUR FACE, IT ALSO STUNCK LIKE A RUBBER OR SOMETHING. I DON&#x27;T KNOW, MAYBE THATS HOW IT SHOULD BE FIRST- SECOND USE (BUT I DOUBT IT). SO I&#x27;M PROBABLY GOING TO GO WITH A HIGHET QUALITY BRUSH.</li>
    <li> this completed the set My son got his razor and the soap and the brush to use it is very well made and will last a long time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. It makes a pretty good lather and although I have lost some hairs from it during use I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s excessive. It&#x27;s easy to use and the handle seems to be good quality. Hoping it holds up for a while, we&#x27;ll see I guess. If you&#x27;re thinking about switching to wet shaving over the crappy canned goo, this is a great starter brush.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing little shave brush, and a great value.     Its just stiff enough to build a great lather quickly. Its now my go-to brush.</li>
    <li> This Badger Brush makes lots of lather for the price.  Good heft and soft tip badger hair.</li>
    <li> The Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush is a great quality brush for the money.  The knot is full and the handle is a nicely finished piece of wood.  I would recommend this brush for a great quality starter brush.  Being that Badger brushes have a wide range of quality bristles, this one has a great feel.</li>
    <li> The hairs shed a little in the beginning but all in all great moisture hold!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheap entry-level badger-hair brush. I had previously bought a cheap boar-brush from Walmart and it was quite rough and just pushed lather around my face instead of actually hydrating the lather and building it.    This brush is quite nice for what I paid. Anyone looking to get into wetshaving but who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money should get this and enjoy how much more water it holds over cheap boar-brushes. I use it with C.O. Bigelow Shaving Cream in a mug and the lather is amazing. The brush is not prickly at all and it makes it very comfortable to move around your face and spread lathery goodness.    I knocked one star off because the first few times I used it it lost bristles and it worried me, but now it is not losing anymore and hopefully will stay great.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush when i decided to start shaving with a double edge blade and didnt want to spend a ton of money , excellent beginner brush</li>
    <li> I just received my Tweezerman shaving brush, I&#x27;ve used it a few times and find it a pretty decent product thus far. For the $12.00 I paid, you really cant go wrong. I can say this, it&#x27;s not as good as a C-MON I found at a garage sale a few years ago. Now that thing is amazing, shaving suds to spare. Funny thing is, it&#x27;s not made from Badger hair like the Tweezerman is, not really sure what it&#x27;s made of? I can most definitely say, the Tweezerman beats the offerings at Walmart or any drugstore by leaps and bounds. Well worth the low price you pay on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The varnish wore off of the wood writhing a few months due to water exposure. The brush can be sharp sometimes like using wood splinters. Most of the time it&#x27;s good enough button I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it daily for years.</li>
    <li> Now I know why \\&quot;shaving geeks\\&quot; recommend using a good quality shaving cream along with a good badger-hair brush for shaving. I now get a nice, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/15/13: After 3 ears of use, this accessory is holding up nicely! Has barely lost any of the badger hairs after the initial year of use. Great value!</li>
    <li> First off - I bought this to use to oil my firearms - not to use for shaving . . . ;-)  If anyone is still interested ;-) - it seems to be  well made and was attractively priced.  I use it to spread a light sheen of oil on the outside of my firearms when cleaning them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date - it has worked very well.</li>
    <li> A very good brush at a good price. Well made with a small handle and smooth bristles&lt;br /&gt;Needed to soak over night in water with a few drops of Dawn dish soap to remove the scent but that was all it took&lt;br /&gt;and now I use it everyday and it seems to be holding up well. A good value for the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush going on 4 years now and it&#x27;s excellent. Never store it or let it dry with the bristles up. You need to get a holder that will let the bristles hang down as the brush dries so it doesn&#x27;t damage the part holding it all together. A little bit of care for your tools makes them last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen brushes sell for $50+ and that&#x27;s crazy when this does the trick. You&#x27;ll loose a bristle here and there, but that&#x27;s normal wear and tear. Just remember to store and dry it properly, and don&#x27;t try to strongarm the soap. Get the brush wet and rub it against the soap till a bit of lather forms. I prefer the Proraso shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t try yet, but it looks good, nice materials and well made. It worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have used this brush 5 times since receiving it. The bristles are a matted mess. This brush isn&#x27;t fit to spread paint! Save your money and buy something else!</li>
    <li> Great brush for the money my first brush lasted me about 3.5 years without taking any care of it whatsoever. Prickly at first and will loose a few bristles but once broken in I got the best shave I  ever did. Highly recommended for beginners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 2 weeks now and it&#x27;s still holding up really well. The first 4 or 5 times I used it, it shed a lot of hairs...A LOT. That has pretty much tapered off at this point. Now it only loses maybe one or two hairs per shave. I would warn anyone with really sensitive skin that this brush is pretty stiff, which was surprising to me. But, I like the scratch on my face. This is a great brush for the price and you won&#x27;t find a better one at this price point. After a few more weeks of shaving, I think I will upgrade, but I will definitely keep this brush for as long as it holds together.</li>
    <li> This brush loses color and drops a lot of bristles. Hopefully it will slow down after a couple more uses.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wooden handled shave brush.  It gets wet.  A lot.  The handle just didn&#x27;t last, for me.  The bristles are OK, not great, but serviceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just testing the waters of wet shaving, you could do worse.  But, you&#x27;ll want something much nicer soon (and, trust me - it&#x27;s worth it).</li>
    <li> Definitely 5out f 5 for 15$ I got one off ebay for 8$ shipped,  it beats soft soaps up quick! It worked on my vdh soaps to but id stick to soft like proaso and other nicly priced soaps, smallish but so are my vulfixs,  this works as well as some of my 40$ brushes! Buy this or van der hagen badger u just can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I picked this up when i decided to switch to double edge razor shaving about a year ago and I&#x27;ve hung onto it even after going back to normal disposable blades.  The handle is of good quality and the bristles feel great on my face.  I&#x27;ve used it daily since I bought it and see no signs of wear at all.  It spreads the lather nicely and the ergonomics are good i.e. it feels good in my hand.  The only thing I can complain about is the fact that the hairs come out.  Not enough to notice the depletion in looking at the brush or feel a difference in the function but, enough to notice and this can be a bit of a problem when they get stuck in between the blades causing an uneven shave.  Over all it&#x27;s a good product and the hair loss isn&#x27;t enough of a problem to warrant returning or replacing it.</li>
    <li> So far no problems.  I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now and it is doing just fine. As long as it continues holding up I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Good brush for what you pay for its lost some hair but not much. The brush lathers very well, I&#x27;ve been happy with it so far if it last for a descent time I&#x27;d probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> Now this is a good shaving brush. The badger hairs mix up a very good lather with either shaving soap or regular soap. I prefer \\&quot;Octogon Soap.\\&quot; Why? Because it deep cleans your skin as it smoothens your beard for shaving. The Tweezermans brush also spreads a thick, rich, lather uniformly over your face; better than a clumsy can of shaving cream which I always hated! Men, sometimes a step backwards is a good step! This brush is a very good buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for my dad (who still shave&#x27;s old school) and he just loved it.  He really bragged about it.  I am so happy I found it and it was very affordable too.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re only dipping your toe in the area of wet shaving, this brush is \\&quot;OK\\&quot; for a start but not much more than that. It loses hairs after every use. The hairs have been trimmed  to make the shape and it is \\&quot;scritchY\\&quot; on your face. NOT representative of a good badger hair brush and there are probably better boar hair brushes out there at his price point.</li>
    <li> i bought this because i was new to the double edge shaving process and really wanted to get the full experience.  i also didnt want to pay $75-300 like a lot of the other brushes, you definitely get what you pay for here, the bristles are not nearly as soft or high quality as some of the fancier brushes ive seen in stores, but it gets the job done and is good for beginners.</li>
    <li> Nice quality brush for shaving soap lather.  Combined with the shaving bowl, col. conks famous shaving soap and the safety razor it put my spouse in perfect shape for a good shave.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I first used the&lt;br /&gt;Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set and the brush was a big let down with coarse hairs that were falling out all the time.  These hairs were really messing up my razors blades getting stuck etc.  This Tweezerman brush at 13.50 is awesome. 100% badger hair and no hairs falling out of my brush it works as well as I can imagine.  Im not really sure what you would get from a more expensive brush?  All that is left is for me to decide on a safety razor or straight blade to get out of this spending cycle for modern replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Do not hesitate to buy this brush. I have shaved with a straight razor for over half of my life and done the rounds with some very expensive brushes. This brush stands up to the most trusted brands I have ever used, it truly is well made, holds a great lather and doesnt loose any hair. This price is simply insane for this brush, I wish I would have found this great buy years ago.</li>
    <li> If you consider a Corvette a starter car because it&#x27;s not a Ferrari or a Ford F350 a starter truck because it&#x27;s not a dump truck then yes, this is a starter brush. You can purchase more luxurious and use-specific brushes but that doesn&#x27;t take away from the quality of this brush. The $60 Parker silver tip chrome handle on this site is no where near as good a brush and cost four times more. I made the mistake of thinking this is a \\&quot;starter\\&quot; brush because of the price and some of the reviews on this site. Yes, it&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to what&#x27;s out there but that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll outgrow it and want or need a more expensive brush.     Personally, I left this brush in the shower every day for months, most of the time resting bristles up. I just give it a good shake and it&#x27;s held up great. Not a single hair has fallen out and despite being left in a damp shower it&#x27;s still in perfect condition. The water has not affected the wood or glue one bit.  One thing I won&#x27;t do is leave it in a closed ziploc bag when wet when travelling. I assume that would be bad.      Other than that, the best advice I can give to anyone using a brush is soak it in warm/hot water for a few minutes before each use. When done, rinse out all the soap and give it a good shake. Do that with any and every shaving brush. FYI - this brush fits perfectly into the $22 Col. Conk stand available on this site.    Because shaving brushes don&#x27;t cost as much as a Ferrari or a dump truck, I also have some more expensive ones that I do use more often. I won&#x27;t name them because you don&#x27;t need to spend more money to get a better shave. The only thing \\&quot;starter\\&quot; about this is the price, not the quality. I&#x27;m not trying to talk you out of a specialty brush, I just don&#x27;t want you to feel you \\&quot;need\\&quot; one to get a better shave. Experiment with blades, razors, soaps, creams, oils and aftershaves first. If you have any money left and you still feel like it, then feel free to \\&quot;upgrade.\\&quot; Keep in mind that the bigger the brush the more likely you are to get shaving cream up our nose or in your ears.      Bottom line, the Tweezerman brush makes a great gift or even an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; for yourself. Happy shaving.</li>
    <li> As I stated in the title, great low cost quality brush.  Not much else to say about it.    You will lose a few hairs in the beginning, that is normal.  I have used it now for 2 months and love it. Just take care of it and it should last a good long while.    Rinse with clean water then gently squeeze out excess; let air dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for 4 or 5 years.  After 20 years of a bristle brush, this is luxury.  The brush is full and soft and I only occasionally notice a lost hair in the shaving mug.  The only issue I had was that when I first used the brush, the badger musk nearly knocked me over.  Two weeks of use washed all of the scent (except for my shaving soap) out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush all most 2mths.now and every single time I use the thing it loses hair and not just a couple. I&#x27;m no expert at DE shaving but it drains some of the joy this type of shaving gives me when I&#x27;m constantly picking hairs from the mug and off the face.For me, I wish I would have saved the money and bought a descent 25-30 dollar brush. Good luck and happy shaving</li>
    <li> I used a cheap drugstore brush with Nylon bristles for years and didn&#x27;t think the type of brush would make any difference, but for a few bucks more the difference is amazing. Better lather, application, and beard prep. I also switched to an old fashioned safety razor and the shave is closer, more comfortable, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly. After 35 years goodbye shaving industrial complex.</li>
    <li> Too many lost and loose bristles with each shave.  I used this daily for two months and each time had at least 2-3 long bristles come out of the brush and into my shaving cream.  The bristles were on the prickly side.  The handle began to deteriorate after about a month (cracked and began to peal) and was unsightly, although still functional.  [[ASIN:B005F1RRUK Pure Bristle Shave Brush (VS/5) shave brush by Vulfix]] is a better alternative at this price point: it is less irritating (prickly) and does not lose bristles nearly as much. I&#x27;ve had it for several years and it still does the job very well.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of good reviews of this brush but this isn&#x27;t going to be one of them.  This is a cheap product and mine sheds hair like a dog.  Thats fine but I don&#x27;t like hair constantly falling out on my face or beard or having to pick them out of my shaving soap constantly.  Save your money for a nice brush.</li>
    <li> It is usable but that is about all I give it credit for. It pokes my face a bit and is just overall rough. It works though and for the price you can&#x27;t really complain. I bought a boars hair brush at a swap meet and I like that one much better than this.</li>
    <li> Best value in a brush.</li>
    <li> A good brush. It does a good job of creating a good lather with the soap.</li>
    <li> The biggest issue is that every time I use it, some of the bristles come out and onto my face.  I was using a left-over makeup brush (from a film shoot) and it was better than this.  Also, the bristles are hard.  I will keep a look out for another in future.  I give it 2 stars as the handle is nice.</li>
    <li> I only have the Old Spice brush I used over 30 years ago, but this brush does everything I would have expected.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush so I can&#x27;t really compare to others.  I can say it feels good on my face and holds a lot of lather.  However,  it does lose 2-4 hairs every shave.  Not sure if that&#x27;s normal or not,  but it isn&#x27;t a deal breaker IMO.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush. The badger hair generates lather very well. Inexpensive. Bought one for my son the same time I ordered mine. The only issue I have with this brush is after using it for about 18 months, the finish is coming off the handle right above the bristles. It is washed out with clean water and hung to dry (bristles down) after each use. This doesn&#x27;t affect the use, but looks a little unsightly. Would recommend for someone looking for an inexpensive shaving brush.</li>
    <li> Very good Brush, the best one I have right now.&lt;br /&gt;No shedding of hair, but there is one crack in the handle.&lt;br /&gt;Because it is wood extreme care is needed only to get it wet long enough to&lt;br /&gt;use it to shave then get it dry as soon as possible so it won&#x27;t crack any further.&lt;br /&gt;Next brush will have to have a non-wood handle.</li>
    <li> At first, the brush was shedding like crazy because of how I was using it. I was hanging it to dry as recommended, but was using it with a silver bowl. I believe the silver bowl&#x27;s shape was destructive to the brush. Realizing this, I dedicated a coffee cup to the task. I put a puck of shaving soap into the coffee cup and leave it there. A splash of water and lotion on top of the soap in the cup and a few swirls of the brush and I have a very nice lather to shave with. I then hang it to dry with the handle towards the ceiling,</li>
    <li> Good brush for the price. After a year it has never stopped shedding though.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews on BB and watching vids on youtube, I had to jump on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is super soft, it feels like some very high end brushes that I have looked at, for 12$ jump on it ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing lathers great, and fast.  It feels great on the face, it exfoliates nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must have been a lucky one, my brush only lost a few hairs so far, and the wood was not cracked when I received it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this March, and it&#x27;s still holding up well. I was contemplating getting a more expensive one but on recommendation of other reviews purchased this instead. It&#x27;s worked marvelously since then. It shed a little at first, but now it just builds great thick lathers. I used both bar and jarred soaps, and both have worked well with the Tweezerman. Just make sure to rinse it off and hang it upside down after use and it should last you.</li>
    <li> The quality is better than I expected but the brush ended up in the garbage after the second use.  Believe it or not, it STUNK TO HIGH HEAVEN.  I understand that the bristles are natural but if a live badger smells like that, no wonder they never caught on as house pets.</li>
    <li> Okay quality. Not much to look at. Brissels are too soft for my taste.</li>
    <li> Quality not what I expected from tweezerman.</li>
    <li> This is NOT what I expected at all!!!  I thought that because it was a badger hair brush as opposed to a boar&#x27;s head brush that it would be something special, however it WASN&#x27;T.  I&#x27;m fairly new to shaving with the DE Safety razor system and my first brush was okay, however it shed with every shave.  I ordered this one, threw out my first brush and wish that I hadn&#x27;t done so!  This brush is rather small (in hand &amp; I have small hands) as well as it doesn&#x27;t fit securely in my stand.  And the WORST part about this brush is that it became matted after the first couple of uses!  Once the soap is lathered into the brush, it goes straight to the middle / knotted portion of the brush and I have to apply it via the center of the brush as opposed to the tips / bristles of the brush.  I HATE IT (and it sheds too)!!!  I don&#x27;t like writing bad reviews about products, but I couldn&#x27;t resist doing so with this product.  I would not recommend this product to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> This product is very good for a very low price. It works just fine the only issue that I hand the brush was releasing particles in the first day of use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first brush. It worked great and felt great. It makes me want to shave more.</li>
    <li> Being new to double edge shaving I needed a shaving good brush. After looking at some of what was available I chose this Tweezerman brush as a way to try the double edge shaving experience and keep my costs down as much as possible. I could buy a more expensive brush later on if needed. After using the brush for about a month I can say it&#x27;s doing exactly what it designed to do.I don&#x27;t see any reason to spend 3 or 4 times what I spent for this brush. It&#x27;s a great value, give it a try.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good badger brush for the price, and I don&#x27;t think a buyer would be disappointed with it. It lathers well, and seems durable.  However, the pure badger hair used on this brush is a little prickly, which becomes an annoyance after a while. The handle is quite small, so if you enjoy bowl lathering, prepare for things to get a little messy.  As an alternative, I would recommend an Omega boar brush, for less money. My Omega Pro 49- about $15 on Amazon- was softer than the Tweezerman from day one, and is only getting better, as the ends of boar bristles split with use, making the brush softer. Well broken in boar brushes become incredibly soft, and still have lots of backbone for face lathering.[[ASIN:B000CB8Q4Y White Handled Omega Professional Boar Hair Shaving Brush]]  Maybe some day I&#x27;ll get a really nice silvertip badger brush. Until then, the little Tweezerman will still be used occasionally, just not as often as the Omegas.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush to use while traveling.  It is everything I&#x27;d wanted!  It&#x27;s small enough to go in my shaving kit for travel.  The bristles are soft and spread nicely, holding the lather well.  In general it performs almost as well as my much more expensive badger bristle home shaving brush.</li>
    <li> I made the switch to safety razor shaving, and this brush is now part of my shaving kit. It&#x27;s a nice size, and really sucks up and retains water and soap. I like how frothy the shaving soap gets when you swish it around with this brush in a mug. When applying it, you can feel your face get warm and stimulated, and your stubble being pushed outwards for a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a slight musky odor, but it&#x27;s not strong and will probably fade over time. A few hairs have come off as well, but again I think this is normal at first. The brush has to \\&quot;get used to\\&quot; being swirled around in hot water and cream. I set it on its side to dry, but there are stands you can buy to hang it so the brush part drips downward.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m buying something else because this brush literally stinks and my bathroom reeks like ferret. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week hoping the soap makes the odor go away. I&#x27;m done and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush is great.  My husband has had it for over a year now and it is still as soft as the day he bought it.  It hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles with use and he loves the lather he gets from using it.  Highly recommended product- quality at a fraction of the price of other boar brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush was purchased through amazon.  I didn&#x27;t expect a great brush for the low price and I didn&#x27;t get one.    This was what I expected for a $15 badger brush.  It&#x27;s still somewhat better than a $10 boar bristle.    Would be OK for a travel brush if I didn&#x27;t already have one.  I&#x27;ll keep this one in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have used these brushes for years with no problem. One thing no one has mentioned is that if you have a problem with the brush you can send it to the manufacturer and they will replace it, no questions asked. I found this out last year when my brush came out of the handle. I contacted them and they sent me a new brush. When Tweezerman says lifetime guarantee, they mean it.</li>
    <li> When I got this a few days ago I was happy with purchase as I thought it look and felt good for the price.  Day one cleaned it with shampoo and used it, worked OK but sheds hairs like hell.  Day two used it again and no longer happy with it as the brush sheds hair like a long hair dawgg.  Day three used it again and it still shedding like hell, this brush sheds more hairs than my two dogs together, there was no day four as I was rinsing it to put it away the head fell off the wood handle.  The amount of hair inserted into the wood handle is barely .5 inch and not glued properly this is not a quality product, like they say you get what you pay for, your mileage might vary with this product... To me is not even worth trying to sent it back.    \\&quot;I would not recommend this brush to anyone\\&quot;    Back to using my father&#x27;s forty years old brush, the head is not as full as I remember it as a kid but the thing don&#x27;t shed and it is still working.</li>
    <li> The brush lost quite a few hairs on its first use, but with proper care hasn&#x27;t lost many more. Expect to lose some when you first break it in, but other than that be sure and buy a stand for it and have it hang bristles-down so it can dry appropriately. It definitely works and isn&#x27;t a bad investment for the money.</li>
    <li> Been using an electric for a few years now, bought a double edge razor to try... and this brush.  With no frame of reference it&#x27;s hard to give a review, but considering the price the fact it works makes it a deal.  The hair is definitely real and I have no reason to believe it&#x27;s not badger.  The quality of construction is good.  It lathers soap well.  All in all this was a great place to start and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get a few years from it.  The packaging is also good enough this could be given as a gift.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, only complaint I have is a few hairs come off during use. Hopefully it will stop soon but other than that, a good brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: A few weeks after using this, the brush separated from the handle. I used little Amazing Goop to get it back together and a day or so to sit, it was fixed. It has held up fine so far, but I am careful whenever I clean the brush. And almost a year later, a few hairs are still coming off during every use.</li>
    <li> Look, if you REALLY think you&#x27;re going to get a good quality badgerhair shaving brush for $10, then you&#x27;re beyond help.  But this one is decent, and its about 1/4 the price of anything else as good.  Sure, you won&#x27;t have the tremendous sense of luxury you get from one of the silver-hair brushes that run from $80 to $800, but you&#x27;re miles ahead of anything else I&#x27;ve seen in this price range.    I bought this brush to take the abuse of being in my travel kit.  Any brush in there, regardless of quality, is going to wear out within a year.  This one is fantastic for that purpose--I won&#x27;t mind buying another one every few months, and it&#x27;s not a bad brush at all.</li>
    <li> I just opened the shipping box which seemed to be in good condition and found ALL of the bristles to be detached from the handle.  The brush is inside a clear plastic box that is unopened and all of the bristles have come loose from what looks like a very poorly executed glue job.  I have since noticed many other folks who have had a similar situation.  Looks like I will have to spend more.</li>
    <li> It is true you get what you pay for! I&#x27;ve used this brush for well over a week and it sheds at least two to three hairs each use. It looses them in the bowl and on my face. At this rate, I will have to buy another in several months.</li>
    <li> Good quality for what you pay for. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now... Bristles come off here and there, not too bad.</li>
    <li> It works well, but does loose hair some. I am guessing that it will last a couple of years based on the rate of the hair loss.</li>
    <li> Have now had my brush for over a year now. Have bought this as a gift for several people now because of how well mine has held up. I will say this though, the brush not may fall out of the handle. But it&#x27;s not a big deal, the brush will stay bundled and with a little bit of epoxy or wood glue you&#x27;re all set. Amazing brush for the price.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few weeks. It does the job but a few bristles come off every time I use it. Does not seem very durable.</li>
    <li> An excellent old fashioned shaving brush with a good warranty.  This is my second one and the first one lasted for years.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my camera gear clean. Does not scratch ant small equipment Light and easy to carry.</li>
    <li> After looking at several brushes, I settled on this one . it had good reviews and I can see why, first its easy to break in and it a badger brush, then I use a cream and it lathers in the brush great would recommend</li>
    <li> Sure, it&#x27;s better than any boar brush I&#x27;ve tried, some that cost more than this.  That said, it&#x27;s not of particularly good quality.  The plasticky finish on the handle is flaking off in chunks in less than two weeks of use.  The knot is sparse, not very large at all, and has a large bald spot in it.  It also stunk to the high heavens until it was washed out a number of times.  I know badger brushes tend to stink a little when new, but this was the worst I&#x27;ve dealt with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really good brush can cost ten times what this does or more, it&#x27;s amazing to see real badger this cheap, but I&#x27;ve heard a lot of really good chatter about these brushes.  Maybe mine was a dud, but I&#x27;ll spring for better next time.</li>
    <li> This is the first Shaving Brush I&#x27;ve ever owned so maybe I&#x27;m just wrong when I assume that these brushes should be bigger, but to even get the brush to the bottom of a standard sized coffee mug you have to insert your hand into the mug, and since my hands are bigger than that of a small child, I have a very tough time getting any lather with it. I&#x27;ve had to resort to using a smaller glass cup, but even then it&#x27;s not much better. I can&#x27;t really recommend you purchase this one over another aside from the cheap price tag, however if you were already looking to get this one I&#x27;d say you should go for it. It works just fine, the size is just smaller than I would personally prefer.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair with clippers &amp; we use this to clean off the excess hair. It works wonders and is a great addition to your haircutting set and is definitely worth the minor cost for the value it provides.</li>
    <li> I have nothing to compare this too because it was my first one but so far its holding up well. I keep it in a stand so it can dry and i rinse it off well. I just wouldn&#x27;t store it in the manner its pictured that cannot be good for it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaving brush for my husband because his old one was losing bristles. The first time he used it, he gave me the &amp;#34;thumbs up&amp;#34; sign and said it was a great shaving brush. I am very happy that he likes it. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush and you will too! I have had this brush for over 2 years now and it is still in perfect working order. I admittedly don&#x27;t shave every day... or every week but it is a pleasure to use. I just make sure to rinse it out completely every time and dry it off vigorously brushing it on my towel.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price</li>
    <li> This one happens to have been a purchase for my Father-in-law, based on the purchase that I made for myself 3 years ago.  Readers makes a great shaving brush!  It is really standing the test of time wonderfully well.</li>
    <li> Supper for lather for a close shave.</li>
    <li> I think this is a high quality shaving brush, but I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I don&#x27;t ever use it. When I DO use it, it sheds badger hair on my face. Also, the shaving cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street brand) foams up better when I just scrub it against my whiskers anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing MIGHT be worth using if I didn&#x27;t shave in the shower every morning, because it&#x27;s probably less messy than using my hand to apply the shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Well, as usual, I got the cheaper item, and ended up with the cheaper quality. There were plenty of glowing reviews, but on the very first use out of the box this thing left so many hairs in my lather bowl and on my face that I had to rinse off a couple of times before I could even shave. Quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving brush. Gave it to my step father for Christmas and for the first time in over 10 years he finally threw away his old standby!</li>
    <li> This brush in use with Proraso Sensitive Shave Soap has been a great experience. This builds a nice lather and foam. A couple hairs have fallen out but that was to be expected. I&#x27;ve been using the brush for about a month now and it&#x27;s stopped shedding.&lt;br /&gt;I dry it hanging with the brush down after washing it out. This seems like a solidly built brush and with proper care seems like it should last for a while.</li>
    <li> This was my first shaving brush and it works great.  I lost a few hairs the first time but none since.  I&#x27;ve been drying it bristles down as directed on the side of the package and by some reviewers here.  I think not doing this is causing  problems for most people.  The handle is comfortable to hold and it does its job.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay up for different one.</li>
    <li> The brush absorbs and holds water on par with some higher end brushes, and exfoliates like it should! However after even the first use the badger hair begins to fall out. Even with delicate care and proper post shave cleaning I cannot foresee this brush lasting a very long time (luckily its always good to have a couple of backup brushes!)</li>
    <li> My husband liked this brush. He still prefers the old method of the mug and brush for shaving. We order his mug soaps from Amazon, too, in bulk.</li>
    <li> The brush works and seems to use decent materials but the hairs fall out and end up on my face and gunking up my razor.</li>
    <li> I have used shaving brushes for about 13 years.  I have had a couple.  I know one was a non-animal bristle and the others were.  I am guessing the later were not badger because this one is different and much stiffer.  I think I am getting more exfoliating action on this one because of that.  Only a couple of hairs fell out on first use.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for the price.  The hairs do have a tendency to fall out , especially at the beginning.  I even have it hanging from a hook like another review mentioned, but the hairs still fall out on occasion and get on my face, or in the sink.  Not a major problem though.  Can&#x27;t beat it for 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> The Tweezerman Badger Shaving Brush is an economical approach to a &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; wet shave. When used with a quality razor and blades, you can have your &amp;#34;barbershop&amp;#34; shave in the comfort of your own home each morning.  Holds it bristles, makes great lather, and feels great on my face. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this just under a month ago. Ever since I used it the first time building my later the hair has been coming out. At first I thought there is always a few loose ones and it will stop.....this morning I has a chunk come out. The handle is cracking the the wood is coming away from the ring that holds the hair. Now I&#x27;m looking for a new one. Cheap, keep looking.</li>
    <li> best ever  john ziegler</li>
    <li> Good brush, but the bristles are a bit too long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not all that fancy, but it feels good, lathers well, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;Mine&#x27;s developed a small crack, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be affecting anything.</li>
    <li> Ok but some of the bristle are really sharp, but it makes a great brush for other projects</li>
    <li> Nice, high quality shaving brush that doesn&#x27;t leave hairs all over.</li>
    <li> For 13$ you can&#x27;t go wrong, I used this the other day and was very soft and whipped up a nice lather.. Its on the small side but still works great I&#x27;m glad I bought it. Nice wooden handle that has a layer of shellac, I don&#x27;t mind because its got a nice shine and makes the wood handle water proof</li>
    <li> They started falling out the very first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Now that is not because of improper care that is just a crappy brush.</li>
    <li> Good price for badger hair brush! But you get what you pay for. No matter what the nasty smell doesn&#x27;t go away and no matter how long you use it for the hairs always fall out.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good brush. It holds water and soap well, and feels great on my face. I had to knock one star off, however, because it sheds bristles on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very careful to rinse thoroughly when I am done, shake it dry, and to store it upside down so the water drips away from the handle. Yet I still end up with bristles on my face when I apply the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it is only a minor annoyance and it is still a good brush. After using it for several months it does not appear to be losing so many bristles as to wear away to the point I cannot use it: it still looks brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more point: this is, apparently, irresistible to cats. I have to store mine in the vanity cabinet on the razor stand so my cats will not bat it around. One time I came home from work and saw it at the bottom of the basement stairs. I careful cleaned it, put it away in the cabinet, and threatened my cats with the Wrath of John if they did it again. Of course I followed that up with a tummy rub, I couldn&#x27;t hurt my kitties.</li>
    <li> Uesed it 4 times and started to flatten out and loosing hair.  You get what you pay for.  It is a cheaper brush.</li>
    <li> Great badger for the price. Yes it smells like a weasel when you get it, but that smell does go away. It also sheds a bit, but it sheds less as you use it. Love it with soft creams and soaps. If you were my friend, I would tell you to try one.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving brush. It is the third brush I have owned and by far the best. It absorbs water well and allows an even application of soap lather to my face. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you have never tried classic wet shaving before you might think about skimping on shaving gear the first time around. I did too but recently, I upgraded all of my equipment and elected to give this brush a try. I can say it&#x27;s the finest brush I&#x27;ve used and though I&#x27;ve not tried those really high-end badger brushes, this one works well. It has badger bristles to hold more water and combined with a good shave soap (not the cheap stuff you buy at discount stores), will give your face a good prep before you shave. My teen-age son recently started using this too so I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy another one soon so he can have his own. It&#x27;s a fantastic brush for the money. It makes your face feel great and holds the soap lather well for a second lather if you want a really close shave. My suggestion is to not skimp on the other stuff. Buy a good stand to hold the brush, a durable double-edged safety razor, and some quality soap. I bought the Col. Conk kit with a metal stand (holds this brush perfectly), a Parker 22R Safety Razor, and Col. Conk Super Size Shave Mug with Almond Soap. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great cream brush.  Soaps, not so much.  For soaps, you can get a nice bore brush with lots of backbone for the same money as this.  Again, this is my go to brush for creams though.</li>
    <li> The brush itself is ok, but when I received mine, I realized it must have been stored somewhere around smokers.  At first, I thought the new shave soap I bought smelled like tobacco smoke.  But I tried another scent of shave soap and found the same thing.  I then realized that it was the brush; not the soap.  After many uses and rinses, the smoke smell has disappeared, and I like the brush very much.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a decent brush - as per previous reviews it&#x27;s a good value for a badger brush. I&#x27;ve used mine a couple times now and it has a pretty strong odor when it&#x27;s wet. I&#x27;m hoping that goes away with time. I&#x27;ve noticed a few stray bristles being shed, but it&#x27;s not excessive. Be sure to get a brush stand so that you can dry it properly. Instructions on the box say you can&#x27;t dry it standing as it&#x27;s shown in the product picture.</li>
    <li> No self-respecting badger would accept hairs like this.  Tweezerman must have plucked them out of the back end of a camel.  No, no cigar for this product flop.  Pay a little extra and get a decent brush.</li>
    <li> I just received my brush and used it for the first time and now know why the name is Tweezerman. I needed a tweezers to pluck the loose hairs that this this brush lost out of my shaving soap, my sink and my face. It sheds more than my dog does. I hope that it will be finished when I use it again. I shouldn&#x27;t have trusted the reviews.</li>
    <li> I bought this Tweezerman brush for my first brush as I jumped into traditional wet shaving. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush. At first the brush seems a little coarse and stiff but after a couple of uses the bristles soften and you see what this brush is really all about. I use some Col. Conk glycerin shave soap and this brush works up a good lather with it. I would give this brush 5 stars but bristles tend to fall out from time to time and to me the Tweezerman logo on the handle makes the brush look ordinary.</li>
    <li> I know a bone or stone handle is what a shaving brush is supposed have but what&#x27;s in your hand doesn&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s what goes on your face that counts. This brush is soft and will whip up a nice lather if you are using a real mug shaving soap in a real mug or cup. I warm the mug with the soap inside under the running hot water while I pre wet my face then with the brush not too wet I whip up the soap to a lather and paint it on my beard working it in real good to get a nice even lather. That soft brush and warm lather feels good on those crisp mornings. For the money you won&#x27;t go wrong with this brush. I wash it out real good when done shaving and hang it bristles down to dry. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it still looks good and works as it should.</li>
    <li> The brush feels great, but some of the badger hair comes out with use. I wish the glue or whatever is holding the hair in was a little better.  I&#x27;d recommend, but I can tell I&#x27;m going to have to replace in about 4 months.</li>
    <li> For this kind of money I love this brush. I&#x27;ve bought two of these in 5 years. The only reason I had to replace the first one was that I failed to keep it dry so the finish on the wood chipped off. Bristles are nice and stiff and make the shave cream lather up nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this for my toiletry kit. When I lost my $70 badger I used this a few times. Not quite as good as top of the line and won&#x27;t last as long but it does do the job. Pro bably not paying $70 again...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell of the brush when wet.  Hairs have been falling out and I have only used it three times. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son who&#x27;s a US Marine. Marines shave everyday. He says this is a must have!</li>
    <li> love it. truly makes you feel amazing while applying the shaving cream, and the bristles are smooth use after use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love using this brush. This is my first brush and it has shed a few hairs but that is probably normal. The shave with TOBS soap was fantastic.</li>
    <li> I originally intended to use this with shaving soap, but I&#x27;m trying to go through my Edge gel for now. Surprisingly, its works really well with the gel shaving cream!. After a few uses, it already started to shows it&#x27;s wear, so make sure to store it upside down. Although its shape is a little distorted now, it still gives me that great exfoliating feel to my face. Plus I feel like Don Draper while I use it.</li>
    <li> Does the trick and makes great lather.  My only beef is that it is still shedding 1-3 bristles per shave, and they usually end up in the lather on my face.  At this rate, it will be dead in about a year, and I could have used the money to buy a slightly nicer, but longer lasting brush.  But for the price and for a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; brush, it was worth the price, especially because I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like using it (which I do).</li>
    <li> i was Very satisfied performed as expected. hairs did fall during few uses afterwards it stopped. will most definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Since I just received this brush, I will give it 5 stars. The quality seems good,and I am pleased with the product,  but I will upgrade my review as I see how it stands up to the test of time. Spending $10.00 on a small brush, I am expecting it to hold up well. I understand there are many more expensive brushes out there, but it is still only a shaving brush, and that alone isn&#x27;t worth much more than $10 for the job at hand.</li>
    <li> If you are starting out into wet shaving i would recommend this brush. It is not the best brush but for beginner you probably will be rough on this brush and wont mind when you need to replace it in a year.</li>
    <li> Finally bought this for my husband birthday gifts after reading all the reviews on here.  He tried it for the first time and loved it, infact he loved it so much we will be ordering a few more as xmas gifts this year for his brother!  Yay for tweezerman!</li>
    <li> I bought this at the end of August (just under 2 months ago), and it worked very well for about 6 weeks or so.  Earlier this morning, I go to shave, and the entire knot of badger hair fell out from the wood. It just completely separated from the handle.  Very disappointed in this product, considering it has been under 2 months and I already need to get a new brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is of very nice quality and gets the job done. I don&#x27;t think you can do better for the price and in fact, a more costly brush will do nothing better other than lighten your wallet.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with this brush for about 2 months. The quality of the hair seemed to be sufficient and provided a great lather. Unfortunately, after 2 months the whole wad of bristles fell out of the base :/  Because of this, I can&#x27;t recommend it. I&#x27;ll pay the extra couple bucks for a higher quality one I suppose.  EDIT: I just received the brush I ordered as a replacement: [[ASIN:B002ET1ATU 100% Black Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Blue Wood Handle &amp; Free Stand - From Parker Safety Razor]], and it is leagues above my old Tweezerman brush. The bristles are much softer and hold water/lather so much more effectively. The difference is so distinct that I wonder if the Tweezerman brush might actually be boar&#x27;s hair instead the fair superior badger hair!</li>
    <li> A great quality brush at a really good price. You could spend more.  Go ahead.  However, for those that want quality and value this will serve you well. Pair with the Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand (as I did) and you are in line for a satisfying experience.</li>
    <li> For the money its as good as it gets.I still use the first 1 I bought a few years ago.The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the cost of the brush on amazon has increased a little to much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally a pretty harsh critic, but this brush for the twelve bucks or whatever is a very good deal when compared to badger brushes costing hundreds of dollars. Maybe those are the greatest things ever made but I&#x27;ll never know because for the money this brush works really well. It holds enough water easily to develop a nice lather on a hard shave soap, and it&#x27;s stiff enough to raise the stubble like you want to when shaving. It&#x27;s not the softest brush ever, but I don&#x27;t think you want it to be. It did lose some hairs for the first few months, but not that many. It did also have a rather strong badger odor to it when wet, but that eventually went away. That would be my one quibble with the brush that it would be nice if they would improve. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and it&#x27;s held up well, though I do hang it up upside down on a stand like you&#x27;re supposed to so water doesn&#x27;t sit on and break down the adhesive. I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because of the value for the money. Along with an inexpensive razor like [[ASIN:B001VD7VIY Double Edge Razor LORD Chrome ---GREAT VALUE---]] and some decent blades or a straight razor, it&#x27;s a great way to get into wet shaving. Every guy should try it instead of being in the \\&quot;now with 5 blades!\\&quot; cartridge rat race. Try a blade assortment to find out what type of blades you like if you go with a double edge razor. I&#x27;ve found wet shaving to be so much better than shaving with disposable cartridges that I&#x27;m considering going to a straight razor.</li>
    <li> I have read several negative reviews about this product. Some have said that it starting loosing bristles shortly after purchasing it. What I have found after a months use is that it holds up pretty well. It is my first shaving brush and I am happy with the purchase. For the price you can beat it.  Norman Fulkerson  Author: [...]</li>
    <li> An all around good brush. I find that it holds water well, has a decent knot size, and builds a nice lather.  It sheds here and there, but nothing I would describe as excessive. It&#x27;s the perfect brush for someone who wants to try out wetshaving but doesn&#x27;t want to drop a ton of money on their first kit.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush for the price.  Smooth and sturdy.  Cheaper than big box stores and better selection here.</li>
    <li> Good brush. Kind to my body parts.</li>
    <li> Works so well.  Cheaper than I could find in store.</li>
    <li> Lasts and lasts. No smell</li>
    <li> This is my first badger hair shaving brush and it gets the job done but I don&#x27;t like it as much as my boar hair brushes. To me the knot seems loose, like it may fall out of the handle at any moment.. And even after a few months it still sheds a lot. It&#x27;s a good starter brush for a fair price, but I will be looking to upgrade soon.</li>
    <li> If this is badger hair It must have been a petrified one!  It was like soaping up with a steel brush.  Way over priced at $18.00.&lt;br /&gt;I got a great one at Walgreens for $8.00.</li>
    <li> I will invest more money in a shaving brush next time. This was inexpensive, and i know very little about brushes so i tried it. My husband is happy with it, but I&#x27;ve noticed it loses hairs with each use. If this stops over time I&#x27;d buy it again. It is soft (but firm) and looks nice   (updated January 2016... not only has it not stopped with time, but the shedding has increased. I&#x27;m giving up on this one and investing in another brand. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned:  First, there are all different types of bristles. synthetic, horse hair, badger, boar bristle...Good for different types of soaps or shaving creams, and also different types of beards. Who knew? Some arrive smelling like a dead animal, apparently, but I never had that problem with this brush. It smelled neutral. I&#x27;m not actually particularly worried about bristle type right now. I just want to find a quality brand that doesn&#x27;t shed excessively.   second: care and storage of the brush can affect shedding and fiber breakage and resiliency, although in the case of this brush, I have cared for it and stored it as recommended... I think its knot is defective.   third: I found some basic brands to check out. Within brand names there are often different sizes of brushes, with different uses. bigger is not necessarily better. (I like the size of this one, very usable.Smaller is not necessarily better either. In fact, beware of very small brushes. Check the size when ordering if possible. Within brands there is often also a huge range in price. Ive found very inexpensive to hundreds of dollars.   Some brands I&#x27;m looking at: Simpsons, Omega, Kent, Parker, and... the one I&#x27;ve just ordered, Muhle.)  I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This shaving brush does the job. Unlike other reviewers I did not find any problem with hairs falling out of the brush. One or two fell out the first week but not for the remaining two months I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> Full, soft bristles. Sheds a little in the beginning, but not exorbitantly. Whips up a rich lather. Made in Solingen, Germany, not you know where. For the price, you simply cannot beat it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a good shaving brush to jump into first but after two months of use it is still losing a few bristles with almost every single use.  It&#x27;s become really annoying to scoop bristles out of my shaving mug, off my face, and off my razor.</li>
    <li> Great quality and very affordable. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase! Bought the FS Black Brush and Razor stand and Merkur Model 180. Every looks great!</li>
    <li> So the hairs in this brush don&#x27;t tend to deform or fall out, but... it kind of stinks... not the rotting pork smell of the boar hair brushes, but still it&#x27;s pungent.  Exfoliates the skin and spreads the cream well, though...</li>
    <li> The hair broke from the handle within a few months. I got Escali brand after that, and have no complains. Would not get this brand again.</li>
    <li> Bristles fell out at a rate of 5-6 per shave for about a month but now after a year, I never lose any bristles. Great brush for the money.</li>
    <li> Very good brush it is soft, has a good feel in hand and makes a great lather but one thing I can&#x27;t stand is the smell the brush has. Washed it many times before i used it with different types of soapand it still has a gamey scent to it</li>
    <li> The hairs fall out.  Yes, I am drying it by hanging it upside down on a shaving stand.  No, I do not push it hard against my face or when lathering in the porcelain bowl (I use Taylor shaving cream).    No matter what I do, it sheds worse than an old farm dog.    Follow up:  The shedding has gotten worse, not better.  Drying, not drying, shaking, etc.---nothing helps.  This morning I lost at least a dozen hairs.  Let&#x27;s face it:  this is cheap junk.  Avoid.</li>
    <li> Junk.  Maintained exactly as required...rinse, hang, etc.  Holding by the top of the bristles to lather, the wooden handle just came off in my hand. Big glob of glue holding bristle ring in the top of the handle.  Now I have to glue the whole thing back together again.  Another example of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t be cheap...your not supposed to have to buy a new brush every six months...</li>
    <li> Cheap and great for it purposes</li>
    <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It works quite well but it&#x27;s been losing a few bristles per shave for the last year.  I thought that this would end after a few months of use, like a paintbrush.  But I&#x27;m still waiting...</li>
    <li> Say that 10 times fast! I picked this little gem up because my Baxter Best Badger Brush was too soft for some of the harder soaps that I use. The Baxter is a fine brush but it is way soft and flattens too easily. This one really stands up to the harder soaps. I can build an amazing lather with it. Like others have said it does shed a little the first few shaves but after that I only get an occasional hair in my cream. The smell goes away after a couple of shaves and was not that bad to start with. It is not as soft as the Baxter either. It&#x27;s a little picky at first but it does smooth out a bit. But hey, it&#x27;s a steal at this price! You should not expect it to be as nice as a $50+ brush. So no, it&#x27;s not better than a Baxter&#x27;s Best Badger Brush but it serves it&#x27;s purpose and it does it cheap.</li>
    <li> I received this brush very quickly and put it to use immediately. I was able to make thick, rich, lather in a short period of time.  It loses a few bristles here and there, but it hasn&#x27;t been an issue yet.  Very satisfied with theperformanceso far.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome for the money, not the cleanest or the most impressive; but it&#x27;s really good for a starting brush.</li>
    <li> Does its job perfectly even after hundreds of shaves.</li>
    <li> Brush worked well while it lasted. I took good care of it as mentioned in the instructions but after 7 months the knot came out from the handle. I am going to contact Tweezerman for a replacement.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent value for the money.  My only complaint is very small - during the first use it did lose a few bristles, but only a few.  The size &amp; feel are very nice and it works great.  The wood color is as pictured - very light. Five stars for the outstanding value.</li>
    <li> What can I say, It&#x27;s a brush right? A brush that&#x27;s pretty cheap right? Like the one you can get at the drug store (yes they sell them there too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this is the same price as the one at the drug store HOWEVER, it&#x27;s a million times better. This is BADGER hair, the one at the drug store is Hogs hair, yes man HOG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who do you think would win the fight? Honey Badger or Pig?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kid, I kid...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this brush is great for the money, and it is real badger hair. If you don&#x27;t trust me, that&#x27;s cool. Get this one and the one at your local drug store, let me know whatcha think.</li>
    <li> Brush is a little better than expected.  It is not equal to a $200 brush, but it cost much less.  Better than boar hair.</li>
    <li> does its job well. lifts the beard up and produces a nice shave. it loses a hair or two with every shave even though i treat it as a shave brush should be. it not much of a complaint</li>
    <li> Great brush, great price. Cannot buy individual brushes in drug stores anymore. You have to buy a brush, mug, soap set and I use the brush with canned shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I was a bit weary about purchasing such a cheap badger hair brush, but after 3-4 years of use it is still getting the job done. It does lose the occasional hair, but it still seems full and functional. All-in-all I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have had a few brands and this Tweezerman is still holding up wonderfully unlike my others!  About a year now with this guy and I get a great shave everyday! Great price as well....</li>
    <li> Really good brush lathers nice and does what it was made for only small downside is in the start it smells like wet animal but a couple of passes in a nice smelling shave cream should change that</li>
    <li> great brush!!  Very little shedding and comfortable to use hold</li>
    <li> Using this and shave soap gives me the best feeling shave! I use it with my Schick hydro and it feels great!</li>
    <li> This product really does what many others do but with far less of their costs. Would for sure purchase again though it looks it will last for a long time. Great product.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Have been using this brush for about 4 months and love it. Works great. Gets softer with time. Very usable and seems to last if you use a brush hanger, shake all water out after use and let it dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I have only used this brush once but I will update my impressions as I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received Brush: Smaller than I had imagined (this is my first brush so obviously impressions will change as I get more experience with this, and other brushes) - the rounded ball part of the handle is 3/4 the size of a golf ball, very light. Wood handle may be a bit darker than picture. Ring may be more gold than in picture. Bottom edge may be not rounded as in picture. Not bad though. No bad smell. Not super soft but not too stiff either. Not silky. True to description and expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use: Quite a few bristles came off (about 25) - didn&#x27;t affect the use but just so you understand this will probably shed hairs the first couple times you use it - I would think this is normal. Brush is stiffer than I expected but it hasn&#x27;t been broken in. Worked ok with Proraso shaving cream and developed an ok lather but had to really whip it for a minute (probably more technique and experience than the brush). Shed hairs in lather were noticeable but not a real issue, think the shedding will greatly reduce or stop after a day or two. Seems like a great first brush and a cheap way to get into using a brush for shaving. If I don&#x27;t come to love it, I could give this to my 16 year old as his first brush (or use it for travel).</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how this stacks up against other badger brushes, as this is my first , but this beauty is a gem! Decided to get another brush rather abruptly after the middle bristles on my Boar Bristle fell out.  Talk about a harbinger... Panicking, I searched the internet for reviews on brushes, trying to balance cost with function.  This brush seemed to be the best value, as several other reviewers attested.  It looked alittle small in the pictures and I was relieved when I got it that it was just right.  Dries out almost immediately after a light shake while suspended in it&#x27;s holder.  I am happy I purchased this one!</li>
    <li> I had an Escali shaving brush before this one, and it lost hairs continuously throughout the month I used it, up until the very end when the handle fell off and it became unusable. So I needed an alternative, and one that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank, so naturally I got this Tweezerman. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, and in that time it has lost less hairs than the Escali did on the very first day. The knot seems thicker to me too, which is good, since it means there is more hair in the brush to hold water and lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It builds an excellent lather, it holds water and lather extremely well, it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand, and soft yet bristly enough on the face that it makes shaving a very pleasant experience. Really, the only complaint I can even think of is that when just removed from the package, the brush had an unpleasant odor. This is likely the \\&quot;badger odor\\&quot; that all such brushes are known to sometimes have. But it&#x27;s a very minor problem, since all that is required to fix it is to break in the brush. This is accomplished by soaking it in water, and then building a thick lather, and leaving the brush in it for an hour or so. If necessary, this process can be repeated a few times. Doing so removes the unpleasant odor from the brush and makes it smell like the shaving soap/cream instead, and also makes the hairs softer and feel more luxurious on the face. It&#x27;s a great brush, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap yet quality shaving brush to start with. There&#x27;s certainly no better alternative on Amazon, and I haven&#x27;t seen any available elsewhere on the internet.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. My first badger hair brush - huge difference compared to a regular bristle brush. The quality was very good. They cost at least $30 on Tweezerman website.</li>
    <li> It is true that it sheds, but it is the first couple of times. After 10 shaves it never shed a hair again! This brush is for life, very durable, very soft, very, very , very good piece of work! Buy it and you will be thankful! And I don&#x27;t see why you won&#x27;t have it for all your life if you take care of it. Store it on the side or upside down, never with the hair pointing up. As with everything else, if you take care of it, it will serve you well. And there is ABSOLUTELY NO reason why you have to spend more money on a brush, this is as good as the $100 ones, trust me!</li>
    <li> Understandably, this is a $9 brush. Figure I&#x27;d get that out of the way first. For the price, and for a budget shopper, this is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Problem:&lt;br /&gt;Under VERY light use, the bristle bunch broke from the handle in roughly 6 months - I don&#x27;t shave on the weekends unless I&#x27;m going out, and don&#x27;t always shave every weekday, depending on the schedule. I probably average 3-4 shaves a week. The bristles are held in by a glob of glue, and pressure from the being essentially forced into the handle. I&#x27;ve seen other brushes break, but if I were desperate, I could use it anyway because the ring is still holding them together... not going to fly with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this issue, I do give Tweezerman credit that bristles rarely shed after the first month, until finally the entire unit came loose. The bristles were also a bit rough until broken in (a month or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this I have no complaints, but this time I&#x27;ve paid an extra 50% to get a better brush with better reviews (~$14)</li>
    <li> This fell apart within 2 months of using it.</li>
    <li> this brush works fine, but i have one major problem with it. It stinks. It stinks, like it came fresh from the badger&#x27;s ass. Which it probably did. So not only do i feel bad about the badger every time i shave, i also feel like i&#x27;m slathering my face with badger manure as the smell totally overpowers my soap scent. I&#x27;ve washed and rinsed it repeatedly and that smell is only slowly fading. I might go back to synthetic bristle brushes.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of other reviews.  Not too shabby. It did have a few loose hairs initially, but no problems thereafter.  I&#x27;ll probably by a better one later on if I don&#x27;t go back to Barbisol.</li>
    <li> I think the only reason this brush rates so highly is because its cheap, and people don&#x27;t know any better. Before I knew what I was doing, I thought well of this brush. After upgrading to a quality brush, I realize just how poorly it performs. This brush smelled terrible for the first few months.  It had that terrible badger smell linger even after soaking and washing and daily use. It sheds constantly. I have owned it for almost 2 years and now only use it as a travel brush. The bristles are very hard nd don&#x27;t lather nearly as well as others. They don&#x27;t hold heat or water well. The paint began chipping off and the wood began to discolor after only a couple months. I always hung it to dry, so there is no excuse for that. If you are reluctanto spend the money, it is better than nothing, but I recommend simply starting with a quality brush instead.</li>
    <li> Good enough. Switched to art of shaving shave brush and it&#x27;s so far better than this one.</li>
    <li> This is what ill looking for and now i got it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> when i got this brush, i thought this is a good quality brush!&lt;br /&gt;but i was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;the first time i tried, already started to falling out.&lt;br /&gt;however, its very soft and fine to use but, still not good quality!</li>
    <li> Just a couple bristles were lost during the first shave - no more than hubby&#x27;s good silver-tip badger brush! No bad smell and it&#x27;s not coming loose from the handle yet. (It is kept in a stand and it&#x27;s shaken well before it is put away.) We&#x27;ll definitely update if problems arise, but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be the perfect for a DE shaving beginner or for travel. It&#x27;s cheap enough that you won&#x27;t cry if you lose it, and you won&#x27;t wince if your pubescent teen flings it into the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS...If you are one of those guys that is still buying over-priced crummy cartridges for those over-priced disposable razors, don&#x27;t be shy!! Grab one of these, some Proraso shave soap, a Merkur blade, some Feather or Merkur blades (for just pennies each!) and give it a try.  (Those disposables have 3-6 blades for a reason - they stink!!) Look up how-to on the web. Tons of great video out there about DE shaving. Your dad and grandfather had the right idea when they went to the barber for a shave - there&#x27;s nothing like it!! My husband is really glad he went back to DE shaving - his skin is much healthier and my sons are saving oodles of money! All the girls in our house also DE shave (Cremo creme for us) and we love it. I cringe when I think of all the $ we spent on cartridges - and all for crummy shaves! Give it a try - pamper yourself!</li>
    <li> The shaving brush fell apart when I took it out of the box. I tried unsuccessfully to repair it with Goop. This is a worthless product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the BS- I did and bought a brush who&#x27;s hair started falling out on the first shave. I let it dry bristles down on a brush stand after every use, I apply gentle pressure when lathering up the soap, and yet it still sheds hair like my overweight cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crap purchase.</li>
    <li> Purpose: It spreads shaving cream on your face...&lt;br /&gt;10 $ is a fair price for a luxury like that.  When I see 60, 70, 150$ brushes, I sometimes question if people are aware of its true purpose. - well I stated the purpose right above , and this does that job excellently for a price that is quite fair.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Like some of the other reviews for this product, I have to give this brush low marks. I used it for the first time this morning with Proraso shave cream. I immediately noticed bristles being left behind in the container. Following the packaging instructions I dried the brush hanging upside down. At the end of the day I noticed that more bristles are ready to fall out. For the price I guess it makes a good first brush if you&#x27;re just getting into &#x27;old school&#x27; shaving. But still not happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year, and the knot finally separated from the handle.  It was good while it lasted, and for $10, I guess I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This is kind of cheap. The bristles keep falling out. The bristles are very sharp and poke my face, my Crabtree and Evelene brand brush has not had one bristle fall out and is very soft and doesn&#x27;t poke at all. It works if you don&#x27;t want to spend double/triple for a high quality brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is just soft enough to make a great fine lather for proper shaving, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started shaving with a double edge razor and wanted to use soap. I have been using a bent toothbrush for the purpose. This brush is so easy to make a lather and applying is wonderful. Not messy at all.</li>
    <li> Received the product last week and used it first time today. Bristles are falling out and covered my whole face. Never expected such a bad quality. my $10 are a waste now.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be clear about what this brush is and isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it is not:&lt;br /&gt; -a luxury indulgence&lt;br /&gt; -overpriced&lt;br /&gt; -cheap junk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it is:&lt;br /&gt; -practical&lt;br /&gt; -inexpensive&lt;br /&gt; -pleasurable to use&lt;br /&gt; -a great brush for a beginner or the budget conscious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used one every day for six weeks, and it is as good as the day I got it.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush and works great for making a great lather. Yes, it sheds a bit during the first few uses, but it has not shed much since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do store mine bristles-down which I&#x27;ve read extends the life.</li>
    <li> Just got mine today, already 10 times as soft as the boar brush. Makes a great lather, like the review before mine says take care of it and you don&#x27;t need to upgrade unless you just like collecting brushes ( I could end up like that:) can&#x27;t go wrong folks, buy and enjoy :))</li>
    <li> I just started using one of these a couple of weeks ago. As soon as I wet it the first time, it smelled like a dead animal. If I weren&#x27;t traveling on a tight budget, I would have thrown it away immediately. Since I needed to shave every day, I kept on using it. It took 6-7 uses to get rid of the smell completely. Needless to say, it is not coming back with me on the return journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture-wise, the bristles are inconsistent as if it were a mix of different animals. Some of the brush is quite bristly and I could not recommend it even getting past the smell.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Still works and looks great after 2 years</li>
    <li> What can I say? I love this brush even though it looses a hair or two every time I shave. It holds the water very well, I rest it on its wood handle (upside down- EEK!) and I have not had any problems with it for the past 2-3 years now. For the price of $15 or whatever it was it is very well built. Heck, this has outlasted a visio monitor... Now all I need is a stand...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, I would have given this 5 stars but the hair or two it looses each week is kinda annoying, but at least it is something that is constant... :\ It lost a star for that reason.</li>
    <li> Doubt this brush will last a year.  I have had it for a couple of month now and it is still loosing bristles every time I use it.  I thought at first this was just due to it being new and the loose ones falling out, but after 2 months, bristles still fall out every time I use it.</li>
    <li> The product arrived fairly quickly, in the condition specified, and seems to be working just fine.  Thanks for a great transaction.</li>
    <li> From the beginning I used this brush, bristles continually fell out. After about 2 months of use, the bristles unglued from the handle. This item is very cheaply constructed.    I received a brush as a gift from Crabtree and Evelyn, and it has not disappointed. I have had it now for almost a year -- no bristles fall out, and the bristles are well connected to the handle.</li>
    <li> This is my first brush and I&#x27;ve been quite pleased.  I noticed some bristle loss at first, though I was lathering in my hand.  The loss has gone away since switching to a mug.  It the problem picks up again I may try to exchange.  [...]    Building lather is super easy with a good cream (I use Art of Shaving, Sandlewood).  I have a full mug of lather, enough for 3 or 4 passes if need be, in a minute or so and usually have lather to spare. I don&#x27;t know how soft the bristles are relative to other brushes, but it is comfortable.    Perfect brush for a beginner who needs to worry more about technique than having a really nice brush.  This one will get you through quite nicely.</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Unbelievable value for the price. I wish Amazon had shaving mugs and soaps available for free shipping.</li>
    <li> Great product, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush since I converted to wet shaving 3 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few bristles fell out during the first couple of shaves but nothing since then. Feels nice in the hand and on the face. I create my lather in a mug using Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream and have no problems doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that I think I&#x27;d prefer a chrome handle rather than wood, just to look better with my Merkur razor and chrome stand.</li>
    <li> Like this a lot. I have had a few of whiskers fall out, but nothing major. Overall it is holding up very well. Especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using the cheap shaving brush from Walmart for the last 3 years so i figured I&#x27;d go spend some money and get a brand-name one.  What a joke.  This thing leaves just as much badger hair on my face as it does shaving soap.  Seriously, it sheds like a German Shepherd.  I ditched it and went back to the $6 wally world one that lasts me about 6 months and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Tweezerman brush for a year and a few months.  I remember this brush stank (like a wet badger, I would imagine) when i first got it. That initial offensive odor will wear off with use.  This brush is excellent for the price, and I don&#x27;t foresee a need to replace it for at least another year or so.  Treat it nice, and it will take care of you... for $10 instead of $60 or more for the nicer ones.</li>
    <li> When I initially bought this brush, I had read many reviews about it not holding up well.  Mine has been in continuous use for 7 months and is still fine.  It lost a few hairs when I first bought it, but hasn&#x27;t skipped a beat since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I store the brush with the bristles down, suspended in a holder I made out of a wire coat hanger.  If you want something prettier, they make stands for these as well.  Pointing the bristles down allows for the water to drain out of the brush better, and thus makes the brush last much longer.</li>
    <li> A few reviews state that the failure of this brush is due to improper handling, use, drying, etc.  This may be the cause in many cases, however I believe there is a serious lack of quality control on these brushes.  I have posted pictures showing the separation of my brush from the handle after only 2 uses. The pictures clearly show that the adhesive used was insufficient and did not contact both the handle and the brush. If it would stay together, I imagine this would be a very good product.</li>
    <li> Love it; super soft and looks like it will last for a while. Very good for the price. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Kind of an awful product. First thing was, it turned my shave water brown. Why would they put water soluble dye in a shave brush? Second, I agree with lots of other people that it lost hairs every shave. While there are one or two reviews of the kind that a seller might stick in saying that well, you have to just hold it right and baby it, that&#x27;s only going to convince someone who has never actually owned a good quality shave brush. Young &#x27;uns may not remember this, but shave brushes were supposed to stand up when used by the \\&quot;manly men (and I guess women?) of yore,\\&quot; you know - miners, stevedores, mule drivers, who weren&#x27;t known for their dainty treatment of their gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up tossing mine away. If you figure that I used it maybe five times, that&#x27;s a cost of about two bucks a shave. If I calculate the hourly cost for a ten dollar brush I used for a total of maybe five minutes before going back to my broken-handled old one, it cost me about sixty bucks an hour to shave with this thing. It&#x27;s not a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally don&#x27;t say this, but DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT.  Soaping up your bare hands and rubbing them on your beard will work just about as well.</li>
    <li> The first several times that I used this brush hairs came off it at a worrisome rate. This was both annoying and troublesome, but after about a month of use the problem is gone and I can&#x27;t really tell that anything is missing. I suppose this is par for the course for a badger hair brush at this price point, but that does not make it any less unpleasant to pick stray badger hairs off your face and out of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the brush does what it&#x27;s meant to do, is pleasant to use now that it no longer sheds, and it allows me to use half the shaving cream I needed to use before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 3 months: Shedding has started to increase again and I&#x27;ve decided to get rid of this brush. It was a good way to decide if using a brush was right for me, but now it&#x27;s time to invest in something that doesn&#x27;t leave a pile of badger hair in the sink every time I shave. This brush does not seem to be made to last very long -- I&#x27;ve cared for it properly but it is still falling apart.</li>
    <li> No shave is complete without a badger hair brush and a safety razor! Insist on badger hair, it will change the way you shave! Shave like a man!</li>
    <li> Works well with Art of Shaving and other creams. It has suffered from bristle loss though. Still it has a good shape and stiffness to work in the lather.</li>
    <li> This is an ok shave brush.  It is very rough for a badger haired brush and feels no different than a boar hair brush. I think it probably is a boar hair with just a couple of badger hairs. Company&#x27;s can legally do that as long as they use 3 percent of what they are claiming it to be and that goes for everything even food products! It feels like an old school straw broom on your face. I dropped the brush and it broke where the bristles meet the handle so the sturdiness is somewhat questionable but for 10 bucks what can you expect? I just bought the Van Der Hagen&#x27;s kit for men and it should be here tomorrow (1/11/13). I just opened the Van Der Hagen kit I ordered and the brush is SO soft compared to the Tweezerman&#x27;s. I cant even describe how soft this brush really is. I would never buy another Tweezerman&#x27;s brush EVER. Spend the extra 20 bucks and get the Van Der Hagen&#x27;s Luxury Shave Kit. Take it from someone who has VERY sensitive facial skin. You will not regret it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because the drugstore VDH brush I had was just awful. This brush is night and day from the cheap boar brush; lathers easier, applies a more even lather, and doesn&#x27;t feel like an dried up paintbrush when I&#x27;m lathering. Used it for a few months, and mine does lose 6-8 hairs every time I use it which is pretty annoying. But for $15 I can deal with it until I&#x27;m ready to upgrade to something nicer.</li>
    <li> Best brush on the market for the money</li>
    <li> After a year of using this brush in the shower, water has found the weak spots in the sealant. I prefer the plastic handled brush over this wood one for that reason.</li>
    <li> Works great. No problems here.</li>
    <li> I just couldn&#x27;t wet shave without it. Using your hand doesn&#x27;t get the job done right here.....no pun intended.</li>
    <li> Nice brush.  Sheds a little but does its job well.  If I ever need to replace it, I would replace with another of the same kind.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaving brush to have a backup for the other one that I purchased. I did give it a trial run and it works fine. Correction: I did not give this a trial run at the time of purchase, I just now used it to see how it would work. I have to say that it would be interesting to know what anatomy of the badger they used to get the bristles. It smells like it came from the rear anatomy of the badger while it&#x27;s organs were failing.</li>
    <li> For the money it&#x27;s a great travel brush!!!!</li>
    <li> As long as you don&#x27;t treat this thing like a 3 year old petting a cat it should last. Others have mentioned bristles falling out and the thing only lasting a year. I have had it about a week and I lost a few bristles on the first use... but not much else since. I use a brush stand to store it so I don&#x27;t think it will fail after a year either. It&#x27;s a good buy for sure.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after reading the reviews.  This is my first brush as I&#x27;ve only recently needed one.  I only was able to successfully use it once.  I read up on how to take of these brushes properly and made sure to do so.  A few hairs came loose during the first use, but nothing too bad.  The second time I used this, after a couple strokes of whipping up the lather, the brush separated from the handle.  I&#x27;m attempting to salvage by super-gluing the brush back to the handle, but I&#x27;m not optimistic.</li>
    <li> Nice, smooths brush, gives to your skin a little massage with better shaving result. It much better shaving result using shaving brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaving brush in June 2011.  It worked great for 3 months.  One day I was preparing to shave, and as I wet it under hot tap water, the hair knot just fell out of the handle!  I didn&#x27;t soak the shaving brush (it actually floats anyway); I always rinsed it out with hot water then cold water, and hung it in a shaving brush stand (bristles down) to air dry.  I&#x27;m going to contact the seller to try to get a replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about two weeks now. For the first couple of days I had a few hairs come off of the brush. Once, I broke it in all was good. I definitely recommend this brush as a starter.</li>
    <li> Many have stated they lose the bristles, and in fact I have too but only in the beginning. Now I have no problems, it lathers just fine, and I have not lost bristle in about a year or so. Well worth the value, especially if you are getting into DE or straight edge shaving; or any shaving for that matter.</li>
    <li> Great brush. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months. Just be careful when trying to shake the excess water out of it: I hit mine against the sink (really did a good job of shaking the water out) but the bristle-head popped out of the wooden base and I can&#x27;t get it back in there.</li>
    <li> This makes an excellent starter Badger brush and is of much better quality than many of the other starter brushes.  It has lots of scritch and makes mountains of lather with the right soap or cream.  The brush only shed 1 to 2 hairs the whole time I had it and not another one.  I have since moved on to another badger brush which was much more expensive.  Great brush for the money!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell at all, which was a bonus. It is pretty stiff, which I enjoy, although much smaller than I thought it would be... but that is okay. Since I don&#x27;t shave my whole face, I found that this is actually just about the perfect size. It has shed a bit, 3-4 hairs every shave so I am hoping that stops soon.   So besides the price that fluctuates everytime I look at it, this is a great buy. :)</li>
    <li> For the price range, this is a great brush. It appears that others have had issues with the hairs falling out. I haven&#x27;t had any of those problems, and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for several weeks now. It would shed occasionally in the first few uses, but after about 5 shaves it stopped shedding. My only reason I gave 4 stars is that it is not THAT comfortable of a brush, compared to others that I have used. But for the price, it is still a great deal for the wet shaver on a budget.</li>
    <li> This brush was painful to use, had some bristles that felt and looked like long wood splinters. I painstakingly cut out the bad bristles, but it still wasn&#x27;t as good as The Body Shop synthetic bristle brush. So I threw it out. Guess I need to spend more $.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this product is worse than the synthetic counterparties. It does not hold water, so inefficient to do lather.&lt;br /&gt;Not comfortable, aggressive in the face. Spend extra and buy something worthy but if you only have $10 you would be better buying cans.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Bought this brush after using another brand for many years and now will stay with this. I&#x27;m enjoying my shaving now even more then before.</li>
    <li> Nice brush for less than 10 bucks. Provides a decent lather and I will hang it upside down to properly dry and help it last.</li>
    <li> I know that the typical belief is that badger-hair brushes get the best lather, but really, my old boar-bristle seemed to get the job done a lot better, and it&#x27;s cheaper.  Overall, though, this one&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Since this is my first brush, my take my review with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The points that I authoritatively can make are these.  90% of the &amp;#34;animal smell&amp;#34; went away after the first shave.  The smell diminished even more after the second shave.  The bristle loss, as well, was done by the second shave.  I think that it shed only 1 bristle on the third shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opinions: It seems to pick up soap very well, and I can easily manage the water to soap ratio.  It is easy to re-lather between passes, which makes wet-shaving much more pleasant.  The handle is comfortable, but could be improved upon.  The price is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it with a shaving cream yet.  I read through many of the 1-star reviews, and have not experienced any problems with the knot, lingering smell, or sustained shedding.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. This helps to slowly exfoliate the skin. He used to get acne after shaving. His face is clearer and acne has reduced a lot.</li>
    <li> I got this as an intro to wet shave kit.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first brush and I do not know what other brushes feel like.&lt;br /&gt;It was cheap and I think it is a good first brush to experiment with.&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to get a second brush somewhere down the road, but this looks like it is made to last.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks use, the hair stays and does not fall out.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have used it twice and have no complaints. I hope it will hold up and last a while. I have had others (different brands) that eventually the bristles fall out.</li>
    <li> Replaced the brush that came in my Van Der Hagen starter kit and it works much better. Make sure to hang dry it.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 so far. The first broke because I dropped it. Oops! RIP. I loved that one. That brush was not soft and that was how I wanted it. A few hairs came out initially but that is alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got another one and it seemed like this badger conditioned his fur or something because this one was a whole lot softer and a lot fuller! This may sound nice and dandy, but I liked the harsher badger hair made me feel like a real man. Now I feel like I&#x27;m applying makeup using a makeup brush. Also, a lot more hair came out of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall.... It&#x27;s OK. But! It&#x27;s also the best bang for the buck. Get it now ya hear?</li>
    <li> For $13 I guess I cannot complain.  I cannot imagine spending more for such a brush though it is easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush definitely helps stand the stubble up to provide a closer shave, and I use a lot less shaving cream than before so those are positives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However each time I use it, which is every other day, the brush loses a few hairs which are stuck in the shaving cream on my face.  I store it properly in a holder to air dry and hope soon that is stops shedding at some point.</li>
    <li> I like how soft this brush is! Very affordable and it&#x27;s a great product. I hope I won&#x27;t have to buy one of these for a while but if it happens I will for sure buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells kind of funny but works great.  The hairs tend to come out but I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and it&#x27;s still functioning fine.  Does a great job of working up a lather.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday...I have been for about 4 months.  It&#x27;s a great brush at a really good price and seems as though it will last for years.  Like all brushes, if you expect it to last you&#x27;ll need to get a stand that lets the brush hang upside down for drying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for almost two years now, and I don&#x27;t have a single complaint about it, except that when I bought it on Amazon, it was about $8 more expensive. I honestly thought I paid even more than that, and still felt like I got a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a few of the bristles fall out, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I rinse it out well, squeeze and shake it out pretty vigorously after each use, and store it standing upright (bristles facing heaven). I know this is contrary to what most people recommend, but I travel a lot, so carrying around a stand to hang it on is a hassle. Plus, since I picked it up for such a good price, replacing it will not be too big a sacrifice. All that said, I don&#x27;t find an inordinate number of bristles falling out, it still foams up a great lather, and it even escorted me through a deployment in the desert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this brush so much, that I&#x27;m including it in a gift set I&#x27;m putting together for my son for his 13th birthday present. Might as well get him started right!</li>
    <li> Right out of the box this thing sheds like crazy. I know people will blame all sorts of mishandling as the source of the problem but today was the first time I used it and it lost somewhere around 30-40 hairs. I understand new brushes and break-in periods and all that, but this thing isn&#x27;t going to last long enough to be broken in. It&#x27;s really scratchy on the face (I expected it to be for the price) and it&#x27;s falling apart, so I simply cannot see how I could recommend it, even at this price. It simply fails to do what it is meant to do.</li>
    <li> So I read all (most of) the reviews on this brush and went ahead and bought one. I also read at least 15 articles on the proper use of the brush. I shaved with using the brush to lather up on 4 occasions and each time I was busy picking hairs off my face and razor. It dropped at least 10-12 hairs per shave. This made the whole shaving experience a big hassle and not nearly as enjoyable as I&#x27;d hoped for. I will be getting a higher quality brush tomorrow and try again. I don&#x27;t recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> Decided to purchase a Tweezerman&#x27;s shaving brush based of other customers experiences.  Looked like a good product when it arrived; however, I noticed immediately after the first use it was shedding hairs like crazy.  Ended up returning it and buying one from Target since I needed it right then.&lt;br /&gt;I may buy one in the future when I need a new one as I suspect I got a lemon.</li>
    <li> First brush ever purchased and used. Seems good for the price. Just picked up a VDH Boar today , havent had a chance yet to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a travel brush.  It is nice sized for the kit, applies lather well (much nicer than the el-cheapo I bought at Wal-Mart) and dries quickly. I also like the appearance.  It did have a chemical smell out of the box and it did lose a number of bristles early (they all seem to and it declines quickly) but the brush a month out seems to be coming into its own nicely now.</li>
    <li> I just started shaving with a brush and haven&#x27;t really liked it too much.  I started with a small brush from Art of Shaving in their trial package and it was good, but small.  this Tweezerman is full sized Badger hair and seemed nice.  But as soon as i started whisking it some of the hairs started falling out, I was not expecting that. Other than that, it gets a nice lather and works like it should.</li>
    <li> How can anyone not like this brush? It does the job so well, maintains its shape, and goes strong for ages. Oh, and the price! Get this brush. Yes, there are others out there that are better, but you shouldn&#x27;t bother unless you&#x27;re the holier than thou type nobody likes (aka my former boss). Get the brush, dude!</li>
    <li> i Use these brushes to lather up my head when I&#x27;m about to shave it. So far so good and it a lot easier to use rather then using my hands.</li>
    <li> Looked around online and all reviews said that Tweezerman shaving brushes were the way to go.  They were right! The brush holds a great lather and holds up well to continued use.  Next time we need to purchase a shaving brush, it will definitely be a Tweezerman!</li>
    <li> Works well. Have used it for a while.. still works great.</li>
    <li> This was the first brush I owned. I have bought cheaper which fell apart, the synthetic fiber- don&#x27;t even waste your money. Tweezerman bristles stayed soft, for 2 years. Thought I was time for new one, but couldn&#x27;t see spending 35-and up for something that couldn&#x27;t last forever.&lt;br /&gt;When it was time for a new brush I just saved time and bought another tweezerman.</li>
    <li> Has stayed soft with minimal hair loss and no smell. I make sure I wash it out and let it hang bristles down after use and have been very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Purchased as gift for son and he likes the old fashioned way of foaming suds, avoiding throwing out another pressurized can and cheaper price for replacing just the blade and not the entire plastic holder and blade. Environmental impacts are reduced.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush is OK, but it is not as excellent as I believed it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles have begun to splay open from the center when applying shaving soap, and it makes facial coverage a bit of a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I need a new brush, I will look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great he lloves it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the highest quality out there. For someone just starting out or isn&#x27;t to picky it&#x27;s great. Does what any brush should, but it does shed more than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> This is great for when you start getting into wet shaves as I have. It&#x27;s cheap and it gets the job done. It has shed some into my [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shave Soap, Sensitive, 150ml/5.2 oz (147 g) Jar]] that I&#x27;ve been using, not much, but could become a problem after a while. This isn&#x27;t a brush that you can have for years and pass on, I can see this lasting a few years perhaps. After a while of wet shaving you wont want to go back to shaving the way you used to. You will however, want to invest in a better brush, it may cost you more but it&#x27;s worth it. Or you could always stick with this and pay $10 once every couple years if you don&#x27;t want to cough up $60+ dollars on a good brush[[ASIN:B002UB3BF8 Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Chrome Handle) and Free Shaving Brush Stand]]. One thing you will want to invest in is a stand like [[ASIN:B0098NPUGY Chrome Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]], this will keep your brush head pointing down so that it can dry and extend the length of use with your brush. Without a stand your brush wont last longer than a year. Another good thing to invest in is a brush cleaner like [[ASIN:B0016M370G SEPHORA COLLECTION Daily Brush Cleaner 6.75 oz]] so that you can keep all the \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; off of it and keep it sanitized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a noobie entering into the art if wet shaving but I purchased this after some great reviews. There was a slight smell from the badger hair but nothing outrageously unpleasant and it went away after the 3rd use. The shaving cream I use (TOBS sandalwood) basically masks it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First couples uses some of the hair fell out but that was expected. And trust me, it wasn&#x27;t a lot of hair. This thing is packed with badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great soft lather and is nice and soft on the face.  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great Brush Great Value, I store brushes proper and take care of them will see how long it lasts. All brushes eventually just wear out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now. It hydrates &amp; lathers up quickly, and rinses out easily. It still loses a hair now &amp; again, but for the price I love it. Throw out your cans &amp; go shaving soap &amp; brush!</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price and fits my holder just fine.  I would purchase again.  It is a little lightweight compared to what I am used to though.</li>
    <li> Does just what it should, seems to keep shape well when hung in rack upside down to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should be durable, reading others&#x27; reviews.</li>
    <li> I like the brush, works well with Proraso soap.  Once I was able to get the loose hairs out, the brush works great. Seems like my beard is softer and using.</li>
    <li> This brush was great until it fell apart after two months. The bristles were nice and soft, it cleaned easily, but yesterday all the bristles came out of the handle while I was shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I&#x27;ve completely changed my whole shaving routine and this brush is just amazing. I can&#x27;t believe I went this long without using a lather brush.</li>
    <li> Great beginner brush. Very soft but it has backbone to it. Very important is to give it some prep and time to break in. There is some bristle loss in the beginning. That&#x27;s perfectly normal. The bristle loss diminishes after each use. It&#x27;s attractive on the stand. Nice woodgraining on it. Nice weight too. I wish it would come with a brush holder but for the great intro price I can forgive them.</li>
    <li> Much nicer feeling than the boar hair one I was using but there&#x27;s not much hair in it.  It needs to be more densely packed in there.  I guess that&#x27;s why the expensive ones are expensive?  Also I am still losing a hair or two each time after what has to be at least two months of shaving with it.</li>
    <li> I use it every day, except weekends, good quality, fairly good price. Bristles are firm which i like, overall good product</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a 5 star brush.  It hasn&#x27;t had any issues shedding.  Provides a very comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I lost a couple to be expected bristles in the beginning. It has held up well. It works awesome! I love using this!</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a surprise gift for my husband and he loved it! We were recommended this particular brush by a friend who has used it for years!</li>
    <li> It does its job, but it does shed its hair a bit if your not applying light pressure. It feels nice during application.</li>
    <li> Certainly surpasses other brushes of similar price point. A few initial uses allowed the few loose bristles to work their way out, but that after that, they all seem fine. The handle is also of better quality than the last few brushes I&#x27;ve owned. All in all, I&#x27;m likely to purchase Tweezerman brushes from here on out. Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I decided to try wet shaving and bought a cheap shaving set from WalMart.  I couldn&#x27;t get a good lather no matter how hard I tried.  I bought this Tweezerman Brush and whipped up a perfect lather in just a few seconds.  The right brush really does make a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I am new to using lather and shave brushes but I am pretty satisfied with this one so far. I have used it about 5 times now and have noticed some of the hairs come off while mixing the lather. I may not be doing it all right as I am still pretty new to this method of shaving.</li>
    <li> I used this product to shave my head for over a year now.  I&#x27;ll agree with most the reviews here that it sheds a bit in the beginning.  Mine must have been special since it shed for over 6 months and had suddenly stopped.  I have it 4 stars vs 5 stars because of the prolonged shedding.  I was just about ready to throw it in the trash when it decided to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my only shave brush so I can&#x27;t give you a comparison.  What I will say is that I don&#x27;t like applying shaving cream or any shave lubricator without a brush now.  Feels too messy now that I&#x27;ve been using a brush for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using shave soap but have since switched to shampoo with my shave brush and I have literally shaved off 15 minutes of my groom time.  Here are a list of my pros and cons of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great applicator&lt;br /&gt;Keeps hands clean(er)&lt;br /&gt;Ornamental addition to your shave collection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Shedding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Shampoo technique--same as using shaving soap.  I place a small amount in my shaving bowl, foam and apply.  For shaving my head, I leave the bowl not too thick of foam and do the most of the foaming part on my head which keeps the foam wet longer and also exfoliates.  Foaming with shampoo also has the hairs all sink to the bottom so I can rinse my hands or razor without parting the sea of floating gunk.  Furthermore, my razor doesn&#x27;t clog up as much and rinses out with only 2-3 swishes--no tap required.  Shave soap required 4-5x more plus tapping on sink.</li>
    <li> all good, there is more in the mail from you. our relationship will continue, but I will not provide surveys</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that this is my first and only shaving brush and I do not profess to be a shaving guru.  I am just a regular guy who is forced to shave almost every day.  Using a brush helps to get the most out of your shaving cream or soap lather-wise, and it feels pretty darn nice as you use it on your face, too.  The bristles are softer than I figured them to be and you can really notice the difference in how comfortable your shave is when you use a brush.  I cleaned the brush prior to my first use and the musky smell was gone after a week or so.  Yes, I lost a few bristles during my first few shaves and catch a straggler badger hair in my bowl from time to time but that is no big deal.  The brush seems durable and I store it bristles down in my shave bowl as many reviewers have suggested.  For the price this is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this brush.  It has a lot going for it.  It is cheap and widely available.  It looks nice enough on the counter.  Unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would like.  First, it sheds hairs constantly.  Each time I use it to lather a soap or cream I would guess it loses five or six hairs.  This is expected when you first use a new brush but it should quit shedding in the first week or two.  Second, the brush is VERY scratchy.  It feels like taking a brillo pad to your face if you use it to face lather.  That isn&#x27;t really a problem if you lather in a bowl or mug though.  Finally, I realized that the price is not actually that great considering that there are MUCH better brushes available at a very similar price.</li>
    <li> I am still getting used to using a brush but so far I have been happy with the brush.  I did not want to spend a lot of money so after reading other reviews stating that with proper care I would not have issues I went with this brush.  It  took 4 or 5 times before the hairs stopped falling out.  Now I have no issues with loosing hairs from the brush.  I have followed the care instructions that other have posted.  Keeping it clean and hanging the brush bristles face down.</li>
    <li> Solid little performer.  I&#x27;ve used it for the past few months with little in the way of bristle loss.  I changed my grip recently so that I hold the bristle base with my fingers while I make the lather - this brush may last forever!</li>
    <li> Great little shaving brush for the price. For a great quality badger shaving brush you want one with many, many more hairs. I used this for travel and found it quite adequate for quick, badger &#x27;n blade shaving.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product, but over 2 months after having this item I am still losing bristles. I just started wet shaving and bought this as a price point item. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a brush if you want a quality product. \&lt;br /&gt;I have my eyes set on a Wet Shaving Product brush to replace this with. I will keep this around for traveling and a backup.</li>
    <li> Second brush I have used in 12 years, first one was the Omega brand and then this one. I brought this up, because I feel that the Tweezerman is better, the bristles feel better against the face and it makes a much better foam.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave much but more of bought this to stimulate my hair before shaving and I thoroughly enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Wow. I bought this shave brush and have enjoyed. The thing is, about a year ago it was $10. NOW it is $17!! Have you noticed that when people give good reviews to products on Amazon the price skyrockets? This was a good deal at $10 but now that it is $17 I would recommend the Van der Hagen which is about $20 for 3 of them and they work great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain about this shaving brush.  It&#x27;s badger hair, about medium stiffness, appears well made, and doesn&#x27;t seem to lose but a few bristles every now and then. We&#x27;ll see after a few months of use.  I did purchase another one for the shaving kit also.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great badger brush.  I have used this for two weeks and it is getting better everyday.  It lathers shave cream fine, is easy to rinse and dries quickly.  It smelled awful for the first week and a half.  It stunk me out of the bathroom.  The smell is has almost completely gone away now.  This had about every ten hair that was very stiff and bristly.  I had to sweep my face and could not dab or brush it.  The brush is getting softer with use.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for the price for cheap is it performing better than expected</li>
    <li> I STILL use this brush after 3 years of use! works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be better than the Elcheapo Walmart boar bristle, that came with a cup and soap, that I had been using. This badger bristle smelled like the badger&#x27;s butt and it was dirty.  Brown water ran out of this thing the first couple of times I tried to rinse it out before using. Not the experience I had hoped for. I can&#x27;t recommend this brush and I have started using the Walmart boar bristle brush again.</li>
    <li> The bristles are quite nice, soft yet firm.  This is exactly what I was hoping it to be and I would buy another.</li>
    <li> My biggest &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; with this product is the smell! It has a &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; smell that will not wash away and actually stays on your face, even after shaving!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s badger hair! Most genuine badger hair brushes start at twice this price and go up from there.&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and a half and it&#x27;s still going strong--still thick, full, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;3) Makes a great lather--beats the old boar-hair brush I used to have hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) At this price, none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so it&#x27;s not silvertip, the handle is basic boring wood, and the badger hair is the cheapest you can find. Still though, I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat if I needed another, but my first one is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: some people have trouble with the bristles falling out. First, it&#x27;s natural for any badger hair brush to shed a little here and there--especially for the first couple of months. If you&#x27;re losing lots of bristles and the brush is becoming noticeably thinner it&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;re storing it wrong. EVERY badger hair brush must be carefully rinsed and shaken out after use, and hung to dry with the bristles facing DOWN. This means you need a stand for it. Buy one or make one. It doesn&#x27;t have to be fancy. I used some old wire to form a little stand. If you store a genuine hair brush by setting it on the counter with the bristles up, you allow all the moisture to settle into the epoxy plug that holds the bristles to the handle. Over time this will destroy the epoxy, and the bristles will fall out. Also if you live in a humid place storing it improperly will allow mold to grow in the bristles since they can&#x27;t dry out correctly. That&#x27;s gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great little brush if it&#x27;s treated right, and I expect to get several more years of use out of it. For the price it&#x27;s at, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I have owned far more expensive brushes.  Some were better and some not so.  Tweezerman is unbeatable for the price and as good as many much more expensive brushes.  I bought this one for my son who is just starting to shave properly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for around 6 months now and I am pleased with it.  Its priced low for a quality badger brush.  It has the funky smell when you get it (they all do) and it eventually goes away.  The only complaint I have is that it sheds at least a couple hairs each time I use it...I dont know if its normal or not, and i do store it bristles down.  Great product for price.</li>
    <li> i tried the tweezerman brush and have to say its ok, not bad. my main comment is if you like a substantial brush with a dense full knot to really work lather/exfoliate you might not be happy. i&#x27;ve used it for around a month now and have to say for the price i wouldn&#x27;t return it after using, but its a bit petite for me. i&#x27;ll use it for a travel brush. construction seems fine</li>
    <li> After all the 609 customer reviews, I doubt if anyone is going to pay any attention to this one.  However,  I can truly say that,  I purchased a&lt;br /&gt;brush that costs around 45 dollars, by the time that I received it.  This brush Tweezerman,  I can tell do difference.  The high price brush,  is&lt;br /&gt;smaller and has a ivory colored plastic handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush Tweezerman,  does have a solid wood handle.  I had rather have two of these,  for one of the high priced one.  This new brush holds lather&lt;br /&gt;very well and is completly soft.  It appears to be very well constructed, and made of the highest quality of materials.  I believe that this brush is&lt;br /&gt;three times the quality and feels better on your face than,  the high priced NAME BRAND,  which costs a third of the other.  This brush presents&lt;br /&gt;its self alot more pleasurable to use than the other.  This a very reasonable price,  for this high quality shaving brush that it is............</li>
    <li> Finally got around to purchasing a soap setup, and it really is nice. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this with, but it seems to whip up a nice lather in the soap, and carries it directly to my face just like it ought to. Excellent bargain.</li>
    <li> These are surprisingly good for the money. Most brushes in this price range are real junk, but these are soft and hold up well. Would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Bristles fell out easily, the entire top came unglued from wooden base.  Better off just going to a chain store.</li>
    <li> Does the job well.  I have been using it for a few months now, and so far it is durable and has a good feel when I am lathering up.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> The brush is pretty good for beginners. There is little hair fall on every use, but I don&#x27;t mind it too much. Makes good lather.</li>
    <li> This was an christmas gift for my Dad, he has just been using a cheap brush for as long as I can remember, this one feels much better and gives a great lather according to him. Im gonna grab me one too, soon.</li>
    <li> Had a very feral smell when I got it, but it wore off after a few uses. Apparently badgers don&#x27;t smell very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sheds a bit, but if you take proper care of it, it can last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Nice little badger shave brush, does the job. Light shedding. Too bad it smells like a wet badger- (hoping that aroma eventually goes away)&lt;br /&gt;If this is what a wet badger really smells like, I can personally guarantee that there are no wet badgers within a 100-mile radius of my home. I&#x27;d smell &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to go with another gift for my Step Father for Christmas.  A natural soap product.  He likes it.</li>
    <li> Using W.P.&#x27;s advice, this brush has held up extremely well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not to be a five star bubble burster, but it costs $11, there&#x27;s a reason for that.  It is inexpensive, a good thing, but I&#x27;ve had nowhere near the results of other lower mid level brushes ($35 and below).  During the breakin, I thought I was brushing with the butt end of my dog, hairs everywhere.  That subsided a bit, but in side by sides with my other brush, very different.  Still learning here, but brushes do make a difference, and you don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune to find one.  Just didn&#x27;t quite see this as the $11 treasure that some others have.</li>
    <li> Pros:  -It&#x27;s inexpensive.  -It works well.    Cons:  -It&#x27;s cheap.  -It never stops shedding hairs.  -The knot fell out. Super glue has held it in place since.  -The clear coat is peeling, and now the handle looks awful.</li>
    <li> I wish the bristles were a little stiffer.  Also they come out often while lathering and you have to pick them off your face before you shave.</li>
    <li> The brush works ok. It creates lather fairly quickly, better than my boar brush. But it has a strong odor which has been lingering around for three days now. Any ideas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, lots of bristles came out during the initial use, but now it seems ok. And yes, I hold it by the base of the bristles rather than the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the smell....like a hot glue mixed with wood sealant.</li>
    <li> It is a bit stiffer than my old one which is not surprizing as that is more than forty years old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past month. It doesn&#x27;t lose it bristles, stays stiff, and cleans easy. Not to mention a great price.</li>
    <li> Get a nicer brush, or go with a boar for the price.</li>
    <li> I am unhappy with this purchase. The constant shedding is my problem with it. Even after conditioning, the shedding is awful. It does however lather decently and it&#x27;s quite soft. I do enjoy that part. I just think I am going to look into a higher quality badger brush. I&#x27;ve used nothing but synthetics or boar until this one, so I did go with a cheaper one to see if I would like it.</li>
    <li> Great product for an average brush price. I use it daily and would buy another.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft and lathers better then my old one. I highly recommend this brush. My shave was even closer then before with my safety razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old and was introduced to using mug soap and a brush just one year ago.  I began with a cheap drugstore brush that lost lots of bristles right away.  It is now down to about 1/3 of it&#x27;s bristles.  The Tweezerman brush has been performing really well.  It is thick, loses very few bristles, most days none at all.  I did fashion a simple stand for the brush, using a coat hanger and two pairs of pliers - works ok but doesn&#x27;t look great.  That would be the only improvement I&#x27;d suggest -  Tweezerman could improve the customer experience by including a simple metal or plastic stand to enable the brush to be stored with the bristles hanging down.  A great value for a really great shave.  PS: I got the best advice on how to shave at a session sponsored by the new Microsoft Store and presented by The Art of Shaving Store, both  at the Mall of America.  Thanks to Leif at Microsoft and to Danielle at The Art of Shaving!  Proves an old dog CAN be taught new tricks!  Arnie</li>
    <li> I read the reviews. They said this was an excellent brush. They said it wouldn&#x27;t shed for at least 6 weeks. That would be long enough for me to decide if this type of shaving was for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I either have a defective product or they&#x27;re all lying. I&#x27;ll go with defective, unusual, perhaps. I&#x27;m shaving more hair from this brush than on my body. It literally will not stop shedding on me. I&#x27;m submitting it for a refund or at least a replacement. And buyer beware. I&#x27;ve dropped probably $200 on Tweezerman tweezers and products over the years, NEVER ever have I been disappointed.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too short and a little too soft to work up a lather. I have two others I prefer.</li>
    <li> Still going strong a year later with bi-weekly shaving. I love this brush! It does lose hairs every once in a while, but not a ton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently store it face down on a stand when not in use.</li>
    <li> Before I get told I get what I pay for, I fully realize this is one of the cheapest badger hair brushes. I was very excited to upgrade from a really cheap boar hair brush, but as the title suggests I am very disappointed in what I got. First the brush smelled like road kill when i first got it. Like it was just plucked fresh from a badger a few hours before i used and and not washed. Washed it with soap many times and my face still smells. Second i had to wash it also because it dripped this weird brown color when I first got it wet, gross. Then when using it, I swear it felt as thought there were pieces of straw in the brush scratching my face. My boar&#x27;s hair brush that cost me $3 is softer than this. Lastly when i hung it up to dry, i found what looked like a dead louse or tick on one of the many hairs that were coming out. I figured it would \\&quot;shed\\&quot; quite a bit the first use but what ever what attached to the hair was not meant to be there. Really excited for this product but very disappointed. I would look for another of the suppliers of these lower cost brushes or just buy another. I will probably go back to my cheap boar (natural hair on the box fyi) brush than use this again.</li>
    <li> This thing has a funky smell to it, I used it once and then tossed it in the trash.  I felt like I just wiped a wet dog across my face.  Even after I rinsed my face I could smell this all day and I think into the next day.  I hate to give bad rating because it seemed to be good quality when it came to construction and materials but it stinks bad, maybe I got a bad one but it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush to start out with, or as a travel brush, as it has a reasonable cost. Mine shed for the first few shaves then stopped. I&#x27;ve purchased another brush and moved this to my travel brush.</li>
    <li> I know that this is on the lower end of the badger-hair brushes and that some of the other reviews of the brush have been great, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all. The brush shed at least 20 hairs, if not more, the first time I used it. Since then the amount has gone down with each shaving, but it is at about 2-3 per shaving. It&#x27;s like a cheap paintbrush that is constantly losing its bristles, which end up on the soap cake or plastered to the side of my face. It&#x27;s possible I just received the one bad brush out of the batch, but I will be looking for a better brush very soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll agree with other reviews that said this brush sheds a bit. But it seemed worst to me the first shave, after a while it died down. Seems like a fine starter brush, I have no standard for comparison - but it&#x27;s working fine for me with Colonel Conk&#x27;s shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the cheapest you&#x27;re gonna find a badger hair brush.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tweezerman products for a very long time.  For the price, this brush is very nice quality.  I have been using it for sometime now and have seen no evidence of bristle loss.  I expect that this like other Tweezerman products will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving since 2009 and I&#x27;ve always wanted a badger brush (only used a Vander Hagen boar) but they are really expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this one for about $12 and it&#x27;s been pretty nice so far. No complaints. Good brush.</li>
    <li> This brush works very well for both creams, and soaps. I&#x27;ve had mine well over a year now, and can count the number of lost bristles on one hand. Fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are you waiting for? Just buy it already!</li>
    <li> I am comparing this to LeisureGuy&#x27;s recommended Eco tools kabuki brush. I like the feel of the badger hair on my face more than the synthetic bristles the Eco tools brush has. However, the Eco tools brush builds lather like no other I have tried. Overall, this brush feels great on my face but the lathering ability isn&#x27;t too impressive.</li>
    <li> On first use, brush hairs fell out all over the place, all over the soap, all over my face, all over the razor. Completely unacceptable, there is no way this should happen with normal treatment on first use. No matter how gently you treat it, this brush sheds like crazy. A complete waste of $15. I am hoping that further use will \\&quot;break it in\\&quot;, but I seriously doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 10 months I am still using this brush, so maybe it was worth the 15 bucks. Hairs still fall out of it, but I did use hair conditioner on it two or three times to try to soften it up. Needs to be treated gently but workable if you don&#x27;t mind the occasional hair stuck to your soapy face.</li>
    <li> I usually go to the local Barbershop for a cut, shave, and shine every week.  Now that I have a newborn I was really looking for a product that I could get those same results but in my own bathroom.  I found this product to be the answer to my prayers.  Easy to use, a breeze to clean and leaves a smooth lather across my face.  My barber doesn&#x27;t like that I am not coming in frequently but my budget loves it.</li>
    <li> 100% Badger hair - excellent value. Lathers and applies the soap nicely. The brush cleans up well and we have not had excessive bristle loss. Would order again.</li>
    <li> This is a soft brush, especially compared to boar bristle brushes. There were a lot of loose bristles for my first and second use of this brush, which was to be expected, but now there are at least 2 or 3 loose bristles with every use. They hardly ever interfere with the shave, however, so it&#x27;s worth the money for what&#x27;s out there.</li>
    <li> This brush was sent on time as of the quality i only paid $12 for this i guess u get what u pay for. The hairs are falling out quit quicky even on the first use. I have not had another badger brush to compare to so I cant say if it was how it was made or just the brand. All in all it does its job.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent brush considering the price. I&#x27;ve lost some bristles over time but I was expecting that.</li>
    <li> great  brush have two.</li>
    <li> Bristles are sharp and constantly fall out. I used once and immediately upon using the brush I hated it. It makes sense that you get what you pay for. Some products it just pays to get the real thing.</li>
    <li> Bristles are hard, clump together and smell. I ended up spending ~$20 more on la-occitanes brush, which is soft, no smell and seems well made.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brush, it feels very sturdy and feels like its made from great material. I&#x27;m able to lather my face very well and it fits perfect with Colonel Conk #7 stand too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years.  Great brush! Holds up forever without losing many bristles. I would definitely suggest one.</li>
    <li> Works well at building a lather.  The quality of the badger hair and the assembly is questionable.  After giving it a very thorough first time rinse and wring, I still had hairs coming off on my face while lathering up!  A week later it&#x27;s still happening.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I have used this for more than two years without issue. You need to be careful and after every use, wash it, eliminate all water pressing with two fingers and put it in a stand with the handle on top. If you put it to dry standing in the handle, it will start loosing the hairs.</li>
    <li> Works for me, no issues here</li>
    <li> Sorta stinky at first, but dish soap helps that. Little bit prickly overall. Definitely shedding more than any brush I&#x27;ve owned. That being said, it&#x27;s a solid starter badger, and I&#x27;m going to get my use out of it. My boars were a bit to large and stiff to agree with an Arko face lather, and this brush does that job quite well.    UPDATE: I was impatient with my boar brushes. They&#x27;ve broken in and are way better for face lathering now. So where does that leave the Tweezerman? Well, it&#x27;s just a small, floppy, prickly brush that I hardly ever use, and it wasn&#x27;t much cheaper than any of my boar brushes. Best case scenario: it ends up in my travel kit. The best bang for your buck in shave brushes lies in boar brushes, probably Omega and Semogue. If you specifically desire a badger hair brush and want a great value, look up a company called Whipped Dog.</li>
    <li> The wood handle fell apart after a couple years. I&#x27;m trying a plastic one that shouldn&#x27;t deteriorate as easily this time around.</li>
    <li> Excellent product works great.</li>
    <li> great brush .nice quality bristles.beats the heck out of having to pony up 5 times the cost to just shave.i wish the base was a little heaver.</li>
    <li> This is the first badger I have owned but I am very happy with the quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Just started shaving with a DE and this is my first brush. So far, I&#x27;m really happy with the brush and with DE shaving overall. I knew from research that all shave brushes shed to some extent. So when I first got it I practiced making lather a few times and made sure to look for and pull any loose hairs when I cleaned it and then I do the same after each shave. If I&#x27;ve lathered and cleaned the brush maybe a dozen time, I&#x27;ve never had more than few hairs come out each time and I&#x27;ve never had any hair in my lather or on my face. I didn&#x27;t notice much of any smell when it was new, but after a few uses it only smells like whatever shaving creme soap I used last. I do find it to be just a little rough feeling on my face when lathering, but that may just be because it&#x27;s new and needs to be broken in or because it&#x27;s inexpensive with lower grade badger hair. I would definitely recommend it to anyone as a great, affordable starter badger brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush and enjoyed it for about 6-8 months.&lt;br /&gt;I hang it brush side down,....always!&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday while rinsing &amp; drying it, I tapped it on the edge of the sink,&lt;br /&gt;and the brush knot feel out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried rubber cement. NOT.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone know what type of glue to use to re-glue the bristles to the handle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that small/lrg/ problem, I really like this little brush.</li>
    <li> I have used this brush twice now and I am impressed overall.  The badger hair is very nice and the brush is well formed and dense.  The wooden handle is a little on the small size but not so much so. The wood is heavily lacquered (or covered in polyurethane), which seals it from water but I would think long term this finish may eventually succumb to water damage (if the wood cracks).  I think however this would take a long time, especially since I always dry the handle after I am done rinsing it.  I have been using a boars hair brush and I find that the badger hair takes a slightly different approach in terms of lather build up and application to the face but neither is bad or better. Many people seem to complain about the coarseness of boars hair but I found this badger hair to feel almost the same as my boars hair brush which has been in use for many years and is now rather soft. I would like to mention that the first time I used this badger hair brush it shed a lot of hair but by the second time it did not lose any so it seems to be fine now. Overall I think this is an excellent brush for the price and a great value. I could not see the need to spend $60-$80 or more for a premium brush when this one works so well.</li>
    <li> Is fun to use, and works well. I am starting to make my own soap, and that includes shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Bristle base with bristles came out of the handle within weeks. Have not yet been able to glue it back in. Return it? Why wouldn&#x27;t the same breakage happen with another?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush about once or twice a week for about two years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are having issues with your brushes loosing a lot of hairs, one or two here and there is to be expected. You really shouldn&#x27;t be touching the bristles except for the very base to close the bulb a little bit as your whip up your lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are stiff enough to make a good lather, but soft enough to feel quite nice against the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure you let this guy dry with the bristles hanging down, otherwise the water gets into the base and starts to crack the wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take good care of it, it will reward  you with close shaves for a long time.</li>
    <li> This brush is very nice for the price.  Some hairs fall out of the brush the first time it is used, but they fall out less and less the more it is used.  This brush has done a great job at solving my problem with razor burn.  It really makes the hairs raise to the surface for a clean shave.  The brush dose have kind of a weird odor about it, but I am guessing it will fade with use.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical and the item did smelled a bit in the beginning but with constant and regular use, smell is gone and the performance has improved, just follow the maintenance tips and care well, it will be nice to yr skin in return :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving. I asked my wife if she could get me this as an upgrade to my existing long hair boar brush thinking that this would be softer and more absorbent. This brush the bristles are cut into a pleasing round shape but what that does is make them really prickly. I feel like this thing is stabbing the heck out of my face when I use it. I tried my boar brush and its soft and makes a nice rich lather just like this one without the skin irritation. I&#x27;m kind of bummed because I thought that this would improve my shaving experience but it just makes my skin feel irritated. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This brush is a good brush except that it tends to lose the beaver hair. I don&#x27;t know if it normally the case that it should lose its hair, or if I got a defective brush.</li>
    <li> The brush lost quite a few hairs every shave using it daily for 2 weeks. Brush was also very scratchy. Have since bought a different brush.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad shaving brush, and it makes me wonder why other brush manufacturers charge 4x as much for their products. It is made with real badger hair, which is a plus, but the hair isn&#x27;t as dense or as fine as the other brushes I&#x27;ve seen and used. It&#x27;s durable, too. I&#x27;ve been using one as my travel brush for nine years now, and it&#x27;s still going strong. The wooden handle has not cracked or split. When put to use with a good-quality soap it produces a thick, rich lather that my straight razor seems to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a good starter or travel brush, or a regular brush for a shaver on  a budget.</li>
    <li> great brush for beginners or expert shavers alike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;people complain about the stink of some brushes at first but i had no issues with that</li>
    <li> This brush is probably not the best one out there.  But, for the price you cannot go wrong.  Once, I master the art of brush shaving I will probably jump to a higher quality brush.  But, for now; this gets the job done.</li>
    <li> For the price I&#x27;m super impressed. I&#x27;m still using this after more than 3 years. Yes, it has lost some bristles, but there are plenty left to build a great lather. I will probably upgrade to a nicer one some day, but for now this works great!</li>
    <li> The bristles are excellent. Dries up quickly as well (if you hang it upside down). Highly recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> What a worthless piece of garbage. In the first two days, the varnish was peeling. After a month, the silver housing that the bristles reside in has disconnected from the handle. Very weak glue used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the lather is produces is suspect. Go with the Col Conk heavy chrome one.</li>
    <li> This Tweezerman shaving brush is inexpensive and has lost few if any bristles during the months I&#x27;ve used it. If something goes bad about it I&#x27;ll buy another one just like it. I&#x27;ve had several other Tweezerman products and they make nice stuff. I&#x27;d suggest drying this on one of those little chrome stands (handle up) to keep water from the bristles from seeping into the handle/knot and causing bristles to eventually fall out. Great little brush.</li>
    <li> I recommend this cheap brush as a starter shaving brush. After using this for about a year the wood started cracking but other than that it was a good brush.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3MW7V6L04O7JU]]You get what you pay for. Brush was fine until the fur totally separated from the handle. Only owned the brush for a few months. Time to upgrade. (As a side note, it wasn&#x27;t as soft as better quality brushes I&#x27;ve seen.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going old school and using an old fashioned Merkur Model 180 safety razor so this has become a necessity. Good quality. I like how it stands on its end while drying. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and it does shed a bristle sometimes, but not a big aggravation which is the only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going old school, give this a shot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to a bigger brush. This brush is nice and soft, and lathers well but do to its small size I had trouble using my shave mug to get a good lather. I think this brush would be best used to build the lather in your hand (not my favorite way).</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my husband for Christmas.  He has been using brushes for years.  The first time or two that he used it, some of the bristles came out.  We thought we&#x27;d bought a bad brush.  After that, the bristles stopped falling out.  He now loves the brush and wanted me to write this review to let other potential buyers know.  When it&#x27;s time to replace this one, we&#x27;ll buy another one just like it.</li>
    <li> If your starting out wet shaving this is the brush for you! Don&#x27;t waste money on expensive brushes this one does everything you need a shaving brush to do. You will lose some bristles the first week, but thats common with these types of brushes, my 40 dollar brush did the same thing. Enjoy it you own it to yourself.</li>
    <li> Whatever, it&#x27;s a brush. So many raves about Badger brushes....I can&#x27;t tell much difference from the Boar bristle I was using before. Too early to tell how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Nice product I have plans to buy more!!!!!!!!Good feel also easy to work with what else can I say WOW</li>
    <li> This brush is terrible! first use I had hair all over the soap, my face, the razor and the sink! I would not recommend this to any one!</li>
    <li> Well, my Tweezerman brush busted after 11 months... the brush/bristles separated from the handle. It was never dropped, and always hung with the bristles down to dry. When it was in working order, I loved it. I used it to make lather with the C.O. Bigelow cream in a ceramic cappuccino mug. It was great. It was my first brush (I also bought my first DE razor with this brush), so I have nothing to compare it to, but when I used it, it was wonderful.It held water (and heat) and lather really well. Good stiffness, and minimal shedding (shedding stopped after first five-ish shaves). So, overall, I am pleased with this brush&#x27;s performance, but not pleased with its longevity and lifespan. Though, I suppose you get what you pay for. I would order it again, but I figured, why keep spending the $20 when I could buy a $40 badger brush which will hopefully last much longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this shave brush as a gift for my dad along with his razor. He said he liked the brush and it works well.</li>
    <li> This brush is great:  it&#x27;s comfortable, creates an excellent lather, and cleans up nicely.  The only problem, however, was for the first few uses it had a putrid odor about it.  While I wrote this off to the fact that it was a badger hair brush and this was just an odor from the hairs, it eventually went away and is now odor free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly a year, it still looks and works great.  Despite the smell, I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent. I waited to review this brush because I wanted to see how quickly it lost bristles. I am very happy with thisa high quality product. Good shave.</li>
    <li> It certainly does it&#x27;s job in that you will have a face covered in Shave soap, however you may have a few bristles from the brush on you as well.&lt;br /&gt;The wooden handle is good and sturdy but the hairs just won&#x27;t seem to stay in place, I get about 4 or 5 of them stuck to my cheeks every time I shave.</li>
    <li> My husband shaves the old fashioned way and he says it is &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; Lathers well and rinses clean very easily.</li>
    <li> It works very well with shaving soaps and creams.</li>
    <li> This brush is still holding up. I followed the cleaning advice of soaking it under running water, and squeezing out the shave soap a couple of times, then holding it by the base of the bristles and flicking the water out. I bent a wire hanger to serve as a holder to hold the bristles upside down so it dries properly too.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are soft and it works great. Love this brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a college student that wanted to try a shaving brush and this one works well, just make sure you let it dry facing down hung somewhere.  I shave once a week or even once every two weeks, I bought it I would say 3 or 4 months ago and I still have it.  Some of the little brushes are already coming down but what do you expect for the price you pay for?</li>
    <li> Love this and a great gift for my son who was looking for a retro feel.  He loves it and uses it every time he shaves.</li>
    <li> I like a brush to put on lather with when I shave. The bristles are soft and supple, not like the cheap ones you get in the drug stores where I live. It is also the perfect size for a gym bag or travel kit.</li>
    <li> I have just turned to the &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; shaving tools, and let me say that this &amp;#34;Tool&amp;#34; does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It makes a great, thick, cream.  It dries out nicely, and looks great to boot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and it works great so far.  I&#x27;ve had a few bristles lost but well within acceptable limits.  It lathers well and is as advertised.</li>
    <li> Even if soaked for an hour it is still rough and uncomfortable. Yeah, it costs $10, but for $25 you can get a real brush..</li>
    <li> This brush is thick and the bristles feel great!  It sheds a bit at first, but that stops after a short period of time.  All that and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> Works well for the price.</li>
    <li> Holds water very well.  I&#x27;m able to build up a nice lather.  Rinses cleanly and easily.  The only reason I&#x27;ve knocked it down a star is because I still find a hair or two in my soap mug every 3rd or 4th use.  Nothing terrible but a little annoying.  This is after a couple months use.  When new, it had a slight animal smell, but then it is badger hair.  Overall, very nice product for a fraction of what some of them run.</li>
    <li> Pretty much like I thought it would be from the picture!</li>
    <li> good brush for a good price!!!!</li>
    <li> Great value! It&#x27;s better now, two years and a half years after I purchased it. The few random loose hairs fell out within a week. The badger smell is gone within a month or so, depending upon the shaving soap/cream you use. Use it, shake the water out, and dry it hanging bristles down on a stand, and you&#x27;ll satisfied with the performance and value of this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as a replacement for one I lost. I was a little unsure about using this small brush because I normally use the larger ones. However, this brush has held up over the last 2 months and is exactly what I needed. It produces a rich lather and is a joy to use.</li>
    <li> I got this over a year ago and I think it is a super product at a super price. Other reviews give great advice on the care and use. I lay mine down after use and have not lost any bristles at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t look anywhere else, just buy it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for the past two years. In the entire time I&#x27;ve been using this brush, I&#x27;ve lost maybe 15-30 bristles, but in all honesty I&#x27;d have been surprised if I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite simply, this brush beats every other brush on the market in price, and it still performs the basic functions of a brush without fail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, this little guy won&#x27;t be winning any awards for quality, but if you are looking for a starter brush for wet-shaving (as I was two years ago), this is the ONLY brush I&#x27;d suggest. No beginner shaver has the know-how to choose the right brush for them, nor should they invest the 50-400 dollars for the higher end brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side-note: I don&#x27;t treat this brush well. I dry it while it&#x27;s standing on it&#x27;s wooden handle, and I don&#x27;t pay it even the slightest bit of care, yet it hasn&#x27;t given up on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong with this brush unless you are looking for a specific feature only available in higher-end brushes like higher hair-count, thicker bristles, different materials, or size. Would highly reccomend, and will likely purchase this exact brush when my original one eventually dies.</li>
    <li> Upon first use the brush hairs pulled out and got stuck in my shaving cream. I had to pick them out as I was shaving. Kind of annoying if you ask me. Maybe spend a little more money and not have this problem.</li>
    <li> Pretty awesome.  Looks classy, does the job.  Stopped shedding after a little break-in period, but it was never a big deal.  As others have stated, make sure you shake the water out each time (if you store it facing up), and if you &#x27;wring&#x27; it dry, or pull it through a hand-towel, you&#x27;re obviously not going to want to pull the bristles.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because of the price. I was hoping for something that would last me a year or so as this was my first foray into the old-school shaving techniques. I have to say, everything about shaving with a safety razor and shave soap is so much better, except for this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem started on day 1, when I lathered up individual hairs from the brush were on my soap and ended up on my face. I believed this to be a &amp;#34;breaking in&amp;#34; period. Sadly, either this brush still needs to be broken in more (after 6 months) or this is a defective braid of the bristles. I read some other comments and this seems to be a common issue. I&#x27;m now looking for a new brush, hopefully one with a little more attention to QC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Wood handle&lt;br /&gt;Real Badger Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Constant shedding on hair</li>
    <li> Had to pick out a good number of bristles and bits out of my soap the first few uses, but after a few shaves it stopped shedding and performed perfectly.</li>
    <li> This product broke within the first week of using it.  The hair came apart and fell out of the holder.</li>
    <li> The only shaving brush you will ever need.  I bought a cheap brush from the drugstore and it lasted a few years, but it is nowhere near as good as this one.  Also the lather created by pure badger hair can&#x27;t be beat.  Even if you don&#x27;t get tis brush, make sure you get one with badger hair.  The difference is substantial.  I have my brush at least 5 years and it is as good as he day I got it.  Make sure you get a stand for it.  It will help keep it sanitary and dry and also preserve the brush.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  I like it.  It gets the job done.  The only problem I have with it is that it sheds a few bristles into my shaving soap every time I use.  Not a big deal.  For all I know, every brush may have the same problem.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brush.  No bristles fall out!  I love the look of it too.  Looks great as a set</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to foam/gel from a can and was new to shaving soaps and brushes. So far it&#x27;s pretty good. Make sure you get a stand with it so it can dry properly. Minimal shedding from the brush and comfortable on the face. For the price ($15) it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> My name is Donovan and I am new to wet shaving although I have been using a cheap walmart synthetic for the past year now with shaving soap and a cartridge razor till I could afford the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always hated shaving, it was a pain, the razor always pulled and tugged and I always bled after. I thought this was how shaving was supposed to be, I jumped from electric to razor to electric and back again, sinking 1000&#x27;s into it and never enjoying it all. I then heard about wet shaving from news I was reading and started to research it. I found some how to vids on youtube and they really showed and explained just how great and painless it is to use this type of razor. I researched the heck out of this new way of shaving and realized two things, 1. this type is way to awesome and takes me back to the way people are meant to shave, and 2. this type is rather expensive but price wont stop me. Now price did stop me for the longest time, no job and all but I still want to do this so i have bought everything i need piece by piece. I also have to say it is really hard to find a badger hair brush that is good quality and yet cheaper and on top of that willing to actually ship to Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(To all Canadian customers like myself, do not order from american wholesale, they will rook you out of your money, they do not provide you with a tracking number and they will not return your emails when the product is late, order from amazon.com and they will treat you right.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto this brush. I ordered this brush because it is 100% badger hair, it is well made and the handle is wood which is really important to me as I appreciate fine crafted wood products. This brush is the pinacle of great craftmenship, oh and dont go by the picture it is actually a darker wood finish with a copper ring which looks real nice for this brush, and tips of the bristles have a silver color to them. The brush is priced the same as a cheap walmart synthetic and this brush isso amazing for shaving. People say that wet shaving with either a DE razor or a straight razor is an art form and they really want to shave again, these people are not crazy, they are completely right and with this brush there is no exception to this, I cant wait till the next time, so that i may use this brush again. Please people buy this brush and take care of it properly, it really will last you a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for care instructions there is a review under the 5 stars that will tell you what you need to do to make sure the brush stays pristine for many many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3RZJAPCUPQJCN]]I like these little brushes. I have been using them for many years and they work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Quality is good. I have never had one fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;♦ Maintains form well. Flattens out a little around 1 year or so.&lt;br /&gt;♦ Fits in stands and soap jars well.&lt;br /&gt;♦ Good price.&lt;br /&gt;♦ Handle holds up well.&lt;br /&gt;♦ Available at many drug stores in case I need a fast replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► These hold up so well, I really have no complaint with them. If properly maintained, they will last a very long time. If you use a stand, they last much longer. I was given a much more expensive brush as a gift but I did not find it to be any better. If I buy online, it has \\&quot;Tweezerman\\&quot; written on the side. If I buy locally, they don&#x27;t have anything written on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► The video is to give you an idea of what it looks like. Click FULL SCREEN to view better.</li>
    <li> The Tweezerman was my first shaving brush.  I was getting started with DE shaving and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money, since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would stick with it.  Initially it shed quite a few hairs (10-20 per use), but after a couple weeks of use and shaking out the loose hairs from manufacturing, the shedding stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this brush was adequate and lathered ok, it felt cheap. The handle feels very light, and the knot is not particularly dense, so it doesn&#x27;t hold as much water.  In the end I ended up buying and Omega Pure Badger brush that is a little larger, and much denser, and lathers much better than the Tweezerman.  Of course it also cost more than twice what I paid for this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I do think the Tweezerman brush has value is as a travel brush. It&#x27;s relatively compact, and it&#x27;s inexpensive enough that loss or damage isn&#x27;t a huge concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Compact&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention inexpensive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Feels cheap&lt;br /&gt;Sparse knot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who I recommend this brush for: Beginners on a budget, travelers looking for a compact inexpensive solution, cheap-skates who can put up with the less than stellar performance.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been hard to find a good shaving brush. This brush is the best one I&#x27;ve seen, and very cheap! thanks</li>
    <li> This brush is serviceable. I can soap it up and get the soap to my face with it. The quills are noticeably sharp which is a problem with less expensive brushes, but they don&#x27;t fall out which is another problem with some less expensive ones. I had left my brush of many years behind at a hotel and was in a hurry to get a replacement -- it&#x27;s the only way I&#x27;ve shaved for many years. Delivery on this one was fast, and I&#x27;m still using it. One can never be sure ordering another more expensive one online that it, too, won&#x27;t have sharp quills *sigh*</li>
    <li> My brush just arrived, it was exactly as represented and the quality is superior to others I looked at that were more expensive.  I recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> Good value for a Badger brush. Work well and spreads lather as good as other brushes costing twice as much.</li>
    <li> Not the best brush on the market. It is prickly and loses bristles fairly quick, but because of the fact that it really is 100% badger hair and because of the price it is a good brush for beginning wetshavers.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this...it saves shaving cream and is also neater. I recommend the young guys to check it out.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush is perhaps the most inexpensive way to get a pure Badger bristle shaving brush. I&#x27;ve now been using it for over four years, and it has not shed any great quantity of its bristles like the cheaper brushes on the market. The brush head remains densely packed and quite soft. Hopefully, it will remain that way for some time to come. In the meantime, I do enjoy the close and comfortable shaves that are aided by this brush. Because of it, I have sworn off of canned shave gels for every situation except travel. They just can&#x27;t compare to your average $1.50 cake of shaving soap and this brush. This was a very worthwhile purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed with this product at first as the hairs were falling off the first few times that I used it. However, after awhile, those initial lose hairs were gone and the product worked flawlessly. I think it is a good brush for the price after you get a few lose hairs out.</li>
    <li> Have owned my original Tweezerman for 5 years.  Love it--great brush.  Owned the second one I bought as a travel brush for 3 weeks before the knot popped out.  Maybe issues with quality control?  But for $10 bucks, it&#x27;s hard to argue.  Lathers well and has a great feel.  Note: If you want a stiffer brush that will exfoliate, but that&#x27;s in the same price range, get the Escali.</li>
    <li> Opened package, horrible odor coming from the brush.  Only got worse when it became wet.  Also, lost bristles immediately.  One side of the brush looked as if some bristles were too short or had been cut too short.  Would not recommend this.  Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> There isnt a whole lot to say.  Its a brush seems sturdy makes shaving fun...good enough to get 5 stars...it is what they said it is...</li>
    <li> This thing really stinks. Not only do the hairs shed like cray cray, but the brush smells like the hair was harvested from the perianal region of the badger. I would have imagined that they would have a process to eliminate or at the very least minimize that smell of a wet dog in heat that just hangs on this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this thing smells like it was being stored in a hobo&#x27;s holey underpants during the summertime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a 300 pound man was using it for years to apply talcum powder to his groin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like wet flatulence in a summertime car with the windows rolled up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, before I forget, the little chrome stand they try to peddle with this brush is too short to hold it off any flat surface. Serious disappointment folks.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks, the handle casing got loose and fell off. I still use it though because the handle is plenty long, it just looks ugly. The bristles are good, but to be fair, it&#x27;s the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever tried. I probably won&#x27;t try this one again, but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
    <li> the only problem I had with this brush was that the badger smell lasted a decent amount of time. 8 or so months later and it&#x27;s just a small hint of the smell. now it smells a ton more like my almond soap than the badger. Just use it and wash it until the smell leaves. Other than that, the brush lathers perfectly and feels great in your hand. There&#x27;s no reason to spend hundreds on your first badger brush. this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This brush is very comfortable and good at creating a nice lather, but every time I used it I got at least two - three hairs on face. This is after months of use, it never stops! It appears to be a hit-or-miss based on other reviews. You may be better off shelling out a bit more and getting a nicer brush.</li>
    <li> I use this brush to apply pre-shave soap - I use my nice (and much more expensive) Parker Safety Razor silvertip badger brush for the lather. The difference is quite noticeable.  This brush is about half the size, the bristles are stiffer, and it doesn&#x27;t hold nearly as much water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not really a fair comparison, considering the Parker brush is about five times as expensive.  This brush works fine, and it is a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, after about a year of use, the logo has worn off of my Parker brush, but the Tweezerman logo is still nice and glossy.</li>
    <li> first couple shaving was just massive amount of fall-out. It has been less and less now but really wished they could have manage the loose end hairs slightly better.</li>
    <li> Much better than the cheap box store brush I was using previously.  There may be better brushes out there, but this one is a good value. It does shed a little.</li>
    <li> Bristles fall out. I followed instructions, Hung upside down, Gentle with the bristles, but they often wind up all over my face. I&#x27;m gonna look for another one.</li>
    <li> The only reason i gave a three star was the fact that this brush sheds quite a bit.  I thought using this product for a month it would have stopped by now.  The shedding has slowed but still a little annoying.</li>
    <li> This was my first shaving brush I ever used.  So I dont know how it is supposed to feel, how you are supposed to lather it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me point out some of the experiences i had:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. it is not as soft as I expected.  I heard not all 100% badger brush are soft?&lt;br /&gt;2. It keeps losing its hair.  For the first few months, I was losing at least couple threads every day.  After about 6 months, it stopped losing hair so now it is fine.</li>
    <li> Good for what it was made for</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for a month now with no issues!  It&#x27;s a great brush, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> What a good brush. Makes plenty of lather and is gentle on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Holds plenty of soap and is easy to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;It works great with my left over shave cream (expensive jells) and my shaving soap the best</li>
    <li> Ive been using this brush for about 6 months and I got what I paid for  - a cheap brush that constantly loses its bristles.  There are still more than enough to work up a good lather, and it really wouldn&#x27;t matter too much EXCEPT...the bristles get caught in my razor and makes for an uncomfortable shave.  Its cheap, so if your just testing to see if you want to go the old school way of shaving this is fine for a test run but in the long run, its a poor choice.&lt;br /&gt;And yes I have stored and cleaned it properly the entire time Ive owned it.  It started losing bristles on day one and has only gotten worse over time. Im online right now to buy a new one....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a year now and it works well. No bristles have fallen out yet.</li>
    <li> This was a good one and is lasting well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush about 6 months ago as my first 100% badger hair brush.  I use it almost everyday and it has lasted well so far and is in great shape.  The bristles are soft enough for your skin but stiff enough to get a good lather. The wood handle is very nice and a good size for my medium sized hand.  I haven&#x27;t had too many bristles fall out and the brush still feels as dense as the first day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every once in a while I end up using my older boar hair brush and it is a huge difference.  The boar hair is so stiff and I always get a few bristles on my face or in the lather.  I would highly recommend this brush to those who would like a nice high quality brush at good price.</li>
    <li> This sucker is going strong 2 years later! No issues with the hairs becoming unglued or anything. I don&#x27;t actually have a stand, so I just lean it on it&#x27;s side to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the best $5-6 I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
    <li> Simple horrible product.&lt;br /&gt; Just a smell can kill you. I can&#x27;t imagine that any reputable manufacture can produce product like this.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush is simply terrible. It has little backbone, its scratchy, it distributes lather poorly. For less money you can get a vastly superior boar brush. Look up nanbantrader on eBay and treat yourself to a Semogue 1305 instead.</li>
    <li> I got this brush because I wanted to try shaving with a brush and soap for the first time. This was an inexpensive brush but was still well recommended by a professional. The badger brush head is good quality and feels nice on the skin. The bristles created a nice lather and this allowed me to get a really nice clean shave. I lost a few bristles the first time I used it, but I figure all the loose ones will have fallen out after a few shaves. I would recommend this brush for novices that want an inexpensive way to get into a new type of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using the brush for only about 2 months now and I have noticed a lot of bristles are falling out. Also the outer edge of bristles is getting bent and mussed up.</li>
    <li> OMG more than 2 years still strong. I  am very happy with this purchase. Love amazon. One of my friend asked today which brush I use and I was looking for my old purchase history and I am very much impressed with amazon that it shows me Purchase date as soon as I open product details. Keep up the good job amazon. Its not amazon review but cant help with their good service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is really good quality and make sure you buy following item for brush holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XURHNY/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> After a solid year of using this brush, I felt obligated to return and offer praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has been great, with minimal care (i.e. shaking out water after use, storing brush side down) it is in nearly the same condition it was when purchased last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Despite the comedic name, this brush performs. I&#x27;ve never used a boutique badger brush so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything like that, but it lathers enough for me!</li>
    <li> This is a good, inexpensive, lathering brush. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and its still going strong. You will always lose a few bristles here and there, but it&#x27;s not at all noticeable. Take care of it and you&#x27;ll be able to use it for a long time. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this same one again. .. If I ever need to, that is.</li>
    <li> Feels like a thousands small needles on my face. Might need more time to break in but some of the other cheap brushes I own work better and feel better.</li>
    <li> Makes great lather, much better than the cheap one that I got from a local store.</li>
    <li> This brush lasted only 6 months before the bristles fell out (the glue came undone) all at once while lathering in my shave bowl).&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the brush rates an &#x27;okay&#x27; but really the bristles are way too stiff for a badger brush - stiffer than my two boar bristle brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Also the smell of the fur was quite strong - overpowering all but the strongest scented shave creams I used (who likes smelling like a dead badger when done).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had it lasted more than 6 months it may have rated a &#x27;3&#x27; based on the price being so low ant it doing a decent job for the price.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> What more can I say about a brush that I thought was inexpensive when purchased - $13.50, was expected to last a year at best, and is still doing yeoman service over four years later?&lt;br /&gt;Its a fine brush for my expectations - work up a nice lather, help spread it around and let me shave. It doesnt have a fancy drip stand, I just lay it down on its side on a small napkin after shaving, taking care to shake out as much water as possible - perhaps 6 to 8 shakes. that is all of the TLC it gets.&lt;br /&gt;I use the shaving cream that comes in tubes, like toothpaste, and ordinary twin-blade disposable Gillette razors from Costco that last me 2-3 weeks each, shaving after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;It lost a few bristles in the first month, but nothing since. It works just like new, perhaps better since the bristles have probably softened with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy another one? Just did! (Gift for Dad)</li>
    <li> Great price and so far great quality. I don&#x27;t like that I have to lay it on its side when drying, but I guess I could buy the piece to hang it up side so the brush doesn&#x27;t start to fray.</li>
    <li> You can smell the animal for a long time. It takes months for it to go away, and then it comes back!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried washing in a lot of soap etc...., no luck. Eventually it becomes quite less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself does what it claims, its firm and you can feel the bristles do the work.</li>
    <li> This pared with the wooden shaving bowl made the perfect gift.  After looking at many more expensive brushes we found this was not only a good buy but  it stood up to what the description said.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 3 star rating because it does lather up very well. What I don.t like is that the badger hairs keep falling out. I often have to pick single hairs off my face while I shave. Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent. I have had many brushes and the ones I used to like the most were boar bristle brushes. Badger brushes were too soft (and too damn expensive) for my taste. When I bought this brush to give it a try, I was more than impressed; it is softer than boar bristles, but it is firm enough to help you create a great lather. I have had mine for two years now without the slightest problem. In fact this is the second I have, since the first got lost after almost two years of faithful service as well. However, you have to get used to shake the brush well after a thorough wash with warm water and hang it bristles down. Really a great product.</li>
    <li> These are so much more expensive in stores - I have had an expensive brush and cannot tell the difference.  This is simply a very good brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush, especially for the money.....I replaced at $5 (not badger) brush with this one and there is no comparison between the two. This one is much softer and holds its liquid a great deal better.....I cannot picture a better shave.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome.  The wooden handle can chip easy so watch out if you drop it.  I have another brush of a different mark and it does not compare to the tweezerman.  Love using it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy tat I ordered the brush and it helps me when I have to shave, not bad for a 92 year old man.</li>
    <li> Typical funky smell at first, but that dissipated with a couple uses.  Works lather well into beard.</li>
    <li> Very excellent product. This brush is just everything it says it is. Works great and feels great on the face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as my first-ever shaving brush based on other positive reviews, and have been very satisfied.  I have had no problems with unpleasant odors or excessive loss of bristles.  I can see where a larger brush could be beneficial, but this is all you really need.  A great value at a great price compared to other badger brushes.</li>
    <li> It is very affordable, but the hairs keep falling out while shaving. It&#x27;s quite annoying and I would not recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> This was a better brush than included i my first shaving kit, but hair kept falling out, and finally the knot popped out of the handle. I glued back the knot with epoxy, but the hair falling out made me wonder how long the brush would really last. I replaced this brush with a shaving brush from Whipped Dog. It&#x27;s a lot more money, but not nearly as dear as the 3-figure brushes that are out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good shaving brush, I&#x27;d recommend the Whipped Dog brushes. If you&#x27;re looking for a top of the line brush with a 3 figure price tag, well, you wouldn&#x27;t be looking at this one, either, would you?</li>
    <li> No problem with this. I read the other reviews and agree with them.  For the price this is as expected.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for nearly two years now, and it has performed within expected parameters.  The bristles are a bit rough and coarse on the skin, but this can be greatly mitigated by angling the brush as you apply lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the month, it would shed a few bristles; this is expected with any badger brush, and not a complaint.  At a price that&#x27;s quite difficult to beat, you get what you pay for- and then some.  This brush is still going strong!  No unpleasant odors, no falling apart, or other issues I&#x27;ve seen reported in these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviews addressed, proper care of this (any, and all) brushes is paramount to the survivability of said brush.  To care for the brush, in a nut shell, you need to shake out as much water as you can when you finish shaving (flicking of the wrist does this nicely), then hang it upside down; with the flat base pointing up.  It may be tempting to let it dry on the base, but this will ruin the brush.  You can either purchase a stand for your brush and/or razor, or build a makeshift one to let it hang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, decent brush at an excellent value.  Rather coarse bristles, but this helps with exfoliating your skin during the shave, and can be &amp;#34;adjusted&amp;#34; by the angle you apply it with.</li>
    <li> I read most of the negative reviews, but had already ordered it as only 2 were left and the price had dropped.....WOW ... I&#x27;m glad I got it. A little scented shave cream/soap took away the mild scent and it has not been shedding. I looked at the dates of the negative reviews and I&#x27;m guessing that there was a bad batch of fur during that time last year. I smelled it out of the box...very mild. I smelled it after wetting...stronger smell like wife&#x27;s hair after playing tennis...Shampooed with Panteen... pretty neutral smell. Used it with Old Spice shave cream, rinsed, dryed....it smells nice. Glad I saved that money so I can take my wife to dinner after my shave.</li>
    <li> Great shaving brush.  Sooooo soft.  Should have bought one of these first time around.</li>
    <li> Having used this brush several times now, I have experienced no lost hairs or other problems some reviewers note.  I wonder if it might be the lessons my Grandfather taught me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He insisted that a brush be soaked, bristles down, in a cup of warm water for a minute or two before lathering.  The water should only cover about half of the length of the bristles.  Natural wicking action of the hairs will take care of the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon removing it from the soak, two shakes over the sink removes the excess water before lathering.  Immediately when lathering is finished, the brush is returned to the soak until shaving is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always rinse the brush from the side, rotating it slowly under running water until all soap is gone.  Two quick shakes removes all of the excess water and -- here&#x27;s the trick for many, I think -- the brush is stored hanging bristles down until the next use.  Though it has a flat, stand-up base, that should only ever be used temporarily while lathering or when the bristles have fully dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value.  Great little brush.  I shave my neck and head with it every day and love it.</li>
    <li> This shave brush has held up really well over the past year and I have a lot of confidence that it will continue to for a good while longer.  Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Still works great, and travels well. Shed a few hairs at the start of use and a little though out its use, but has retained its shape.</li>
    <li> This is a seriously overlooked brush. This was my first shaving brush, and I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for three years straight now. It sheds a hair or two once in a while, but otherwise, it&#x27;s become quite soft. There are brushes that cost hundreds of dollars, and then there&#x27;s the overlooked Tweezerman for $12.00. It&#x27;s not as soft as the high-end brushes, but it exfoliates well and raises the hairs on the neck better than many softer (i.e. silver tip) brushes. This thing is bulletproof.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small this brush really was until I got it. I had been using a the one in the Van der Hagen box (from HEB), which is a boar hair brush. However, despite the size difference, the Tweezerman brush lathered easily twice as fast as the boar hair brush and felt noticeably softer against my skin. Also, this brush retains water for a VERY long time (still fairly wet after being at work for 9 hours), so extra care should be taken to ensure that it&#x27;s as dry as you can get it prior to hanging it UPSIDE DOWN. You don&#x27;t want your brand new brush to mildew, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, this initial review is a positive one. The brush is both cheap and superior to others in it&#x27;s price range. All I would change is to have half again as many bristles... maybe even twice as many if you&#x27;re a large fellow. Then again, it lathers so fast and goes on so smoothly, it may not be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for a first timer.</li>
    <li> No great disappointment, just a nice brush for a very good price. I&#x27;ve used it twice since buying and a few bristles have shed, as to be expected, but on the whole... not too bad considering. The handle is fairly well finished with no areas untouched by the protective coating. The natural bristles do have a fairly distinct odour, but I&#x27;m sure this will pass with continued use....  I hope so anyway.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 21st Aug.&lt;br /&gt;That natural bristle odour, from the brush I spoke of, has dissipated quickly. A few more hairs have shed/broken but have been slight. For it&#x27;s cost and performance, I recommend that you buy this one. I really should&#x27;ve bought two.</li>
    <li> This loses more hairs than it shaves off. From the very first day the hairs just started coming out of the base. Sticking on my face. Washing into the basin. Awful quality.</li>
    <li> I got this as a step up from a synthetic blend brush. And it does the job for providing a quality shave lather but I don&#x27;t see this Tweezerman lasting long. When the brush arrived it already had hairs falling out inside the box and the lettering was faded almost off. A subpar product but you get what you pay for. This was on sale for $8 which is the only reason I got it, I&#x27;ll gladly end up paying 3 times that to get a better brush. The hairs are dyed or mixed in some solution, when I soaked my brush in hot water to clean it the first time a residue/dye of some sort came out. Then I found hairs in my lather which inevitably ended up in my double edged razor and on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend, spend some extra cash and go with a different brand.</li>
    <li> Just got this product.  It was cheap (yay) and much better than any other brush I&#x27;ve been able to buy for $15 or less.  It is a little sparsely haired compared to some of the others that I have looked into but that&#x27;s to be expected for the bargain basement price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy 2-3 of these, at a minimum, for the same price that you would a nicer more luxurious brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something inexpensive and a small step up from boars hair, I say go for it.  (I did.)</li>
    <li> Feels nice on my face, holds water and lather just fine.  Lost about 20 bristles the first couple days, has since settled down to a tolerable 0-2 bristles per shave -- the only reason it gets four instead of five stars.</li>
    <li> I normally hate shaving with regular can shaving cream and a multi bladed monster razor so i picked up a vintage Gillette DE safety razor and this brush.  i love it.  after about 10 uses it has stopped shedding.  it works up a great lather when i do my part and compared to a can is 1,000 times better.  i also use to break out with pimples alot until i started shaving with a brush and DE razor.  Not sure why but im not going to question it.</li>
    <li> Love Tweezerman products.  I ordered one of these brushes several years ago and love it.  Just ordered a replacement and the hairs are all falling out.  Definitely returning.</li>
    <li> The brush arrived as advertised in the time frame promised. The bristles are hard and shed a little for the first week. Make sure you dry your brush properly between uses to maximize brush life. For the price this product worked as well as I expected it to.</li>
    <li> In the military we used these for cleaning weapons, and they do that exceptionally well.  The short, stiff hair, and small, manueverable handle, makes this thing invaluable for cleaning dirt and debris out of the crevices of any firearm.  Add one of these to your gun cleaning kit today!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush about 3 times, but every time, it sheds quite a bit.  One redeeming quality about this brush is that the hair it covers my face in is actually badger hair, I looked but didn&#x27;t see mention of this in the product description.  I am new to wet shaving, so I really don&#x27;t know if it is normal for brushes like this one to shed, or at least for them to shed so much.  More often than not, it really is true that you get what you pay for.  I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this brush unless you just really need the cheapest one possible, that really is what this one is.</li>
    <li> soon as water hits this brush it literally makes your entire bathroom smell like 50 soaking wet dogs. it&#x27;s so bad it honestly smells borderline feces like, used once, threw into trash, and proceeded to spray air fresheners and run fans in my bathroom AND connecting bedroom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good entry level brush. But in my first 5 days of owning it mine has lost bristles every day; I don&#x27;t think it will last longer than a month or two. If you&#x27;re just getting into wet shaving, this isn&#x27;t a bad start but most likely you&#x27;ll be purchasing a better brush sooner or later. My advise is to spend a little more to get a brush that will last you longer. If you&#x27;re just starting out wet shaving I&#x27;d recommend getting a combo set with a hanger.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. The bristles are soft and lather well. Genuine badger hair. In person, it looks higher quality than in photos. The only con is that the bristles fall out from time to time, though, this is very typical of any brush.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and, unlike its predecessor, the brush is holding up without shedding bristles.  The price is right and it works fine.  Never having used any of its very expensive competitors, I may not know what I&#x27;m missing, but I get a good shave and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> .......nice little brush......... sheds a bit in the beginning, but eventually it stopped shedding... nice travel brush...due to the price, no worries if you lose it...</li>
    <li> As far as applying shave cream the Tweezerman is great. However after 6 months or so the bristles/metal cup fell out of the wood handle. I glued them back with no issues. Next the clear coat started peeling off the handle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;ll be upgrading to a silver tip eventually I&#x27;m sure. But really have not had any problems at all. No smell, nothing falling out...just fine.</li>
    <li> The brush part fell off the handle after three or four uses. I would not recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> Got this when I started shaving with a safety razor and it works as intended. The first few uses had quite a few loose strands escape but now it absorbs water and does not shed.</li>
    <li> Remarkable that this brush generates so much better lather so much more easily than my old, boar brush. I just hope it holds up. I put a screw hook on the top of the handle so I can hang it to dry.</li>
    <li> I got this shaving brush off of Amazon for my husband in January 2013 (on my separate account). He has been using it regularly since then, and for a while I used it as well. Then at a small, local thrift store, I found a new, sealed in plastic shaving brush. It had no brand name on the plastic seal or on the handle. The thrift store had a couple of them. It has a solid wooden base, and I have no idea what type of hair it consists of. I paid a whopping 50 cents for it. When I first used it, I realized how much this Tweezerman sucks in comparison. I wish I had gone back to buy the other no-name brand version at the thrift store at that time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time we use the Tweezerman, it sheds.  Before purchasing any of our shaving equipment, I did a lot of reading on Reddit, so I do know that you must hold the base in your hand and use your fingers to hold together the bristles as your work your lather. In spite of this, it sheds. I just grabbed it for this review, and I can sit here and pull out hairs probably all night long. When I lathered my legs for shaving, it would leave stray hairs on me, which would then clog the razor if I did not pick them off before shaving. It was just a hassle all around. On the other hand, my no-name brand lucky thrift store find does not shed a single hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the shedding, the no-name brand forms a better lather than the Tweezerman, and it also seems to lift the hairs on my legs better before shaving. It seems to have a better structure to it, too. The bristles do not bend or flare out as much as the Tweezerman  For some reason, my husband continues to use the Tweezerman; it may be a case of His vs. Hers, and it can also be because he says he doesn&#x27;t like &amp;#34;change&amp;#34;. Apparently the shedding is not a deal breaker to him every morning. Regardless, I plan on replacing this for him with a better brand.</li>
    <li> Good brush for the price.  Stiff enough to lather a hard soap but not scratchy once it is broken in.</li>
    <li> This brush has been a good brush for me. Unfortuately, I&#x27;ve dropped it several times, and the lacquer on the wood has cracked and is starting to chip off as a result. Still servicable though. I do get the occasional hair falling out in the shaving cream, but nothing that has hindered the use yet.</li>
    <li> This brush does a much better job than one that I bought at a local pharmacy. I am able to get a good lather and it holds an appropriate amount of water to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Good brush over all but it does loose a lot of hair while making lather. I thought it might stop but after just over two weeks my cup is full of badger hair.</li>
    <li> I started out shaving with a safety razor in December.  My wife filled my Christmas list with the Merkur 180 razor and a Van Der Hagen Shaving Soap kit, which includes a bowl, boar brush and cup.  I asked for the kit, thinking there couldn&#x27;t be that much of a difference between brushes.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boar brush in the kit is adequate, but I couldn&#x27;t get a good soap &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; consistently.  I would get a flat soap covering, rather than a nice, thick coating.  Using the boar brush on your face is like buying a throw-away paint brush to paint your house.  It will work, but the results will not be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I received my Tweezerman brush, I could get a good soap whip, allowing for better soap coverage on my face.  This lets me get a much more consistent shave.  The badger hair also gives a more defoliating effect, softening skin after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first few days of use, there were several hairs that shed from the brush.  Based upon the other reviews, this is normal and has stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that if you spent more money, you could get a better brush.  For the money, this is a great badger brush that is much better than a boar brush.</li>
    <li> I knew it would have a smell so no point in taking a star away. Lathers up soap real well and applies real well. Did see a few hairs come out but that&#x27;s the nature of the beast. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> When you consider that other brushes may run 30.00 and more, this little 10.00 gem does the trick&lt;br /&gt;of coating your face very well.  If you&#x27;re using a quality shaving cream. it will hold a generous amount&lt;br /&gt;until you&#x27;re finished with the shave. So far, for me, it has proven to be durable.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for over 6 months and have liked it very much. My only qualm with it is that it sheds alot, not that its very noticable but eventually i will notice and will have to replace it. That is the only reason its getting 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> First I like to thank for the tips a previous writer wrote on how to take care of the brush, awesome . Excellent starter brush, there are more expensive brushes out their this one works extremely well.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush so I didn&#x27;t want to spent a lot incase it wasn&#x27;t for me. The Tweezerman is a great brush at a great price!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be mistaken, there are better brushes out there. But to find a better brush for the money you will be hard pressed (the Frank&#x27;s Shaving line will beat it for a bit more money). 5 Stars for value vs. quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my daily and travel brush and has been for several months now. I was a bit alarmed at the number of hairs it lost the first week. This quickly cured itself, and has lost a rare hair perhaps once a week after it broke in. I regularly shampoo and condition the brush as I do all my brushes to promote long life. It still dries to a nice full bloom and quickly whips up a nice lather with any soap I choose be it cream or puck. Using a scuttle or face lathering as I do on the trips, it performs very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a luxury weekend shave I have other brushes that will outperform this one. For someone new to wet shaving, or for an old timer like me that wants a nice everyday shave, it will find a place in your rotation.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. I bought it and the head of the brush didn&#x27;t hold. I had to buy super glue to attach it.</li>
    <li> Not good badger hair quality, Cheap, It hurts when using on face. I have others that feels so smooth. U get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> For the Price you can&#x27;t beat this brush.  Thats it thats all.  Seriously.  I am just writing still because they don&#x27;t let you make these too short.</li>
    <li> This was my first shave brush. I bought it on 11/1/2012. I initially loved the price point and i had read that after a few shaves it would most likely stop shedding. That never happened. This brush shed at least 10 hairs per shave, every shave. It got to the point that when I would shake the water out of the brush that a few hairs would fall out. I took excellent care of the brush making sure to dry it in a brush holder and to never leave any soap in it. Today as I was shaking the water out of the brush for a shave the knot flew right out of the handle. Good thing I have a backup brush. What a piece of garbage this brush is.</li>
    <li> I have been usin this brush for just over two yard now with good results. The brush has held up well and basically looks an feels like it did when I first bought it. It lost a hair here and there but not in any appreciable or noticeable amount, and it certainly hasn&#x27;t affected the functionality of the item. It lathers up quickly and is soft and easy to clean. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I just started wet shaving recently and someone recommended that I use badger brushes over boar or other materials.  There was initial shedding/hair loss from the brush but after several uses that has decreased.  This brush has great value and I would definitely purchase another one.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush and it still does the job after a year and a half of use.  I initially would lose the occasional hair from the brush early on through several shaves, but it&#x27;s pretty rare now--perhaps it simply needs a \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period.  I actually get better lathers now than when I first got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously there are better brushes out there for more money, and I knocked off a star due to that difference in feel.  But if you&#x27;re just getting started in DE shaving or simply want to save a few bucks, this is a great purchase that can be used at home or for travel.</li>
    <li> I use this brush with a shaving whip from a local store Scentually Yours.  The brush provides a smooth spread and works wonderfully.  I have used this brush with shaving soap and builds a quick thick lather.  The brush is an excellent choice for those wjo prefer old style shaving.</li>
    <li> Keep in mind this is just one guys experience with the brush and there are many reviews that love the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like the brush. I have several other brushes I like much better. Omega, Frank Shaving and so on&lt;br /&gt;First thing I don&#x27;t care for is the handle. I prefer a brush with a larger handle while this Tweezerman has a smaller handle this is just a personal thing.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I don&#x27;t like about the brush is the bristles which is the real problem for me. The bristles on my brush are stiff and felt like small needles sticking in your face when working in the shaving soap. My face burned for 3 days after using this brush. The only thing I had changed in my normal daily shaving was the brush. The brush smelled like a dead animal when it arrived. I cleaned the brush and even put conditioner on it trying to kill the smell and soften it up a bit. I have put this brush back on it&#x27;s hanger and went back to using my Frank Shaving Brush, much softer and holds a ton of soap.&lt;br /&gt;I say this again this is just my personal experience with the brush and I haven&#x27;t had this problem with any of my other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a follow up from my first review and thought i would try the brush out again a few weeks later. I have found that the hairs are continually  falling out, stuck in my shaving soap and getting stuck to my face and in my razor. To me this is just a poor quality brush or I just got a crap brush. I own several other brushes and none have been this bad.</li>
    <li> the brush came apart from the base.  I will never order this brand again.  I was expecting so much more...</li>
    <li> I purchased the Tweezerman Shaving Brush to go along with my new Edwin Jagger safety razor. This is my first foray into wet shaving and I admit that I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on my first shaving brush in case it didn&#x27;t go very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman brush is a solidly-built product. The badger hairs are glued to the stand and hold a good amount of water when used. I don&#x27;t have any other experience with shaving brushes, but I am guessing that this brush is probably on the rough side (you get what you pay for). Overall, I have enjoyed the wet shaving experience and the Tweezerman brush is a pleasant part of the overall experience. Having said that, I am sure that I will eventually want a more expensive, softer shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I will continue to use the Tweezerman brush. It seems to get a little softer with each use. It shed quite a bit of hair at the beginning, and that is tapering off somewhat. Again, there are some drawbacks to this brush, but, overall, I don&#x27;t regret getting it. It does its job reasonably well. I knew that it wasn&#x27;t a luxurious brush when I bought it and that is precisely what I got.</li>
    <li> After having a boar hair brush that was just so so I was looking for something better. I was told that badger hair was the way to go. I purchased this Tweezerman brush from amazon and am very happy. It holds moisture very well and is really soft. I&#x27;ve been using for about a year and it has held up nicely.</li>
    <li> I use it with Arko shaving soap. It really build a quick and thick lather. It feels good on your face too. Bristles are firmly set and dry thoroughly between shaves.</li>
    <li> an important part of a good shave is like anything else, it&#x27;s in the preparation, had to re-glue the bristles to the handle but, still a great buy, lathers quickly and spreads evenly.</li>
    <li> Great quality, especially for the price.  I upgraded from a chap synthetic brush and and very pleased with the badger hair brush.  It holds lather well and feels great on the face.  Very little hair loss, just a little with break in and an occasional piece with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> After searching for a badger brush to enter my safety-razor-shaving switchover, I decided to give this one a try, solely because it&#x27;s a badger brush, yet a fraction of the price of other shaving brushes. In fact, I passed over this brush several times BECAUSE OF THE PRICE, thinking that it COULDN&#x27;T POSSIBLY be a badger brush for that price... and yet, it seems to be, as far as I can tell, based on my lather and wear so far. I finally ordered it figuring \\&quot;what have I got to lose for the price?\\&quot;-- and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, I&#x27;ve also had an issue with a few bristles falling out during my first few shaves. They work their way out of the cluster and get washed away during my rinse. Honestly, I can&#x27;t even tell they&#x27;re gone-- the brush has only gotten better for me the more I use it. Granted, it may not be the ELITE silver-tipped badger hair, but heck, it works great for my needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m losing about 5 hairs exactly with every shave as well!  I thought it would slow down after the first couple weeks but continues to lose 3-6 hairs every shave.  Yes people, I treat it gently, yes it dries hanging, etc.  Doesn&#x27;t matter.  Pain in the ass.  I think just as with any other cheap product the intent is great, but quality control often suffers.  Quality control is difficult in the first place when you&#x27;re using the fur from an animal, but multiply that by the probably 100,000 of these Tweezerman made and it&#x27;s easy to understand why this can happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bright side is the cheap price, essentially the badger experience, minus the longevity. I accidentally added two to my cart, but it&#x27;ll probably take another year for this thing to \\&quot;go bald\\&quot;.  I just don&#x27;t like having long hairs in my shave mug, or on my face!  Only thing I can say about this brush is to rub it back and forth on your fingers before shaving, when it&#x27;s dry from hanging, those hairs will fall off that loosened while drying, before they get into your mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated 3* because I would&#x27;ve rather paid more for one that didn&#x27;t shed, than have to buy one that does, and then a new one in the future.  A good badger brush can last for a decade or more, I don&#x27;t expect this one to last more than a year with proper treatment and shaving every other day.</li>
    <li> I just converted to a double edge razor from the Gilette Fusion...I was getting tired of spending close to $30 for refill cartridges to refill! Anyways, the brush is a brush - it shed a little bit, but from what I read that is to be expected. It did a great job developing a lather and felt good on my face. The only negative I would say, and I&#x27;ve seen it in other reviews, is take the time to shampoo the brush before you use it. The brush has a funky odor, it&#x27;s not terrible - but it&#x27;s not exactly something you want around your nose for an extended period of time. Besides that, this product does what you need it to do without spending too much!</li>
    <li> I went looking for good quality shaving brushes, but couldn&#x27;t afford a high price tag. After much searching, review checking, etc I purchased the Tweezerman. It is not the softest, but not the coarsest. It lathers up soap into a lovely froth. The hairs handle the abuse well and doesnt fall apart. The handle is wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a bargain shaving brush to use with double edged razors then look no further.</li>
    <li> This brush is great.  Unlike some other shaving brushes which I have owned, it loses very few bristles.  A good value.</li>
    <li> This thing lost quite a few hairs initially, and then the entire brush head just fell off the handle. I only used it about 10 times.</li>
    <li> The brush came out of the package looking good.  After soaking the brush in some hot water and lathering up some soap I was pretty excited to use it.  After two weeks of daily use, making sure to dry it immediately after use, the brush came apart from the handle while I was lathering.  It had worked pretty well up to that point and I am assuming by all of the good reviews that this is a rare case, but it should be pointed out in case others come across the same problem.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought a brush since the 80s, and I never used one the right way. So, when I decided to return to DE shaving, I went to Amazon and found this great brush. It is my first badger hair brush, and I have been using it for just over a year now with several different brands of soaps. It is holding up great, hasn&#x27;t lost any hairs, and it has held its shape. I always rinse the brush and shake it before I hang it upside down to dry. I believe that is the secret to a long useful life.</li>
    <li> Bought this because the bristles were falling out of the cheap one I bought  a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was the much finer bristles. They are thinner, more tightly packed, and softer. Though, there is a bit of prickliness when applying the soap to my face. Leaves a nice layer of soap, thin in dimension, but thick in body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice.</li>
    <li> I like the brush as far as size, how it lathers and it is a nice brush. However it does shed quite a bit. I have used it @5-6 times and it is better but it still sheds.</li>
    <li> I like the cheep fake badger wide brush from walmart that came with the soap. But its ok after it sheds the loose hair.</li>
    <li> A very good brush. The only thing I did not like is that it has a small handle. Had it been a little longer, would have given 5 stars.</li>
    <li> For a first time brush this would be great. And it might just be that mine was a lemon, but the bristles of this brush fall out like crazy. I&#x27;d assume a few would fall out over time but not like it does.</li>
    <li> This brush is mediocre at best and quite prone to failure. I suggest [[ASIN:B004W17O7A Ecotools Bamboo Finishing Kabuki, 0.15 Pounds (Pack of 2)]]. For essentially the same price you get TWO brushes. These are make-up brushes but they make excellent shaving brushes and feel very good on the face. And they have no bad odor. Brush the soap until the bubbles in the lather being formed at microscopic, then bring brush to you (wet, washed) beard and work the lather up and into your stubble. The brush holds plenty of lather for multiple passess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better and cheaper: what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> I tried a cheap Jaguar shaving brush that had plastic like bristles that only lasted a few months. Pay the few extra bucks for this Tweezerman! I&#x27;ve since moved up to an expensive Art of shaving brush but its not THAT much better- it is bigger and stiffer than this one though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower &amp; wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100&#x27;s on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don&#x27;t press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I&#x27;ve tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don&#x27;t want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3&#x27;s are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you&#x27;ll notice a difference overnight.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush is the bomb.  It simply breaks in very easy, gathers the shave soap onto the bristles wonderfully and holds up like new over the years. I purchased a second shave brush “just in case” however the first brush is working perfectly fine.  Simply make sure you allow the bristles to dry by laying the brush flat or using a holder with the bristles pointing downward. You can t go wrong with the Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush .</li>
    <li> I bought this as first shaving brush, and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looses a lot of hair at first. After the initial cleaning, the lost several hairs, but not enough to affect its use in anyway. Each subsequent shave I&#x27;ve been losing a few, but it seems to be diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the softest thing in the world, but it gets the job done. I&#x27;d buy it again, as a starter, but will probably get something a little nicer when this one is done.</li>
    <li> I kinda expected this brush to fall apart after a while because it was pretty cheap; however, I&#x27;m still using this brush over a year after I bought it. It works great and was a great value! I initially lost a fair amount of bristles when the brush was brand new, and have lost some sporadically since. However, it is still very full. The bristles are soft, and I am glad I bought this brush. Great Deal!</li>
    <li> First things first. Right out of the package I could see that for under $15.00 this was a decent Badger bristle brush. Then it disappeared! Apparently there was some latent smell. That and the easy to grasp bristles which made it a tempting thing for my cat. I had placed it on the coffee table just after opening the box, and she was on it like a mouse... After retrieving it I took it for a shave. I wet the brush in hot water and rinsed it a couple of times and then hung it to dry overnight. The next morning I wet it and lathered up. The brush is a bit too soft for my liking, and it spreads a bit wide, but I have been used to a cruddy boar brush, and may not know what a luxury it is. Meanwhile after rinsing and shaving, and rinsing again I noticed the cat eying the top of the bathroom sink...</li>
    <li> Not as good as the high end brushes, but a really good brush for the price. Bristles are coarse enough to handle my wire like beard, yet don&#x27;t irritate my face. Brush dries well and holds water well for a nice lathering of my Taylor of Old Bond Street shave creams.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my brush for months now and it works really well, it really helps to get the hair up and spreads the soap perfectly.</li>
    <li> item exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 5 years and it still looks new. The bristles still produce a lovely lather and the wood handle provides excellent grip. Great brush for the money.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning weapons and keyboards.  never use this item for the intended purpose.  it was offered at a good price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I saw some markdowns before I bought this brush for bristles shedding.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with shedding.  I use this every day and rinse well and hang to drive after every use.</li>
    <li> I recently got tired of the ridiculous expense of shaving with the major razor brands like Gillette and Schick, so I made the switch to the more traditional safety razor method with cream and a brush.  I wasn&#x27;t really sure if I&#x27;d like this method, so I tried to keep the initial costs on the accessories (like this brush) as low as possible.  As it turns out, I love this shaving style and would never go back to the overpriced junk razors sold in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t complain too much for the price.  It is Badger hair brush and doesn&#x27;t feel too coarse on the face, but the old adage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; really does come into play with this product.  Like I said, the product is Badger hair, but you can tell this brush is not made from the softer fur of the animal (i.e. the &#x27;silvertip&#x27; neck hairs) like some of the more expensive brushes available.  There are definitely multiple grades of quality with these brushes, with this one being firmly in the lowest grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have issues with fraying and shedding.  I usually lose a couple hairs with each shave, and the outside strands have trouble re-forming with the rest of the brush.  And, yes, to anyone who may comment on this statement, I am aware of the proper care procedure, and I do not leave the brush sitting on its handle to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is great for someone looking to experiment with this style of shaving (like I was) and not wanting to spend 50-60 dollars on a high quality silvertip shaving brush or for someone who&#x27;s okay with planned obsolescence and is willing to replace it every few months with a new one.  Personally, this brush has served its purpose for me in getting me started with this shaving style, and I will probably get a better quality brush very soon.</li>
    <li> Very nice and it got here when they said.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. It&#x27;s rare that you get great quality and a low price in a product nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the idea of a shaving brush from a store dedicated entirely to shaving in a high-end shopping center in San Francisco.  Of course, their shaving brushes started at $35 and the high end was $70 which I though was pretty high. Imagine my surprise when I saw it on Amazon for $8 when I first started using it two years ago.  I have now purchased a second brush to keep in my travel kit as I forgot it on our last trip and really missed the great shave a full head of lather provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had switched to all natural hair and skin products about two years previously and was using Weleda shaving cream after using a gel silicone type preparation for many years that was loaded with chemicals. (I have no connection to the Weleda company and provide this only as information for those who want to research organic products.)  I had been spreading the cream around on my face with my fingertips but was unable to work up a satisfactory lather.  This brush works unbelievably!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  1. Very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;  2. My original brush is still in excellent condition after two years of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  1.  Yes, there is an odor when you first start using it.  It is badger hair after all; but it will go away after a short time.&lt;br /&gt;  2.  Some of the bristles will come out with each use but this will also stop after a period of time.  Just be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:  As with some reviewers, I have found that some minimal care is required to get the best use of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;  1. Always rinse the brush under warm running water after each use.&lt;br /&gt;  2. Gently compress the brush sideways to expel as much water as you can from the brush.&lt;br /&gt;  3. Never dry the brush standing up on its base.  I lay the brush on its side in a small 3 X 4&amp;#34; plastic kitchen storage container with no lid on and a folded-up piece of paper towel in the bottom that I change every two weeks to prevent bacteria growth. You can alternatively purchase a brush holder stand and use that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid to give it a try.  If you enjoy a clean, comfortable shave, this is the brush to get.</li>
    <li> A little aggressive, definitley sheds during first few uses (as it is probably supposed to), but an overall decent brush. You&#x27;ll definitely want to upgrade if classic shaving becomes your thing, though.</li>
    <li> My wife and I keep one of thes brushes by the kitchen sink and use it to clean our glasses. We wet it, rub it lightly on a cake of soap, and then clean the glasses. Works great. After rinsing the brush we give it a good wrist flip to snap out the water, then store it bristles-up on a little dish. It still looks like new after a couple of years of this. I may be going to buy a second one to use to apply body powder to some tender anatomical parts that suffer after prostatectomy surgery.</li>
    <li> Very soft. Lots of lather. Brush never stopped stinking no matter how many times I washed it and eventually fell apart.</li>
    <li> Sent this to my buddy and he loves it, really likes the fact it is real badger tail. Goes well with a shaving bowl too.</li>
    <li> great brush, still have it, working perfect. loss some hairs in the beginning, but now is SOLID. I recommend this brush</li>
    <li> I have been using the Tweezerman badger brush for approximately 3 weeks. It has performed very well. It is a very inexpensive brush so I didn&#x27;t expect great things from it. It is soft, hold water well and lathers great with my green Proraso soap. My brush does shed. I clean it after use, hold it at the knot when using it, dry it with the bristles down and follow the guidance found here in other reviews. But my brush sheds a bristle or two each use. That being said, I would buy this brush again in a second. It has very good quality bristles, soft and full. For a beginners brush, it meets or exceeds all expectations. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just started shaving with a real razor, and this is the second brush I have owned.  The one that came with my art of shaving starter pack was very small and felt uncomfortable to work with.  This one feels great in the hand, and fits my stand perfectly.  A lot of bristles came out in the first use, but I believe this is normal and i have not noticed anymore since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels comfortable in hand and on my face, and works up a nice lather.</li>
    <li> First im a noob when it comes to traditional wet shaving. This brush is GREAT for the price you pay for it, after further research i wish i had not have purchased it. I already had a perfectly good boar brush that i had gotten in a starter kit. I heard online how much better badger was to boar and honestly the lowest grade of badger hair is not that much a step up from the boar hair brush that i already had. IMO skip the lowest badger grade and get the mid grade hairs if you can afford it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is still a quality well made product. Im really just annoyed that i have two things that perform the same, if this is your first brush then by all means go for it, if it isn&#x27;t get the next grade of brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for more info on traditional shaving head over to badgerandblade.com for more info!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of poor ratings for this product, but I have to say with proper care, its a great brush.  I will attempt to address the problems several have commented on from my experience with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shedding:  Yes, brushes do shed, especially if they&#x27;re under $20.  I simply soaked the brush and combed out all the loose hairs.  No more shedding after that and I&#x27;ve had the brush well over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odor: My brush did have a slight &amp;#34;wet animal&amp;#34; odor.  I shampooed the brush with a coconut scented shampoo my wife uses.  I left the lather on for about an hour before rinsing it very well.  That took care of the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also hang my brush to dry with the knot hanging down.  This is the proper way to store your brush.  Also, when you shake water out of your brush, hold the retaining ring with the tips of your fingers with the handle resting in your palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the brush for over a month now and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  I like a coarser-haired brush that really exfoliates the skin.  This brush serves that purpose very well and produces a very nice lather.  I make my own soap using an African black soap based shaving butter melted and mixed well with a basic soap natural soap base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I am very pleased with this brush.  Shipping was fast and the price was extremely affordable.  Overpaying for a brush just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me and this brush is fully capable of being used everyday when properly cared for.  This is a very good brush to purchase and I highly recommend it.  Once its broken in, its a great brush.</li>
    <li> I like this brush.  Unlike the retail outlet one it replaces, I&#x27;m not quickly loosing the whiskers.  I&#x27;ll buy this brush again.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush and it has worked great so far. Bristles holding up lathers up real good and very well priced.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush. It spreads the Azor gel evenly. It&#x27;s easy to rinse out the excess gel and the bristles dry well. Use it daily in shower.</li>
    <li> This brush is very feels very good on your skin and you can get a good lather which helps you blades glide over you skin when shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my huband back for Christmas. He was new to double edge shaving and had never uses a brush before. He uses this on his face and head daily. The product is well made. I received the shipment within only a few days. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done but it has a terrible shedding problem. I&#x27;ts good for a budget buy but I see a higher quality brush in the near future.</li>
    <li> This brush is just wonderful...the feel and softness make this brush very special...yes I would recommend this brush to others. Shaving Brushes are not found in many local beauty stores...I visited six store, no brushes were stocked.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this brush to friends and anyone in need of a shaving brush.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my man and he loves it! Says it helps give him the best shaves of his life &amp; I agree!</li>
    <li> Great beginner brush.  Minor shedding first two to three uses, but very solid performance after that initial break in period.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Shaving Brush for years and this is the best brush I have ever used.  I had just priced a brush at a store in the mall of the same quality and it sold for $70.00.  Great value GREAT BRUSH!!!!</li>
    <li> Received brush and it is as claimed in other reviews.  Good foaming action and the size is right for my hand.  Minor bristle shedding, but overall pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stab your face like some cheaper brushes do. It has high quality bristles that massage my face better than my girlfriend.</li>
    <li> Actually use this to wash my face in the shower.  It stinks like wet dog the first few times i used it - maybe for a week or so and now it is just fine.  Love how soft the bristles are, but it cleans my face really well.</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price. Time will tell of the durability.</li>
    <li> This was my first shaving brush, and I&#x27;ve gotten quite hooked on shaving this way now and can&#x27;t quite imagine returning to the days of using big spray cans of Gillette shaving gel. I&#x27;ve been using this brush almost daily for coming up on two years now (purchased Nov. 2012 from Amazon), so this is a review from a long-use perspective. There was a period where it shed a noticeable number of bristles -- 1 to 3 lost on a near-daily basis over a couple of weeks&#x27; time -- I can assume this was just some spots where the adhesive wasn&#x27;t good or something. Once that period of shedding was over, it&#x27;s been fine. Rarely loses a bristle (perhaps once a month?) and it never lost so many as to really impact the density. Despite best-use and proper storage techniques, the wooden handle cracked slightly a few months in, so I used some clear epoxy-type glue to just fill it in. This too has never been a problem since. So yes, there were a couple of issues, and I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re endemic to this product across its production or if I just got a bad one, but apart from these two problems, I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the brush, particularly given its entry-level price point. After the initial problems and just under a year after buying the Tweezerman, I bought another brand &amp;#34;pre-emptively,&amp;#34; kind of anticipating the imminent failure of the Tweezerman. That subsequent purchase is actually still new in its box, sitting in my closet. Maybe one day, I&#x27;ll relegate the Tweezerman to &amp;#34;travel shaving brush&amp;#34; status and break out the new one, but for now, nearly two years on, it&#x27;s still doing the job admirably.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and feels good when you put the lather on your face.  The brush feels like it will last a long time.  I know another person that used this product, and he recommended it to me.  I thought I needed a more expensive brush but this works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Lathers the cream easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None (after a week of using this product)</li>
    <li> I have had this for 3 years, now. It is a great brush for a low price. It was a soothing upgrade from my boar brush. It has lost very little bristles over the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it now. It comes highly recommended. Especially if you&#x27;re just starting out. You can test out how you enjoy wet shaving with a quality brush on a budget.</li>
    <li> Excellent first brush, I had it for a year until I lost my stand, stopped taking care of it, and it broke. It&#x27;s all my fault though, and I&#x27;ve since bought two more of these for friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you buy a stand. As other commenters mention, if it&#x27;s wet when you leave it in the position in the picture (standing on the base), eventually it will crack and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to wash it out, flick it a couple times to get rid of water, and then put it in a stand where it can drip dry.</li>
    <li> I liked the brush. It is working very well for me. I think it is loosing to many hair too fast. But I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift, and  will give it for fathers day as part of a set I am putting together.</li>
    <li> The brush is well constructed, decently priced and work well ... However, it has a funny smell to it when wet. What the hell is that? I am going to see if the odor goes away with time,. ... Other wise the brush will go away (back to it&#x27;s seller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/13/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unreasonable and hard on the Tweezerman shaving brush. The smell is gone. The brush works well and is one of my favorite among the 5 I rotate and use. It is soft, holds a lot of lather and is well constructed. It does not lose any bristles either. It strongly resembles my Escali brush. Only it is larger and fuller. I would recommend this brush to anyone who wants a nice shaving brush at a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards, D. Paganelli</li>
    <li> I tried this brush based on a recommendation from reddit.com/r/wickededge, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving, and like most people I have been trying to find the sweet spot between affordability and quality. I tried a few other brushes first, but they either felt like I was wire brushing my face or else they shed like a dog in August.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush feels soft but firm on the face, it lathers well, and it&#x27;s been holding up well to regular use. I clean it, dry it, and hang it bristles-down after every use, so I&#x27;m hoping that it continues to work well for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I like this better than the other brush I&#x27;ve used that was not badger hair. I think it was boar hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The badger hair in this brush seems a little prickly at first, but it works up a lather ten times better and spreads it on quite well. My main reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it does seem like the hairs come out rather quickly. My last brush did not last very long (maybe 9 or 10 months) and I suspect this one will be replaced a little earlier than I&#x27;d like, as well. But, for near $10, you get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
    <li> This is my second shaving brush and I am very impressed with it.  Very little bristle loss after the first couple uses and its not lost any in the past 8 uses.  The price is also very reasonable for the look and quality.  It has a more natural wood color than the picture would lead you to believe which is exactly why I bought it, looks great.  As far as quality, I have said it before and will say it again.  You cannot dry this standing up....none of these brushes are meant for that.  They all use what seems to be a type of wood glue to hold it together and it will fall apart if you do this often.  Do yourself a favor and hang it upside down using a brush and razor holder like it was intended.  One last thing, its a bit smaller than you may be use to but after a while it will grow on you quickly.  I would not trade it for another at this point in time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for two years now, and it&#x27;s still working well.  I&#x27;ve only lost a few bristles on it, and it&#x27;d likely last for another few years.  Be sure to store it on it&#x27;s side (which I did for the first year) or using a holder, do NOT let it dry like the item picture shows.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying this is probably the best $10 brush you can buy.  Then I will say that there are A LOT of more expensive brushes, and I mean even $30 -$50 that are much better than this brush.  If you are trying to go cheap to see if wet shaving is something you want to do before you invest big money, then this is an ok brush to get you started, however most who love wet shaving will say don&#x27;t even bother.  I used this brush to get started about a year ago and it got me to a place where I wanted to experience something different.  A Thater and a Chubby 2 later, I have a small brush collection and long ago gave this brush to someone else who was interested in wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story, if you are just starting, maybe go with a $50 Thater unless you really aren&#x27;t sure if you will like it at all, then use this brush to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I orginally bought this brush to use it on my cat. Her fur is usually ruffled and a total mess. Not only did it take forever to brush her due to the small size, but it didn&#x27;t smooth it out at all! This product literally turned her into a feline ball of  static electricity! She was shocking herself on every metal object for over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a licensed and highly recommended vet, I do NOT endorse this product for use on animals!</li>
    <li> Well firstly theres nothing technical about  a brush, i came across some really expensive ones like the one from art of shaving which costs 55 USD, however i went and bought this one and yes i will admit that the art of shaving badger brush is maybe a tad softer but barely and the price difference is huge, also its used to lather up the shaving cream which it does perfectly so im happy and satisfied, one less star for not being as soft but i dont want a feather rubbing on my face and falling asleep either so its ok..</li>
    <li> This brush lives up to every review I read about it.  If you will take the time to rinse it and store it as the instructions say, this brush will last a very long time.  I am super pleased with it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of these over the years (4 or 5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better badger brush with a solid wood handle.&lt;br /&gt;More expensive silver tipped bristles may be softer but consequently won&#x27;t ex-foliate or lather as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that every badger&#x27;s fur is NOT exactly alike.&lt;br /&gt;Of the brushes I have used, some were softer and stinkier, but all worked reasonably well after breaking them in.&lt;br /&gt;Some tend to loose bristles more than others, but this usually tapers off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  TO GET THE STINK OUT&lt;br /&gt;Work baby oil (tea tree oil works a bit better, but is more expensive) into the brush the way you would lather up soap (hold the handle--not the bristles), and work it out with generous amounts of toothpaste (baking soda &amp; peroxide tooth paste).  This will clean out and diffuse the oil-based \\&quot;skunky\\&quot; smell better than soap.  This will also make the bristles more stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  TO FIX A LOOSE KNOT&lt;br /&gt;The first brush I purchased had a loose knot that shed bristles and eventually fell out of the handle.  I glued it back in with shoe glue and never had anymore troubles. Actually, after fixing that brush it was virtually indestructible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  TO CARE FOR YOUR BRUSH&lt;br /&gt;The brush I treated like a delicate flower (storing upside down, gently lathering with no pumping, etc.) was the one that shed bristles &amp; eventually fell apart.  A brush held together with an adequate amount of glue will have ZERO PROBLEMS.&lt;br /&gt;I have since learned to simply leave my brushes bristle up on the shelf in the shower. Some times I rinse the lather out (before I put it back on the shelf) and sometimes I don&#x27;t (soap is a drying agent--works against rot).&lt;br /&gt;Always rinse out the brush before use.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line - if your brush has problems, fix it - there is no need to coddle it.</li>
    <li> so I sanded the handle and painted with a wood stainer  and it looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve  been using for a week , i cant compare it with  another since is my first shaving brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush in October 2010 and have used it since then.  It works well and has lost no more than a dozen bristles in two years of use.  Like any shaving brush it needs to be well rinsed, dried after use and then stored hanging tip down. Treated correctly, I think this brush will last a very long time. The bristles are a little shorter than on the Parker brush I previously review, but it had no smell when new.</li>
    <li> I think I am treating it well--drying bristles down, holding the base of the bristles to protect the knot, not overloading with water, etc.-- but the thing just keeps shedding.  I know it&#x27;s not a particularly high quality brush, and it does get the job done, I just don&#x27;t like picking hairs off my cheeks every third day.</li>
    <li> This is my everyday brush and it works fine. At first I did have trouble with some of the hairs falling out but stopped soaking the brush in very hot water. I think that was affecting the glue that holds the knot together. Now I just dip the brush in hot water, not deep enough to get the knot wet. I also hang it bristles down to let it dry. This stopped the loss of hairs and I&#x27;ve used it for 6 months now. This is definitely a great value for a badger brush so it gets top ratings for the price.</li>
    <li> A very well made &amp; attractive shaving brush. I&#x27;ve owned a few cheap shaving brushes &amp; decided to buy an authentic badger fur type. I am very impressed with it, &amp; since I have to shave, I figured giving the old school method a try might make it somewhat enjoyable. The next step will be the straight razor.</li>
    <li> Replaced a boars brush I have. This one is great for the price. Lathers up well, soft. I&#x27;d recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> For my Christmas with the razor and other item he asked for them so that is what I got him</li>
    <li> This shaving brush is pretty great. It losens beard hair &amp; feels pretty good on the skin, but it does lose the hair sometimes.</li>
    <li> So, I was reading the mixed reviews, and decided for the price to take a gamble. I read one review in specific that mentioned the importance of care of the product to prolong its life. Such as rinsing and hanging upside down to dry. Since I&#x27;ve been doing what this person recommended, its been working like wonders! I look forward to shaving as I&#x27;ve never used a brush before. This makes shaving so much easier, and I use way less shaving gel/cream when getting rid of the hair. I would recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> This is a terrible brush. It&#x27;s lost so many hairs. When used with a soap puck, hairs are left over on the puck. It also has a terrible smell and is prickly on the face.</li>
    <li> This is my first brush for applying shaving cream and it&#x27;s great.  As all the reviews on here state, it&#x27;s great and perfect for beginners to DE safety razor shaving too.  Get it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few synthetic, pure badger hair, and combination shaving brushes within this price range over the past few years. Do not expect such quality shaving instruments to last over two years of solid use. With that said, the Tweezerman brush is far and away the superior of ten buck brushes, based on my experience and despite loosing hairs with every lather. The bristles are stiff causing a pleasant exfoliation of the skin and gentle lifting of the beard. The brush itself holds a decent amount of water and produces a lofty lather. Though finely constructed and ergonomically sized, the wooden handle almost ensures this particular brush will not last over the two year mark. This is evidenced by the previously mentioned loss of hairs during every shave. You get what you pay for and the Tweezerman is worth the money. This will be my final ten buck brush purchase, however. I&#x27;ve spent close to $50.00 on these types of instruments in the past five years. For that amount of money I could have purchased a very fine brush and one that will last for years and years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my advise to anyone looking to purchase their first shaving brush or to upgrade from a different but still-usable ten buck brush: Bite the bullet and pay for a very nice $50 brush (with silver tip badger hair if you can swing the price). You&#x27;ll not only save money in the long run but enjoy a much niceer quality lather and shave while it pays itself off over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, however, and rarely have an additional fifty bucks lying around when your other ten-buck brush finally bites the dust, the Tweezerman is the best possible deal for the money. Just expect to do it again in two years.</li>
    <li> I previously had another brand of badger-hair brush that I liked, which never smelled like a badger. Imagine spreading &amp;#34;wet zoo-smell&amp;#34; over your face before you shave each day. That lather is right there under your nose, tainted with the oily smell of badger. I&#x27;ve rinsed and squeezed multiple times and the initial smell has dropped off, but I don&#x27;t think it ever will completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was only $10, so it&#x27;s not even worth the effort to return it, but I won&#x27;t buy this brand again. My previous brush was from Lehmans.com for about $24 and never had a bad smell.</li>
    <li> this is my third brush and I loved all of them so much I keep these as backups for when the price goes too high. If you rinse the brush properly and sit it vertical it lasts about three years with daily use.</li>
    <li> Lost some bristles initially, then settled down.  I&#x27;m lazy, and I just dunk the entire thing in the sink to rinse it, so the varnish is a little dull. I could be more carefully about drying the wood each time, if I cared about the aesthetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Still 100% functional.</li>
    <li> I was very much going forward to using this shaving brush but the smell well knock you down it starts lost hair from day one after a week of shaving \\&quot;5 times\\&quot; I toss it in the trash and said forget it. The new plastic cheapo Gellet shaving brushes made in INDIA off ebay are light years better then this. Some people get a good one some get a bad one so you got a 50% chance on what you well get... As for me the cheapo works break and no animal had to rot on a wooden stick to rub on my face to get a great shave. just a fyi</li>
    <li> For being under $10 this has been an excellent brush. It is pure badger hair so it is the best you can get and it creates a great lather with minimal cost. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> It works as described but every time I shave a few hairs come out.  It cleans up well after use.  The hairs are soft and it fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
    <li> People like to say \\&quot;a good entry level, or a good starter brush\\&quot; as if this is good to just get started. Those are my pet peeves, the Tweezerman shave brush is an excellent brush for making lather and shaving. I have no intentions on paying more for a badger brush that makes the same lather but at a lot more expensive price. We are living in a time like no other, the Tweezerman brush is as good as our grandad used at about the same as he would have payed in the day. For you men just getting into wet shaving the Tweezerman brush is a perfect brush period, DON&#x27;T fall into the expensive is somehow better trap, you only shave once a day and it is more than good enough to do the job of making lather.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are better than my last brush. It feels better on my face and makes a better lather. The reason I give only three stars and the only complaint I have is that after about two weeks of use the glue holding the bristles in the handle failed and I have to use wood glue to stick them back inside. Luckily the ring holding the bristles together worked.</li>
    <li> From what I&#x27;ve read, some people love a scratchy brush while others favor a soft one. The Tweezerman&#x27;s the first kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to another review I read here, the brush I received had no smell of any kind. I soaked it, lathered up, and although in the end I preferred a softer brush I was pretty happy with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first shaving brush I used, the soft one was the second, and so far there hasn&#x27;t been a third - so I&#x27;m far from an expert. But if your skin craves scratchiness, this may be the shaving brush for you!</li>
    <li> I use this brush with some GrandPa&#x27;s pine tar to get a good shaving lather.  Works great, the only complaint is It end up with one or two bristles left on my face/in my razor with each use.</li>
    <li> I had started out wet shaving with a brush from an Art of Shaving gift set.  I wanted to upgrade from that brush, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  The Tweezerman is a large, thick brush, and the bristles are nice and sturdy.  My only complaint would be that one or two hairs comes out each time I shave, even after about two months of use.  It&#x27;s not noticeable in the integrity of the brush, so I&#x27;d say this is a great purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaving brush daily for about four months and like it. I had looked at other brushes costing 5 times as much and find it hard to believe they would work any better than this. It shed a couple bristles the first time I used it but none after that. It does just what it is supposed to. I did buy a brush stand (also from Amazon) and strongly recommend getting one. It holds the brush with the bristles down, allowing them to dry completely. I rinse the brush each time I use it.</li>
    <li> This is just like a baby&#x27;s touch when putting on edge gel. It truly seems to make the shave better. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> i have had this brush for almost a year and by every shave i lose many hairs. It dries really fast and doesnt make good lather. I have just spent more money on Parker brush and the shaving experince comparing to using this one was improved and im much more happier. I would recemonid it for beginers but i wouldnt if someone want to feel the art of shaving.

    <li> Nice brush pretty much.  The bristle end came unglued one day in the sink.  This was annoying because I thought it was higher quality than that.  I guess not.  I super glued the bristle bunch back into the handle and have had no other issues with it since.  I still use it all the time and it does it&#x27;s job at making lather on my face.  I would still recommend buying it because of the price.</li>
    <li> Great Price. I have shaved at least 20 times with it so far. Looks like it will last a life time. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Ten years and going strong.  Really, what else is there to say??!</li>
    <li> My first inexpensive brush to use with real shaving soap. After reading some reviews here, I would suggest &amp;#34;brushing&amp;#34; and poking your palm kinda rough to break off some of the initial weak bristles so they don&#x27;t end up on your face for the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not particularly attractive on the counter, and isn&#x27;t as smooth as girls hair on my face. Not sure if brushes are supposed to be this stiff, but it puts soap on my face evenly and rinses quickly. Overall its a nice starter brush.</li>
    <li> Had this for 1 year, and it&#x27;s still going great. If I ever need another one I&#x27;m buying this again.</li>
    <li> Budget brush. Works great. Pretty soft. First week 10-15 hairs a day in the cream, second week about 5 a day. Now maybe 1or 2 each time. But I can buy another and still be way under a top line silver tip. Will buy more when needed.</li>
    <li> If you read anything about shaving, this is THE product that EVERY man should be using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of badger hair, which is kind of weird to think of shaving with badger fur, but I guess is better than any other type of hair for a shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gets the lather under the stubble for a truly smooth shave, I&#x27;m sure it also has some exfoliating features too because your face is so soft after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d 100% recommend this product to anybody who cares about how their face feels and looks after shaving.</li>
    <li> Has a smell that refuses to go away, and hairs continually to fall out. Was not as great as I&#x27;ve been led to believe.</li>
    <li> Badger hair on the outside , the inner bristles is a soft curl. I&amp;#34;m trying to figure&lt;br /&gt;what part of the badger this came from!</li>
    <li> Great Product, very smooth on skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush.  Best I&#x27;ve had yet.  Great value and product for the price.</li>
    <li> For the price it works well enough! I have had three years of use or so out of one. After a while it does start to loose bristles and its effects. Not bad for starters or a traveling brush.</li>
    <li> Great shave brush - holds all the shave soap you need and hardly ever loses a bristle!</li>
    <li> From what I hear, badger brushes can get rediculously expensive. This brush is all you need. It holds water, lathers well, and you can get a great shave using it. Hairs will fall out from time to time (more fall out when first using it). Can stand up on it&#x27;s own, and dries quicker if you spread the hairs out after using.</li>
    <li> Man does this brush smell awful. It smells like unwashed animal. Like a pen at an animal recovery center. It works okay I  guess,  but a lot of bristles have come out, which Im sure will stop eventually, but the stink of this brush is VERY disappointing. I&#x27;ve been spraying cologne on it in hopes that the stench will fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine has one from Art of Shaving, and his doesn&#x27;t reek.</li>
    <li> This is the second shaving brush I&#x27;ve purchased since converting to traditional shaving techniques. I love this brush so much more than my first one (also a badger brush I purchased locally). The stiffness of the bristles is just right (not too soft and not too hard...I know, that&#x27;s so Goldilocks) and it holds its form very well, even after many uses. One thing I learned in my newbie DE shaving status is that a shaving brush must be dried hanging down in order to keep it in good shape. I purchased a simple plastic stand on Amazon, which works great.</li>
    <li> Great value. If you use shave soap this is a must have. I feel I abused this when I first started using shave soap and it held up well.</li>
    <li> The brush is very well made, and of excellent quality. I had not used a badger bristle brush before, and there lies my only complaint. The bristles have a tendency to feel sharp on the skin, and as the soap does not seem to soften them at all, I don&#x27;t think that will change. Still, I already prefer it to my boar bristle brush.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for two months and it is truly remarkable. It produces rich lather that is easy to apply. No hair has been lost and no cracks in the handle. I don&#x27;t hang it but lay it on its side after rinsing. One quibble is the small handle, but I just ordered another so its performance  is so good forget the quibble.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for the price. I have used it for a while now and this really does help give you a better shave. It sheds a little at first but that slowed down a lot after a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and I purchased this shaving brush based on the recommendation of folks over in wicked_edge. After using it for about a week now, I&#x27;d say the brush is pretty good. The bristles are a little softer than I anticipated, so I may end up buying a boar brush just for some variation, but this works pretty well and really isn&#x27;t a huge concern. The brush lathers well with my [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shave Soap, Sensitive, 150ml/5.2 oz (147 g) Jar]], so I&#x27;m happy. As far as bristle/hair loss goes, I haven&#x27;t experienced as much as other folks who have posted reviews here. During my first two uses, I lost a few, maybe a dozen at the most. But over the past three or four uses I haven&#x27;t lost any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing that I can add to this review involves the care of the brush. I don&#x27;t want to spend $20-$25 on a stand that I don&#x27;t really need, so I looked at advice on how to care for this thing. Some people complain that if you stand it on its base, water will get in and ruin the epoxy that holds the knot to the base. From what I read, one strategy is to shake the loose water off the brush, then towel dry it before standing it on its base. Since I haven&#x27;t had the brush for but a week, I cannot comment on the long term effectiveness of this strategy. What I can say is that shaking it off and then drying it with a towel leaves it dry to the touch. Hopefully there are no problems with the knot coming lose. So far, I don&#x27;t suspect there will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this brush is perfect for how it is used by many people. It is a good first brush for people just getting into wet shaving whether DE or straight. Once you&#x27;re sure that this is going to be your permanent shave routine, then go ahead and experiment with some more expensive options out there.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for beginning and/or budget-conscious wetshavers.  I highly recommend this as a starter brush, since starting out into the world of wetshaving can be a surprisingly expensive endeavor.  This brush is a great option because it allows you to experience using a badger hair brush without having to experience the $50+ cost of most quality badger brushes.  While you&#x27;ll notice a difference in quality between this and a more expensive brush almost immediately, this brush still makes a good lather and outperforms both of the synthetic brushes I own.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to wetshaving, get this for your first brush.  It will ease the financial hurt of the transition and will remove some of the sting if you decide to abandon it later on.  If you already have some experience, there are much better brushes out there, but this could be a useful travel brush that wouldn&#x27;t bring on a panic attack if you were to lose it.  Whatever your experience level, though, for a badger hair brush you simply can&#x27;t find a better price than this.</li>
    <li> Not a bad brush. This was the first brush I purchased when I went from the canned stuff to lathering with a brush and mug. It shed a few hairs at first but not that much. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now and still use it occasionally but I prefer the semogue 830 boar brush over it. The boar brush has more backbone than this brush. This brush gets pretty floppy after about a month of shaving.</li>
    <li> This brush came up first in the search and is popular because it is inexpensive and works well enough, so it&#x27;s the one I bought. I gave it one star not because of the brush itself, but because of treatment of badgers in China to get this hair.  Had I researched first, I would never have bought any badger brush, I would have bought synthetic. I won&#x27;t say what I learned, because I don&#x27;t want my review to be offensive. I&#x27;ll just say that if you&#x27;re an animal friendly person, you may want to spend five minutes researching the source of badger hair before choosing to support this process with your purchase.  I wish I had.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to purchase a brush to improve the quality of my shaves.  I&#x27;ve been using the Tweezerman on a daily basis for about a month and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  The brush works the lather into my facial hair, allowing for a much closer shave than applying lather by hand.  The bristles seem to be of decent quality and the brush works well to create lather from gels and water, or simply spreading canned shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many other reviewers have noted, when I began using the brush it seemed that I was losing an excessive number of bristles each time I shaved.  I become more diligent about gently squeezing water from the bristles and fanning them before hanging the brush to dry and the bristle loss stopped after about two weeks.  The initial loss does not appear to have affected the fullness of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the Tweezerman to anyone curious about how a brush can contribute to a better shave.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t compare this to others as it is my first shaving brush. It lost a few hairs initially but has since stoppedl with just over 1 months use. I&#x27;m working with Arko shaving sticks, Mercur 180 and Derby blades and the results are great. a few rubs of the Arko on both cheeks and chin yields copious amounts of lather. I will update in 1 year</li>
    <li> When I first used this brush I had to spend a good 30 minutes making lathers, pulling loose hairs off, rinse, repeat. Now on my 4th shave with it I maybe get one, maybe two loose hairs a shave. I believe it will eventually stop shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a great brush. It is very soft and whips up a creamy lather very fast. I&#x27;m coming from a really junky $3 boar brush I got from a local beauty supply, I&#x27;d have to spend 10 minutes whipping lather and putting elbow grease into it like I was the karate kid. With this Tweezerman it&#x27;s so fast and easy. Wet it, whip the water off, make frothy lather in about a minute. Feels really great on the face, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this as a gift, especially not for a first-timer, because when you first use this thing it really (I mean really) sheds. But for personal use and the expectation that it will shed the first few uses and \\&quot;break in\\&quot; after that, I can give it 5 stars for its raw performance alone.</li>
    <li> New to soap and brush shaving. No real complaints with brush except it lost lots of bristles during first uses, then the bristle loss taper off. Not sure if this is normal for soap brushes. Other than that, really soft and does a good job of applying soap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item (Tweezerman) for my son. I also purchased another brand (Parker Safety) for myself.&lt;br /&gt;This product losses hair all the time. Aproximately 4 to 5 hair a day. Parker Safety brand did not lose even 5 hair in 20 days of use. Defintely spend a littile more on a better brand.</li>
    <li> Brush works effectively but I end up with Badger hair in my sink. I think it should have a better adhesive or something</li>
    <li> Three years later, and this thing still works well.</li>
    <li> 4 Month Review -After switching from Mach III razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is the listed product I am using as part of my &amp;#34;Shaving Arsenal.&amp;#34; It took me a while to find each piece needed to bring it all together. My approach was finding all the pieces that had the best reviews vs. price. Just about everything listed below was the &amp;#34;highest price&amp;#34; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much. Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors. If your ready to make the switch to a superior, and cheaper, alternative then check out the products below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: Not sure why its made of &amp;#34;Badger&amp;#34; hair but its working. Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week. Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss and I&#x27;ve had no problems. 4 months going strong. It creates a nice lather and feels good against the skin. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G647Y8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_47&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle: Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality. You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal. Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy. I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered &amp;#34;long handled.&amp;#34; Its just a tad longer than the Mach III razor I used to use. However, it’s a night and day difference compared to those &amp;#34;Safety razors.&amp;#34; It cuts very close with minimal passes. I&#x27;ve never had a shave that was this close before.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Merkur-Model-180-Handled-Safety/dp/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355613524&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;double+edge+razor+handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades: 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market but since I started out with a 100-pack it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week. I&#x27;m half Filipino so I don&#x27;t have the thickest facial hair but definably pull off a goatee without a problem.  Other than one &amp;#34;Dud&amp;#34; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use. I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor. I was worried I would be opening myself up to more &amp;#34;risk&amp;#34; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017ZECA6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand: Safety Razor stand&lt;br /&gt; Once I learned that a stand was needed for the &amp;#34;Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush&amp;#34; I decided to go with this one. Its been 4 months and the chrome is still shining well. Its sturdy, and holds my double edged razor as well as the shaving brush as if this product was made just for them. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XURHNY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_42&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Soap: Prosaro Shaving Soap&lt;br /&gt;It works but I with it had more lather. Based on previous reviews, it sounds like the amount of lather has significantly decreased. Does it work? Yes, but I like a good lather. Anyways, its been 3 months and I feel like I have maybe gone through half of this container which isn&#x27;t bad. It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00837YY18/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_44?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap Bowl: Guess I didn&#x27;t need this since I am using the Proraso Shaving Soap which is self contained. For as simple as it is, it lost two stars. There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter. The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued. In the garbage that piece went. The next star was lost due to finish. It was a pretty flat finish for chrome and you could see theseveral light scratches across it. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00404RI70/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked. Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this. Once it arrived I was right!

    <li> I keep my old generic non-boar&#x27;s hair brush in my travel case for when I&#x27;m travelling, if I decide to shave on the road.  Usually, I stick with an electric razor since it&#x27;s easier to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use my non-Tweezerman&#x27;s brush this past holiday when visiting family.  About 10 seconds in to building lather on my face, I threw it into the neighboring waste basket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could I ever use anything less than the fine quality of the Tweezermans?</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product and was hoping my experience would be better than some of the other reviewers here complaining of lost bristles and handles splitting and cracking, but I wasn&#x27;t even given the opportunity to try this shaving brush out. The packaging was terrible, arrived loosely packaged with an \\&quot;air pillow\\&quot; packing fillers and the brush was bouncing around loosely in it&#x27;s plastic package inside the box (which is probably the cause of the damage). I consider myself fortunate, since It seems to be poorly made and the knot would have separated from the handle eventually, saving me the cost of repurchasing a new and better quality brush. Returning to Amazon promptly and ordered a:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001XURHAC Colonel Conk Progress Model 247 Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Chrome Handle]]&lt;br /&gt;This is handmade by Vulfix a well know and respected brush maker from the Isle Of Man, it may cost almost 3 times the price, but it is still fairly inexpensive and should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t bother with this shaving brush spend a little more for something that will last.</li>
    <li> Cheap brush to begin with. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of awful reviews of this brush, so I may have been lucky but I&#x27;ve been using mine for more than a year now and it is still working fine. The hair bundle fell out a month ago or so, but I just glued it back. This may have been because I was letting it dry with the hairs up and you&#x27;re supposed to leave it hanging with the hairs pointing downward. 4 stars because it was really cheap to start with and my experience with it has been good.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as a travel brush so that I wouldn&#x27;t risk losing my prized Edwin Jagger silvertip.  Let me just say this, spend the extra money and get something better.  This thing feels like someone is scratching my face, just absolute terrible.  Spend the extra $$$ and buy a decent badger brush.  At the minimum by the cheapest offering from a reputable brand like Edwin Jagger. Skip this thing if you&#x27;d like to take pride in your shaving experience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pokey. Sharp hairs. Compared to the pricier ones, it isn&#x27;t as comfortable to use. Even after a few months. And it still sheds a noticeable amount of hairs while using it.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality brush so far.  Just started using it and never shaved with one of these before.  It lost some hair at first but I think that is to be expected.  Works well and great price.</li>
    <li> This works well. For all those who complain about the hair falling, please try to get rid of as much water after your shave and then place it on a stand, UP-SIDE down. This will get rid of the water and keep the adhesive strong.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as my old badger brush</li>
    <li> Makes shaving so much more enjoyable! It makes things so much more comfortable and makes shaving such a smooth experience. Worth every penny and more of what you will pay for it!</li>
    <li> A very inexpensive brush that creates a great lather!  I highly recommend this...no problems with brush fallout, just hang upside down when finished.</li>
    <li> It does have its shortcomings in that the bristles will fall out more often than I would like.  But for the price, it&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> so, out of the box, this brush looked great. The bristles are full and soft. During the first use, I noticed about 5 or so bristles had come out.  No big deal, but with subsequent use, I still noticed a few bristles coming loose. Not sure how long it will last losing bristles like that. After about the 3rd or 4th use, I noticed the clear coat on the handle was cracked, allowing water to soak into the wood. Pretty quickly the rest of the coating cracked and started coming off. Returned to Amazon. Kudos to Amazon customer service. Quick, free return process. I am not sure if my problem with the finish was isolated, but overall, I&#x27;d say this brush was about right for the price: better than the cheapo Wally world version, and not nearly as nice as the 30$ price point brush.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. nothing bad to say at all. Soft, lathers nicely, comes with a cheap little stand.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of that real long, extensive review that claims the problems with hair loss others are complaining about was due to use.  I followed his advice and the hairs fall out like crazy.  I use a drying stand, I did even before the purchase.  I don&#x27;t use excessive pressure.  The hairs come out as many as 10 or more per use.  The brush is no better or worse than any low-cost brush I have used.  If you buy based on his review, which is very encouraging, then don&#x27;t be surprised if you find the hairs on your face and left behind on the soap.  If you are prepared for this, then it is a decent brush.  It will create a nice lather.</li>
    <li> Mine has had daily use for years and still looks and feels new.  If you don&#x27;t have a shaving brush get one, as a matter of fact, get this one.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is great shaving brush at a very reasonable price. It lost a few bristles the first couple of times I used it, but it&#x27;s been fine ever since. As noted by others, be sure to rinse it well after each use and hang it bristles down to dry.</li>
    <li> This brush has pretty stiff bristles and works great for making a nice lather. At the price it is a good starter brush. My main gripe with this brush is the fact that it constantly looses bristles. My first tub of shave soap is now filled with discarded bristles from this brush. I would end up with bristles on my face while shaving. I stored and maintained this brush the proper way and it still lost bristles constantly. I thought that it may be the way I was treating the brush but I bought a Col Conks brush and use it the same way with no lost bristles. I contacted the manufacturer of this brush and they made it so hard to return it that I just threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> This brush has no spine whatsoever.  When wet, the bristles sag at an almost 90 degree angle to the handle.  After a weeks use, it is headed to the junk bin.  Would not stop shedding bristles, stank to high heaven with &#x27;badger smell&#x27;, even after cleaning it and conditioning it properly.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush lathers soap incredibly well and without fault. In first uses, some hairs may fall out, but after it has been used ten or so times, it will start to work much more efficiently. In order to keep its life continuous, make sure to thoroughly rinse and clean the brush, then hang it to dry on either a post or somewhere where it will drip upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and have had no problems with it since.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m switching to wet shaving for my wedding to get a closer shave. I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s good to start out with a lower end brush, so I purchased the Tweezerman. Just had my first shave and the difference using the brush is unbelievable (still using a disposable razor). Only needed one stroke where sometimes I&#x27;ve needed 2 or 3 applying cream by hand. I cant wait to move towards a safety razor for an even closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to see how the brush holds up over the long term, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and glad I didn&#x27;t start out with something high end. I&#x27;ve read a lot about the smell, and I can honestly see I didn&#x27;t notice any (maybe a little piney but nothing offensive at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend for anyone who wants to venture into wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I have several shaving brushes and i was intrigued by the price of this brush so i bought it. I was very pleased by the feeling of the bristles when this brush was dry and wet when i touched it with my finger tips. Just for kicks i brought out my semogue boar brush to have a comparison the first go around with the tweezerman i did not get a great later so i cleaned it and got rid of the excess of water in it then it produced a so so lather i faced lathered with it got it to the point were i liked it the bristles scratched my face so bad that i got a rash from it and it is continuing to burn 2 hours later. my semogue got a huge amount of lather no problem the first time did not have face lather as long and it was way way softer then the tweezerman. the tweezerman sheds hair like crazy and it was constructed very poorly also the rash is horrible i might be allergic or the grade of badger hair is horrible i would not recommend this product to anyone at all i am not going to bother breaking this in to see how much softer it will get i am returning this product as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush, especially for the price! For a simple, reliable, and affordable shave brush, I definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> One nice shaving brush and very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> great brush for the price, cant go wrong</li>
    <li> Been great while its lasted.. Took only 6 month for all bristels to come off. I suppose you need to store it upside down - I didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as part of an Amazon suggested shaving system for my husband&#x27;s Christmas present. It was one of the best things I have ever bought for him, as he has very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> For the price a great brush....have more expensive brushes but tend to go back to this one due to handling and ease.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year, and it&#x27;s held up very well. I lost a few bristles early on, but not for very long, and I don&#x27;t lose any now. If you&#x27;re worried that this brush is too cheap to last, don&#x27;t be.</li>
    <li> Upon using it for the first time, the brush shed like crazy. I had to use my nails to try to pick out the badger hairs so that I could shave. It made it a lengthy and annoying process. I wish I had purchased this locally rather than on Amazon; I would have headed straight back to the store to return it. (It&#x27;s not worth returning it now because I&#x27;d only get 50% back.) I have kabuki and powder makeup brushes that work better than this.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I&#x27;m not looking forward to my next attempt.</li>
    <li> i just thought id write a review for the first time stateing that ive used a boar brush befor i  had to discard it on febuary fourth i got my tweezerman badger brush  i appsalotly love it id defantly recomend this brush to a friend or co worker for there daily shave this bi all means is holding realy well and at a cheap affordable price  cant beat it with a stick if you even tried this if youve had problems with brush&#x27;s in the past biall means get this brush cant go wrong getting it  will be back after the next month is up to let yall know further updates on how it still holds up</li>
    <li> Cant go wrong with the price of $12, just know that the hairs do and will fall out sooner then later.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know how to compare this to better brushes, but it feels as nice as mine that was three times the price.  It is a gift so time will tell how long it lasts.  The Tweezerman guarantee is nice too.  What a great way to get into traditional soap shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to replace one that I had received in a shaving kit. The older brush fell apart almost instantly and was losing hairs consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting fed up with that brush, I purchased this Tweezerman shaving brush to replace it. What a world of difference! This brush holds up, has only lost a couple hairs total in the time I&#x27;ve owned it, and creates a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Not bad for a budget boar hair brush.  First couple of times you use it you will loose some hairs, but that is to be expected.  Rinse it out thoroughly, and air dry it hanging w/the hairs down and I don&#x27;t see why this would not last someone quite a while.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush and for the price, I think anyone who shaves should have this at least as a travel or back-up brush. For me, this is my primary. Nice bristles, feel good against the skin. Very soft and smooth. The only thing is that it&#x27;s a little small for my hands and so I have to really get it rolling to build a great lather. Have about 10 shaves on it and have seen maybe a grand total of 5-10 bristles in my bowl afterwards. Another reviewer had correctly pointed out that proper brush care is vital to the health of your brush. I was fortunate in that my grandpa taught me wet-shaving when I was about 14 or so and a big part of his lectures was on brush and metal maintenance. Never mash your brush into the bowl, always keep it moving and in the same direction as much as possible, before going in the opposite direction to churn, never dry by flicking, dry it by lightly running the brush in one direction in your palm and then spreading the bristles before you hang it to dry. I have a great stand and this fits perfectly on it. I can see this lasting a few decades.</li>
    <li> Like others I noticed the brush smells bad when wet.  The smell did not make his face smell bad.  The first couple of uses it lost some hair but that has stopped.  This brush is much softer than his boar brush and for the price it is ok.  Not sure I would buy this one again but I might recommend it to a beginner.</li>
    <li> the tweezerman men&#x60;s shaving brush is little and robust.  I&#x27;m working with it for two months ago and I dont have any problem with it.  early some hair fall down, but now is ok, and work fine.</li>
    <li> I find this brush a little stiff.  I use a vintage brush that is so much softer.  I try it once in a while hoping it will soften up.</li>
    <li> My son decided that he wanted to shave like in the old days and loves this brush to mix up the soap.</li>
    <li> good little brush for men who want a starter badger brush. great price. this is an entry level brush for frugal minded men.</li>
    <li> There are plenty of brushes out there and they can be hard to choose from.  At the end of the day, all that matters with a brush is getting a good lather out of your cream and getting it massaged into your face.  This does that pretty well but it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as what I&#x27;ve heard others do.  When I first got it, it tended to shed a lot of hairs but has finally settled down after about 2-3 months of use although it still sheds some here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use this in a mug but have since kept it in the shower and developed a lather on my face with the brush.  So far, it&#x27;s does okay in that regards.  If you&#x27;re like me and trying out a more traditional shave with a safety razor or straight razor, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> I got this shaving brush and the first time I tried to use it I noticed that the bristles felt really loose. As soon as I soaked them in hot water the weight from them being wet separated them from the handle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for the last six months and it loses multiple hairs every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;It started out OK and only lost a few hair each session in the beginning.  I store it hairs down everyday.&lt;br /&gt;It is no longer worth using when you end up with Badger hair on your face.  I going to spend more money on my next brush and hope for higher quality.</li>
    <li> There are much more expensive brushes out there but none a better value than this one.  I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 3 years and have purchased two others as gifts.  This is great for the new or experienced wet shaver or anyone wanting a thick lather.  I use it with Art of Shaving or C.O. Bigelow (proraso) creams.  It works great.  It does not lose very many bristles and any smell coming from the brush will go away quickly.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for two years and it is still going strong. It lathers well and has held up to daily shaving and traveling. I have a stand and it is able to dry out every day, but other than that I don&#x27;t do anything special with it. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It took a while for the loose hairs to all come out so they weren&#x27;t being left in my cream, or on my face.  Seemed like one or two every shave for a while.  It seems like that has stopped now, and it&#x27;s a decent enough brush.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great tool to have. It does much much better than my other one I use when I go away for the military which cost about the same price and I will probably purchase another one of these to replace that one.</li>
    <li> perfect for lathering up to shave.</li>
    <li> Handle falls off due to moisture after many uses. This isn&#x27;t a buy to keep forever type product but it&#x27;s certainly a MUCH cheaper alternative to buying a brush that can cost $50-$100. It feels great for the price.</li>
    <li> It works great, my only issue it loses hair from time to time but not sure you can expect anymore....</li>
    <li> No don&#x27;t like it at all. It is very hard in the skin.</li>
    <li> This brush is decent. It works fine and makes a nice lather. It lost a lot of bristles in the first few uses, and continues to lose a few more every time. For the price you can do much better, but it works.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised of the quality of the product so moderately priced.  Has improved the quality of my shaves.  Only negative comment is that is loses a bristle or two with each shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for 6 or 8 months now and it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best deal for the money - hands down.  You may prefer a different/stiffer brush, but you can&#x27;t beat the price for this quality.</li>
    <li> To be fair I&#x27;m not very experienced, may be they all lose bristles, but it&#x27;s price and functionality makes it a good buy.</li>
    <li> I got this in yesterday and washed the brush in warm soapy water to get the short hairs out that didn&#x27;t get glued into place. The brush performed very well and held a thick lather on the brush. If someone is looking for a good badger brush that is not to expensive and performs well I would recommend this brush. A+</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes cannot be outdone. Sure, they aren&#x27;t as thick or dense as more expensive badger brushes, but they are badger and perform quite well. If you want a good, solid entry level badger brush, you won&#x27;t find another this good for this price.</li>
    <li> This brush shed 30+ hairs the first time I tried to use it, and splayed out nearly 180 degrees, but did not return to its correct shape after use.  I had to switch over to my boar brush to complete my shave.  Altogether a complete disappointment and so it will be returned for refund.  I am still finding hairs in the bathroom hours later.  I recommend that you avoid this product and buy something that works.</li>
    <li> The product does not seem to hold up well.  I have 2 other safety brushes and know how to properly care for them.  They do not seem to shed as this one lost over 15 hairs on the maiden run.  I have my concerns about using it again.</li>
    <li> Have to say you get what you pay for.  There is no way you can buy a $10 brush and have it feel like a $160 one.  This is true here.  It&#x27;s stiff and scratchy and very small.  Handle is made from wood and within a few weeks the varnish soaks off.  But, its cheap.</li>
    <li> Have a lot of the hairs falling out during use not sure if this is normal but I&#x27;m going to try out another brand to see if they all do this.  Does its job though besides the bristles falling out</li>
    <li> A really noticeable difference from my low end boar bristle brush. Pretty soft and at a good price.</li>
    <li> This brush works great.  It&#x27;s so soft (I was using a natural bristle brush before that was super scratchy), and it hasn&#x27;t lost many hairs.  However, BEWARE!  This brush stinks!  It turned my white shaving soap brown, and the smell is so bad I can&#x27;t stand to use it.  I have stopped using it, and began washing it daily, hoping the smell goes away.  I actually use it to shave my legs (I&#x27;m female), so I can&#x27;t imagine what it must be like to have that stench on my face.  It smells like what you&#x27;d expect a dead, wet badger to smell like.  If the smell doesn&#x27;t go away soon, I would not recommend this brush to anyone that has a sense of smell.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this it broke apart from the handle. To clarify I was using this very gently; holding by the end of the bristle. I did manage to put it back, but very unsettling before even getting my first shave with it. After my first run, I had badger hair all over my face and falling out of the brush. Begrudgingly I used it a few more times, with (a little) less badger hair coming out, but had to use it with the absolute utmost care to not fall apart in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m back to using Shave Gel while I wait for an Omega Boar brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, this brush does smell. Like I have a family of raccoon in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Good brush, but it is slowly losing hairs, and the coating on the wood is starting to peal. still, you can expect a few years of use out of this brush, and at this price point, that&#x27;s perfectly adequate.</li>
    <li> Perfect for getting a good lather.  It&#x27;s also fairly inexpensive and feels great on your skin.</li>
    <li> Very soft, drys well, generates a good lather.  Seems to lose a few hairs each day.</li>
    <li> This brush was recommended by a different reviewer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the highest quality. I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times now and a lot of the bristles have come out all over my bathroom and face with very light use.</li>
    <li> I just bought this brush to use when I travel. It is almost identical to a 50 dollar Edwin jagger I also purchased from amazon. I wish I had bought this one first. The only thing it&#x27;s missing is a stand, and a stand is a must. If you whip out your fonzi comb and run it through the brush before you wash it, there will be light if any shedding. If you are considering  buying a more expensive brush try this one out first. You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> I ordered the Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush for my husband&#x27;s birthday, April 2012.  (His first shaving brush.) To make a nice gift I ordered the Omega 172 Chrome Shaving Brush Stand to ensure the shaving brush would dry properly after each use and last a long time.  My husband shaves about once a week, and had no problems until about 2 months worth of use.  The brush sits (in the stand) on the bathroom counter, and while cleaning, I lightly bumped it and the \\&quot;ball\\&quot; of dry bristles fell out of the wooden stand.  The ball of bristles were attached to the stand using some kind of wax.  Anyway my husband used krazy glue to reattach it, and got maybe 2 more uses and it the bristles fell out again.  Each time the brush is used, my husband takes care to thourghly rise the it and place it back in the brush stand to dry.  The ball of bristles were glued with a bit more krazy glue a second time, and thankfully it has not fallen out since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the $12.09 I paid for this brush was a really good deal, and based on all the excellent reviews, I did not expect this sort of thing to happen.  There are however several reviewers stating the bristles fell out, as well as other complaints.  All in all, I would NOT recommend this brush.  I suggest spending a little more money on a better badger brush and not have the hassle of reattaching the bristles to the stand.  OR if you do buy this brush, don&#x27;t expect it to last forever!</li>
    <li> This is a very affordable pure badger bristle brush. It works fine with my shave soap, but it does shed. I lose a few bristles every time I use it, and others have noted the same thing. It&#x27;s great to pick up on the cheap to get into traditional wet shaving without breaking the bank, but I&#x27;m looking into getting a nicer one.</li>
    <li> Not a stiff enough brush for my taste. The bristle flattens out as soon as you start working in the lather and end up working the soap in with the stump of the handle.</li>
    <li> Probably the best sub-10$ brush you&#x27;re going to find.  With that in mind, I&#x27;m definitely going to buy a better brush soon.  It loses hairs constantly and I really dislike the feel of a loose hair on my face.  Doesn&#x27;t get quite the lather and water retention I was hoping for.  The new brush smell isn&#x27;t too bad; just leave it in some soapy water overnight then rinse it.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for about two months.I read the reviews but thought if i did as the instructions read, that it should last. I was wrong. I washed the brush to get the loose hair  out, dry it and lay it on its side as instructions suggest.Even after 2 months it is loosing the hair bristles. Every use three or more hairs fall out. I am going to buy another one , but not this brand.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this brush long, and it&#x27;s not the first brush I&#x27;ve had or used.  It feels so good, and works so well, I&#x27;ve already ordered another for when this one wears out.  Two were less expensive than one of the higher priced brushes, and I can&#x27;t believe the higher cost would have resulted in a better brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it a little differently than normal.  I have highly sensitive skin, and I get razor burn real easy and real bad.  It&#x27;s getting worse the older I get. I used to use an Old Spice mug and brush that I loved.  Wish Old Spice would start making them again. I&#x27;m using the Gillette Fusion Hydro Gel and razor.  It wasn&#x27;t working real well for me.  But with this brush, problem solved.  Now I take the lather and smear some on my face, wet the brush with hot water and work it in.  It not only builds a better lather it feels great and the razor burn is gone again.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with the brush until the bristles separated from the base after only 4 uses.  I had to reglue the two pieces.  Needless to say, I can&#x27;t call that a good experience and would not buy this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  So, after regluing the brush, it lasted a couple more weeks until it came apart again. Its a shame the construction is so poor because its an otherwise nice brush.  I have ordered a Kingsley brush and can only hope I have better luck.</li>
    <li> Other reviews state this brush has some issues, of which I have been lucky not to experience. Like other reviews, I agree if you properly care for the brush you will not run into the reported problems. For the low price tag this is the perfect brush for those inclined to get into a classic shaving style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to pick this brush up from Amazon with the [[ASIN:B002AN5RWQ Edwin Jagger Rn6 Contemporary Chrome Plated Shaving Soap Bowl, Chrome]] and [[ASIN:B00764EF6I Colonel Conk No.176 Acrylic Brush Stand]] as an Amazon add-on item  for under $40, a bargain for a great setup! especially for beginners.</li>
    <li> I have a 15 year old brush that I was replacing with this new brush.  One attempted use convinced me to return this product and continue using my old brush.</li>
    <li> my husband is happy with this</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Makes applying creams and shaving a breeze. Thanks for your great product!! Recommend this brush for first time shavers.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, the price is right, the brush is stored in brush hanger but it still starts falling apart after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> First off, for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. Is if far from perfect? Yes. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a badger out of the box. Its not a terrible smell, but its not exactly something I wanted to smell like. Fortunately, I shave at night when I have time to take some time and enjoy the process so the smell on my face was gone by the morning. If you use it with a scented shave soap the smell will be gone in a week. Mine was gone faster because I practiced whipping up a lather 2-3 times a day for a few days to break the brush in and to get the hang of the technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a week or two to break in. It felt pretty awful on the first use. I soak it for 5-10 minutes before every use (while I shower) and on the first few uses, it felt like the tips of the hairs were stabbing my face. Not pleasant. With about two weeks of use, this has improved greatly and it has become comfortable with that right amount of scrubbing feeling that lets you know the lather is getting around the base of every hair and cleaning all the gunk off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It loses bristles a lot in the first week. One of the reviews said that you shouldn&#x27;t use the handle when whipping up your soap, but with my bowl that I use this is not possible. I&#x27;m not going to caress this cheap brush as if it was my first child, I&#x27;m going to use it like the tool that it is. As long as you dry it with the bristles down on a stand (just buy a stand if you don&#x27;t have one, it functions nice, looks nice and makes your shaving things look like a set) the hairs will stop falling out after about a week and you&#x27;ll be left with a nice brush that should last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Three stars may seem low, but the breaking in process warrants that. Five stars goes to a product that blows my mind and lasts forever. This will not. It is, however, a great value and good for beginners.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I just got into the whole wet shaving thing pretty recently, and I wanted to start off with an inexpensive, decent brush.  Based on the majority of the reviews, this seemed like the brush for me, so I went ahead and got it despite a few misgivings.  Here&#x27;s the problem though, if the good reviewers actually have a good brush, then Tweezerman has a real quality management problem because mine starting falling apart pretty much immediately (and if you do some more research you&#x27;ll find out I&#x27;m far from the only one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...But let&#x27;s start on a positive note.  The brush itself actually does a pretty nice job--especially considering the fact it&#x27;s a $10 brush.  It definitely performs above its price range!  However, I&#x27;ve lost at least 30 hairs out of the thing so far, and that number&#x27;s likely to go up drastically in the fairly near future (see next paragraph for details).  Oh, I take great care of my things, so the hair loss isn&#x27;t coming from any sort of misuse or neglect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the good part...the handle.  First of all, the people at Tweezerman must be mentally retarded making a brush handle out of wood for a piece of equipment that is regularly near and/or submerged in water.  It&#x27;s fairly obvious to anyone with basic common sense that eventually the wood will break down, and most people who have used this brush eventually run into this problem somewhere down the line.  Once again, I fall victim to terrible quality management in that mine began to crack within a week!  Not just tiny little cracks either...I have many cracks in my handle, including a giant freaking crack running down the base and side of my brush.  Don&#x27;t ask me how this even happened because outside of cleaning the brush the handle&#x27;s never even gotten wet or partially submerged for a prolonged period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly feel this brush is such a waste of my time that I&#x27;m not even bothering to return it...I&#x27;m going to use it till it falls apart, then I&#x27;m going to doexactly what I suggest you all do...instead of buying this piece of junk go out and spend $40+ for a nice brush that&#x27;s going to last you a much longer time.  There are plenty of great shaving brushes for all budgets...whether you&#x27;re looking to spend $200+ or $30, so pass this one up and fork over an extra $20 or so if you&#x27;re looking for a budget brush.  Believe me, you will not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accept that I got a poorly made brush, and that there are probably plenty of these brushes that don&#x27;t fall apart in the matter of weeks, but it&#x27;s just too much frustration and annoyance to deal with for $10.  Whether it&#x27;s in a week or two or several years, this brush will fall apart due to poor workmanship and design choices, and I just don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s acceptable regardless of cost.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush based on a good reviews I read here, to replace my old shaving brush that I bought from Wal-Mart for $10. I did not have supper high expectations but expected it to be at least comparable to the one I had. Well… I was disappointed. The bristles on this brush are too short to get a good foam or gel on your face with comfort. Shaving with this brush was very unpleasant experience so I threw it away and got another one that I am finding acceptable from Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I have used this brush daily for 2 months. There are some hairs that fall out here and there but nothing majoe. Holds up well, and I would suggest getting a stand for this brush to hang upside down. That way water won&#x27;t run down and losen the glue holding the hair inside the brush. Brushes will last longer.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush but any good brush goes bad if you don&#x27;t store it correctly. Make sure that you buy a stand to keep your brush upside down when note in use otherwise the brush will go for a toss very soon. I bought &amp;#34;Colonel Conk No.134 Acrylic Brush Stand&amp;#34; along with this brush and both have been working great. The stand is a bit smaller for this brush but I am able to still manage it ok.</li>
    <li> Good first brush.  It did shed some hair for the first two weeks, but not a problem anymore.  Since I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, I don&#x27;t think I can give it a 5 star rating.  I feel like it should be able to hold heat a bit better than it does, but I won&#x27;t bump it down a star because of this (again, first brush, so can&#x27;t compare it to anything else yet).</li>
    <li> This brush is an incredible brush, especially for the price! It rivals the more expensive badger brushes at the price of a boar hair brush.  It is also very durable, doesn&#x27;t shed, and has a lifetime warranty.</li>
    <li> my partner loved it - perfect gift for him to go with all the accessories  . . . .  .</li>
    <li> Bought this brush to test the waters of wet shaving, and it was a good purchase for the price. I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months, and it has mostly stopped shedding (the first two weeks or so it lost several hairs each shave), with only a hair or two lost every other shave. Feels great, don&#x27;t know how to compare it as I have not had a boar or silvertip brush. Plan on keeping this until some excess of money allows me to buy a silvertip from whippeddog.com but this is a good choice for someone who is just getting started</li>
    <li> I have been updating my grooming habits recently using shaving brush, pre-shave oil (organic) and, of course, shaving soap (organic, too).  I updated to this brush from the one in kit sold at my local ****-mart store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right off you feel and see the difference while spreading the shaving soap, cream in my case.  It is NOT messy, but evenly covered.  The bristles are soft on skin.  The old one used to poke me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is my first brush (or second one, actually) I will have to give update based on durability.  I read that these brushes tend to, or may lose their shape.  A brush holder is recommended to maintain their shape;  I am looking for one now.</li>
    <li> New to wet shaving last year and after reading too many reviews, I decided to do my own comparison of shaving  brushes. I purchased this brush and a Van Der Hagen brush in July 2014. The Van Der Hagen brush is stiff and takes a long time to generate a good lather. The Tweezerman brush is soft and generates a lather quickly. I use the Tweezerman brush on a daily basis and keep the Van Der Hagen brush in my travel bag where it gets occasional use.</li>
    <li> New to the DE thing so went lower end on the brush.  For the price it&#x27;s great, had several hairs fall out first use.  Feels good, holds water, and does the job.  I will be upgrading though in the future</li>
    <li> Price cannot be beat on this brush.  This was my second brush purchase and leaps and bounds ahead of the synthetic brush my gf had picked out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it definitely had a badger smell when I first began using it.  After the first 2-3 shaves the brush picked up the smell of my Proraso shaving soap and has not been an issue since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush feels great on the face and lathers extremely well.  Have been using it 3-4 times a week for almost a year and have not had issues with a cracked handle like some others here.  The brush will occasionally lose bristles, will occasionally find a few in my shaving soap but it&#x27;s maybe 2-3 bristles a month so nothing really to worry about given the price of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have bought as a gift for friends starting wet shaving and they&#x27;ve all had similar experiences.  Great first time brush but looking to try a whippeddog.com silvertip in the future since it&#x27;s not much more money and a much nicer brush.</li>
    <li> For the price I was expecting something nasty, but based on reviews I tried it. Wonderful. It&#x27;s not awesome but its very good and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months. Never lost more than a few bristles and I use a brush like a tool in the bowl... I mash and flash. I do  clean and put in a stand which is crucial for brushes IMHO. This is a nice brush whether its a main or travel. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price like I almost was.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the lowest end Walmart shaving brushes before I got this one and it&#x27;s a major improvement. Lathers well and after six months of daily use it still feels like new. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Works ok for the price, but it is kind of prickly. Fine for a starter badger brush.</li>
    <li> This brush was a great way for me to &amp;#34;test the waters&amp;#34; in DE shaving without killing my bank account.  It&#x27;s a *very* budget conscious brush, and yes, it sheds hair occasionally - but for the price, it&#x27;s a great starter brush.</li>
    <li> Great product, have had mine for years and am just writing this review now. It will likely last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality brush, but it was much smaller than I expected it to be.  I went back to using my older brush. Still, a good brush for the money.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like it.  At first, bristles started to come out alarmingly fast.  However, that seems to have stopped.  I guess there were just a few loose ones that were going to come out.</li>
    <li> This was my first brush when I decided to get into safety razor shaving. This brush has worked very well for me. It has always lathered well and other than the first couple shaves,  it does not shed. For the price you can&#x27;t beat this deal. Maybe one day I will purchase a nice looking brush, but as a beginning brush I couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better. I have recommended this brush to other beginner safety razor shavers and they have all loved it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush since Aug. 2012! From using suggestions given by other reviewers this will last.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for over a year so it held up for me.  Some hairs do fall out every time I use it.  I would prob buy again at the price.</li>
