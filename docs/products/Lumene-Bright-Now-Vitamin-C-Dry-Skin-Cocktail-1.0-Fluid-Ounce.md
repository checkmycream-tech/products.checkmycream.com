    <li> Good product for dry winter days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for about 2 weeks so not sure it is doing anhything.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I love the way my skin looks and feels and it is even gentle enough to use in the eye area.</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle and it did nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well, gives skin a dewy look, not greasy. Makeup is easily applied over serum. Positive comments on skin as a result of using this for several weeks.</li>
    <li> like it, it is really working, but my skin is too sensitive to use it everyday.  I have to stop using it when there is a rash on my face.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! It&#x27;s inexpensive and it works. Gives a dewy glow. I have oily skin and I use this every AM instead of traditional moisturizer and my skin looks amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a rip off copy cat - not the real thing. Beware. Lumene has the trademark symbol and calls it&#x27;s product &amp;#34;dry skin comfort radiance cocktail.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m pissed and have been duped.</li>
    <li> I always order this opil. Its lightweight, I cannot find it locally where I live but CVS in other states has it</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  Was recommended by a friend.</li>
    <li> This serum is absolutely amazing! It has drenched my skin with vital hydration and my skin has never looked better. I have repurchased this serum countless times for years and it never fails. Not only does it help with dryness, but it gives my skin a youthful glow and helps with my acne, acne scars/marks, dullness, redness, etc. The Vitamin C is the key ingredient for better looking skin and I love how it has a smooth consistency. It doesn&#x27;t just soak into the skin right away, but all day you feel it giving your skin the nutrients it needs. I will never stop using this holy grail product.</li>
    <li> FABULOUS PRODUCT.  I have gorgeous skin at 73 years of age, mostly due to this Vitamin C skin cocktail.  I use and like all of the Lumene Products.  I have even had ladies who sell Mary Kay products sneak and use my Lumene products.</li>
    <li> Nice product for the money.</li>
    <li> Love it - smells wonderful!!</li>
    <li> This is not only pretty in the bottle, it is glowing on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Lumene departs a dewy glow to my mature skin, with no blotchiness, redness, or itching. I try to hide the bottle from friends as they are fascinated with shaking it &amp; playing with the &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34;. Even more so once they&#x27;ve tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, but hide it somewhere...it works!</li>
    <li> This product expiry date?</li>
