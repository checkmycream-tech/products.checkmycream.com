      <li>We love this product.  </li>
      <li>Excellent facial cleanser to use with or without Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser :)</li>
      <li>I have used this product for about a year or so, therefore I am able to evaluate it based on experience with its use over time.  </li>
      <li>I first tried this cleanser when I received a sample with my Clarisonic Mia, and I absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>cleanser easily distributes over your skin.</li>
      <li>Everyone noticed her skin was getting clearer and looked better quickly.  </li>
      <li>I admit to having good genes, but believe a good cleansing routine is a major foundational key to good skin and Gentle Hydro does the trick for me!</li>
      <li>I am over 50 and using this cleanser along with the Clarisonic Mia has made a huge difference in my skin tone and texture.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was just the Clarisonic Skin Care System that was solely responsible for the my skin looking so good, and for it feeling so silky.</li>
      <li>I tried using alternate brands with my Clarisonic brush but found that this Gentle Hydro Cleanser seems to work the best -- relatively mild and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
      <li>Its really rich and creamy and</li>
      <li>It works, but is a bit greasy feeling compared to the original cleanser.</li>
      <li>Continue to use on clean and renew skin on face.</li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re done with the Pro System, all you have to do is splash water on your face afterwards and you feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I appreciate this cleanser as something simple to use on my extremely sensitive acne-prone skin to do what it does best</li>
      <li>The product above is the best product that they make for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My favorite by far.  </li>
      <li>It has a soft cucumber scent that I find refreshing.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels so fresh when using it</li>
      <li>All very positive.</li>
      <li>I wish that skin care companies get the message that we as consumers do not want fragrance chemicals in our skin care products unless it comes from the natural state like an essential oil which can be good &amp; not bad for your skin.</li>
      <li>This cleanser gave my oily/acne prone skin just that right amount of balance.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it for the removal of make-up, so I can&#x27;t review that, but as far as a first thing in the morning rinse, it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>This is good because I use less.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also is very gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>There is no smell and it is very gentle.</li>
      <li>This cleanser does a thorough yet very gentle job.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for offering a quality product!  </li>
      <li>most recently ordered it in August 2012 and found they changed the packaging and formula.</li>
      <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect from clarisonic.</li>
      <li>When I first got my Clarisonic Pro Skin Care System, I got the cleansers and all 3 brushes that came with it.</li>
      <li>I love my Clarisonic though and use it with my regular face wash.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
      <li>Great for dry sensitive mature skin.</li>
      <li>Got my first tube at Nordstrom&#x27;s for twice the price Amazon sells it for - thank you for being so reasonably priced -</li>
      <li>and I have had super clear and non-itchy or irritated skin.  </li>
      <li>so hopefully it will last a good, long while.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s right about this one (which is something I am discovering holds true for a variety of topics outside of here, to be quite frank.</li>
      <li>The cleanser is gentle and the brush makes my face feel vibrant!</li>
      <li>Cleanser is gentle and really cleans the skin.</li>
      <li>I bought this gentle cleanser for her.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>am still keeping the review positive because after using it for three days (twice daily) my skin has not broken out; the product is still not drying and rinses cleanly.</li>
      <li>I cannot live without this!  </li>
      <li>My mom got me the Clarisonic facial brush for Christmas last year, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin super clean but without that dried out feeling.</li>
      <li>I am an \\&quot;older\\&quot; person and have sensitive skin and this along with the brush really did work.</li>
      <li>Her skin is sensitive and this cleanser works very well for her.</li>
      <li>But it is also now very fragrant, which concerns me with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>No matter how many different types of washes, soaps, scrubbers, etc., I have used, my skin somehow always managed to eventually become dry and irritated.</li>
      <li>If you are expecting a cleanser to use on your face that will rinse off and reveal a brand new person, you won&#x27;t be finding that here or anywhere else for that matter.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>Sure, in the wintertime, one or two parts around my nose will get a little dry during the day, but it just blows my mind how this stuff delivers consistently despite my fickle skin-type.</li>
      <li>I thought this cleanser was just fine, but when I was done, I tried my own, very expensive</li>
      <li>I use this twice daily with my full size clarisonic and it has done miracles for my hormone related acne.  </li>
      <li>and I have quite a sensitive acne prone skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gonna use this for a couple of weeks and see if it will keep me from getting old and wrinkly.</li>
      <li>but I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t require much cleanser, either, so a bottle will last quite a while.</li>
      <li>My skin was finally so irritated from the products I was using, that I decided to just go gentle.  </li>
      <li>I am an adult in his 30+..</li>
      <li>It is the first non-lathering cleanser that felt like it washed off cleanly and didn&#x27;t leave any oil or film behind.</li>
      <li>Also it did not dry my skin at all and did not break my sensitive skin out.</li>
      <li>arrived as expected, couldn&#x27;t really find it anywhere else any cheaper.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought it felt too slight and and that it wasn&#x27;t absorbent enough.</li>
      <li>The first few times I applied this</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sadly, I think Clarisonic changed the ingredients of their sensitive skin wash a few months ago, so now this particular product can only be bought online and in rare instances in stores like Sephora where they may have a few left in stock.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a scent to it, and there is a slight lather.</li>
      <li>I have been using the gentle hydro cleanser for a year and a half with my Clarisonic system.</li>
      <li>This is pretty expensive, but in my book it&#x27;s totally worth</li>

<li> /&gt;Lastly, this cleanser lasts a long, long time.</li>
<li> Not overdrying and lasts a long time.</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
<li> I usually use too much, and it still lasts me for about a month and a half.  </li>
<li> Although its expensive but worth it.</li>
<li> I use it every morning, every other morning with the Clarisonic Mia.</li>
<li> I went with other cleansers like Olay 7-1 all effect cleanser but returned on this.  </li>
<li> Anyway, using such a small droplet means this should last you at least 3-4 months before it starts to empty</li>
<li> It&#x27;s never let me down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter and I share the clarisonic mia pro facial system. I bought this gentle cleanser for her. Her skin is sensitive and this cleanser works very well for her.</li>
    <li> I have oily/acne prone skin and this cleanser has worked miracles! This cleanser gave my oily/acne prone skin just that right amount of balance.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product but I have sensitive skin and it made me break out.  I love my Clarisonic though and use it with my regular face wash.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  I use this twice daily with my full size clarisonic and it has done miracles for my hormone related acne.  My hormones went crazy 8 months ago and I had the worst acne I had ever had and nothing was working.  I went to get facials and even a Vi Peel.  My skin was finally so irritated from the products I was using, that I decided to just go gentle.  So, I started using this cleanser with the brush twice daily along with the DDF moisturizing dew and once my skin normalized I started dabbing 4% sulfur murad calrifying mask on my pimples or possible emerging pimples at night and I have had super clear and non-itchy or irritated skin.  I cannot live without this!  I only wish I didn&#x27;t have acne scarring from when my acne was so bad - but with time, hopefully those will fade.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the clarisonic and this cleanser.  My skin has improved and looks healthier.  I am not one to buy lots of skin products, but this one I&#x27;m sticking with.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me the Clarisonic face brush as a gift and it came with this cleanser. I loved both of them! I am an \\&quot;older\\&quot; person and have sensitive skin and this along with the brush really did work. The cleanser is gentle and the brush makes my face feel vibrant!</li>
    <li> I am an adult in his 30+..and I have quite a sensitive acne prone skin.  After a lot of research I finally went with this combo.   Works like nothing for me. I went with other cleansers like Olay 7-1 all effect cleanser but returned on this.  Cleanser is gentle and really cleans the skin. Although its expensive but worth it. My thumbs up to clarisonic guys to come up with this product.</li>
    <li> My mom got me the Clarisonic facial brush for Christmas last year, and I love it.  I bought this cleanser as a replacement for the one the brush came with.  It&#x27;s never let me down.</li>
    <li> Works well with Clarisonic brush cleaners. Great to receive cleanser easy to order. Continue to use on clean and renew skin on face.</li>
    <li> When I first got my Clarisonic Pro Skin Care System, I got the cleansers and all 3 brushes that came with it. I thought this cleanser was just fine, but when I was done, I tried my own, very expensive cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days, I went back and ordered another one of these Gentle Hydro Cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some reasons why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser easily distributes over your skin. At first I thought it felt too slight and and that it wasn&#x27;t absorbent enough. But I was wrong - it&#x27;s the perfect cleanser to use with the system, and thoroughly cleans your face without leaving a soapy feel. When you&#x27;re done with the Pro System, all you have to do is splash water on your face afterwards and you feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also is very gentle on the skin. At first I thought it was just the Clarisonic Skin Care System that was solely responsible for the my skin looking so good, and for it feeling so silky. But I now realize it&#x27;s a combination of the two. I have had no break-outs since I&#x27;ve used this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this cleanser lasts a long, long time. You only need a pea-sized drop to spread over your face and neck.  One 6-ounce tube lasts me for *months.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended,  for use with the Clarisonic Pro.</li>
    <li> Bought this and the Clarisonic for my daughter.  Everyone noticed her skin was getting clearer and looked better quickly.  We are both sold on this!</li>
    <li> I tried using alternate brands with my Clarisonic brush but found that this Gentle Hydro Cleanser seems to work the best -- relatively mild and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. The brush doesn&#x27;t require much cleanser, either, so a bottle will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> If you are expecting a cleanser to use on your face that will rinse off and reveal a brand new person, you won&#x27;t be finding that here or anywhere else for that matter. I appreciate this cleanser as something simple to use on my extremely sensitive acne-prone skin to do what it does best: cleanse. I use it every morning, every other morning with the Clarisonic Mia. It isn&#x27;t too drying, too heavily scented and rinses well. I haven&#x27;t tried it for the removal of make-up, so I can&#x27;t review that, but as far as a first thing in the morning rinse, it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> this product is good, leaves your face feeling clean, and it leaves a nice smell, I guess its working, would buy it again</li>
    <li> When washing or cleaning my skin I like to feel like a soapy or sudsy feeling of cleansing. This product just went onto my face like a thin filmy substance. Not my favorite.</li>
    <li> No matter how many different types of washes, soaps, scrubbers, etc., I have used, my skin somehow always managed to eventually become dry and irritated. That&#x27;s all changed now with this product. Sure, in the wintertime, one or two parts around my nose will get a little dry during the day, but it just blows my mind how this stuff delivers consistently despite my fickle skin-type. This is pretty expensive, but in my book it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be helpful to know that I am a guy, and I do not have a Clarisonic (but my wife does). I simply put about a dime or nickel-sized drop in my hand and rub it on both my face and neck. The first few times I applied this I thought it wasn&#x27;t enough. However, my wife assured me it simply applies thinly. She&#x27;s right about this one (which is something I am discovering holds true for a variety of topics outside of here, to be quite frank. I digress.). Anyway, using such a small droplet means this should last you at least 3-4 months before it starts to empty out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I think Clarisonic changed the ingredients of their sensitive skin wash a few months ago, so now this particular product can only be bought online and in rare instances in stores like Sephora where they may have a few left in stock. So if you do decide to use this stuff, you may want to stock up! You won&#x27;t be sorry if you do.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out I use it twice a day with the clarsonic cleansing brush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gonna use this for a couple of weeks and see if it will keep me from getting old and wrinkly.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect from clarisonic. Very happy.</li>
    <li> My face loves it and so do I. This is the only product I use to cleanse my skin. I use it in the evening along with my Clarisonic brush.  I just rinse with warm water in the morning to refresh my skin and remove serums and moisturizers from the night before. I am a make-up minimalist and can&#x27;t remember the last time I used foundation, but at 65 I find people often think I am up to 20 years younger even though I have had no &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; or injections. I admit to having good genes, but believe a good cleansing routine is a major foundational key to good skin and Gentle Hydro does the trick for me!</li>
    <li> Great for dry sensitive mature skin.Leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.I am over 50 and using this cleanser along with the Clarisonic Mia has made a huge difference in my skin tone and texture.I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite by far.  Got my first tube at Nordstrom&#x27;s for twice the price Amazon sells it for - thank you for being so reasonably priced - I love this cleanser :)</li>
    <li> Excellent facial cleanser to use with or without Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> We love this product.  arrived as expected, couldn&#x27;t really find it anywhere else any cheaper.  it is a bit pricey product.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.  It is a wonderful cleanser for your face.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I really like it. My skin feels so fresh when using it and I alos like the smell. I use it twice a day and it works.</li>
    <li> I rate this a five as my face broke out with blemishes from an Avon cleanser and it took me awhile to figure out what was causing this acne attack.  I started using this cleanser with the clarisonic and in 2 days it cleared up all that acne.  KUDOs to clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have sensitive skin! I had been using the Foaming Gel Cleanser and like it a lot! But I decided to give this one a try! OMG!!! It is heavenly!! I love the way it makes my skin feel,and it smells WONDERFUL!!! WORKS PERFECT WITH MY CLARISONIC!</li>
    <li> I first tried this cleanser when I received a sample with my Clarisonic Mia, and I absolutely love it!  Its really rich and creamy and my skin feels so good after washing it that I almost don&#x27;t need moisturizer.  Its a tad expensive, but a little goes a long way.  I usually use too much, and it still lasts me for about a month and a half.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The cleanser works wonderfully. There is no smell and it is very gentle. It leaves my skin super clean but without that dried out feeling. I have noticed fewer breakouts too.&lt;br /&gt; I do think it is a bit pricey but you only have to use a dab (about the size of a nickle), so hopefully it will last a good, long while.</li>
    <li> Works well with the clarisonic. Not overdrying and lasts a long time. There isn&#x27;t much of a scent to it, and there is a slight lather.</li>
    <li> This was an Xmas gift for my daughter.  She loves it and uses it all the time.  It was great for the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using the gentle hydro cleanser for a year and a half with my Clarisonic system. It is the first non-lathering cleanser that felt like it washed off cleanly and didn&#x27;t leave any oil or film behind. Also it did not dry my skin at all and did not break my sensitive skin out. All very positive. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most recently ordered it in August 2012 and found they changed the packaging and formula. The cleanser is now thicker and creamier. This is good because I use less. But it is also now very fragrant, which concerns me with my sensitive skin. Also while using it I feel a bit of a tingle I never felt before (also a concern with my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still keeping the review positive because after using it for three days (twice daily) my skin has not broken out; the product is still not drying and rinses cleanly. But if you have been using it for a while, be prepared for a change.</li>
    <li> I use my clarisonic on face almost every night. The product above is the best product that they make for sensitive skin. I also tried the other product that they sell which is a gel &amp; is a little strong on the fragrance &amp; a little drying, so I do not recommend te other product which is a blue tube.&lt;br /&gt;  This product adds moisture, but also has a little fragrance too. I wish that skin care companies get the message that we as consumers do not want fragrance chemicals in our skin care products unless it comes from the natural state like an essential oil which can be good &amp; not bad for your skin.</li>
    <li> I like this for use with my clairsonic brush. It is gentler than the gel cleanser that came as a sample.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I wanted to find a replacement for the discontinued cleanser.  It works, but is a bit greasy feeling compared to the original cleanser.</li>
    <li> This cleanser does a thorough yet very gentle job.  It calms my skin if it is irritated!  It has a soft cucumber scent that I find refreshing.  I will buy this product again!  I have used this product for about a year or so, therefore I am able to evaluate it based on experience with its use over time.  I&#x27;m very pleased!  Thanks for offering a quality product!  Would like to find it on Amazon in a &amp;#34;supersize&amp;#34; amount of say 32ozs.</li>
