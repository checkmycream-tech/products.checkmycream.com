<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> We&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks and the hourglass inside has already popped out.</li>
    <li> Took a while to arrive but I love it!</li>
    <li> Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can smell the metal.</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful time turner necklace straight from the Harry Potter books! However, it came after almost a month, instead of one-two weeks. Also, the clasp was missing and I had to attach one of my own. All in all, I am pleased with the necklace, but there are some things I would watch out for... Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Item is exactly what I wanted! Only down side is that the hourglass with sand broke in shipping.</li>
    <li> Great! Just as I expected and wanted. Bold, sturdy, not cheap plastic and pretty!</li>
    <li> Sand piece fell out first time wearing</li>
    <li> Much better quality than I expected. Great for the price. It even has sand in it!</li>
    <li> This was great. My daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> The sand gous down too fast. Other then that is good and cute.</li>
    <li> Arrived today, for days early. I bought two in case one was broken (and it was but was easy to fix.) My niece LOVES the necklace. Not bad at all for the price.</li>
    <li> great wearing it RIGHT NOW LOVE ITcame so early</li>
    <li> It looks just like the ones i saw them selling in harry potter world in universal, orlando</li>
    <li> granddaughters loved them.  good prices.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Does not actually manipulate time.</li>
    <li> this pendant is beautiful!!!! the only problem I have is that it tarnishes on the back where I the clasp is. other than that , it is outstanding!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;constance west  north carolina</li>
    <li> My sister was not expecting it to be big so that would be why she would not give it 5 stars. All in all she loves it and has not got broken.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I wanted as a gift for my daughter she loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected</li>
    <li> Way better than I thought it was going to be. Its nearly perfect other have that hard metal smell.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!! The only problem is that some of the writing is worn off, but it is beautiful and looks just like the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;!!   (Do not wear anywhere where it might get wet, the chlorine will discolor it.)</li>
    <li> Great item for the price! I was surprised that the middle pieces spin so well. I love to wear this, &amp; it&#x27;s fun to play with when you&#x27;re bored. Would recommend it for any Harry Potter fan.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I wanted it for! The sand even moves! YES, it&#x27;s cheaply made. It&#x27;s not meant to be real gold, lol! BUT It&#x27;s fun and entertaining. I love that it moves around like the time turner from the movies (with that kid with the scar on his head and magic wands and stuff...)  ;) LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is really NOT JUNK. for the price it&#x27;s great! HEY that dont mean raise the cost. LOL It&#x27;s more gold than golden though. STILL it makes a really cool rear view mirror decoration.</li>
    <li> Heavy, well made piece. Arrived in 2 weeks. Only downfall after a week of wearing it the chain began to get black where it touches my skin. I only wore it to work and took it off when I got home, didn&#x27;t get it wet or anything.</li>
    <li> The plastic hour glass sand timer popped out the day I got it in the mail. I was so disappointed. I was going to wear it to a comic con. I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Awful. I ordered this and the best part of it was how fast it came. But when I opened the package, the chain was in broken into 3 pieces. I definatly wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Crappy, crazy for ordering 2.</li>
    <li> When i got it hourglass Was out of it i had to fix it</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for five dollars, but this necklace is beautiful! The parts rotate smoothly, all of the writing is legible, it feels solid, and the gold is so shiny. Not only that but it arrived a week earlier than it was supposed to. Overall I&#x27;m very glad I bought this rather than any other time turner necklaces I had been considering.</li>
    <li> Really great quality for such a great price! The knobs don&#x27;t turn, but it really does spin. Very very nice!! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love it  the nevklace is very pretty</li>
    <li> Well, what did you expect to get for five dollars? I ordered on January 3rd and it arrived earlier than it was expected (It was expected 27th January - Feb 3rd, but came today, January 23rd). I couldn&#x27;t track it, so I kind of ordered it and forgot about it. I&#x27;ve been a HUGE Harry Potter fan, since I was in elementary school, fifteen or so years ago. It&#x27;s obviously not that great of a material. Parts of the engraved writing are illegible. You can see the clear glue on the back, where the hourglass is :( Other than that, I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with it, but I definitely don&#x27;t hate it. It&#x27;s basically okay for 5 bucks. If you want something better, I suggest you don&#x27;t buy something for five dollars!!!</li>
    <li> Its nice kinda cheaply made. It wasn&#x27;t a perfect circle it was kinda lumpy. I still like it. Better than paying $50 for a real one</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Always get comments! Wearing it now ;)</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING IS PERFECT</li>
    <li> Would buy this over and over again! Lovely gift for a harry potter fan or for yourself ;)</li>
    <li> Arrived late but it made my wife smile. Made from cheap material but still cool</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Harry Potter loving kid on a whim. It took a while to arrive, but that was okay - I didn&#x27;t order it for any particular reason other than that it was inexpensive and looked neat. Neat doesn&#x27;t really describe how amazing this necklace is. It spins like a gyroscope. The sand in the hourglass is sparkly (yes - SPARKLY). The outer rim of each circle is engraved (or pressed) with the same words from the books. The clasp isn&#x27;t some cheap little thing either - it&#x27;s the type with a T-bar on one end of the chain and a circle on the other. Really great. The necklace has a good weight to it and feels solid. My daughter loves this.</li>
    <li> Soo cool. Looks just like the movie one! A must have for any Harry Potter fan!</li>
    <li> It is made very cheaply. I have only worn it a couple times for fear that it will break. The sand doesnt actually move properly in the hourglass because the center is too wode so it falls from one side to the other. The words on the pendant are written in improper english, and it is not a shiny gold but instead looks dirty. The knobs on the side do not turn.</li>
    <li> Was really disappointed.  It changed color after a week and the hour glass broke off. Sorry i bought this.  my daughter loved it when i gave it to her.  But was very disappointed after it broke.</li>
    <li> This is really great for the price!  Delivery did not take as long as expected. Overall this is an awesome value for the price paid. Great for a kid.  If you are looking for a very polished detailed piece of jewelry you will need to spend more.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my friend and she absolutely loves it.  It definitely feels like cheap metal, but it still looks absolutely beautiful.</li>
    <li> It arrived completely destroyed. I can not use it.</li>
    <li> little big, cheaply made, but looks cool</li>
    <li> Such good quality!! Much better than getting the &#x27;collectible&#x27; one for people like me that want one for fun! Made of metal, spins well, sand moves, inscription is easy to read! A+ review from me! So excited to show friends!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and if you love Harry Potter, you&#x27;ll feel magical just wearing it c:</li>
    <li> I was not actually expecting it to be this well. Honestly, I thought it would be plastic or some material, but it&#x27;s actual metal. It works amazingly and when I wear it to school I spin it all during class. It&#x27;s way better quality than I would expect for how cheap I got it. It&#x27;s amazing truly, and a plus is that I got it way before the estimated date.</li>
    <li> This thing was amazing, it wasn&#x27;t broken when I got it in the mail. It spins good just like the movie. And In the hourglass thingie part, it&#x27;s actual sand that moves too. So worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love it for the price but they could have at least made it spin that&#x27;s probably unconsciously I was looking forward to the most so I was disappointed by that, other than that for the price it was nice, but as for imperfections I have a few, the little hourglass is VERY unevenly glued in, as for the glue it is sloppy and unsightly , when I say uneven I mean the way it was placed one side sticks out way more than the other and its almost touching the side,</li>
    <li> I feel like the chain should be a lot longer. It makes a nice rear-view mirror dangle.</li>
    <li> Its amazing. I thought it would be really really cheap, but is sooo cool, if you want to buy it, do it</li>
    <li> I wore it one time and the hour glass fell out. I love the necklace because of the movie so I fix it somehow, but not impressed with the quality.</li>
    <li> It was a bit larger than I expected but cute.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very beautiful, there is a nice poem engraved along the gyros.</li>
    <li> Not damaged came in titly wrapped package in an envelope in bubble wrap so it was pretty much protected.&lt;br /&gt;The item itself looks splendid and of course there are no other errors which were mentioned by people in the reviews as  visible glue or sand dropping out of the glass or stuck rotational metals.. everything is good and ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Arrived in the time frame stated by the seller, great present for Harry Potter fans. I sent it to my friend in another state who loved it. Its surprisingly better quality that you would think at the price listed!</li>
    <li> I loved this but it&#x27;s fallen apart 3 times on me so it&#x27;s great if you just never touch it.</li>
