<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> socks were two small-- at least two sizes less than listed. the quality was not very good. definately were not what i ordered.</li>
    <li> For the price I decided to buy them, I am a doctor and often are all day standing and feel my legs tired after a long day. I have used other brands and expecten a little more pressure on the socks. These hardly compress my legs and the fabric feels wierd when I walk in them. Would not buy them again.</li>
    <li> on this order i recieved what i ordered. very good</li>
    <li> Does what they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> Gift to Mom who states they help a great deal.</li>
    <li> Thinner then I expected with less firm compression, but is okay for the price</li>
    <li> Very good support and seem more durable than some of the other brands.</li>
    <li> love them  i have circulation issues on my legs and at the end of my work day i am usually very tired but with they work great on my legs and make my day better</li>
    <li> Will not reorder. These socks are like a &amp;#34; second skin &amp;#34; and actually cut off circulation to my feet.</li>
    <li> Ordered four pair of these socks they are comfortable and stay up as of now but you know how socks stretch out but so far I sm very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Do the job admirably but hard to see them as a &amp;#34;fashion miracle.&amp;#34;  They just look like regular knee-high socks, which is what you want with compression footwear.  Not cheap, but about average for this kind of footwear.</li>
    <li> These socks are so comfortable. I bought them because these socks stay in place and don&#x27;t fall down. THEY ARE AMAZING.</li>
    <li> These socks are really comfortable. They fit any type of shoe and feel cool.  Long wearing and practical.  Great Value!</li>
    <li> These are great support stockings.  My legs feel so much better .</li>
    <li> Nice socks, but they do run. Not as soft and I would like.</li>
    <li> I brought a pair because one of my feet stayed swollen after walking so after wearing them I got hooked, they work great keep swelling down and minor discomfort or aches in leggs</li>
    <li> Sooo much better than paying $20 a pair!  They give very good support.</li>
    <li> These compression socks are Great! They were very in expensive. I recommend them to everyone who retains fluid in the ankles and feet.</li>
    <li> Ordered XL &amp; were SO tight I couldn&#x27;t get pulled past my ankle. Weigh TOO tight!!!</li>
    <li> The miracle socks are worth the price paid.  They are narrow as indicated by another reviewer, but if the socks are put on first thing in the morning, it is much easier.  The socks have a mild compression, are very comfortable, and do stay in place all day long. The socks are relatively easy to take off at night.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I gave them 5 stars because they work very well I would definitely get some more.</li>
    <li> Socks ,very narrow,takes time to put in&lt;br /&gt;When you in a rush, it&#x27;s no good&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise ok</li>
    <li> Great for stimulation in leg when cold outside</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, great end result - I feel less tired at the end of each working day.</li>
    <li> The socks did just what I wanted. It helped to reduce swelling of my ankles and gave me good support because I am a hairdresser.</li>
    <li> very comfortable and keeps my leg swelling down!</li>
    <li> They were good but the material they used was thin and not thick enough. Rips easily</li>
    <li> I could not believe how good these compression socks were for the money.  I have been paying $10 for some that are only half as good and they were the best ones that I could find for the least amount of money.  As one of the reviews said &amp;#34;that they stayed up...TRUE!  And Comfortable TRUE!&amp;#34;  I received a survey from Amazon on this supplier and received the socks the same day.  I tried them on and wore them all day/night.  What a great comparison since I had been wearing my other $10 ones all week due to my edema.  I then answered their survey as being a good buy for the money but was shocked that it was taking so long.  I then received a very nice email from Mokingtop explaining the delay since they come from China and the mail has to go through tough laws.  I must say, that was the first package I ever received from China direct.  All I can say, well worth the wait.  Order some if you do not believe me.&lt;br /&gt;FAT ANKLES/Legs Lady</li>
    <li> So far I worn them three times I like them they do help out I will buy another because I am getting tired of washing them out lol.</li>
    <li> These were supossed to be extra large. They were so small that they were useless.</li>
    <li> At first I thought these socks were too tight, and I requested a return label, but after wearing them for a day I changed my mind. They provide even and firm support. I&#x27;ll order more at his great price.</li>
    <li> So far these socks are fitting very well. I will let you know after some washes...</li>
    <li> Love the socks fits great washes up nice . Was worried after I washed and dried them they would not fit was wrong the same fit.</li>
    <li> Love this socks.  It really compressed the calfs.  We wore this as we took 18 flights of stairs and our calfs were not in pain like we would without it.</li>
    <li> I had a pair already I bought in a store. I loved them and wanted more since I&#x27;m on my feet all day. These are just like the pair I already have. Well made, especially for the price and keep my feet from killing me after standing for hours on end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I have since purchased even more of these from this seller for myself and my boyfriend. We both love them. He wears regular socks over these to fill up more room in his shoes. Every time I&#x27;ve been thrilled with my purchase. I will definitely be buying more of these in the future!</li>
    <li> I really thought I would never receive it after waiting for a month. But it suddenly showed up in my mailbox today and after trying it on, I am surprise by its high quality and high compression! I like it very much! I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> The socks are ok. I did wear them and they made my feet numb.</li>
    <li> Socks fit WAAAAy tighter than I was comfortable with. I get that they are &amp;#34;compression&amp;#34; socks, but honestly after an hour my feet were falling asleep, had to take them off. Didn&#x27;t bother returning them because I was recovering from a surgery (hence wanting the socks for circulation while I stay off my feet). I have small women&#x27;s feet by the way (size 6 1/2) but still no good.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, and took 2 weeks to arrive from China.  Sure can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> These socks feel like regular long socks that you could buy out of any department store. There do not feel like compression socks at all. They don&#x27;t even work. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the New Fashion Miracle Socks, very reasonably priced, will definitely make use of them, thanks!</li>
    <li> Developed shin splints from treadmill - advised to use compression socks. Great socks - but took a couple of weeks for delivery.</li>
    <li> I was told several times to get compression socks. As a large male I hard a hard time trying to figure out what to get. These, are so inexpensive and are shipped from China so it took almost a month to arrive. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. They looked so tiny I wasn&#x27;t sure I get the correct size but they stretch and fit well. I just wish they were an inch or 2 longer because I can pull them up to my calf but they are just a little short to get over my calf. They need to get over the calf to stay up all day. I end up having to check them from time to time to make sure they don&#x27;t ride down and end up strangling my mid calf. Really I&#x27;m only 5&amp;#34; 11&amp;#34; and just an inch or 2 would make them great and comfortable. Also, FYI if you were told to get compression socks, make sure to get them. I find they are not only for my health but I can walk more and feel like I even have more energy. Probably because my legs don&#x27;t get so tired and achy as they use too.</li>
    <li> Make my legs feel great.  I wear them when traveling on air planes to reduce swelling and help with circulation.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. It took a long time to delivery.</li>
    <li> I hate taking away money from American workers, but I also hate my money being taken away from me. They want $15 to $20 for these in stores, but these work like a charm for pennies.</li>
    <li> So far, the socks fit well, stay up all day and really do help keep down the swelling in my legs.  I asked my doctor if they would help me.  He said that they would but, some people cannot tolerate the snugness on their legs.  However, these are very comfortable for me.  If they launder well, I&#x27;l order more.</li>
    <li> these socks are very comfortable and stay up as well as give good compression to your legs. would buy more of these.</li>
    <li> Great for people who are on thier feet all day. reduces leg fatigue and swelling and gives great support.</li>
    <li> Socks worked great while worn all day in the chef&#x27;s kitchen. Better than a mat and will definitely be getting more.</li>
    <li> I got these socks to wear as I work out to promote proper circulation and prevent different trypes of vascular issues in the legs. These socks work and feel great and can be worn with anything.</li>
    <li> Too tight even for compression stockings</li>
    <li> I bought several brands of compression socks to help with swollen feet at the end of my pregnancy. These were the best by far! I wear a women&#x27;s size 6-7 shoe normally which is a men&#x27;s 4-5. My feet were swelling to a size 8-9 in women&#x27;s. These socks kept the blood flow going and fluid out of my feet even after being on my feet all day long and taking several mile long walks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with one reviewer that it takes a minute to put these on but that&#x27;s standard with all compression socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend these to anyone that has to be on his or her feet all day. I&#x27;m planning on using these even after my pregnancy to help with blood flow.</li>
    <li> Theyre good but if someone with thick legs wears them thet loose their shape.</li>
    <li> The socks are OK, a little on the short side for the foot.  Mind you I am only 5&#x27;9 with a size 9.5 foot.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. It provides very good compression and stay up above the calf all day.</li>
    <li> keep my feet a lot warmer than expected but fit great and my feet aren&#x27;t as sore at the end of my shift, i work 12 hour shifts as an RN on a medical-surgical floor</li>
    <li> I look @ the  sock white but I got black plus they feel  funny on your leg&#x27;s , never order again</li>
    <li> Started to come unraveled after 1 or two washington on the gentle cycle.</li>
    <li> love love love the toe room do they come in other colors</li>
    <li> Too tiny.  Waited weeks... didn&#x27;t realize they came from afar.</li>
