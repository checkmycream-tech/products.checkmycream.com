### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Yes to Cucumbers is THE BEST shampoo to both smooth/nourish while simultaneously keep from stripping the color from my hair.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s a win win win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this is good for colored hair.</li>
      <li>If the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather - and get a good lather, at that - it doesn&#x27;t wash out.  </li>
      <li>It smells great and made my hair feel nice.</li>
      <li>but it is a good one to try because it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
      <li>It smells good and I will probably buy it again, but it foams so it must have some form of sulfate in it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very healthy for my hair.</li>
      <li>Great smell &amp; I love that it has no harmful chemicals</li>
      <li>Just what I ordered this is my favorite Shampoo of all time!</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m kind of paranoid</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo but when I received it the bottle wasn&#x27;t even full!!</li>
      <li>Sulfates are the lathering component of most shampoos.</li>
      <li>I love the YES TO products, but this one was a miss.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of cucumbers.</li>
      <li>I have decided to switch to another product after using Yes to Cucumbers for  many years.</li>
      <li>This line has great ratings on the EWG Skin Deep Database and has a good price tag as well.  </li>
      <li>The new version works great though.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it is sulfate free which makes it safe to use with colored hair.</li>
      <li>I have been using the natural walgreens brand Ology cucumber shampoo &amp; I like that one much better, lathers much better &amp; smells almost as good.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the original formula was much better.  </li>
      <li>and it is sooo easy to brush with this shampoo plus the conditioner.</li>
      <li>However, this shampoo is refreshing yet mild.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, this shampoo makes my hair soft, and seems to do a good job of preserving my color.  </li>
      <li>The older product was much better!</li>
      <li>I was surprised that it lathers better than most sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>The new product is just ok and is not as good a value, so I&#x27;ll be shopping around for something new.</li>
      <li>Yes to Cucumbers is the best out of the bunch at least for me</li>
      <li>It was much thicker, had a nicer fragrance, and performed better.</li>
      <li>Gently cleans and protects my fine, color-treated hair.</li>
      <li>Paid full price for 3/4 of a bottle, very dissatisfied!</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and has a  fresh and bright cucumber scent.  </li>
      <li>I am very &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;/eco conscious and strive to find personal care products that are chemical free but also a good value.</li>
      <li>I go thru it sooo fast!</li>
      <li>I am going back to Target to buy the Color Protection line there, as I can&#x27;t be sure the product I wanted and ordered will be the one I get.</li>
      <li>And believe me, that&#x27;s a first.</li>
      <li>shampoos are what I turn to in order to repair damage, but smoothing means oil, and oil pulls color out pretty viciously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus for this product is that there are NO SULFATES.</li>
      <li>I like the idea behind it - mostly natural, cruelty free - and it had some really great reviews all over the internet.  </li>
      <li>Incredibly drying, and although I am fine with shampoos that don&#x27;t lather up into big mounds of bubbles, this was so lifeless it was difficult to massage into my hair.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Then, rinse very</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Focus on the roots and scrubbing your scalp gently.  </li>
      <li>I really like their face wipes too.</li>
      <li>Your hair is simply going to feel clean and fresh, the way that our hair is naturally supposed to feel.</li>
      <li>have long, fine hair and that&#x27;s probably part of the issue.  </li>
      <li>I came back to raise the rating by a star because it&#x27;s not a bad product when it rinses out.  </li>
      <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s most obvious on the back of my head</li>
      <li>Many &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; products are either not as green as they claim to be, or cost a fortune.  </li>
      <li>I get that sulfate-free shampoos don&#x27;t lather and you have to get used to the feeling of your hair not getting clean in the shower, but after drying, my hair was a rough, tangled and static mess.</li>
      <li>right now I&#x27;m at work cringing at how oily the back of my head looks and feels.  </li>
      <li>It left my very dry and damaged looking with lots of static.</li>
      <li>New packaging seems to have changed the scent and quality.</li>
      <li>Received old product version instead of new product as shown in picture.  </li>
      <li>Now it is clear, strips moisture</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, I find myself using a lot of the product to get a lather (which wasn&#x27;t completely unexpected, given the lack of SLS).  </li>
      <li>and I also like how soft it makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>So when I started to switch over to all natural beauty products it took some getting used to.</li>
      <li>Natural shampoos do not contain sodium laurel sulfate</li>
      <li>This shampoo is a very suspicious-looking pearly mint color, the consistency of dish-soap, and doesn&#x27;t have the same smell.  </li>
      <li>My hair does feel clean, if a bit limp.  </li>
      <li>I suppose that I&#x27;ll finish the bottle; I just make sure that I use a ridiculous amount so that everything can be rinsed</li>
      <li>Like most people I had been using Pantene and Loreal and was so used to all those chemicals and my hair constantly coated with the slick synthetic junk.</li>
      <li>I could even feel the texture of my hair was bizarre while I was drying it with my usual styling brush.</li>
      <li>I gave this product at least a dozen tries and each time I made sure to wash really well</li>
      <li>so they do not lather as much, which means that they are not going to strip your hair and leave it sticky and dry.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve gone through more than half a bottle in two weeks, much quicker than I usually go through shampoo, which is why it&#x27;s still only at 3.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought I would like this.  I love the smell of cucumbers. I have colored hair. I have slightly dry hair.  This shampoo is worse than the ones I have been using which were Pantene and hotel samples.  Yes to Cucumbers made my hair drier and less silky and shiny.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a  couple of years now, still like it.</li>
    <li> Gently cleans and protects my fine, color-treated hair.</li>
    <li> On the plus side, this shampoo makes my hair soft, and seems to do a good job of preserving my color.  HOWEVER, it stings my eyes terribly (and no, I am not washing my eyes with it!).  I have used a lot of shampoos over the years, and this is the only one that has stung like this.  I suppose it&#x27;s just my body chemistry, and YMMV, but I will have to switch to something else.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is clear and thick, almost gel-like, and cleans without stripping hair color.  It also doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and has a  fresh and bright cucumber scent.  The  PROTECTION (explanation for the all caps lettering below) shampoo worked so well, I only needed to wash my hair every other day!  And believe me, that&#x27;s a first. (Of course, you always need to shampoo properly.  Which means putting the shampoo in the palm of your hand, adding a touch of water, and working into a slight lather before putting on your hair.  Focus on the roots and scrubbing your scalp gently.  This gets rid of the oils and product that makes hair greasy and heavy.  Don&#x27;t worry about &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; the rest of your hair, just by massaging and soaping the scalp and roots, the shampoo will get distributed thru the hair, without damaging it.  Then, rinse very thoroughly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:  Unfortunately, this product (the one I ordered and reviewed) was not what I got.  I received, instead, the shampoo from their &amp;#34;Color CARE&amp;#34;  line.  This shampoo is a very suspicious-looking pearly mint color, the consistency of dish-soap, and doesn&#x27;t have the same smell.  It&#x27;s a weaker and more artificial scent.  Even shampooing my hair like a pro ; )  this product leaves my hair dull, and greasy by the end of a single day.  Forget going two days!  The conditioner in the &amp;#34;Color Care&amp;#34; line is also useless.  I am going back to Target to buy the Color Protection line there, as I can&#x27;t be sure the product I wanted and ordered will be the one I get.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and associated conditioner are the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried. It left my very dry and damaged looking with lots of static. I thought my hair might be dry and staticky because of the cold but when it warmed up I still got the same results. I could even feel the texture of my hair was bizarre while I was drying it with my usual styling brush. I don&#x27;t like to waste and will usually finish up products I don&#x27;t like but had to make an exception in this case. It was so awful I just threw it away. I&#x27;d give it no stars if that were possible.</li>
    <li> I have used both the shampoo and conditioner for years now.  I am very &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;/eco conscious and strive to find personal care products that are chemical free but also a good value. Many &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; products are either not as green as they claim to be, or cost a fortune.  This line has great ratings on the EWG Skin Deep Database and has a good price tag as well.  HOWEVER, the original formula was much better.  It was much thicker, had a nicer fragrance, and performed better. Unfortunately, I often find that after a company &amp;#34;reformulates&amp;#34; (code for watering down the product to increase margins and profits), it&#x27;s never the same.  The new product is just ok and is not as good a value, so I&#x27;ll be shopping around for something new.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered this is my favorite Shampoo of all time! I get my hair colored about two-three times a year and this is good for colored hair. Yes to Cucumbers is the best out of the bunch at least for me I have blonde hair that goes to my butt and it is sooo easy to brush with this shampoo plus the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Very mixed reviews here, and I have a feeling it depends on the type of your hair. I have fine hair, and this shampoo was terrible for me. It made it extremely dry, brittle, and tangled even after using the matching conditioner. I love the YES TO products, but this one was a miss. I wrote to the company and they were extremely receptive to my complaints, and I&#x27;ll be trying their other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I recently started using Say Yes to Cucumbers Shampoo. I love the fact that it is sulfate free which makes it safe to use with colored hair. It does not weigh my hair down or make it look oily. I was surprised that it lathers better than most sulfate free shampoo. I also get migraine headaches from fragrances. However, this shampoo is refreshing yet mild.</li>
    <li> I do not like the reformulation at all. It used to be gentle and a creamy green color. Now it is clear, strips moisture and I can&#x27;t seem to keep it out of my eyes.  It burns badly. I  will never repurchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo but when I received it the bottle wasn&#x27;t even full!! Paid full price for 3/4 of a bottle, very dissatisfied!</li>
    <li> Incredibly drying, and although I am fine with shampoos that don&#x27;t lather up into big mounds of bubbles, this was so lifeless it was difficult to massage into my hair. Watery, weird, drying, and didn&#x27;t seem to clean my scalp well. Not a fan!</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner for the smell and I also like how soft it makes my hair feel.  I really like their face wipes too.</li>
    <li> New packaging seems to have changed the scent and quality. I have decided to switch to another product after using Yes to Cucumbers for  many years.</li>
    <li> Great smell &amp; I love that it has no harmful chemicals but it does NOT lather well at all! For the amount I have to use to get my hair feeling like I actually have shampoo in it, is ridiculous considering the price of this shampoo. I go thru it sooo fast! I have been using the natural walgreens brand Ology cucumber shampoo &amp; I like that one much better, lathers much better &amp; smells almost as good. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Like most people I had been using Pantene and Loreal and was so used to all those chemicals and my hair constantly coated with the slick synthetic junk. So when I started to switch over to all natural beauty products it took some getting used to. Natural shampoos do not contain sodium laurel sulfate so they do not lather as much, which means that they are not going to strip your hair and leave it sticky and dry. Your hair is simply going to feel clean and fresh, the way that our hair is naturally supposed to feel. This shampoo from Yes To is not as luxurious as some other natural brands but it is a good one to try because it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
    <li> I color my hair pretty seriously, but I refuse to let it look damaged. Yes to Cucumbers is THE BEST shampoo to both smooth/nourish while simultaneously keep from stripping the color from my hair. It&#x27;s also very healthy for my hair. So it&#x27;s a win win win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoothing shampoos are what I turn to in order to repair damage, but smoothing means oil, and oil pulls color out pretty viciously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus for this product is that there are NO SULFATES. Sulfates are the lathering component of most shampoos. They are what get rid of your &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; oils, but sulfates also inhibit hair growth and can induce hair loss or thinning.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo.  I like the idea behind it - mostly natural, cruelty free - and it had some really great reviews all over the internet.  But I just can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I find myself using a lot of the product to get a lather (which wasn&#x27;t completely unexpected, given the lack of SLS).  It wouldn&#x27;t be a problem except that sometimes, not all of the product can be worked into a lather.  If the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather - and get a good lather, at that - it doesn&#x27;t wash out.  And you don&#x27;t notice that it hasn&#x27;t until your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s most obvious on the back of my head (I tend to start scrubbing nearest to my face so it definitely gets a lot of lather up front).  I shower/wash my hair every day and right now I&#x27;m at work cringing at how oily the back of my head looks and feels.  And I&#x27;m kind of paranoid the people have noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, fine hair and that&#x27;s probably part of the issue.  This might be a moisturizing benefit to someone with dry, thicker hair.  But it&#x27;s definitely not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had this problem with a shampoo before.  I suppose that I&#x27;ll finish the bottle; I just make sure that I use a ridiculous amount so that everything can be rinsed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED 5/28:  I came back to raise the rating by a star because it&#x27;s not a bad product when it rinses out.  My hair does feel clean, if a bit limp.  But I&#x27;ve gone through more than half a bottle in two weeks, much quicker than I usually go through shampoo, which is why it&#x27;s still only at 3.</li>
    <li> It smells good and I will probably buy it again, but it foams so it must have some form of sulfate in it.</li>
    <li> The older product was much better! This version just does not work for me at all. I get that sulfate-free shampoos don&#x27;t lather and you have to get used to the feeling of your hair not getting clean in the shower, but after drying, my hair was a rough, tangled and static mess. Strands literally felt like a hay broom and there was residue on my scalp. I gave this product at least a dozen tries and each time I made sure to wash really well but the outcome was the same. I hated my hair for 5 weeks and am throwing the bottle away.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It smells great and made my hair feel nice.</li>
    <li> Received old product version instead of new product as shown in picture.  Did not lather well. The new version works great though.</li>
