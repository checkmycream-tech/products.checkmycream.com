<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> comes in handy when you need it. works great</li>
    <li> Unable to tighten down Collette</li>
    <li> The product is very good. It performs exactly as it should and is easy to handle ..Would recommend it to people looking for a small portable drill ....Howard Kenvin</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my product, thank you</li>
    <li> This nail dremel works great! I currently use it on my acrylic nails at home. I love it. It came with really neat attachments. I love how it will stop charging it when it has a complete charge so it is less likely to overcharge the battery. It works great and the attachments are great. The only negative thing that I experienced is that when I opened the package the dremel fell right out of the plastic package. Almost like it was already open, but that is not a big deal. It was not used or anything. It probably fell open through all the shipping. Speaking of the shipping it was shipped here relatively fast. I only had to wait a few days. So that was wonderful. This is a steal if you are looking for a great dremel and the best part is the price!!!</li>
    <li> I like this very much.  It is sturdy and precise.  Also comes with all the attachement you need and then some.  You will not go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend, easy to use, great for nails, callus,  works fantastic. Highly recommend,  great product and I am not a nail tech, just for my grooming needs.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing an electric nail file, but the main reason I choose this particular model was because of all the different tips and the power of the motor. I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. It was reasonably priced and has been very easy to use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This thing is great, maybe a little too great!! The first time I used it, I must have had it on a little too high because it almost when through my nail!! Be careful and start on a low setting and work your way up!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Perfect for beginners. Although its a little bulky, but it&#x27;s manageable! Great price too! I would really recommend this for anyone starting out the adventure of doing your own acrylic nails!!!</li>
    <li> I do not like this machine. The sanding sleeves do not stay in place during use. Would have been better getting a cordless dremel machine. I am very disappointed in this item.</li>
    <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;Best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend to anyone wanting to buy such a tool.&lt;br /&gt;After using it I bought a second one for a present to a friend.</li>
    <li> The only minor complaint I have is the weight - it is a bit awkward to hold it in your off hand because of the bulk. As far as power goes - I haven&#x27;t had to turn it up past 6, so its definitely got some juice. Definitely worth the price, especially with all the added bits and a good 10 files.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 5/17/15: My dill has officially given out on me &#x3D;( which sucks because I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times. I&#x27;m looking to purchase another drill and will be consulting my nail tech friends for a reliable drill to use at home.   So far so good. I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a month. I haven&#x27;t used it for a full set of nails, but to fix a nail here or there when I don&#x27;t want to go to my nail girl. I use the low settings and it&#x27;s fine on my nails. What I don&#x27;t like is that sometimes my drill will charge Nd sometimes it won&#x27;t. I have to wiggle the cord the get the drill to charge, otherwise it does work with the cord plugged in. Weird.  I did buy a small gold fine coarse bit from another Amazon seller and it fits with this drill. Money well spent I&#x27;d say considering I only need this for the rest ccasional nail fix. I will update if anything else happens.</li>
    <li> Just opened, charged the battery, and doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This only worked once.. After the that complete failure.</li>
    <li> This is my second one works great.other one still working gave it away</li>
    <li> Good tool to keep toenails shape</li>
    <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
    <li> after buying this item, i read some 1 star reviews. and as a long time customer, i wonder why products are able to be sold without a return policy . if i have known about this i would have never have bought it. i don&#x27;t always read every review or every word about the item description. but i do know what i want and base that on my common sense. item arrived today and i bought this because of my bad back. i needed a way to trim my toenails without hurting my back. item seems to work fine. except i made my toe bleed by not being used to it yet. in the future i will be more aware of no refunds before i by again. no one wants to waste money on items that have a &#x27;sale is final&#x27; or due to FDA regulations item cannot be returned.</li>
    <li> Powerful and not painful. Has helped greatly</li>
    <li> I tried this product even though there were a few poor ratings. It definately gets the job done but the attachments keep popping off of the drill. One even popped up in my face because I was close in order to see. I am in the process of returning it.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails and I hate the filing.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy a drill because of cost.  When I came across this I had to try it. It is perfect for me.  I think if you did a lot of nails it may not last but for my own use it is perfect.</li>
    <li> This drill is way better than one I bought at a beauty supply store and was cheaper. It will so much faster to do my nail now .</li>
    <li> Great! Works great and exactly what i was expecting! Nice and convenient wireless nail drill to use on mine and clients!</li>
    <li> This drill has served well for 6 months+ and going strong. It is heavy and much bulkier than most drills due to it having the charging media built in, but does the job. Also not as powerful as a plug-in drill but this thing wasn&#x27;t meant to compete with professional drills. Its mostly a student thing, or someone like me who does their own nails and didn&#x27;t want to blow tons of money. I have since let a family member borrow this as I have upgraded to a more advanced drill.</li>
    <li> like that it is rechargeable~works great</li>
    <li> It is great; although, I did have some trouble with changing the instruments.  I had to go to the internet for help.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. My wife likes it and that&#x27;s all that matters. For the price I think it is a good deal and works well.</li>
    <li> Had this over a year now and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet and I use this on a regular doing nails.</li>
    <li> Works great. Especially for tough toe nails. Works well on cuticles.</li>
    <li> Product did not work right out of the package.  After the device not taking a charge, I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful tool that does a good job on manicures/pedicures, however, the enclosed \\&quot;directions\\&quot; are sadly lacking in actual facts about how to use the tool! I had to figure out on my own how it works and what attachment to use for the job I wanted it to perform.  There is nothing that even tells you how to turn it on! I&#x27;m hoping I have correctly interpreted each attachment and used them appropriately. I guess time will tell.  I am not a nail technician, merely a customer who wants to save some cash doing self-manicures and pedicures; given that I would assume there are many customers just like me, one would think the manufacturer would have seen fit to include detailed instructions on how to properly use their product.  There are 3 lights displayed...I have figured that the red light comes on when it is time to charge the battery and the green light is self-explanatory; however, what is the yellow light for?  It is on all the time with the green light.  What does this mean?  Again, proper instructions would have included that information.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect and easy to use.  Very course sanding for tough toe nails to a smooth down finish attachments included and easy to change out.  Like to portability of charge and use anywhere.</li>
    <li> its good not the best has speed levels and multiple attachments and the cordlessness is awesome</li>
    <li> Great product.  I do my own manis and sometimes my own pedis.  I am currently doing both because I am a pregnant meatball and I can&#x27;t stand the smell of the nail salons.  This cuts down on my &amp;#34;reaching time&amp;#34; significantly and has allowed me to finish the job before I can&#x27;t take it anymore. The only thing is it is quite heavy.  Also, if you are using it on your real nails, be careful with the very abrasive file tips and use it on a low speed until you are comfortable with it.  Those tips are a bit aggressive for natural nails.  I found the stone tips work better for my manis.</li>
    <li> I bought this manacure item for my pets actually and my rabbit in particular.  It works fabulous.  I tried a few different heads, but the best for the toe nails is the sanding head.  I tried it on the guinea pigs, dog and rabbits and it works great. It&#x27;s WAY better than clippers because you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting too deep and hitting the blood line if they jerk their feet around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also worked on some caluses on my husbands feet and it works great for that too, you just have to use light pressure or it feels like it&#x27;s burning your foot.  I&#x27;ve only had it a month or so, so I can&#x27;t say how tough the machine is, but it seems well made and easy to charge.  It has variable speed, so you can turn it down when you need to do close work and faster when you have a lot of nail to burn through.  I did notice the motor heats up after a short while, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to affect the motor and it&#x27;s still ok to handle while warm.</li>
    <li> This is nice because it is rechargeable, has accessories available, and does a really good job of sanding/filing/callous removal.  The podiatrist recommended it and he was right.</li>
    <li> This product delivers exactly what u see in the photo but is not at all worht the price i full charge the drill and with just 5 min. of use it starts to mal function just shutting off sayin fully charged and not coming on at all very disapointed specialy after being charged 20 dollers extra for the transaction very disapointed :(</li>
    <li> This item was not up to my expectations. Once charged the nail drill does not hold a charge. lucky if you can file 1 nail before having to recharge. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to all nail technician.  This works excellent.  what I like most about is how it holds the charge. This is truly a wonderful tool.</li>
    <li> Too many uses to count.  Nails, dogs nails, household minor tasks, touch up on dental pieces...you just have to find the speed and drill bit that works for the project and start taking care of the problem.  Easy to handle and without the cord to get in the way, it&#x27;s so handy.  Glad I bought this Nail Drill.</li>
    <li> Just like many people are saying it quit working after a few weeks. The reason it fails is because the battery is improperly secured and flops around on the circuit boards shorting it out. Went to the Walmart and bought a 4.8 volt two speed dremel made in mexico with a two year warranty. Wrap a little tape around the tools that came with the Vogue to fit the bigger collet so it won&#x27;t be a complete loss.</li>
    <li> This drill is huge.... Not even feasible as a nail drill.... Maybe to put nails in a wall. Also,  the bits it comes with are not helpful... It needs lower grade sand bands... The ones it comes with I swear are to file wood down.&lt;br /&gt; It hurt like hell on my nails.</li>
    <li> So disappointed..it broke after only four uses.  And seller says it&#x27;s not returnable.  The button broke loose on second use and off on the forth.  Now it won&#x27;t run at all .  But light comes on .  Errrggg</li>
    <li> Worked great twice then died completely.  Acts like it&#x27;s charging then stops charging after a minute and won&#x27;t turn on.  Unfortunately a waste of money.  Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> I do not know how to operate well. It does not stay secure when using the drill. I do not even know how to put it together.</li>
    <li> this sucks, just use it twice and stopped working, do not waste your dineron is this article! do not waste your money</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product because attaching the ends is difficult and a part has already fallen off. Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the cost of the item is great, works very well, holds a charge for a long time, I would tell a friend to buy it</li>
    <li> It has Lots of power.  Works very well and has useful attachments.  Saw the same one at a professional salon.</li>
    <li> The tool works well but the sanding tubes won&#x27;t stay on. All other attachments work well. I was hoping to find one with a longer handle that was rechargeable but had no luck. I am overall happy with the tool but wish the sander was better,</li>
    <li> I used the drill to do my friend&#x27;s acrylic nails, and by time I go to the second hand the drill was hot and shut off automatically, I waited awhile before starting it up again, and when I did it would only work in the slowest speed and would not adjust when I moved the speed up. It also would shut off as soon as I touched her nail with the file. It was my second time using the drill. The first time it worked great.</li>
    <li> To my surprise during the holiday rush of things, this product came in before the expected  date given. My daughter was very happy with it</li>
    <li> This is so great, I wonder how I did without it for so long. It not only makes my manicures easier, it also doubles as a hobby tool Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this drill to learn to do gel nails. I had it around 7 months using it maybe 8 times a month and it just stopped working right in the middle of a appointment. I would not recommend this product it does not hold up. From other reviews it looks like the company is quite hard to deal with for returns as it&#x27;s a final sale :(</li>
    <li> It have been worked for a week , and i can&#x27;t use it anymore. it just like a toys with low quality.</li>
    <li> Even plugged in this doesn&#x27;t work well. I&#x27;ve had it for six months and it stopped working completely. I have no kids, I kept it in a drawer, and I take care of my things. Don&#x27;t buy this tool unless you want to waste money.</li>
    <li> Works good except not too powerful.</li>
    <li> Works great to keep fingernails and toenails in in perfect shape.  Charge holds very well.  The multiple speed levels is a plus also.</li>
    <li> It worked fine the first week . After one week it wouldn&#x27;t charge and its dead. I don&#x27;t know what to do at this point. I tried to change a charger but didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I used it one time, set it aside, went back to use it again maybe a week later and it just stopped working.</li>
    <li> I have been VERY disappointed in this purchase!  The Vogue Professional Nail Drill will NOT stay on.  It is very sporadic!  When it works this item does a very good job.  However, if I want to use it frustration is paramount!  I want it to work ALL THE TIME!  And be assured, this happens when it is fully charged.  The mechanism inside is faulty!!  Not my usual experience with Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Vogue nail drill did not operate when I received it and was a huge disappointment!  I noticed that there were other reviews that had the same comment.  If you need a nail drill I suggest looking at another brand.</li>
    <li> A great pro unit. CAUTION!!! NOT A TOY. Give yourself a little time and practice . The speed and efficiency of the abrasive heads can burn skin faster than you realize that your almost to the bone!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this nail drill.  So glad  I bought this and it works very well.  If you buy this you will be very pleased.  Do it today don&#x27;t hesitate. Very easy to operate.</li>
    <li> Great tool.  I also used it on my dog.  It works well.  Seller was very efficient.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> no instructions on how to put it together or use it</li>
    <li> For thick long toenails this product is great. Got them thin enough in order to cut them down before even going to the nail salon.  I was able to drill from the inside of the nail. Speed levels are great. Love the different drill heads.</li>
    <li> I have two very thick toenails and I have trouble keeping them short.  Consequently, wearing shoes hurts those two toes.  With the nail drill I can sand down the nail and I am able to clip the nail. my toenails feel better and look better as well. I also love all the other attachments to keep my nails looking great without going to a nail salon.</li>
    <li> Off and on/ speed doesn&#x27;t work correctly.  I almost think it has a short of some kind in it. When it does work, it works well, but I never know when and for how long. I wish I would have purchased a better product.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller. Easy to use and very versatile. I recommend it to everyone. I use it regularly and I am fully satisfied.</li>
    <li> I like the size of the unit. But the speed isn&#x27;t adjustable enough for me (could be slower for use around the cuticles) and the bits come loose while in use.</li>
    <li> good quility. Could use a few more file attachments, but over all good unit. Found usefull for filling down small wood or plastic objects.</li>
    <li> The only issue I have is that the debris flies everywhere and there&#x27;s no real way to keep it from spreading and inhaling it.  But the charge lasts well, and the various levels of speed are enough to adjust to what you&#x27;re filing.  The bits that come with it are more for acrylic nails.  To buffer natural nails, there&#x27;s one bit that works to file and smooth, but to polish and finish you&#x27;ll need a separate buffer piece.</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased this rechargeable drill instead of the battery-powered.  I tried the battery powered years ago and they seemed to not keep their power and they would just eat through batteries.  I would recommend you stay with drills that can be powered or charged through an outlet or some other way.  Just don&#x27;t get the battery-powered kind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m beyond happy with this product! I wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;d have enough power to clean my artificial nails as nicely as I&#x27;d like, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised as it&#x27;s gone beyond my expectations and I couldn&#x27;t be happier as my nails look great! I love that it holds a charge for so long so it makes it convenient to take with me when I travel. My nails love this little powerhouse!!</li>
    <li> This does what I hoped it would do.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the timing of the shipment considering I ordered it on Monday and it was at my door on Friday but I opened the box and everything was out of the plastic packaging just rumbling around in the box because it was stuffed in a box a size too small so my first fear was that it might not work since it couldn&#x27;t even be packaged properly. Luckily it works and I&#x27;m happy with all the different bits and power to it, although it&#x27;s bulky. Love the fact that it&#x27;s cordless so that won&#x27;t be in the way and rechargeable so I&#x27;m not buying batteries all the time. Thankyou!</li>
    <li> I think the model is a bit bulky. The button to release or install the tools doesn&#x27;t work that well. I had to press the button down and spin the tip to a certain position in order for the button to go all the way down. The adapter, when I plug it into the model, the red light goes on when I haven&#x27;t even plug it into the outlet yet. Not sure if that&#x27;s safe.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this drill. It shipped in literally 2 days. It is a bit bulky, but if you know how to use it, it works just fine. I was concerned about the power of the drill. I&#x27;ve bought these types of drills before and they never had enough speed. This one was PERFECT!!! It has 10 speeds, although I may never get past speed 5, it&#x27;s still good to have. Works just like the professional ones, and its cordless. TWO THUMBS UP!! :)</li>
    <li> Money well spent.  I am learning to do my own gel nails and this product works great!  I am so glad I got the cordless drill. The Charge lasts a long time and it comes with a charger.</li>
    <li> When I received this product, it was packaged correctly and new.  I found the drill bits difficult to place into the head.  The black button was hard to use.  When I finally got it set up with the sander, it worked well.  I used it about 6 different times.  First the electric recharger started then stopped.  I think their is a short in the black wire.  Then the drill itself started to work intermittently.  I purchased this at a good price, got some use out of it, and now have to buy another nail drill.  I threw out the packaging, and my order history is the only record I have.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas present, I had tried other ones, but this one I love, just recommend that you charge after each use, but love it, no problems, cuts my filing time....</li>
    <li> Sorry had to return what I thought would be an ideal tool because it was defective and&lt;br /&gt;would not even charge after using it only 3 times for a short period of time. I was very&lt;br /&gt;dissapointed! :(</li>
    <li> Its strong and works very good. Plus the handle is easy to hold. I do a lot of traveling and it 110/220</li>
    <li> Stop working by the 2nd week!!&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t use it much only to take gel off my toes and it stop working even the cord is plugged, bad investment for something is cost a lot more than other hand drill, I bought it because it has speed setting and smaller grid Handel and quieter l, it is a little too long.</li>
    <li> Best investment for my toes I ever made. Very solid &amp; quality construction. Seems like it will last forever.</li>
    <li> One of the attachments was missing.</li>
    <li> I read too many bad things about this product that someone could say i took a stupid chance buying this. The thuth is that the product came un-opened (new -  as expected) and has been working well since then. That has been about three months by now. It is not for a beauty shop for what I can see. I doubt it will last on a daily use basis. Just ok for home and personal use.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Very professional.</li>
    <li> This nail trimmer does everything I expected of it.  Well built.  An added benefit is that I will be able to use it to sharpen my chain saw blade.</li>
    <li> Very good product! is wonderfull and especial, easy and comfortable, no problem in any time, i love this product !</li>
    <li> Really good It serves the purpose ! Also, it is great to have the feature to recharge the battery .</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 45 yr old corded drill (which still runs fine-but was cumbersome).  I love it-especially the fact that it has so many variable speeds!  My only complaint is that I bought the specific sanders made by Vogue for specific nail drill.  They were a teeny bit too large because when it would get to a point where it would be sanding and you had to apply a slight pressure, it would stop spinning because it was too lose. In other words, the drill would continue spinning but the little cardboard sanding cylinder wasn&#x27;t made tight enough to handle the stress of even just slight pressure.  So I tried another sanding cylinder, and another one. After the third one, I realized that they just weren&#x27;t tight enough.  I will figure out a way to make the sanding cylinder fit well enough to work, so I&#x27;m not too worried about it...&lt;br /&gt;The drill works so well that I can handle a lose cylinder for sanding.  It is very high quality and holds a charge for a long time!</li>
    <li> Not a professional nail tech (yet), but love doing my own nails and the money I save now,  paid for this drill already using it one tim! ..It has very strong/fast speeds but use low most of the time.  .I love that I can do my nails anywhere....on my deck, in the car on trips, etc.  The Negatives: I gave it a 4 stat only because, it is awkward to handel at first because it is a  tad top heavy (but I got used to it quick) . You have to use an  adapter (comes with it) so you can fit a standard 3/32 bit.  Even then, the bits that come with this set are shorter and I have had before, but still works fine...also you have to hold a button and turn a dial  to change the bits.  Annoying, but again, you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the speed dial on the hand piece!  Don&#x27;t have to stop to change speeds. I also do my and my husbands toenails etc......so much faster!&lt;br /&gt; I had already bought a corded drill here on Amazon but the cord was awkard and had to stick close to a plug.&lt;br /&gt;This drill is a great deal too, my sister bought a different cordless drill from Sally&#x27;s paid over $100.  If you are just beginning or just want to smooth out your feet or hands at home, this is perfect!!</li>
    <li> This nail file worked great until it just recently died after only eight months of use. It wasn&#x27;t even used a lot during this time I have owned it. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love the drill and it&#x27;s price. I shopped around and this drill is a lot more than what I got it for on here. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the screw on drill bit. You don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s tight or not but other than that it works wonderful</li>
    <li> This is the worst purchase I have ever made!  It never worked. It would not turn on. I had to keep middle of machine (where motor is)  pressed for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for three weeks by pressing middle of machine, it finally would not work at all.!!! I lost all my money.  I was informed that it could not be returned.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and happy with product</li>
    <li> Great tool.  Especially if you have bad hands and need items with large handles.  It worked as advertised.  Shipping also on time.</li>
    <li> I had a thick toe nail. I actually got it under control with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;It is actually quite powerful.</li>
    <li> Very very fast shipping and the product was exactly like that picture . Very please ... i love how the drill is not loud at all and the file grids are awesome!  Thanks again</li>
    <li> very good and powerful machine. It is cordless and is convinient  for me to use on grinding my dog&#x27;s nail.</li>
    <li> perfect for in between pedicures. just go easy on the nails and rough spots.</li>
    <li> I got this for a gift. The one that I gave it to, says that its a little bulky, but she loves it.</li>
    <li> work very good, good for mani/pedichiure, long lasting battery. only problem is that is a little too big and heavy</li>
    <li> great item quick service</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it&#x27;s made to do.  Has lots of power.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.  I even used in on my hang nail to buff them off.  My hang nails have not come back and it&#x27;s been weeks.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying another one for a spare.</li>
    <li> This works very well for me, and I am very happy that I bought it.  I use it for my toenails which are thickened and otherwise hard to maintain.</li>
    <li> Very powerful nail grinder/ polisher.  Much better than other battery models that stall under load or stop altogether. This models Lithuim batteries are powerful and last longer than cheaper models with AA or AAA batteries. The initial tool tips supplied with this are insufficient as to variety and quantity.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, best tool for finger and toe nails I&#x27;ve had or used!</li>
    <li> I have natural nails not acrylics so maybe this is too powerful a product for my nails.  It works ok on my dog&#x27;s nails although she is a little scared of the noise. I must say though that the first unit seemed to heat up really quickly and was very hot so I contacted the seller and was sent a different one which didn&#x27;t seem to heat up as badly.  If you are looking for something for artificial nails it might be ok.  It&#x27;s very powerful even on lower settings but reminds me too much of a dremel tool to be something I want to use for my nails.  So basically good customer service but not a good product.</li>
    <li> This stopped working and I have only had it a few months....</li>
    <li> Wokrks as advertised, For a beginner the slow speed is great, that way no burns. The fact that it is cordless is a big plus.</li>
    <li> This machine worked great, the first time. After that it stopped working at all. Upon examination the switch is no good.</li>
    <li> I have to say ok; because. About 10 days ago; I button came off to change the bit; it still worked and then I heard something go &amp;#34;ping&amp;#34; and now it stopped working. I am considering buying another one; because it helped me a lot with my nails on my toes. I really have bad toes. And the product worked wonderful on my toes. I was looking forward to using it again. Now I am confused. Really confused. If I can return it? But it was a bargain and well worth the results my encountered!! Wish the seller would reply and give me a good discount??????</li>
    <li> I wanted to start doing my own nails at home, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how powerful I needed a drill to be.  Well, as soon as it arrived, I began using it and it works amazingly!  It files down my nails perfectly, and it files off all of my lifted areas.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Horrible horrible product! Within minutes of having this out of the package and attempting to use it, the tools literally fell apart. I am very familiar with nail drills.. This was a cheap price, but I was using it only for my personal use in my home and assumed it would hold up to once a month use. Ha! Try less than 5 minutes! Save your time and money and do not buy this product. With the metal tools breaking and flying apart you risk getting stabbed.</li>
