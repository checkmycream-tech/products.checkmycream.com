      <li>I bought this on a wim and it works great!</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re a baby boomer, it smells great and does work!</li>
      <li>It brings out spots that even your best concealer can&#x27;t hide.</li>
      <li>and it looks perfectly every time.  </li>
      <li>I had been trying since Feb this year to find the perfect self tanner with no luck.  </li>
      <li>The best sunless tanning lotion I have ever used!</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that I have very fair skin that does not tan well in the sun.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now using Jergen&#x27;s and it works great without any allergy problems.</li>
      <li>The smell of this product is good, not a problem.  </li>
      <li>and I remember the ratings here on Amazon were good, so I bought it.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased with he results.  </li>
      <li>So I tried Coppertone and I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE it!</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>but rather it was kind of an orangish brown.</li>
      <li>it is very easy to use and there is not any streaking.  </li>
      <li>If you want an easy, inexpensive tan, this is the way to go!</li>
      <li>OK, now you will wonder why I love this after my review I am sure, but it&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
      <li>I tried several self gradual tanners and found this to be the best.  </li>
      <li>I love being in the sun and having a tan....</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
      <li>but the next day it looked awesome.</li>
      <li>but the sun doesn&#x27;t love me.  </li>
      <li>I used to LOVE this gradual tanner.</li>
      <li>The color is easy to control.</li>
      <li>This one does not and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I like the smell, the easy application, the price and how it moisturized my skin.</li>
      <li>The Jergen&#x27;s also doesn&#x27;t smell as strongly.</li>
      <li>I was hoping after seeing so many positive reviews for this I could achieve some good results, but unfortunately not.</li>
      <li>After two applications, I had a mild tan!</li>
      <li>This is a great product with such a light scent.</li>
      <li>I have really been surprised at the great reviews this moisturizer gets on many sites I&#x27;ve been on.</li>
      <li>Cheap on here</li>
      <li>this product if you are curious about trying a self-tanner for the fist time and want an inexpensive, easy, beautiful, SUNLESS tan.</li>
      <li>When I first got this lotion, I was in love.</li>
      <li>Worth a shot if you want to try it!</li>
      <li>I added one more \\&quot;coat\\&quot; the next day and, on the 3rd day, decided to maintain that color - a beautiful bronze that I could never even achieve in my wildest dreams, mostly because of my insistence on wearing SPF 50+</li>
      <li>I have tried several self tanners,  this one is the best by far.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as great as I expected, and not as \\&quot;brown\\&quot; as I&#x27;d hoped but not quite orangey either.</li>
      <li>Also, who knew that a self tanner could be such a good moisturizer, as well?</li>
      <li>and the price is not bad either.</li>
      <li>This one does have a smell, but not nearly as bad as the others.</li>
      <li>The first sensation I experienced was the toxically sweet odor that would certainly make me identifiable as a member of the suntan lotion cult if I were to apply it liberally.</li>
      <li>But I quickly changed my mind.</li>
      <li>It is easy to get an even looking tan with this as it tans very gradually.  </li>
      <li>After just one quick and easy application at night, I had a wonderfully healthy looking glow the next morning with no streaks in sight!</li>
      <li>No color is worth melanoma.</li>
      <li>The price was right</li>
      <li>Its a good product and fades quite quickly if you mess up and get too much on your knees.</li>
      <li>I felt confident enough to wear a skirt.</li>
      <li>As for the actual tan, it was okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m working on my 3rd bottle now and completely in love.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff and have an extra two containers in my linen closet.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately I first tried the cautious approach and swathed a test smear of the magic substance on the back of my hand.</li>
      <li>The first day, I think because I wasn&#x27;t used to it, I did feel a bit orange...</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended!!  </li>
      <li>Another big thing is it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor at all</li>
      <li>It seemed to have little self-tanner smell; more of a fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Next day, truly I saw a HUGE difference.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, too.</li>
      <li>I really like this tanning lotion b/c</li>
      <li>And this time of year, I really want to have some color.</li>
      <li>I normally tan very easily and tan dark.</li>
      <li>I have used other sunless tanners before and have been satisfied with the color, but I did not like the smell with one of them</li>
      <li>The most important part though, the color, was no good at all.</li>
      <li>But when it does, it&#x27;s pretty natural.</li>
      <li>You can see a slight hint of orange and it does stain but its better for your body than a tanning bed.</li>
      <li>It does seem to moisturize as well as my normal lotion.</li>
      <li>For the first time in years, people aren&#x27;t asking me if I&#x27;m ill simply because my skin is transparent, and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
      <li>The first time I applied it, I washed my hands thoroughly and wound up with white fingers and hands.  </li>
      <li>My first time using this stuff turned me completely and utterly orange, and I haven&#x27;t used it since then.    </li>
      <li>Usually when I see a product that has gotten great reviews and only a few whiners and complainers, I assume that the product is probably pretty good and that the complainers are just difficult people.</li>
      <li>I am happy to say there were no streaking, and my feet, ankles, and wrists don&#x27;t look dirty.  </li>
      <li>I had been using Jergens Natural Glow Foaming Mousse before, and it did nothing of the sort.</li>
      <li>The only real problem I&#x27;ve had with the product is on the palms of my hands</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t the natural skin tan you develop in the sun</li>
      <li>One thing that I do know is that I&#x27;m allergic to it now, so just a warning; if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin you might want to try another sunless tanner.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave streaks and gives you an even natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>And the odor does not abate after a few hours, its there for many days like red marker dye from stolen bank money.</li>
      <li>AND it is more subtle in appearance.</li>
      <li>From high to low end.  </li>
      <li>I have no other complaints about it.</li>
      <li>I was also surprised to see that the lotion was white!</li>
      <li>After reading reviews on Amazon and another major website that sells this product, I decided to give Coppertone Gradual Tan a try, and if it didn&#x27;t work out, I would only be out $9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
      <li>I bought this in a 2 pack, and I&#x27;ve only used half of the first bottle.</li>
      <li>Fairly good color, and smell is not as bad as some I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

<li> Started with the Estee Lauder self-tanners years ago...and while they are great, almost all self-tanners have a horrible smell.</li>
<li> I have pink undertones and this just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
<li> so I have to be careful of my sun exposure.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used! Love it! I get so many compliments. The color is easy to control. I like that it is white and not brown or orange. It has a slight odor but the final results are extrodinary!</li>
    <li> After reading the directions, I really expected it to be a few days before I noticed any color on my glow in the dark legs. Next day, truly I saw a HUGE difference. It wasn&#x27;t as great as I expected, and not as \\&quot;brown\\&quot; as I&#x27;d hoped but not quite orangey either. Its a good product and fades quite quickly if you mess up and get too much on your knees. That&#x27;s also a bit of complaint, I don&#x27;t want to have to apply so often to keep the color. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend over a sun-tan and melanoma anyday! hah!</li>
    <li> I bought this in a 2 pack, and I&#x27;ve only used half of the first bottle. My first time using this stuff turned me completely and utterly orange, and I haven&#x27;t used it since then.    I was hoping after seeing so many positive reviews for this I could achieve some good results, but unfortunately not. Who knows, maybe I somehow put it on wrong?    But anyways, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I started noticing results after 2 days and it doesn&#x27;t look too bad. You can see a slight hint of orange and it does stain but its better for your body than a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product with such a light scent. I&#x27;ve tried other self tanners that made me look all orangey. This one does not and is easy to use. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, too. I will continue to buy this product. It&#x27;s cheaper than any others I have found as well. Worth a shot if you want to try it!</li>
    <li> So, it&#x27;s not perfect, but nothing is!  If you don&#x27;t like the smell of it, which I myself don&#x27;t preferably care for it, then take vaseline&#x27;s cocoa butter lotion and mix together, problem solved.  The only real problem I&#x27;ve had with the product is on the palms of my hands I get dark spots because of rubbing the lotion in...this can be taken care of w/gloves.  I gave it a four star review, because it seems like a lot of work to make this product work for me...mixing it w/another lotion, wearing gloves, applying it and waiting for it to dry.  But, i&#x27;ll take it over skin cancer any day!!!</li>
    <li> It is easy to get an even looking tan with this as it tans very gradually.  This does mean you will have to apply several times to get, then every 3 or 4 days to maintain, a modest tan.  Fairly good color, and smell is not as bad as some I&#x27;ve tried. I use it instead of moisturizing lotion every 4th morning.  It does seem to moisturize as well as my normal lotion.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion has little to no smell. I feel it is safer to use than others because it has fewer chemical ingredients. I mixed it with some regular lotion when applying to help it spread evenly. No complaints.</li>
    <li> When I first got this lotion, I was in love. It seemed to have little self-tanner smell; more of a fresh scent. But I quickly changed my mind. It turned into a sweaty-feet smelling lotion that felt really heavy on my skin. Not ONLY that, but it stained the sheets. I had been using Jergens Natural Glow Foaming Mousse before, and it did nothing of the sort. It felt so sticky on my skin. It was honestly disgusting. As for the actual tan, it was okay. It takes forever (3-4 days!) for anything to show up at all. But when it does, it&#x27;s pretty natural. A bit yellow, actually. I have pink undertones and this just didn&#x27;t work for me. I ended up giving it to my mother, who had the same problem. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and have an extra two containers in my linen closet.  I am restricted from tanning in the sun anymore and hear much negative reports on tanning salons. I&#x27;ve been doing sunless tanning for years now - and have been disappointed most of the time.  Here comes a product that suits me.  I goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t appear to leave streaks if you&#x27;re careful, and has a a brown tint to it rather than that orangey/bronze that I hate.  It has an acceptable - not obnoxious - smell to it.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> Cheap on here + I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else!  Moisturizing and it tans.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this tanning product to me. My skin is white-I mean, WHITE. And this time of year, I really want to have some color. I don&#x27;t have time to lay out, tanning beds scare me and the spray tan is expensive. So I tried Coppertone and I love it! Apply it just like a lotion and wash your hands real good when you&#x27;re done. After two applications, I had a mild tan! The first day, I think because I wasn&#x27;t used to it, I did feel a bit orange... but the next day it looked awesome. I felt confident enough to wear a skirt. If you want an easy, inexpensive tan, this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I have really been surprised at the great reviews this moisturizer gets on many sites I&#x27;ve been on. Usually when I see a product that has gotten great reviews and only a few whiners and complainers, I assume that the product is probably pretty good and that the complainers are just difficult people. Well, I&#x27;m not a difficult person, but it&#x27;s possible I have difficult skin because I did not like the color that Coppertone&#x27;s Gradual Tan gave me at all. It definitely turned me orange. I have no other complaints about it. In fact, I like everything else about it. I like the smell, the easy application, the price and how it moisturized my skin. The most important part though, the color, was no good at all. Keep in mind that I have very fair skin that does not tan well in the sun. I have used other sunless tanners before and have been satisfied with the color, but I did not like the smell with one of them and I broke out in hives with yet another one which is why I decided to give Coppertone a shot. The color looks like it came from a bottle after only one application. I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> I used to LOVE this gradual tanner. The last time had used it was a year ago, so I decided to buy another bottle. The bottle looked differently, and I just figured the packaging changed. However, about an hour after using it I started getting a massive headache and my skin burned a little. Now I HATE it. So, I&#x27;m thinking they&#x27;ve reformulated it since last year, but I could be wrong. One thing that I do know is that I&#x27;m allergic to it now, so just a warning; if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin you might want to try another sunless tanner. I&#x27;m now using Jergen&#x27;s and it works great without any allergy problems. The Jergen&#x27;s also doesn&#x27;t smell as strongly.</li>
    <li> OK, now you will wonder why I love this after my review I am sure, but it&#x27;s my own fault. Did you know that under your visible skin there are other layers and those contain some damage from sun etc., that have yet to surface? Well try this if you can remember where you were when JFK was killed and you will become a believer. It brings out spots that even your best concealer can&#x27;t hide. BUY and use with caution if you&#x27;re a baby boomer, it smells great and does work! The things it reveals are NOT the fault of the product.</li>
    <li> I am going on a cruise in a week after a long cold Midwest winter.  When I tried on shorts and dresses for the cruise, my legs looked terribly white and ugly.  I read the reviews on Amazon for all sunless tanning products and when I went to my local Ulta Store all they carried was the Coppertone.  The price was right and I remember the ratings here on Amazon were good, so I bought it.  I used it twice a day for three days and my legs look like I have been in the Florida Sun for a week!  I will now cut back to once a day to keep up the tan before I leave for the cruise.  The smell of this product is good, not a problem.  I used it in the morning in place of my regular moisture lotion on my legs.  Highly Recommended!!  I Can&#x27;t Stop Looking at My Legs !</li>
    <li> I really like this tanning lotion b/c it is very easy to use and there is not any streaking.  Another big thing is it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor at all and the price is not bad either.</li>
    <li> And the smell is yucky. Used this for a week and never noticed even the slightest bit of color. I normally tan very easily and tan dark. What made it worse, the smell of this lotion is really old lady perfumy nasty. Try Banana Boat self tanner instead, I saw results after only one application.</li>
    <li> I have tried several self tanners,  this one is the best by far.  Doesn&#x27;t leave streaks and gives you an even natural looking tan.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t are for it - doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I found this to be less streaky than a lot of other self tanners.  Also there is no stange smell.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the 2-pack promotion of this product. I was seeking a gradual sun tan. I hadn&#x27;t been on any trips to tropical locations and summer had long been over so I didn&#x27;t want to show up at work the next day with a sudden inexplicable facial tan. Fortunately I first tried the cautious approach and swathed a test smear of the magic substance on the back of my hand. The first sensation I experienced was the toxically sweet odor that would certainly make me identifiable as a member of the suntan lotion cult if I were to apply it liberally. And the odor does not abate after a few hours, its there for many days like red marker dye from stolen bank money. The next morning I noticed a swatch of discoloration on my hand where I had applied the product. It wasn&#x27;t the natural skin tan you develop in the sun but rather it was kind of an orangish brown. And it doesn&#x27;t wash off. If you experience an \\&quot;omigod\\&quot; the next morning looking in the bathroom mirror there&#x27;s no \\&quot;undo\\&quot; function. I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of returning the product so it is now a permanent detainee in a dark corner under my bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> I tried several self gradual tanners and found this to be the best.  I use this product to maintain an existing tan.  I like that it has an even tan look (no streaks) and wasn&#x27;t too orange.</li>
    <li> For someone who could definitely use some extra melanin, I had been toying with the idea of using a self tanning lotion for quite some time, but never got up the courage to do so with fear of turning orange, smelling pungent, spending a fortune on a product, and/or getting stuck in a time consuming routine just to keep up the tan.  After reading reviews on Amazon and another major website that sells this product, I decided to give Coppertone Gradual Tan a try, and if it didn&#x27;t work out, I would only be out $9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening, I was pleasantly surprised by the smell, expecting the worst. I was also surprised to see that the lotion was white! Maybe it&#x27;s because I was a self tanning lotion virgin, but I assumed that it would be some shade of brown. After just one quick and easy application at night, I had a wonderfully healthy looking glow the next morning with no streaks in sight! Also, who knew that a self tanner could be such a good moisturizer, as well? Now when I shave my legs every morning, it&#x27;s nothing but silky smoothness! I added one more \\&quot;coat\\&quot; the next day and, on the 3rd day, decided to maintain that color - a beautiful bronze that I could never even achieve in my wildest dreams, mostly because of my insistence on wearing SPF 50+ every time I go out in the sun, but I&#x27;m a cancer geneticist, so you should, too! No color is worth melanoma. Anyway, I digress.  I now apply this on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, to maintain. My three suggestions would be to 1) DON&#x27;T wash your entire hands as the bottle says to.  The first time I applied it, I washed my hands thoroughly and wound up with white fingers and hands.  Now, I just use a damp tissue to wipe my palms and nails, but leave the rest be and it looks perfectly every time.  2) Don&#x27;t forget your earlobes and also in between your fingers ever so slightly so you don&#x27;t wind up with webbing. 3) Be careful of your eyebrows and hair if you are like me and have blonde ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Decent Smell&lt;br /&gt;*Easy application for 1st timers with no streaks as long as you rub it all in&lt;br /&gt;*Beautiful BROWN color&lt;br /&gt;*Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to maintain&lt;br /&gt;*Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;*Looks natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*White color makes it difficult to tell where you have already applied the lotion&lt;br /&gt;*Difficult product to find other than on a few websites, which concerns me that it may be taken off the market in the future&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;Get this product if you are curious about trying a self-tanner for the fist time and want an inexpensive, easy, beautiful, SUNLESS tan. For the first time in years, people aren&#x27;t asking me if I&#x27;m ill simply because my skin is transparent, and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> Ive always stayed clearbof sunless tanners, but haveing a two year old makes it difficult to go tan. I bought this on a wim and it works great! After two uses I can tell a difference. I do have one spot where it streaked. But only because I failed to rub it in all the way. This does NOT turn orange. Itsba subtle brown that you can control. Love!</li>
    <li> The best sunless tanning lotion I have ever used! I&#x27;m a Coppertone girl from way back.</li>
    <li> I love being in the sun and having a tan....but the sun doesn&#x27;t love me.  I had a skin cancer last year so I have to be careful of my sun exposure.  With that said I have tried every self tanner out there.  From high to low end.  I had been trying since Feb this year to find the perfect self tanner with no luck.  I had given up, and saw this Coppertone self tanner at the Wal-Mart and picked it up on a whim.  I exfoliated and  applied an aloe based moisturize.  Let that set in about 15 minutes then applied the self tanner.  I was very pleased with he results.  I am happy to say there were no streaking, and my feet, ankles, and wrists don&#x27;t look dirty.  I&#x27;m working on my 3rd bottle now and completely in love.  I apply every other day.  I&#x27;ve even have people complement me on my tan.  They can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a self tanner when I tell them.  Thank you Coppertone!</li>
    <li> Started with the Estee Lauder self-tanners years ago...and while they are great, almost all self-tanners have a horrible smell. This one does have a smell, but not nearly as bad as the others. AND it is more subtle in appearance.</li>
