      <li>Due to Clarins or good gene&#x27;s?</li>
      <li>&#x27;s the link for the hand cream too, which is just as amazing on dry winter hands!  </li>
      <li>If I Could I would rate this 10 stares or higher</li>
      <li>I first tried it because of the 14 oz.  </li>
      <li>was a little concerned about the fragrance; I have severe migraines and fragrance can be an issue; this is very light, very mild, very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I like the Clarins moisture rich body lotion because it protects my skin and makes it feel soft.</li>
      <li>Counterfeit product.&lt;br /&gt;Texture and fragrance are different from genuine product, much lower price as well.</li>
      <li>A bit pricey for hand lotion - but overall a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>When applying to full body, however, it lasts quite a short time.</li>
      <li>It is a body lotion as well, but I use it mainly for my hands.  </li>
      <li>Decent price for high quality - will order again - highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The Clarins New Moisture- Rich Lotion for Dry skin has been my go to body lotion for years.</li>
      <li>When I put it on at night, I wake up in the morning and my skin is just as soft &amp; satiny!</li>
      <li>Smells similar to their other products which is almost like a sunscreen/lavender/musk smell that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands of lotion to soothe my dry, itchy winter skin, but none have compared to Clarins Moisture-Rich Body Lotion for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>His a secret, at Macys &amp; Dillards near Christmas you can save on this cream $10.00 or more large bottle or bottles!  </li>
      <li>Skin feels so soft and hydrated after using...its a keeper</li>
      <li>Not too light, not too heavy....</li>
      <li>The lotion really is moisturizing to the entire body.  </li>
      <li>in the winter especially, i have super dry skin to the point that it looks like my skin is starting to peel like from a sunburn.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft and supple for the entire day.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft and satiny this cream left my skin without any greasy feeling!</li>

    <li> Does superior job at moisturizing my very dry extremities. My friend recommended it. I bought it. Now I recommend this cream as well.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my skin baby-soft.  I&#x27;ve yet to find another lotion that makes my skin feel so nice.  It has a wonderful, subtle fragrance; like all of their products.  The hand cream is also nice, as well as their face creams.  The lotion absorbs quickly, unlike many others.  Clarins is a quality product; expensive, but worth it.  I turned my friends on to this lotion a few years ago.  They are all addicted too!  Try this lotion and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  I think it smells great and is perfect for dry hands.  It is a body lotion as well, but I use it mainly for my hands.  It is not at all greasy. Would definitely recommend this product.  A bit pricey for hand lotion - but overall a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I have used Clarins for many years and I love this product.  Always worth using.</li>
    <li> I have tried oh-so-many brands of moisturizer all my life for my dry cracking skin that sometimes get so bad that it hurts.  This one tops them all.  My skin is soft and supple for the entire day.  It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands of lotion to soothe my dry, itchy winter skin, but none have compared to Clarins Moisture-Rich Body Lotion for dry skin.

    <li> The best moisture-rich body lotion for men and women!  Elbows on men &amp; women is a start. When you shave those legs girls!  When you get sunburn!  At night, after the bath, feet,legs all over!  Enjoy!  His a secret, at Macys &amp; Dillards near Christmas you can save on this cream $10.00 or more large bottle or bottles!  I get 8 for the year cause my man uses it too and Christmas Gifts to my Girlfriends!</li>
    <li> I think realistically its a bit pricey all things considered. I would like to find something that costs less, because I use it so fast.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this body lotion.  I first tried it because of the 14 oz.  Mother&#x27;s Day special.  The lotion really is moisturizing to the entire body.  I feel special, pampered after a shower and applying this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is heavenly!  The best I&#x27;ve ever encountered--lightly floral, but not too much.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m spoiled, Clarins has quit making the 14 oz. and charges the same price for the 7 oz. container.  I don&#x27;t use it as often as I&#x27;d like to because of the cost.</li>
    <li> Lovely, luxurious body lotion. Skin feels so soft and hydrated after using...its a keeper</li>
    <li> I just love this body lotion, it leaves my skin feeling so moisterized and soft!  It smells good too!!</li>
    <li> I use it daily after shower since I bought it. The texture is soft and well moisturizing with lovely scent. Decent price for high quality - will order again - highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best body lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Counterfeit product.&lt;br /&gt;Texture and fragrance are different from genuine product, much lower price as well.</li>
    <li> If I Could I would rate this 10 stares or higher&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a better body lotion plus good&lt;br /&gt;smelling I had very dry cracked feet this worked&lt;br /&gt;expencive but worth every penny buy it you won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;regret it.</li>
    <li> I like the Clarins moisture rich body lotion because it protects my skin and makes it feel soft. When applying to full body, however, it lasts quite a short time. Thus, I&#x27;d rather buy a bigger tube that is also cheaper.</li>
    <li> Such a great product. Moist yet not greasy. Not too light, not too heavy....jusssst right!!!</li>
    <li> This product is just great</li>
    <li> This was apresent for my daughter who was delighted with it and will continue to use and recomend to her friends</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft and satiny this cream left my skin without any greasy feeling! When I put it on at night, I wake up in the morning and my skin is just as soft &amp; satiny! LOVE it! It is well worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the link for the hand cream too, which is just as amazing on dry winter hands!  [[ASIN:B002AMUFGU Clarins Hand &amp; Nail Treatment Cream, 3.5-Ounce Box]]</li>
    <li> very nice product and nice price.i bought for my friend, she is very satisfied with this product. lol lol lol</li>
    <li> Very dry skin; since I had cancer I have no estrogen production and I now have what I call  alligator arms and legs.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and they make work a little, they didn&#x27;t work a lot.  This works a lot.  The lotion seems to penetrate and heal my skin, and the benefit doesn&#x27;t disappear with the next shower.  My skin looks and feels silky and soft; I&#x27;m so happy with this!&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned about the fragrance; I have severe migraines and fragrance can be an issue; this is very light, very mild, very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I really do love this product!</li>
    <li> in the winter especially, i have super dry skin to the point that it looks like my skin is starting to peel like from a sunburn. someone recommended this lotion, so i bought some and used it on my face. it works so well! the peeling skin went away, and just a tiny bit goes a long way. this bottle lasts me almost a full year using it twice a day on my face, and i sometimes use it on my arms, too. i know it&#x27;s not supposed to be a moisturizer for the face, but it works great for that and is much more affordable for the amount you get than their face creams. i love the smell, too. it&#x27;s a light but flowery fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is the only body moisture product I would ever use.</li>
    <li> The Clarins New Moisture- Rich Lotion for Dry skin has been my go to body lotion for years. I have tried others but always go back because my skin is very dry .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man person. I have been using this stuff for over 15 years. A lady friend ( O...What a Friend ). Miss Gloria at the Novi MI 12 Oaks Clarin&#x27;s counter. Introduced me to it and other manly Clarins products. I&#x27;m now over 70 years young and 50&#x27;s chicks down here in Fort Myers are hitting on me as I look years younger. Due to Clarins or good gene&#x27;s? Pass me another blue pill (LOL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All kidding aside... this is Great stuff. But now that I have to pay for it, I only use it on my face, elbows and dry feet areas. I miss Gloria&#x27;s low Claire&#x27;s prices and services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rascal</li>
