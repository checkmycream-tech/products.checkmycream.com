      <li>SO I was extremely happy to see they enlarged the spout part with the new ones so that it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out.</li>
      <li>so it is much more comfortable to use.  </li>
      <li>All natural, you would tend to find the smell not that great.</li>
      <li>More importantly, it takes away any stings and razor burns after shaving.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I once paid close to a hundred dollars for a straight blade shave at a hotel in Las Vegas (still can&#x27;t believe I did that). The guy who did it was, supposedly, one of the best in the biz. I can&#x27;t really recall all the details of what he did but it involved multiple stages of hot towels lotions potions and creams. My eyes were closed for almost the entire time so all I know is what I felt and smelled. I don&#x27;t know what the amazing post shave lotion was that he put on my face because I never saw it, but it smelled and felt exactly like this stuff, which makes my skin feel and smell amazing. Beautifully aromatic and manly at the same time and made with an amazing bouquet of natural ingredients, you&#x27;re sure to love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best aftershave I have used.  It does not contain any alcohol like many aftershaves do. The alcohol they have closes up your pores quickly, but also dries up and abuses your skin. Burt&#x27;s Bees aftershave goes on smoothly.  It is neither oily nor sticky.  This aftershave soothes the skin after shaving, but then moisturizes and nourishes.  The end result is your face feels better.</li>
    <li> Wow. I LOVE this aftershave. All natural ingredients make it very desirable. It has a very manly scent. A bit of sandalwood, some citrus, maybe a little tobacco in there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have alcohol, so if you&#x27;re looking for that &amp;#34;bracing burn&amp;#34; don&#x27;t get this. It moisturizes and I have noticed a difference in redness and irritation if I don&#x27;t use this. The scent is very mild but it does linger for awhile and might conflict with cologne if you&#x27;re so inclined.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down my favorite aftershave.  You should know that this is NOT a tonic, gel, or splash if that is what you are looking for.  This, is a lotion that will dramatically reduce razor burn, feel great as it&#x27;s going on, and leave your skin feeling extremely soft for the rest of the day.  It does have a fairly strong smell (it&#x27;s a good smell) right as you&#x27;re putting it on, but it fades after about twenty or thirty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer said this is a bit greasy.  I don&#x27;t know if I agree with that.  It&#x27;s definitely a thicker balm, but it&#x27;s nowhere near anything like many hand lotions or anything like that.  It&#x27;s still a fairly thin balm but it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friendly tip: once you&#x27;re done shaving (whether it&#x27;s in or out of the shower), splash your face with some cold water, blot your face dry, then apply this lotion.  Most razor burn will disappear within about an hour.</li>
    <li> I do no like strong perfume odors, because they give me headaches. This product according to my husband is a good aftershave cream for him, and the smell is very light and comfortable for us both. Can&#x27;t find the product in stores in our area, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive face and most aftershaves irritate my skin.  This product is all natural (even the fragrance) so my skin is left feeling great and my wife loves the smell!  What more could a guy want?</li>
    <li> Bought this because I&#x27;ve always been pleased with Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this one continues that trend. The lotion leaves your face feeling smooth and helps to reduce any resulting razor burn. I enjoy the smell, as does my girlfriend. My only issue is that is was a little watery than what I&#x27;m used to with other after shaves. This problem is generally overlooked because of all the other benefits I experience when using it.</li>
    <li> I look forward to using this product every morning. The feel and sent of it just makes me happy. leaves me with a very fresh and alive feel on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the aroma of this aftershave and my husband said that it leaves his face feeling a bit slimy for more than an hour after application.  On the bright side, it doesn&#x27;t cause him any discomfort when applied to small nicks on his neck or chin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Nice for smoothing face after shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a father&#x27;s day present on sale and now I wished I had bought out the whole store stock because my husband and I both like it which is a first for us. :-) I can&#x27;t wait to find more of it on sale but I never do.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Works great at remoisturizing and soothing your face, even if you follow up with alcohol based aftershave.</li>
    <li> This product is light, effective, and all natural. For the price, it is an excellent buy. I highly recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great scent. I love it.</li>
    <li> Beware, one of the main ingredients for this product is coconut oil. If you have acne prone skin, this product will cause clogged pores, leading to acne.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  It also as a very subtle scent which my wife loves.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I bought this bundle because it was more cost efficient.  I like the product itself.  It smells pretty good and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a residue.  More importantly, it takes away any stings and razor burns after shaving.  My skin has generally improved with little to no redness on the following day post shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent aftershave.  Has basically the same scent as the now-discontinued cologne.  Seeing that the cologne was not available anymore, I bought some of this, in the hopes that the scent would linger.  It does, but not for more than an hour or two.  I can&#x27;t take any points away for this because it is in fact an aftershave and not a cologne, and makes no claims to lasting all day.  It is a very good product on its own merit.  Not greasy, does not sting.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  It has an understated scent and soothes the skin well.  Considering the skin has been sheared, and the pores open I would highly recommend this or something similar that is derived from all natural ingredients and not synthetics.</li>
    <li> Product was a little higher more costlier than I expected but delivery was quite good. I have used this product and can only give it a fair review, as it was not what I was really looking for.</li>
    <li> My husband has extremely sensitive skin and this product has made his life so much easier when shaving every day.</li>
    <li> No alcohol, smells great, soothing.</li>
    <li> this was the best thing I got for my partner all year from you:) you ROCK!!!&lt;br /&gt;4 more wors required.</li>
    <li> The guys in our family love Burt&#x27;s Bees, girls too. This pack made a great value to divide for gifts.</li>
    <li> I have real sensitive skin, shaving every morning becomes an unpleasant chore. Nothing seems to calm my face irritation and not shaving is out of the question, as my employers require me to shave everyday. I have tried numerous face products. Vitamin e oil was working great for a while, until I had an extreme acne outbreak. I found this product on Amazon while searching for non alcohol based aftershave balm. I&#x27;m glad I found this. I use this aftershave everyday as a face lotion and it really does soothe face irritation caused by razor burns. Shaving has suddenly become a pleasure! This product is made out of natural ingredients, unlike those shave balms with questionable chemicals, everything here is natural. An added bonus, this product smells great!</li>
    <li> I had not wet shaved regularly for your years since my late teens mainly because of the havoc it rained upon my skin.  About a year and a half ago I decided it was time to start again and purchased a DE Safety razor, a brush and some shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the majority of my discomfort (razor burn, break outs, etc.) subsided, something which comes with proper shaving techniques which I was never properly taught and only recently figured out for myself,  I was still experiencing minor symptoms.  I did some research and came across this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used a number of Burt&#x27;s products in the past and finding good or expected results I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot.  I could not be happier with the results of this product.  I simply apply a generous amount directly after my final rinse with cold water and let it work itself in.  The scent is nice, I find it moisturizes well and generally does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two caveats to this product that I have found, both of which I have accepted as part of the package:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first being this product does leave my skin with an unnatural sheen for about 30 minutes after the application, this doesn&#x27;t bother me as I tend to shave at a time of day where it doesn&#x27;t matter.  Just something to keep in mind for some folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is the price.  Not that this is insanely expensive but it is not cheap, especially if you use it daily.  I have found buying it in these three packs helps save a bit of money but I wish I could find a larger package.  This is easily the most expensive part of my shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am more than happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only aftershaves that&#x27;s alcohol-free and is entirely made up of natural oils.  Works great.  It is a little greasy but it makes the skin feel great.</li>
    <li> USE ALL THE TIME AFTER SHAVING OR WHEN I GET DRY SKIN ON THE FACE. SEEM TO TAN BETTER ALSO.</li>
    <li> this stuff goes in the trash. it smells funky and leaves your face feeling slimy, I had to wash my face after using it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome aftershave. However, it&#x27;s very watery and only 2-3 drops are needed to cover the entire shaving area.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stand the chemicals used to scent most aftershaves. Makes me sneeze. Burt&#x27;s uses herbs. Cools the aftershave burn. Only takes a dab.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I love this product, the quality ingredients and natural fresh scent. Feels right to use a natural product, try to pay attention to what we put on our skin and what we eat. Skin looks great, no irritations ever since he started using this aftershave. Thanks!  Update Nov 2014: after using the after shave for a couple of years, my husband decided to start using the shaving cream as well. Good decision! He is not going to use anything else from now on.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now, and it is all I order.  It has almost no fragrance, which I like, but my wife insists that it has a nice subtle smell that she really can only detect when she is really close by, I&#x27;m talking hug and kiss close by ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is non-greasy and absorbs very quickly.  The 3-pack is nice, I can keep one at home, one in my gym-bag kit, and another in a travel kit that I use.</li>
    <li> I love this aftershave.  It was out of production for a while.  Glad it&#x27;s back!</li>
    <li> The only aftershave I&#x27;ll use now! I bought it once at Target by chance and they discontinued carrying it so I had to turn online to get it. I love it that much!</li>
    <li> This is a decent aftershave, and it does wonders for the skin...but the smell is a little offputting, especially if it clashes with another product you use. So while I recommend it for its performance, I suggest you smell it in person before buying.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this aftershave! Smells good, subtle and is very soothing. Best prices right here and I especially love that you can order 3 at a time and save even more!</li>
    <li> My face thanks Burt &amp; his Bees. Other after-shaves dry my face out and leave me with a burning sensation that makes me dread shaving, this stuff is the opposite. Nourishes my sensitive skin and has pleasant yet mild scent to boot.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Not a bad scent. Incredibly soothing and natural. I get bad razor burn and this helps address it immediately.</li>
    <li> Tried other Burt&#x27;s Bee products so thought my husband would like this as well - he does like it.  It feels good going on and has a nice smell.  Just not our favorite smell in the medicine cabinet!  Would buy it again because the product feels good and does it job as being an aftershave - its not cologne.</li>
    <li> Very soothing aftershave. Non-greasy and smells great. I use it also for a nice light moisturizer. Also less than 3 oz so acceptable for carry-on.</li>
    <li> The aftershave is  effective. If you want something cologne like this is not likely to be what your looking for.&lt;br /&gt;It has a scent that is not unlike pine, I like it. It is soothing. You only need one or two drops.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, used it for years.  Moisturizes quite a lot, more of a balm than a splash.  Smell is fantasic, but not too strong.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it, I enjoy the smell and so does he, does not sting or irritate his face and does not leave skin greasy.</li>
    <li> Good aftershave.  Is not alcohol base, so it seems much smoother than normal aftershave.  Not overpowering masculine smell.  Good price</li>
    <li> Highly recommend.  After moving to a new climate half way around the world my skin went crazy especially after shaving.  Great stuff and one bottle last a while.  No greasy feel after using and it soaks right in.  Great product.</li>
    <li> this replaced my nivia lotion and has been working great, and my wife loves the smell. Plus it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees, how can you go wrong with their high quality reputation.</li>
    <li> This is the best aftershave I have ever used.  It&#x27;s all natural and has a great, strong, herbaceous aroma.  I use a dime sized portion to moisturize my entire face.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  He has a sensitive neck, but grows rather coarse and thick hair on it, hence he shaves his neck every other day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Bert&#x27;s Bees is not worth the investment to him--I actually purchased the three-pack for a Christmas present because he is very thrifty and doesn&#x27;t like to spend extra money on personal care products.  I am slowly bending him to the notion of paying for quality rather than quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bergamon oil smell is what I like the most about the product, it also softens his skin.  Very manly scent, no cologne needed when you use this product.</li>
    <li> Best aftershave I have ever used.  My Dad has also fell in love with it after using mine a few times (no irritations, as compared to everything he&#x27;s used in the past).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this aftershave. I always would get lots of irritation and bumps (especially on my neck, which unfortunately gets thick quickly) but I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems after using Burts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and I have to say this is the best aftershave I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer for men with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for a long time, and have found what works best for me. I shave in the shower (moisture being the most important single variable in getting a good shave). I use a Gillette Fusion razor with a built-in light (expensive and unnecessary but I enjoy it). I have found brushless creams to be better than foams or gels. It&#x27;s important to use a shave cream that&#x27;s easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t clog your razor, smells OK, is easy (or even good for) your skin, and which zones properly. \\&quot;Zoning\\&quot; is showing you where you have shaved, and where you have not. Some creams are so light it can be hard to tell. The best shave cream I ever found was Palmolive Brushless, sadly no longer available. I now prefer either Burt&#x27;s Bees or Aveda&#x27;s shave cream, with the former far less expensive than the latter. Close seconds are Kiss My Face, Art of Shaving brand, and Rite Aid&#x27;s RS (the cream, NOT the gel). Kiehl&#x27;s is nice, but too thick. If you use it as a really thin layer, it doesn&#x27;t zone well. Personal preference is obviously of importance here, but the Burt&#x27;s Bees product has one of the better balances of utility and cost. RS is the best overall when you add cost to the picture, but Rite Aid never seems to have many in stock, so it can be hard to find. Shave on!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff a man can put on his face. I only shave a couple of times a week but I apply this cream EVERY DAY all over my face and it gives the perfect moisturization all day. Almost every other face lotion I use will clog my skin pores and give me acne/oily skin but NOT this one. It used to smell horrible but now it smells perfect and has that manly scent I love to wear. This product is perfection, which is why I am leaving this review which I don&#x27;t normally do. Hat&#x27;s off, Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this 3-pack because my last tube of shaving cream was such a pain in the butt. The product itself is great, but the dispenser kept getting clogged due to the tiny hole you had to squeeze the stuff through. I liked the cream so much that I&#x27;d constantly un-clog it though. SO I was extremely happy to see they enlarged the spout part with the new ones so that it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out. Seriously, thank you, Burt. It&#x27;s the little things, you know.</li>
    <li> Quality products coupled with great customer service.  Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> I really like this aftershave. Skin is much better without Sodium Laural Sulfate.</li>
    <li> First time using anything from Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s. Really like this aftershave! Pleasant scent that&#x27;s not overbearing and fades throughout the day. Wife likes it too!</li>
    <li> A very good product. Great smell and completely burn-free leaving a great feeling after shaving.</li>
    <li> This great product truly is gentle on sensitive skin. Most other products (even the sensitive skin stuff) still make the skin red and itchy. Burt&#x27;s Bees really works.</li>
    <li> My husband has been looking for this product for over 2 years before I discovered it online. He is a true Burt&#x27;s Bees fan.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 3 years now and can see that buying it online was great. it a better deal  than getting it at the store, you save money per tube.</li>
    <li> I purchased a tube of this at a local store and liked it very much.  But apparently Burt&#x27;s Bees has changed the formula since then.  Now it&#x27;s more like their (useless) shaving cream.  They&#x27;ve lost the lotion consistency and scent that it had when I bought it at the local store.  The new formula also dries out in the tube, blocking the dispenser.  I&#x27;ll not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful for my foot problems.... skin doc called it exema and is in constant need for moisture... and this stuff does the trick.... it doesn&#x27;t get greasy, unless you overload... rubs right in and has a delicious smell.  Works much better than the stuff over the counter with all kinds of chemicals....</li>
    <li> This is a good product, is natural for my skin and smells great. This is an environment friendly product and I am glad I bought it</li>
    <li> This aftershave is the only aftershave I use now. It is expensive, but these little bottles should last you a very long time. You don&#x27;t need to use much of the lotion at all after you shave; a dime-sized dab of it is more than enough for me. The product itself is also pretty nice if you have sensitive skin like I do; it provides a good deal of relief when I sometimes get a little razor burn/redness. It also moisturizes well and has a mild but pleasant scent. I really can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about it, to be honest.</li>
    <li> Excellent product especially if you have sensitive skin. A little goes a long way and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I am happy to buy low price. But it is small than expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using burt&#x27;s bees natural aftershave for years and decided to but online this time. Product is the same and I will continue to buy online.</li>
    <li> Again I bought this for stocking stuffers &amp; have heard no complaints so I assume they are okay with it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Smells masculine and natural. Keeps facial skin moisturized and toned! No harsh&lt;br /&gt;chemicals or alcohol!</li>
    <li> One of the few aftershaves out there without alcohol so it is much more comfortable to use.  A little goes a long way though.  Someone else said it leaves them feeling slimy which is true if you use too much.  Your face is not a sponge after all.  The scent is not like anything else I&#x27;ve used but it is not bad and fades fast.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this since it was a natural product from a good brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the lotion I received was rancid but this stuff was not pleasant use due to the unpleasant scent... I&#x27;d cringe at the thought of putting it on.  Strangely enough, the initial scent would only last for about 10 minutes and then it would fade.  Once faded there was a lingering citrus scent which was pleasant but not worth fighting through the initial application for.  I&#x27;m thinking perhaps the lotion&#x27;s carrier oil was bad (sunflower oil) but this is my first experience with the product and I&#x27;m thinking a second is not warranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion did moisturize well but left my skin feeling slightly oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this order came with 3 bottles and now I have 2.5 bottles which I don&#x27;t know what to do with.  Test this with 1 bottle before you buy 3.</li>
    <li> Best shave product I have ever used. My skin is in great condition after shaving. Highly recommend this product. Enjoy</li>
    <li> Works great last long does not irritate skin and smells good. No alcohol in cream to irritate skin or turn red.</li>
    <li> Since I do not have a sense of smell (I lost to an attack of Scarlet Fever when I was 4 years old) I cannot personally vouch for the aroma of  Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Care for Men Aftershave, but my skin seems to like it, and my wife absolutely loves the aroma.</li>
    <li> Wonderful AfterShave lotion. I enjoy all of their products.</li>
    <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smell&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;Prevents razor burn&lt;br /&gt;Keeps skin smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;Lotion is very thin.  Not really a problem, though.</li>
    <li> My personal favorite that seems almost impossible to find. More importantly my wife like it!</li>
    <li> Great after shave balm. 3 tubes should last me several years. Fragrance is subtle, which I like.</li>
    <li> Smell is probably the worst part of this product. All natural, you would tend to find the smell not that great. Great product for skin. Very soothing and reduces razor burn.</li>
    <li> I like this. It was one of the only aftershaves I could find that didn&#x27;t have all sorts of bizarre chemicals in it. I used to use ZAK or JAK or whatever it was called, but they don&#x27;t seem to make it anymore. It was just essential oils in some astringent (witch hazel, I think) and it&#x27;s nice to finally find another natural aftershave that also keeps my face from drying out and stinging too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is a little citrusy, but not overly so.</li>
