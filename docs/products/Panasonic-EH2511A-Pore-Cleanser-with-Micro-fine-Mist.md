<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> ...as I applied this ridiculous product to my nose. I truly, deeply wanted to believe that I could vacuum gunk out of my pores and this product sounded like a lot of fun. Nay, a miracle. Now, I read the amazon reviews and knew the chances were slim that I would be among the chosen few reviewers who appear to have been able to conjure magic from this device, but I was willing to buy and try for cleanly facial bliss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I took a hot shower and got ready for a deep cleansing. I got the thing out and applied to my nose and hit the on switch, expecting a powerful blast of suction to evacuate the heck out of my unsuspecting pores.  Instead, a slight whirring noise commenced and i felt an almost indiscernible tugging sensation and a curious blast of tepid mist, which resulted in virtually no change to the status of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure this thing could not suck a loose grain of salt off of a countertop, let alone a blackhead out of a face.  I learned my lesson - I am not a unique snowflake.  The amazon reviews were right. Ignore them at your peril.</li>
    <li> The product is complete, but it doesn&#x27;t have too much strength to pull the dirty out of the pores. It splits a cold water, not so good...</li>
    <li> I use it every week and it work good after shower. For people that have white head problem this is the right one for you</li>
    <li> It took me about a week to figure out how to really use this.  Recommendation, use it in the shower, a hot shower.  It doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot unless your pores are really open.  I use it in the shower once a week, after about 15 minutes of being exposed to hot water, my pores open up and this works just as described.  I would also recommend going very slowly, concentrating on problem spots and staying there for at least 15 seconds.  I have skin that is a combination of both small pores and large ones, and this works for everything.  I also use it every other day, in a much less extensive manner, and it seems to help my skin stay clean and clear.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a totally useless piece of pricy junk. The vacuum is so weak that it will have little or no effect on your skin besides irritating it and making it red.  As for removing,i.e. vacuuming up excess skin oil and opening clogged pores,it is a complete joke. No effect whatsoever.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this ineffective infomercial toy.  Take a look at the Ansr skin care system(also from Amazon) if you want an effective skin cleanser.</li>
    <li> *sigh* After reading all of the other obnoxious reviewers for this product I had to throw in my 2 cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off- if you want this to clear up acne you must first find out what is causing your acne. Not everybody has the same type of acne! For me, I had acne caused by blocked pores and an excess of oil production (sebum). And if you read the name of this product, it is called a \\&quot;pore cleanser.\\&quot;  It cleans out your pores... therefore, if you have bacterial acne or rosacea or some other acne NOT caused by blocked pores then chances are this won&#x27;t clear up your acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my personal experience with this product has been phenomenal. I have suffered with cystic acne for over 10 years and have tried all sorts of OTC cleansers and lotions/creams, etc.  Pore-strips, peels, masks, etc.  Nothing worked because nothing actually cleaned deep down into my pores (did not try a metal blackhead scraper because I didn&#x27;t actually have blackheads).  I ordered this product on a whim, especially since it&#x27;s cheaper than one month&#x27;s worth of cleansers and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my shock and surprise, it worked!  I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and have barely had any acne this whole time.  The quality and appearance of my skin has dramatically improved, and my old acne scars have actually faded away.  My skin is clearer and definitely more toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips- read the manual, people! The mister helps the cleanser slide over your face and keep it from drying out during the process.  Also, though it says not to in the manual, I use it on my whole face not just my T-zone- because I had clogged pores all over. It takes some getting used to but your skin WILL adapt! The trick is to not give up after the first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, definitely use it after a shower. I recommend using a scrub in the shower beforehand. You will also need to moisturize afterwards. I also use a toner before applying moisturizer to help make sure my face is cleansed. If you have agood skincare routine, you&#x27;re probably already doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I used it about 3 times a week, about 20 minutes a treatment.  After just a few months, I was down to once a week for about 10 minutes.  Fastest, easiest and most effective treatment for my acne that I have ever used. Have recommended to many people.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it won&#x27;t get clogged if you simply follow the manufacturer&#x27;s cleaning directions. Again, have had mine for a year and still works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re serious about treating your skin then I have no doubt you will use this product with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 1/4/13*&lt;br /&gt;Just want to throw in a little update in case anyone gets to this review again.&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this cleaner in 2009 and it is now 2013- I still have it and it still works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m down to maybe using it twice a week, sometimes more often, sometimes less, depending on my needs. I can definitely tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it for a long time though!&lt;br /&gt;I still exfoliate before using it (for those who say it just scrapes your dead skin, use an exfoliator first!), and clean it after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that after about 2 years it started getting finicky and the mister would clog sometimes, and the suction would drop. It would also smell a bit (like mildew) if it sat unused for a few weeks. I figured out a solution- the mister will actually recycle the water being pulled in by the suction cup, so I think it started getting clogged and maybe even molding. So I ran some rubbing alcohol and peroxide through the reservoir and through the suction area, along with scalding hot water. Voila! Some black stuff (probably mold) came out of the rear filter! It started working like new again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before people freak out remember- this device uses water and therefore it is perfectly reasonable and natural that mold/mildew may develop. I keep running peroxide and alcohol through it and its still working great almost4 years after original purchase. BEST $30.00 I HAVE EVER SPENT ON FACE CARE!! It is worth the occasional cleansing. I also use a mix of peroxide and water in the reservoir with the mister on for an extra-clean cleansing. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing I want to say to those who complain about the suction being weak- perhaps they got a lemon, but I HAVE actually given myself a hickey on my chin with the thing... If they made it stronger, people would probably have to fill out a disclaimer/waiver in order to use it! People are generally dumb and someone out there would probably really mess up their face if that suction were much stronger!&lt;br /&gt;Granted, this thing isn&#x27;t perfect, but it has literally been the only thing to help with my acne and it has lasted nearly 4 years for me!&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is, everyone is different, but it&#x27;s not a bad price to give it a try. I&#x27;ve spent more on a single bottle of Olay lotion!&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck All!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t remove my comedones.  I have used it several times.  It does take some practice to use it correctly. It does have enough suction to pull some comedones up but not out. I tried steaming my face after showering and different products that soften them hasn&#x27;t helped either. I am going to continue to use it hoping eventually it will make a difference.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with blackheads over the last 10 years. I tried everything from face washes, clay masks, those awful extractors, and nose strips. I even used prescription tazorac from the dermatologist, but none of them worked. As a last resort, I convinced myself to invest in this Panasonic pore cleanser (had a lot of doubt because of the bad reviews), and boy was I so pleased I nearly cried. Even after my first use, it cleaned out all of my pores... so well, in fact, that I was shocked at how my nose looked &#x27;cratered&#x27; from all of the enlarged pores that once housed those nasty blackheads. My skin has never felt so clean, and the enlarged pores thankfully shrink back over time. I use it everyday after a warm shower, so the skin and sebum are soft and easily unplugged. I do use the water mister, as it does help maximize the suction. I slowly go over my nose and cheeks, just as instructed, and am always amazed at how much gunk it pulls out. Overall, best pore cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not cheap, but I save so much money from buying this once, compared to if I continued to buy nose strips, etc. I rarely ever write reviews, but this product very well deserves it. Thank you, Panasonic!  Update: Works so much better while you&#x27;re in a hot shower! I use this after I wash my face with the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]. My skin has never been so clean and looked so fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this with the hopes of actually making a change to my skin. I have very large pores and Biore strips were getting expensive and not to mention, they don&#x27;t do the best job. It seemed to sort of work in the beginning but after a while it really just seemed like I had to put pressure on my skin to actually get the cleanser to work, which defeats the purpose of the product entirely.</li>
    <li> I like many others here were hoping for some miracle of black head free skin. Alas, it seems my elusive search continues. It truly was and exciting day, finally my relief from this horror of skin acne was within my grasp as I opened and charged the device for its first breath. As it charged, my new savior, I took a warm bath and covered my face with how towels thinking of the havoc I soon with bring to the infested colony of sebum who saw fit to claim my nose, forehead and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came the moment of truth, the steam cleared from my view and I saw facing me this frontier of sin across my reflection. Like so many times before my initial reaction was to look away, and ask god what he had done to my face? The faint glow of the led light on the extractor caught my eye, calling out to me ready for the work its been made to do. Lifting it to position I remember a short prayer to the gods of beauty asking this to truly be my salvation. Then as the machine hummed it was pressed forth to the scene of the crime and yelled loudly as the air was sucked clean and skin forced upward into its nozzle. Then as my pigment turn red I removed to see what damage had been done, moving closer to the mirror...closer. Closer yet. Only to see, them. Laughing manically as they had held there ground. This cant be, again I tried. There laughter grew louder. No, surley I can weaken there forces on my forehead. Cheeks? no...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY... why have you disappointed me so?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, bitterly I put the machine to rest in its packaging and sent it home. Maybe my cause is to far lost, maybe. But I put my trust and what little faith I had left in this, now all is lost.</li>
    <li> This pore sucker just does not do what it says it does.  It generates enough suction to make your skin red if you focus on one are for too long but it will not unplug a plug.  Sure, it scrapes off some surface gunk -- that&#x27;s it, though. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this \\&quot;appliance\\&quot; for almost a year.  Work at it all you want, do all things some of the other reviewers suggest you do to get some results out of it--doesn&#x27;t matter.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> This is my skincare miracle!  I have never used a product that improved my skin this much, better results than with any cram or soap or buffer.  I have oily, resistant (opposite of sensitive) skin so I&#x27;ve found that I can use the wide suction devise for longer than the directions recommend.  From the first time I used it my gunky pores and blackheads felt and looked dramatically clearer, my face felt smooth and soft to the touch, stuff that heavy duty mudmasks couldn&#x27;t get was wisked away by the pore vacuum.  With regular use my blackheads are gone and skin is younger feeling and more radiant.  I feel my lotions penetrate so much better now because my skin is wonderfully exfoliated by the vacuum.  This is hands down the best beauty product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have an old Panasonic EH2501 that I have used for several years at least once per month. The water mister is useless, I do not need it, no one does.  I do not use the big suction cup, only the little concentrated small cup side does the job well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, wash your face with a soapy cleanser like a neutrogena bar, this will soften up your skin and the plugs in the pores (cleansing creams or cold creams won&#x27;t work to get the right softness).  You can even steam with a warm wash cloth after the soapy cleanser.  Once your face is softened, then you can use this pore cleanser.  Don&#x27;t let you face get dry at any time during the pore cleansing.  Keep your face wet with warm water, not merely moist. The wetness on your skin will help you have a good sealed suction cup against your skin. The wetness also keeps those pore plugs water-logged and soft and easy to remove. Move the small side cup over skin, keeping the cup constantly moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time, you may get what some call the &#x27;scraping off&#x27; of surface dead cells (since the surface skin is now wet and soft), but keep at it and re-wet skin with warm water if needed and the next time you move the cup over that spot it will remove the contents of pores, now that the surface dead layers are out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not just use this on dry skin misted over using the mist attachment or you will be disappointed.  Don&#x27;t use the big cup side, and don&#x27;t forget to keep the suction cup moving unless you want to create the appearance of a hickey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to buy this brand and product again (I visited the page tempted to get a newer improved model).  I am amazed that there are people that don&#x27;t use it right and blame the product, but then it is also the manufacturer&#x27;s fault for adding a useless mist attachment and representing that you can use this starting out with dry skin.  If I only used the dry skin and mist approach, I would be angry about the experience too.too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I owned the original model which didn&#x27;t work well. So I was excited about the new one. I thought the suction would be stronger. Unfortunately, I experienced the same poor results. Other people rated the product highly but I think I have really plugged pores! I would pay $200+ if something would work for me. I wish I could give a review that said \\&quot;Great product -works just as claimed!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can remove a few blackheads put but only after hitting the spot several times. I called Panasonic&#x27;s customer service department and spoke to a rep but all she could do is read off her product fact sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of review - It&#x27;s off topic but I think it&#x27;s relevent:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has had any luck with other methods, I would sure love to know about them. Even though I wash my face thoroughly, I still have blackheads around my nose area and just below my eyes. I&#x27;m 55 and I&#x27;ve been dealing with this problem since I was 18. I tried strips, astringents, the black head remover tool, etc without any luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging from the reviews, I discovered that there are many other people with the same frustrating problem. Could we start a web blog or something to share tips, methods, etc? If someone knows how to set it up, it would be great.</li>
    <li> Even when the pours are open (just out of the shower) the suction is only enough to leave red marks on the skin. If the Pour cleanser had more focused suction, it might actually clean the pours out.</li>
    <li> I had the original Panasonic Pore Cleanser from several years back &amp; it worked wonders, I loved it &amp; used it so often that it finally went kaput! So, after some searching I found the new model &amp; I have to say it is a complete disappointment. This piece of trash doesn&#x27;t even come close to its predecessor in overall suction power. I was so excited to use this product that once I received it, knowing that I couldn&#x27;t possibly be disappointed-promptly put the packaging in the recycle bin for pick up that day. What an idiot! After the first disappointing use I rationalized that it must not have gotten a &#x60;full charge&#x27;, so I charged it for a full uninterrupted 48 hours and it still sucks , or I guess I should say it doesn&#x27;t suck!  I know how to properly use this thing, after pores have been opened by steam from your shower, blah...blah...blah. I tried charging it in different electrical outlets in my house, using it in the shower, after my shower, after a steam facial, nothing could make this piece of c**p work. The suction power is abysmal, a complete no-show!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this pore cleanser mainly for my 14 yr old to use since she has a problem with blackheads.  I decided to try it out first so I could show her how to use it properly.  I was disgusted yet fascinated by the amount of goo it sucked off my face.  My daughter had a similar experience.  Both our noses looked better the next morning.  Her blackhead count was visibly lessened.  The only suggestion I would have for panasonic is to figure out a way to make the mist warm water.  It seems counterproductive to me to spray cold water on the face thus closing the very pores you are trying to clean.  The mist is also a little messy but I understand why it is necessary.  I would say that this is worth the money and you should give it a try.</li>
    <li> if i had read the reviews of others experience i would not have bought this useless thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it just didn&#x27;t work. such a small unit doesn&#x27;t seem to have the power or enough suction to suck out blk heads, especially the one caused by serious acne. no matter how long you gonna steam your face, the pore just won&#x27;t open big enough for this thing to obsorb it. you are expecting the blk head leaks out from the pores if you are expecting this product could help you kick out black heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product as it is only an idea, never gonna run into reality</li>
    <li> honestly, I have a lot of blackheads on my nose.. its starting to really bother me therefore, I purchased this pore cleanser. OK, this product doesn&#x27;t take out my blackheads. It does open up my pore and make it easier for me to use a stainless steel blackhead remover to scrub off my blackheads but this suction doesn&#x27;t remove the blackheads. That is why I think its a total waste of money. Let me suggest you all to take a facial steam for 5-10 minutes and then use a metal (professional blackhead remover) and start to scrub off the blackheads. That works much better.</li>
    <li> This Pore Cleanser did not work at all for me.  I even used it right after taking a hot shower.  I don&#x27;t know how some of the other reviewers were getting good results, perhaps it depends on the characteristics of your skin.  I definitely cast my lot with the camp that claims this product is a dud.  It seemed like the suction was pretty weak anyway--too weak to do the work that good ole finger pressure accomplishes.  Anyway, for what it&#x27;s worth, I say don&#x27;t buy this Pore Cleanser.</li>
    <li> I tried it several times right after I got out of the shower. I use the smaller end, and went slowly. It definitely had a good suction, and it felt good, but it did not clean my pores. My pores looked just as clogged after using it, and the vacuum hadn&#x27;t collected any gunk.     However, Amazon made it very easy to return. Shipping was free via USPS. All I needed was a printer for the return mail label. Trying it for yourself will only waste your time, not your money.    (I wish Amazon let me give it zero stars.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy that has never had a problem with my skin, except my nose. The pores on it are always large, black and clogged. I don&#x27;t really worry too much about it so when I came across this device for under 30 bucks I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it. I&#x27;ve used it a total of five or six times now, and the little thing really works well. As others have mentioned, I use it in the shower with the small tip, and spend a few minutes running it briskly back and forth using a little bit of pressure. This thing has completely changed the appearance and feel of my nose. The &#x27;junk&#x27; that it pulls out is amazing. Just when I think I can&#x27;t possible have any more clogged pores I clean the tip and out comes more. I would suggest starting out slowly until you get used to it or it will feel like a sunburn, also don&#x27;t leave it sitting on your skin or you will end up with a cheek hickey(trust me on this one). Not sure how well it works on other areas but for what I&#x27;ve mentioned I highly recommend this little gadget.</li>
    <li> I am Italian with olive oily skin.  Large pore and oil build-up are just second nature to me.  I had never even heard of this product until I randomly found it on Amazon.  I was interested but skeptical.  Given the low price point I decided to throw caution into the wind and take a chance on it.  When it arrived I took it right out of th box and gave it a try, I was amazed.  You could litterally see it pulling the oil right out of your pores!!!!!!  Now I am hooked!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this in combination with the Steam Facial By Kaz (costs $27.75, see my review). I do suspect the mist feature of this Pore Cleanser is not effective, but using it with the great Steam Facial by Kaz, I have had great results! First I steam with the facial steamer for about 20 minutes, then I use the Pore Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The little vacuum does a terrific job sucking icky, waxy  junk out of my pores. The evidence of what was removed is there to see after use, when cleaning up the device. I never had any results using Biore strips, nothing came out of my pores with those. I suspect that the key is to open pores and soften things up with the facial steamer. I would not expect as good results using either the Steamer or the Pore Cleaner alone. The Pore Cleaner is water resistant and may be used directly over steam without damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In total, I spent about $70. and I am very happy with the results. My skin is clearer, the texture is much softer and finer, blackheads are disappearing, pores are growing smaller, and breakouts are far less.</li>
    <li> This may work for some people but it was a waste for me.  I took a hot shower and left a warm towel on my skin before trying this and it still didn&#x27;t work.  The suction was there but even after leaving it on one spot for long periods of time, it didn&#x27;t remove anything.  I could see how it could be effective if it had more power.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I love the feeling of the mist on my face and the vacuuming action.  Don&#x27;t be fooled, this is not going to suck a clogged pore clean, or a blackhead out, but it does suck up the oils and such and leaves you with a nice clean feeling.  The proof is on the adapter that you&#x27;ll want to clean after each use. (easy to clean with a q-tip, I&#x27;ve found)</li>
    <li> One hopes that later models improve on the prior models. Not here.  The old model was bigger and more powerful.  This \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; was advertised to be better than the old model.  That is an out and out lie.  It has about half of the suction power of the model it replaces, and just does not function.</li>
    <li> Ok guys, this is actually a good product if you don&#x27;t follow the instructions included. The proof that this product is working is the rather gross white discharge that accumulates on the nozzle during use. In any case this is how this product should be used. Take a long and steamy shower...emphasis on long and steamy so as to open up those pores. At the end of the shower and while you are still in the shower use the product on your nose trying to maintain the suction as you drag it across the nose from one nostril to another. Repeating this motion and applying a modest amount of pressure will allow for even better results. If you do this correctly the aformentioned discharge will accumulate and your nose will begin to feel smooth. For best results do this once a week. The only side effect is the moderate amount of bruising that can occur from pressing too hard. Trust me this will dissapear in days and can be minimized by adjusting the amount of pressure that you use. I bought two of these about 6 years ago...don&#x27;t ask me why. I must admit one has better suction then the other and I will likely buy another soon because I am always concerned that it might stop being produced because many people are not seeing the results that I am.</li>
    <li> This works well if you follow the directions and have realistic expectations.  I&#x27;m a guy who has had cystic acne since I was in my teens and am in my 40&#x27;s now.  This product uses suction, but is it not a vacuum cleaner.  My acne is under control following two courses of Acutane and since beginning treatment for rosacea (which is ongoing).  Over time, the pores on my nose became pretty prominent.  I use the product 3 times a week immediately after a hot shower.  My face is only exposed to warm water and mild soap.  As directed, I use the large tip for 1 minute and then the small tip for 2 minutes.  I start by slowly \\&quot;sweeping\\&quot; L to R (or R to L) from outside of my nose inward toward the middle, first on one side, then the other.  Then, I go down the middle.  The instructions show how to do this.  I often have time to begin again and redo all areas 1 or more times.  My sports watch has a timer so I don&#x27;t over do.  After I&#x27;m done with my 3 minutes, I rinse and apply my topical rosacea treatment.  As directed, I use this product only on my nose.  Some have dogged the product for not working when used on other areas.  Dogging it for off label use hardly seems fair.  Some reviewers said it works on other areas, and it may, but there may be good reasons for the manufacturers&#x27; recommending use on the nose only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two weeks of 3x per week use, I was amazed at the amount of \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; coming out.  There were still remaining blackheads.  After 2 to 3 weeks, there was little irritation following a treatment, less \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; being removed (because there was less to remove) and my pores began looking \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; and less prominent, with fewer and smaller blackheads (others have noted this too).  Things are not perfect and enlarged pores are not exactly curable, but treatment seems to have resulted in visual improvements enough that I&#x27;m keeping this going for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously nothing works for everybody, and this is not the only tool in my arsenal.  However, it is not a vacuum cleaner or a quick fix.  Some people additionally use the services of aestheticists, who can help with facials to remove stubborn blackheads safely.vacuum cleaner or a quick fix.

    <li> i bought this product for my girlfriend. according to her, this product does its job, however, like others said, it cannot replace strips, and it is good for regular cleaning. so, 80% effective when using it after shower.</li>
    <li> The reviews were kind of mixed on this one, but I decided to give it a try. At first, I was a little disappointed. The mist thing-ridiculously useless. I used it once, for like 10 seconds, and have never used it since. I tried using some of the suggestions of other reviewers, but by about the 3rd use, I found what worked best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, about 3 times a week, as part of my skin care routine. I always use it after a shower on just slightly damp skin. That seems to be the most productive for me. I naturally have very oily skin, especially on my nose. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin seems to produce less oil during the day now. Think I&#x27;m crazy? Well, I used this cleanser last night. Today, I needed to run some errands. I live in AZ-it was 111 and humid today. I washed my face this morning, put on some aloe vera gel, then matte moisturizer, then a primer. I kept it simple with mascara, a dusting of loose powder, a little bronzer, and lip gloss. After being out for 3 hours, my face would normally be a greasy mess, especially on my nose, and I would have had to blot and powder a few times. Today, I came home and checked the mirror-still matte, no shine, no greasiness, no blotting or powdering while I was out. This little pore cleanser has helped me.</li>
    <li> Two quick things: I have been lazy for years(!) about cleansing my skin at night, so I will always have enlarged pores as a result (and if you were crappy about your skin care, you will, too!); and (2) the first, oh, half dozen times I used this thing I used it incorrectly and thought it was a piece of crud (and if you don&#x27;t love the thing, you probably will, too). Phew! Now that those things are out of the way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this will do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you&#x27;ve washed AND exfoliated your face, even if you use this incorrectly it will help, though you won&#x27;t see wonders.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you&#x27;ve done both of those things and are willing to spend time bending over your vanity and staring in the mirror you WILL see this work.&lt;br /&gt;3. It will NOT shrink your enlarged pores (which are enlarged due to your neglect) down to a newborn baby&#x27;s size. Nor the size of a teenager&#x27;s. In fact, the best you can hope for is that they won&#x27;t look scary. But, honestly, if you&#x27;re worried about huge pores then you&#x27;ve got no one to blame but yourself. What, you didn&#x27;t think all that bit about washing your face religiously was about you? Puh-leze.&lt;br /&gt;4. This WILL, if used correctly, both clean out the superficial junk (as in, you won&#x27;t be able to express -- or \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; -- crud out of your pores) and keep your pores from doing the ice-pick, lake-sized thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, here&#x27;s how to use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) For those of you who want to use it OUT of the shower: wash your face using warm water and your favorite cleanser. Rinse at least a half-dozen times. Run a cheap, rough wash cloth under warm water. Hold it against your face until it cools. Now, lightly scrub your face with it. Fill the reservoir of the Panasonic with warm water and splash your face with warm water, too. Next, starting with the big end of the vacuum attachment AND on your largest pore areas move the Panasonic across your face. Do NOT slide it. Do NOT rub it. Do NOT think of this process as running it over your face. Move the dang thing slowly. A count of four is good. A count of ten will probably leave you looking blotchy. So, you know, pick something between that. Oooh, and if you&#x27;ve got good eyesight and can watch yourself in the mirror, YOU WILL SEE IT SUCKING THE SEBUM OUT OF YOUR PORES! Don&#x27;t get carried away. Just do it daily -- at night, ideally -- and eventually your skin will look better than it did before you started neglecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) For those of you who want to use it IN the shower: See above. But don&#x27;t bother filling the tank. Also, you probably don&#x27;t get to watch it suck the crud out of your skin. Pity. That&#x27;s kind of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there&#x27;s the instructions. If it&#x27;s not working for you, then you didn&#x27;t follow them. That&#x27;s not this product&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s yours. Then again, if you were good at following instructions you&#x27;d have followed your mother&#x27;s advice about \\&quot;always wash your makeup off\\&quot; and \\&quot;let your skin breathe\\&quot; and \\&quot;you look better without makeup, darling\\&quot;.good. A count of ten will probably leave you looking blotchy. So, you know, pick something between that.

    <li> Do not buy this piece of garbage. It does NOT do what it claims to do. If you want to clean out your pores, you&#x27;re better off using your own fingers, biore pore strips, or the tweezerman face tool. The only thing this piece of crap will do is give your face hickeys, not clean your pores or anything beneficial. You&#x27;ve got to be an idiot to buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a whim. I am 23 years old with combination skin and the unrealistic wish for microscopic pores. However even with this wish, this product really didn&#x27;t do much except sit on my self. The suction makes rings on your skin but doesn&#x27;t take anything out no matter how much you steam your face. Don&#x27;t waste your money on something that I promise you won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This pore cleaner is wonderful.  I use it in the shower about three times a week.  My pores are large and I look forward to using it when gardening becomes a daily event.  I am hoping that it will help me keep my pores clean.</li>
    <li> It was a huge waste of money. It does not do a thing.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I tried it several times and it barely worked but when I pinched my skin it released all the stuff in my pores</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for the same item, which I purchased ten years ago from Sharper image. I loved it, used it every day,told everyone how great it was. I always thought it&#x27;ll be a sad day when it stops working, Finally, it went the way of all electronic things. I tried for a year to buy a replacement, but no one carried them. Didn&#x27;t thinkink of checking on Amazon until recently. So happy to have a way to clean my pores again!</li>
    <li> i have had it for a few weeks now and use it after i clean my face to get the little stuff. it works great.  i have no brake outs since adding this. the only reason i gave it 4 out of 5 is it loud. if it did not make any noise then a 5 for sure. love that i can charge it too</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK! It did not get out any of my blackheads and I have some big pores, I even tried using it after a shower in a steamy room. There was almost no residue inside the suction cup. Product is a dud!</li>
    <li> i love this product, the way it feels gliding over ones face as it vacuums up the dead skin cells so when one broke (power turns on but it doesnt provide suction), i ordered another and that one broke, with the same problem, within a month.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had this product for about a year and I really like it.  I think it&#x27;s better at removing black heads around the nose area than pore strips or any other products that I&#x27;ve come across.  I use it after I&#x27;ve been in the shower for a while when my pores have opened up.   The reason I subtracted a star from my rating was because, after a while of use, the screen to the suction gets clogged.  I use IPA to de-clog it by placing the suction cup in a cup of IPA and turning it on and then shaking the product to expell the IPA.  To completely dry out the the suction part I have to place it on my radiator over night and usually it ends up working the next day.  Granted I don&#x27;t clean the suction screen properly everyday so that&#x27;s probably why it gets clogged every so often.</li>
    <li> Panasonic Pore Cleanser  [...]    I have been blown away by this pore cleanser.  It is awesome.  It is really difficult to clean pores especially when your face has a tendency to get a little oily.  Pores get clogged and next thing you know you have red dots here and there.  Okay, I shouldn&#x27;t be complaining since I don&#x27;t have major issues.  However, I started to have these issues this year.  Not only that, my pores seemed to get bigger and bigger.  Solution:  get a facial or find another means of cleaning those pores.  Well I opted for the home solution.    First time I used this pore cleanser, it sucked out so much oil and dirt.  I thought my pores would never be cleaned since I had to constantly clean the suction cup.  Second day I used it, there was nothing.  Amazing.  Product is rechargeable and lightweight.  It is easy to use and clean.  It has good suction especially with the mist switch on.  You can&#x27;t leave the device in one spot or you will have redness like the type you get on your neck from your boyfriend or husband.  I was surprised that there wasn&#x27;t that many reviews on this product.  I only found one good review on Youtube so I included a simple one and hope it helps out anybody looking to buy this product.  When I searched for it, most stores had it available only online so I bought it through Amazon $26.73.  I am a satisfied customer and recommend this product to anybody looking to get a deep cleaning on their pores.  [...]</li>
    <li> It does work but it&#x27;s going to take regular use to work everything out. It&#x27;s definitely sucked notable stuff out of the pores on my face each use. It works best if your skin has just been washed in hot water to soften it and open the pores more. I&#x27;ll leave an update of how it&#x27;s working over time...</li>
    <li> While in the shower i use mine on the small opening when i first got it i didnt think it would work. The first time i used it i noticed pores on my face were larger than others, those where the spots i missed. If you let the steam from the shower open up your pores and you use it while your face is moist you will be amazed how much crap comes out. My face got softer, my pores got smaller, and my face started to clear up. I would buy this product again. And its small enough for me to take when i travel. [[ASIN:B0002XG9X2 Panasonic EH2511A Pore Cleanser with Micro-fine Mist]]</li>
    <li> I was hesitant when I ordered this item, because I had tried everything for my extremely deep pores. Tried soaps, and the metal comedone extractor, which just made my nose a giant scab. When the package arrived I used it without the mist, as everyone has recommended. It worked slightly, but when I turned on the mist, I was shocked at how much sebum came out of my pores and into the little deposit areas in the pore cleanser. Did it get the big huge blackheads? No, but it definitely unclogged all of the smaller ones that I cant easily get to on my nose. I expected so much less from this device than I got out of it. You would be amazed at how many clogged pores are on the rest of your face that you cant see. I&#x27;m going to order two more to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and easy to use.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks but I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in my skin (even after the first use).  I can&#x27;t believe I went all these years without one of these! Well worth the price.  The other customer reviews helped in deciding to purchase this &amp; with how to use it.</li>
    <li> Luckily Amazon let me return this piece of junk. Seriously do not even waste your money. I followed the instructions and really had low expectations. This product didn&#x27;t even meet those expectations. Essentially it just scrapped cells off of my skin by moving it over the skin. I can do that with my fingernail but thanks for trying to charge for it!  DO NOT even waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> This works, but not great. The mister is useless. I basically have to stand inside the shower for half an hour until my pores open to use this. Then I have to make multiple circular passes to get something out of my face. It seems to work the best on the forehead and around the mouth, since there is a hard surface behind the skin there. Doing the nose is extremely difficult and it really doesn&#x27;t work because of the shape of your nose. Sadly, there isn&#x27;t much better you can do with an at-home tool than this. It takes way too much time for the entire process of opening your pores and making passes with the tool to do this every day. Maybe once a week.</li>
    <li> What a waste. Doesn&#x27;t work. i got it for my clogged pores (little bumps) and blackheads. DOESN&#x27;T WORK AT ALL ON EITHER. its been sitting in my bathroom drawer just taking up space...very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months ago, hoping it would loosen the extra sebum stored in my pores, particularly my nose and T-zone.    The product looked very convincing and I liked the idea.     I tried it and it hardly removed/loosened the extra sebum in my pores. I even used it after I steamed my face and right after I got out the shower.    Hardly sucked much at all. A negligible amount of sebum was removed, not even as affective as using my fingers wrapped around tissue to push the extra gunk out.    I have dry/combo skin, so probably that might have been a factor to not attaining a fabulous result but the box clearly states it is suitable for all skin types.    I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this.. The suction does not suck. (No pun intended)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it works well. So I ordered my own here on amazon. That was about a month ago and I still haven&#x27;t received my product. This is because it had the wrong address on it and was sent back. I checked and the address on my account is right. I couldn&#x27;t find a costumer service number on this website to call so i called ups and they said they shipped it but the address on the package was missing the last digit of my apartment number. Please help. I would like the product reshipped to me since I&#x27;ve already payed for it.      -Hannah Eisenberg</li>
    <li> Not enough vacuum power to remove any blackheads.  The mister also seemed to stop working after 1 use.  Not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> This product is best to use after you&#x27;ve had a skin peel or microdermabration. You have to wait until all the skin on your face has peeled and then you can use it. It&#x27;s incredible how much junk it sucked from my pores after a skin peel.    If you don&#x27;t have the money or time to have a skin peel or microdermabration you can scrub you face in the shower and then use it while your face is still wet. It won&#x27;t unclog as many pores but it&#x27;s still fairly good. Then I just use a metal pore extractor for any clogged pores it left behind since I don&#x27;t want to use the metal pore extractor for all of my face.    There are three rules I always follow when using this product: 1) always use after a shower 2) always keep my face wet 3) always after I&#x27;ve expoliated my face  By expoliating, there&#x27;s less blocking the suction.    If I don&#x27;t do these three things this product is pretty much useless.  Oh, and I don&#x27;t advice using the big suction cup. The small one is better.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great little tool to have at hand. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I have to say I really see the results as far as smoother complexion and a lot less small bumps and blackheads. It&#x27;s especially great to use in the summer after sweaty days when you feel your pores are clogged from sweat, sunscreen, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I have NOT used the fine mister, b/c frankly it just seemed like too much to deal with. The reservoir is tiny and looks like a pain to fill and keep the level up. Also, it came with a tiny little wand to clean out the spray nozzle and that seems annoying to keep on top with.&lt;br /&gt;I just use this with my face wet, or I use it in the shower. It works fine with your face wet, the mister just seems like an unnecessary add-on. Also, regarding the other reviewers comment about the mister being to close your pores- maybe she has another brand or model? I read every word of my manual and it mentioned nothing about the mister being to close pores. My instructions stated pretty clearly that the mister was used to aid in the wetting of the face to maintain strong suction during use.&lt;br /&gt;I like the little charger stand that comes with it. It&#x27;s easy to plug in and slide the tool into to charge when not in use. The cord is also nice and long, or can be wrapped short.&lt;br /&gt;Take care to listen to the instructions not to use it on sensitive areas of the face or areas where there are currently blemishes. I accidentally made that mistake once and OWWWW!&lt;br /&gt;My only hope is that the battery lasts awhile b/c there is no way to replace the rechargable battery once it dies. The product becomes useless at that point.</li>
    <li> I was spending $125.00 every 4 weeks for an aesthetician to \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; my pores. I don&#x27;t get cystic acne but pore build-up from working out, sweating, wearing make-up and pet grooming all which created hard little bumps under my skin. Sometimes they turned into pimples. and sometimes I would try to extract myself and end up making an open sore on my face. The spa treatments worked beautifully but it got to be expensive and time-consuming. So I simply researched pore vacuum. After lots of review reading I decided on this one. It is AWESOME! I will never go back to the spa. This sits on my counter, it is rechargeable and powerful. My problem area was my chin area. Now I place a hot, damp washcloth over my face to steam open pores for a couple off minutes, then I use this for as long as needed (feels great) and follow up with a salicylic acid toner. you must follow instructions. This does not suck out a pimple, it is intended to gently lift the junk out of the pore which has a cumulative effect. I hope they never stop making this product! I am going to purchase another one to have on hand just in case. You cannot beat the price either. Great product. Great price. Don&#x27;t hesitate in buying this. You will not regret it. I do not understand the 2 star reviews. I give it 10 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to finally clear the blackheads from my nose and chin that have plagued me since my teen years. I agree with the reviewer who said the pore strips work better. The pore cleanser does lift surface dead skin cells and makes my skin feel cleaner. It also helps pull the gunk from pustules. It does not magically pull the plugs out of the pores. It may get one here and there, but overall, it&#x27;s not as thorough as advertised. At least not for me.</li>
    <li> The suction sucks.&lt;br /&gt;In other words it is very weak and useless.&lt;br /&gt;You have to press the device against your face with a considerable amount of force to get the pus out if your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and functions very well.  I do not have many blackheads so I don&#x27;t see much after using it.  However, I have used it on someone with oilier skin and we could see the build up that came out on the tool.  It doesn&#x27;t take very long to use either, which is nice.</li>
    <li> within 2 weeks of my purchase this item stopped working. contacted customer service and was SOL since i had disposed of the box already</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for the past three weeks and it does a decent job.I have noticed tighter, smaller pores and a cleaner and brighter looking skin with consistent use (every three or four days). You must follow the instructions that come with it though and make sure you exfoliate first with a good face scrub before using it.Good product.</li>
    <li> Panasonic Pore Cleanser doesn&#x27;t do much except make your skin red.  I guess it must depend on your skin type</li>
    <li> I love it. However, I wish that the suction was a little stronger. The misting part is a little messy.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product!!!!I have purchased it six months ago and both my husband and I are satisfied and cant get enought of it. I have stopped using any kind of foundation or concealer since I have started using this pore cleanser, eventhough I couldn&#x27;t leave my house without covering my blackheads in the past. I have my old, healthy skin back!!! A friend of mine, who I haven&#x27;t seen me in several months was very surprised the way my skin looks now. She said it is glowing! And I can see that myself!!!   The best way thing to do use it is while you are taking a shower because mister is useless. And you wont see any dramatic results right away, it will take some time but it&#x27;s so worth it.I usually do that at night before I go to bed so I have enough time and get every single pore and when I wake up in the morning my skin feels noticably softer and cleaner.  This may be the best purchase I have ever made. I have spent countless dollars on treatments that never worked and only overdried mt skin. This is what I have been looking for and I am so happy I found it.  They are a lot of people on here saying that the pore cleanser does not do a thing. I think I might&#x27;ve figured out why it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. The reason could be is that your skin is dehydrated. I realized that when after a month of success my cleanser wouldn&#x27;t be getting anything out of my pores no matter how much I steamed my face or how wet my skin was.I couldn&#x27;t understand what it was until I remembered something. A while ago I went to get my facial and an estetitian could not extract any of the blackheads which was very disappointing. She said my skin was extremely dehydrated and pores wouldn&#x27;t open up.The same thing was happening the time I was trying to use Panasonic pore cleanser and  it wouldn&#x27;t do the job. My skin was dehydrated because previously I had run out of my favorite face cream and had to switch to something else I had at home.I could tell it was not moisturizing my skin as much as it needed it be, but I thought it&#x27;d be ok . Well, my skin did not like that and even this wonderful pore cleanser couldn&#x27;t clean out my pores. So I went back to my old cream and the cleanser started performing wonders for me again(just a day after I started using my old cream). So I am pretty sure that&#x27;s the key to having great results with the Panasonic pore cleanser- a well moisturized skin .Btw I think they should put it on a box on something. Hopefully my advise will be helpful to others because it is a truly amazing product and it does work! There is no need for me to be getting facials anymore because now I have my own beauty estetician :)  Just in case if someone is wondering about the cream I use -they are Olay Regenerist deep hydration (day) and Olay Regenerist night recovery (night). This I found are   the most hydrating creams out there and trust me, I tried them all.   Good luck!</li>
    <li> with the suction it creates you would think it would suck out your blackheads but it didn&#x27;t for me. It also irritated my skin more I think.</li>
    <li> i really like the panasonic pore cleanser...i use it daily. it does help me to keep my hands off my face....it also helps to remove the dead and dry skin. I would have given it a 5 but it does not stay charged as long as i would like it too...and i wish it had an extra tip.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. Maybe too high. I make sure I wash my face and get my skin nice and soft before I use it. I do notice a difference in my pores after I have used it. HOWEVER, the results only last about 24 hours. So then I&#x27;m right back where I started. I don&#x27;t have the time to do this every single day. What I had hoped for was that I would notice the difference for a few days to a week, not 24 hours.   So, when I have an event coming up, or a special occasion, that is when I use this product, to give me a little boost in how my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I came across this and it sounded like it would be perfect for getting some annoying blackheads out and making my pores look smaller. Maybe I had too high of expectations, but this product sucked. I have pretty nice skin from the start but this didn&#x27;t seem to do anything but squirt water on my face. This has already made its way into the Goodwill donation pile. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend more on it, but hey, at the very least, the suction does feel kind of cool and more relaxing than anything. It might work for you, but don&#x27;t spend much money on it.</li>
    <li> As with all purchases, I bought this device expecting it to be about half as good as its manufactorer claimed, and about twice as good as its detractors claimed.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works very well, indeed, if used according to the clear instructions sent with it.  I have seen progressive benefits from its use, done with patience, and am very much taken with it.    The people who have lambasted the machine in reviews here have either gone into it expecting instant gratification, or have not taken time to read and heed the method prescribed.  It works over time, as it is advertised to do.  Have patience, and you will be as pleased as I&#x27;ve been.    The Panasonic Pore Cleanser works for me where nothing else has.  Period.</li>
    <li> I gave this product three stars because it seems like something that would work really well for you if you use it correctly and have fairly large pores. For me, though, it just didn&#x27;t seem like it was sucking all that much out. From what I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, if you have LARGER pores that have a lot of sebum/oil clogging them, then this is for you. If you&#x27;re like me and have smaller pores, you might just want to try some Biore pore strips.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment for all the other reviewers but for me, this product is perfect when used in conjunction with a extractor.  I have extremely large pores on my nose.  I used to use the nose strips (which worked perfect) but would leave my nose very red.  Sometimes, I would get deep pimples from using them since they were so effective at removing the blackheads.  That was a problem though so I didn&#x27;t want to go through the pain and possibility of deep infection.  The Panasonic Pore Cleanser is a great alternative.    The way I use it is to first take a nice, warm shower.  After I get out, I wet my nose with warm water on one side and use the pore cleanser to suck away the sebum.  Then I splash some warm water on the other side and do the same.  I don&#x27;t use the micro-fine mist since I have no need to.  Plus, if you use tap water the minerals will clog the machine.  Use distilled water instead.  I then take a \\&quot;extractor\\&quot; and extract the rest of my blackheads that the pore cleanser couldn&#x27;t get.  Remember, the pore cleanser only really gets the surface and not the deep down sebum but it does do a good job loosing your pores so your extractions will be much easier.    After all this happens, I make sure to use a toner to cleanse my nose and put some nice moisturizer on my face.  Do this weekly and you&#x27;ll be very happy with the results. Use rubbing alcohol to clean your pore cleanser and extractor when done.</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and bought the Panasonic Pore Cleanser with Mist. For it to work, you have to steam your face for 10-15 minutes to really open up your pores and soften the oils. The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t do much because I didn&#x27;t steam. But the second time with a good steam, it removed a lot of icky stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works if you have oily skin and use it as instructed! Wish I had bought one sooner!</li>
    <li> Despite following the many helpful user reviews from people who felt this product worked well for them I am still completely unsatisfied.  I&#x27;ve steamed my face, washed it with cleanser, kept the surface moist and all I get with this pathetic little sucker is a little dead skin off the surface.  It does NOT extract any blackhead NOR does it have any effect on a whitehead no matter the size.  The suction is simply too weak on too large of an area even when using the small tip.  Please, save your money.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a cool product to create a spa-like feeling at home....I haven&#x27;t used the mister, but I bought the Conair steamer that was suggested.  The suction is strong and actually works, but only around my nose.  I would rather use Biore strips than have this product taking up space in my house. All-in-all, I could do without it!</li>
    <li> If I could I would give this product zero stars! The first time I used this pore cleanser I used steam on my face for 10 minutes in order to open up my pores.  Then, I used this pore cleanser right after and it didn&#x27;t remove anything at all!  I also tried using it after a hot shower and once again it didn&#x27;t remove anything.  I noticed that using it while your face is wet is not a good idea because the water did not allow this device to have any suction on my skin.  Therefore, I tried patting my face dry and then using it but although there was more suction it didn&#x27;t not clean my pores not even a little bit. I really wanted this device to work but it just didn&#x27;t.  It did cause me to get a few pimples on the area around my nose and I also got two brown spots after using it.  The reason why I got these brown spots is because I tried leaving this device a little longer on my nose to see if this way it would actually suck something out but all it did was leave these brown marks, which went away after a few days.  I have somewhat dry skin so I&#x27;m not sure if this product simply doesn&#x27;t work on anyone or if maybe it only works on people with oily skin.  I was so upset with this device I returned it back to Amazon.  If you want you can check out a review video I did on this product on my youtube channel.  Look me up by my Youtube username which is Lenigirly</li>
    <li> You will be better off with a blackhead remover.[[ASIN:B0017KCPU0 Revlon Stainless Steel Blackhead Remover]]. This item just doesn&#x27;t do much on its own. The only way to get anything with it is to use the head just like a cheap blackhead scraper like the one above. In fact, you will get better performance from the blackhead scraper.    I don&#x27;t know why this thing has positive reviews. My wife tried it too so it&#x27;s not just me.    The only reason it gets 2 stars is because it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve ever seen with built in induction charging, and for the geek in me, that&#x27;s cool.</li>
    <li> I followed instructions &#x3D; No Results, I got creative and steamed my face for a much longer time &#x3D; No Results  This has very weak suction, and the only thing it will suck up is a couple of dead skin cells.  PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON&#x27;T BOTHER WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I had read reviews before I bought this cleanser, so I thought I would give it a chance. I will have to join the people who said \\&quot;no\\&quot; to it. I tried it in the shower, after shower... NOTHING. I think the suction of this cleanser is really weak to do anything. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is pretty cool. The suction is good.</li>
    <li> It will indeed give your face little dark purple marks if you hold it in one place too long, ladies. And you&#x27;ll have to use cover up for at least 2-3 days afterwards, which will increase your chances of getting even more blackheads...  &lt;br /&gt;So does it work? After three weeks of using it 2-3 times per week, I&#x27;m not really sure. The suction cup looks like it&#x27;s taken in a few blackheads(ew! but better there than in my pores...), so it has to be doing something. But when I look at my face, all I can think is that I&#x27;m better off squeezing them with my fingers! &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and even though there&#x27;s a mister, if you fill it up with hot water, it still comes out cold and closes up your pores. Go figure.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes it would help clear up my slightly aging, and definately blemished skin.  As it costs as much as one facial I thought it might be a good investment in clear skin.  I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin so I&#x27;m still thinking about trying a short series of facials.</li>
    <li> Cool- means how it is cool and gross when you see all your pore junk in the end of this neat contraption. Sucky- meaning that it sucks good. Great pressure and the mist is great too. Love It!</li>
    <li> I have never used this product, but i&#x27;m very curious about it.  The directions say that with CONTINUED REGULAR USE you will notice cleaner pores.  Most reviewers are negatively rating this after one or two tries, or once a week use. why?? Is there anyone who has used this regularly who can give a real review? I would love to know if this thing works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this pore cleanser because I was in dire need of something that worked well all the time. My pores have gotten pretty big over the years and the cleansers just seem to get rid of mostly just the surface oils when the problem was deeper. I haven&#x27;t had this long enough for it to have done what I bought it for (making my pores shrink)But it definitely cleans out the pore a lot deeper than any other method I&#x27;ve used before. I am rating this a 4 star only because I&#x27;ve not used it long enough. If it works well enough I will give another comment with a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I use it after my steam facial and fail this cant suction a thing it cant suction a thing is a fail product dont waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cuz the ppl saying is ppl that doesn&#x27;t read the instruction or doesn&#x27;t know how to use it, lame it cant suction a thing &#x3D; this product is a scam at best!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for months now, and it works fabulously. After reading some of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that peope are purchasing this product with the expectation that you&#x27;ll be merrily wooshing away all those nasty plugs in one fell swoop. Read the instructions. This does not replace regular cleansing. It is a supplementary tool to use with your cleansing routine. I use it in the shower, after I&#x27;ve cleansed my face and allowed my pores to open. Once finished, I use the mist function to CLOSE my pores (after all, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s MEANT TO DO).     Taken from the Panasonic FAQs for this product:    6. What does the Mist function do, and how do I use it? (EH2501 only)  The mist cools your skin and closes your pores after you finish treating your skin with the Pore Cleanser.  To use the mist function:  Fill the water tank with water. Turn the suction switch on. Hold the Pore Cleanser about 2 inches away from your face, and press the mist button to spray mist onto your skin. Spray your face with mist for about 10 seconds, and either let dry naturally or gently wipe dry with a soft towel.      In closing, this is a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone who will actually follow the instructions and use it properly.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle machine for the price, but it does about what I expected. Good suction and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product really works!  It removes dead skin with no pain.  Great item and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have skin congestion problem, meaning I get a lot of black heads at my T-Zone and Chin.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this machine will do what it claims, it would have been the best life savor, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t strong enough,&lt;br /&gt;either it was defect or something but It&#x27;s impossible that this poor suction will clear any pores !!&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed,  and shipped it back, if anybody knows of a good way to solve this skin issue, please send me a message !!!!!</li>
    <li> I had one of these and used it all the time.  It stopped working so I ordered this.  It doesn&#x27;t have the suction the original did, so it hardly works.  A good face mask such as Aztec bentonite clay masque, which is a powder and doesn&#x27;t have parabens and extra ingredients that pre-made masques have, works better than this to keep those pores clean.</li>
    <li> My husband has a lot of sebum in the pores of his nose. He was looking for a good way to get it out, besides squeezing. This thing doesn&#x27;t suck hard enough to get it all out.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. Im such a big fan of the laser treatments and pore cleansers that my dermatologist offers so I decided to use this in between sessions. The pore cleanser the dermatologist does is essentially the same idea just suctions the dirt and any blackheads out of your pores. This thing just kinda yanks and tugs on your skin without removing any dirt. I used it for a good couple of weeks trying to get the best results however my skin dosent feel softer or any better than usual. I would suggest if your looking at this product just to skip it. Ill go back to getting my regular treatment at the doctors instead.</li>
    <li> I was too embarrased to return this. The mist thing spits out some water at your face. They should call it \\&quot;the underpowered face vacuum that spits at your face for being an idiot and buying this machine\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately for me this product is not quite worth the price.  I have small but easily clogged pores- this product has a hard time removing/cleaning that.  If you have larger pores I&#x27;m sure this product is fine. I&#x27;m probably going to pass this on to my husband for the pores around his nose.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. Whomever posted that initial review as to how great is probably works for the company. It has no suction really, and the mist is really a little water dripping out every so often. It&#x27;s not at all worth the money, acutally I wouldn&#x27;t take it if they were giving it away. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> not sure what it does... feels kind of cool though. the mist is refreshing. only used it for about a week and now it just sits there.</li>
    <li> I am pretty much just agreeing with everyone else here, but felt the need to post because this product really is one of the more worthless ones that I have purchased in recent memory. You&#x27;re better off sticking with nose strips and the like.  EDIT:  I dug this out and charged it for an experiment. The results were extremely positive: this thing is very good for preparing your nose for using a Biore© nose strip. The sucking action loosens the blackhead material in the pores and, although it is not strong enough to pull them out completely on its own, it does work wonders when coupled with a nose strip.  I would say that this was the most successful nose strip session that I have ever had, and it is completely thanks to the Panasonic pore sucking device thing. Bravo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a pore/blackhead problem for a long time and tried various methods - nose packs, gels, brushes, carbon mud mask etc... A lot of the mask and paste-on products just seem to leave more stuff in the pores than they take out. The nose packs also produces even bigger pores over time. Finally I found about this vacuum suction cleansing machine and decided to give it a try. I think it is fairly priced, and free super saver shipping is nice. It came within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d echo several of the previous reviews regarding the correct way of using this product. It&#x27;s meant for people like me who has oily and productive pores on their nose, not the occasional one or two blackheads. I use it in the shower everyday, pressing the small suction head against the skin on my nose, leaving it on each spot for ~5 sec and move on to the next spot, until the entire nose has been \\&quot;vacuumed\\&quot;. I can see a lot of \\&quot;junk\\&quot; in the rim of the suction head and some \\&quot;blobs\\&quot; on the wall of the suction cup, probably being sucked out of the pores. I clean them with a Q-tip. Since the hot shower and vacuum opens up the pores, I apply an astringent toner right afterward. I don&#x27;t use the \\&quot;mist\\&quot; function since I do the suction in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it daily like this for ~1 month, I started to see changes in my skin. The pores were visibly smaller, and the blackhead were fewer. My nose also started to hold make up and foundation better. Now I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 1 year and I rarely see any blackheads. My nose feel much smoother to the touch and it&#x27;s less oily even in the hot weather. I&#x27;ve stopped using any nose packs or masks. I&#x27;ve decreased the frequency of vacuuming to every two or three days, but I will keep using it to maintain the small pores.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband specially to use in his noise, but for him it doesn´t work. It doesn´t clean anything.  For me it cleans something if I \\&quot;insist\\&quot; many times in a pore.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews I decided to give this product a try.  Used it immediately after a shower, and it really does NOT work very well.  The suction is minimal and it doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads.  I does scrape off a little of the dead skin...but that&#x27;s about all.  I seldom return a product, but after a half dozen uses I boxed it up and sent it back.  Don&#x27;t waste your time/money.</li>
    <li> The suction power is not strong enough to remove any blackheads.  I barely feel the suction on my face, and didn&#x27;t notice any difference after use.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before ordering and have been using it for a few weeks. It does pull out sebum somehow, but it mostly collects on the edges of the suction device and it seems like the suction does help in a way, but I have not seen it actually suck out a plug and collect it on the inside screen. Would I pack it when traveling as a must? I don&#x27;t think I would. I&#x27;d probably bring some Biore strips along with me instead and one of those metal extractor thingies and just try my best with that and a mirror.  A few weeks later, I have only used this a few times since I first reviewed because I bought the Clarisonic Mia and that has been awesome! My pores are smaller and I don&#x27;t have plugs nearly as big as before. I have tried to use the Panasonic pore cleanser after the clarisonic Mia here but it hardly does a thing - I have found that if I just take a hot shower and use an extracting tool by gently dragging along pores, I can extract a lot more sebum than this thing can. It really barely is picking up anything anymore. Maybe my whiteheads are too small or not formed enough. But anyways, it just hasn&#x27;t been working out enough. For example, if this device is extracting the equivalent of an eighth (more like a sixteenth) of a grain of rice of sebum, after a few weeks of using the Clarisonic Mia, hot shower, and basic metal extractor (or the thing that has the loop on the end) along face, I am getting out 2 grains of rice of sebum. Sorry if TMI! I&#x27;m going to see if I can return it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Does not work at all. Total junk. My wife and daughter both tried it with no success at all. Save your hard earned money and take the family out to dinner instead.</li>
    <li> The idea of vacuuming out sebum from pores has been around forever.    Same concept is used at some expensive spas and my ex had an extremely expensive home &#x27;este&#x27; machine that was supposed to do the same thing (along with a couple other things).  I have no idea about spa treatments but I imagine they use a much stronger, more focused vacuum.  This thing works about as well as that beast of a compressor she kept boxed up in the closet for 5 years before dumping it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway this is my experience with the Panny EH2511A.  I&#x27;ve got larger pores and excess sebum in the nose, chin and area between the eyebrows.  I&#x27;m probably guilty of eating too much cheese and protein is what causes it and my T-zone.  Ok ok, not a metrosexual but my ex was the highest maintenance woman you could possibly think of and she hounded me for years to take care of my skin so that&#x27;s where I picked up everything.  I&#x27;ve been using pore strips once a week for years along with washing my face twice daily with a good facial soap and non-clogging moisturizer with good results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But seeing this on Amazon and at a decent price brought up visions of no more paying for strips and waiting around for the thing to dry hoping nobody sees me.  Also somewhat fascinating in a freakish way was the idea of just zoom zoom zoom vacuuming up all that annoying gunk.  I took a long shower, opening up my pores and tried it out.  I used the small end and worked around the trouble areas.  Filled up the mister and used that.  Mister is worthless, even by putting warm water in it.  Just having your nose wet does the same thing as what the mister is supposed to achienve (better seal around the suction cup).  As other&#x27;s point out, it leaves your skin red and irritates it.  As far as sucking out the sebum from the pore, it&#x27;s worthless.  I noticed some stuff in the plastic suction cub to give the illusion that it&#x27;s working at least a little bit but it&#x27;s doing nothing more than just scraping the surfacestuff off with the side of the cup.  You can achieve the same results if you have the thing off or just by gently using a fingernail.  Simply put, it doesn&#x27;t have enough concentrated suction to actually pull the sebum out of the pore.  Tried it again about a week later, same results.    Going back to Amazon and feel foolish for believing it might work.  It belongs on an infomercial. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;FYI don&#x27;t ever, ever use your finger(nails) to pinch your pores.  It damages your skin.           &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m astonished when I hear that somebody has actually has successfully used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my second purchase of a similar product and they simply don&#x27;t work.  I returned it after trying to get rid of my blackheads and make a smoother skin on my nose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re really concerned about your face, forget these so called short-cuts.  Facial is the only thing that&#x27;ll actually help.</li>
    <li> I saw this product being advertised on TV. They were showing the cleanser actually sucking out all the blackheads/sebum/dirt/etc from someone&#x27;s pores. I thought it was amazing.     I found out that someone I knew already bought the cleanser, and she said that it didn&#x27;t work at all. I ordered the Panasonic anyway. Big mistake.    The vacuum on this thing is way too weak to suck out anything from your pores. All it does is irritate your skin, usually leaving red marks that may last over a week.     Don&#x27;t buy this product. It&#x27;s a waste of money and time.    Some of the reviewers made suggestions on how to use it correctly. I tried, but no luck.    One good thing came out of this cleanser though. My brother used it on a pesky pimple on his nose. The Panasonic popped it, and now it&#x27;s gone. According to the instructions, you&#x27;re not supposed to use this on pimples. I guess he was just lucky.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews of this product, I ordered it reluctantly, wondering if I had just wasted my money.  The first time I used it, I followed instructions from another reviewer-making sure the skin was wet, not using the mister, using the small nose cup, etc.  I didn&#x27;t really feel anything, and got out of the shower thinking that I had indeed wasted my money.  I was quite surprised when I looked in the mirror and saw that it had worked!  I now use it every other day and definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> This Product Absolutely 100% works.  Those who posted poor reviews must have great, tiny pores, or didn&#x27;t use this product appropriately.    I researched this like crazy and delayed my purchase for two months, based on skepticism.  The first night I got this, there was some residue in the tip that looked like sebum from my pores.  The next day I used it, (I only use it in the shower, I recommend that HIGHLY) and it removed and UNBELIEVABLE amount of pore clogging sebum.    I&#x27;m a dude with huge pores on my nose, cheeks, and forehead, so maybe it works best on people like me.  I have been squeezing, and Biore stripping my face on occasion my whole life.  NOTHING has ever cleaned out my pores like this product.  I have used it almost daily for the last week and a half.  I think it takes probably a month or more to get all the stuff out of your pores if they are big and clogged.  Your pores adjust to the cleaning and push more sebum to the surface over time.  So each day I use it I get more out, and I can tell the difference in quantity of clogged pores on my face.  On a daily basis there are fewer \\&quot;dark\\&quot; looking pores and some look like empty holes after my shower because this device has absolutely emptied them of sebum.    I also recommend pressing against your face while useing this product.  It&#x27;s too fun to pull your skin up with the suction of it, but I think it functions better with the combination of pressure against your skin, and pore opening moisture from the shower.</li>
    <li> this thing rocks. read the instructions! I recommend cleansing, exfoliating, cleansing and then using it. I use mine in the shower and stand in the warm water while I am using it to keep my pores open. My skin has never been cleaner after 2 weeks of use. but you can&#x27;t just turn it on and expect it to work without at least 5 minutes of steam on very clean skin. The first time I used it my husband commented on how good my skin looked - he thought I had had a facial.</li>
    <li> I first saw this product at The Sharper Image and it caught my eye. I found one here at amazon.com for half as much as the price in the store. I bought it for myslef as a gift to myself for xmas. I got a little worried when I read the review here saying it could only be used on the nose but after reading the intsructions I found it could be used on the whole face. The first time I used it it felt slightly sore while using the pore cleanser. I used it after I got out of the shower and washed my face. It made my skin very soft but afterwords I used Murads toner, liquid exfoliator, and moisturizer and my skin has been great. I only use it once a week but boy does it make my face look and feel clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and I started to use after taking a shower. I could see some whitehead and blackhead coming out.  Unfortunadely, not all white head come out imediately with one stoke. YOu have to give a massage many time in the same area in order to work.  It is also bad to massage the same area many time because the skin will get redness.  I ended up like a vampire because I massage the right side below my lower lips and my skin in that area turn out to become red.  I think, I need more practice in using this product.  I am positive that in the next tries, I will know how to use it better.  The good thing is that I can see my blackheads coming out from my face.  You only need some patience in doing this.  You have to be very careful to not overuse it.  Otherwise, your skin will turn red.</li>
    <li> I used this product a lot at first, hoping for results. I didn&#x27;t really see anything noticeable so it found a place in the cabinet under the sink. My pores aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;large,&amp;#34; but I can tell when they&#x27;re clogged. This product might make more noticeable differences if you have large, noticeable pores. It did make my face feel cleaner, but I&#x27;m not sure if that was just a placebo effect!</li>
    <li> I wish I had one of these 20 years ago! It sure would have helped my self esteem growing up. Once the blackheads are gone (accomplished by using an alternative method such as a blackhead removing tool; this thing doesn&#x27;t actually suck out existing blackheads), KEEP USING IT and you&#x27;ll see that it actually keeps the pores clean and PREVENTS further breakouts! If mine breaks, I will DEFINATELY get another one!</li>
    <li> This may work for someone with very tough skin. When used exactly as directed, it TORE my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful.&lt;br /&gt;Also know that there is a NO RETURNS policy buried deep in &amp;#34;As Good as New&#x27;s&amp;#34; policy.  They will tell you to contact Panasonic, who will tell you that since you didn&#x27;t buy it from Panasonic, they won&#x27;t take it back.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are sure this will work for you, don&#x27;t buy it here!  I made an expensive mistake that I&#x27;m now stuck with.</li>
    <li> This product does not clean your pores out - not at all. If you use it properly, it will only scrape the top layer of your skin off, but you&#x27;ll still keep your black heads...awesome. It also made me break out like crazy; and I usually don&#x27;t break out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t return it so I&#x27;m stuck with this now. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it as a paperweight.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother.  It doesn&#x27;t clean pores so whats the point of even owning it???  I returned mine.</li>
    <li> If this product did not work for you, I am truely sorry! But, for me, this is a miracle!! I highly recommend it based on the following and what type of skin I have.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is oily, and breaks out occasionally but no matter what I do I have blackheads.  I steam and clean it every day. I don&#x27;t wear makeup most days yet the blackhead s are there.&lt;br /&gt;I popped this gadget out of the box ascsoon as I got it, just taking it for a test run. My expectations were not high based on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I was in shock when I turned it on, and after using a few minutes noticed the cap filling with a white/gray goo from my pores. My blackheads were being sucked out. I checked the mirror,  it seemed so. Just to be sure I rinsed the cap out then tried again. Same result. Maybe its because I steam my face often or my skin is so oily that it worked. But it did! Some things to note, the water tank is tricky to fill. Use only filtered water for it to prolong its life. It sprayed me right in the eye first go. It has one suction setting which is more than adequate but is funneled by using the smaller end. The mist definitely helped it stick to my face. In some places it did not stick as well, like my chin, but it worked. You need to move it up or down or in circles to get full effect. I would buy again and if you don&#x27;t like it return it. Also there are knock offs so make sure its panasonic american. I would not buy tge japanese one as it may not fit American outlets  and has not been u.l. tested.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. I purchased this for my 15 and 16 year old daughters. It has not been beneficial at all in clearing up their facial break outs.</li>
    <li> weak! needs to be more power for suction</li>
    <li> Product does nothing to remove blackheads.  As other reviews note, the suction cup is too large.  It did nothing for my skin besides irritate it.  Save your money, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter who is 24 and has had some problems with whiteheads and blackheads especially around the nose area as her skin is quite oily. It has worked extremely well for her and she has recommended it to many of her freinds that have similar issues. She is using it daily and has definately noticed improvement and she has thanked me many times for getting it for her! Good product!</li>
    <li> I use it once a week as my basic skin care after steaming my face or while steaming my face.  The rechargable buttery is still good after 2 years.  The suction head is 2 way.  I can you smaller side or bigger side.  I don&#x27;t use the mist because I always use facial steamer whenever I use this.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t have much expectations for this product.  I started using it while taking a hot shower and it works pretty good.  The suction on your skin was a little painful at first but I am used to it now.  This product works great if you open your pores by putting your face of steam for couple of mins or daily on the shower.  In my case the steam from the shower is not enought to open all my pores but because I use it daily it keeps my pores relatively clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The post before mine is correct, the suction cup is reversible and you can use the bigger side on most of your face and the small side on the hard areas like your nose.</li>
    <li> I find this to be an effective cleansing tool. You will not notice imediate results so don&#x27;t be discouraged by some of the reviews here.  For an effective treatment the face should be thoroughly cleansed, steamed and exfoliated. An at home microdermabrasion treatment is the best but if not, use your regular brand of facial scrub. Exfoliating will get rid of the excess cells sitting on the surface of your skin that prevent the pore from being effectively cleaned. Steaming obviously will help open and soften the pores which will also aid in cleansing. &lt;br /&gt;You may only actually remove the contents of a few pores each time you use it, but you will notice greater skin clarity and you will notice your pores staying clean if you use this regularly.</li>
    <li> Would have donated it, but recycled it instead so another unsuspecting victim wouldn&#x27;t be harmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finally writing reviews on the crappy Panasonic products I&#x27;ve purchased since I had a bad Panasonic &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; experience today - I had called about a defective microwave. The microwave quit working after 13 months of ownership and Panasonic knows that it&#x27;s a common occurrence but still wouldn&#x27;t fix it. I&#x27;m done with them.</li>
    <li> None of these devices work, I have tried a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device does not have enough suction to remove material.  I did read the instructions and follow them.  Took a hot shower to get my pores open yet the device still couldn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For basic black heads the best thing is your fingers. when done correctly it will not damage your skin, nothing will beat what you can do on your own.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine this device even removing a pimple right at the surface which the instructions say not to use it on.</li>
    <li> I had my eye on this product years ago but never got around to buying it.  This product for me cleans better than a blackhead removing strip but is slightly effective as getting a really good spa facial.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews on how this product doesn&#x27;t work, but for me it really does work.  I&#x27;ve had this product a few months now and I use it about once a week or less.  The tip of my nose is much cleaner now and is almost free of blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product could benefit from better instructions.  I&#x27;m going to share how I use this Pore Cleanser.  This product works best right after a shower or bath when my skin is softest.  If I want to use this without taking a shower first, I use a facial humidifier beforehand.  The mister doesn&#x27;t work very well, which is why I didn&#x27;t give this product five stars.  Keeping a moistened towel handy works much better to keep my face from drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to emphasize that just sliding the device over my skin is not enough, I have to actually apply some pressure on my skin with the suction tip for it to work the best.  I would recommend using different types of gentle movements like keeping the tip in place and slightly wiggling the device.  I also try a dabbing motion and a slightly firmer pressing which helps push the blackhead out.  I don&#x27;t do it too hard so as to damage my skin.  When I&#x27;m done, the treated skin will feel kind of swollen and be reddish.  The spa facials that I&#x27;ve had are far more painful and produce more swelling.  Of course this goes away after an hour or so for me.  I also finish with a moisturizer.  The really obvious blackheads can be stubborn at first, but slowly they get removed with consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know my process sounds tedious, but it&#x27;s really not compared to other methods available and using the device itself takes about 10 minutes of my time.  I find this easier than using a pore strip or those metal blackhead removers which are far more painful and don&#x27;t work as well (because they don&#x27;t have the suction!)  I think the convenience of using this product is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside, once again is that the mister doesn&#x27;t function regularly.  Also, maybe I missed it, but this product needs to come with a pipe cleaning type of tool because the removable tip can get kind of gross and I feel like a Q-tip will damage the plastic.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  The product just could be better.(because they don&#x27;t have the suction!)  I think the convenience of using this product is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside, once again is that the mister doesn&#x27;t function regularly.  Also, maybe I missed it, but this product needs to come with a pipe cleaning type of tool because the removable tip can get kind of gross and I feel like a Q-tip will damage the plastic.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  The product just could be better.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the upshot from what I&#x27;ve noticed for me and some others.    +It works best for people with moderate/serious sebum issues.  +It works most effectively on the nose, but can be used elsewhere on the face (with less effect).  +The steaming/warming your face is kinda a double-edged sword.  More steaming &#x3D; more pore opening, but also softer skin susceptible to irritation when the cleanser starts sucking against it.  Be sure to have enough warm water to loosely open your pores though, at the very least.  +Personally I&#x27;ve found a warm 30s to 1min face wash perfectly fine for me.  +Be sure to make your skin moist!  Cleaning your skin will take a few minutes, and I&#x27;ve found that I had to reapply warm water generally a few times.    It ain&#x27;t perfect, but it sure serves me well.</li>
    <li> I tried this Panasonic Pore Cleanser a while ago, and I found it works!  Now I need it wherever I go.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> I have not seen a similar type product like this in the market and it works wonders on my skin. I am so happy that I found this item on Amazon and really love it!</li>
    <li> This thing is absolutely WORTHLESS. My pores are HUGE and I can get over a hundred pore plugs with a Biore strip. I may have cleaned one pore after 5 minutes of trying with this piece of junk.  I returned it. I have no clue why anybody is reviewing this as good. Do yourself a favor and wash your face REGULARLY and use a Biore strip when things get bad.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great idea in theory, but it just didn&#x27;t work at all. It did not remove anything from my skin. I steamed and rinsed with hot water beforehand to no effect. Very Sad.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter who is battling with the issues of clear skin while transforming into adulthood.  First we tried [[ASIN:B0018S8MZ8 Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit]] and that only seemed to irritate her skin and make her nose look red and raw from using the buffer pad.  She has been overall pleased with the results after using the [[ASIN:B0002XG9X2 Panasonic EH2511A Pore Cleanser with Micro-fine Mist]]. Like other reviews have mentioned before, you get better results if you use it in the shower after washing your face with warm water to open your pores.  The misting option really does not have much of a benefit except the col mist does feel good on a hot summer day.  Make sure you keep constant motion because it will cause a red/purple mark on your face if you leave the suction nozzle still in one place for longer than 5 or more seconds.  The instructions state do not hold the application on each spot for more than 10 seconds, but I thought that number was a little high.  Everyone&#x27;s skin tones and blemishes are different, so I guess it depends on the user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a one year limited warranty.  Easy to clean and maintain.  First initial charge is 12 hours but after that it hold the charge for quite a while.  Completely waterproof and best if used in the shower.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really work. It might succeed in drawing some oil out, as evidence by how slick it becomes in between rinsing, but it doesn&#x27;t really get the gunk out of my pores. This unit has been sitting under my sink doing nothing for the past year. I love Panasonic, but try to avoid this product.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. I love it. It works great. You must take your time and do it correctly but it works really good. I live out in the country and we get pretty dirty out here and this is a great way to get those pores cleaned out. Your skin feels great afterword and you can see the difference it makes.</li>
    <li> I read, re-read all the reviews but decided to try it. Basically, I read the directions and did not even attempt to use the mister. I have larger than average pores on my T Zone. If you have average sized pores I can&#x27;t imagine this would work for you. My husband who has average pores said it didn&#x27;t work on him but of course he just put it on dry skin without reading the directions. I used my method on him and it worked great. Here is what I do: I scrub my face with an exfoliant, removing dry skin, and then either in the hot shower (best results) or after a hot compress I use it. You do need to put some pressure on it (the vacuum works best if you put pressure on it as if you were trying to pop out a blackhead with some pressure) and I can see some pores having blackheads removed. Some do not budge so easy... so I use my metal blackhead extractor and then use the vacuum on it. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times per week for 3 weeks and have seen great results. After I&#x27;m done I put glycolic acid  toner (11%) on my face. This closes the pores and will disintegrate any dry or dead skin cells. It&#x27;s not a miracle product but it works for me. I will always struggle with black heads. I bet this would work great in conjunction with proactiv. If you have a few black heads, buy a cheap metal extractor but if you are working on shrinking your pores with weekly/daily maintenance  this is for you. Don&#x27;t forget you need to  use some product to close the pore after and prevent debris/dead skin cells from falling in there again.</li>
    <li> I guess I have the right kind of skin but this thing works wonders.  As said, the mister is pretty much useless - we have alot of minerals in our water so after the first few times, the spray was getting clogged causing less focus and just going all over the place.  The product comes with a tool to clean out the opening but I misplaced it, now it&#x27;s totally clogged.  No biggie, as others have said, just splash some water on your face and you&#x27;re good to go.  The moisture is to just help the seal of the suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at the amount of gunk coming out of my nose and the skin below my eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using the squeeze method all my life and I know that&#x27;s not good for your skin.  I use it pretty much every day and have for about 4 months now.  I used it earlier for the first time in 2 maybe three days, and the amount of gunk that I cleaned out of the nozel was about the size of a large green pea.  YUCK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have problems with blackheads, just the white gunk clogging pores which really isn&#x27;t visible on me until I go squeezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had the bruising problem.  Actually, preferring a model with a more powerful suction would be my only complaint.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will do and the battery in it lasts a VERY long time.  I like the ability to adjust the size.  However, it takes some getting used to suction wise.  But once you get the hang of it, it works great on acne and pores, especially for the nose and chin areas.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> not powerful enough... i just used a couple of time and couldn´t tell a difference... maybe for extremey sensitive skin. save your money.</li>
    <li> I have large pores and followed all the instructions.  The Biore strips work on my skin.  This does not.  Not enough suction.</li>
    <li> I must warn any future buyers.  This item simply does not work.  I bought this product for my daughter for a holiday gift.  When we she went to use it (after a full charge) it simply did not work.  The suction is no where as strong as it needs to be to remove anything from pores, even those not really clogged.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> You have to use it correctly: 1) at the end of a hot shower or 2) after steaming the face for a few minutes. The mist is unnecessary. The trick is to drag it very very slowly over the face--you can feel the suction. I suspect people who think it doesn&#x27;t work are just dragging it over the skin. I&#x27;ve had recurrent blackheads on my nose my entire life--I&#x27;m 44--and finally my blackheads are completely gone. After using it three times, my pores were visibly more refined. After a week, my skin looks like glass. You can see the gunk it&#x27;s sucking up in the vacuum attachment. I find the larger attachment side works better for me--more suction--but the small side works too for creases of the nose. I am so impressed I bought another one for my sister.</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t any suction at all. I followed the directions step by step and it still didnt work. Could be because of me but it just wasnt for me.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  The suction was not very powerful.</li>
    <li> I had tried everything from the owner&#x27;s manual to comments posted here, still never work once. I didn&#x27;t open the box until much later. Think I was our to state after it arrived. Too late to return so after kept trying everything, I just threw it away. An expensive piece of gimmick.</li>
    <li> Unless you have gigantic pores don&#x27;t expect this to work for you. This power is far less than being any useful. It was a waste of money for me. And the Mist thing stopped working within a month.</li>
    <li> I don´t feel it cleans the face pores so good.</li>
    <li> Good pimple and blackhead extraction tool.  I own several extraction tools and this one works extremely well for my needs.  I recommend this tool for easy removal of pimples.</li>
    <li> Be careful. It isn&#x27;t strong enough to pull out building clogs or pimples. It doesn&#x27;t help with ingrown hairs in the sideburns/ beard area. It won&#x27;t pull out any build-up around your nose.    But it WILL give you a hickey in ALL of those places. So when you feel it&#x27;s under-powered and spend more time in an area, you may realize too late that you have a hickey on your face.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what I was thinking.  I had read other reviews, but went ahead and bought it anyway.  Now it just sits in its craddle.  I tryed using it a few times, really did nothing for me.  I should have taken the advice that was posted on other reviews.</li>
    <li> This does absolutely nothing to pull anything out of pores.  Waste of money.  The hole is huge in comparison to pores and all it does is suck onto the skin and doesn&#x27;t target pores.</li>
    <li> I got this one after my old one got really clogged and scally(gross). I had the pevious model(the silver and purple/pink). This model lacks the little button on the side that you would press to increases suction. Instead it uses a switch (wich actually also starts the misting action) to increase the suction from light to only medium. In other words, it has a set limit on suction power whereas on the older model I had full control of the frequency.The little screen is much harder to reach to efficiently clean also. My conclusion is that it still is satisfactory enough to do what it was built for but a step down in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing no matter what I did.Followed the directions to a tee...still did not work.Maybe I got a defective one.It is still in the bathroom drawer.</li>
    <li> This was the second time I bought this product. The first one worked well for many years and I probably would have continued to use it for many more - except my dog thought it would make a very nice chew toy. I think it was much better at getting junk out of my pores and just too expensive to be a chew toy.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very quickly via the mail, and was well packaged and undamaged.   The product sort of does what it is meant to, although the tough little black heads you still have to give a bit of a squeeze after you have used the hand held machine.</li>
    <li> I once bought one of these at the dollar tree for a dollar and that worked better than this one :(    I have returned it to Amazon.    Waiting on my Revlon stainless steel Blackhead remover.</li>
    <li> This  doest work in Spain.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one year ago</li>
    <li> i have had this now for about seven months.  i first began using it every other day, but now find that i only need to use it about once or twice a week.  the suction is surprisingly strong.  i think people who are writing that the suction is too weak are either using it when it is not fully charged or the device is plugged up.  even when i was using it every other day, i found i only needed to charge it about once a month.  when it needed charging, the pump sounded like it was working the same as when fully powered, but suction strength is reduced.  after about six months i thought the device had died on me.  the pump was working, but no suction was happening.  after inspecting it closely, found out that it had become clogged with hard water deposits.  i pulled off the suction attachment and used a wooden toothpick to scrape off the calcium deposits on the fine mesh screen and it worked good as new.  i use this while in the shower after i have washed my face.  i never need to use the misting feature since my face is already wet.  i use the large side first then flip it over to the smaller size and it takes me a few minutes to do my nose, cheekbones and between the eyes.  all the junk is then easily rinsed out of the suction attachment under running water.</li>
    <li> My teenage son loves it</li>
    <li> I purchased this last year after I was delighted to find out that there was a simple (and cheap) way get rid of all those annoying clogged pores/black heads on my nose. Little did I know that the Panasonic EH2511A Pore Cleanser with Micro-fine Mist wasn&#x27;t going to work for me. I thought following the instructions, line for line, that came with the product would suffice, but there&#x27;s prolly something extra required for me and others to do to get good results. I even tried waiting (a lot) longer than recommended to try and get my pores out, but that only made my nose pink and cold (because of having the mist on the entire time). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a while since I tried to use the pore cleanser since I got frustrated this wasn&#x27;t the one stop solution to my clogged pores. Before this I tried Biore Pore Perfect Ultra Deep Cleansing Pore Strips to no avail. I&#x27;ll have to keep looking or do more work to keep my skin toned, or at least get rid of those blackheads.. -,- &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t work for me, so I give it&#x27;s rating a 1 star, w/o considering price. I give it another star for the concept of trying to pull pores out, just that it wasnt strong enough (however if the suction was too strong, it would probably cause more damage than benefit.. i thinks.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t written a review for a product before because I was never inclined to, but I realized how often I look for reviews to products that I&#x27;m interested to buy. Now that I feel like writing one a year later, here&#x27;s one of the few reviews I&#x27;m going to write, even if it&#x27;s too little too late.</li>
    <li> Does ok removing black heads from pores and is a little awkward to maneuver around certain areas without loosing the suction.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. It didn&#x27;t clear a single pore after following the directions and using it in the shower like some others people. Did not have any luck with it.</li>
    <li> I like it helps to clean my face for 30 dollars is good. I used to have before and I knew how to use that product. Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I just used this and can recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the good part was that it worked pretty well to loosen up a lot of the clogged pores. It kinda pulled half of the bad stuff out.  Since it didn&#x27;t fully do the trick, I followed it with a Biore strip, which finished the job.  Usually, a Biore strip works fairly well on me, but leaves a lot of stuff behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From using both together, nothing was left behind. Between the two products, my pores are cleaner than they have ever been.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be a good way to routinely clean my facial pores, however the suction isnt ample enough to do a good job. The misting feature does create a better seal with the suction cup tho, and it does make it a little bit easier. Overall I would just suggest a good facial cleanser and cloth or Biore facial strips.</li>
    <li> Nice idea but not very effective.  The micro fine mist feature on this product worked for only the first few times I used it.  Now even though the product is filled with water, nothing comes out.</li>
    <li> I recived this product about a year ago and I have yet to fall in like with it. The suction is not strong enough, the mist is mimal, your better off using your fingers to unclog your pores then count on this!</li>
    <li> less damaging to the skin then many products time consuming to use best used for long term results will continue using</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t actually work.</li>
    <li> I just bought the Panasonic EH2511A Pore Cleanser with Micro-fine Mist 1 week ago and I am very satisfied with the result. I&#x27;ve only used it twice on my face and I can feel the difference. My face is very smooth and soft.   Some people say that the suction power of this product is not strong enough. I disagree! Since it only has 1 power selection, I had to use the smaller suction tip to have a better contol of the suction. When I used the bigger tip, it left red marks on my face (like hickies) and the marks took 3-4 days to fade away. That&#x27;s how strong the suction power of this machine! Now I know that the smaller tip works very well for me. Slight redness occured after I used the smaller tip but disappeared the next day. By the way, slight redness is an expected and normal reaction to the suction process.  This machine also works best during shower. The warm water in the shower helps open up your pores and keeps your face moist during the suction process which gives a better seal between your face and the suction tip.  And when you use this machine in the shower the mist option is not needed at all.  I hope this review helps. This product is also available at Fry&#x27;s electronics!</li>
    <li> Panasonic EH2511A Pore Cleanser with Micro-fine Mis work great it cleanse whiteheads  and i used to have 2 blackheads in my ear i decided to go to dermatologist because it is really difficult to remove but  this cleanser did the job  AWOSOME</li>
    <li> I bought it, it pulled a few but guess my pores is too deep. I ended buying in addition a blackhead tool for about 7$ and it was fabulous.</li>
    <li> I seems to work.  I use it on my wet face per reviewers instructions.  I think the larger side works better for me, but you should try both sides.  I bought this for my blackheads and I do notice residue in the cup after I am finished.  When I use the pore cleanser my face looks better and I can tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  I gave it three stars because it doesn&#x27;t remove everything right away.  You need to use it daily.  Other than that I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.  The suction is good and it works more or less as advertised.</li>
    <li> I owned a Panasonic Pore Cleanser for years.  I used my first one all the time and because of that I never really had a problem with blackheads.  Pimples from time to time, but hey, natures beauty marks, right?!  Anyways, My cleansers battery died out after years of use and I figured my skin was fairly good and I didn&#x27;t need it anymore.  Wrong!&lt;br /&gt; My nose and cheeks are problem areas. I wear sunglasses a lot and the plastic frames in Southern temps can make a girl sweat.  Combine that with makeup and southern temps and your pores get clogged.  After a couple years I started to see little black dots on my nose and sometimes on my chin.  Sure everyone gets blemishes from time to time, but I was shocked at how no matter what refiners and scrubs I used they just didn&#x27;t go away.  I&#x27;ve used Biore Pore strips and while they take away some of the impurities, I find what they are best at is pulling the micro hairs that grow on you. You look at the strip think \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; but really it&#x27;s not doing much at all.  So I decided to hunt down another Pore Cleanser and found this System.  After using it a couple times my nose is almost spotless.  I can barely see anything left behind.  My cheeks look clearer, and so does my chin.  Some have said that the Mist setting is useless, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;  The trick to this cleanser is use a hot compress on your face for a few minutes, I use the water as warm as I can personally stand it, and I do it a few times before using the cleanser.  Then I start passing it over my trouble areas.  I go slow never leaving it on a spot very long.  As my skin starts to dry I turn on the mist.  What the mist does best, to me, is as your skin starts to dry, it adds enough moisture to keep gliding the wand over your face without making it skip or having to stop and do another compress.  Of course The more you use it over time the more of a difference you will start to see but after just a few times, I vow to not go without another Pore Cleanser again as long as I can help it.&lt;br /&gt;I recently added The [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]]Olay to my regimen of weekly skin care and together my skin has never been softer or look more fresh and dewy.  Must Have For Me.as I can help it.&lt;br /&gt;I recently added The [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]]Olay to my regimen of weekly skin care and together my skin has never been softer or look more fresh and dewy.  Must Have For Me.</li>
    <li> I bought this (Despite reading the low reviews) and I have to admit, I feel as if I just had a facial without leaving my house or dishing out a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first washed my face very well (I use Origin&#x27;s Checks and Balances) and I pat dried my face. I immediately turned on this device and rolled it over my face (nose/chin/cheek/forehead area) as it was sucking away the black heads. I was watching as each of the white/black heads were there one second and then gone the next. My face felt fresh and naked (in a good way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!! IT WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I got this thing and read all the directions, I didn&#x27;t follow them to the T because I read another review that it helped more to keep your face wet with warm water, while the directions say to keep your face dry except the \\&quot;misting\\&quot;. I used this on my boyfriend first because he has A LOT of visible black heads on his nose. I washed his face with [[ASIN:B006QFXROO MelodySusie Multifunction 4-in-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System]] and [[ASIN:B000Q6D3MA Yardley Oatmeal and Almond Bar Soap, 4.25 Ounce]] (I love oatmeal soap, it cleans and gets all the oils off your skin without leaving it feeling dry). I then used this product on his nose. It didn&#x27;t really live up to my expectations. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it because I hope one day it&#x27;ll produce results, but while it got some of the black heads off his nose, it didn&#x27;t really put a \\&quot;dent\\&quot; in the amount. His nose still looks crazy. He then used it on my chin and forehead because that&#x27;s where I get the most black/white heads (this was supposed to be our date night, too, doesn&#x27;t it sound so fun?). Once again, no real visible effect. I actually pushed my nails across my chin like I usually do and got the same amount of pus as I usually did. I&#x27;ve heard this thing can help with getting dead/dry skin off your face, so I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it on my boyfriend because he has really dry skin.</li>
    <li> This does not really help clean out your pores.  I have used it multiple times and I have followed the directions carefully and I only get a tiny bit of anything out of my pores each time I use it.</li>
    <li> Dead on arrival, never had a chance to use it</li>
    <li> It works on my husband because he has larger pores as for myself it doesn&#x27;t really do anything because my pores are very small. the product does work best in the shower for my husband because of the moisture. but it is still a decent product because of the price.</li>
    <li> This is a nice powerful device.  Do not be fooled by it&#x27;s size.  My doctor has a machine that costs more than I make in year to do the same thing.</li>
    <li> i went with the reviews on this one, first off the mist thing is useless, i suffer from black heads and bought a 70 dollar steamer here on amazon. NOW you wanna talk about LOVE .... the steamer helps break up the gunk and the panasonic cleaner just sucks it all up... kinda gross but my skin has not looked better, i suggest using this with a steamer or using a hot towel , to get the best results</li>
    <li> It works very well. Have wanted one for decades. It does exactly what it says it does. Good price. I bught it.</li>
    <li> This item was exactly what I thought it was going to be. It works, and hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!!! I think somebody definitely had the right idea with this product just didn&#x27;t quit hit their target.. Their was just enough suction to make me feel like it  was working but the ending result was the same:( all the black heads were still there</li>
    <li> I had high hopes of finally being able to unclog the very visible pores on my nose with this product but unfortunately, this won&#x27;t be happening.  I read all these reviews and thought I knew where people had gone wrong... but nope... this is just a crappy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The manual says not to let the suction linger over any area to avoid bruising/hickey.... This thing doesn&#x27;t have enough suction for that to be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Upon the second use, the fine mist stopped spraying.  I have not been able to get it back going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the only thing this thing managed to suck up off my face was the loosened, dead skin I scraped up as I pushed the suction cup over my nose.  Absolutely worthless.</li>
    <li> bought this for a christmas present after much hinting. My girlfriend says it works as described and she is happy with the quality of this Panasonic appliance. Good price on Amazon and shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and less than 30 days later it literally just stopped working.  I then had to pay for it to go back to Panasonic as it was less than 30 days later.  They sent me a replacement product which is basically a really good fan with a little bit of suction.  I would send it back again but at this point I am going to spend more returning it then I would have on the product.  When I first got it seemed to work really good especially for the clogged pores around my nose.  But again if you want to buy a product with a short lifespan this is the one you should get otherwise don&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really work out for me, I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and theres no results.&lt;br /&gt;But, it did work for my cousin amazingly. So I guess it depends on the skin type.</li>
    <li> I was extremely hesitant when buying this product, thinking it was probably a waste of money, I am 29 and have dealt with acne since I was 12 or 13. Blackheads have always been a problem for me, no matter what scrub, soap, blah blah I use it hasn&#x27;t cleared up the blackheads. This product is amazing!! Best to use either in the shower or right when you get out so your pores are nice and open, and after you are done don&#x27;t forget to use a toner or ice cube to close your pores back. I have also learned to go over the area a few times and then leave it alone for a day or two, and then try again. If you use it too much for too long your face gets irritated, which is to be expected, however, just a hint</li>
    <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t buy this product.  I bought it a long time ago and just recently was organizing under my bathroom sink and came across it and threw it out.</li>
    <li> Totally not what I expected.  Tried using it several times and it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The young lady that wrote the first review was incorrect. You can use it on your face and nose. In order to use it for your face, you have to turn the plastic suction piece around. It is reversible. Its an effective product.</li>
    <li> I brought this product thinking it would suck up and clear the pores on my face and nose area. Boy!!! Am I disappointed!!! I agree with most of the earlier reviewer it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything besides giving you the feel of a light suction on your skin. Which is not enough to suck out any clogged pores. The one I have runs for about a week and the Mist pump stop working. Which make it useless now.</li>
    <li> Completely pointless to buy. It does not work whatsoever and it will cause you many problems. My capillaries broke and I had this big part of my face all black from blood underneath the skin. And I kept it only few seconds on my face. The skin hurts afterwards. Crappy product. I am going to return the damn thing.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all.  If something seems to good to be true, it usually is.</li>
    <li> First of all, I would like to thank all other reviewers, they helped me to figure out whether to buy this product and what to expect. I am very glad I bought this pore cleanser, it works great! But don&#x27;t expect immediate results (although you might see the effect right away). I started using it everyday for the first 2 weeks, and it doesn&#x27;t take much time or energy at all! And my skin became wonderful! It is much cleaner, smoother and the pores look smaller. One thing I have to say though, I only liked the small side of the suction cup, the large one didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Or may be I just didn&#x27;t figure out how to use it yet... But I highly recommend this product if you have oily or combination skin that breaks out a lot and large pores.</li>
    <li> Save the money, because the product does not work at all. I did put some hopes in it, but I would have been better off, if I had done something else at the time I shopped for this product. I couldn&#x27;t believe a brand like Panasonic would event something so bad. But I was wrong.</li>
    <li> This product is pointless, don&#x27;t waste your money. It doesn&#x27;t do anything significant.  I tried to return it to get my money back but I was past the return date. Invest in a good pore cleansing scrub or Biore pore strips but don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!</li>
    <li> You definitely feel the suction. As long as you don&#x27;t use it too often, I&#x27;m sure it wont irritate your skin. So far, I think that it works quite well. Don&#x27;t stay at one spot for too long. If your white/black heads don&#x27;t get removed on some places don&#x27;t force it - It will come out eventually. Good product, relatively easy to clean, and make sure you air dry the product when you can.</li>
    <li> I am 34 and have oily skin, which used to break out regularly. About 2 years ago my financial situation got better and I started experimenting with buying various products to resolve the issue of my unclear skin once and for all. I have also read a lot of research articles to understand what causes acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I learned, I realized that my skin has two different problems that requires two different treatments. Since my skin is oily, it produces too much sebum, which causes blackheads and whiteheads. This is problem number one. Problem number two is a cause of the first problem. Too much sebum in pores causes acne bacteria grow which leads to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with acne bacteria is easier to resolve than the problem of extra sebum. There are various products that kill acne causing bacteria, from cleansers to creams and lotions. They are all pretty much comparable, but my favorite is Zeno heat treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with extra sebum is not as easily resolved. The best solution I have found before Panasonic pore cleanser was Biore cleansing pads and blackhead strips. But they don&#x27;t even do half of the job that Panasonic does. It is important to learn how to use Panasonic cleanser properly. As one of the previous reviewers stated, it only works after the pores are opened enough with shower or steam, and only with wet skin. It is also important to keep moving the device over the problematic skin and do it several times, as the first time only scrapes dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I have found a regiment that maintains my skin clean. 1. I use panasonic pore cleanser twice or three times a week, and I use Zeno heat treat after each cleansing session, to kill any possible bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be a solution to just using my fingernails to press blackheads out. However the lack of power is so obvious that even after a long hot shower when blackheads are almost popping themselves out it doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s the same as doing nothing. It&#x27;s just ridiculous, apparently was never tested on anyone before releasing.</li>
    <li> great item just as expected very good quality</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see so many negative reviews for this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, the misting option does not work very well and is useless. There is reduced suction when using the narrower side of the nozzle. For these reasons, I give the pore cleaner four stars, instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use the pore cleaner I use it dry, right after I&#x27;ve either washed or steamed my face. I always use the wider side of the nozzle, and run the device in slow, gentle strokes across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To leave it in one place for too long could cause some of the problems (hickeys, etc.) that I&#x27;ve read about in previous reviews. In fact, the instructions that I received with the cleaner discourage leaving the nozzle in a specific area for a lengthy time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing one has to remember is to rinse the device often. If you remove the nozzle, you will see a very small, fine screen not unlike what you see in faucet nozzles. Because the area is so small, any sebum or dead skin that is sucked in there can cause the suction to be reduced, clogging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, enough of explaining how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very delicate, sensitive skin with very small pores... but I can get oily and develop small blackheads in my \\&quot;T-zone.\\&quot; So far, I have had this pore cleaner for a few years and it has worked wonderfully for me... better than the pore strips that leave red welts on my face for hours (I think I&#x27;m allergic to the adhesive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well-built and I have had no problems with it functioning so far.</li>
    <li> Works pretty gd. Always use the face side instead of nose, it provide stronger force.</li>
    <li> A handy product, cleans pore pretty well but not the best. I&#x27;ve never really tried other products so this is the best for me so far!</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads. You&#x27;re much better off using pore cleaning strips. This didn&#x27;t remove anything. Do not waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> For blackheads this works great. Always wash your skin first and leave it wet as you then use. The mist is just not enough. works good on and around the nose</li>
    <li> if it does work for some people that&#x27;s great, but i just don&#x27;t see it... and if i did put in more effort to see some results then i would have to say it was too much effort to justify the effect.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. You do need to open your pores before using, as in any other case, when using such a product. Cam very quick, before specified time, which made me very happy.</li>
    <li> This product works excellent.  I love it and would recommend it. Follow specific instructions and there should be no problem at all with it.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product ever!  I was so excited about trying it to help with my blackheads.  I followed the instructions and tried this 3 times, each time thinking maybe this time it will be different.  Each time I got hickeys on my face.  It was so embarrassing.  I had to wear so much cover up to go out in public.  I will never use it again.</li>
    <li> Before I bought mine I read the reviews and reading the neg ones I thought to myself... They probably just didn&#x27;t use it right... Well.... It really doesn&#x27;t work, I didn&#x27;t e even see any gunk in the cleanser and my black heads and white ones r still in my pores... Lucky it&#x27;s not that expensive but still feel like wasted money</li>
    <li> As previous reviewers wrote, you will need to steam your face prior to using this tool to get it to work properly. Steaming your face for a long enough period will open the pores, and when applying a little pressure with this tool, the clogs will pop out. I use it along with a regular tool extractor as these are the only two products that work in cleaning out my rather large nose pores.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything at all! I&#x27;ve now realised doing the oil cleansing method with almond oil and castor oil removes the black heads!</li>
    <li> I did not trust the reviews of others. However, at the first moment I turned it on, I was really disappointed at the low power that cannot suck any dirt from my pores.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping that I would have a positive experience considering reviews were 50 / 50.  Unfortunately, this product did not work for me.  I fully charged the cleanser, took a hot shower to soften my skin, kept my face wet so it didn&#x27;t dry out and used the cleanser.  Not only did the suction make my face really red (I have sensitive skin) but it did not clean out my pores at all!  I&#x27;m not sure if I just have small pores but I definitely need my pores cleaned from makeup.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to go the old fashion route and get a spa facial.</li>
    <li> The micro-fine mist is more like a squirt gun  and soaks your face with cold water which closes your pores and directly cancels the efforts of taking a hot shower for opening the pores to use this. The suction is weak. I saw absolutely zero difference from using this device. Better off going to the spa for regular facials or use the clarisonic scrub with a salicylic cleanser to keep pores tight and reduce appearance of acne. For blackheads, buy an extractor + rubbing alcohol and do it yourself. Does a far superior job.</li>
    <li> It really does what it says, at least for me. I really really hate squeeze with my fingers and with this i don&#x27;t need to squeeze and the blackheads are gone the same way...</li>
    <li> It works great!  I wish the suction was more powerful though since my pore is big and deep.  It does suck up the oil and make up that&#x27;s left behind in your pores.  Sometimes surprise amounts of it come out so it does the job!</li>
    <li> This device worked great for about 4 weeks then the suction failed.  I cleaned cone and device.  Used 3 to 4 times per week for a total use of 12 to 15 times before it stopped working.</li>
    <li> First of all, on a positive note, let me just say, that Amazon makes it SO easy to make returns now.&lt;br /&gt;They gave me my money back right away and even sent a UPS driver with a return label in hand, to my house,&lt;br /&gt;to pick up the package for return, now THAT is service!&lt;br /&gt;So I love Amazon and will always buy from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product, however, is disappointing.  I followed the instructions that the customers who like the product left.  I tried this pore cleanser in the steamy shower, in the steamy bathroom, I tried it once after I properly steamed my face with a product which does that.&lt;br /&gt;I tried both sides, and while I did get a proper suction 98% of the time, I got ZERO results.&lt;br /&gt;There was never ANYTHING, and I mean nothing in the suction cups (or whatever you want to call them).&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I take good care of my skin, I have suffered with enlarged pores for years,&lt;br /&gt;and was hoping that this would help get the black sebum out of them, or at least open them up more.&lt;br /&gt;All I noticed was red irritated skin from the suction.  Nothing whatsoever was removed or sucked out.&lt;br /&gt;I had a few black heads, and always have MANY enlarged pores all over my nose, spreading to my cheek area, my forehead and chin.&lt;br /&gt;I use a cleanser, toner, moisturizer, facil polish (scrub) and a rose clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that is why this product didn&#x27; work for me, becuse I keep my face&lt;br /&gt;very very clean.  And for some reason all of those clogged pores on my face will just&lt;br /&gt;NOT budge.&lt;br /&gt;I have had some luck with Biore pore strips, though nothing outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;And the best results I have had is with Microdermabrasion, which is a spa service and very&lt;br /&gt;expensive.  So I guess I got my hopes up, that this might help.&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps for people who don&#x27;t spend much time using skin care products on a regular basis,&lt;br /&gt;it helps.  But if you are like me, and use proper facial care techniques morning and night,&lt;br /&gt;and plenty of excellent products. (I use MD Formulations and it does help).&lt;br /&gt; I hate to tell you that you will probably not see any results.</li>
    <li> People who are saying this doesn&#x27;t work are probably using it the wrong way or being impatient. I have to take my time, take a steamy shower and use a pore de clogging mask once a week.  But with all of this together, I have noticed how my pores have been growing smaller and I have been getting less acne!! Remember to keep your face WET while you are doing it and making sure the cup is providing suction.&lt;br /&gt;I use the big tip mostly, because the little one doesn&#x27;t really seem to do it for me. And the mister is useless...but!&lt;br /&gt;Use this product correctly, be persistent and patient, and you will see results!</li>
    <li> Money wasted. Ended up in garbage. Weak- does not do a job at all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference in my pores. Waste of money. Go to the spa and have your pores extracted. This item does not have the suction to do anything and the water squirter clogs up. Not a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Was used &amp;#34;correctly&amp;#34; and was just a total waste of money.  Not worth even your time much less money.  BEWARE!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product for the money. It could have a little more suction but all in all this is a great product for the money and it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> not so good........  I give it an C- but it looks good!  not a go to gadget but might help you.</li>
    <li> this product works very well. It does exactly what I was hoping that it would do. It cannot actually shrink your pores, because that is predetermined. It does make them less visible, because it removes blackheads that you see on your nose.  I could actually see the sebum being sucked out of my pores!  Ick!  A bonus for me is that it was not painful like having extraction when I go for a facial.&lt;br /&gt;I have rite-aid knock off of the clarisonic exfoliation brush, and this cleans the surface of my skin.  The Panasonic is then able to remove blackheads way better than any nose strips I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m excited to have such clean pores.&lt;br /&gt; As other reviewers have described, it must be used as directed. I found that it worked well after holding a warm wet washcloth over my nose and chin for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt; The function of the mister part of this product is to help the suction adhere to your skin, not on like when you lick a suction cup before sticking it to glass.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it can cause a hickey-like mark that lasts about 10 minutes if you keep it in one place too long.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve tried this a few times now and I must say, I&#x27;m not quite sure it does much of anything at all except irritate my skin.  I&#x27;ve got very sensitive oily skin and even had a few blackheads the first time I used this, and not only did it do absolutely nothing for the blackheads, it actually wound up making be break out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit on the fence about trying this again.  I seem to do alright with my usual regimen and would rather not cause another breakout.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with very sensitive skin as even on a wet face, it will irritate.</li>
    <li> Top of enough to suck black heads.from.ears only.. did nothing to the blackheads on the face.</li>
    <li> This product did no work anywhere near as well as expected. the suction was horrible so it was not worth the money I spent for it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;m a fan of anything that makes my face feel clean and this does just that. It feels like it removes a lot of impurities from your face, which is especially great if you wear makeup because you don&#x27;t want that stuff on your face for too long. I don&#x27;t usually use the mist, I just use it in the shower so it&#x27;s unnecessary.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me to cleanse pores on my face. Followed the instructions exactly and made sure it was fully charged. Just did not seem like it was doing much of anything. Tried it many times with same results.</li>
    <li> I have lots of black head and don&#x27;t have any good plans to clean , then I think this should be a good choice to clean.</li>
    <li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews that said this doesn&#x27;t work. The suction just isn&#x27;t powerful enough to clean out your pores. It doesn&#x27;t even get the water drops left by steaming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased overall with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s removing much sebum, although I do find some in the suction cup attachment.  I have noticed my skin is much clearer, though, with no other changes in my skin care regimen, so it must be doing something.</li>
    <li> I purchased a facial steamer along with this to help keep my pores open and face wet while using this product. I used this several times, and with the steamer got my skin hot and wet, but this product does absolutely nothing. As far as other users saying it needs good grip to get the right amount of suction, I had this thing pulling my skin up into the small opening, but nothing cleaned out of my pores. Get a good cleaner, a soft facial brush, and the mud masks (that you mix from a powder) to get your pores clean. I did keep my steamer because I loved the way it softens your skin and helps with absorbing lotions. This is garbage.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately didn&#x27;t open package immediately and try. Now it&#x27;s too late to return. Does absolutly nothing to remove anything from even pre-steamed skin. Suction is incredibly weak! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
    <li> Decided to try product b/c I didn&#x27;t need an exfoliator, just something to help clear pore issues especially on my nose &amp; between the eyebrows on my forehead.  After first use, I did notice the difference on my nose. It appeared cleaner &amp; you can see the residue on the suction cups.  Be careful not to hold in one spot too long-it may result in some broken capillaries.  You must keep it moving along.  I used it without the mist option-just kept face moist with water on the areas I was working on.</li>
    <li> after using it a few times, yes it does seem to pull some stuff from the pores, however you could do the same with a hot wash cloth and gently rubbing anything flat over the surface of your skin, about the same amount of gunk is gently pulled up with this pressure.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. hardly has any suction. did not live up to the claims and the water sprayer did not work again after the first use.</li>
    <li> After receiving this product I was eager to try it out, as I have congested pores. First off the suction is very weak and it can&#x27;t suck anything out. Maybe this is for skin that isn&#x27;t acne-prone or oily or congested. Mine is all of the above so I was expecting some sort of difference based on other reviews. This doesn&#x27;t work for my skin-type. It was a waste of money and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone w/ the same skin-type as mine.</li>
