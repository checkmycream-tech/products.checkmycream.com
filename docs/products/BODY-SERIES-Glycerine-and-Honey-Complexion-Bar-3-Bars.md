    <li> the ingredients are not posted, at least I could not find them. This product is NOT pure glycerine or anything close to it.&lt;br /&gt;And the scent is awful. I hated it.. Could not get it out of the bathroom fast enough. YUK&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for simple clean glycerine soap. This is NOT that...</li>
    <li> Its a soap that just glides over your skin.I mean it is so soft that you wonder if it can actually be a soap. It leaves your skin soft and supple.It has got a very good scent to it,nothing revolutionary though. I have used other brands with honey and glycerine,but this one beats all of them.It is quite expensive but its an Amway product.they are worth every penny</li>
    <li> Had a soap of just glycerine and honey years ago. Was really excited that this one says that it had only those ingredients and under someones review they stated it didn&#x27;t have other ingredients.  I received this product today.  It states : sodium tallowate, sodium cocate, water/eau , alcohol denat, glycerin, sucrose, sodium sterate FRAGRANCE/ PARFUM!!! Honey/Mel,  pentasodium penetrate , tetra sodium, etidronate , yellow 5 and red 33.</li>
    <li> A few things to consider before purchasing this item:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- While the soap does a great job lifting dirt and oil it left my skin feeling tight and visibly dry.  If you&#x27;re purchasing a glycerine soap to help fight oily skin this soap may take you a bit too far in the opposite direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This is probably not a great soap for women since it has a masculine scent, a cross between English Leather and Old Spice -- and it lingers all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I hadn&#x27;t realized that this was an Amway product.  Had I known it&#x27;s unlikely I would have purchased it knowing that skincare products is not really their thing.</li>
    <li> Best soap . Gives a real clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Lovely, delicately scented bars. Surprisingly, the scent lingers on the skin and leaves it baby-soft.</li>
    <li> My skin feels cleaner using this soap. I have been using it for years and love it!</li>
    <li> excellent item, works very good!</li>
    <li> excellent service,love the soap</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I found this fabulous product at Amazon again.  I love the smell, texture and how my face feels after using it.</li>
    <li> This soap is mild, gentle, pleasant, and pleasing to the nose! It cleans skin and rinses completely. There is not another soap on the market that can claim this. The lather is easily attained, yet simple to wash away, leaving the skin smooth and slippery, with no soap residue.</li>
    <li> Never mind the dermatologist and the cost of creams, ointments, etc. that they prescribe that don&#x27;t work half the time. Use this soap on your whole body. Has helped my son, who is now 40, who gets eczema flare ups (swimming in chlorinated pools, cold dry weather, etc) and he goes back to using this soap and it clears up. I love it as it leaves your skin feeling so smooth. Great product for years</li>
    <li> On time delivery. The soap is really good. But finished so fast. But it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever I will definitely recommend&lt;br /&gt;body and face</li>
    <li> They tried to deliever it at a time not home.Only tried once,ask for redelivery.Not happening.Had to go way out way.First time this one.Think??it make me too dry&amp;itche.Will stop use.The cost kinda high for just some unknown soap.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 17 years. I can&#x27;t think of a better soap bar than this.</li>
    <li> Have used this soap for years.  It does not dry out my skin as some soaps.&lt;br /&gt;Very glad I found it again on Amazon.  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Item as described fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love it.its help also with my pimbles</li>
    <li> Good for our skin leaving an smooth sensation in the whole body.An excellent daily moisturizing for our face because my family and myself like to take care of our skin.</li>
