      <li>my hair is smooth, straight, and shiny.</li>
      <li>I use the product to help my hair smooth, soft and frizz free.</li>
      <li>so I use it pretty sparingly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for people with coarse thick hair.</li>
      <li>and I still have a good amount left even though I use it daily.</li>
      <li>I had used this a few years ago and it was amazing.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really improve the condition of my hair as much as I hoped it would.</li>

      <li>and it makes my hair shine and feel so soft.</li>
      <li>I only use just a few drops and it&#x27;s like magic -</li>
      <li>On top of how well it works, even with my long hair, I only need about half a dropper (a whole dropper amount would make the hair near my scalp greasy), so the last bottle I had lasted me over a year.</li>
      <li>I have long, colored, naturally wavy hair, but I prefer to wear it straight, so I blow-dry after each washing.</li>
      <li>It helps keep the ends of my hair from being dry or frizzy, which is important, because my hair is down to my butt, and it especially needs extra care.</li>

<li> This time I am not sure what is different but it does not do the same thing.  </li>

    <li> Perfect for frizzy hair like mine</li>
    <li> I&lt;br /&gt;Love. Hello I reordered</li>
    <li> the very best for fly-aways and for split ends....&lt;br /&gt;truly miraculous....all ojon products are i would never use anything else</li>
    <li> I am using everyday a drop and I love it already to order one more</li>
    <li> I have been using this a long time. Worked well when I dyed my hair and just as well now that I don&#x60;t.</li>
    <li> The product is perfect for any woman&#x27;s hair that has bad frizz and show split ends. My hair always dry, frizz and brittle. I use the product to help my hair smooth, soft and frizz free. I use the product for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been trying to find it all over the place and of course Amazon has it. If you have ve dry dull hair, Ojon is for you and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair an oily mess.</li>
    <li> This has saved my hair!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have ever bought. I have long, colored, naturally wavy hair, but I prefer to wear it straight, so I blow-dry after each washing. This product makes my hair so flat and shiny and keeps the frizz down, as if I had flat-ironed my hair except without losing the softness (my hair always feels stiff and fried from a flat iron). On top of how well it works, even with my long hair, I only need about half a dropper (a whole dropper amount would make the hair near my scalp greasy), so the last bottle I had lasted me over a year. Literally can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product!</li>
    <li> I really like this hair serum. Just make sure you don&#x27;t put too much of it on, because it can make your hair look greasy and feel pretty heavy. Definitely helps smooth dry hair.</li>
    <li> The Ojon Damage Reverse serum claims to repair and restore dry, damaged hair. I remembered seeing this at Sephora and I was like...MUST. HAVE!!!! :) So I ended up buying the full sized bottle sometime last year. I use this about once a week with towel dried hair. It&#x27;s quite rich and oily so I use it pretty sparingly. It&#x27;s perfect for people with coarse thick hair. Definitely would not recommend it to anyone with fine hair because it really weighs hair down. Scent is really nice. Something of lavenders. Very herbal-ish. I like.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> I had used this a few years ago and it was amazing.  This time I am not sure what is different but it does not do the same thing.  I put it on my hair and it just is gone but doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel shinny or better.  It is strange maybe they changed the formula?</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It helps keep the ends of my hair from being dry or frizzy, which is important, because my hair is down to my butt, and it especially needs extra care. It has brought the health back to my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a beauty store alongside with the restorative hair treatment. The hair treatment did nothing for my hair but this serum works great! I can feel the difference the moment I apply it to my hair after a shower and I love the \\&quot;Earthly\\&quot; smell it has. It keeps my hair from frizzing when I blow dry it and it makes my hair shine and feel so soft. I only use just a few drops and it&#x27;s like magic - my hair is smooth, straight, and shiny. I bought the bottle 2 months ago and I still have a good amount left even though I use it daily. I will continue to use this product as a daily routine in my hair care.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It moisturizes so well and leaves my hair shiny and silky without weighing it down! Perfect to use when I flat-iron to give added protection!</li>
    <li> I used this product and this serum did not give me the results I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;I would mix other products with the serum to achieve better hydration and moisture.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I should have been extremely pleased.....not...&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could return but will use it as stated above...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really improve the condition of my hair as much as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product I have been using it for about a month now and it has proven very effective.  Came quickly too.</li>
    <li> very happy and healthy hair and love the product it change my whole attitude when you have happy hair yoour more happy about yourself!! : )</li>
