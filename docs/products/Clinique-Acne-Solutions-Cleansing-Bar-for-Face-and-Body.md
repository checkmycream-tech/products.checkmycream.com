    <li> This really cleans my face and has helped me with acne but it kind of dries your face.</li>
    <li> I was buying this for more money from Macy&#x27;s and it&#x27;s the exact soap I used before just less money!!!</li>
    <li> While I no longer have acne, my face gets very oily at times. This soap has helped quite a bit. My skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated as with other products. Also, the bar last forever. I will definitely try other Clinique products even though I expect to continue to buy this one.</li>
    <li> This product did not work on acne. It is also overlypriced.</li>
    <li> Started using this cleansing bar on my face where most of my acne is located.  I feel like this bar takes all the impurities away from my skin leaving nothing but healthy feel good skin.  It comes with a great storage container and I think it will last a good amount of time.  Product came fast.  Will definitely have to stock up on this cleansing bar.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, I can see a change in my face. I would recommend this to people that have had trouble with acne &amp; nothing has worked. This has worked for me I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now</li>
    <li> I have battled acne six I was 16, and I am still battling acne.  I bought the entire system for Clinique, and it worked for a couple of weeks, but stopped.  i believe that my skin built up a tolerance to it.  Now, I am searching for something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for five months now since I&#x27;ve been using the one my husband bought before I purchased mine. I must say that I cannot get my head around how this soap managed to clear up my horrible blemishes. I am so very proud of my beautiful skin thanks to this one bar of magic. Nothing worked for me not even proactive until I tried this soap. One more thing, before purchasing you must understand the sensitivity of your skin and buy accordingly.</li>
    <li> Clinique is fantastic</li>
    <li> I love the Clinique Acne Solutions product line.  I am woman in my 40&#x27;s that has suffered from breakouts my entire life.  Started using this product line 6 months ago and my skin has never felt or looked better.  I hate going to the mall to buy my Clinique so I decided to buy online.  This was my first time buying from this retailer and it was a great experience.  The product was in the original packaging and arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.. It makes my skin feel very clean, and it has dramatically reduced the spots on my face.</li>
    <li> Please listen when I say this works!! I use it everyday on my face in the morning. It will not dry out your skin and worked for my off and on again acne problems. The bar is a great size also</li>
    <li> I really love this soap! I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now, and I can see the difference in my skin. It really helps me control my breakouts. My skin feels and looks softer and brighter, and my old acnes spots seem less noticeable. I also like that the scent is very light.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE This product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it. She doesn&#x27;t even have acne but she likes to use this soap.</li>
    <li> This really helped clear my skin in just a couple of days!</li>
    <li> Excellent..as expected</li>
