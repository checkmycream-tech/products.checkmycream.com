      <li>love it :D</li>
      <li>Excellent quality and functionality at what i feel to be an appropriate price.</li>
      <li>My experience with Panasonic epilators is that they are excellent products, and if you can stand using a good epilator under your arms you will be able to use one on your whiskers, ladies.</li>
      <li>P one had good reviews.</li>
      <li>Attended my expectations, it&#x27;s a really good product</li>
      <li>This epilator is so much better and with the two rollers it does an incredible job.</li>

      <li>The Phillips still worked while plugged in, which was good because the charge always ran out before I was done with both legs and underarms.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She is really good with pain tolerance, so that is not an issue.</li>
      <li>My wife got a really good deal for $54.99 when it was on sale.</li>
      <li>It is also good under arm.  </li>
      <li>hope you have a good experience with it too</li>
      <li>My advice is to either stick to waxing or get a good quality razor.</li>
      <li>It does a good job at separating the whiskers from my face and not my skin from my face.  </li>
      <li>Good call, honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>in the shower feels like you did a good job</li>
      <li>The bikini area is good, too.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found little painful.. but I am happy with the product</li>
    <li> DOES NOT DO A GOOD JOB AT ALL</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. It is soo easy to use and it takes out every since hair. I especially love how it comes with different heads. Plus, my hairs don&#x27;t even grow back super thick anymore. It&#x27;s growing slower and lighter and sparse. It is soo worth it</li>
    <li> Thought I liked it at first, but after using it a couple of times, it stopped working as well as it did the first time.  The shaver leaves way too many hairs uncut.  You really have to work at getting the shave.  The epilator part is also just so so now.  The first time I used it I thought it was pretty okay and was thrilled with the combo and cost.  I thought I got a great product for a great deal compared to others I looked into.  Well, hold on, just know that it looks really great, but it really doesn&#x27;t function all that great.  I&#x27;ve gone back to using my manual shaver just as often as using this one.  And the epilator?  well, I think that was a waste since I still have to go through and look for hair and shave after do it.  I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m not quite fully ready to say &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; yet.</li>
    <li> The whole set is well made, well thought out and easy to use and care for. I never used my first one in the shower but I did use all of the different heads on a regular basis. The only reason I&#x27;m ordering another is I&#x27;ve about used the first one up! The bigger head is good for all over, the small head for upper lip, and the shaver head for whatever you wish. The pumice head for callouses is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first time using an epilator use the &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; head shield to help you get used to the slight stinging for newbies. It doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to it if you don&#x27;t let the sting stop you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for epilation. It really is a viable alternative to shaving, chemicals, or waxing. There&#x27;s also no burning. It&#x27;s a lot better!</li>
    <li> It made my skin hurt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it 3 months and the blades are already dull.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery. I am very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> A good product.  There is a little pain but as all products like this do have.  It&#x27;s easy to hold and works great in shower  The stone for feet is worth the entire price!!!</li>
    <li> As always the product works great and it arrived in fast fashion even during Christmas rush time for mailings</li>
    <li> If you can get past the initial discomfort (well, okay, pain) this is the way to go. I had middle-aged (menopausal) facial hair and was having to shave my chin every other day. I got tired of monitoring and maintaining! Once the sturdy, established hair has been yanked out by the epilator, it is followed by soft hair which comes out much more easily. I&#x27;m down to using it every 10 days for the remaining stray hairs and my chin feels soft. I&#x27;ve used it on my upper lip, with its millions of nerve endings, and have to numb the area with ice beforehand. On my legs the sensation is completely manageable and they stay soft and smooth for weeks without having to treat agan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the epilator head--which works great for me.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little painful the first time you use it because all follicles have grown hair past the surface of the skin.  But not so painful that I couldn&#x27;t do both legs, top to bottom, in one session.  The hair doesn&#x27;t all grow back at the same time, so subsequent uses aren&#x27;t painful at all.  The charge lasts a long time.  I recharge after every 2-3 uses, but I&#x27;ve yet to have the battery go dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use it on my knees and ankle area, though the manufacturer says specifically not to.  Just make sure your skin is stretched tight.  I bend my knee all the way to do the front of my knee, the straighten my leg to do the sides and back of the knee.  It will try to eat loose skin.  If it does, don&#x27;t panic, just shut it off.  Then you can pull it off the skin.  I&#x27;ve not broken any skin from it in the 6+ months I&#x27;ve owned it, and I&#x27;m 57 with thin skin from decades of prednisone use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I got this electric epilator, I only used a razor in the shower.  If I skipped a day, within 36 hours I&#x27;d be going nuts... the hair stubs rubbing against my pants or sheets drove me to get up and jump in the shower just to shave my legs.  Now I use the epilator every two to three days, and have yet gotten to the &amp;#34;I have to shave my legs now!&amp;#34; point.  And it&#x27;s so quick.  Also, the growth at the 2-3 day mark is very fine and sparse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I love it and wish they&#x27;d made this 40 years ago.  ;-)</li>
    <li> Ok, this thing is really painful at first. I&#x27;m pretty tough so I thought I could handle it...my first session I did ankle to knee on one leg and it took 45 minutes.  Needless to say it took at least a week for me to finish my legs. I think once you get the worst of it over with it&#x27;s not nearly as painful on the upkeep. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the hair grows back slower or finer or what. Anyhow, I can shave twice a day and still not have smooth legs but after using this my legs have stayed pretty smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it once or twice a week just to make sure i keep up with new hair growth. If you use it in the shower be sure to use it with some kind of shower gel because it moves a lot smother.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is impressed. This is much easier and more pleasant to use than an Epilady.</li>
    <li> A few words of advice after using this for a few months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the pumice foot scrubbing head - I would use this DRY - it seems to be more effective that way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the legs, I just discovered this amazing trick to lessen the pain - I used to do it in the shower with the water hitting my back, but I just realised if you direct the shower stream RIGHT on to the area you are removing hair from, it really doesn&#x27;t hurt as much... It is by no means pleasurable, but I think the force of the spray kind of distracts the nerves or something (hardly medical research!)... and you can barely see anything but the tweezing things seem to find the hairs. When I do the tops of my thighs I use one hand to hold the skin taut and have the water spray there &amp; do the epilating over it and it is way less painful. For other areas I have been holding the shower head in my hand and doing it that way....</li>
    <li> Works great! There is nothing that I don&#x27;t like about it. The best epilator I could buy.</li>
    <li> Great product! Painful, but definitely bearable! But do not do your bikini line!!!!! If you do, exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate! You don&#x27;t want ingrown hair there!</li>
    <li> Bought this one after reading reviews on multiple epilators. I&#x27;m not sure how it stands up to other brands as this is the only one I have tried but I liked the results so much that I turned around and ordered one to give my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I got this is for my arm pits. Shaving gives me bad ingrown hairs there and with fast growing black body hair I had a perpetual five o&#x27;clock shadow. I started waxing several years ago but had to wax weekly and I have trouble finding time to dedicate to it. This is great because you can do a quick run over before wearing something sleeveless or leg baring to catch any strays or new growth since the last time. My skin itself is not as soft as after waxing but it&#x27;s not red and tender either so I don&#x27;t mind and follow up with a good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS painful but not excruciating. It&#x27;s like tiny little electric zaps. To me, totally worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and works great. A bit painful, but worth not having to shave everyday.</li>
    <li> Great product! I bought one for me and one as a gift for my daughter. We both love it. Smooth skin, crack free feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great safety feature: It doesn&#x27;t operate while plugged into the electrical outlet. It says it&#x27;s a wet/dry device so I could see how SOMEONE could make the fatal mistake of using it in the tub, cord and all. Nope. Not ok. Unplug first.</li>
    <li> Not the product, the wife did not want to use it. Amazon&#x27;s return policy is very easy. Took no time before the money was back in our account. Product looks great, that&#x27;s why I bought it for her.</li>
    <li> I received this today and was excited to try it. This is my second epilator. I bought a Braun SE 5180 2 years ago and loved it decided to get a new one and this Panasonic ES-ED90- P one had good reviews. Within two minutes of using it dry it started making a strange sound. It sounded like something was caught and hitting the bar as it spun. I found nothing in the tweezer but as I spun it myself by hand I noticed that one line of tweezers caught on the center metal bar each go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not sure how much this compromises the machine, it just makes you wonder what will go wrong the next time I use it and wonder how long until it stops working altogether. I&#x27;m not looking forward to having to go through the whole return process and pay to return on top of it. I wanted to give this brand a chance but I probably should have stuck with Braun.</li>
    <li> Initially this removed the long dark hairs on my arms fairly well although it was quite painful.  As I have attempted to keep the hairs removed...in only two treatments I have ingrown hairs.  This product has a tendency to pull the hairs up, then they snap back and curl in on themselves.  I had a lot of this occurring on my arm.  I had to take hand tweezers and pull those hairs up and then out  (as many as I could find) so that they wouldn&#x27;t become ingrown.  I hate this product and the only redeeming quality is that I can still use it as a shaver and on my feet.</li>
    <li> Only hurt the first time. After that, I think it just breaks off the hairs instead of pulling them out. Overall, I liked the product though. :)</li>
    <li> It works great under arms.  It is just OK on my legs.  I seem to miss some hair every time.  I am not sure my under arm hair is going to grow back which would be wonderful!  I love the foot file.  All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.  I did not find the process painful.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The best I ever used.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I had purchased a much cheaper version before and it did the job but hurt like a SOB.  After soaking in the tub (and I had some wine) for about 20 mins I used this on my lower leg where all my dense hair grows.  It worked great, it still hurt but NO where as it did with the other one. If you are wanting to epilate long term (keeping up with it) I would highly recommend this.  I still had some red bumps but using Tend Skin, those bumps are gone.  The shaver was amazing. I will never use a regular razor again in &amp;#34;that area&amp;#34;. I did try the foot attachment, worked ok. I will probably use that more in the summer as now I have &#x27;winter feet&#x27; so who cares. I also did not try the smaller underarm/bikini attachment.  But I think I would use the normal epilator attachment for my underarms.  if you are new to epilating or are wanting to get hair free for a bikini vacation I would recommend getting lidocaine in the form of recticare. Cheaper on Amazon than I can find in a drug store. Slather it on, some people say a thin layer works but I used a thick (mind you this was with the cheap epilator, before I found this one), let it sit for 20-30 mins then go to work.  All in all, get a good epilator and to me, hair freeness for weeks is worth the short term discomfort.</li>
    <li> Very useful and convenient to an alternative method to hair removal. Since it is my first epilator, it is getting used to it and a whole lot better than shaving. Being Wet/Dry makes it worth the price and versatility of attachments.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay epilator, however, wet or dry you will have to go over the same area several times. For the big epilator head, with all those tweezers, you would have thought it would get everything in one or two pass! Also, the smaller epilator head when used on facial areas caused severe irritation (which of course led to acne/ingrown hair that took a while to go away).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But got it at a reasonable price so it is better than &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; while I go on the lookout for something more effective.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have purchased the numbing hell. Ouch!</li>
    <li> This is the second epilator I&#x27;ve purchased (there was nothing wrong with my first one, but I DID accidentally drop in in toilet while using it and it had to be replaced). I decided to make the switch from Phillips to Panasonic since this one had more head options and the foot file was a big plus. I thought I loved my other epilator, but I didn&#x27;t even know what I could accomplish until I got this bad boy. It pulls the hair out with the greatest of ease and the minimal of pain (it still hurts, I&#x27;m not a robot). I have not yet tried it in the shower for fear of getting electrocuted, but maybe one day. If you&#x27;re lucky enough to have dark and thick body hair like I do, this is definitely something you need.</li>
    <li> Love it, but sure wish something could be done about getting skin caught.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but hurts while using it</li>
    <li> i like the product. IT works well however it s painful for bikini area  and underarm.</li>
    <li> Bought as a xmas gift for my daughter, she still thinks it is too painful.  It causes too much irritation.  She uses the &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; attachments but can&#x27;t use the hair removal attachment.  Perhaps if she was patient sh could work in small patches and get used to it, but she wants the hair gone, and this isn&#x27;t working for her.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this epilator!&lt;br /&gt;1- I can use it in the shower/bath. The warm water opens pores which reduces discomfort.  But, because I&#x27;ve used epilators for years, I feel like this is exfoliating my skin.  I feel no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;2- It comes with changeable heads, not covers. This allows you to use with stuble which reduces discomfort because you don&#x27;t have to wait for hair to grow out. The longer the hair, the greater the pain.  The smaller head is perfect for the upper lip and bikini line. It comes with a &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; cover so new users, or delicate areas like bikini line, don&#x27;t catch skin in the rotating tweezer heads.&lt;br /&gt;3- The head pivots making it easier to move around.  It hugs your curves, no struggling to get to hairs.&lt;br /&gt;4- It&#x27;s rechargeable. You don&#x27;t have a cord getting in the way and it (re)charges in about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;5- Almost forgot the light!  No more struggling with a flashlight to see the back of thighs or going by &amp;#34;feel.&amp;#34;  The light illuminates the skin (&amp; hairs) so you can see the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first (electric-dry) epilator over 10 years ago and remember the pain the first time I used it.  It was painful due to the thick hair from years of shaving and I almost gave up because of it.  But, I pushed through the pain and completed my legs in sections over a few hours.  I&#x27;m glad I did because over time I went from shaving my legs daily to epilating every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get ingrown hairs from shaving, especially the bikini line, I don&#x27;t get them with the epilator.  Also, the hairs that do grow back are fine and sparse.  I&#x27;m glad that now they make rechargeable wet/dry epilators and that I purchased this one.  It&#x27;s a great product at a good price.  It arrived quickly and exactly as described.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. All the heads are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Way better than my old Silkepil.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my old braun epilator, it was about 6 years old and finally kicked the bucket. I thought I&#x27;d try this one because it was wet and dry. I&#x27;ve owned it for a year and am going to be purchasing a new epilator from my old brand. Issues I ran into: it got my knee skin caught in it, the razor cut my skin and this one didn&#x27;t seem to get all the small hairs that my old one did. I did like the mini epilator head for the underarms, it was nice and helped get better results. Overall though, I would skip this one.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve only used it dry a few times but it seems to grab the hair and pull it out by the root. I use it on my face as well.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing.  She says it&#x27;s really painful but that it&#x27;s getting easier and everything we&#x27;ve read online says that the pain will get less and less over time.  She says that she&#x27;s already starting to see that he armpit hair isn&#x27;t growing back in at all in some places (she read that with repeated use eventually you wont need the epilator at all for certain spots).</li>
    <li> Not as sturdy as I expected based on an oldee model, but it is more effective. I love it and use it for almost everything!</li>
    <li> I love this works great. I have only used it 2 times now, however I know its a keeper</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the purple cordless Emjoi Emagine for a year and I thought I liked it pretty well. I bought this Panasonic model because I was interested in the option to epilate in the shower and was also intrigued by the pumice (foot buffing) attachment.  Here are my first impressions (and I&#x27;ll update the review if these impressions change):&lt;br /&gt;-My legs are much smoother with this epilator than the Emjoi Emagine. With the Emjoi, my legs just don&#x27;t feel smooth, ever. But this Panasonic left my legs &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34; smooth (ha!) when I epilated dry (clean skin with no lotion applied).&lt;br /&gt;-The results were not as good when I epilated wet (with shower gel on the head, as instructions indicate). I did one leg dry and one leg wet and the wet-epilated leg is not as smooth as the dry-epilated leg. It is about as smooth as the Emjoi would get it. -Some people seem to think that epilating wet is less painful but I did not find this to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;-The pumice function is awesome! I&#x27;ve never had a rotary-style foot buffer and now I realize what I&#x27;ve been missing. I do a terrible job with a simple &amp;#34;pumice stone on a handle&amp;#34; and usually end up taking off too much skin, and in the wrong places too. With the pumice attachment, it seems to work well to use your ears to listen for when you are going over a rough spot (which helps you take off only the parts that need buffing). I don&#x27;t get the sense that the little pumice wheel lasts very long (will need a replacement pumice soon) but I felt that with about 7 minutes per foot  I removed 2 summers&#x27; worth of callousesr.&lt;br /&gt;-Underarm attachment is great. Did not pinch my skin at all like the Emjoi sometimes does.&lt;br /&gt;-Does not hurt any more or less than the Emjoi. This epilating process involves zappy little tingles which I find to be quite tolerable. The Emjoi sounds louder and more machine-like in my opinion (which might make some women feel self-conscious I suppose, if they are in that phase of a relationship where they feel the need to appear delicate and ladylike all the time). The sound of the Emjoi would definitely invite jokes about weedwhacking and inquiries like, &amp;#34;what the heck are you doing in there?&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;-The skin on my legs is supersensitive and I find both the Emjoi and the Panasonic tolerable dry. My skin did not like the wet epilation with the Panasonic. I got little bumps that feel &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; and I feel like it&#x27;s taking a while (a couple hours) for the skin to get back to normal. This never happens when I epilate dry with very gentle pressure.&lt;br /&gt;-The Panasonic is WAY better on knees and ankles and shins due to the flexible angling of the dual heads (kind of like how those Venus shavers flex to match the shape of your knee). With the Emjoi, you have to get the angle just right or you end up sort of &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34; your skin/hair. I feel like this wastes time.&lt;br /&gt;-The Panasonic&#x27;s light is GREAT. Perhaps that&#x27;s one reason I was able to get my legs smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this will become a top seller soon, due to the versatility, having more/better attachments than either the Emjoi or Phillips comparable models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they both would be better without the bold colors, but that&#x27;s just personal preference. I would prefer silver or plain black myself.they feel the need to appear delicate and ladylike all the time).

    <li> I Love it!  My old one (I forgot the brand)  required many runs over the same area to get all the hair.  This one is QUICK!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female of Asian descent, and am on the hairy side. Over the years, I have tried sugar waxing several times, but always reverted to shaving (time &amp; convenience). I remember trying a friend&#x27;s mom&#x27;s epilator (don&#x27;t remember the brand...) on my underarms in my teens - mostly I remember the excruciating pain and my friend laughing for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 20 years later...a friend recently purchased an epilator for in-between waxing maintenance, and was raving about how different the little machines are now. So I decided to go for it, despite my memories of pain and many cautionary Amazon reviews/YouTube videos of hilarious self-torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...I received the Amazon box, and within 5 minutes I was in the bathroom trying it out, dry. With my husband peering out curiously from the shower, I gritted my teeth and tried a bit of forearm....wha??? A little stinging, but totally underwhelming. Got a little braver, tried a little upper lip...hmm, sharper stinging, but completely doable. Powdered my underarm a bit with talcum powder while reporting excitedly to hubs, closed my eyes, and tried the 2-day post-shave growth...HEY NOT BAD AT ALL!!! A bit TMI, but lastly tried a bit of bikini area with husband observing worriedly (really TMI but my hair is THICK down there)...sharp stinging but NOT BAD!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s that my hair HAS gotten a bit more sparse than my teen years (still robust Asian hair), or that I&#x27;ve given birth twice (but totally had full throttle Epidural), or that the technology has REALLY changed...but this thing is really not that painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes more time than shaving of course, but it is still very convenient compared to waxing. I prefer dry epilation, my hair seems to get elastic when wet, and even with short hair, I had hairs being broken off, rather than pulled out to roots. The gentle cap is nice for delicate areas. The LED light is nice, I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be that useful but it makes a huge difference. I like the narrow opening head, although it takes a little more pressing to the surface for it to work, I can even epilate smaller areas on my face. Have not had a chance to use the foot care head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so afraid, but I wish I&#x27;d tried it years ago. I&#x27;ve always been self conscious of that dark shadow us dark haired people have, in spite of the closest shave. Now my problem areas are no longer problem areas, they look like the smooth skin of a blonde Nordic goddess (almost). If you have similar concerns, I really recommend trying it!&lt;br /&gt;***Update October 2016***&lt;br /&gt;This little workhorse is still going strong - I clean it probably every other week. Probably should order replacement on the shaver, but otherwise no complaints. Easy to clean, no regrets.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and item as listed.</li>
    <li> My last Panasonic epilator lasted several years, so when I died, I searched for something by the same manufacturer. How fortunate that I found this model -- its multiple functions are a godsend. One thing I am particularly jazzed about is the pedicure attachment. Like many wearers of high heels, I develop calluses on my feet that are hard to eliminate using a pumice stone. The pedicure attachment is like a motorized pumice stone, and it is tremendously effective. Here&#x27;s hoping this device last as long as its predecessor.</li>
    <li> Returned this product as it was far too painful</li>
    <li> My wife says it hurts.  I would assume that they all would hurt.  Product seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> This shaver is made for a woman&#x27;s body.  It is effective and very gentle.  It takes under an hour to fully charge and having a cordless electric shaver is very convenient and easy to use.  If comes with several different heads for different areas of the body.  It also has a rough, round head that is fantastic for removing dead skin from the feet.  I shall replace the heads when  necessary and will purchase another when it no longer works.  F. Parker</li>
    <li> Is an excellent product!!</li>
    <li> Much better than expected.  All of the attachments are actually useful!  Most painless epilator I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Will not hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New out of the box, it only holds enough charge to do about one leg.... then takes hours to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;After two months... it now only holds enough charge to do 1/2 a leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power button was also very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than not working, it is perfect... LoL</li>
    <li> I love my Epilator!! But..... OWWWWW!!! the pain on the first use is quite phenominal!! lol. I used to have an epilady but haven&#x27;t used one in a couple of years now and I forgot how painful it was lol, but it does become much less painful the more you use it. I love the flexible head and the look overall look of the epilator..... very girly :) Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was a good product, however it stopped being efficient and has finally given up the ghost within a year of purchase. The extra heads were not worth having in my opinion. I can barely use it still.</li>
    <li> I hate that you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in - and it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long. I also have to go over an area many times to get it fully cleared of hair. I&#x27;ve had this one for a few years and I don&#x27;t use it very often because I don&#x27;t find it really effective. it does get some of the hair off but it does a very poor job. I had an original-old-school type of epilator and that thing ripped the hairs out like nobody&#x27;s business! It hurt more but it really worked.</li>
    <li> First, this does hurt the first time (maybe first couple times) you use it.  A lot.  But it&#x27;s so worth it.  I have a lot of course hair and had to shave daily.  Now I use this once or twice a week.  I use a razor to shave when I need a super close shave.  The epilator gets all the hair you an see but tends to leave the baby fine hairs.</li>
    <li> Item as described A++++</li>
    <li> Great product...removes hair easily without much pain. I experience only a mild sting when using it. I do end up with irritation bumps on my skin but found that using it in the shower or using cool water afterwards helps with that. I love the foot stone attachment and would love to be able to find replacement heads for it. I seldom use a razor anymore...if I do it&#x27;s just for a quick underarm touch up.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor for my wife for Christmas.  She hasn&#x27;t gotten used to it yet.</li>
    <li> Very good in Brazilian hair removal. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great great great! Price and quality very good! This is my first time using an epilator so I am learning as I go but as long as I always make sure to apply a good cream after shaving the skin looks great. The only down side is that you have to wait to shave again... On a positive note hair comes back less and slower!</li>
    <li> great untill i lost the charger....no one has a replaceable charger! So now its useless</li>
    <li> I got this epilator because it has many different functions and heads to exchange into. Well most of the heads did not even come in handy, I only end up using the normal one. The two level speed is kind of pointless. When you push the button once it is set to high, then if you want to turn it off you have to push it twice, it doesn&#x27;t help when you just want it to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting this to be a whole body epilator, but you cannot use this on your face not even with the small bikini head. It doesn&#x27;t really work on your underarm. It end up breaking off the underarm hair instead of pulling it and I have thin underarm hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean maybe I am expecting too much from this, but for $60+ I want it to work. It works great on the legs when the skin and flesh doesn&#x27;t get in the way, you just have to go over the area a million times to get all the hair out. The instructions said not to go over the area more than 3 times well  you have to if you don&#x27;t want to look like a half naked monkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It flakes my skin after I use it on my legs. My skin became really really REALLY ashy afterwards and the instructions said not to put anything on it until after two days later. Well, too bad either deal with the ashy legs for 2 days or put lotion on and deal with the sting, not much of a choice right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really hard to clean the hair off of it, it comes with a tiny bush but it doesn&#x27;t work.Try a tweezers on a tweezer. The battery doesn&#x27;t last too long and it takes 1 hour for a full charge. If it is your first time epilating it will take a long time like I did and trust me it will die before you are finish with one leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is super loud, I mean like blender loud. Close your eyes, turn it on and it will give you the feeling like you are going to put a blender on your skin. I was scared off by the sound since it is my first time trying this hair removal method. My family said they can tell what I am doing in the bathroom when they are down stairs with the TV on; they&#x27;re probably thinking I am trying to get rid of hair with a chain saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave my opinion, your choice if you want to waste money or not. P.s for those who want to try it like me, think twice cause I don&#x27;t think it is moral to return something like this.bably thinking I am trying to get rid of hair with a chain saw.  So I gave my opinion, your choice if you want to waste money or not. P.s for those who want to try it like me, think twice cause I don&#x27;t think it is moral to return something like this.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product it does take time and their is pain involved but after the first few times it does get better.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have to cover the same area a few times to remove all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;maybe that is just the way they all work.</li>
    <li> It works, it hurts, it works. Exfoliate!! to avoid in-grown hairs.</li>
    <li> Besides the pain which is getting better this makes it so much easier to shave</li>
    <li> This is a very good epilator and I like having the dual speeds.  I was hoping for something that worked better for my bikini line and this isn&#x27;t it.  I&#x27;ve tried the head that is specifically for bikini line and it doesn&#x27;t work well.  I&#x27;ve been using the regular head for that and it&#x27;s really hard not to get hurt.  It does work great for legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for years so I don&#x27;t think it hurts or is uncomfortable but for someone who has never used one, it might take a few times to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower so I don&#x27;t know how well it works in water.</li>
    <li> BEST epilator and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> great shaver but i was not too happy with using it/ every time I put to my skin it would pain me. like it was going to cut me. I am not too sure how to use but next time I will try with shaving cream and try using wet instead of dry use on the skin.</li>
    <li> Why I Purchased this Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin and dark hair. I can shave and feel stubble only a few hours later. I wanted to try something that would keep my skin smoother, longer. I have never used an epilator before this. I did a ton of research and found the Panasonic ES-ED90-P Ladies Wet and Dry Epilator/Shaver best suited my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My First Experience with this Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I am a big wuss. I was both curious and terrified. I have dark coarse hair and I&#x27;m pretty sure the roots wrap around my spine. I started off with my lower legs. The first stroke of the epilator had me rethinking the whole ordeal. I seriously debated leaving all of my body hair and growing my own granola. As much as I admire the crunchy gals, I wasn&#x27;t quite ready for such a drastic lifestyle change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to suck it up and see this epilating experience through. By suck it up, I mean, I downed a shot of one hundred proof vodka and gave my legs a second go. The pain lessens as you go over the area a few more times. I found that by using the beginners cap first, then following up with the regular cap, I was able to get my legs smooth with a less painful experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this point, I was feeling more than a little giddy. I moved on to my bikini area. My husband saw the drunken crazy gleam in my eye and suggested I only trim around the edges and save the rest for another day. Good call, honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite use for the epilator has to be my underarms. I love the way they look and feel. I could never get my underarms this smooth with a razor. I found that a little body powder applied to my arm pits beforehand, keeps the area dry and hair removal is easier. It is a little awkward trying to hold the skin taut and work the epilator. Lucky for me, my husband is willing to do this area for me. I pretend I don&#x27;t see the flicker of joy in his eyes when the epilator jerks out a particularly stubborn hair causing me to get creative with my vocabulary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aftermath:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice little red dots all over my legs. I applied Aveeno Daily Moisturizing lotion with natural colloidal oatmeal. This soothed my legs and cleared the spots right up. There are lots of more expensive products made just for this purpose. I have not tried them as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few issues with ingrown hairs as the hair grew back.  I use Earth Therapeutics Hydro Exfoliating Gloves and with my regular body wash in between epilating. This seems to solve that problem plus it leaves my whole body feeling smooth. They are also available on Amazon and I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the Panasonic ES-ED90-P Ladies Wet and Dry Epilator/Shaver.  I haven’t completely retired my razor, but that is because I get a little lazy with the upkeep.  I haven’t regretted my purchase for even a minute.with my vocabulary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aftermath:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice little red dots all over my legs.

    <li> Great product and great service as well!</li>
    <li> I like the variety of heads offered in this pack. The motor is powerful. I also like the light attached; I&#x27;m able to see even the faintest hairs. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love. Didn&#x27;t realize how much better a new one would work</li>
    <li> It removes the hair from the root and my legs stay soft for longer with no hair. I definitely prefer it over waxing and is a lot more cost effective! Just exfoliate a lot to avoid ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and none work as well as this one.</li>
    <li> It definitely will get rid of hair on your legs! Mine is fine so it misses some and I think it cuts some while pulling out others because my legs aren&#x27;t as smooth as I would like. I&#x27;m getting use to the pain, it&#x27;s unpleasant but tolerable and I&#x27;m not cutting my self like I use to with a regular razor. But my legs are really dry so that might be part of it. I really like the attachment for feet, works great on dry, cracked or calloused feet so sandals here I come! Haven&#x27;t used the other attachments yet. All in all I like it!</li>
    <li> This worked great for what I needed it for.  It is very time consuming though.  I can see where if you take the time to keep up with the twee-zing of hairs it would eventually need less and less maintenance.  It can be painful though so that combined with the time sacrifice made me swap back and forth between this and shaving.  I am hoping to go over to just an epilator since it is much cheaper than buying razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator worked great on my legs, I would not use it the day of an event since it left red bumps that needed a few hours to clear.  None of them seemed to become infected or ingrown though.  It didn&#x27;t work well at all for my armpits since it was incredibly painful!  Pulling the hairs out there was too difficult for me.  Also, it wouldn&#x27;t work on my bikini line either.  It had trouble picking up the hairs and then when it did get one every once in a while it was much more painful than just waxing it off.  I did really enjoy the head you can use on the calluses on your feet, it made mine softer and helped with any cracks.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice product. Legs are fine. But under the arm hurts like crazy. I am a first timer.</li>
    <li> This product is fast....i love the way u done quicker and i guess because it&#x27;s quick , i don&#x27;t feel much pain while pulling...</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but is super painful and I have a high pain tolerance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really no wuss - been through a lot of health problems.  So I wasn&#x27;t put off by the pain IF it did a good job.  I followed others&#x27; instructions with the booze.  In fact, I just brought the shot glass and bottle of tequila and partook of several shots.  I also used a gel-type large freezer pad for injuries to help numb my skin.  That was good - worked pretty well.  That being said, it was painful.  I bled in a few spots.  But the clincher was that it not only did not get all the hair but the hair that it did remove wasn&#x27;t gone for long enough to justify the pain.  I can grow hair (on my head anyway) like nobody&#x27;s business so maybe it is just me.  But 24 hours later, I felt ever so slight stubble.  For that kind of pain, I will just shave.  I gave it two stars because I think it was well made and it is perhaps my own biological make up that contributed to its poor performance.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and in perfect condition.  Great battery life, all attachments work wonderfully! I previously used the Epil Silk 7 and get the same results with this model but with more functionality because of the interchangeable heads.</li>
    <li> Amazing I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It so stupid to wright more I don&#x27;t like to read long reviews anyway. I recommended for everyone.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before purchasing this epilator. They gave me the impression that this Panasonic ES-ED90 was a reliable quality product. Unfortunately, its performance is not living up to the praising reviews. Now I wonder how soon reviewers post their reviews after using this epilator. (I&#x27;ve been using mine for 7+ months.)  Before this, I owned a Braun epilator. Although it only came with one attachment, it out-performed the Panasonic in successfully gripping the hairs and pulling them out. Now, with this Panasonic, it takes me twice as long to remove the hairs on my legs and even fails to complete the job. In otherwords, some of the hairs that grow back are slightly ingrown and have left red dots on my legs. The attachment designed for underarms also takes a long time to fully remove the hairs. (On this same attachment is a flimsy metal grill guarding the skin against the grippers which bent a bit and popped out easily while I was gently cleaning it with the product brush.) The attachment designed for callus and rough skin removal works well and is comfortable to use. However, the shaving attachment nips at the skin a little and it&#x27;s detachable bikini comb is too thick and coarse for the job.  For anyone who likes to hold the epilator near the top while epilating (for better control), be careful where you put your fingers. There is a button at the top for releasing the attachments. If you accidentally press this button while epilating, the head is likely to pop off.  Two more disappointments regarding this epilator: a) it takes a long while to charge for only an estimated 30 minutes of use, and b) it&#x27;s unable to function when it&#x27;s plugged into the wall (even after fully charging). The instruction booklet states that &amp;#34;the life of the (lithium ion) battery is 3 years if charged approximately once a week.....have the battery replaced by an authorized service center.&amp;#34;  All in all, the Panasonic ES-ED90 is a mid to high maintenance product with only a few redeeming qualities.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.It pulls the skin and she gets hurt using this.not smooth and gentle while using.</li>
    <li> Worked well initially. Now motor stopped working after 3 uses. Bought 6 weeks ago and return window is 30 days.</li>
    <li> I would like to preface this review with the fact that this is my first epilator. From what I&#x27;ve read from other epilators, I appreciate that this epilator successfully rips the hair out on the first try rather than pulling it painfully without fully plucking the hair. If it&#x27;s going to hurt, it better be worth it, and this epilator delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and have epilated my arms, pits, and legs both dry and wet. I&#x27;ve moved to doing arms and legs dry because I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in pain levels either way, but it&#x27;s so much easier to see my blonde hairs dry when they are sticking up rather than in the shower where I can neither see nor feel them. I do my pits in the shower with soap so the epilator can slide over my skin easier and I have more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased that this epilator has a light on it so you can see what hairs you have missed. Even in good lighting, you&#x27;re still going to be casting a shadow with the epilator, so it&#x27;s nice to have the light move with you. Like a lot of other reviewers, I also quite enjoy the foot care head. The trimmer works well. It gets the job done and it comfortable, but nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used the beginner cap for part of the first time doing my legs. I found it frustrating to have to make so many passes and not come out with completely smooth legs. It&#x27;s a shame to have paid for a piece I only used for five minutes and will never use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my only concern has been that it sometimes takes several passes to catch all the hairs. Like I said before, once a hair is caught and pulled, it is successfully plucked, but I usually have a stubborn hair or two that don&#x27;t catch immediately. I can get them all with enough passes, though. I don&#x27;t know how other epilators compare in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who hasn&#x27;t epilated before, I highly suggest finding a friend for the first go on your armpits, or maybe getting it waxed or something to start thinning out the hairs and toughening up your skin. Maybe I&#x27;m a sissy, but I&#x27;ve only ever shaved before and that first time doing my pits was brutal (arms and legs really weren&#x27;t too bad). I did part of my pits myself in the shower and probably didn&#x27;t have good contact because several of the pores started to bleed. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to continue torturing myself, so husband was hired to finish the job, poor guy. He was much gentler since he could actually get a good angle and see what he was doing. I made him do it the second time and probably could have done it myself since it was a breeze. I&#x27;ve been doing it myself ever since and it doesn&#x27;t take but a few minutes for both.d or something to start thinning out the hairs and toughening up your skin.

    <li> This seems quite painless, but I have a high pain tolerance. Only problem was my sensitive skin didn&#x27;t agree with it. Left it bumpy and inflamed, even with exfoliation. The pedicure attachment was great also, but my grandma has a love for QVC and bought a similar attachment.  The machine was also quiet with a small buzzing noise.</li>
    <li> I got mine today and tried it and all the good thing I&#x27;ve heard on youtube were true. I love it...get it!!!</li>
    <li> It hurts but after you keep using it, the pain lessens.  But definitely worth it because it is a lot easier than heating the wax, applying the wax, ripping off the wax.  Just push the button and get it over with so I would recommend but know that it will not be the perfect answer to that pesky problem.</li>
    <li> My wife got a really good deal for $54.99 when it was on sale. She has used Silk Epil when in school three decades ago. So she thought of buying this one, and it is similar to the one she had before.&lt;br /&gt;She is really good with pain tolerance, so that is not an issue. Just a few passes and get used to the pulling of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great one. But look out for deals regularly and you&#x27;ll never know what you will find.</li>
    <li> To all of those reviews that say using one of these is painful - you must not know real PAIN!&lt;br /&gt;This is just a minor prickly feeling - but the benefits are SO worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Very little shaving to be done anymore!&lt;br /&gt;EXCEPT - it did hurt some - not a lot - on the underarms...maybe I&#x27;ll get brave &amp; try that again, but for legs - what are you waiting for? I wish I would have bought one of these 30 years ago!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for a few years. I&#x27;ve always went with lower priced options, like the Emjoi. Saw this as a deal and decided to treat myself. Well, the only thing I treated myself to were AWFUL ingrown hairs. Even on a full charge and the highest setting, this thing does not go fast enough to grip hairs and pull them out safely. Hairs get ripped below the surface of your skin and get infected. It&#x27;s also pinched my skin multiple times and leaves the skin under my arms glistening and raw and feeling like I&#x27;ve been burned. It takes off a layer or two of skin and leaves behind hairs. I&#x27;ve continued to give it a shot after months and months but i give up. its now a very expensive trimmer and pedicure tool. Back to my wonderful Emjoi Dolphin.</li>
    <li> Ouch! Love all the attachments tho</li>
    <li> Okay ladies I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I love it. This is my 1st epilator and I did not have high expectations. It took years for me to finally try it, because I was convinced it would be too painful to use. I would spend HOURS plucking my sideburns, chin and upper lip with tweezers. I started having issues with my hand cramping up and knew I had to try something else, so I took the plunge. This thing works wonders. I epilate in less than 10 minutes what used to take me hours to tweeze. I do not experience the pinching pain that others describe unless I use it dry.  Perhaps my face is acclimated from the years of tweezing. Here&#x27;s my recommendations: DO NOT USE IT DRY. I lather up my face with bar soap. I dip the epilator head under warm water and apply a dime size dollop of shower gel on the head. This lubrication makes it very comfortable to use. Epilate in multiple directions, because your hair does not grow in one direction, so you need to try to run a path in as many directions as possible to grab the most hair. I have a few thick hairs that really hang on and are even hard to remove by tweezing, so it does not grab everything, but is the best hair removal option I have ever used. I find using it every other day works best. The bumps I had from the years of tweezing have smoothed out significantly. I could not be happier about this thing. If you suffer from facial hair like I do, please try it.</li>
    <li> Hurts like Hell, but it works!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what other purchasers were complaining about - this is a great appliance.  Since it can be used wet or dry, I have done both; I find it most effective in the shower, however, using a shower gel.  It lasts forever on a charge.  I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long to purchase this product.  Great for all body hair.</li>
    <li> This arrived just two days after ordering. I am very pleased, it is delivering on what was promised. The base unit does seem to hold a charge nicely for as long as I tended to need it, and the callous remover worked well as well. I used the mini and main epilator, with equal ferocity. Everything comes apart nicely to rinse as well. It comes with a small drawstring bag to store it all. Compares equally to the old Epilady I had, for effectiveness of the epilation, and the same noise output. But, the Epilady was not cordless. And, price and accessory-wise it is a much better deal for all the extras this includes, for a much lower price. Have not used the razor attachment yet.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it, gives it high marks and she is pretty picky...</li>
    <li> I JUST received this in the mail about 2 hours ago. And yes. I have already used every single head it comes with. Haha, anyway. This is my first epilator and first time ever epilating. I was pretty nervous about the pain, but decided to jump right into it as I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs in about a week. Which brings me to why I purchased. I absolutely DREAD having to shave. My legs get really dry and itchy. It&#x27;s to the point where I&#x27;ve woken up in the night from scratching and my legs are bloody and all scabbed up. Also, I have pcos which causes male hair growth. And as a 21 year old, it&#x27;s pretty embarrassing to have chest hair and a beard. So i turned it on,  and stuck it to the front of my ankle. BIG MISTAKE. Worst pain I could have imagined. So i decided I&#x27;d try my face, AFTER putting the beginner&#x27;s cap on. The face was fine. Not saying it didn&#x27;t hurt, but definitely tolerable. Then to the tub. Decided to suds up my new epilator and give it a try. It still hurt BAD, but not as bad as dry.&lt;br /&gt;I did one leg and realized it was prickly still. I went over and over it and no luck. Tried it dry again, same thing. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just because its my first time epilating or not, but it feels like about a day after shaving would. I will update if anything changes next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been epilating for about 4 months now, and im still not getting those silky smooth legs you do when you shave. I have a feeling it&#x27;s because my hair is so thick. However!!!! I finally found the solution last time. And it was completely by mistake. I was in the tub and realized I forgot to charge my epilator and it died when I was almost done with one leg. So i decided to shave the and epilate again when the hair started to grow in again. So i shaved, got out, and was amazed. My legs were softer and smoother than they have ever been. So after you epilate, EVEN THOUGH THESE NO HAIR..... shave. I&#x27;ve also noticed my epilation has lasted longer. I&#x27;ve also started epilating other parts of my body. Like my armpits. I thought for sure that would be the most painful place... Not really. Just really awkward to get to.  Also, I&#x27;ve tried multiple different soaps, shaving gels, creams, everything.... And my favorite is...baby wash. Seriously. I don&#x27;t have kids, I bought it for a piercing, and I absolutely love it. I use it for EVERYTHING. my body wash, epilating foam, I even used it to wash my couch. Anyway i have super sensitive skin so it doesn&#x27;t irritate me and it makes epilating SO much less painful.of my body. Like my armpits. I thought for sure that would be the most painful place... Not really. Just really awkward to get to.  Also, I&#x27;ve tried multiple different soaps, shaving gels, creams, everything.... And my favorite is...baby wash. Seriously.

    <li> My wife loves it! But she had to get used to having her hairs plucked by this machine.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think it saves as well as I expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;and can&#x27;t use the epilator if you have a tan ..I would rather use it in the summer</li>
    <li> Love my new silky skin. It hurts in the beginning, but when you get used to it, to discover a beautiful result.</li>
    <li> All my life I was doing waxing but since I move to US I never found the perfect way to take my hair out until I try this!&lt;br /&gt;Is very fast, the hair does now grow thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Love it for the emergency situations!</li>
    <li> This exceeded my expectations. Not only a great epilator but a razor and buffer for the feet. And it has a light so you can see what you are doing.</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic epilator. I had an older model for a long time but wore it out so I was going to get another one just like it but I noticed this one with the swiveling head. I&#x27;m glad that I got this model because it is easier to use especially in the shower. I prefer to use this one in the shower and it does a wonderful job. It was worth the extra money for this one because it moves easier with the contour of body.</li>
    <li> I have owned other epilators, and this one works the best -- takes less time, better and more hair removal.  A different brand epilator sometimes even pinched my skin; very painful. I don&#x27;t have to worry about that with this one.</li>
    <li> love it :D nice clean and easy :D</li>
    <li> Package didn&#x27;t have much in the way of protection (a box within a box..inside the larger box there was one sheet of that plastic air pillow stuff on one side only) but luckily there&#x27;s no damage as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used this with the legs &amp; arms epilator attachment for the first time since purchasing and am thrilled. I cannot believe how much hair it removed considering that I had barely a day&#x27;s worth of pretty much invisible stubble. My skin feels so smooth...hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth since I started shaving 20 years ago. So nice to be stubble-free WITHOUT having to go to a salon for a wax or laser treatment. I&#x27;m going to try the other attachments soon and am interested to see how well this machine holds up over time. Will post again if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the purchase price, when I think of how expensive it is to go to the salon regularly. (Since I couldn&#x27;t afford that, I was spending a lot on good razors and shaving cream...am glad not to have to buy these items anymore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the pain...I&#x27;ve tried laser and waxing so this is nothing to me. It does hurt a bit but after a few seconds I was used to it and well able to carry on.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd epilator (also 3x more expensive than my previous ones). It gets more hairs than the others I&#x27;ve had but still can&#x27;t get the shorter hairs. There are times where I see the hairs visible and go over it multiple times but it can&#x27;t grab it. I made sure to use the specific attachment for the underarms. I&#x27;ve honestly gone back to plucking my hairs w/ good ole&#x27; tweezers. My hair is very dark black and thick so I thought it would have no problem latching onto my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still on the hunt for a better products. Just wish i didn&#x27;t spend so much darn money on this one.</li>
    <li> Amazing. My legs stay smooth for over a week. This thing is great if you hate shaving! It can be painful in spots, but not worse than waxing.</li>
    <li> Lots of un-nessisary attachments. Did not hold a charge very long.  Pinched skin when using.</li>
    <li> Love the epilator - almost painless and more effective than anything I had before. All the attachments are great as well. Love the fact that is rechargable and when in use cordless, so I can move around the bathroom with it instead of balance on one foot next to the electric outlet like I had to with my old one.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair on my legs and used to shave every day to avoid stubbles. Years ago I tried using my sister&#x27;s epilator (a different brand) and found it too painful. Because of a recent disability I can no longer shave in the shower so I did my research and chose the Panasonic. I have to epilate using the dry method so I was prepared to experience a lot of pain. The first time I used it I was amazed there was so little pain!!! I use it once a week because my hair grows so fast. After using it a few times I find it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. What a relief. Also, there&#x27;s a file attachment for smoothing the feet that works so well. No more dry cracked feet! Anyway, I am so glad I purchased this epilator, I just love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone out there knows how to order replacement parts I&#x27;d appreciate your feedback. I&#x27;d like to purchase another file attachment. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Been using Emjoi Emagine for a few years and liked it, but the tweezer head wears out in a year and it is SOOOOOO hard to get a replacement - they are always out/on backorder and that takes weeks/months. Decided to try something else…was skeptical if anything else would work better as the Emagine had 72 tweezer disc.  WOW for this Panasonic epilator!  Works even better than Emagine and this one has I think only 48 in the tweezer head.  Legs are so much smoother than Emjoi!  And re-growth seems to be slower. Tweezing time was the same.  Wet works ok too.  Very happy camper here.  :)</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my wife who is very happy with it. She says it is more comfortable than the previous one she had and she likes all the attachment options.</li>
    <li> After spending an hour or so last night reading through the reviews after I had already ordered it, I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive today.  My roommate told me I was crazy and I should just go get waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I locked myself in my room, expected to scream bloody murder but I wasn&#x27;t going to stop for nothing.  First pass on my leg, hey this isn&#x27;t too bad.  No scream no tears. Did a pretty darn good job with minimal pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought ok armpits now... Ouch but no tears or screams.  Pleased with my progress I moved on to my nether regions... Woo hoo smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and didn&#x27;t hurt near as much as the armpits.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never shaving again! Total time Lee&#x27;s than 45 min.  Then I treated myself to the foot stone, that alone is worth the price!!</li>
    <li> First time ever using an epilator! I actually hadn&#x27;t even heard of an epilator until I was browsing electric shavers and happened across this one and decided to try it since it sounded like a promising alternative to waxing or using the smelly and stinging depilatories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived yesterday so today was the first time I&#x27;ve used it; I went with using it dry on my legs and underarms. I read a couple reviews about about shaving before using it, so I shaved two days ago so that there would be some regrowth. After doing this, I think the shorter the hair is, the less the pain will be. The pain was not nearly as bad as expected- yes there is some, but it&#x27;s not any worse than tweezing. It&#x27;s not too noisy either, I would say quieter than my electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am loving that the results will last much longer than shaving and will save money in the long run due to not having to buy razor replacements all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I chose to purchase this one:&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with all the attachments you would need, including a shaver since I will still need that for some areas&lt;br /&gt;-Diggin the foot care attachment!&lt;br /&gt;-Mostly positive reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased. I think it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and found it cheaper outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product:&lt;br /&gt;Epilation is a bit slow but it is definitely one of the most painless for those with thick strands. I bought a [Philips Norelco HP6401/50 Satinelle Epilator] as my first epilator and it hurt too much for my first time but as time continued it slowly got better. After I lost the wire, I thought I would try a new brand. Panasonic is expensive but if you have a coupon it&#x27;s worth the deal. I use the trimmer and the exfoliating head often. My husband doesnt have much hair on his legs so he will epilate from time to time to amuse himself.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely painless although I do have to run through it a few times to get everything. I love the carry-on bag and all the attachables.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It takes a little longer than regular shaving, but it is definitely worth it.  It only hits a little bit in sensitive areas (as expected) but once you get used to it, it is amazing.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES this product. I bought it for her birthday.  She said the epilator does a great job and it is painless.  The foot care attachment is awesome!</li>
    <li> Excelente.  I am very happy with my new Psnasonic</li>
    <li> I bought it 8 months ago. it didn&#x27;t work after 4 month use. and i can not return the item back , i lost my money and desire  to do online shopping.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of my time. I went back to shaving...too painful!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time for me to use a epilator, read the instructions very carefully, and tried one time, so far everything is perfect, very functionally, pain is bearable, just still don&#x27;t know how to clean the head very well. Anyway, I like it~</li>
    <li> I had the older version for about 6-8 years.  I liked it a lot, only the battery gave up on it.  Also, the shaver part stopped working about 2 years ago, but I hardly ever used it anyway.  The newer version has a wider tilted double top that I like.  It is much faster to finish the job this way.  I did notice some ingrown hair a week after the first use, but it is normal.  I use an exfoliating pad, that helps to get rid of them. I really like the foot care head.  I never used it in the shower, but I think the epilator would not work well wet.  The shaver works pretty good also.  It charges fast, and one charge lasts for about an hour or so.  Nice solid product...I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my epilator a few times now both wet and dry. It hurt like hell the first time I used it on my legs but all times after it was smooth sailing. I fear using it anywhere else except my legs but I love it! I&#x27;d love it more if I could use it dry while plugged in but I understand if we had the ability to use it plugged in some idiot might try to use it plugged in while in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a product that REALLY does work!!!</li>
    <li> Love it..... but it hurts really bad :-/&lt;br /&gt;After the second time it wasn&#x27;t so bad. Glad I bought it and would buy again!!</li>
    <li> although it comes with accessories. it doesn&#x27;t work well as compared to the cheaper epilator i once had. i will go back to the cheaper one.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times with the large attachment, so I can&#x27;t speak for any of the other attachments.  It hurts too much so far for me to use it anywhere aside from my arms, but hopefully with more attempts, I will eventually be able to use it for at least my legs, which is really what I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> I have grown to love this product. You do have to follow the instructions. It suggests using it when you get out of the shower. Trust me. USE ASAP AFTER A HOT SHOWER. I tried it as soon as I got it. No pre shower. To quote a recent song, &amp;#34;It hurt like a mother......&amp;#34; After a hot shower there was very little sensation.  EXCEPT, you have to watch for wrinkles. This product had so many warning you have to blow part of them off or there would be nothing left to shave. Heads up with the warning for wrinkles. It took a bite of a wrinkle behind my leg. I was able to turn of the machine and extract my wrinkle. It never happened again when I started pulling my skin tight in the area I was  using this on. After I applied bath oil. I am thrilled how long it takes the hair to grow back. *****update after a couple time using. Not as pleased as before. It does not remove as much hair as thought. In the indoor light it seems to do a good job. Out in the sun you can see how much it has missed. It will still take a bite of any wrinkled areas.  Will try a different brand next time, even though I do love all the attachments.</li>
    <li> OMG does it hurt. LOL. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now. Not sure if I will ever get used to the pain. Works perfectly on my lower legs. But that&#x27;s about it. I got a bad rash many times after i used it on other body parts. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin. But the product is great. Comes with everything in the picture and also comes with protective caps for all additional heads.</li>
    <li> It is super easy, simple and works really good.  A great buy at a great price, should have get it before.  I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Awful! Returned it...</li>
    <li> I love this thing, I have only used it twice, but it was awesome being able to use it in the shower!  It&#x27;s a little painful when you first start but after a few seconds it&#x27;s really not bad at all!!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Braun -- sent it back. Lots of extra gadgets that were not worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  I don&#x27;t find that the sensitive head works well- maybe my hair doesn&#x27;t stand up enough.  The others are stellar.  I do use the gentle attachment for the standard sized epilator head.  The shaver/bikini trimmer is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t expect it to feel good.  It is ripping hair out by the roots.  It stings.  Witch hazel applied afterwards seems to help the red spots on my skin afterward.</li>
    <li> I love my Panasonic Ladies Wet and Dry set! I&#x27;ve used it for almost four months now, and I like it better every time I use it! I use all of the attachments, with the exception of the pink attachment that&#x27;s meant to ease the discomfort of epilating. I have been able to use the shaver attachment for any areas that are just too sensitive to epilate. I also love the pumice tool for keeping my feet smooth. I got one for my daughter at the same time as I got mine. She is not able to tolerate the epilating features, but loves the shaver and the pumice attachment as well. We have been using the pumice attachment every 1-2 weeks for four months and it does not yet seem to be losing it&#x27;s ability to do the job. It is helpful to use an exfoliator or a sugar or salt scrub to help prepare your skin for epilating as well as to help prevent in grown hairs afterwards/between sessions. I find that once a week is adequate for myself for maintenance, but it only takes a few minutes to run the epilator over my legs if I want to be double-extra-sure! I have even considered buying an extra one for if/when this one gives up the ghost (just in case they&#x27;re crazy enough to stop making it)!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this one as a replacement. I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;  The battery of my old one lasted less than 2 years, and we couldn&#x27;t find a replacement. My only worry is, how long will this one last?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited several months before writing a review because I wanted to get a few good uses out of it.  I love this item.  I had one before (Braun) and it died after 5 years.  I like the versatility of this item.  I love that it works on battery and works for a good 45 minutes.  That&#x27;s enough time for me.  I&#x27;ve used several of the attachments but mainly stick to just a couple of them.  I like having the availability of the others though in case I should ever need them.</li>
    <li> Great shipping, great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! Epitaxy products have sure come a long way. I owned the first one of torture and you had to let your hair grow out in irder to catch it in the coils. This new Panasonic version is great. Close shaves that really last and even short hair is removed. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, product as described, works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews and because with the different attachments, it seemed like it provided the best bang for my buck.  Unfortunately, I am unhappy with it. It seems to leave a lot of hair, and I&#x27;m not so sure most of the hair it gets is actually pulled out by the roots.  I have never used an epilator before so I suppose part of the problem could be pilot error, but I have read the instructions as wells various epilation tips online.  In addition to the hair I can see it leaving, my legs always feel like they have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, sort of like legs feel at night after having been shaved in the morning.  So either my idea of smooth and the manufacturer&#x27;s and positive reviewers idea of smooth are two different things or this epilator isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  And yes, I&#x27;m aware of the different rates of hair growth, blah, blah, blah, and feel I have made allowances for this.  I have tried it wet.  I have tried it dry.  I have tried it fast.  I have tried it slow.  I have tried exfoliation.  I have tried baby powder.  I have tried straight lines.  I have tried circular patterns.  I have tried everything I can come up with and yet, there is always a lot of hair left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are a joke.  The bikini comb is useless unless you&#x27;re going for the Sasquatch look.  The small head is equally useless.&lt;br /&gt;The foot care head actually isn&#x27;t too bad and may just be the highlight of the entire product.  The light is handy, too, so you can see all the hair that is being left behind.  I discovered by accident, when I forgot to put the guard back on after cleaning it, that the best way to use this thing is with no guard at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the pain goes, it hurt the first time.  Really hurt.  I consider myself to have a fairly high tolerance for self-inflicted pain, and it was about all I could stand. Ironically, doing my armpits hurt less than my legs, and my armpits were left in a bloody mess so go figure.  I have very pale skin, and the first time, my legs turned a livid shade of purple with red dots all over them.  The purple faded after a few hours, but it took a couple of days for the red dots to go away completely.  This isn&#x27;t something I would recommend trying for the first time on the day of the wedding or on that big day at the beach.  It still causes the red dots, but I&#x27;m finding that the more I do it, the less redness there is.  People who do not glow in the dark as I do may not have a problem with redness at all after the first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not satisfied with this, but I&#x27;m not prepared to shell out another 100 bucks yet, either.  After I&#x27;ve used it a few more months and can justify buying another, I&#x27;ll definitely be trying another brand.</li>
    <li> It works ok. The epilator takes some getting use to. It left bruises under my armpits. I&#x27;m glad you can shave with it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really feeling I wasted my money on this - people say this hurts, I have had 2 kids with no pain medication and let me tell you --- THIS FREAKING HURTS!!! Maybe I&#x27;m doing this wrong? I&#x27;m not sure but if so, someone help me out here! I will say the only feature I have found useful on this device is the foot buffer...</li>
    <li> Love it!  I use the shaver, epilator, and pumice.  Haven&#x27;t used the bikini one,  don&#x27;t plan on it either.  But it works very good.  I like the light option.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Less painful than waxing especially when used in the bathtub.  I used both the bikini, foot pumice and leg  attachments.  Another added bonus is that when I use in the shower I haven&#x27;t yet gotten the bumpy rashes you can get when you wax.</li>
    <li> I own a cheaper Panasonic epilator model, and because I loved that one, I gave in to the temptation of trying out a model with more bells and whistles. And I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like shaving and shelling out so much money for Venus shaver and refills (yes they are overpriced).  So I pluck where I can and it was a tedious chore.  When I tried out the Panasonic epilator, I was so happy because this made the job so much faster.  I use Kiss My Face Moisture Shave in the shower and it&#x27;s fantastic, it epilates smoothly and quickly. The underarms and legs are a breeze.  I do them weekly, and I can honestly say that the results are even better than plucking (which can take me such a long time) and shaving.  The hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast as with shaving.  After epilating in the shower, I use a mixture of aloe vera and witch hazel to soothe my skin and in a couple of hours the sensitivity and redness goes down for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does hurt for those who aren&#x27;t used to plucking, but honestly, you get used to the pain. Well, except for the bikini area.  Well, this new Panasonic model has an attachment that has a narrower epilating area for the bikini area, and while it does hurt, it does become bearable after a while.  I think the results are so worth the money I paid for this.  In the long run, I&#x27;ll save from not having to buy those costly Venus refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, another bonus is the shaving head.  If epilating is too painful for you, this head does a great job, especially when you&#x27;re in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to bother with gels and doing it in the shower.  It&#x27;s not the same as a regular shaving blade like Venus, the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast or as thick with this attachment.  My daughter actually likes to use the shaving head on the upper lip, takes just a minute, and she doesn&#x27;t have to do it again for at least a week or so, and sometimes, I do too when I don&#x27;t want to bother plucking.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy.  Since I don&#x27;t use showergel, as is recommended, I soak the heads in a mixture of water and hydrogen peroxide for a minute, rinse them off and lay them to dry on a towel. Then they&#x27;re good for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the LED light on this one, which is necessary in the shower.  And also, the two speeds are helpful.  The slower speed is perfect for beginners, but I tend to use the higher setting because I&#x27;m so used to epilating now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the foot exfoliating head yet, so I can&#x27;t say how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this gadget is worth every dollar I spent on it.</li>
    <li> Ok So I have been epilating for 6-7 years now. I have had two of the Braun Xelles and after 3 years decided to get a new one. Before I was only epilating my arms, then I grew sick of shaving my legs every other day and decided to also start epilating my legs. So I got the Braun Silk Epil 7 wet and dry. I used it twice and realized that it does not even measure up to Braun Xelle. The silk Epil 7 was just not pulling my hair and I had to go over the same area 3-4 times. Also it was slower than anticipated so I returned it and bought this Panasonic one. And as someone who has been epilating for years here are my pros and cons for this epilator from a non biased point of view&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Beautiful design&lt;br /&gt;- Fits great in hands&lt;br /&gt;- Pivoting head which is AMAZING to reach non flat areas&lt;br /&gt;- VERY fast (at least compared to my Braun Silk Epil 7 Wet and Dry)&lt;br /&gt;- You can use this wet and dry (Although using wet irritates my skin more so I prefer to use it dry)&lt;br /&gt;- Cordless&lt;br /&gt;- Fully charged in 1 hour&lt;br /&gt;- No need to go over an area multiple times&lt;br /&gt;- Small area attachment&lt;br /&gt;- Smart Light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Charge lasts only 30 minutes or so (usually enough to do a leg and a half for me)&lt;br /&gt;- Does NOT come with an ice glove like Braun epilators do&lt;br /&gt;- Noisy (although does not bother me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So at this point after using it on my legs and arms, I have only 3 cons and more pros. So far I am VERY impressed with the unit. Let&#x27;s see how long it lasts. Also I purchased a two year protection plan for $10 JUST IN CASE. This is the first epilator ever I bought a protection plan for and actually registered the product so that means that I really like it then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything changes, I will update the review</li>
    <li> Probably the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon! It has lots of heads and everything is useful! So glad that I found this. If there were 10 stars I would give them all.</li>
    <li> My Braun Silk Epil broke and I was looking for an affordable new epilator.  I decided to try this one, though it has more functions than I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side: It does have many features I was looking forward to exparimenting with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the negitives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panisonic only epilates half of the hair, missing long ones,&lt;br /&gt;Using it backwards has a slightly better effect,&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s excellent at grabbing skin (even when the skin is taut) and has left cuts,&lt;br /&gt;The light quit working consistantly after about 3 weeks,&lt;br /&gt;The battery some times runs out before I&#x27;m done (it was freshly charged).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence, this is definately NOT holding up to the reliability of my old one.  I seldom use it, relying more on a plain tweezers.  I would have sent it back but I let the 30 days expire.  When I can afford to I&#x27;m going back to Braun.</li>
    <li> Ouch! But wow! I&#x27;m crazy busy, so by the time I shave, I&#x27;m hairy again. This gives me a greater window of smooth and is way cheaper than waxing. I was nervous about taking the plunge but am so glad I did. Using shower gel as directed makes it easier. I would assimilate the pain to getting a tattoo, hurts at first but then goes numb. Armpits are the worst but I sure love knowing they are smooth after a week!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this.......I used it and it was painful......... but getting waxed hurts more. I&#x27;m so glad that I got this on a lightening deal!!        *****one month later &amp; I still LOVE this product!!!!!! I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!!*****</li>
    <li> Wow! I had a cheap store bought epilator and it hurt like hell, was looking at reviews and seeing it was meant to get easier with time.. it didnt! I seen this one on sale and with the attachments and thought it was worth a try. Wow it is seriously night and day, can run this up my leg without my eyes watering.  The light is amazing to make sure all those little hairs are gone. It has a fast setting and a slow which is more gentle for delicate areas. Charges really quick and lasts 30 min per charge. The smaller face attachment I&#x27;m still working on that and what angle gets the hairs, the foot attachment is as good if not better than the new foot file we have all seen in the stores for 40$! I love that the main big head on this swivels and moves with a woman&#x27;s body and isn&#x27;t just a big clumpy piece of plastic like others. I believe this brings down the pain level too. Finally sold on an epliator. This one is amazing on bringing down the ouch level and getting the job done quickly.</li>
    <li> Panasonic definitely hit the mark with this one! Excellent quality and functionality at what i feel to be an appropriate price. I would have liked to seen a better battery life however.</li>
    <li> My wife said &amp;#34;This is a excellent product&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Ordered it for my friend, she is totally satisfied, recommended:)</li>
    <li> Got everything in the picture and even a little cleaning brush. Works perfectly. The sound isn&#x27;t too loud.</li>
    <li> I am used to the old Braun products, saying that, I really loved the fact that it had two spinning heads that worked together, the fact that I had couple of heads I could use and replace, the fact that I didn&#x27;t have to have a cord connected while working and the light on the skin. The only problems I had with the products were that I couldn&#x27;t turn off the light, it is a default when it works and that it isn&#x27;t ideal to use on the armpits because the head is too big (at least for my armpits). Totally worth it !</li>
    <li> It does the job but it is super painful and time consuming. To be honest i used it once as i could not cope with the thought of going through so much pain again.</li>
    <li> This is great. My old one needed to be replaced badly. I am very pleased with this model. I wish it wasn&#x27;t cordless but so far it&#x27;s been holding out ok.</li>
    <li> I bought and ultimately returned this epilator; it just didn&#x27;t work well for me.  I gave it three stars because it&#x27;s very likely that it just doesn&#x27;t work well with fine hair.  Yes, it hurts a bit to use, but you expect that with an epilator (I even found it kinda satisfying as it ripped out my unwanted hair!).  However, though it did fairly well on my legs, I had to repeatedly go over the same areas to get most of the hair.  For my underarms and bikini line, it just didn&#x27;t even begin to get half the hair and repeatedly nicked my skin.  I tried pulling the skin taut as the manual suggests, I tried using it on stubble, on longer hair, wet and dry, etc., but it just wasn&#x27;t working on those areas.  The foot callus buffer was really nice, but you can get those by themselves for a fraction of the price.  Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth giving it a try if you have somewhat thicker hair that it can really grab onto but should probably pass on it if you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> i love the epilator!!  no more shaving, no more tweezing!  it removes hair super fast without pinching the skin.. a little painful at first, but u get used to it... love it!!</li>
    <li> Love it! very easy to use, the pain is not as painful as it sounds. Maybe because I am use to getting waxes. But using this on my armpit and bikini took only 10 minutes tops. Quicker than waxing. I LOOVEEE It!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, My wife just love it. I have a wrong shipment, but called Amazon and they fix the issue in the same day, thanks AMAZON for the great Customer Service Support. My wife recommends this product, she said it works as described, she said it was painful the first time she use it, but she hasn´t realized that she has to start with the beginners blade, so please read the instructions first.. hehehehehe When she used the right one, she said that it works perfect.</li>
    <li> I just finished using my new Panasonic emulator and I&#x27;m actually blown away. I&#x27;ve been replicating for 6 years now and I&#x27;ve owned 3 Braun epilators. Those ones don&#x27;t hold a candle to this one. I was able to do both arms and legs in one sitting with charge left over whereas I could maybe get half of that done with the Braun. Then Panasonic covers more area and is amazingly efficient. You don&#x27;t have to go over and area repeatedly to remove the hair. It glides over your skin and doesn&#x27;t tug on the hair like the Braun. The double epilating barrels are easy to clean. I love the bright light too. If you&#x27;re new to eplating, try this one first. Is it gonna hurt? Yeah it&#x27;s gonna hurt cuz you&#x27;re ripping out hair but your endorphins kick in in about 5 minutes, lol. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it in the shower but it&#x27;s nice to have that option. I love all the attachments. Again, I highly recommend this epilator to new and veterans users.</li>
    <li> I made this purchase a couple of weeks ago and it is just amazing! I epilate all the areas and it works great! I used it both ways: in shower and dry. Works good both ways, but in shower it is really less pain. This epilator also has head for feet, which really surprised me: using it I can make my feet pretty in 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> First I would like to say that I am giving this 5 stars, but I need to make this very clear. It does hurt! So make sure you before you buy this that you are very certain, without a doubt, a person who can handle pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband purchased this for me for Christmas, so I have been using this product for about 2 and a half months. The first time I used it, I had read previous reviews about the pain, so I knew what I was getting myself in to. Another reviewer said that she had a few shots to help her through, so I poured myself some wine, definitely helped! I also have read that if you soak your legs in a bath beforehand this would also help. With my glass of wine and a nice hot soak in the tub it was time to begin. Oh I also exfoliated before starting as well. I turned on said device, placed a tiny drop of body wash on it and began. &amp;#34;Holy Hell&amp;#34; was the first thing I thought! Half way through (glass of wine gone)(husband brought me more), I was starting to question if this was really worth it. Then I started to positive self talk myself, &amp;#34;you can do this, just think about never having to shave your legs again&amp;#34;, so I continued on. Never at any point does the pain get easier, wine helped, but it was still painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that first time of horrible pain and wonderful wine, every time I have done it since, it is not at all painful, but that is because you hair grows back thinner than it was before. I also ignored the warning about not doing your knees, pfft, who wants hairy knees? I did not use the guard either and I started with the biggest blades, not the smaller ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used the foot scrubbing tool thing and I love that just as much! I have not gotten the courage up yet to do my under-arms, but once I do I will update this. I also have not tried it on my bikini area because I have always waxed that area and I am fine with continuing to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed in the instructions it never said length or growth time of hair. Mine was two days hair growth. I have also heard that your hair growth, on your legs at least, goes through three cycles. I use this product about once a week and it has cut my showing time each day in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I have now convinced two of my other friends to get one!</li>
    <li> in the shower feels like you did a good job but as soon as I dried out I see half of my hair still there</li>
    <li> I replaced my older Panasonic, well at least it has taken second place. My older one still works fine, but right after I got it the attachments disappeared during a move along with my drill bit package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachment I have used, the bikini head, I use on my whiskers.  It does a good job at separating the whiskers from my face and not my skin from my face.  It is also good under arm.  Sorry I don&#x27;t wear bikinis anymore. :)  The little light is a nice addition that I originally wasn&#x27;t interested in. I would miss it if it were gone now.  I have used the main head on my legs, and it works as expected.  My experience with Panasonic epilators is that they are excellent products, and if you can stand using a good epilator under your arms you will be able to use one on your whiskers, ladies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for many years, so I can&#x27;t comment on pain. My previous epilator, which I reviewed on 4/1/2012, stopped working efficiently, and rather than buy a replacement head, I decided to buy a new system. I was drawn to this one because of the shaving attachment; I don&#x27;t epilate my thighs and got tired of dragging out my old Braun shaver and plugging it in to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My prime worries:&lt;br /&gt;-- Pinched skin. My beloved Phillips never pinched my skin, not once, but my old Braun pinched me bloody all the time around my knees and underarms. I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic twice and NO pinching at all. The instructions say not to use it on knees, but I did anyway. No problem!&lt;br /&gt;-- Time. I used to have to set aside an hour with my original Braun; the Phillips worked in half that time or even less. The Panasonic takes me around 20 minutes for legs and underarms; I go about 2 inches above my knee. I&#x27;m glad the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t take longer than the Phillips, and I think it&#x27;s actually a little bit faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unexpected bonuses:&lt;br /&gt;-- Pivoting head. I didn&#x27;t know that I needed it, but I love it!&lt;br /&gt;-- Underarm attachment. The separate, smaller attachment makes epilating my underarms SO MUCH EASIER. My Phillips was problematic in that area after I got in shape a year ago, lost my arm flab, and developed serious arm muscles. I could NOT epilate my armpits properly without contorting like a pretzel to try to make the area flat, and even then I couldn&#x27;t get all the hairs. It doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal, but it was really hard! Who knew that underarms could have such curves?&lt;br /&gt;-- Soap! You can put soap on the wet/dry attachment heads and run it to clean it. Though I was able to rinse the Phillips with water, I couldn&#x27;t use soap on it. I think it just got grungy over time and that&#x27;s why it stopped grabbing hairs that were staring it right in the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some slight cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- You CANNOT use the Panasonic while plugged in since it&#x27;s a wet/dry appliance. The Phillips still worked while plugged in, which was good because the charge always ran out before I was done with both legs and underarms. So far with the Panasonic, a single charge is plenty for me to do underarms and legs. The battery light doesn&#x27;t even turn on, but I&#x27;ve been charging it after using so that it&#x27;s ready for next time.&lt;br /&gt;-- It&#x27;s smaller than my other epilators and has buttons right where my fingers hold it, in front and back. I have to make sure I&#x27;m not pressing too hard, otherwise I might decrease the speed (front button) or pop the attachment off (back button).&lt;br /&gt;-- The shaver attachment hurts a little on my thighs! I didn&#x27;t realize that I&#x27;m supposed to pop something up, so that might be why. I&#x27;ll try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I haven&#x27;t tried:&lt;br /&gt;-- The gentle/novice protector cover thing.&lt;br /&gt;-- Bikini line. I went through that initial blinding pain once for my bikini line years ago, but then a big pregnant belly kept me from keeping up with it. I have not been brave enough to go through it again, so I don&#x27;t know how well the Panasonic does in that area.&lt;br /&gt;-- Foot attachment. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try it once Spring actually shows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes:&lt;br /&gt;The instructions suggest doing underarms once a week and legs once every two weeks. Ha! Can anyone really go that long? I do my underarms twice a week because I&#x27;m scared that if I go longer, it will hurt to do it again. It was utter madness to do it the first time, years ago, but has not hurt at all since then (really, I feel *nothing* doing my underarms). I must reiterate: if you can get through the unbearable torture of epilating your underarms once, it will be worth it! Just give yourself lots of time and a comfy spot nearby for all the near-fainting spells. My legs would benefit from 2x/week but I am lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s funny that I&#x27;ve been anxious about replacing my epilator each time, and each time I wonder why I waited so long!</li>
    <li> Works great, love having epilator and shaver in same unit. Easy to clean, easy to change the different heads. I am very happy with this unit.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Its fast, the head with a lot of hair removers makes it faster and it doesnt irritante the skin</li>
    <li> Wow, two weeks without shaving my legs!  I gave it two stars because upon using it dry, it required a double application to remove the all the hair. After two weeks I notice major ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I have never gotten an epilator before, but I&#x27;m kind of digging this. Yes, it hurts I won&#x27;t lie but not so much I can&#x27;t stand it. I did my legs first so I could gauge the pain level before I did my underarms, and quite frankly it hurt more on my legs than my underarms. I would definitely recommend doing in the evening, best after a bath or in the bath. It has many different heads, and a shaver. I really like that you can use it in water, that really makes the difference because doing it dry hurts A LOT.</li>
    <li> Did not like.  It hurts. I would not recommend this item to anyone. I was really hoping it would work but it was not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> It may say somewhere online but my mom wanted this for her face, it specifically says not to use on your face in the directions, so I&#x27;m returning it for her.</li>
    <li> Attended my expectations, it&#x27;s a really good product</li>
    <li> HATE IT OH MY GOD OOOOOUUUUCHHHH!!! i tried using it, i really did, for a good 2 or 3 hours. i even followed another reviewers guidance &amp; got good an&#x27; knockered after the first hour had my eyes watering &amp; had produced absolute minimal results.  I have a high tolerance for pain. i&#x27;ve had a baby. i&#x27;ve had my nose broken. i&#x27;ve seen some s***! but this mess was REDICULOUS.  long story short 3 hours, a medium-sized glass of straight vodka, and lots of curse words later i&#x27;d done about 1/5 of my size-1 legs &amp; it was a mess. like 2 out of every 10 hairs get grabbed per pass. and then, as a bonus, as the hairs grew back it produced this fantastical rash.  HATE HATE HATE HATEHATEHATEHATE.  save your money, suck up the embarrassment &amp; go visit a laser hair removal place. that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m gonna do after i set this thing on fire and dance around it naked -and furry-</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  She cannot stop talking how nice and smooth it is</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s less painful than other epilators because it removes less hair at a time. That being said I would appreciate it more if it took less to remove it all. It also gave me a few ingrows. But it is better on the skin, makes it less sensitive. Overall, it is a good product!</li>
    <li> Performs well, though the LED light is slightly annoying-too bright and causes glare.</li>
    <li> Love all the extras that came with this.  Works great on the face.  Still getting use to the hair removal on the legs...ouch!</li>
    <li> I just got this last night and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  I did my under arms and bikini area and LOVE it.  Doing the pits was pretty uncomfortable, but it went fast and the results are fabulous!  The bikini area is good, too.  Not as painful because I&#x27;m used to waxing.  I tried to do my legs, dry, and it was pretty bad.  I&#x27;m going to soak in the tub tonight and try again wet.  I really want to do my legs, too, since it&#x27;s so awesome everywhere else, but I may have to work up to it.  I&#x27;ll get there!  I will really enjoy &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; only once every week or so...it will save so much time!</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Better than what I have expected.</li>
    <li> I used emjoi and this is definitely better</li>
    <li> Love it compact n fast</li>
    <li> Bought this and it is the worst epilator I have ever used. I have used several epilators and this was the most painful and it catches skin and pulls it in like crazy. Do not buy. Love Panasonic shavers but this epilator was a huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> This Epilator works better than the first one I bought. I love that it can be use wet or dry and that if you don&#x27;t want to use the epilator you can use the shaver instead. I strongly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure when depilators got so expensive. I lost my old Braun depilator/shaver during a move, so I bought this one as a replacement. It doesn&#x27;t work as well--maybe because it&#x27;s cordless. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find a corded model with the attachments I wanted. My Braun used to get everything in one sweep, whereas this one requires multiple passes, which leads to irritation in places like the armpits. I have very fine hair at this point after years of depilating, though, so it may work better with people with coarser hair.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I used this the lst time. I had let my hair grow out longer in hopes the pain would be minimal. Wrong, I couldn&#x27;t finish one leg completely. It didn&#x27;t pull any hairs out considering it was suppose to be less painful than others. I should have sent it back but I use the foot/heal part for filing down toenails and smoothing chapped areas. If you don&#x27;t like pain, don&#x27;t purchase this. It&#x27;s much less painful using a razor and you get smoother legs rather than with the epilator</li>
    <li> The first time using this epilator is rather painful, but the results are worth it!!! And, after the first use, the pain minimizes, as your hair becomes finer and easier to remove. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Have used an epilator for years and this is the 1st one I can use on my underarms that is not excruciating! Many features, works great, love it!</li>
    <li> this is the best epilator I have used so far, not as painful as some. But keep in mind you are still pulling hairs out of your body so it is not painless. I have found that the easiest way is with the wet skin but instead of using shower gel per the manufactures suggestion, use a cheap Hair Conditioner on the skin. It allows for the epilator to glide more smoothly, rinse off with rather warm water and use some kind of pore restore lotion afterwards.</li>
    <li> amazing product. never used in the water. but its is so smooth and amazing</li>
    <li> I expected the epilation process to be quite painful, since so many people compared it to Brazilian waxing.  When I used to get my legs waxed, it hurt a LOT - it felt like my skin was being ripped off along with the wax and hair!  And afterward, there would be redness and quite a bit of skin irritation (which made it almost not worth the pain, trouble, and mess), and there would always be some stray hairs that were left that I had to shave or pluck.  Even shaving my legs and underarms has always caused a lot of skin irritation.  Unfortunately, this is common with very sensitive skin (which I have).  So, when I decided I would try an epilator again (I tried one many years ago and that experience was AWFUL!), I was prepared to have a very painful experience again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After &amp;#34;bracing myself for the worst&amp;#34;, I set the epilator to the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; setting with the &amp;#34;gentle cap&amp;#34;, gritted my teeth and proceeded to try it on my legs.  I was pleasantly surprised with the Panasonic Epilator!!  It was way less painful than the various shavers I&#x27;ve tried and used (both wet &amp; dry), and not at all like waxing.  In fact, since it really didn&#x27;t hurt at all, I wondered if it was actually working (it was).  So I then tried it on the regular setting - still only negligible pain, and even without the &amp;#34;gentle cap&amp;#34; it was easy.  I used the shaver head on my underarms in the shower, and then the underarm epilator head with the same experience and results.  Now my legs and underarms are nice and smooth, and there has been absolutely NO skin irritation at all.  I am extremely pleased with the Panasonic Epilator!  I am so glad I bought this as a (early) Mother&#x27;s Day present for myself.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy it a lot sooner.</li>
    <li> I had a super old school epilator before this. It didn&#x27;t give me ingrowns. This one does. I dunno what would really make it that different. What I know is before I didn&#x27;t get them. Now I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work just fine in the shower. I haven&#x27;t gotten it to foam up like the videos and ads, but maybe I just don&#x27;t have the right body wash?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking of buying it for the foot thing...just buy a separate pedicure one. I don&#x27;t think you can get replacement heads like you can with the separate pedi ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the narrow gentle head or whatever to be pretty useless. The shaver...same. I don&#x27;t know who uses a shaver like that. If I wanted to electric shave, why would I buy an epilator, right? Maybe if you have a huge hairy area that needs trimmed before you can epilate this would be useful? I do not, so it&#x27;s not. Plus the directions say to shave, wait 2 days, then epilate, then some more instructions. Point is, I don&#x27;t know why you need a trimmer/shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to last a long time. I was worried about that based on reviews, but I get plenty of time out of it to do whatever I need.</li>
    <li> Its wonderful.  I&#x27;ve only used one other brand and both work well.  I like that it has exchangeable heads.  The only negative is that I cannot use it while it is charging.  It is painful, however its less painful if u trim the hair a little bit and tighten ur skin as you go.  Once you start, you should get used to the pain.  Overall, pretty awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it dry and the results were fantastic.  I love having the option of well depilating as well, not to mention the various attachments! 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> So there are two models, this one and one that&#x27;s more pink and less maroon. They are both waterproof and I think the only difference is that the other one comes with less heads. At any rate, this product worked well ONE TIME. It removed a lot of hair rather painfully, but it got most of it off. The subsequent sessions have been pure frustration as pass after pass FEELS like its plucking, but it seems completely incapable of ACTUALLY getting the hair out. Fine hairs? Forget it! I&#x27;m ordering a different brand and hoping for better results, because if this is how all epilators are I might as well just start shaving again. Total disappointment with this one. Yeah, you can epilate in the bathtub, and that&#x27;s great, but seriously if you&#x27;re not getting the hair out and all you&#x27;re getting is a painful tugging sensation even over the most taught of skin, then what&#x27;s the point? Don&#x27;t bother with this one, I&#x27;m sure there are MUCH better products out there. I will say that when it DID pluck out thick hairs, you could actually see that it was getting the full root unlike the Braun I picked up where the hairs were just broken off and there was never any evidence of a root coming out. The other problem I had was that if your skin is moist, but not wet, or if you apply pressure, the motor on this slows down and seems to struggle with the whole process. This makes areas like underarms (which can be clammy) a pain to do unless you&#x27;re in the shower. I&#x27;m going to continue shopping for a better epilator.</li>
    <li> Works well and is nowhere near as painful as I anticipated! Works best with wet lubricated skin.</li>
    <li> I went online (panasonic.com) to buy the replacement buffer and found it was not listed as an option to buy online.  I called the 800 number and was transferred several times.  When I talked to a live rep, she suggested I try buying the part from Amazon or Best Buy (????) and I had difficulty understanding her.  I asked to speak to her supervisor and was told there was no supervisor available.  She did set up a case # for Panasonic to call me back. We&#x27;ll see...  In short, I think Panasonic is counting on the customer to dish out $$ for a new epilator when you need something other than what they provide for parts.  Too bad, I love the pedicure buffer and the epilator, I&#x27;m just very disappointed that I can&#x27;t get the parts I would like and found their customer service less than helpful.  If I could obtain the parts, this would get a 5 star!</li>
    <li> Super painful but worth it</li>
    <li> My prior Epilator lasted about 10 years.  I always thought is was great.  But, when I received this one,  I realized I never knew what I was missing!  Gentle on my skin, comfortable to use, easy in my hand and love the flexible head.  Haven&#x27;t used it on my legs or in thee tub or shower yet.  But, I plan to in the future.</li>
    <li> To preface this review, I have only used the device once and only on my legs. But I have to admit that I love it! It is so freeing not having to shave anymore. I will admit that it was painful at first, but as it plucks more hair out the less it hurts. Plus, the pain is rewarding...if that makes any sense at all. I am excited to try it out on my underarms and bikini area.</li>
    <li> I am sooooo happy I picked this on amazon - amazing price &amp; such a nice handy smart tool for a sweet hairy girl like me .</li>
    <li> Wow!!! I love it. Background: I have been using different brand for the past 5 yrs on my bikini and armpit areas. This is the first time I ve ordered panasonic brand. My previous one keeps turning off on me even though it is fully charged, so I had 2 wks of arm pit growth and about a month of bikini growth. I started with armpits and dry skin, there are two rows of twizzers so it took care of my arm pits pretty quickly but not very smoothly...still better than the stupid epilator that keeps turning itself off. I moved on to bikini area, I usually put baby powder on so it grabs easier, still not impressed, the usual experience. I looked at the box again for some hope of excitement and it said I could use it in the shower, so I decided to try.&lt;br /&gt;This is where this epilator shines, literally 7 minutes later I am done...I could not believe it!!!! The doubt of poor lighting and bunch hair left over crawled into my head. I got out and there is nothing...not a single stray hair. I love it!!!! No bruising, so fast and very little pain compared to my previous one. I am so happy and hairless, I love it. Thank you Panasonic for this product and I am very sorry for not finding you 5 years ago!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this epilator and had great hopes for it.  The pinching as hairs were lifted out wasn&#x27;t all that painful but the problem I had is that my leg started bleeding when hairs were removed.  After about the third bandaid I decided I had better stop and return the item.  I really wanted it to work for me but I&#x27;ll be headed back to my cheap disposable razor that works just fine!</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Folica.com for 78 dollars. I was extremely excited to get this product, it comes with all these different parts and it just seems like something you can&#x27;t go wrong with, so I bought it. I have been trying to make it work for a month now and I still can&#x27;t seem to get the results I want. It seems to cut the hair rather than actually remove it from the roots. I have tried all the different head pieces and the only one I have got to work was the larger piece, the one used for arms and legs, yet it hurt like hell. I thought using it while in the shower or in the bath would help with the pain but it didn&#x27;t. The shaving piece cuts the hair but does not bring it down to the height of a normal shaving tool, it is just something you can use to trim hair. The piece with the smaller tip has a protective silver metal attachment on top of it which stops the tweezers from being able to reach the hair making it not useful at all. The foot care attachment was something I actually loved but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth keeping such an expensive product for one attachment. If the product only caused pain but worked, I wouldn&#x27;t mind, but I&#x27;m having trouble using it and having trouble with the pain so I don&#x27;t see a reason for it. This is not my first epilator, I had a &amp;#34;Braun skill-epil 3&amp;#34; and it is amazing. I have never had any trouble with it, it is less painful and works very fast. The only reason I bought a new one was because I moved to a different country with different voltages meaning I can&#x27;t use it. All in all, I do not recommend this product, it takes a lot of time ( is not something you can do 20 minutes before going to school or work), is very painful, and is just not the best option. I prefer using wax than this, wax is less painful and takes less time.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality item and is well worth the cost and beyond. I was surprised to feel no pain with initial use and the battery has excellent life and charges quickly. The pedi attachment is well worth the price itself!!! Its easy to operate and the instructions explain everything in a thorough and simple manor.</li>
    <li> This works great! It actually grabs and pulls the entire hair out, I have heard of some that just rip the hair. This gets the entire hair, root and all. I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet, just dry. I always use baby powder on my skin and the epilator works quick and it&#x27;s really not that bad once you get used to it.</li>
    <li> So worth the money the attachments are great. Yes it hurts, your pulling all your hair out. But on a scale of cheap to smooth this is on the smoother side. The head flexes that alone is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a different brand before this but I was getting infected ingrown hairs. Because this is wet dry and my other one wasn&#x27;t, I can do a quick wash between uses and I haven&#x27;t had a single ingrown hair with it.</li>
    <li> Love it been hair free for two weeks</li>
    <li> I love it, I use it all of the time.</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing. Works well.</li>
    <li> Fabulous epilator, catches the tiniest hair, quick &amp; easy</li>
    <li> Overly complicated and as such was not used. Will give it to someone who has the time and the trial and error mentality.</li>
    <li> Great epilator! I specially love the LED light in the front to illuminate hard-to-see hair. So happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing fancy about this epilator. I think it would be better to invest in a good quality razor from CVS Or Rite Aid. Seriously the worst investment ever. I have only used it few times and every time I use it my hair grows back the next day (no I am not that hairy) but this device only shaves hair from the very top surface and that&#x27;s all. I am currently using Olay &#x27;s 5 blade razor and that works like a charm. My advice is to either stick to waxing or get a good quality razor.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I just opened the package and tried out the epilation head. Wow!!! It was amazing! So easy, so effective, so FAST!!! Somehow less painful then others (don&#x27;t know how!). And it was FUN!! Like seriously, I was giggling! The head tilts slightly adjusting to the movement along your legs. It&#x27;s just so smooth! I loved it so much I wanted to buy it as gifts for my girl friends! :D&lt;br /&gt;I hope the other pieces are as awesome once I try them out.&lt;br /&gt;And hope you have a good experience with it too</li>
    <li> My wife loves this. Got it for her for x-mas. Extremely painful at first apparently! But eventually it gets easier and easier. She definitely recommends it.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator. I can&#x27;t compare it to any others, but this thing works. I have used all of the attachment heads and was impressed with every one. It hurts. There&#x27;s no denying that and I have a high pain tolerance. But this is so much better than waxing. No mess, you can do little areas at a time instead of large strips, it only pulls out hair and not your skin, and the hair stays away just as long. This epilator pulled all of my hair out by the root from my armpits, arms, legs, and even bikini area. I am very impressed and well never go back to razors!</li>
    <li> Love this and my legs are so smooth.  One downfall as the hair become finer and they do become finer (don&#x27;t let anyone tell you otherwise) the tweezer fail to get the hairs that are ones and twos in the areas.  You will need a finer epilater for that or just shave the rest.  I do weekly maintenance but that is getting less and less frequent.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love, great alternative for shaving, plus all the interchangeable heads meets all my needs for sensitivity, and foot care I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to make the switch from shaving or waxing.</li>
    <li> I lost my previous epilator of  a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the preferred review of this one I bought it. How am I happy I lost the previous one. VERY MUCH SO. This epilator is so much better and with the two rollers it does an incredible job. It does not pinch the skin like the other one use to do. And it is even painless in comparison. I did my under arm with ease and not much pain. I had not shaved in three weeks so I was a bit scared, It was quick and efficient. I removed the cover of the rollers and it works even better for my taste.  I really love it. I have not tried all the accesories. But the double roller is my tool. Waiting for the next time I can use it. :0)</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Yes it hurts and some places of the body hurt more than others but both epilator heads work great and my legs have been smooth for over a week from one session. The electric razor and foot pumice heads also work great too. I have never epilated before and I am satisfied with this device.</li>
