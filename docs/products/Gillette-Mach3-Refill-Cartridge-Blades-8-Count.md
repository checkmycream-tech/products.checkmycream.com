      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>Used for many years.</li>

      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite since....</li>
      <li>Authentic as they come.</li>
      <li>Prices are high but delivery was great.</li>
      <li>Pretty good price for blades</li>
      <li>I know they&#x27;ve come out with new products since, but this works great for me.</li>
      <li>Great and completely as described.</li>
      <li>You need the tried and true Mach3!</li>
      <li>Anything I need they have and shipping is free,</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve been comfortable with and without shaving cream</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Mach3 since I got a free promotional Mach3 razor for fulfilling my obilgation to register with the Selective Service.</li>
      <li>Genuine blades @ a discount price.</li>
      <li>The shave is close and smooth.</li>
      <li>Great razor, it&#x27;s the only one my husband will use.</li>
      <li>: Provides a smooth clean shave in one stroke.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you get the real thing and not some knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>More to the point, I have been lucky to get 5 days out of these blades, while the CVS blades usually last 7-9 days and give me a much more comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>Received item very quickly and package was intact and exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I use these when I travel, but otherwise greatly prefer the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; double edge blades and real shaving soap.</li>
      <li>Ok, I gave the seller, a high five star rating for shipping and packaging on amazon.com&#x27;s feedback page.  </li>
      <li>Gillette&#x27;s biggest challenge is coming up with new, better products.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>A bit pricy but worth the money.</li>
      <li>The company quickly refunded our money and shipping costs but does not make up for the fact this product is evidently an inferior reproduction.  </li>
      <li>Clean shave, last longer than most razors</li>
      <li>Sharp and good quality blades.</li>
      <li>They do fit the razors and appear to be new.</li>
      <li>Good value, much less than would have paid in l8cal drug store.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it should</li>
      <li>I am still using my first one and it shaves well no problems.</li>
      <li>These work better than the newer 5 bladed ones for my purpose, especially when shaving one&#x27;s head..</li>
      <li>The back of the box has several different foreign languages more so than what has been on the original box from the U.S.A.  Shop and Save LTD states, &amp;#34;they strive to bring you the best deals, lowest prices and lowest postage rates.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>These blades made in Brazil are as good, if not better, than ones made in the USA.</li>
      <li>but I make sure I dry it off and store it away after each use.</li>
      <li>And a trick I learned listening to Clark Howard: dry off the blade after each use and it lasts many times longer.</li>
      <li>Much smoother shave and the blades last a good while if you keep them dry.</li>
      <li>but I really needed to shave the day they came in</li>
      <li>the shave is much closer than anything you&#x27;ll get with electric.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great price, my husband love them.</li>
    <li> These shaving blades are much much better then the single or double blade system. A bit pricy but worth the money. I use one blade for literally months without having to replace it but I make sure I dry it off and store it away after each use.</li>
    <li> Good product, great price.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price of these online, same blade and same quality as the ones in stores.</li>
    <li> I have use these for years. Much better to buy them online then to go to the drugstore and get tased just to get them.</li>
    <li> Due to the exorbitant pricing of their Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridges, which last a week, and cost four dollars a cartridge, I thought I would use my old Mach3 razor stick as its cartridges are about half the cost, and when I last used them a few years ago, they had lasted me a full month. Much to my dismay, I found that Gillette, after flooding the market with their Mach3s that lasted a month, have now adroitly reduced the quality of the Mach3 razor cartridge to where it too, like its pricier cousin, the Proglide, lasts about a week. My solution is to go back to my Schick cartridges, and after they finish, I am sending for a double edged razor and safety razor blades so I can get some decent mileage for my money. These Gillette products are meant for those whose idea of class lies in throwing money down the drain. It doesn&#x27;t take a genius to see the manufacturer is taking for a ride all those who want to be taken.</li>
    <li> Unbeatable price! They are same product that I bought from retail stores except price is much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Definitely good value for money. I now know where to  purchase the Mach3 cartridge blades.</li>
    <li> I am still using my first one and it shaves well no problems.</li>
    <li> So nice..very good deal..</li>
    <li> Pretty good price for blades</li>
    <li> Razor? Well they shave</li>
    <li> fast delivery, new and never opened</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase! Quick shipping too!!</li>
    <li> A shaving requirement</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> excellent value, came quicky</li>
    <li> even though packages were sealed, blades don&#x27;t seem very sharp. They do fit the razors and appear to be new.</li>
    <li> Descent value for my old faithful blade...</li>
    <li> does the job well.. very happy with product</li>
    <li> Excellent price for these blades.</li>
    <li> Great razor! I&#x27;m Italian, girlie razors don&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> Always the best razors</li>
    <li> very good price for the blades. half the store cost.</li>
    <li> Great for shave! Been using them for years.</li>
    <li> great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Received today-2 packs of 4 blades each. Made in Brazil, not the normal US product. I have not tried the blades yet but am skeptical. They could be good or not. The manufacture date was May 12, 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Friday morning Feb 27:  Tried a Brazilian blade and it did not shave as well as the month old U.S. made Mach 3 that it replaced.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the purchase</li>
    <li> I use this kind all the time</li>
    <li> Like everyone else here, I was trying to save a few dollars on razor blades and thought I would scout out what Amazon had to offer.  Beware!  These blades are not as sharp and do not last as long as the Gillette blades you get  -- for more money, of course -- through CVS.  I don&#x27;t know why, but I have tried three sets of them now and the experience has been uniformly poor.  The shave is not as close, it is rougher and can be uncomfortable, and the blades simply do not last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Why?  I don&#x27;t have a clue.  One of the prior reviewers suggested these blades are made overseas to less exacting quality standards.  Could be.  I just know that this morning I popped out one of these blades (3 days old) and put in a Mach 3 blade purchased rom CVS and the difference was very noticeable.  More to the point, I have been lucky to get 5 days out of these blades, while the CVS blades usually last 7-9 days and give me a much more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and prompt delivery.  Didn&#x27;t have to wait for a clerk to open the darn case.</li>
    <li> These blades made in Brazil are as good, if not better, than ones made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Had Spanish writing on package, terrible quality, says made in brazil. Not sure where the ones I buy in the store are made but deffinately not same quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mach3 razors for years. The shave is close and smooth. I switch out to new blades every two weeks or so, whenever the blue strip fades. They&#x27;ve been comfortable with and without shaving cream (I sometimes just use water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using four and five blades razors but noticed no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully recommend the \\&quot;Mach 3 Razor.\\&quot; Just make sure you get the real thing and not some knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Trendl&lt;br /&gt;anthonytrendl.com</li>
    <li> These are from Mexico. Not the same quality as u get in US!!</li>
    <li> Good value, much less than would have paid in l8cal drug store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using them for years, I believe they are the best.</li>
    <li> PPP&#x3D;Perfectly pleasing purchase</li>
    <li> Excellent Buy very pleased!</li>
    <li> It does the job. Yay!</li>
    <li> The blades are not those sold in US stores - they were made in India, apparently for the Polish market.</li>
    <li> Goes well with the razor I bought</li>
    <li> They were exactly as I expected them to be. The blades are sharp and they do they job. Love them.</li>
    <li> The package received does not match the picture (looks like it&#x27;s from India) but the razors fit and provide a good shave.  Did find that I could have bought it cheaper on eBay.</li>
    <li> There is something wrong with these blades. They are not Gillette as the picture implies. I have been a Gillette user for 25 years and I have never had such razor burn. I have switched blades twice in less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE RAZORS ARE JUNK AND KNOCKOFFS!!!!</li>
    <li> Great refils at a great price. I love my Amazon Prime. Anything I need they have and shipping is free,</li>
    <li> These must have been Chinese knock offs or taken from the rejection bin at Gillette.  They start to pull and tug almost immediately and none have lasted longer than 5 shaves before being so dull their worthless.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Much better than other women&#x27;s razors on the Market.  Less waste than disposable razors.</li>
    <li> These were not the ones you buy at a store in the USA, they were from Brazil. Annoyed but I really needed to shave the day they came in and they worked fine, I&#x27;m not really a razor expert so I can&#x27;t really tell what I&#x27;m missing out on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still ripped off though, bought these because they were a couple bucks cheaper than Target, I could&#x27;ve gotten knock-offs somewhere else for half the price.</li>
    <li> These work better than the newer 5 bladed ones for my purpose, especially when shaving one&#x27;s head.. They don&#x27;t plug up like the others!</li>
    <li> easier to buy from amazon than a trip to the store.  I had been using these for a while and like them</li>
    <li> The blades delivered were NOT real Mach3 blades. They are poor quality and not the same as what you find at the store. Perhaps they are factory seconds, if not just total fakes. The lubricating strip melts away completely after about three uses, which is not the case with the real blades, and the quality of the shave is poor. This seller shouldn&#x27;t be claiming these are the real blades when they are not.</li>
    <li> The blades work just fine, as expected.  But, the package says that it is meant to be sold in India.  I am not sure if it is even legal to be selling these here in the US.</li>
    <li> Used for many years. Can not go wrong.</li>
    <li> Works as a charm. I have been using these for years and I love them. Much cheaper than buying them at a regular store.</li>
    <li> Husband didn&#x27;t notice a difference but I did notice they weren&#x27;t made in USA like package lead me to believe.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers this brand and it is less expensive and certainly more conveniet to purchase them through Amazon</li>
    <li> I in 5 blades is of low quality resulting in causing nicks and cuts on my face.</li>
    <li> Ok, I gave the seller, a high five star rating for shipping and packaging on amazon.com&#x27;s feedback page.  The item came from China and the box is not &amp;#34;EXACTLY&amp;#34; like the one shown on the box they advertise.  On the front the box states inside a yellow border &amp;#34;Improved DLC Blades&amp;#34; and it states the same on the back adding &amp;#34;comfort edges for effortless glide&amp;#34; and my husband used one from this box received and the triple blades pulled and cut into his face giving a very rough edged cut.  He hates it and he always used Gillette Mach 3 in the past and I do not believe this seller is selling original blades.  The back of the box has several different foreign languages more so than what has been on the original box from the U.S.A.  Shop and Save LTD states, &amp;#34;they strive to bring you the best deals, lowest prices and lowest postage rates. We directly source quality products from all over the world to ensure the best quality and price.&amp;#34;  Well, the quality is quite poor as is evident on my husband&#x27;s right out of the box first use.  This is absolutely NOT quality merchandise.</li>
    <li> Product is as expected.</li>
    <li> Great price, and I didn&#x27;t even have to leave the house you gotta love that</li>
    <li> Exactly the same product you can buy in groceries stores at a cheaper price.  I have been using the Mach3 for nearly a decide and have never had any issues.  My wife prefers the Mach3 over any of the lady razors she has tried.</li>
    <li> The blades work well for the price</li>
    <li> Blades work just like those I buy locally and I get about twice as many for the price.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Product is perfect</li>
    <li> I have used these for more than 20 years and cannot find a better choice.  Buy them.</li>
    <li> Always buy this for my husband ....best price ever ......he loves the way his skin feel after shave....</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband. It&#x27;s the only one he buys.</li>
    <li> all was on time and everything was great</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. I know they&#x27;ve come out with new products since, but this works great for me. And a trick I learned listening to Clark Howard: dry off the blade after each use and it lasts many times longer. The fact is its dampness that wears out the blade--more than use. Gillette&#x27;s biggest challenge is coming up with new, better products. They&#x27;re trying to solve a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist: the Mach3 is perfect. the shave is much closer than anything you&#x27;ll get with electric. And the blade beats all competitors.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the item pictured.  The photo shows an 8-pack of Gillette Mach 3 refills.  I received two 4 packs (separate packaging).  In addition, the refills I received are MADE IN BRAZIL and all of the text on the box is in a foreign language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that the price is great and at the end of the day it&#x27;s still a Gillette product, but I should have been aware of this prior to making the purchase.  Please change the photo to ensure that your customers are not surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of quality, time will tell.  I will update this review with a comparison between these blades and my previous Mach 3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The quality of the blades is the same as other Mach3 refills I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> This are the real deal.</li>
    <li> These are HORRIBLE and came in Gillette packaging, but they all were very dull and didn&#x27;t seem to live up to Gillette quality.  I used 4 of them and threw the rest in the garbage.  Go and buy the real thing at your local Walmart or Target....these are CRAP!!!</li>
    <li> Although I can&#x27;t prove it, I think these blades are &amp;#34;knock-offs&amp;#34;. No where on the package do I see anything written in English. When I tried using these blades they felt like using and old rusty butter knife that had been buried in dirt (not that I have ever used such thing). It hurt and scraped. I tried 2 and threw them all in the trash!</li>
    <li> STILL too expensive for razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I maintain these for odds and ends while shaving with an old fashioned safety razor. If you&#x27;re young and haven&#x27;t tried a brush and double-sided safety razor, you SHOULD.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t Mach 3 blades. They&#x27;re in a knockoff package and completely tore up my face. They&#x27;re the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine of razor blades.</li>
    <li> Decent enough blades, but grossly overpriced. I use these when I travel, but otherwise greatly prefer the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; double edge blades and real shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Why are these being sold in packages from Brazil? Definately different than what is advertised.</li>
    <li> other than the boxes being printed in Spanish these blades are exactly like the one&#x27;s i&#x27;ve been buying locally, only less expensive. NO complaints</li>
    <li> no problem, quick, good vallue</li>
    <li> Best blades on the market</li>
    <li> Class blades for the Mach 3 razor. I love this razor.</li>
    <li> Good but the ones I got were in Spanish and seemed a little less sharp like no aloe shield or something. Still best bang for buck</li>
    <li> I guess they are really sharp and do the job for him, not for me</li>
    <li> More is not always better, I tried four blades and been using these for years and I&#x27;m smoother than an android&#x27;s bottom. Clean shave with little or no drag or irritation.</li>
    <li> The blade bends down where it is hard to use. I will have to see what the rest of the  blades do.</li>
    <li> These are just as good as what is in the store!  I saved a few dollars which is always nice with these pricey things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Genuine blades @ a discount price. Great!</li>
    <li> Just like the American Mach 3 blades for a lot less $.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using these for years.  Can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> This appears to be a dull knock off of the Gillette Mach 3.  The company quickly refunded our money and shipping costs but does not make up for the fact this product is evidently an inferior reproduction.  Am reporting also to Amazon. If there were no stars, I would have done that!  DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> Made in India junk...It has price in Rupees. Do not buy!!</li>
    <li> Had been using a monthly subscription service, but didn&#x27;t get as close a shave so I swapped back to Mach3 through Amazon. Much smoother shave and the blades last a good while if you keep them dry.</li>
    <li> Great and completely as described.</li>
    <li> Prices are high but delivery was great.</li>
    <li> Clean shave, last longer than most razors</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, Great price</li>
    <li> Received item very quickly and package was intact and exactly as described. Great razor, it&#x27;s the only one my husband will use.</li>
    <li> Fake, counterfeit product, do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> They shave pretty decently for a decent price.</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette Mach3 blades for MANY years and this is the first time that i got a bad &amp;#34;batch&amp;#34;.  Blades typically stay sharp for weeks, however this shipment only holds sharpness for 3 - 4 days.  Somebody fell down in their quality control department!</li>
    <li> wish they were cheaper</li>
    <li> Top notch.  I got 8 for the price of 5 at the store.  Authentic as they come.</li>
    <li> Product as described in new package.</li>
    <li> I keep buying these because they simply work.</li>
    <li> I ordered this may 26th and I still don&#x27;t have them today June 27th. I was just notified 2 day&#x27;s ago that it&#x27;s at the post office because I have to sign for it.</li>
    <li> Perfect job woriks well gives a close shve, used for many years</li>
    <li> Got this for the hubby.  He said they don&#x27;t last as long as the first one he bought. Hey it does its job, it just wont last as long. Wont buy again.</li>
    <li> Sharp and good quality blades. Sharpness lasts long!!</li>
    <li> the original, and only blade my husband will use</li>
    <li> These are fairly decent blades and are a little cheaper than the Mach 3 cartridges available in my local pharmacy - but they are a slightly lesser quality.  They appear to be grey market blades from Brazil and not made for sale in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also don&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as the regular Gillette Mach 3 blades before they start to get dull - I&#x27;d guess one week before a marked decline of quality sets in even though I dry them after each use. The package states in Portuguese that the blades are good for up to four months - even the Mach 3 blades I buy in my local pharmacy don&#x27;t last that long. I&#x27;m a little disappointed in these and after I use them up I&#x27;ll shop around for non-grey market blades</li>
    <li> Holy crap I love to shave! If you need a close shave, don&#x27;t mess with those silly curve to your face shavers on TV these days. You need the tried and true Mach3! You&#x27;ll get a shave so close that you will think you are a pre-teen all over again!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It does exactly what it says it should: Provides a smooth clean shave in one stroke. I&#x27;ve tested other shavers but in general I&#x27;ve found that this one delivers. You can&#x27;t get this close of a shave with an at electric so for that alone it&#x27;s worth it. I try to remember to clean and dry my blades off as much as possible to keep the blades around as much as I can.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and way cheaper than at the store</li>
    <li> This is my favorite since....</li>
    <li> Good products and great prices</li>
    <li> Great price for refill cartridges.</li>
    <li> Great value and the turn around was awesome!</li>
    <li> Really bad !!! Very old product manufactured in early 2014, and made in India (People normally would want to buy Gillette from US and get it to India, this shipper has shipped an India manufactured product)</li>
    <li> The were expired when I received them.</li>
    <li> very disappointed  it appears they are not like the usa  product  will not buy again</li>
    <li> Good blades, good price, good delivery.</li>
    <li> Inferior product, VERY dull blades from the start!</li>
    <li> great product, will buy again...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mach3 since I got a free promotional Mach3 razor for fulfilling my obilgation to register with the Selective Service. That was 14 years ago. They work great!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as advertised</li>
    <li> geat value over store prices</li>
    <li> Husband always uses these blades. Cheaper than stores.</li>
    <li> these are great blades, nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> great price excellent shaver</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Product just as described, and fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
