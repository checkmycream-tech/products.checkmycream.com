      <li>these are so great as compared to spending many many minutes with tweezers in front of the mirror.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a bit of germophobe like me, then you keep a bottle of alcohol handy to sanitize your beauty tools.  </li>

      <li>I notice hairs on my lower face, I&#x27;m am lucky that they are a fair color and very fine</li>
      <li>but you roll it outwards to basically reset it so it can grab more hair.</li>
      <li>Ok, places I&#x27;ve used it: Face, it&#x27;s removed 100% of fuzz and a group of eye brows and lashes because I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>nearly as many</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t compare to a tweezer as I have been tweezing my eyebrows since I was a teen&lt;br /&gt;&amp; don&#x27;t remember if it hurt any more,</li>
      <li>I guess if I stock up on them it would still be better than plucking</li>
      <li>Took some time to get use to using, but it&#x27;s getting better.</li>
      <li>I am getting the more</li>
      <li>Love these things.</li>
      <li>This tool is okay for any hairs over the lip or strays on the face but does not work well on chin hairs or the neck.</li>
      <li>For what this is suppose to do, it works OK.  </li>
      <li>though coa i got a tweezer instead and that works much better than this..</li>
      <li>but I did get the top part.</li>
      <li>For me, the wax strips work much better.</li>
      <li>it really works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just writing more because I have 5 more words required.</li>
      <li>This gives you more control.  </li>
      <li>It is better to use a depilatory or waxing.</li>
      <li>This is ok</li>
      <li>It hurts, but it was able to pull out some thicker hairs.  </li>
      <li>and I think that that one works better for the thinker and finer hairs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You may be trying to decide whether to purchase such a silly looking item right now, and I say do it! I was awfully skeptical, but these things work. I&#x27;ve used creams and wax to remove facial hair and always end up with red splotches and irritation. I have sensitive, fair skin and I have to be super careful with what I use for hair removal. This thing is great! Removes the tiniest of hairs and leaves my skin smooth. I do experience a bit of redness obviously from pulling hair out, but it subsides quickly and here is no lon-lasting irritation. It&#x27;s crazy how well this tool works and I&#x27;ve been telling all my girlfriends about it! I&#x27;m simply amazed and won&#x27;t use anything else on my face now.</li>
    <li> I tried it a few times and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work :( I will probably need to use another method or a better quality. The &#x27;old&#x27; question is: will an expensive one will be better?</li>
    <li> Hurts terribly the first few times I used it, but I didn&#x27;t get any weird bumps, just tenderness.  It&#x27;s kind of picky about which hairs it grabs, especially after prolonged use but they are cheap to replace and I like them.  Seems to work better than shaving, regular plucking, or anything drastic like waxing.</li>
    <li> I got these for removing hair above my upper lip. I don&#x27;t wax because my skin ends up breaking out! I always have to pluck, and there is just too much hair to do that regularly so I ended up shaving it and plucking the darker ones &#x3D;\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool is really great. It removes a lot of hair at once (you still have to do multiple passes on the same area). Just bend and twist as you roll it over. There is some pinching as the hairs come out, just what you&#x27;d expect, but not as bad as plucking just because you don&#x27;t have to do it nearly as many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this maybe once a week. Great purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why it came with 2; I will probably give the 2nd to a friend.</li>
    <li> When I looked at the directions I was disappointed because the directions were not in English and I had no idea how to use it. However, I was able to find a YouTube video on how to use the threader correctly: [...]&lt;br /&gt;April does a great job explaining how to use the facial threader.  It&#x27;s very simple to use and if you have ever used  tweezers before the pain is about the same, but the great thing is, is that the \\&quot;Facial Hair Remover Threading Beauty Tool\\&quot; is much FASTER!!!  And it only cost me $4.99 for two!!!  It&#x27;s an awesome product at a great price!</li>
    <li> In the beginning it is painful however, once you adjust it&#x27;s not so bad. The hair doesn&#x27;t grow as quickly as before and it&#x27;s safer that methods that I have used in hte past.</li>
    <li> Love it , the only real \\&quot;pain\\&quot; where my eyes got wattery was around the mustache area. My face has a lot of little hairs around my side burn area and under chin so this device was awesome for it. I never have time to go wax and this grabs its all! Definatley reccommend for someone who doesn&#x27;t always have time to go to thr salon before they close and can handle a little pain, and someone who wants to save money! Super easy to use and got it real fast like always.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and product exactly as described! There are two tools that come in the package and even though each of them are different they still work well.  The one with the pink handles works slightly better.</li>
    <li> Until know i dont know how to use it .......</li>
    <li> Good product but I thought that they were two different sizes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This product is not worth it. Get&#x27;s some hair but takes to long to get any. The hairs you see and want to get, don&#x27;t get pulled. Works on little hairs you can&#x27;t really see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried and tried to get this to work,but, with no success. It is better to use a depilatory or waxing. The waxing hurts but at least it gets it out at once.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t figure out how this gadget is suppose to work? Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Does the job!!! I order this for my sister in law and mom.  It&#x27;s works the same like the rim. They are all the same just need to hold both ends shape it like a u and swivel until you feel it grab your hair.  It even pulls the smallest thinnest hairs.</li>
    <li> It is a really good product. It got all my chin hairs, facial hairs etc lol. It takes it up by the root, so you can even see the root of the hair. It shipped very fast as well.</li>
    <li> Very cool! It totally works and is fun to use! A+</li>
    <li> here&#x27;s the thing...  i am no stranger to hair removal.  i began getting regular brow waxes in 4th grade until i was brave enough to tweeze myself.  in middle school, i started getting lip waxes.  in high school, i purchased my own wax machine to do both lip and brow waxes my self and even began doing my own underarm waxing myself a few years ago (anyone who&#x27;s ever tried that themselves knows how badly that hurts!).  NONE of those things are anywhere as painful as this, nor do they take anywhere near as long.  i purchased this b/c my wax machine was damaged during my move and didn&#x27;t want to keep paying someone to do something i knew i could until i was reimbursed from the moving company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;point being, i would take three seconds of pain twice (once for each side of the lip) than three seconds of pain 100 times b/c it only pulls a few hairs out at a time!  does it pull hair out?  yes.  but not how you&#x27;d think or like.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it, easy to use and not painful at all!!! Amazing!!! If you didn&#x27;t buy this product yet, just buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I like this facial hair remover tool because it removes your hair from the root.  It&#x27;s fast and easy to do. Of course you will feel a little pain when removing but remember pain is beauty.</li>
    <li> I had never used the whole spring thing before these. I have used regular razors, electric razors, tweezers, depilatory creams, wax and an epilator. In my experience, these don&#x27;t hurt any more than other methods where ripping hair out of your skin/flesh is involved. On the plus side, you can get a group of hairs at once- as opposed to tweezing- so it&#x27;s a group hurt and not a lot of little hurts... for me that makes it seem less painful. It only took me about 5 minutes to figure out how this works. Just bend, twist and move it up and down on your cheek for a minute... you&#x27;ll know when it works, then you can move to whatever area you need and you will know how to hold it. I suggested the cheek because I have a bunch of fine little hairs on my cheek near my jawline (luckily they are blonde!) and it&#x27;s a good angle to learn to hold this tool at so after a minute of swirling and moving it was easy to tell when it worked. This is not really made for precision plucking (like eyebrows) I&#x27;d consider you pretty brave if you tried to shape your brows with this. I do have fine blonde hairs between my eyebrows and this worked perfectly there, I usually don&#x27;t tweeze them, you can&#x27;t see them unless you try, but I figured since I have these springs I&#x27;d give it a try. I tried it on my legs, because I was bored, but couldn&#x27;t seem to get a good enough angle to really get going with it. I&#x27;d recommend this set to anyone who wants to give these a try without breaking the bank. You get two for less than the price of one (of some other brands).</li>
    <li> For what this is suppose to do, it works OK.  You have to bend and roll until you can figure out how the hair is pulled out.  Takes a couple of times (each time)to figure it out.  It&#x27;s better than using the sticky facial hair removers that leave you face red and sticky.  The hair does seem to grow back a little quicker though.  It&#x27;s small enough to take traveling too.</li>
    <li> I actually looked up how to use the spring tool on You Tube before deciding to buy.  The product I received was packaged in non-English packaging, so I have no clue on how to clean the instrument.  I&#x27;m assuming alcohol.  It hurts, but it was able to pull out some thicker hairs.  Worth at least trying.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using bellabe with great results.  thought i would buy this as it was cheaper.  after all it&#x27;s just a spring right?  wrong.  the spaces in between are not the same it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  totally wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Ordered for myself to use. My aunt introduced it to me. Easy to use. My face is not that sensitive, works great! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> You can buy this for a few dollars on eBay and it works much better than this one.</li>
    <li> but it&#x27;s completely worth it. Cheap alternative to waxing or threading. Can&#x27;t beat that the price is for the two tools. Love it.</li>
    <li> Painful but does the job well once you figure it out.</li>
    <li> very helpful and portable</li>
    <li> ****UPDATE**** 7/20/12 from 5 stars to 3 stars****After using for a few weeks it no longer grabs the hairs. Disappointing! I guess if I stock up on them it would still be better than plucking but i think i will be saving my $ :((&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because I an sick of plucking. The first day I tried using it and it took 30min to get the hang of it. Now im hooked! I sit and watch TV while doing it lol. But, I will say some areas do not hurt, other areas hurt like HELL!Like the upper lip under your nose.</li>
    <li> Thought about taking a star off for pain, but that hardly seems fair. ;)  This works!  I use it on my upper lip.  I do have to stop and start and go over it because it hurts.  Weirdly, it&#x27;s addictive and you do kind of get used to it.  I read other comments and using it in a small &amp;#34;n&amp;#34; (or upside down &amp;#34;u&amp;#34;) shape and rolling both handles inwards towards each other is most effective.  As is keeping an ice cube close by.</li>
    <li> Better Than Tweezing for facial hair. Similar to technique used in Asia for whole-face hair removal.  Quick, clean and inexpensive, this tool is very useful.</li>
    <li> Okay, I ordered this the last week in April (can&#x27;t remember the date exactly) and got it May 4th so that&#x27;s good. It comes with two hair remover tools. The one with the light pink ends comes in a totally different language. I think Japanese. It works well but not so good on the thicker hairs but I will use it anyways. The other one with the dark pink ends is called GOHO and I think that that one works better for the thinker and finer hairs. It doesn&#x27;t take long to figure how to work it BUT like plucking hairs it does hurt, so beware. If you look in the GOHO black tube it comes in there are directions on paper that are in English and tell you how to use it and clean it, so you don&#x27;t need to go on the internet to find instructions on it. If you can tolerate the pain I would recommend that you buy it just to try it out. Just don&#x27;t forget the directions are in the black GOHO tube. I think I&#x27;m going to get some oragel and put it on my face to numb it first and then try it out. haha :)</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time yesterday and I am soooo glad I decided to get it.  My skin was less irritated and not as red compared to waxing.  As other reviewers have said I think it will go faster after I have more practice using it but I love the cost and convenience of this. The convenience is that I don&#x27;t need to wait and schedule a waxing appointment and can use it when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> It is a great product for facial hairs. Once I started using it, I have stopped threading or tweezing. It is easy to use, does hurt at first but you will get used to it.</li>
    <li> works pretty well but not as good as the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover</li>
    <li> Every Woman needs these!</li>
    <li> great hair removal. might have to go over areas a few times but other than that, great tool with a great price.</li>
    <li> works well on chin.  It really hurts around the lip area (naturally)!  Better than facial hair removing creams that cost so much money and cause facial irritation!</li>
    <li> It does not remove hair from the root, it tends to break mine off.</li>
    <li> the seller of this product had great service but the product takes a while to learn to use and has mediorcore results.</li>
    <li> I tried using it, I don&#x27;t think I have the hang of it yet.  An instructional video would be nice.  I bought it on Prime day, and read the reviews. Most of them were positive so I figured I would give it a shot.  I bought it for my eyebrows...but I definitely would not use it on them.  I am afraid I would accidentally remove half my eye brow.  They are more for cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I love this product...once I got the hang of it it use it every day....it is actually addicting!  You bend the wand into a U shape and then twist the handler bars with your fingers while holding the wand in a U shape!</li>
    <li> Other purchasers said that this feels the same as tweezing.  I disagree.  The instructions say you may feel a tingling sensation. That&#x27;s not tingling, it&#x27;s pain.  I&#x27;m going back to tweezing, which does not hurt.</li>
    <li> at first i could never be able to remove hair and after watching a few youtube toturials i am better at and its amazing !</li>
    <li> Works great but hurts</li>
    <li> I use this every few weeks and it clears up unwanted facial hair. If you have a low tolerance for pain I suggest a different product.</li>
    <li> I have owned the Bellabe and Epistick versions of these facial hair removers.  I can say that this product is up to par with the Bellabe and Epistick.  The price is terrific and you get two sticks, too.  Cheap and reliable!</li>
    <li> These threading tools sounded like a good idea, but I saw literally no result from using them.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend them. I&#x27;m going back to my tweezers!</li>
    <li> It grabs you hair but if it is too short it will not pull it out.  I have this one hair under my chin that I pluck about once a month.  I though this would be perfect for a quick pull out.  It grips the hair but when I pull it it let&#x27;s it go.  I tried it on a longer head hair and it pulls it out perfectly.  LOL I do not want to wait until the pesky chin strand grows as long as a head hair. if you have hairs longer than an inch go ahead an buy this, works great but if you are like most people who want to pull out shorter hairs, I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> this did not work , hard to use instructions hard to understand I would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Works to remove fine hair on upper lip, not too painful after getting used to it. Not as bad as waxing.</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to, but it works. Keep it clean by swabbing with alcohol after every few uses and it&#x27;ll last longer/won&#x27;t muck up your complexion.</li>
    <li> they do the job. If you know how to use them that is. You should feel some pain and the result is smooth chin, cheeks, upper lip, sideburns and face in general. I don&#x27;t recommend using this around your eyebrows though. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This is so easy, I usually use the tool while sitting down watching tv. No irritation to the skin, might hurt a little a first, but once your skin warms up it smooth sailing.</li>
    <li> For me, the dark handled one works like a dream (been using it for over 6 months)... The light handled one not so well.  Still worth buying for the dark handled one (although I see you can also buy it by itself).  Once you get the hang of using it, you will not go back to tweezers!</li>
    <li> I love how easy it is to use.  A few minutes and the hair is gone.  I liked it so much I bought more to give away to friends.  There are plenty of how to videos on You-Tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these springy hair removers for years.  These particulars ones with the nubby handles are the best.  The space between the wires catch the hairs better.  I&#x27;ve noticed some complaints about these not working.  Allow me to offer a little tutorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold it in a U-shape, on the spring itself, closer to where the plucking will happen.  This gives you more control.  Roll it across the hairy area while turning the spring like a wheel.  The instant you feel it grab onto a hair - FREEZE!  Holding that same position, PULL (don&#x27;t roll) in the opposite direction from which you were rolling.  For example, if you are rolling upward and catch a hair, STOP and gently pull downward holding the spring in the exact same position.  If you are rolling down to the right and catch a hair, pull up to the left to pluck it.  Roll back, forth, up, down, diagonal in many directions using this method and your hairy places will soon be smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. Be sure to read the instructions inside though! I read a comment that said to just roll inwards which works but you roll it outwards to basically reset it so it can grab more hair. It hurts a lot! But not seeing facial hair and knowing it&#x27;ll take longer to come back in is worth it!</li>
    <li> It removes facial hair, and does it very well. It isn&#x27;t pretty, fancy or expensive, but it removes facial hair very nicely. My face is quite smooth when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if these were going to work at first but they are grrrreat!!! I convinced my sisters to order them as well. I give it 4 stars only because mine had a stain on it when I received it.</li>
    <li> The best little trimmer tool ever. A must have. To say that this doesn&#x27;t hurt would be a complete lie, but once you get used to it your done trimming. So I feel this is worth the discomfort.</li>
    <li> This works great above the lips!&lt;br /&gt;The instructions says not to use it on eyebrows, but I used it between my husband&#x27;s eyebrows. You just have to be VERY careful.</li>
    <li> This thing really works! It came about a week and I immediately try.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little painful when I first use it, but I soon get use to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for quite awhile. Even though I broke one, I had another back up so that was great.</li>
    <li> Never used one of these before, but it works!  The &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; is not that bad and makes you feel like you are successful in pulling out hairs.  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; pain.  I would recommend trying this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this instead of the Bellabe brand that I have used for years.... bad choice on my part.  This product does not grab all the little hairs that the Bellabe gets... Spend a little more and get the real thing, it&#x27;ll save you money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I thought this would work but end up being disappointed.  It stinks, swells the face and doesn&#x27;t get everything. You have to spend hours to get the hair.  If you have chin hair, this won&#x27;t work at all, still had to tweeze. After a month of use I stopped. The hair grew back thicker and blacker than ever! I just gave up!</li>
    <li> These are great. I was nervous about getting these since they are cheaper than some others out there but they work great. It does hurt but its a lot better than trying to pluck the hair from your upper lip, and waxing irritates my skin.</li>
    <li> I have had facial hair since I was a teenager. After years of waxing and tweezing I got to a point where I gave up on trying to get rid of it and pretended like it was not there, even though everyone could clearly see it.I first saw a product like this on one of those as seen on tv commercials. I was skeptical about it actually working, but when I found this deal on the set of two I figured I&#x27;d tack it on to my order and try it. I got it today and I LOVE IT. Yes, it hurts REALLY bad, but so does every other method of hair removal I&#x27;ve tried. I put ice on my face to numb the area, and then rolled over it with the threader very quickly until all the hair was gone. My mustache was gone in five minutes. There are ZERO hairs left. I had a little bit of trouble on the barely visible type of hair, the peach fuzz on my jaw and chin area, but if you run into trouble just roll it in another direction. It will not work unless you are doing it against the hair growth. If you are thinking about trying it, do it! It is a really cheap reusable tool. Anyone that says it doesn&#x27;t work must not be using it right because it worked on all types of hair for me. I have tiny peach fuzz all the way up to a few very coarse hairs. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> but you can&#x27;t really be too precise. I use it while I sit and read long documents at home in front of the computer and it gets most all of the long hairs on my chinny, chin, chin. Sometimes it, or I, will miss a spot, though. So a mirror and a pair of tweezers come in handy. There is some hair pulling involved. So if you are too squeemish to pluck with tweezers, forget this.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical initially when I watched a video on this product, but once you get the hang of it, it works well.</li>
    <li> these are so great as compared to spending many many minutes with tweezers in front of the mirror. thank you.</li>
    <li> Once you get used to the initial idea of these things, you wonder why did I wait so long. I have saved a small fortune not having to go to the salon to have facial hair removed. Makeup and moisturizer goes on smoothly and I actually feel more confident about the way I look.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get how people actually use these and say it works.. I found hard to use.. hurt.. and not so sure about removing the hair</li>
    <li> I just received this and I love it!!  So far it seems super easy and cleaned my upper lip quickly, not so painlessly but effortlessly.  I&#x27;m curious about how long the implement lasts because that will be the deciding factor.  Although for the price I could buy these frequently and it would still be cheaper than waxing.</li>
    <li> This tool is okay for any hairs over the lip or strays on the face but does not work well on chin hairs or the neck. I use it along with my facial wax.</li>
    <li> I have to say---these things really work!!!  No more mustache and chin whiskers for me!  One caveat--it hurts like hell, but you do get use to it...sorta, kinda.  These little gizmos will no be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for facial hair removal.</li>
    <li> I broke my jaw and since I was in a coma I&#x27;m not sure but they likely shaved the area  since they usually do.  Anyways the older I am getting the more I notice hairs on my lower face, I&#x27;m am lucky that they are a fair color and very fine so I&#x27;m sure nobody notices unless they are really inspecting my face.  But I know it&#x27;s there and I don&#x27;t like it and am happy that I found this product.  It was very easy for me to pick up how to use it, only about 10 minutes at the most.</li>
    <li> great product.  I already spent a lot of time threading so this cut the work in half.  it really works great.</li>
    <li> Mildly painful but easier then plucking</li>
    <li> This hurts more than plucking and it is almost impossible to get it to role an grasp the hairs like it describes</li>
    <li> Does the job great for getting those unwanted facial hairs that seem to creep in as we women grow older.</li>
    <li> I gave these a bad review, but I finally read the instructions and realzied I was using them totally wrong.  Still trying to get the hang of it but now I get!</li>
    <li> Does not work like others I have bought. I ended up putting them in the garbage.</li>
    <li> This works great. You just have to get the hang of it. I opened the packaging and immediately tried it. It does tingle a little bit but nothing worse than waxing your eyebrows (which I don&#x27;t think hurts at all). It doesn&#x27;t make me want to cry like a good waxing does.  I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t seen any bumps or swelling. I like this thing and am hoping over time, with continued use, I won&#x27;t have to do it as much or at all.</li>
    <li> Oh so painfull! I&#x27;d rather pluck or wax. If you could imagine several people each with a tweezer pulling at multiple hairs from several different directions, all at once.</li>
    <li> These are so easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;Several years ago I bought an Emjoi - for $20 - a battery operated tweezer.  It was a waste of $20 for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of Two Threaders is amazing.  They&#x27;re easy and through.  They take out hairs I don&#x27;t even see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You hold the rubber end, bend them in 1/2, put them over (on top of) the hair you want to remove, release and roll up.  Voila! A hairy coil : + }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re slim and don&#x27;t take up much space.  I&#x27;m leaving one at home and taking one with me - just in case.  Have you ever looked in a mirror and seen a hair that sprouted when you weren&#x27;t looking?? One that wasn&#x27;t there when you left in the morning?  It&#x27;s horrifying and kind of funny at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out YouTube if you don&#x27;t understand the instructions but I think they&#x27;re  very clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a little pinch - they remove several hairs at once or one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already told several friends about them.  I&#x27;d Definitely recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product and Great Service</li>
    <li> Heard these are a good tool must be a different brand.  This does nothing maybe one or two hairs at a time. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I really like this threader because it&#x27;s very easy to use.  It does hurt, but you get used to it pretty quick.  I would give it at 70%-80%</li>
    <li> It worked just as it says. It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought and really got my face smooth and baby-fuzz free.</li>
    <li> Took some time to get use to using, but it&#x27;s getting better.</li>
    <li> Love these things. works great for upper and lower lip area. not so much for the rest of my face.</li>
    <li> Go ahead and get two orders of these because you&#x27;ll need more than two. It&#x27;s so addictive after you get the hang of it. I have one for the car now! lol!. Serious, I find myself going to bed at 3am. I really need to pace myself. I&#x27;ve found that you can wash them because body oil gets on the coil and then you get no hair to stick on. I use the blow dryer to dry it so that it doesn&#x27;t rust. Also, the hair collects in the coil and running water has removed it all for me. I use just regular hand foam soap and it&#x27;s done the trick. To use it, you bend the wand/coil in the shape of a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; and twist the wand by rolling it while in the shape of a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34;. I had the hardest time getting this concept down. You&#x27;ll know when you&#x27;re pulling roots vs breaking hairs ... roots is your goal ... so no big movements while you&#x27;re twisting...it will come to you. Ok, places I&#x27;ve used it: Face, it&#x27;s removed 100% of fuzz and a group of eye brows and lashes because I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing. FOCUS around those areas. Put the hair back because it will grab and pull. Sooth the face with a good wash. It took me about an hour on the face but I would imagine maintenance will take less time. Legs, oh yeah, it worked on my legs also. it&#x27;s harder because you have to have an upside down &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s not always easy for both sides of the legs. Needless to say, the inner legs are 100% hair free and the outsides are a work in progress. This is where a partner would be helpful! ;) I&#x27;ve also used it on the vajayjay area and it&#x27;s painful as you can imagine. I need to get that professionally done but I did get the top part.</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly  how advertised. :) Recomend this buyer! I&#x27;m just writing more because I have 5 more words required. Yes.</li>
    <li> The wife can&#x27;t say enough for this product. She had me buy several extras so that she could give them to her friends.</li>
    <li> It worked really well for my upper lip and is easier than messy waxing, but it&#x27;s not effective on thicker chin hairs.  It pulls at them, but doesn&#x27;t have enough grip to pull them all the way out.  Not a replacement for tweezing</li>
    <li> If you have anything beyond baby peach fuzz, this will not work - regardless of how you roll it on your skin. What a joke. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is one great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was planning to pass this by, but I started reading the reviews &amp; thought \\&quot;What the heck!!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I have never had dark upper lip hair ever, until I went thru menopause&lt;br /&gt;&amp; even then it was barely noticeable to anyone but me with a mega magnifying mirror! LOL!&lt;br /&gt;I have never used or had either threading or waxing, but I am no stranger to a tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;Having read the reviews, I had a basic understanding how to use this, so I went right to work.&lt;br /&gt;OMG!  This was great! Just a slight twisting action &amp; those strays were gone!&lt;br /&gt;I just held one side stable &amp; with a slight twist between the fingers of the other hand&lt;br /&gt;over the desired area &amp; that was it!&lt;br /&gt;Now I will say that it did sting for a moment, but only a moment.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare to a tweezer as I have been tweezing my eyebrows since I was a teen&lt;br /&gt;&amp; don&#x27;t remember if it hurt any more, cause it doesn&#x27;t now.&lt;br /&gt;But having used it 3 times now, I thought it stung less.&lt;br /&gt;So I assume with time the skin will toughen up.&lt;br /&gt;Best yet, it did not leave the area all red &amp; puffy like I&#x27;ve seen when others have waxed,&lt;br /&gt;so I think that is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think this is a great product at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;And getting 2 of them is even better!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it very highly!!!</li>
    <li> It take some practice....but it does work. It pulls out the hairs as promised, no mess, no trip to the salon. Also a cool party trick....</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised that this tool works pretty well. It&#x27;s a lot easier, and a lot less stinky, than using removal creams. It doesn&#x27;t always grab everything the first time around, though, and so you have to roll over an area a few times and even then there can be a couple of stubborn hairs that refuse to give up the fight, but that&#x27;s always been the case for me. As many other reviewers have noted, it can hurt like heck in some spots (for me, it&#x27;s my upper lip), but honestly, what stings the most is needing this device in the first place.</li>
    <li> A little hard at first but once you get the hang of it pretty easy and Fast. Does not hurt much either</li>
    <li> It pulls the hair and very painful. I consider this a big waste of money. I&#x27;d ship it back, however I opened one to use and I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t take it back now.... bummer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was a lesson learned, they seam like a good idea, but I can&#x27;t pull the hair I want. Pulls all around it. I went back to tweezers.</li>
    <li> Pros: Pulls hair  from root pick up very short stubble Hair grows back slower and a bit less course  Cons: You need to go over hair SEVERAL times to get rid of it all  Hurts like hell doing upper lip area. I have been using for a couple months now and it still hurts like the first time. Chin area isn&#x27;t as bad once use to it. Takes forever to get an area completely smooth (takes me at least 30 mins get one area)</li>
    <li> This little tool seems cute and easy to take along, but the truth of the matter is it really was ineffective for me. Pulled little hair out and was just weird to use.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful that this product would work the way discribed.  I does not catch all hair. Only a few at a time</li>
    <li> Not thorough, more time consuming than I expected</li>
    <li> I have disease called PCOS which causes me to grown unsightly facial, I have been shaving my face since 16 which has cause lots of skin damage. Tweezing takes to long but is much more effective then shaving so this I figured id try this after trying so many other products and I love all I can say is give it a try its easy to use easy to travel with and virtually painless.</li>
    <li> I just love this little item.  It&#x27;s really easy to use, and I&#x27;m really impressed at how it grabs and removes even really short hairs.  Fine and coarse.  No mirror needed.  I didn&#x27;t expect to be impressed.  Totally surprised me at how well this works.</li>
    <li> OUCH!  I guess the tools do their job. I would rather just go to the threading place next time and pay.</li>
    <li> these items work just as described and much cheaper than the name brands. the smaller one is good for finer hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this product, it really does work! It definitely is not pain-free, but it feels similar to waxing or tweezing.</li>
    <li> The epicare product was very good, but it was a little damaged so i was kind of dissappointed. On the bright side, it works very good and it is a cheap way to take out your facial hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I first used this product, it worked.  Over time, the product ceases to remove hair.  You get two threading tools.  I used both, but they stopped working.  I&#x27;ve gone back to the product to see if my technique was wrong, but they still stopped working.  You get what you pay for.  It might work for someone else, but it has not worked for me.</li>
    <li> this tool hurts on some areas on my face, But it does works</li>
    <li> it works okay, not the best method to remove hair but it works, it&#x27;s the quickest and easiest way. Very convenient to carry arround</li>
    <li> I discovered this type of facial hair removal system about a month ago.  I got it as a preliminary treatment before using my permanent hair removal system that involves flashes of light and was very expensive. The instructions were to remove hair before the permanent treatment.  I could have gone for threading, but decided to try this first.  This &amp;#34;threading tool&amp;#34; is not a painless procedure, and it is not as thorough as professional threading.  But I found that to be an advantage. I&#x27;ve decided a little bit of fine facial hair adds to a softer, more natural look. I don&#x27;t want to have a shiny smooth face like a fish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using my permanent hair removal system a few times, I decided it is fantastic for all areas EXCEPT my face.  The harsh light aged and dried my face noticeably and it didn&#x27;t stop hair growth as it has on legs, underarms, and bikini area.  My routine will be to use this tweezing tool a couple of times a month and forget the permanent hair removal system for my face. I&#x27;m thinking that although it does indeed hurt, it is over very quickly, doesn&#x27;t require a trip to a shop,  stimulates blood flow, is very inexpensive, and the results are just right.  So far, no yukky black hairs that sometimes show up around my lips have grown back. I&#x27;m pretty excited about this tool.  It&#x27;s a convenient and inexpensive way to deal with facial hair.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is it hurts so much I can&#x27;t get far enough to see if it really works...OUCH</li>
    <li> This is a little time consuming and there is a little bit of a learning curve, but ultimately these do work.</li>
    <li> Even after getting the knack of using it takes me too long to use.  Besides which, pulling the peach fuzz hurts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I tried it several time but it does not work for me. Maybe its my technique but if the idea is to take less time this fails.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face.  That&#x27;s the only place I can control it well.  But I love this little tool and can&#x27;t imagine living so long without it.  Not easy on the eyebrows, but given the price and how well it works, I&#x27;d recommend it.  It does &amp;#34;prickle&amp;#34; when you just start using it or haven&#x27;t for a few days in a row, but if you&#x27;ve had any waxing done, this is nothing in comparison.  And no big, red marks left behind.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!!! It definitely hurts on the tender parts of my face but it removes my chin hairs so well.</li>
    <li> these works great. but like pulling out any hair. ouch!!</li>
    <li> this is a pathetic product... no matter how slowly I rolled it, it basically borke the hair near the root instead of pulling the whole thing out... also, its very hard to control precisely which hair you pull out... one of the plaxtic handles broke recently so i cannot even use it any more... thank god for that though coa i got a tweezer instead and that works much better than this..</li>
    <li> I really like this.  It&#x27;s a little painful, but if your used to tweezing, threading or waxing, it won&#x27;t be unbearable.  I like it that I get two for the price and it&#x27;s mobile.  I use the tool while watching tv, and it works.</li>
    <li> First off, I don&#x27;t know if this product just isn&#x27;t right for me alone, or if it&#x27;s just not right for people with similar hair types. I have a lot of hair in general, it&#x27;s all fine as well, on my head I have like Chinchilla hair going on (thick in volume and fine in type), on my body most of it is peach fuzz, but theres some peach fuzz that I would like to make disappear, mainly on the face. And this product unfortunately doesn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;While it does remove some hairs successfully, it does leave many hairs behind, and even when I re-roll over the area, it can&#x27;t pick up any of those same hairs. I tried rolling different directions, cleaning out the product, stretching the skin, and still it can&#x27;t do ALL the hair. It&#x27;s a bit of a shame and I would rather stick to waxing, as difficult as that is for me to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;I am the only person I know who bought and tried this product, and I can tell you that it&#x27;s not like threading, and it&#x27;s also not like waxing either. I didn&#x27;t experience any severe pain from it, it was pretty normal par for the course type hair pulling &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; you&#x27;d get from plucking/waxing/threading.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the product will work better on you, or other people, but just generally didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> I loved it did the job I was Happy thank you.</li>
    <li> Cheap alternative to going to the salon. I&#x27;ve been using one for a few months and it works great. The only thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t grab the thick, coarse hairs, but rather the smaller, finer hair. But that&#x27;s ok with me, because the big, black coarse ones are easiest to grab with a pair of tweezers anyway. It does hurt, but if you&#x27;re used to waxing a threading it&#x27;s just like that.</li>
    <li> It certainly pulls the hair out. So, on the plus side it&#x27;s effective. On the negative, it is excruciating. I found it&#x27;s less painful to go fast but then it&#x27;s hard to get the hair. Plus it&#x27;s just kinda awkward so it&#x27;s not easy to get around the cheeks and chin.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than trying to pluck with tweezers all the time!</li>
    <li> Works! But it&#x27;s painful.</li>
    <li> Good for finer hairs but if hair is thick it does not work that well.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase find it easy to use.  I will no longer need to use tweezers for removing facial hair around the lips and chin area and will not miss the &amp;#34;stubble feel&amp;#34;: after the tweezers.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is ok but I&#x27;ve bought other spring hair removers that worked better. The springs don&#x27;t seem to be close enough.</li>
    <li> The effect of this is similar to threading.  Read the instructions as it is not comment sense to figure out how to use.</li>
    <li> Hurts quite a bit...I guess I&#x27;m hairier than I thought! You have to really get the hang of it before it will work. So, bend into a &amp;#34;u&amp;#34; shape, then turn both handles inwards at the same time---against the direction of hair growth. Painful, but I expected pulling out multiple hairs at once would be. It worked better on the upper lip than on my chin. Good price for a pair...</li>
    <li> Great easy way to remove facial hair. I like it because it gets several at once. I&#x27;ve had the same spring for about a year now and have not needed to replace. I use it every month I would say, not that often, but it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I really like these.</li>
    <li> Although cheap, these were a waste of money. Directions were not clear and stuff written in a foreign language didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
    <li> This tool really works. It does take time to get used to using, but once that is accomplished the hair is gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these awesome little threaders for years. They really do work you just have to get the hang of how to either bend and twist or pull it straight out and then close it to get the hair. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews people saying it doesn&#x27;t work but honestly all you have to do is YouTube it to see how to do it. It&#x27;s easy! I&#x27;ve had this product from this seller for 6 months now and it&#x27;s still fine. Takes me about 2min to do my eyebrows and then I use it to get those baby fine hairs along my chin. Definitely worth buying this if you just take the time to learn how to use it.</li>
    <li> I have on in my purse and one in my makeup cart. Fast and easy. You never get use to the feeling of the hair being removed but that&#x27;s the price you pay.</li>
    <li> It hurts like HECK at first but then after you get the hang of things, it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I removed hair on my face that I didnt even know I had!&lt;br /&gt;Even my co-workers noticed how clear my face looked minutes after using.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this. Way better than lotions that may leave redness after use.&lt;br /&gt;SOLD!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from chemical hair removals to waxing to tweezing and threading. This product is great and doesn&#x27;t cost much. Yes it will hurt around the upper lip and it will take some getting used to if you&#x27;ve never used the above hair removal methods. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it rusting, but I haven&#x27;t washed it in water. The hairs can be pulled out or I use a tissue to remove them from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note, when you pull hair out from the root you are leaving an open pore on your face. If you aren&#x27;t careful that pore will fill with acne just like any other normal pore on your face. Make sure you continue using your cleanser and exfoliator to prevent break outs. The pores will be healed after a day or two. Best wishes to future customers. I love this product.</li>
    <li> hated these they hurt to much and cut the hair instead of pulling it out.</li>
    <li> My SIL has one that she got from QVC and I bought these as they were more budget friendly, let me first say that I have POS so &amp;#34;man hair&amp;#34; on my upper lip and chin are a constant problem. I keep the threader in my bag and am able to take care of unwanted facial hair anytime, and it is a lot easier to use than the epilady I was using on my face and it does not rip my skin off. Love it!</li>
    <li> I thought these would be very easy to use and convenient but they didn&#x27;t even work as well as I thought they would. At times it feels like they&#x27;re not doing anything at all. Extremely painful, but that part I expected.</li>
    <li> This tool is a must!  I use it for the sides of my face, cheeks, forehead - basically everywhere I have hair except my brows!  But here&#x27;s the thing, if you&#x27;ve never waxed before, then you don&#x27;t know the feeling.  But yes, this tool will sting.  The more you use it, the less painful it becomes.  I&#x27;ve bought another brand of facial hair remover before that was five stars, but bought this one because it came as a 2-pack.  It&#x27;s important that you don&#x27;t forget to clean this though.  If you&#x27;re a bit of germophobe like me, then you keep a bottle of alcohol handy to sanitize your beauty tools.  The only reason I gave this four stars is the handle.  I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s not smooth but has small bumps on it.  If you use it for a length of time, the texture of the handle makes my fingers sore from twirling it around and around.</li>
    <li> Works well.Does the job.</li>
    <li> Like plucking eyebrows, I was looking for something to pluck the stray chin and underneath nasal,hair. I never would have believed that this threading tool would work, but it does! Unlike others I did not find this really painful. Childbirth, now that is painful. Roll the threading tool between two fingers of each hand over the area you want the hair to be gone. You will feel a slight pull, under the nose is a more sensitive area, so it may bring a tear, but once you keep this up, it is not painful. You can remove the unwanted hair in your home, by yourself. One of the most important aspects is to clean the threading tools in-between hair removal with rubbing alcohol and to legit air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of these facial hair removers is based on threading-style hair removal, though its precision spring-action system doesn&#x27;t actually use thread. With a simple bend-and-roll motion, it removes hair at the root--quickly and effectively and without damaging your skin. Great for touch-ups and perfect for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-24-13</li>
    <li> I just received this product yesterday and I am addicted to it.  It does hurt the first time you use it, but others say that the pain is not as bad if you use it about once a week.  I normally just tweeze my facial hair, because I don&#x27;t have a lot of issues, but this is fast and easy.  I like waxing too, but I don&#x27;t always have the time to go in and do that.  There are YouTube videos to show you how to use the product.</li>
    <li> This definitely works well and it feels just like it does when you get a professional threading job done.  It stings in little zaps as it pulls hair from the face.  But it does pull out the hair.</li>
    <li> Does not work.  I have tried to do everything to get these things to work.  Really wish they did work, but they don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered these and loves them. She says they do a great job as they were described. She has told several friends about them and how good they do.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. The company is also great and they shipped the product before the expected time. I will recommend this for future purchases.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s super painful lol but really worth it.  I didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of facial hair to begin with, but way way less now.  After only two uses or so, I only use &amp;#34;the torture device&amp;#34; maybe every other month.  Works great.</li>
    <li> For me, the wax strips work much better.</li>
    <li> This does not work at all!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this little tool. I have rather thick side burns ( I&#x27;m Greek). I&#x27;ve waxed and tried other hair removal methods, this is by far the best one yet. It does hurt a little, after a few uses you get use to it. I love love love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these before (and paid a lot less) that were more effective.  Seems like the coil isn&#x27;t as tight and doesn&#x27;t grasp the hair as quickly.  It is adequate but not the best.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have tried every possible method of hair removal possible, this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, leave me with ingrown hairs, and has a long lasting effect. It&#x27;s moderately painful, but that comes with the territory, and your nerve endings go dead after a while anyway. I bought several 2 packs and gifted the extras to friends.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have written, these may take a bit of practice to learn how to pull the hair out instead of just breaking it off, but they can do the job.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re easy to use and it is somewhat painful at first, but I don&#x27;t like it, because the tool is really good at getting fine, transparent peach fuzz and is horrible at getting long, dark, coarse patches.  I re-gifted to my sister who I doubt will use it.</li>
    <li> works well. It took some practice to figure it out. It hurt the first few times , but not so much anymore.</li>
    <li> I had used similar hair remover types with satisfaction but these don&#x27;t quite do the job.  Oh well they didn&#x27;t cost that much</li>
