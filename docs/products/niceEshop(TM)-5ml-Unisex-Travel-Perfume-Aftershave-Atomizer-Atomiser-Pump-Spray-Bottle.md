      <li>These worked great for about 5 uses, but then the atomizer got stuck and wouldn&#x27;t spray anymore.  </li>
      <li>The price is great, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>For the price, these are great.  </li>
      <li>Great value.  </li>

      <li>Good value at a good price.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s good to have in ur purse.</li>
      <li>Comes in handy when on the go.</li>
      <li>These put out a really nice spray.  </li>
      <li>Love the color and how it fits so nicely into any size of purse.</li>
      <li>Atomizer makes a very fine mist.  </li>
      <li>The bubble envelope needs to offer better protection, because they are dented in transit.</li>
      <li>They work better for Poo-Pourr than the travel size bottles that say &amp;#34;Poo-Pourri&amp;#34; on them.  </li>
      <li>Granted, you still will wait about 2 weeks or more for these to arrive-</li>
      <li>Better off paying more for a better refillable spray.</li>
      <li>I mixed two colognes which I like to use and it works flawlessly</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Nice size and quick arrival.</li>
      <li>I filled it with rose water to use a light perfume and refresher during the day.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this item and love that I can refill it at any point.</li>
      <li>The spray is strong, even better than the original</li>
      <li>They are easy to fill and use.</li>
      <li>I use one for eyeglass cleaner and it is easy to fill and the bottom slides off</li>
      <li>Easy to fill but does leak a bit while traveling in checked luggage.  </li>
      <li>Easy to fill...just pour inside after unscrewing sprayer.  </li>
      <li>STRONGLY RECOMMEND NO ONE BUYS THIS ITEM</li>
      <li>I like to keep it in my purse for those moments when you have to go in public, and it works great.</li>
      <li>I have filled them with my colognes and can carry one in my pocket for use anytime.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t leak which is important.  </li>
      <li>I get nervous that they&#x27;ll leak, but so far, so good.</li>
      <li>Excellent little atomizer!  </li>
      <li>so you can see how full it is.  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing</li>
      <li>Which might be great if you need something heavy; I used it for water and rosemary and peppermint oil mix as a &amp;#34;smell good&amp;#34; and it works well, but I have to refill often.</li>
      <li>Other travel portable sprayers are larger, this is the smallest made anywhere, that&#x27;s what makes it the best.  </li>
      <li>Spraying is good in one, acceptable in the other.  </li>
      <li>but the caps come right off.</li>
      <li>Worked great the first few times I used it</li>
      <li>These little atomizers fit nicely in my purse and spray very well.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately this two-pack wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
      <li>When I try to open it, the bottom comes off instead of the top and the stuff I put into it</li>
      <li>so you are able to use smaller items for after shaves, perfumes and colognes.</li>
      <li>So it works well, and was easy enough to open and fill, but the pump action on this was too good</li>
      <li>Nice little purse size spray bottles at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected :-)</li>
      <li>Where many spray bottles would create a nice wide cloud of mist, these bottles spray a pretty narrow cone.</li>
      <li>Nice little stocking stuffers.</li>
      <li>Good product, although some of the bottles were hard to get apart to refill.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Inner compartment is made of glass, outer metal shell protects your product from light</li>
      <li>Still paid full proces, still only got one of these.  </li>
      <li>I guess since this item ships from China, it took much longer than it should have normally.  </li>
      <li>bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build is good, and hopefully they will last for a little while.</li>
      <li>so you can use these as convenient on-the-go travel size containers for even your high dollar fragrances.</li>
      <li>I love these little travel perfume atomizer.</li>
      <li>I filled one with water, the other with cologne.</li>
      <li>Can carry small amount of hair spray or your favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>Amazing buy if you&#x27;re patient on shipping and don&#x27;t mind a few minor imperfections.</li>
      <li>When I arrived to my destination, the perfume completely spiilled out of one.</li>
      <li>So far, no leaking.</li>
      <li>and I have yet to come across this kind of sprayer in retail ready condition for less that $2.50 EACH- and even that price assumes you want at least 100 and can wait for shipping from China.</li>
      <li>Not for long trips though as it doesn&#x27;t store too much liquid.</li>
      <li>For the price that I have paid, I don&#x27;t really mind a dent or two, as long as they work.</li>
      <li>Of the 4 I received, every single one of them had some kind of small dent, scratches, or other noticeable imperfection.</li>
      <li>I run a small business selling handcrafted natural skin care and fragrance items and have searched high and low for wholesale packaging supplies available in very small quantities (think dozens rather than 100&#x27;s or 1,000&#x27;s-still considered &amp;#34;small&amp;#34;,</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve taken it apart and cleaned it and the same thing has happened with the other (I bought a set of two).</li>

<li> This is a terrible product  it is poorly engineered and broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
<li> When the pump is pressed, the casing gets in the way just enough that it prevents the liquid from fully &#x27;spraying&#x27; and instead sort of spray/globs out and a lot of the liquid gets on and in the base of the spray pump.</li>
<li> I returned this because it arrived dirty.</li>
<li> I was disappointed I could not use the travel pump bottles.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought two and sprayed perfume into each and placed them in my travel bag. When I arrived to my destination, the perfume completely spiilled out of one. The other still has the perfume.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel.  I use for cologne.  Not for long trips though as it doesn&#x27;t store too much liquid.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 of these and it is the same with all of them. When the pump is pressed, the casing gets in the way just enough that it prevents the liquid from fully &#x27;spraying&#x27; and instead sort of spray/globs out and a lot of the liquid gets on and in the base of the spray pump. Wastes whatever liquid you put in it.</li>
    <li> if you want this any time soon buy else where</li>
    <li> Awesome spray bottle, and so cute.</li>
    <li> I filled it with rose water to use a light perfume and refresher during the day. The size is perfect and fits well in my purse. The spritzer function works perfectly. I really enjoy this item and love that I can refill it at any point.</li>
    <li> Good product, although some of the bottles were hard to get apart to refill.</li>
    <li> These worked great for about 5 uses, but then the atomizer got stuck and wouldn&#x27;t spray anymore.  I tried washing it out to see if my perfume somehow clogged it, but no to avail.  The second one had the same problem after only a handful of uses.  The price is great, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Worked great the first few times I used it but now it just leaks through the pump area.  I&#x27;ve taken it apart and cleaned it and the same thing has happened with the other (I bought a set of two).</li>
    <li> Easy to fill but does leak a bit while traveling in checked luggage.  I put it in a ziploc bag.</li>
    <li> I ordered this atomizer to use with my Poo Pourri and it works great. I like to keep it in my purse for those moments when you have to go in public, and it works great.</li>
    <li> Based on the product I received, if you plan on using these sprayers as packaging for a retail product, DO NOT BUY THESE! Of the 4 I received, every single one of them had some kind of small dent, scratches, or other noticeable imperfection. For personal use, however, the value for money simply can&#x27;t be beat! I run a small business selling handcrafted natural skin care and fragrance items and have searched high and low for wholesale packaging supplies available in very small quantities (think dozens rather than 100&#x27;s or 1,000&#x27;s-still considered &amp;#34;small&amp;#34;, btw) and I have yet to come across this kind of sprayer in retail ready condition for less that $2.50 EACH- and even that price assumes you want at least 100 and can wait for shipping from China. Granted, you still will wait about 2 weeks or more for these to arrive- you guessed it, from China - but for the cost, who cares? Inner compartment is made of glass, outer metal shell protects your product from light so you can use these as convenient on-the-go travel size containers for even your high dollar fragrances. Amazing buy if you&#x27;re patient on shipping and don&#x27;t mind a few minor imperfections.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Nice little stocking stuffers. Can carry small amount of hair spray or your favorite perfume. So far, no leaking.</li>
    <li> These put out a really nice spray.  The cap doesn&#x27;t always stay on so would watch keeping them in your pocket or purse. I Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice size and quick arrival.</li>
    <li> These little atomizers fit nicely in my purse and spray very well.  I use one for eyeglass cleaner and it is easy to fill and the bottom slides off so you can see how full it is.  Wish I&#x27;d found this sooner.</li>
    <li> This does the job for me.  I mixed two colognes which I like to use and it works flawlessly and i can carry it with me..  very nice.</li>
    <li> Excellent little atomizer!  Love the color and how it fits so nicely into any size of purse.</li>
    <li> I love these little travel perfume atomizer. Comes in handy when on the go. Would def repurchase again. :) thanks</li>
    <li> I had some perfume came in bottle without atomizer, which was not convenient.  This atomizer looks very nice and does the job.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I like this but ordered a two pack and only got one.  I tried to resolve with seller and got a run around.  Still paid full proces, still only got one of these.  But I do use the one I did get regularly.</li>
    <li> So it works well, and was easy enough to open and fill, but the pump action on this was too good: you can spray out the contents in just a few dozen sprays. Which might be great if you need something heavy; I used it for water and rosemary and peppermint oil mix as a &amp;#34;smell good&amp;#34; and it works well, but I have to refill often.</li>
    <li> When I try to open it, the bottom comes off instead of the top and the stuff I put into it goes all over my hands.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill...just pour inside after unscrewing sprayer.  Atomizer makes a very fine mist.  Perfect andd  doesn&#x27;t leak which is important.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I tried out a couple different of these small spray bottles recently. Unfortunately this two-pack wasn&#x27;t the best. Where many spray bottles would create a nice wide cloud of mist, these bottles spray a pretty narrow cone. You only get 1-2 dozen pumps out of it but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, you know what you&#x27;re getting with these very small 5ml bottles. Finally, the glass came cracked on the reservoir of one of the bottles, not going to bother dealing with that for this price especially since the seller is out of country and shipping took a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Other travel portable sprayers are larger, this is the smallest made anywhere, that&#x27;s what makes it the best.  I filled one with water, the other with cologne.</li>
    <li> They are easy to fill and use. I have filled them with my colognes and can carry one in my pocket for use anytime.</li>
    <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s not of particularly high quality. Spraying became difficult after only a few uses and instead of spraying the liquid merely seeped out. Perhaps it was the product I was using (Poopourri) but it&#x27;s hard to tell. I ended up just chucking it.</li>
    <li> I need this for my perfume . and it&#x27;s good to have in ur purse. People think it&#x27;s lip. When u know it&#x27;s perfume.</li>
    <li> Nice product, attractive.  The atomizer for one of the two I purchased stopped working.  Can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
    <li> Better off paying more for a better refillable spray.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Great product. I use it for hand made hand sanitation and gave it to my kids to take it to school.</li>
    <li> I returned this because it arrived dirty. It was in a plastic bag but it was greasy, grimy, and scratched.</li>
    <li> Ordered two.  One arrived with dents in it.  It was difficult to open.  Based is screwed into misting part.  Not sure about evaporation and other longer term use.  Will follow up later.</li>
    <li> I guess since this item ships from China, it took much longer than it should have normally.  Size is actually bigger than I thought it would be, so that makes up for a little of the inconvienience in having to wait.</li>
    <li> Got this on the other day, and the only thing I can say is, they work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little dented when it arrived in the mail from China. The bubble envelope needs to offer better protection, because they are dented in transit. For the price that I have paid, I don&#x27;t really mind a dent or two, as long as they work. The spray is strong, even better than the original bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build is good, and hopefully they will last for a little while.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product  it is poorly engineered and broke the first time I tried to use it. STRONGLY RECOMMEND NO ONE BUYS THIS ITEM</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected :-)</li>
    <li> For the price, these are great.  Spraying is good in one, acceptable in the other.  I get nervous that they&#x27;ll leak, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised.  Does not leak and the receipt of the items was quicker than forecasted.  Great items for travel so you are able to use smaller items for after shaves, perfumes and colognes.</li>
    <li> Nice little purse size spray bottles at a very reasonable price.  They work better for Poo-Pourr than the travel size bottles that say &amp;#34;Poo-Pourri&amp;#34; on them.  I&#x27;d rather the purse version look like a perfume spray, personally..  If you haven&#x27;t met &amp;#34;Poo-Pourri&amp;#34; yet, that&#x27;s something to check out!</li>
    <li> it comes with two of these things. I thought I would like them but the caps come right off. So what&#x27;s the point of having it if you can&#x27;t cap it.</li>
    <li> Good value at a good price.</li>
    <li> Maybe I misunderstood the product description, but I thought I could load the travel pump FROM my atomizer spray bottle of cologne??  But this product requires liquid cologne in a bottle, transferred via a funnel.  I was disappointed I could not use the travel pump bottles.</li>
    <li> Awesome buy, good quality! Came on time.</li>
