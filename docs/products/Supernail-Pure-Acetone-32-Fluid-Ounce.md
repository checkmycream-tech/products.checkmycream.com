<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my friend for easier removal of glitter nail polish.  Just as told, it works great.  I have enough to last quite a long time with the 32 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> I love these products. I can not wait to order again. I love it. If you are looking for the best you found it.</li>
    <li> great value good product</li>
    <li> Only product that would remove spa facial wax spilled all over a floor, cabinet, walls and bathroom counter (Courian)!  Great stuff.....</li>
    <li> Why pay 10 dollars to have your acrylics soaked off when you can do it yourself and have enough product left over to remove polish for years to comes/</li>
    <li> the cap on the bottle was loose during shipment and about 1/2 of the contents drained out. the supplier would not work with me on a replacement. I would not recommend this comapany</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, fantastic product. Great quality for a &#x27;super&#x27; price. I would buy this from SuperNail again, and recommend anyone else to do the same.</li>
    <li> The product I received does not match the description or the picture of the Amazon listing. It is not pure acetone. There are at least 4 other chemicals mixed with it.</li>
    <li> as describe , good product for my gel remover</li>
    <li> remove the polish great.</li>
    <li> I used this to remove the ink on PVC projects I build and it works great, so should work for removing fingernail polish too. ;)</li>
    <li> Bottle was only half full on arrival. Bottle was closed and inside of bag so not sure if it leaked out.</li>
    <li> Love this polish remover. It dries quickly on the cotton before really soaking into the polish that&#x27;s the only con. What more can I say? It does the job. Just as with any other varnish remover, expect it to dry quickly.</li>
    <li> This product will get rid of your nail polish in seconds. Forget about other ones that you need to keep on rubbing to get the color off. Not this product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> the product came home with a broken lid and as stated in the complaint, was to carry peru, and not be able this inconvenience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s acetone, it works. But learned my lesson about buying it online. I have since found 32 ounce bottles of acetone for much less in Sally beauty.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of taking off my polish. I have real nails and am careful not to damage them the only thing is the product arrived about 6-8 ounces short. It is a large bottle but the care taken to insure it doesn&#x27;t leak perhaps in shipment is lacking.  I put it in my polish box and though I thought the lid was tight it still leaked. I may not use this provider again.</li>
    <li> This product takes the gel nail polish off easier than any other I have used, about 15 minutes. Plus the odor is not as strong as other products.  It arrived on time and I feel the price is right.</li>
    <li> It removes nail polish really fast and easy</li>
    <li> very useful when removing artificial nails.</li>
    <li> Really excellent nail polish remover.  Even got of the stubborn glitter nail polish well.  Thanks!  I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This product works great - no more struggling to get my nail polish off.</li>
    <li> Does just what you want acetone to do. Removes polish, gel, etc. quickly and easily.  Good price and great speed of delivery with Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order again when I finish this bottle,</li>
    <li> It was a big ol&#x27; bottle of 100% acetone.  I have been using it to take off my gel nail polish and it works wonderfully.  Using acetone on your hands will dry them out big time though so make sure to use lots of lotion when you are done if you are using it for taking off gel nails/polish.</li>
    <li> basically pure acetone, it works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> The bottle leaked a little from delivery, but it&#x27;s ro be expected.</li>
    <li> I actually got this for my skateboard bearing cleaning kit, but I&#x27;ve seen this used in Nail Salons too. I guess it has a ton of uses. I did notice however that my lid was leaking. If I put the bottle on it&#x27;s side some acetone would leak out. I guess just keep the bottle standing up and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> I no longer have to spend an hour to remove all my polish, top and base coats.  This stuff takes me only about 10 minutes for all 10 fingers.  Keeps me from getting cramps in my hands just to remove the polish.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bottle was insecure - acetone ate through the glue that bound the seal to the cap.  Box came soaked in acetone (poor UPS guy!) which is a pretty big safety issue (at least).  I&#x27;m likely already losing acetone to evaporation (beyond the acetone lost to direct leakage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0006PS3KI B0006PS3KI]] is another bottle I bought (same store sells it) that seemed a great deal more secure than this one.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> The packaging was fine with the one I received. I am reediting this because some do not understand safety precautions. My 1st review was that I gave it to a young woman. She does pretty designs etc. BE CAREFUL!</li>
    <li> Always does a great job!</li>
    <li> Purchased this time as a gift, this is the best acetone nail polish remover I&#x27;ve found hands down. It&#x27;s also a great price and you get a ton! Soaks off gel manicures pretty quickly, melts the glue on nails in no time flat and just does a really great job of taking off any nail color; even glitters have met they&#x27;re match! This is pure acetone so make sure to wash hands/nails after use and condition nails well with cuticle oil afterwards to avoid drying out your nails too much.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I would expect from 32oz of acetone. I use it along with 0000 steel wool to remove water spots from our granite counter tops. this is recommended for blue pearl granite.</li>
    <li> Live it!!! Works great, polishing very quickly removed</li>
    <li> Takes off my nail polish very fast.  Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Size is nice but the bottle bottom is totally bowed, so I can&#x27;t actually stand it up straight when in use. It has to be propped between other things.</li>
    <li> Takes your nail polish off in a flash! Excellent Wonderful Product!! I have been using this brand for about a year. They are reasonably priced and the time you save using this is absolutely worth EVERY penny!!!  Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Being a professional, it&#x27;s an excellent product that I recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
    <li> This works just as it should, it gets the acrylic, and the nails polish off my nails with ease. You don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of it in a short time either!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s acetone, it&#x27;s cheap. No worries here.</li>
    <li> Purchased to use as a bearing cleaner. Works great</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only kind I buy - takes the polish off with little effort!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Works great as always!</li>
    <li> Great and Fast Delivery</li>
