### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>One of the best beauty secrets I&#x27;ve encountered and I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this all these years!!</li>
      <li>Very good for swimming.</li>
      <li>very good product.  </li>
      <li>AMAZING!</li>
      <li>This is a fair product.</li>
      <li>I swim laps in a saltwater/chlorine pool and even though I was using the absolute best waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve ever found, I&#x27;d still end up with raccoon eyes after exiting the pool...</li>
      <li>Was very easy to use.</li>
      <li>As the box says, it&#x27;s probably more effective with fair-haired women.</li>
      <li>It dyed my fingers more than my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve probably tried over 40 different brands of mascara in my lifetime and the best waterproof one I&#x27;ve found is &amp;#34;Bad Girl Lash&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>It goes on better with a mascara brush.</li>
      <li>Bought the brown eyebrow and thought it was okay.</li>
      <li>The wife love it...</li>
      <li>Too easy.</li>
      <li>Well the product was easy to use.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years, it lasts just as it says and it is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a replacement for mascara but good for those of us who have blonde or very light eyelashes and don&#x27;t want to appear as if we have no lashes when our mascara comes off.</li>
      <li>It worked fantasticly...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to know that although this darkens the lashes, it doesn&#x27;t make them thicker, so if you have puny lashes, you may still want to &amp;#34;plump them</li>
      <li>Then it is super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Time to try a different and hopefully more effective product.</li>
      <li>I love my results and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I love the eyebrow tint this same company makes and I have very light colored lashes.</li>
      <li>I had q-tips on hand for quick mistake clean-ups and removed the product at the end with Ponds face wipes.</li>
      <li>This product was super easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t burn nearly as much as some people claim.</li>
      <li>It did not last more than  a day!  </li>
      <li>For the money (under $20), it was worth the try</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>use same kind my salon.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Instead, I found using cheapy Sally&#x27;s semi-permanent hair dye to be far better.</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;ve applied mascara for more than 30 years perfectly, for some crazy reason I was getting this all over the place (thank goodness for Q-tips).  </li>
      <li>Used the product in \\&quot;black\\&quot; several times over the course of time...not very happy with results considering all the mess &amp; time.</li>
      <li>For sure it does NOT last for 28 days....</li>
      <li>First off, they recommend using petroleum jelly to adhere the &amp;#34;eye shields&amp;#34; to your under eyes.</li>
      <li>Plan to search for another product in attempt to find something that darkens lashes better, quicker &amp; without several applications.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly, even did the 24 hour skin test.  </li>
      <li>I tinted both sides of my upper lashes and just the top side of my bottoms.  </li>
      <li>the dye only lasted a couple of weeks at most.</li>
      <li>Firstly, quickest shipping ever.</li>
      <li>glad I only got a one time application!</li>
      <li>Not only do the eye shields NOT stick, you are introducing an oily substance when the directions clearly state to keep eye area free of oil and to use an oil free makeup remover before applying.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work at all for me, absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>but it was really bothersome to my eyes.</li>
      <li>I was really bummed.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t really work for me - although I did notice it on my lower lashes.</li>
      <li>I would much rather have to deal with a dye working too well than not at all.</li>
      <li>Good product, fast and last for several weeks as noted, it also looks natural.  </li>
      <li>I liked not having to put on regular mascara to get outside.</li>
      <li>I finally swapped the &amp;#34;single lash applicator&amp;#34; for a clean mascara wand I had.</li>
      <li>but I imagine it&#x27;s probably like hair color, less washing the better</li>
      <li>so I plan to not use my facial cleanser on my brows and will be safe with other products.</li>
      <li>WOW what a difference it makes.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this product</li>
      <li>Still get it done professionally at a salon.</li>
      <li>I get my eyebrows professionally tinted.</li>
      <li>I applied it twice (2 x within 1 hour) in an attempt to stain my eyelashes, which are light at the tips/ends...glopped it on because I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t getting enough of it on my lashes...very messy &amp; didn&#x27;t darken them much at all and smears even after cleaning it off.</li>
      <li>The color wasn&#x27;t strong enough, a bit messy to use.</li>
      <li>A great emergency back up if you hate mascara and can&#x27;t get to a professional, but it is not a real solution to darken light lashes.</li>
      <li>To my horror, I&#x27;ve developed some that are completely white.</li>
      <li>I soap up my entire face twice a day and the color has only faded a little from the very tips of my lashes, so I&#x27;d recommend this to those with a steady hand.</li>
      <li>Incidentally, there is a tiny splatter on my lower cheek that I never saw and it hasn&#x27;t faded for two weeks, so clean up spills immediately and don&#x27;t even try this if you have a shaky hand.</li>

<li> Godefroy 28 Day MASCARA Permanent Eyelash/Eyebrow Tint, in Black:</li>
<li> This product gave me black eyelashes as advertised.</li>
<li> I use Adore, black velvet.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little awkward to put on the first time, but once you get the hang of it</li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t even get the product out of the little packets.  </li>
<li> It was a waste of  money.  </li>
<li> WASTE OF MONEY.  </li>
<li> But my lashes were noticeably darker and that lasted for a few weeks for me.</li>
<li> That did fade after a day or so but looked a bit green as it faded.</li>
<li> Dried.</li>
<li> and using a small lash or brow brush to apply the gel and activator.</li>
<li> Very uncomfortable near my eye.  </li>
<li> This works well although hard to apply with the tools that come with it.  </li>
<li> was also hard to not get in on you skin.</li>
<li> It was a little tedious and difficult to get all lashes, especially with the applicator provided.</li>
<li> I recommend Aquaphor or vaseline around the eye area (but not touching the lashes!)</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very difficult to apply because you have two different solutions to attempt to get on your eyelashes without staining your skin</li>
<li> this not a good product dont biy it</li>
<li> Dried up in packets - useless.  </li>
<li> I did not find the product to be that irritating to my eyes, but it was difficult to apply and remove and did not even produce the desired dark lash results.</li>
<li> It was virtually impossible for me to hole this pink &amp;#34;paddle&amp;#34; under my eyelashes and paint on the mascara without getting it on the skin.  </li>
<li> my eyelashes are thin</li>
<li> and I thought I was going to blind myself before I finished,</li>
<li> It&#x27;s extremely difficult to use</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have white eyelashes and this product did tint them. Very good for swimming. My eyelashes stayed dark even after swimming. I liked not having to put on regular mascara to get outside.</li>
    <li> A great emergency back up if you hate mascara and can&#x27;t get to a professional, but it is not a real solution to darken light lashes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, it lasts just as it says and it is easy to use.  Will order again when needed</li>
    <li> I used to dye my eyelashes when I was much younger. It came in different packaging and was very simple to use. This product is nothing like what I used to use and I thought I was going to blind myself before I finished, which I didn&#x27;t- finish that is. It&#x27;s extremely difficult to use and I ended up giving up and washing it off before it had a chance to do anything except get in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Bought the black permanent eyelash and hated it. Bought the brown eyebrow and thought it was okay. The eyelash dye does not work at all. I was really bummed. The eyebrow tint works too well. Dyed everything, including my skin. That did fade after a day or so but looked a bit green as it faded. I would much rather have to deal with a dye working too well than not at all. I cannot believe the eyelash tint did nothing.</li>
    <li> Dried up in packets - useless.  Couldn&#x27;t even get the product out of the little packets.  So disappointed. Dried. Up.</li>
    <li> This works well although hard to apply with the tools that come with it.  Buy the disposable eyelash brush to help with the application.  Then it is super easy to apply.</li>
    <li> IMPOSSIBLE TO USE! WASTE OF MONEY.  PRODUCT NOT AS DESCRIBED.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANY ONE!  PLEASE PASS THIS INFO ON TO OTHERS THAT MAY BE TEMPTED TO BUY.</li>
    <li> It goes on better with a mascara brush. It did have a burning to it. It did not last 28 days.</li>
    <li> This product did not work.  I applied it three times and carefully read the directions.  Nothing at all changed. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this two weeks ago and thought I&#x27;d wait to write a review to &amp;#34;put it to the test&amp;#34;.  My eyelashes and eyebrows totally fell out from chemotherapy.  They are sparse and slowly coming back.  To my horror, I&#x27;ve developed some that are completely white. I swim laps in a saltwater/chlorine pool and even though I was using the absolute best waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve ever found, I&#x27;d still end up with raccoon eyes after exiting the pool...the worst part is that soap wouldn&#x27;t remove the &amp;#34;coon eye&amp;#34; problem, only makeup remover, if I happened to have some with me, would.  I&#x27;ve probably tried over 40 different brands of mascara in my lifetime and the best waterproof one I&#x27;ve found is &amp;#34;Bad Girl Lash&amp;#34;.  Anyway, thought I&#x27;d try this.  Although I&#x27;ve applied mascara for more than 30 years perfectly, for some crazy reason I was getting this all over the place (thank goodness for Q-tips).  I finally swapped the &amp;#34;single lash applicator&amp;#34; for a clean mascara wand I had. I couldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;under-eye protection papers&amp;#34; to stay at all, which was o-k, because if I cleaned up a splatter immediately with a Q-tip, it wouldn&#x27;t stain my skin.  Incidentally, there is a tiny splatter on my lower cheek that I never saw and it hasn&#x27;t faded for two weeks, so clean up spills immediately and don&#x27;t even try this if you have a shaky hand. I tinted both sides of my upper lashes and just the top side of my bottoms.  For my eyebrows, I used it sparingly.  After washing the product off, I noticed the tips of the lower lashes weren&#x27;t colored (they may have gotten Vaseline on them), so I re-colored them.  Be extremely careful to not get the developer in your eyes, as it burns like the dickens.  I&#x27;d recommend that you not throw the color and developer away until you see if you need to re-color.  It&#x27;s important to know that although this darkens the lashes, it doesn&#x27;t make them thicker, so if you have puny lashes, you may still want to &amp;#34;plump them up&amp;#34; with a building mascara.  I soap up my entire face twice a day and the color has only faded a little from the very tips of my lashes, so I&#x27;d recommend this to those with a steady hand.</li>
    <li> It was virtually impossible for me to hole this pink &amp;#34;paddle&amp;#34; under my eyelashes and paint on the mascara without getting it on the skin.  Very uncomfortable near my eye.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> I followed directions to the T and it just did not work, plus it hurt my eyes.  Just say no.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactly, even did the 24 hour skin test.  When I went to apply the dye it got everywhere besides my lashes.  I tried painting it on with the sticks and then used the comb to apply it.  I did get &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; on my lashes but when I applied the sealer it smeared the tint and got in my eyes.  It burned like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Also my hands and fingernails are a horrible shade of brown.&lt;br /&gt;If they could make a dye with a mascara applicator, maybe it would work better.&lt;br /&gt;VERY disappointing!</li>
    <li> this product was supposed to darken my eyelashes, but it didn&#x27;t, even though I applied it 3 times hoping it would work.</li>
    <li> Firstly, quickest shipping ever. Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product review: AMAZING! I cannot believe what a difference it made on my eyebrows and lashes. I used tape instead of the supplied under eye shields and used a color barrier around my eyebrows. I had to redo one of my eyes but no problem. There is a learning curve and just build if you have to. I had q-tips on hand for quick mistake clean-ups and removed the product at the end with Ponds face wipes. Too easy. One of the best beauty secrets I&#x27;ve encountered and I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this all these years!! Will update if it fades but I imagine it&#x27;s probably like hair color, less washing the better so I plan to not use my facial cleanser on my brows and will be safe with other products. It&#x27;s worth it. I love my results and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward to put on the first time, but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s easy. I recommend Aquaphor or vaseline around the eye area (but not touching the lashes!) and using a small lash or brow brush to apply the gel and activator. But my lashes were noticeably darker and that lasted for a few weeks for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I love the eyebrow tint this same company makes and I have very light colored lashes. This product was just sub par. I am no professional but do not usually have trouble using DIY beauty products. First off, they recommend using petroleum jelly to adhere the &amp;#34;eye shields&amp;#34; to your under eyes. Not only do the eye shields NOT stick, you are introducing an oily substance when the directions clearly state to keep eye area free of oil and to use an oil free makeup remover before applying. I did not find the product to be that irritating to my eyes, but it was difficult to apply and remove and did not even produce the desired dark lash results. Time to try a different and hopefully more effective product.</li>
    <li> This is a single application consisting of two one inch square plastic envelopes and not a single kit which is a bottle and a tube of product containing multiple applications. Way overpriced.  I was misled</li>
    <li> The color wasn&#x27;t strong enough, a bit messy to use. This is a fair product. I will use it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t suggest this product. While it dyed my eyelashes, the color was quite faint. Not only that, but it was really bothersome to my eyes. It dyed my fingers more than my eyelashes. Instead, I found using cheapy Sally&#x27;s semi-permanent hair dye to be far better. I use Adore, black velvet. Brush it in, leave it for 20 minutes, rinse off. No red, weeping eyes, just black lashes lasting for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> For sure it does NOT last for 28 days....maybe a week at most.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> this not a good product dont biy it</li>
    <li> Absolute waste of money. I did it twice, followed the directions very carefully. Nothing. DID NOT WORK. Do not waste your money on this product</li>
    <li> very good product.  Would buy it again.  In the middle of the 28 days and die is still retaining color.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dark hair and eyelashes.  I bought this product thinking that it would darken my eyelashes up a bit to make it look like I was always wearing mascara.  It didn&#x27;t work at all for me, absolutely nothing.  It&#x27;s very difficult to apply because you have two different solutions to attempt to get on your eyelashes without staining your skin and you can&#x27;t mix the two solutions.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I tried this product...&lt;br /&gt;I use same kind my salon.&lt;br /&gt;But This product doesn&#x27;t work anyway...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to order this company anymore.</li>
    <li> my eyelashes are thin so i didn&#x27;t notice a difference when i colored them.  However, when i used it to color my brows...WOW what a difference it makes.  When i color my brows with 28 Day Mascara i only have to use a pencil to cover the spots with no hair.  Saves a lot of time.</li>
    <li> I tried it. I did not see a difference after using it. I was hoping for darker looking lashes and eyebrows. The eyebrows look a tad darker but not much. The eyelashes are not darker at all.  The instructions could be improved on some by allowing someone who has actually used the product to write them.  For the money (under $20), it was worth the try but I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> Godefroy 28 Day MASCARA Permanent Eyelash/Eyebrow Tint, in Black: This is an eyelash dye/tint that doesn&#x27;t require \\&quot;developer\\&quot;..therefore making it safer to use close to the eye. I applied it twice (2 x within 1 hour) in an attempt to stain my eyelashes, which are light at the tips/ends...glopped it on because I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t getting enough of it on my lashes...very messy &amp; didn&#x27;t darken them much at all and smears even after cleaning it off. Used the product in \\&quot;black\\&quot; several times over the course of time...not very happy with results considering all the mess &amp; time. Plan to search for another product in attempt to find something that darkens lashes better, quicker &amp; without several applications.</li>
    <li> This product gave me black eyelashes as advertised. It was a little tedious and difficult to get all lashes, especially with the applicator provided. I think I will buy disposable mascara wands next time I use it. But I would use it again. It&#x27;s not a replacement for mascara but good for those of us who have blonde or very light eyelashes and don&#x27;t want to appear as if we have no lashes when our mascara comes off.</li>
    <li> It was a waste of  money.  It did not last more than  a day!  glad I only got a one time application!</li>
    <li> I get my eyebrows professionally tinted. I however have not tried this, because it&#x27;s a tiny one single use thing. I didn&#x27;t feel like messing with a one tim thing and leaving myself with stains etc.. Still get it done professionally at a salon.</li>
    <li> The wife love it... thanks</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me - although I did notice it on my lower lashes. As the box says, it&#x27;s probably more effective with fair-haired women.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product because it didn&#x27;t stay on but one week.&lt;br /&gt;It was also hard to not get in on you skin.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as expected.  Was very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast and last for several weeks as noted, it also looks natural.  I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I have red hair but blond eyelashes, so I usually have to apply mascara everyday even just to go to the grocery store... This product was super easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t burn nearly as much as some people claim. It worked fantasticly... I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Well the product was easy to use. Had plenty left over even though is says one application. For me.. the dye only lasted a couple of weeks at most. I think I will be trying a different dye next time.</li>
