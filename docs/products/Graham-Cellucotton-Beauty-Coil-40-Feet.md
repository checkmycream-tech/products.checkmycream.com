      <li>This was an awesome purchase that saved me trips to CVS.</li>
      <li>its great cotton!</li>
      <li>This cotton coil is perfect for cleaning my grout and tile.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great in any atty.</li>
      <li>Works great for my vape pens</li>
      <li>I was so happy.  </li>
      <li>Great product and seller.</li>
      <li>Clean taste, superb retention, and it is already in strips, perfect!</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Good value.</li>
      <li>Dipped them in bleach and let them sit overnight on the affected areas and it worked like magic!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I can figure out more ways to use this beauty coil in cleaning projects!</li>
      <li>I have wicks for the varitas for a year plus, working good, no bad flavors</li>
      <li>Easy, effective and inexpensive.</li>
      <li>This cotton coil can be used for so many things because it is sturdy but you can pull it apart into sections and use it for so many things.  </li>
      <li>and I love the stuff</li>
      <li>and I was able to lay press the coil into the grout lines and it stayed.  </li>
      <li>So oddly enough I use this to soak in bleach and lay around the perimeter of the shower to get rid of mold, and it works great!</li>
      <li>It is the most absorbant substance I have found that has no aweful dryburn taste.</li>
      <li>Cotton as a rule will absorb liquids better than the synthetic.</li>
      <li>, I kow many people use Vaseline on their forehead to keep the hair color from stain the forehead</li>
      <li>works pretty darn good as a Wick</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better quality cotton coil (that doesn&#x27;t tear quite so easy) in a plastic bag before.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to use with bleach in order to clean my shower!</li>
      <li>I used organic Japanese cotton which is great as wicking material and this even better it seems it holds e liquid better and lasts longer.</li>
      <li>break-in period is maybe a few puffs and after that its perfect.</li>
      <li>Taste is clean, not a lot of junk in the fibers, and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>To be honest I don&#x27;t really know what the intended purpose of cellucotton is</li>
      <li>found that idea on pinterest and this is where i found the product to do it, super easy</li>
      <li>I bought this originally for my hair color</li>
      <li>bought it to clean my tub.</li>
      <li>I happen to need at the time, and press the coil to the area I want clean.</li>
      <li>Regular cotton balls do as good a job.</li>
      <li>Quick service.</li>
      <li>it went quickly and i bought it here</li>
      <li>I had to open the top of the box because if I pulled it out of the top opening slot it would NOT come out in one piece.</li>
      <li>Definitally worth it.</li>
      <li>which one is better so far I like this cotton a lot.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price for the quality and quantity.</li>
      <li>Well worth the $</li>
      <li>, good money spent .would buy again and have recommended to friends.</li>
      <li>And price is right.</li>
      <li>It will stay put until I am ready to remove it, and Voila, clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>We were consistently battling mold in my husband&#x27;s shower.</li>
      <li>thing that you&#x27;ll want to do differently is make sure you&#x27;re using thicker wicks.</li>
      <li>I recommend to try it my vaping brothers and sisters ;).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- denser than regular cotton, holds more of whatever you want it to carry&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I have to use it more to make final conclusion</li>
      <li>You get lots of flavor with this cotton and it doesn&#x27;t burn as easy as Japanese cotton.</li>
      <li>I much prefer organic cotton for my wicks.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The pin said to soak beauty coil in bleach and lay it over the mold...walk away and come back to a sparkling clean shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No flavor, highly absorbent, and very durable.</li>
      <li>True, it is a &amp;#34;coil&amp;#34; being one length, but very fragile.</li>
      <li>We could get the mold in the main part of the shower, but the grout was an issue.</li>
      <li>Cellucotton seems to shrink a tad when its fully soaked, so make sure the wick is in there tight</li>
      <li>better efficiency - can use as little as you want</li>
      <li>I run 100 percent vg elixir that I make and even though it might take a second for the first drop to sink in this stuff holds a noticeable amount more than other materials.  </li>
      <li>This is full, soft and substantial and did exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>The basement shower of our house was moldy along the caulk when we purchased it, but since we so rarely use the shower, it took me a year to finally get around to working on cleaning it.  </li>
      <li>i poured bleach into a disposable pie tin and soaked the cotton in it, then i laied it along the grout on my tub over night and the next morning when i took it off my group was mold free and sparkly white again.</li>
      <li>I paint my nails very frequently</li>
      <li>Pure white cleanliness in hours.</li>
      <li>Bought them to clean mildew off my shower (from previous home owner).</li>
      <li>Completely exceeded my expectations of what coiled cotton should be.</li>
      <li>And that was only because I gave the remaining half of my first box to a friend in need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This coil lets you control how much or how little you want to use for removing makeup, applying toner, removing nail polish, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but u have to really let it dry out before you notice it, and even then the stuff retains enough liquid that it won&#x27;t be burnt and trashed like other wicks.</li>

<li> For darker juices I can usually go a week or so.</li>

<li> I bought this product because I was tired of always buying cotton balls.</li>
<li> you get a ridiculous amount for the price!</li>
<li> Awful taste -</li>

    <li> Excellent to use for wicking in atomizers for vaping too!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great in any atty. It is the most absorbant substance I have found that has no aweful dryburn taste. There is some burn taste but u have to really let it dry out before you notice it, and even then the stuff retains enough liquid that it won&#x27;t be burnt and trashed like other wicks. I run 100 percent vg elixir that I make and even though it might take a second for the first drop to sink in this stuff holds a noticeable amount more than other materials.  Clean taste, superb retention, and it is already in strips, perfect!</li>
    <li> We were consistently battling mold in my husband&#x27;s shower. We could get the mold in the main part of the shower, but the grout was an issue. We found a cleaning tip on pinterest where you soak this in bleach, press into grout, and let sit. It worked wonders! Grout is still gone 3 months later</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better quality cotton coil (that doesn&#x27;t tear quite so easy) in a plastic bag before.  I prefer plastic because as you use the product (or anything else for that matter) it shrinks up accordingly and takes up less space.  The box tends to get squished somewhere along the line.</li>
    <li> I purchased Graham Cellucotton to use as wicking in a rebuildable atomizer for an e-cig. Taste is clean, not a lot of junk in the fibers, and easy to work with. This box will last for a very long time. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I used organic Japanese cotton which is great as wicking material and this even better it seems it holds e liquid better and lasts longer. You get lots of flavor with this cotton and it doesn&#x27;t burn as easy as Japanese cotton. I have to use it more to make final conclusion which one is better so far I like this cotton a lot. And price is right. I recommend to try it my vaping brothers and sisters ;).</li>
    <li> Just add bleach and put on the tub grout.  Cleanest grout ever!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use in a Pinterest cleaning project.  The basement shower of our house was moldy along the caulk when we purchased it, but since we so rarely use the shower, it took me a year to finally get around to working on cleaning it.  The pin said to soak beauty coil in bleach and lay it over the mold...walk away and come back to a sparkling clean shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And...it worked! I was so happy.  some of the grout lines had a few spots too and I was able to lay press the coil into the grout lines and it stayed.  No scrubbing involved.  I&#x27;m sure I can figure out more ways to use this beauty coil in cleaning projects! If not, I&#x27;ll just use it to remove nail polish.</li>
    <li> So oddly enough I use this to soak in bleach and lay around the perimeter of the shower to get rid of mold, and it works great!</li>
    <li> I have wicks for the varitas for a year plus, working good, no bad flavors, good money spent .would buy again and have recommended to friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was tired of always buying cotton balls. I paint my nails very frequently and I always would run out of cotton balls. This was an awesome purchase that saved me trips to CVS. Shipping was speedy.</li>
    <li> Good product. Quick service.</li>
    <li> Found a tip online to soak the coil in bleach and wrap around a shower/tub where you have mold and mildew. I leave it overnight and it works like a charm. Easy, effective and inexpensive. Good value.</li>
    <li> Bought them to clean mildew off my shower (from previous home owner). Dipped them in bleach and let them sit overnight on the affected areas and it worked like magic!</li>
    <li> To be honest I don&#x27;t really know what the intended purpose of cellucotton is but I&#x27;ve been using it as wicking for e-liquid atomizers for a year or so now. I&#x27;ve gone through tons of silica, cotton, Japanese cotton, mesh, etc. over the years and none of it stacks up to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The break-in period is maybe a few puffs and after that its perfect. No flavor, highly absorbent, and very durable. I often go two weeks without re-wicking with lighter juices. For darker juices I can usually go a week or so. With Japanese cotton and regular cotton I could get maybe two days maximum out of a wick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you get a ridiculous amount for the price! Anytime I have a friend who vapes over I offer them some. In the year (plus a few months) I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve gone through two boxes. And that was only because I gave the remaining half of my first box to a friend in need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that you&#x27;ll want to do differently is make sure you&#x27;re using thicker wicks. With regular cotton you always had to use thinner wicks so that they didn&#x27;t choke once they swelled with juice. Cellucotton seems to shrink a tad when its fully soaked, so make sure the wick is in there tight and you&#x27;ll be puffing away without issue for weeks!</li>
    <li> I bought this cotton to take the mold out of the grout around my tub.  I got the idea from someone on Pintrest and it worked well.  This cotton coil held up to the bleach and did the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally for my hair color and it works, I kow many people use Vaseline on their forehead to keep the hair color from stain the forehead, how ever I like to keep the color away from my face.&lt;br /&gt;This has help a lot.</li>
    <li> Cotton as a rule will absorb liquids better than the synthetic. This is full, soft and substantial and did exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I do a mani/pedi every week and thought this might make the job easier, but it is not at all like the stuff the nail salons use.  will not order this again. It is too thin. Regular cotton balls do as good a job.</li>
    <li> I used this with bleach along my grout lines.  A few hours later they were white, I needed to spot apply a second time in a couple places.  Definitally worth it.</li>
    <li> Use this for the hard to reach corners of the sink, bath and, shower. I soak in bleach and lay it along the edges of the moldy looking trim. Pure white cleanliness in hours. Lasts for months. Well worth the $</li>
    <li> It is so small for price....</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with bleach in order to clean my shower! Worked great! Would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I use this to clean my shower - lay it down when the grout/caulk is dirty or mildewy, soak with bleach water, and let sit for an hour. Then peel it up and rinse with water. No scrubbing!</li>
    <li> Great product and seller.</li>
    <li> Used for cleaning.  I soaked it in vinegar &amp; baking soda &amp; placed it where the tub and wall met.  I left it for a few hours and it cleaned off all the dirt.  This cotton coil can be used for so many things because it is sturdy but you can pull it apart into sections and use it for so many things.  Well worth the price for the quality and quantity.</li>
    <li> It was white, fluffy and coiled, but behaved like cotton balls.  Completely exceeded my expectations of what coiled cotton should be.</li>
    <li> Works great for my vape pens</li>
    <li> I use it for rebuilding and making coils for electronic cigs and I love the stuff</li>
    <li> Awful taste - I much prefer organic cotton for my wicks.</li>
    <li> I got this because I felt like I wasn&#x27;t being efficient with my cotton balls.  This coil lets you control how much or how little you want to use for removing makeup, applying toner, removing nail polish, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- denser than regular cotton, holds more of whatever you want it to carry&lt;br /&gt;- better efficiency - can use as little as you want&lt;br /&gt;- cotton pulls out cleanly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- not as soft as other cotton balls.  Not very coarse either, but noticeably rougher&lt;br /&gt;- if you lose your end, you end up ripping a piece in the middle and the coil gets messed up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: The pros and cons balance out for me.  I think it would just depend on my mood whether or not I buy again.</li>
    <li> works pretty darn good as a Wick</li>
    <li> This cotton coil is perfect for cleaning my grout and tile. I soak it in whatever cleaning solution I happen to need at the time, and press the coil to the area I want clean. It will stay put until I am ready to remove it, and Voila, clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> bought it to clean my tub. i poured bleach into a disposable pie tin and soaked the cotton in it, then i laied it along the grout on my tub over night and the next morning when i took it off my group was mold free and sparkly white again. found that idea on pinterest and this is where i found the product to do it, super easy</li>
    <li> It meet my expectations,&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;JAI</li>
    <li> not for every vaping purpose  like in kayfuns  not good  but in RDA&#x27;s  Whoo hoo</li>
    <li> its great cotton! im a licensed cosmetologist and this stuff is all i use. it went quickly and i bought it here cause they ran out of it at my local beauty store. i would recommend!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture! It doesn&#x27;t look at all like the picture. It looks like something you would pull out of an aspirin bottle. True, it is a &amp;#34;coil&amp;#34; being one length, but very fragile. I had to open the top of the box because if I pulled it out of the top opening slot it would NOT come out in one piece. I am using this to soak it in bleach to apply it to some mildew on the caulk in the shower so the bleach has extra contact with the mildew (not my idea, search and found it). Would not buy again.</li>
