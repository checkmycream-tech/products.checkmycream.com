      <li>The way this feels on my skin is great!  </li>
      <li>I also shared it with my best friend this weekend, who immediately snapped a photo of it on her phone so that she could buy some as well.</li>

      <li>It makes your skin feel very good, but I have not noticed any difference in the volume filler.</li>
      <li>As a moisturizer, this does a great job.</li>

      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wanted an effective night cream, but I can&#x27;t endorse the claims about volumizing.</li>
      <li>but you won&#x27;t get this nice result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But the start is excellent and she really enjoys the texture.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been as honest as I can and hope I covered all questions</li>

      <li>Nice to get some thing that makes you feel better about your appearance.</li>
      <li>This L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift feels great, smooth and light.</li>
      <li>My wife loves the smell and it went on very smooth.  </li>
      <li>also don&#x27;t like the jar packaging since jars can introduce bacteria each time you dip a finger in and also also more prone to degradation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I love this cream much better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I won&#x27;t be buying any more of it.</li>
      <li>really do love</li>
      <li>You will know for sure by then&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Plus, if it doesn&#x27;t work, the result makes me feel more confident in the products I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The jar may be more aesthetically pleasing but a tube is just more practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Seemed to immediately make my skin look better.</li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer</li>

      <li>: I&#x27;m 44, mostly keep out of the sun, wash my face with water alone, seldom wear face makeup.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>And the results, it was satisfying and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Many soaps, lotions, and conditioners make me itch, but this does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>makes the skin more youthful-looking.  </li>
      <li>Thank you L&#x27;Oreal Paris for a great new product for me.</li>
      <li>The jar is well designed in an attractive lavender color - nice enough to leave it sitting out on the counter if I wanted to.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too soon for me to report about the anti-aging features of this cream, but having a very dry skin, I can attest about its excellent hydrating characteristics.</li>
      <li>While you don&#x27;t feel anything on your skin, the finish is a smooth, pore-free texture that reminds me of DHC Velvet SkinCoat, my favorite primer/filler, and the closest thing to makeup I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Easy to put on</li>
      <li>It has strong scent but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>do not have a strong sense of smell.</li>
      <li>You may want to avoid this if strong smells get to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The review about the smell being really strong isn&#x27;t accurate.</li>
      <li>After using it for a week, I don&#x27;t see any difference in the fine lines on my face.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s light, and there is some improvement.</li>
      <li>I use it primarily as a night cream and use on hands, chest, neck and face.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Problem is I got this free for evaluation purposes.</li>
      <li>make-up goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>This stuff left my face feeling great.  </li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied with its non-miraculous performance of keeping my dry skin moisturized in a pleasant, unobtrusive manner.</li>
      <li>The Revitalift skin care cream is rich and creamy and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>That is a good thing, because current research shows retinol is much more effective than retinyl palmitate, and the hyaluronic acid being used in the new formulas</li>
      <li>Feels great on my face - I like it better than a lot of things I have used previously.</li>
      <li>skin in a week, and forehead &amp; nasolabial wrinkles significantly reduced in 4 weeks.</li>
      <li>This unique product replenish hadraunic acid</li>
      <li>In the past, I tried their skin care products, but none of them were impressive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall if you need moisturizer and some plumping this along with the other products in the Blur line have been good !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really excited about this product.  </li>
      <li>In fact, given all the ingredients in this moisturizer it needed a little fragrance, good thing that it&#x27;s pretty pleasant.</li>
      <li>I forget I am wearing it because it absorbs so cleanly.</li>
      <li>But she wanted something better than the Vaseline she was using, and with this cream her skin feels much smoother and softer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>yes, it &amp;#34;sits&amp;#34; on top of the skin instead of absorbing, so it doesnt blend well with my foundation..</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been using its True Match powders and hair colors for quite some time.</li>
      <li>I should note that she didn&#x27;t have any wrinkles and her skin was not bad to begin with.</li>
      <li>Given the ingredient list it&#x27;s easy to see why this moisturizer is not heavy and sticky like more oil based moisturizers.</li>
      <li>(One of my favorites is Origins’ Perfect World Age-defense skin guardian with White Tea, but I also like newcomers such as L&#x27;Occitane Divine Youth Oil.)</li>
      <li>More importantly, this cream didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or cause me to break out.</li>
      <li>Those who have combination, oily, or normal skin may love it, though.</li>
      <li>Some users may find the fragrance too strong, as have some other reviewers, but I kind of like it.</li>
      <li>a cheap one with a really pungent odor.</li>
      <li>tell my husband that I&#x27;m worth it .....</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>This elegant cream makes my skin so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>(yeah, it&#x27;s fun.</li>
      <li>Of course, I know we have to take that for what it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is worth the try  </li>
      <li>It is thick and goes on very nice and smooth.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very thick cream, which feels good on my skin during this time of year (winter), but be warned that it has a very strong smell that is almost a bit too overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I see a difference right away.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought because a lot of the reviews said it was moisturizing, that I would feel the positive effects (volumizing, plumping and moisturization) but within a few hours, it actually began drying out my skin. Initially, it feels hydrating but then doesn&#x27;t last. I will continue to use it a couple of times a week to see if I get any benefit from it but am somewhat disappointed in it&#x27;s performance as of now.</li>
    <li> Great product. May buy again. www.createmine.com</li>
    <li> A luxuriously hydrating cream, this formula contains a lot of hyaluronic acid, which is one of nature&#x27;s best moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that the L&#x27;oreal Revitalift line is veering away from its vitamin A formulation, which it used for years, since the 80&#x27;s.  That is a good thing, because current research shows retinol is much more effective than retinyl palmitate, and the hyaluronic acid being used in the new formulas is definitely an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this cream because it is deeply hydrating without being greasy and it really plumps up the skin!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is an amped up version of their regular Revitalift moisturizer in that it has the added benefit of \\&quot;re-volumizing.\\&quot; I can see a slight benefit after only a few applications. My skin feels softer and it looks a little plumper.  I was already a fan of the simpler version, but would buy this instead.  Of course, nothing will make decades of life disappear. At least, nothing I am interested in doing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very dry here in the desert, even more so in the winter. But as much as I dislike dry, crackly-feeling skin, greasy lotions or moisturizers are even worse. This L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift feels great, smooth and light. It has a nice scent when it goes on but doesn&#x27;t linger. In fact, once it&#x27;s on, I forget all about it, which is exactly what I want. As for its wrinkle-reducing properties, well, it doesn&#x27;t work miracles. Maybe it has some effect but it&#x27;s pretty subtle. I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied with its non-miraculous performance of keeping my dry skin moisturized in a pleasant, unobtrusive manner.</li>
    <li> L’Oreal Paris’ Re-Volumizing moisturizer soothes and eliminates fine lines and wrinkles as well as a natural feel to the skin.  Having used various moisturizers in the past, I can say, especially upon handling the jar and unscrewing the top, there is no doubt I was in store for a quality experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things that I tend to notice when using moisturizers, most have a loose and liquid cream and a scent.  L’Oreal does not possess those traits but a nice subtle scent and cream, and it was easy to apply.  And the results, it was satisfying and refreshing.  In addition, as the contents state, the moisturizer improves and hyrdrates, volumizes, and replenishes the skin.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t strip my skin like other lotions that promise to minimize wrinkles and such. I&#x27;ve got pretty sensitive skin, skin that gets very dry and flaky in the winter (yeah, it&#x27;s fun. Adds insult to injury, if you ask me. Thanks, body.) so I&#x27;m having to slather on the lotion in the morning and at night. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, should some get up in that area (which it does, since I tend to rub my cheek then touch my eye...a bad habit). I don&#x27;t know about plumping -- I&#x27;m already pretty plump so that filled in a lot of the little wrinkles that were showing up on my face but it definitely moisturizes and, hey, I got carded at the grocery store! That&#x27;s always a good thing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used a L&#x27;Oreal product, but I&#x27;ve always liked their products in the past, so I was eager to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very thick cream, which feels good on my skin during this time of year (winter), but be warned that it has a very strong smell that is almost a bit too overpowering.  You may want to avoid this if strong smells get to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive and often gets red and irritated when I try out a new product, but this didn&#x27;t aggravate it.  It works by providing a temporary smoothing feeling, and the silicone in it (dimethicone) works to almost \\&quot;spackle\\&quot; the skin so any other makeup products go on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a matte finish, which I don&#x27;t actually like.  At the age of 43, I prefer for my skin to have a glow to it since I feel like a nice glow makes the skin more youthful-looking.  If you don&#x27;t mind a matte finish, you&#x27;ll probably like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like the jar packaging since jars can introduce bacteria each time you dip a finger in and also also more prone to degradation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When buying skincare products, I always check Paula Begoun&#x27;s Beautopedia website.  While she doesn&#x27;t yet have this product listed since it&#x27;s too new, the other Revitalift products have ratings of \\&quot;poor\\&quot; and \\&quot;average,\\&quot; except for one Revitalift product that has a rating of \\&quot;good.\\&quot;  She mentions that most of the other Revitalift products are just regular moisturizers that don&#x27;t live up to their claims because they lack state-of-the-art ingredients.  Of course, I know we have to take that for what it&#x27;s worth.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not too impressed with this.  While I do like how it smooths in lines, the strong smell, matte finish, and lack of evidence for good anti-aging ingredients makes me think that I will go back to using some of my tried-and-true products that have more evidence behind them, such as Olay Regenerist Serum and my antioxidant serums.</li>
    <li> Like:&lt;br /&gt;- It does moisturize your skin well.&lt;br /&gt;- Absorbs into the skin well and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:&lt;br /&gt;- It feels a little thick / heavy to me.  That could just be me, some others say it&#x27;s not at all heavy feeling.  Still, personally I can still sort of feel it on my face and hand hours after applying it (even after washing my hands a few times).  I forget to take off my beaded ring before applying and the lotion that I got on it was a pain to scrub off.&lt;br /&gt;- It does have a scent.  Not a super heavy scent but one that did bother me a bit.  On the plus side it didn&#x27;t stick around for long, but the few minutes I could smell it, I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent moisturizer.  Not my favorite, personally, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> After a week of use I can report no noticeable change in the condition of the skin on my face. I am fortunate to have minimal wrinkles so far, but even the tiny crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes didn&#x27;t seem to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do like this product. Initially the thickness of the product was unappealing, but used at night, it seems to provide a layer of protection which seals in moisture for hours. After washing my face in the morning there is less tightness of the skin, even though the product by this time has been worn or washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I don&#x27;t feel as though I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product after the initial jar is gone. While it works well as a moisturizer, there are other moisturizing products at less cost which I&#x27;ve used and been equally satisfied with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I think there aren&#x27;t any &amp;#34;magic potions&amp;#34; to take away the changes aging naturally produces. My interest is just for a product that makes my skin feel comfortable; I don&#x27;t expect to look 16 years old again.</li>
    <li> This product is very different from any moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s non-greasy and absorbs well, but the big difference is the finish. While you don&#x27;t feel anything on your skin, the finish is a smooth, pore-free texture that reminds me of DHC Velvet SkinCoat, my favorite primer/filler, and the closest thing to makeup I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product alone morning and night, no serum, and wash my face with water alone. My nose and cheeks have been chapped a lot this winter, but it hasn&#x27;t stung or irritated my skin, and no breakouts, which are sometimes a problem for me. The scent is very strong on application, but disaappates immediately. I&#x27;ve discontinued some fancy creams I&#x27;ve tried for the lingering smell. While I&#x27;m not crazy about this one, it&#x27;s gone by the time it absorbs into my skin, so it actually didn&#x27;t register in my brain until reading other reviews (now I wonder how I missed it--it&#x27;s very strong indeed!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels soft and moisturized. As with Velvet SkinCoat, I feel that it does reduce the appearance of fine lines, especially around my eyes, pretty much immediately, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve actually disappeared; it&#x27;s more that the product is something of a filler. Either way, my skin looks good. (If I feel there are lasting changes by the end of the jar, I&#x27;ll report back.) If you like bare skin with a moist, dewy appearance, you won&#x27;t like this. If you like a pore-free finish on bare skin or wear face makeup, I&#x27;d recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin background: I&#x27;m 44, mostly keep out of the sun, wash my face with water alone, seldom wear face makeup. My skin is very dry if untreated, and particularly bad in the winter. While I don&#x27;t mind actual oil on my skin, I don&#x27;t like greasy creams, so I prefer non-greasy formulas that soak in readily (light oils tend to soak in readily as well). I can&#x27;t tolerate most chemical sunscreen on my face for daily use (though I can take an occasional light application in the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry). Until a few years ago, I used whatever unscented lotion was on hand or olive oil on my face. After a particularly dry winter where I was applying oil 4x a day and still looking like a parched crone, and having frequent rosacea flareups (normally very mild at worst, seldom a problem outside of winter), I decided to finally try a dedicated facial skin product. I started using Kehil&#x27;s Ultra and I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results. Occasionally I try something new, hoping to find something a little cheaper (lately the L&#x27;oreal revitalift and youth code, because of the insane sale+subscribe&amp;save+coupon savings  on Amazon last month).ry).

    <li> This moisturizer works in tandem with the face serum from L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Skin care line of products. This is a reasonably priced moisturizer given its anti-aging properties and skin plumpers. There are some other moisturizers like Juice Beauty that are composed of more natural ingredients and are not too much more expensive than this moisturizer and may have longer term effects than this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients in this product is similar to the ingredients in the face serum from the same line of products but there are more filler materials and less concentration of cell reapir ingredients such as sodium hyaluronate. Silica which is a filler material found in many cosmetics is the 4th ingredient in this moisturizer after glycerin, dimethicone (emollient for itchy and dry skin), isohexadecane (a non-sticky emollient solvent). Given the ingredient list it&#x27;s easy to see why this moisturizer is not heavy and sticky like more oil based moisturizers. It has a matte finish rather than a shiny finish that makes it a great make up base. It does feel smoother after application, which makes a good make up base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does sting my skin a little and causes some redness on drier parts of the face like cheeks. My Juice Beauty moisturizer that had more natural ingredients did not sting my skin as much but it&#x27;s heavier and oilier so not a great base for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think there will be too many longer  lasting effects of this moisturizer but it will protect your skin fand also provides a good non-sticky base to apply makeup and works as a day moisturizer in the winter over the serum. The fragrance is nice, I don&#x27;t find it over-powering. In fact, given all the ingredients in this moisturizer it needed a little fragrance, good thing that it&#x27;s pretty pleasant.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have ever written about a product. This serum and cream burned my skin so badly and turned red immediately with swelling after putting it on - I had to immediately remove it. Would not recommend at all! I am 42 and do not have sensitive skin usually to cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I wanted to take a little bit of time to see if there were any noticeable differences in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am using a combination of this product and their Visible Lift Blur foundation / and Revialift Miracle Blur product for eyes&lt;br /&gt;Used together they seem to help a little with  the Blur line being my favorite&lt;br /&gt; BUT&lt;br /&gt;Back to this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- it does NOT have an over powering odor. So those who have allergies will like that&lt;br /&gt;2- it is creamy and lightweight. Easy to put on&lt;br /&gt;3- skin feels softer&lt;br /&gt;4- I have cheeks that are naturally not in need of plumping. It&#x27;s my chin that&#x27;s does  I see a slight improvement over the month . Slight is better than NONE (which is what I get from most products!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you need moisturizer and some plumping this along with the other products in the Blur line have been good ! They work together and they do decrease lines and &#x27;pit&#x27; marks etc&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the try  There is more than enough for at least 2-3 months  You will know for sure by then&lt;br /&gt;And as I noted , it should not bother allergy sufferers like myself&lt;br /&gt;I hope this has helped&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been as honest as I can and hope I covered all questions</li>
    <li> I find that the volume filler moisturizer doesn&#x27;t penetrate into my skin. It rolls up in little balls when I touch my face. I only use it at night because it doesn&#x27;t mix with my foundation and rolls up even worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early forties. And have tried several products over the years, and I have never seen quicker results. Crepey eyelids are smoother, cheeks are fuller and skin is just younger and softer. Makeup goes on like it did in my late twenties. I really only had minor wrinkles ,  and now they have virtually disappeared . It has really changed my skin.</li>
    <li> I just started using it so I cant tell if its working, but in the interim its already breaking me out in two places. Its not so much that the cream is &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34;, but it feels plastic like and fake, and yes, it &amp;#34;sits&amp;#34; on top of the skin instead of absorbing, so it doesnt blend well with my foundation.. it also feels weird on my face.. very much like Im wearing a waxy coating. ugh.</li>
    <li> I got a burning sensation on my face , and my face was very red</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 6 days. I like the way my skin feels but no miracles happening yet.</li>
    <li> Seemed to immediately make my skin look better.</li>
    <li> It makes your skin feel very good, but I have not noticed any difference in the volume filler.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m puzzled by all the comments I&#x27;m seeiing about the &amp;#34;strong perfumy smell&amp;#34;.  I have been using the Voulme Filler for approximately 3 months now and am on my second jar.  The product has little to no smell!  Perhaps some of these comments are older, and L&#x27;Oreal has now changed the formula??  Don&#x27;t know but just know both of my jars have been practically odorless.  I&#x27;m so pleased with the results!  I use it primarily as a night cream and use on hands, chest, neck and face.  My skin looks much smoother (I&#x27;m 61).  No cream will truly lift sagging skin -- only surgery can do that.  But this is the only cream I&#x27;ve ever used that produced results good enough that I wanted to keep using.  I even had a friend to visit a couple of weeks ago and she wanted to know what I had done -- if I had had a procedure!  It&#x27;s non greasy and has produced no break outs.  I&#x27;m very pleased with how my skin has improved -- just the appearance of my wrinkles is so much less.  I do highly recommend you give this product a try!</li>
    <li> It makes your skin firmed and glow. I even use only this without any foundation when I don&#x27;t have enough time. However, since it&#x27;s quite thick cream, you&#x27;ll have white crumbs on your face sometimes. It has strong scent but doesn&#x27;t bother me. And it contains silicone so I put this on after washed, cleaned and moisturized face only since I&#x27;ve learned silicone works as keeping in moisture but also in any sebum, dirt and bacteria that may already be on the skin (I don&#x27;t have allergy to silicone but don&#x27;t want to have any breakouts).</li>
    <li> I love this product!  You really see a difference in you skin after using it!  I am 69 years old and , yes, I have wrinkles!  But L&#x27;Oreal Volume Filler makes them appear less visible and my skin is very soft after using it.  I have recommended it to all my &amp;#34; young&amp;#34; friend and they also love the results!  Nice to get some thing that makes you feel better about your appearance.</li>
    <li> The Revitalift skin care cream is rich and creamy and goes on smoothly. A small dab on each cheek is all I need for my entire face and neck. It absorbs well without leaving a greasy residue. Although other reviewers have mentioned a strong lingering scent, it seems almost unscented to me. It&#x27;s difficult to say whether there is any &amp;#34;volume filler&amp;#34; effect from this moisturizer. I have very dry skin, and it definitely appears a bit smoother and glowing after use of the L&#x27;Oreal cream. The jar is well designed in an attractive lavender color - nice enough to leave it sitting out on the counter if I wanted to.</li>
    <li> This is truely one of the best skin care products I have ever tried. It goes on smooth and is creamy, but not too thick. I could tell a difference in my skin just a couple of days after I started wearing. I also shared it with my best friend this weekend, who immediately snapped a photo of it on her phone so that she could buy some as well.</li>
    <li> I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.  Feels like waxy residue and clogs my pores.</li>
    <li> This unique product replenish hadraunic acid I used it ..by 2 nd bottle my face looks much fuller on cheeks...other products just tighten ed the skin but this revolutionary product did research I m 58 yes old many people tell me I m only 45&lt;br /&gt;$20 only can save u thousands in expensive derm procedures</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I love the texture, it&#x27;s light, and there is some improvement.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nasty. The only thing I like about it is the smell. It sits on top of your skin...does NOT absorb, and if you try to put anything else on with it or rub your face, it balls up in little pieces. It feels waxy, and doesn&#x27;t work. Clogs my pores, breaks me out, and after having it on for a while, makes my face feel like I put some kind of greasy cooking oil on my face. I&#x27;m just going to throw it out. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon. But I did but it today at target. The review about the smell being really strong isn&#x27;t accurate. And that should&#x27;ve been a reason to only give the product 3 stars. I see a difference right away. I normally don&#x27;t review a product on amazon unless I bought it off amazon, but I was looking thru other peoples reviews and thought I should inform everyone that it&#x27;s a really good product. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I bought the concentrated serum, but it seemed to run out pretty fast, even though I only used a drop or two once a day.  I love this cream much better.  It&#x27;s not greasy, I only use a little, and the jar lasts a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really excited about this product.  I&#x27;ve only been using it less than a week, but my skin seems dewier (is that a word?).  The lines around my eyes are truly less noticeable, and even my under eye crickets have improved.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Our star rating may rise...we like this well enough (having used many similar). It doesn&#x27;t get more stars initially because the &amp;#34;within hours&amp;#34; claim on the back isn&#x27;t quite true. And, they want you to use two other products from their line bringing your total cost to $60. And, well, there&#x27;s really not a lot IN the container...why make it feel so heavy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;replumped&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;firmer&amp;#34; (the box&#x27;s one week claim. But we have noticed improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT have a perfumy smell (a plus, we&#x27;re guys...we don&#x27;t want to smell like a flower garden--we have a flower garden for that). And it goes on and does not leave your skin feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are way more expensive products out there,but if you don&#x27;t want to drop $100 per ounce, I believe this is a good way to go.</li>
    <li> I used this for a week instead of my usual product, eb5 Facial Cream, and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin. I always use a moisturizer after showering, and this product left my skin feeling soft and moisturized.  It is thick, and creamy, and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong, chemical, smell when you put in on, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  The scent seems to dissipate almost immediately, but I would prefer a scent free product like eb5 Facial Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this product is comparable to other moisturizers on the market.</li>
    <li> The way this feels on my skin is great!  I have these lines by my mouth and I noticed a big difference in them after only&lt;br /&gt;a few weeks of use.  I love this product.  It is thick and goes on very nice and smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t have any kind&lt;br /&gt;of scent, I don&#x27;t like creams with scents.  I read the reviews and I thought let me try this and I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every night!  Thank you L&#x27;Oreal Paris for a great new product for me.</li>
    <li> Preliminary use has all the indications of a great product.  So well packaged in the L&#x27;Oreal tradition of elegance.  My wife loves the smell and it went on very smooth.  She has had different treatments in the past and will know in the near future about how this is working.  But the start is excellent and she really enjoys the texture.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice moisturizer for medium to oily skin types.  I received a jar to review, but would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;- Non-oily.  I like to moisturize my face but not add a lot of oil.  I don&#x27;t have problems with dry skin on my face, so I find that this moisturizer works great.&lt;br /&gt;- Scent.  I usually don&#x27;t like strongly-scented products, but I actually didn&#x27;t think this was that bad.&lt;br /&gt;- Price.  Not cheap, but not stratospheric, either.  A good value if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;- No sensitivity.  I do have very sensitive skin that likes to react to anything that I put on it.  After a week of use, this hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation.  Many soaps, lotions, and conditioners make me itch, but this does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;- Does it make you look younger?  After a week of use, I can&#x27;t tell.  My real goal is just to keep my face moisturized.  This stuff left my face feeling great.  I will update this review after a month with any changes in appearance  I notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has turned out to be a lovely replacement for my other oil free product. While it&#x27;s too soon to say whether it is indeed &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34;, the package claims I can expect &amp;#34;replumped&amp;#34; skin in a week, and forehead &amp; nasolabial wrinkles significantly reduced in 4 weeks. It takes awhile to see results. The base of this cream is hyaluronic acid and something called &amp;#34;fibroxyl&amp;#34;. The only reason I felt it worthy of 4 stars rather than 5 is that it wasn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough on the drier areas of my face. For mature skin this is always a problem with creams. Those who have combination, oily, or normal skin may love it, though. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be ANY oil in this product at all, so it&#x27;s very matte on application. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; when I applied sunscreen and/or foundation. It stayed put. It&#x27;s a nice water based product, and I like it very much, but for the Winter, I&#x27;ll need something heavier for the dry areas on my face with my parched skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a few weeks usage I do notice that fine lines are much less noticeable. Deeper lines have also improved, even though they are still there, they are shallower than they were (I&#x27;m talking about the 11&#x27;s between the brows). This product does do what it promises in plumping out areas that need it. But the dry patches on my face are worse &amp; irritable, and in dire need of a light oil based product. When I use foundation these patches show up as if I have blemishes, very red and noticeable. I still feel this is a drawback, this product doesn&#x27;t do the job in moisturizing at all!</li>
    <li> [Good]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works. It does slightly improve wrinkled skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Bad]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a strong sense of smell. I currently have a tough time detecting rubbing alcohol from an open bottle, yet this moisturizer&#x27;s smell is just too strong even for me to use during the day and even at night unless you sleep alone. When people buy this product, they aren&#x27;t buying a fragrance, let alone a cheap one with a really pungent odor. The only thing that super, strong fragrance does is cheapen the product as well as the people wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in a jar instead of a tube. The jar may be more aesthetically pleasing but a tube is just more practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Verdict]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other creams that are just as effective without the crazy, strong nasty odor.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have avoided using L&#x27;Oreal products as they were a division of Lancome and tested on animals. But, I&#x27;ve decided to give the company another try. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Revitalift Re-Volumize Lotion worked extremely well, it goes on smooth and THICK, and is a good hydrating moisturizer to use at night. After using it for over a week, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the volume of my skin tone, but it may be needed to be used for a longer period of time for those results. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars? If you put this creme on at night, in the morning I wake up and my skin feels itchy and a little greasy. Now, this may be because I have very sensitive skin, but the greasy feeling doesn&#x27;t go away until I wash my face. So, overall I think this is a good hydrating product, just not sure if the volume thing works.</li>
    <li> My wife and I are both fans of L’Oreal products. My wife for how they make her look and feel. Me for their high quality and ease of use. (I help my wife color her hair with L’Oreal.) So when she wanted to try this product, I had no reservations. Here’s what she thought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my sensitive combination skin, I’m quite picky about what I put on my face, but I’m always looking for new and potentially better products,  even when I am satisfied with my regular skin care products. (One of my favorites is Origins’ Perfect World Age-defense skin guardian with White Tea, but I also like newcomers such as L&#x27;Occitane Divine Youth Oil.) I like to experiment with new cosmetic technology, but I also like an occasional “affair”, as it seems to stimulate and revive my skin. Plus, if it doesn&#x27;t work, the result makes me feel more confident in the products I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L’Oreal Paris is actually one of a few drugstore brand cosmetics I trust and I&#x27;ve been using its True Match powders and hair colors for quite some time. In the past, I tried their skin care products, but none of them were impressive. But when I saw this new product, my instinct told me that I needed to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for about 10 days. I really like how this thick and fragrant cream penetrates into my skin without leaving greasy residue. Some users may find the fragrance too strong, as have some other reviewers, but I kind of like it. It feels almost like I’m applying a good quality serum. More importantly, this cream didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or cause me to break out. When I use this in the morning after washing my face, however, my face becomes a little greasier than normal after several hours. Unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t given me the result the manufacturer is advertising - at least not yet, but overall, I’m quite satisfied with this and eager to try out other products from the same product line, so I settled at a four star rating.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife to try out. She simply loves it! Within just 2 days her skin felt much smoother. I should note that she didn&#x27;t have any wrinkles and her skin was not bad to begin with. But she wanted something better than the Vaseline she was using, and with this cream her skin feels much smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;Problem is I got this free for evaluation purposes. Now that she likes it I&#x27;m not liking the $20 sticker price! But price aside, this worked very well for my wife, and I would recommend getting it.</li>
    <li> This elegant cream makes my skin so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I really do love it.&lt;br /&gt;You can spend less but you won&#x27;t get this nice result.&lt;br /&gt;I tell my husband that I&#x27;m worth it ..... And he agrees!!&lt;br /&gt;Smart man.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Skin Care Revitalift Daily Re-Volatizing Moisturizer is soothing, thick, and glides on leaving no residue. It is light enough to wear under makeup and to wear at night, too. I forget I am wearing it because it absorbs so cleanly. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles to smooth out, but I do have pushing 50 skin--and it feels great with this product!</li>
    <li> I like L&#x27;Oreal products and have used their moisturizers before and been very pleased with them. This moisturizer is supposed to be a \\&quot;filler,\\&quot; too, i.e., it&#x27;s supposed to plump up your skin a bit so your wrinkles are less obvious. As a moisturizer, this does a great job. My skin feels nourished and make-up goes on smoothly. After using it for a week, I don&#x27;t see any difference in the fine lines on my face. I have used other plumping products before (specifically Lancôme Visionnaire) and have definitely seen a difference, so it may be that the less expensive product don&#x27;t have as much of whatever the active ingredient is. In addition, this product does not contain sunscreen, which is a must to *prevent* wrinkles and other types of sun damage. I also don&#x27;t care for the fragrance. It&#x27;s light enough and dissipates within a half-hour or so, but it reminds me of the old Ponds Cold Cream. It&#x27;s okay, but I won&#x27;t be buying any more of it.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my face - I like it better than a lot of things I have used previously.</li>
    <li> I like the product but the jar was only half full!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon for me to report about the anti-aging features of this cream, but having a very dry skin, I can attest about its excellent hydrating characteristics. I applied it all over my face and neck, and I like how it feels in my skin, and the lasting moisturizer effect. It does have a lingering scent, that I personally like it. It absorbs fast and it can be used as a primer for makeup, I was surprised to notice that it moderately smothered some irregularities on my face, making it smooth but shine-free. As for using it without any makeup, the biggest test for me with this type of product is taking a walk in a windy winter day, and see if it helps to keep my skin hydrated. I just did that, and the L&#x27;Oreal Re-Volatizing Moisturizer passed the test with high colors.</li>
    <li> I had some trouble testing this because when I first put a very small amount on, it stung. I did notice, however, that my skin felt as if it had something on it two days after I&#x27;d applied it (and yes, I had washed my face). The effect was a little powdery, but it also felt smoother (and I don&#x27;t have any complaints about the smoothness of my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use this during the day as it would be too much under my sunscreen, but I did use it at night. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted an effective night cream, but I can&#x27;t endorse the claims about volumizing.</li>
</ol>
