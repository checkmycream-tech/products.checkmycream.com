      <li>The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because some of the studs are too big for my nail and adding more than one makes the design look weird, but rather than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>

<li> The container was very small for 3 dollars but overall the product wasnt too bad.</li>
<li> not happy at all</li>
<li> I got send the wrong item....</li>
<li> I guess not too bad since they are just silver underneath.</li>
<li> I ordered to get this crap</li>

    <li> I love to add studs to my nails to add an edgy look to my nails. I get so many compliment while i wear them and they are so easy to apply. They are so inexpensive and the shipping was fairly quick. I will definitely be repurchasing when i run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really recommend it for nail art beginners.</li>
    <li> I love these metal studs! The seller includes lots of variety so you have a different &amp;#34;studded&amp;#34; look every time!  I&#x27;ve used them already many times and if you apply them directly on the wet nail, they WILL NOT FALL OFF.  Make sure to top coat as well.  Enjoy!</li>

    <li> These are very good. It doesnt have that much but its srill a good buy. I ordered 2 and they have star hearts and squares</li>
    <li> i thought there would be more in it like the picture , there was random pink stars which i was confused by. there nice just wish there was more</li>
    <li> The Studs Are Very Pretty And Fit On My Nails But I Barely Got Any Studs. Wish I Got More But It Is A Great Product.</li>
    <li> I have yet to receive these in the mail yet but I cannot wait. Nothing like a little metal for some style.</li>
    <li> again my wifeloves these thanks</li>
    <li> i would rate 5 star but took forever too come but i like it came like picture and its really cute</li>
    <li> Great product, satisfactory shipping time. I&#x27;ve already used the bejeezes out of them. Exactly as pictured. My only annoyance was that the wheel they come in doesn&#x27;t seem to have a tight lid, which makes them all mixed up but it&#x27;s not like it was a permanent issue. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> They are perfect for my nails, it has a variation of designs and came the day they said not other order that last more than a month to come.</li>
    <li> I thought it would come with more studs, But good product for the price.</li>
    <li> As described. Perfect very cute!</li>
    <li> they give you a great amount for the price but they do take forever to arrive. but once you get them they are a great asset to ay nail design</li>
    <li> I disliked the fact that the wrong item was shipped to me, so I had to undergo the hassle of getting a refund, and emailing back and forth with the company. However, I liked that fact that the company was very understanding and willingly refunded me and are sending the correct item to me. So I am still waiting on that. I would recommend the product to anyone who enjoys doing nail art, it is very fun to experiment with new things. I am excited to try the studs out once I get them!!</li>
    <li> Good variety, fast shipping. The only thing is that I was expecting the heart shaped studs (as shown in pic) but I got a different shape instead. Other than that, Im very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I shopped around for a while before deciding on this nail jewel wheel. They came as pictured and with a nice selection. They also shipped very fast too!</li>
    <li> They seem to work, but some of the metallic ones seem to lose their color when removed with nail polish remover. I guess not too bad since they are just silver underneath.</li>
    <li> For $2 this item is very good. So far I&#x27;ve used only the silver but I love them. I paint my nails first then stick a gem on the last for about 5-7 days</li>
    <li> I love the variety of studs this pack has. However, I did notice that the gold color wears off after a couple of days. Also since this product is shipped from over seas it does take a few weeks for it to arrive to it&#x27;s final destination.</li>
    <li> The container was very small for 3 dollars but overall the product wasnt too bad. I hope this review helped.</li>
    <li> The look was what I was after, unfortunately even with super glue the nail charms did not stay on well at all.</li>
    <li> Shopped through many different nail studs online. This came as described nice varieties of shapes, sizes and gold, silver and some black finishes. The product did come from China, but I received it within 2 weeks of ordering.</li>
    <li> Great variety of shapes many possibilities!  Already used some and my nails and they looked pretty awesome! Perfect for the new nail art that&#x27;s popular right now.</li>
