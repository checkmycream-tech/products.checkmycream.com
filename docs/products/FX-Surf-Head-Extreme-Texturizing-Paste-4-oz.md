      <li>Not as good as I remember when traveling the states.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>THE HOLD IS FANTASTIC!!</li>
      <li>give it a try for sure!</li>
      <li>But it looks liked they have changed their formula.</li>
      <li>If I can&#x27;t find one, the in-between ones still work well, but I&#x27;ve always stayed away from ones that were too gooey, as I have my doubts that they can be as effective.</li>
      <li>It also seems to flake a lot, especially right when you put it in (see picture).</li>
      <li>Very strong hold...</li>
      <li>I THINK THIS PRODUCT IS DARN NEAR PERFECT!!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best men&#x27;s hair product I have used.</li>
      <li>i used to be able to easily find this at walgreens, target and bartell drug, but no luck!</li>
      <li>It gives an amazing hold without turning your hair to plastic and without leaving any flakes or residue, and it&#x27;s easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>I have really fine hair that is cut in a pixie cut, and the product I bought a year ago would hold my hair all day, no problem, with a nice matte finish, no flakes.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>IMHO its better than most of the fancy/big name hair product out there</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Used to love this product.</li>
      <li>and now it&#x27;s more like a pomade.</li>
      <li>there is no product in the world better than this one.</li>
      <li>This is some outstanding hair gel/paste.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but you will still be able to manipulate.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Who has time to think about whether your hair gel is going to clash with your favorite deodorant and cologne anyway??  </li>
      <li>I have been using Surf Head for years now and love it.</li>
      <li>I use to buy this at Walmart, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it.  </li>
      <li>Used to LOVE this stuff....</li>
      <li>Looks better as the day goes on&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Texture is more of a pomade than a paste.</li>
      <li>ok if that&#x27;s your goal.</li>
      <li>The best part is you only need a bit to get the job done</li>
      <li>Not optimal for Spiky or Faux Hawk style, maybe thin/fine hair would respond better.</li>
      <li>but as the song says, you better shop around.....</li>
      <li>Just okay.</li>
      <li>More sheen, but not terribly</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s even better-</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is no longer sold in most stores.  </li>
      <li>It washes out easily and has a pleasant, mild scent.</li>
      <li>It works best with dry hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> They must have changed the formula. I first bought this a couple months ago and it was fantastic. It held my fine hair in place all day and had a waxy feel that lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another tub last week and it seemed to be the same until an hour later my hair started to fall down and it felt like it dried out and made my hair sorta crispy and limp and started flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe I got a bad tub. I even looked at the ingredients comparing the labels from the old one to the newer one. The ingredients are in the same order and all there. The only difference was that the older one had 2 different addresses listed under the distributors and the newer one had one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking that I got a bad tub, I just bought another and tried it out. Same label as the newer one and same disappointing results. Just when I thought I found the perfect wax/paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to find a replacement quickly. Anyone know of a good bees wax based product that doesn&#x27;t dry out or flake like gel and has extreme hold?</li>
    <li> FX Surf Head definitely changed their formula. I bought three new tubs from different places just to make sure, and the paste from all three stiffens and flakes. Please change back your formula!</li>
    <li> I used to love this stuff, it held great. I have curly hair and it could even smooth it out with one combing, but I recently canceled my amazon subscription because the last 3 times I have gotten it it has been not as soft and causes it to dry out and flake really bad. Really disappointed because its all I used for the last couple years, and there isn&#x27;t anything as affordable out there that I know of.</li>
    <li> If I could give this 0 Stars I would.  I bought some over a year ago and loved it.  I have really fine hair that is cut in a pixie cut, and the product I bought a year ago would hold my hair all day, no problem, with a nice matte finish, no flakes.  I should have listened to all the people who said that FX had changed the formula.  My recent purchase of this product was unbelievably disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;The formula does not feel waxy anymore at all.  It feels slick and almost like you are putting lotion on your hair.  This does not even define layers on fine hair, much less hold texture for a full day.  I hate it, and will have to purchase another product to style my hair at all.</li>
    <li> holds the dew without feeling weighed down. Will have to wash hair really well to get it out but that&#x27;s just the nature of the beast. I am a huge believer in this brand</li>
    <li> Totally awesome if you want to look like you have dandruff!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best men&#x27;s hair product I have used. The hold is great and lasts all day. The smell is light. Easy to redo if necessary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now and have LOVED it, but just like the other recent comments the company changed their formula and it absolutely sucks.  After putting it in your hair it turns gritty, separates and you can&#x27;t even comb it out.  Looks like someone dropped white flakes everywhere in your hair.  I had to rewash it this morning then threw the whole tub in the garbage which is totally disappointing.  If representatives from the company read these at all, PLEASE go back to the old formula, it was perfect then.  Until then, I won&#x27;t recommend this or purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I used to really like this product. It was stiff and waxy, but when you scrubbed it into your hair the thing worked miracles. I&#x27;ve been using it for a whole year and have never had a bad hair day with it. However, last month I bought it and the product had changed drastically. It was no longer stiff and waxy, but rather pasty, like the texture of tooth paste rather than the texture of stiff shoe polish. It no longer leaves my hair in messy textured clumps like I used to love, but fluffy and stupid looking. I&#x27;m so disappointed and let down by the only men&#x27;s hair product on the market I liked that I&#x27;m not even going to finish the can. I&#x27;ve been looking around at different products on the market but so far have not found anything as good as this product used to be.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using fx surfs head for at least the last 3 years and I absolutely loved it. It does everything I wanted/needed and the price was great. At one point I saw walmart stop carrying it so I got my brother who works at walgreens to order me 10 tubs before they also took it off their shelves. Once I worked my way through all that supply, I went ahead and found that Amazon also sells it for cheaper so I purchased 8 tubs. Again, I&#x27;m a happy guy with great hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, at the end of October, I start to run low again and I re-order 8 tubs from amazon just like before only this time the paste is not so waxy and noticeably harder. I check all 8 thinking I got a bad tub at first, but lo and behold, they are all exactly the same. I go to use some thinking it won&#x27;t matter and even just putting it in my hair I can see that the formula is not the same. I go to try and comb it through and style my hair and suddenly it&#x27;s like snowing on my head with all these white flakes. The same results every time. I go to try and return the remaining 7 tubs to amazon only to find out I can&#x27;t. So basically have 8 green and blue paper weights under my bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went one step further and tried to see if I could contact the company but I didn&#x27;t find and contact info for them. I take both a new and old tub and compare the ingredients and they are identical. The only difference was the address where they are no manufactured has changed. Can&#x27;t help be feel disappointed because I&#x27;m out the money I spent and now I need to find a replacement product (which thus far has been unsuccessful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say, stay away until they change things back..</li>
    <li> Best texturizing paste I&#x27;ve used.  Doesn&#x27;t look greasy and easily looks like just got done surfing.  Great for middle length hair.</li>
    <li> Used to LOVE this stuff....but since October, they have destroyed a great product.  The paste dries your hair up now, and then it starts to flake horrendously.  My haircutter used to recommend to all his clients, but has told me everyone now hates it.  I don&#x27;t know what these morons did to the original formula, but they need to rectify it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It gives an amazing hold without turning your hair to plastic and without leaving any flakes or residue, and it&#x27;s easy to wash out. I&#x27;ll admit the smell isn&#x27;t perfect, but it isn&#x27;t terrible or overpowering either (my wife doesn&#x27;t even notice it). However there are things I&#x27;ve noticed about the product that may be causing some bad reviews. The first thing is that this product does not work well at all when put on wet hair. Your hair must be dry for it to work effectively. The second thing is that I&#x27;ve noticed that not every jar is equal. Some have a rather dryish paste, some have a very gooey paste, and some are somewhere in between. I always take off the lid and look for a dry one. If I can&#x27;t find one, the in-between ones still work well, but I&#x27;ve always stayed away from ones that were too gooey, as I have my doubts that they can be as effective.</li>
    <li> This was NOT the consistency I am used to for this product.  It was too watery.&lt;br /&gt;I threw it in the trash :(</li>
    <li> This hair Paste in great, GREAT, Great!! The feel or texture of the paste is a medium thick, stiff cream, it works great on smoothing edges on hair line or shaping a style. The smell is great, a mellow fruity smell. not a strong smell at all. it fights frizz really well. THE HOLD IS FANTASTIC!! it doesnt dry out hair infact it makes my hair feel softer and moisturized but it still has the strong hold. it doesnt make ur hair crispy at all.    A little goes a long way. u only have to apply a small amount to hair strands. one container lasts me about 2 months. the price is great.it is easy to wash out. I THINK THIS PRODUCT IS DARN NEAR PERFECT!! Please dont stop selling it.     I am a african-american women with naturally curly hair that tends to frizz and curl or puff up easily with only a dash of humidity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for quite a while at the recommendation of a good friend.  All day hold, no gunky feeling, does not get hard.  It feels like a thick cream and goes into hair just fine.  Can be used for a soft spikey look, faux hawk, or any style where a pomade would be used.</li>
    <li> This provides that &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been to the beach look&amp;#34; with out weighing hair down or looking greasy or dirty.  Adds volume and control but you will still be able to manipulate.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> very very stiff, hard to pull through hair (kinda hurts) but definitely gives texture. I found that within an hour or two the hold was pretty much gone and my hair was smooth again. It also seems to flake a lot, especially right when you put it in (see picture).</li>
    <li> This products sucks!! This not what I bought Previous they change the indgredents or something because the hold is herendous.</li>
    <li> sticky and pasty and makes my hair greasy- ok if that&#x27;s your goal. but it smells GREAT.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect.</li>
    <li> Usually you get what you pay for, but this stuff is great.  Not greasy or too gluey.  Just right.  Good hold, nice fragrance.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for almost 2 years now. I have bought it multiple times and I will continue to do so. Although it doesn&#x27;t offer the same hold as gel or hairspray it does keep your hair in the style that you want and it keeps your hair looking and feeling natural and not gunky or moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I wear my hair with a slight part and pushed to the side.)</li>
    <li> i order the surf head but i never received it i call the company 4 times but never get it .</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have short, curly hair and this takes it well.  It smooths the frizzies too.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very strong hold... a little goes a LONG way. Incredible value. Performs as well as similar hair products costing several times more. And this is a big container!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve changed this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was so dissapointed! This version of surf head sucks! Why would you guys change the formula?!?!? This new stuff if terrible and will never use again way to lose loyal customers! I wish I could give 0 stars</li>
    <li> Horrible, they changed the formula.&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair look dry and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;my previous review is below but now it sucks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;&#x27;Great hold and washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;I use a little sporting wave on the top and sides of my head and use&lt;br /&gt;Surf Head to make the front of my hair stand up.&lt;br /&gt;I have a cow-lick and this stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt fall apart or get greasy in hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;Washes out easy with shampoo.&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> Good hold without being too stiff, seems to last throughout the day.  Very little product required, even for my fairly long and thick hair, so the can lasts for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> This is some outstanding hair gel/paste.  I use it all the time, my favorite so far--based on a decade of using different hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this until the four remaining hairs I have are gone.</li>
    <li> nice faint smell, great product.  one of these lasted me 6 months...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so happy i made the switch from hair gel to this product.  highly recommend it for all</li>
    <li> At first when i received this product I expected the consistency to be more... stable I guess. Its a bit more mushy and loose than the Texture Dirt, but sure enough I used a little bit in my hair, and it did the job I was looking for. Looks completely natural, I&#x27;m a dude and it gives me that natural beachy look with my short hair. Like I put nothing in it.</li>
    <li> Great hair paste.  Has hold without the flakiness of gel.  So you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting dusty-looking hair after you&#x27;ve gone through a day.  It lasts pretty well and doesn&#x27;t have the same heavy, greasy feel of pomade.  And the price is excellent for the amount you get per container.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Surf Head for well over 3 years, without any complaints. But it looks liked they have changed their formula. It now dries and flakes. So if you want it to look like you have dandruff, then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It has an amazing hold on my thick hair. Having short hair can be a disaster without the right products! Started using a few years ago. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores. Price is awesome. Will continue to purchase as needed.</li>
    <li> As far as pastes go, I would consider this a very light one.  You have to use considerably more to achieve strong hold, and restyling usually requires the addition of more product.  Has a pretty fresh scent and very light hold.  It&#x27;s a good product for summer heat and humidity - it&#x27;ll keep your hair messy but manageable, and when you start to sweat you don&#x27;t have to worry about it running down your face.  All in all, not bad.</li>
    <li> I really really like this stuff ... I put it in my medium cut hair and I look like a rockstar Lol well ill like to think that!</li>
    <li> Works amazing, dont leave it open or it dries out perty bad.</li>
    <li> The product has been modified. It now leaves hair very oily and flakes. Will no longer buy.</li>
    <li> The one I got was good but the next one I ordered seemed like they changed the formula. It started flaking.</li>
    <li> It was a mistake buying this product. It&#x27;s super greasy and doesn&#x27;t hold very well. I used it once and that was enough. Maybe others might like it, but for me, it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal stuff for keeping your hair in place with good volume while not putting a heavy shine on your hair.  Washes out easily and does not feel greasy.  IMHO its better than most of the fancy/big name hair product out there</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  I had picked up a can of this a while ago to try.  I loved it. It worked great.  However, after ordering a second one, I realized they changed their formula.  This resulted in a completely different texture and hold.  It used to be a paste and now it&#x27;s more like a pomade. If you have flat hair like I do and you are looking for a good hold, this will not do it.  At least not anymore.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has just enough hold for me to do whatever I want with my hair.  Weather it be a solid style or something a little more playful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and loved it. I never used anything else on my hair. But in the fall of 2014 the company changed the formula and now it&#x27;s a terrible hair product. I threw 5 new tubs in the trash. Do not waste your time with this product</li>
    <li> Used to be my favorite hair product, not I refuse to buy due to the formula change and have been looking into other products. Please change the formula back FX! Even if you want to use the current formula on a new product and revert this one back to the old formula that would be fine, but you&#x27;re losing business and your reputation with the formula change!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is not greasy, not sticky, but does the job. It is good to my hair and my pocketbook.</li>
    <li> Luv this product..best product for my thin brown hair&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to style bed head LooK...&lt;br /&gt;This white paste..does it pretty well..&lt;br /&gt;You need less...and has a little matte finish...&lt;br /&gt;Just what I need!&lt;br /&gt;WiL order again!</li>
    <li> THIS IS ... the closet thing to the old loreal surf hair from the early mid 2000&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like it, feels like it and even smells like it the old formula.  The most important part... it holds and has the matte effect exactly like the old formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent tons of money looking for a replacement since L&#x27;Oreal changed their formula.  It took almost two years and this product is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know their are online petitions for loreal to bring the old formula back.  This product is cheap and they give you tons of it ... give it a try for sure!</li>
    <li> They changed the formula to some cheap dollar store paste. Flakes like crazy and too hard to style hair. Its like elmers glue in your hair, except it breaks apart to flakes in an hour. Upset I bough 6 of these. All going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY disappointed in this company as I was a very loyal customer to this product.</li>
    <li> I thought I was the only crazy one who thought this stuff was amazing until I came on Amazon because my local CVS was out. This stuff is AWESOME! I am one of those guys who has always had some sort of hair product, gel, paste, glu, etc. but this is the only stuff I will use from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most products, this gives me just the right amount of hold for my wavy (when long curly-ish) hair without it being stiff or flaking halfway through the day. The best part is you only need a bit to get the job done and it actually looks better as the day goes on and it becomes more natural. I&#x27;ve gotten 2 of my friends hooked on this stuff and I&#x27;m spreading the gospel because I want this stuff to be around forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Everything&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- Looks better as the day goes on&lt;br /&gt;- Not much needed&lt;br /&gt;- Does not give you &amp;#34;gel head&amp;#34; but keeps its shape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Umm...ugly packaging?</li>
    <li> I have been using Surf Head for years now and love it. It is a non-crunchy and moldable paste that gives your hair texture to the max. It washes out easily and has a pleasant, mild scent. Its hard to find sometimes. I have seen it at Walgreens from time to time... thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> best styling paste for hair. its light and can make your hair go in different ways you want it . ive tried everything and this seems to hold up the best</li>
    <li> The formula has definitely changed from what was my go-to product for years. This new formula is awful. Leaves hair stiff and glossy. The worst part is that if hair is so much as touched after application it flakes terribly. Previous product was excellent with a controlled matte finish. Hoping this change is a bad batch or exclusive to this distributor. Will try to purchase locally.    ADDED 1/13/15 - This product works as a good alternative to the crap fx is selling now: [[ASIN:B002N5MI2S TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax, 2.65 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and I&#x27;ve tried a boatload of different hair products.&lt;br /&gt;I like a medium hold and high shine and this fits the bill - it won&#x27;t dry up rock hard like some will.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on best when your hair is still a bit wet from the shower.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to find at times, so stock up when you see a good deal!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product!</li>
    <li> Just okay. Works to keep hair in place, but not necessarily what I was wanting.  Not optimal for Spiky or Faux Hawk style, maybe thin/fine hair would respond better. Texture is more of a pomade than a paste. Good size &amp; lots of product though.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband and he uses it everyday.  He loves it and I buy in bulk usually.</li>
    <li> This is still more hair-gelly than other texturizing products I&#x27;ve used (Jonathan Dirt &amp; Sebastian) but gives more control. Equally long-lasting hold. More sheen, but not terribly so.&lt;br /&gt;If you want the 100% natural unwashed-hair look  I&#x27;d recommend the products above, this surf head falls somewhere in btw those and regular hair gels</li>
    <li> Use it every day, great product</li>
    <li> Having shortish hair, I&#x27;m hard pressed to find styling gel that&#x27;s thick enough to keep the shortest parts down while light enough to let me spike it and make it messy on top. This stuff fits the bill perfectly. It&#x27;s so easy to use that I sometimes forget to get a haircut for an extra week or two since I can make my hair look exactly as I want even when it gets too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also &amp;#34;revive&amp;#34; a look with a little water (great for a long flight since you sometimes can&#x27;t take gels/ liquids on the plane with you).</li>
    <li> I randomly aquired this product from a friend of a friend. Once I tried this product, I do not want any other product for my hair. I have thick semi curly hair that normal gel lasts only hours in or makes my head a rock. Damp hair and a small amount is all I need for at least 8 hrs. If I go out I put a little more in and the consistency is the same but lasts longer. Best hair product ever tried, hands down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products over the years, and I like this one the best.  Holds my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t turn flakey later in the day</li>
    <li> Been using this for 2 year! Great value for a quality product. Much cheaper on Amazon than at my local drugstore. Great all day hold for my short spiky hair. The smell can be a little strong but it goes away.</li>
    <li> All this did was make my hair oily and waxy. I was looking for a product like crew fiber, but cheaper, so I&#x27;ve been sampling a lot of different products and this was one of the worst, definitely a waste of money. It didn&#x27;t create any texture, didn&#x27;t hold, and simply gave my hair a greasy sheen to it.</li>
    <li> Best mens hair product available. Its the perfect texture and isnt greasy. It lasts all day and allows you to manipulate your hair in any way.</li>
    <li> First bought this in 2011. I don&#x27;t use anything else since. That little tub goes a long way. In my opinion ,for best results, apply after you shower(while hair is damp).</li>
    <li> I use to buy this at Walmart, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it.  I tried other products in the mean time and have regretted buying any of them.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this hair product. We had tried all other kinds and none had the hold he wanted and always left his hair feeling greasy. This is the best kind I have found and always keep it stocked up in our house now. Also a little goes a long way, and it lasts a long time! great product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy, used to give this five stars but the formula has changed and now it flakes everywhere!</li>
    <li> This is very thick and a little goes a long way. I like that it actually holds my hair in place all day and isn&#x27;t super sticky once it is on my hair. I have not had any flaking or other issues and it adds volume and texture. Definitely a good buy. I don&#x27;t think it would hold really wild styles but it gives me the piecey, shaggy look I want. It also adds shine!</li>
    <li> Extremely good. I am from Brazil e there is no product in the world better than this one. Really good.</li>
    <li> This is the very best hair paste I have come across.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product all the time and it was awesome then I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. So amazon here I am. The 3 pack I was sent smelt the same but the consistency and texture of the product was not the same that I used to purchase in store. This version was hard, dryer and just plain different. It makes my hair automaticly flake up and does not hold and style like it should. I used it twice and just threw away all 3 cans. Waste of money because this is not the same surfhead I used a year or so ago.</li>
    <li> pretty cheap and keeps my hair up for the 12 hours at work.</li>
    <li> I am a woman that likes to have my hair short and spikey....I asked a male friend of mine what he uses to spike up his hair (and he REALLY spikes it) and he suggested this.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of high dollar products and this one works just as well, if not better than the rest.  This small tub last a long  time.  I also like to add a small amount to my wet hair and then add more when it dries to shape it.  Than seems to work better than just using it on the dry hair for the final style.  Try it!  Haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;new\\&quot; version everyone has commented on.  Hopefully, it still works, because it&#x27;s almost time for a new tub!!!&lt;br /&gt;UPdated:  I agree with the others that said the product formula has changed and it doesn&#x27;t work like it used to.  I now use [[ASIN:B007KA804Q Got2b Chaotic Restyler Fiber Gum, 2.0 Ounce]] This now is my go to product for styling my short hair to spike it up.</li>
    <li> I use this gel with a small amount of pomade to keep my hair in place, but still soft. It works just as well as the $15 bottles from other brands (which are way smaller) so definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> This is the product I always buy. Good balance of being strong but not too stiff. Also available in Walmart stores by the way.</li>
    <li> Tired of overpaying for stuff that just holds your hair in place, guys?  In my opinion, this stuff is the perfect answer.  The fragrance is fine; enough to know you used product, but not overpowering.  Who has time to think about whether your hair gel is going to clash with your favorite deodorant and cologne anyway??  And instead of paying $15-16 for a little jar, you get 4 oz. for only about $5.  Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Walgreens near me stopped carrying this product. Order was on time, price was good and I will re-order it again when my supply gets low. Great hair product!</li>
    <li> After trialing many products, this is the one that works best for me.  I wish they still sold it in a 3-pack!</li>
    <li> i used to be able to easily find this at walgreens, target and bartell drug, but no luck! i have extremely thick black hair that is a nightmare to style, especially when i decide to grow it out a little. this product does a great job of getting things just right without leaving a gooey mess or sticky/shiny residue (feels more waxy after applying). i also like the fact that the product seems to stay in my hair after a good workout, instead of being washed out by my natural sweat and oils (tmi?). i would note that if you want a sculpted look that this is not the product for you. i mainly use this for getting a slightly messy but clean natural style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i took off one star since the old formula (from 5 or so years ago) was a lot better, in my opinion. surf head used to be extremely solid (like chipping off wax from a candle), but after working it in your hands for a bit, it would turn into some sort of magical hair paste.</li>
    <li> I basically alternate between three primary hair products (all FX):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture Dirt&lt;br /&gt;Molding Wax&lt;br /&gt;Surf Head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surf head is the most &#x27;hard hold&#x27; of the three (the order of the list above is really in least to most). It&#x27;s good for longer hair or more intense styling. It gets better as the day goes on, too, going from being a little crispy and helmet-like, to actually seeming more natural in hair. Even though it has the most hold of the three, it is still much, much more natural than traditional gel, and I would definitely recommend it over that in terms of being usable in professional settings, etc.</li>
    <li> Everyone is going to want a certain amount of hold and sheen. I&#x27;ve tried several products and for me, this is exactly the right amount of hold and sheen I was looking for.  Very inexpensive compared to other brands that do the same, and that I didn&#x27;t like as much.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.... holds my hair in semi-spiky styles and gives it lots of texture and body.  I like that it has minimal scent as well.  One little tub will last you a long time.  However when I first purchased this from Amazon (sold by Amazon, not a different seller) it was just shy of $5.  Now it&#x27;s more than double that.  Tip:  It&#x27;s still the cheaper price on Wal-Mart.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product but as the song says, you better shop around.....</li>
    <li> I just recently cut my extremely wavy, long [just below midback] hair to a pixie cut and needed some product to keep it from frizzing and misshaping too much, and this did the trick! Super glad that I bought it.. it does just what I wanted.. no super stiff nastiness.. pliable but durable, and with my thick, wild mane, it does just the trick.. just about a dime size is needed to do the trick, for all day support. [for me, anyway.] reapply as necessary.. everyone&#x27;s hair is different. Will definitely re-buy once I am out.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I remember when traveling the states. Still a good product but dries my hair out and creates dreds.</li>
    <li> Paste works great for holding hair shape without stickiness or wet look.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff here, gel/putty/hairspray is a personal choice but this is exactly what I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for a quick messy look...only issue is sometimes it leaves little white clumps of paste in your hair</li>
    <li> I have thick Asian hair, and this stuff works great. Not too strong but still holds. If you want the slept in look, go for it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is no longer sold in most stores.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It holds very well and one tub will last me months, but not that soft at all.  If it was softer to touch then I would have given this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have been using it for about three years now. I have a hair cut that is long on top and short on the sides (think David Beckham). It does not leave it crunchy like gel, but firms up enough to hold the style. It has a very mild sweet smell.</li>
    <li> Used to love this product. Until they changed the formula. Now it&#x27;s dry doesn&#x27;t hold like it did before. Leaves flakes!</li>
    <li> This product seems to have changed recently to become stickier and thicker than before, for me it is less easy to work with and more pasty residue in my hair. I had become very used to this product and hope this is an anomaly but if this is a permanent change, I made need to switch to something else.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my type of hair.  I have really short straight hair that I can&#x27;t do much with.  I finally found stuff to get my hair to do what I want and that is this surf head paste.  It works best with dry hair.  Or aleast in my case it does.</li>
    <li> Best paste ever.  Not sure why people spend so much on other brands.</li>
    <li> There is nothing better on the store shelves for afro American hair but Surf! I always buy 3 to 4 jars at a time.</li>
    <li> The Surf Head Extreme texturizing paste does exceptionally well in styling hair. I bought my first bottle at CVS and decided to style my hair today (2/9/2013) which was the day after Nemo hit the northeast. I applied a quarter size to my hair and styled it into a quiff and throughout the day, it kept its shape. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s even better- I went to the gym on the same day and even after I slightly broke a sweat, the paste still kept my quiff. The paste gives my hair a natural look to it and im pretty sure that i&#x27;m going to throw out my bottle of hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If you&#x27;re in a budget, such as myself, the surf head extreme texturizing paste is definitely the way to go!</li>
    <li> So glad I can find this product on the Internet as I am not able to find it locally in any stores anymore</li>
</ol>
