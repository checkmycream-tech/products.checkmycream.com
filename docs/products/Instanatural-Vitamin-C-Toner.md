<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Awesome Toner, my girlfriend loved this product as a gift and uses it every day. She has noticed a huge improvement, her face is much tighter and healthier because of this product.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Really good spray. Waiting to see if it has any problems but i like it so far.  A little weird smelling.</li>
    <li> At first thought it was a little strange that it comes in a spray bottle but i am loving that now for two reasons. Less waste and no spills. You can spray it directly on a cotton ball or cloth and sometimes i just spray it directly on my face. My skin is less prone too breakouts and my pores are smaller. It also has a great citrus smell. I did receive this product free for review but as you can see from my other reviews that does not guarantee a positive review.</li>
    <li> love the smell and how my skin fills</li>
    <li> This facial toner it the best. I HAD uneven skin tone lots of dark spots. Since I&#x27;ve been using this toner my face is clearing up. Planning on purchasing again!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this toner and will by again. Ive been using it since December and it is now April and I can tell that my pores are smaller and the darker sunspots I had on my forehead are gone. The smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as some of the reviewers stated but its not bad at all and fades pretty quickly. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I initially ordered this facial toner as I was ordering some Oz Naturals serums.  I thought the toner was also Oz Naturals and when I received the order I realized my &amp;#34;mistake&amp;#34;.  Wow am I glad I ordered this toner.  Their suggestion to put it in your fridge to use as a cool morning mist wakeup for your face is genius.  It feels great, it smells great, and my skin loves it!!!  Thanks InstaNaturals!</li>
    <li> It worked out very good, smells a bit werid. The thing is that I don&#x27;t know it was only me or everyone has the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;When I spray, it doesn&#x27;t really cover the area it&#x27;s supposed to cover. Feels like something has stuck in the holes of the nob</li>
    <li> it is a nice serum .. goes well with my skin and is easy to spray . I feel as if i did not apply anything on my face..cool!!</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of using, I have noticed my pores are smaller.  This has improved the complexion of the skin on my face.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try and review the Vitamin C facial toner.  The Facial Toner is the perfect way to tone and hydrate your skin. It left my face feeling refreshed and clean! Along with vitamin C, it also has sulfur which helps increase elasticity in the face. the other and my favorite ingredient is witch hazel which works as a purifier for the skin and pores and also reduces the size and appearance of the pores. This toner works as an all in one hydrator, I use it at least 2 times a day to keep my face feeling refreshed!  The is the perfect staple to add to your daily beauty routine!</li>
    <li> Love this toner! Skin feels bright and fresh after applying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving all the the products in this line a try... So far I am extremely happy.... It&#x27;s the same quality product as $150 bottle items for a tenth of the price... I will continue too purchase</li>
    <li> I received a coupon for this product and purchased it a couple of weeks ago. I&#x27;ve been testing vitamin C skincare products because I really wanted to know what the hype is all about. So far the ones I&#x27;ve tried, including this one are pretty good! I like the OZ Natural Mineral toner I used before this, and this is just as good. Maybe a bit better because I can actually feel my skin tightening/firming up a bit once I pat my skin dry. I also spray it on my neck and chest. If you don&#x27;t wear makeup during the day, it is a great little refresher. Just make sure not to get this in your eyes.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Makes your face feel very soft and balances out your color.</li>
    <li> Easy to use as it is a spray. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> When I received this I was reading the directions and it said to SPRAY on face and was reluctant to do so,  basically afraid of it getting in my eyes.  I did spray it on and just used cotton pad to wipe my eyes and lips.  Love the way it feels after putting it on,  it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tight or dry and also use the moisturizer with it and am pleased with the combination...would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful and refreshing spray! It&#x27;s is natural and works well to tone my skin and keep it fresh! Love this!</li>
    <li> I do like that it comes in a spray.  Easy to apply and can use as a quick refresher when needed.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Great toner for skin that needs a boost.</li>
    <li> I love this spray toner!  I spritz my clean face with it, then use my serum.  I can&#x27;t even FIND any pores on my face with this! Really do like the addition of the Vitamin C product to my daily lineup.</li>
    <li> I have had for 1 month. I like it. No change noted in my skin.</li>
    <li> Strange scent to this product but does feel quite refreshing when applied to face.</li>
    <li> The toner was great! It smells like oranges and dries on my skin so well. it makes my pores smaller, so when I apply my makeup, it looks a lot better.</li>
    <li> This is really refreshing and non-irritating.</li>
    <li> After cleansing I spritz this all natural/organic toner over my face and neck! I love that it contains tea tree which is known to kill germs! It&#x27;s very refreshing and smells fresh, makes me feel clean! I follow with my InstaNatural&#x27;s Serum and Moisturizer and they get absorbed much quicker than before! You also only need to spritz a little or you&#x27;ll end up wiping a lot off! My pores have tightened up from the witch hazel and tea tree, and it&#x27;s also tightened my skin, therefore firming my aging skin and giving me a completely brighter look! I was always very self conscious of the large pores on my nose...not anymore!! I even use it at bedtime as part of my night time ritual. I love InstaNatural! I&#x27;ve tried so many expensive products and finally.....a product that works and they last so I&#x27;m not needing to be constantly buying. Their products that I have used all go a long way. I won&#x27;t use anything else now that I&#x27;ve found these! Thanks InstaNatural for making great products that work and are reasonably priced! All skin types can benefit by this!</li>
    <li> I just started using the toner a few weeks ago and find the it leaves a very refreshing feeling on my skin.  I then follow it with the Vitamin C Serum.  I have great hopes that I will start to have younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this vitamin c toner. The last few year I have been fighting with me face. This has made a huge difference.  It has significantly shrunken my pores. I recomend this product and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> This facial toner seems to make the skin appear to feel a little smoother after use but overall I would say that I did not see any significant results that would make me want to continue to purchase this product.  Their are a lot of these types of products on the market and a lot of them will show a longer lasting effect.</li>
    <li> It has been a good product, it is cree oil so let your skin natura and fresh, the best way of use is having the toner un the fridge for a cooler sensation.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Vitamin C is facial products, I get super dry skin in the winter.  Vitamin C is the one product that makes my skin without making it overly oily.  I don&#x27;t review beauty products much because I never really know what to say so I asked my sister what she thought and what she considers when buying something like this.&lt;br /&gt;She told me price, smell, does it work and is there any side effect like greasy skin ect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:&lt;br /&gt;So lets cover price on amazon it is normally 44.95 which to me is WAY to high, but right now you can get it on sale for 19.95 which I think is a great price.  The bottle is 4 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell:&lt;br /&gt;It had no harsh chemical smell and there was a really sweet light citrus smell.  So if you are like me and like the smell of citrus its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work:&lt;br /&gt;I am going to answer this on 2 levels.  First lets cover the spraying, I like that its a fine mist so I don&#x27;t end up with a huge splash in the middle of my face.  I also like the fact it a large mist so it only takes 2 sprays to cover my face.&lt;br /&gt;Now let talk about if it works on your skin.  I have only been using a few days and I can tell a difference.  My skin feels a bit tighter and a lot smoother.  My winter time dry skin didn&#x27;t start yet, but I have a feeling when it does that the Vitamin C facial toner will handle it with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side effect:&lt;br /&gt;No that I have notice as of yet.  There is no left over greasy smell, no horrible smell and no break outs.  Over all its a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto my issues.  The only issue I had with the product was shipping.  It did seem to open a bit when being shipped and spilled out into the envelope.  Not much, but I did have to wipe down the product.&lt;br /&gt;I was given this products for review.  All opinions are my own</li>
    <li> After my first few uses, I did start to see my pores were clearing up and reducing in size. The Witch Hazel and Tea Tree Oil combination tightens, extracts, and purifies without burning or over-drying the skin. The Vitamin C also helped to even out my skin tone and restored my skin’s vibrancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received free for review purposes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments after using this product just for a few days. A week later I bought an extra bottle just so I don&#x27;t run out. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My skin glows after I use it. I am picky also and this is very&lt;br /&gt;Good!</li>
    <li> I love this toner. It has made a big difference on my face.</li>
    <li> Let me first say, I have extremely sensitive skin, oily, and dry in the winter, and acne prone. This stuff works great for me! It doesn&#x27;t dry me out or make me oily.  It makes my skin look great! I use it after washing my face in the morning. Great if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Smells so refeshing! I love this toner out of all that I&#x27;ve tried. I would buy this over the very expensive ones that cost over $50.</li>
    <li> I am  rating  this  a five  because  it&#x27;s a great price,  arrived quickly, the product  itself  is refreshing and I love the spray. It&#x27;s  light  and  absorbs  nicely  and does clean the dirt that my cleanser missed. It works  great and the  customer service also  awesome.  I received  an email just  to check in on if I was satisfied and an offer to refund my money if I weren&#x27;t and keep the bottle. They were  sincere  with wanting to make sure you are satisfied.  And that&#x27;s  5 ☆☆☆☆☆</li>
    <li> This stuff is really incredible. I have really sensitive skin and have wasted a lot of money on facial care products. This does not dry out my skin and leaves an after glow. I&#x27;m anxious to try the other products made by this company.</li>
    <li> V. Nice and have a good smell, good refresh spray to use during work.</li>
    <li> Over all, I love what the  Vitamin C Toner have done for my skin. It felt wonderful and the citrus smell was also very nice. As it was starting to dry, I felt my face tighten up fast. It didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin which I was happy about because I love this product so much.The Vitamin C Toner helped shrink down my pores and is such the great pick me up for the skin through out the day which made my skin feel more clean.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C Facial Toner. It makes my skin feel so smooth and I love how there&#x27;s no sticky feeling or odor after using it. I&#x27;m in love with it and if and when I run out, I will order more. I&#x27;m so happy I was able to get this through Tomoson and they let me try this for free. I use it everyday and love it.  I love that it&#x27;s 100% organic and helps it aging. I&#x27;m not too old yet but I love it.</li>
    <li> So just recently, I discovered the Oil Cleansing Method. So I only wash my face at night and refresh with this in the morning. I love it, I haven&#x27;t seen my skin look so good. it is pricey! But it works well. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is great for reducing the appearance of large pores.  I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product! High quality, scent free, really makes my skin glow. I&#x27;ve used many facial elixirs, this is one of the best! I&#x27;m a customer for life &amp; have recommended to friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> Love it, tone my skin</li>
    <li> First of all, I have never seen Vitamin C in spray form before. The spray bottle is convenient, fast, and fresh. Vitamin C is a must on aging skin. I keep it out so I can spritz my face real fast when I walk by. It smells nice and citrus-Y. It also contains witch hazel and aloe vera. Nice toner- prepper before moisturizer and makeup. Is organic and natural, cruelty-free and made in the USA . I think men would also like the refreshing application too. I received a complimentary bottle from BrandBacker to try out and review.</li>
    <li> This is the 1st toner I&#x27;ve had that makes my face feel cool &amp; refreshing.  It completely hydrates my face!</li>
    <li> Love this toner. Was nervous to spray near my eyes but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. Has shrunk my pore size and is overall a very quality toner. Luv that it is not tested on animals. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in the market for a good toner for a long time now, and I stumb upon the Insta Naturals brand a couple months ago, and have loved everything they formulate! This product is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;I love the citrusy smell! The bottle is a spray nozzle type, which makes applying this toner so easy and quick! It makes me wonder how all of the other toner manufacturers have never thought to do this! If you decant anything into a spray bottle, it lasts so much longer than if you just dabbed a cotton ball in the liquid. So, my frugal side appreciates this packaging!&lt;br /&gt;The toner itself has helped to tighten my pores, and hydrate my face, even though we are still knee deep in snow, and our heat is at maximum. I&#x27;m crediting this toner to keeping my face balanced and my pores small!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a very humid summer and I&#x27;m a sucker for vitamin C skin care. I&#x27;ve been spritzing this on my face and neck the past few days and am finding it extremely refreshing. My skin firms up pores shrink noticeably for at least several hours. Keeping it in the refrigerator feels amazing on these hot and humid days. The scent is like citrus and aloe. I received this at a large discount but was not required to review. I&#x27;m quite pleased. I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars at this point as I have only used it a few days thus far.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I enjoy the smell of oranges and the cool feeling on the face.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Have seen a big dfiference yet, but have only been using it a week. Think it is as described though.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and it is as described ..I&#x27;m excited to use it :) &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I really love this  toner,  it&#x27;s very  refresher, and feel good on the skin. It gives my skin a nice  glow. I have been  using thi for 2 weeks, and could be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks  you  instanatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wa given an opportunity to  try this with  discount. My opinion is all mind -  honest and  unbiased.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Nice and light</li>
    <li> Great product, my skin feels refreshed every time I use this product</li>
    <li> I like the way my face feels after this toner. I don&#x27;t love the smell but that&#x27;s just me. Good product</li>
    <li> My pores are actually visibly smaller, which is a huge deal .This toner contains powerful astringents like Witch Hazel and Tea Tree Oil, which purify your skin by cleaning and tightening pores, shrinking their appearance. I also have oily skin, and this toner works to combat and remove excess oil, while restoring your natural pH levels so your skin is balanced. It&#x27;s not just for oily-skinned people like me, though. It&#x27;s great for all skin types! This toner will make your face more receptive to absorbing serums, oils, and moisturizers applied after it. Make this toner a part of your daily beauty routine. You won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;I received this awesome toner for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Smells amazing and feels so good on my face!! And works wonders! AAA++++</li>
    <li> Love this! So refreshing and drys quickly.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Toner is great, lightweight and the fragrance is pleasing. After washing my face and then using the toner my face feel refreshed and tingly.  I have used it a week and my crater size pores are already getting smaller and the skin on my face is tighter and feels youthful.  I highly recommend this toner for all to use. I use it after wash, under moisturizer and anti age serum and foundation.  It has made a noticeable difference.please try!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this toner twice daily, love it! It feels great to spray on and helps the moisturizers work better.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different toners here on amazon, but this is the first and only to make an immediate difference. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I really love this toner and it works great but I do not like that it is a spray. So I poured it in a dif bottle so I can pour it onto a cotton ball and use it that way.</li>
    <li> This toner definitely makes my skin feel more alive and energized without giving a layer of residue or stickiness. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the product, so refreshing and smells amazing</li>
    <li> The toner smells pleasant. I may store it in the fridge as recommended for a refreshing mist. Toner is a little sticky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying your product for free for my review so far I&#x27;m not crazy about the spray or the smell but maybe that&#x27;s just me sorry</li>
    <li> I really love this product. The spritzing bottle that it comes in is a perfect size. It&#x27;s large enough to feel like it is worth the money, small enough to still fit comfortably in my hand. It sprays a nice, fine mist that dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light and citrusy and not medicinal at all. The first few times I used this it made my skin tingle. Honestly, I was a little worried because I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to drying. After a few days of using once daily I worked up to using this twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely feel the pore tightening action, and this hasn&#x27;t dried my skin at all. I use this with their retinol moisturizer (a little goes a long way) and I have noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin&#x27;s elasticity. Definitely a winning combination for me.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of this toner, big bottle that will last awhile and sprays perfect on your skin after cleansing. The natural, organic ingredients in this are wonderful just perfect for a toner and my skin feels so soft and hydrated after really prepares it for my instaNatural vitamin C serum, they go perfect together. This toner has a nice light scent and I plan on using it to spray on face in summer for pick me up!  I was given this product to try for small fee and I feel so lucky to have tried it. I will definitely buy more it&#x27;s the perfect toner for mr.</li>
    <li> This product has a stong smell to it that I am not fond of. It is a bit sticky as well. I think it is a decent toner but the smell needs to be &amp;#34;toned-down&amp;#34; a bit. I admit I am more sensitive to perfumes and additives than the average person may be so I am being critical when I speak on behalf of this product! The Vitamin C facial moisturizer though is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love this product. So refreshing on the skin and a great scent.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing for skin.... love the citrus smell too.&lt;br /&gt;great skin care product</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel fresh and soft after using</li>
    <li> Wonderful for helping pores to look smaller, skin feels soft and smooth. Just a couple pumps will cover your whole face. I love the light tingly feeling you get when it hits your skin! I use this along with the Vitamin C Moisturizer and the Vitamin C Anti-Aging and Skin Clearing Serum. I love this whole line of products and they all complement each other so well. As with the other two products the citrus scent is very light and pleasant. I recommend this and the other two products! Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Best toner I have used. After using toners, I&#x27;m usually left wondering if they actually do anything for my skin. However, after using this toner, I noticed almost immediate results. My skins feels cleaner and tighter and my pores are smaller because of this product. Also feels really refreshing.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural Vitamin C toner -  love this toner. I got it on a promotion and was kinda hesitant because I thought it would be too harsh as I was thinking straight Vitamin C and how acidic that can be but I was WRONG! I had been using Clinique after cleansing toner for quite a long time and I always felt it left my tight feeling really tight but just put up with it because it was one of the few toners I can use that does not break out my skin. One thing I have always had a problem with is my skin needs to kind of be in the sweet spot or it breaks out. Over moisturized i break out and if i go over cleansed or toners and the top gets tight or dry it will break out under the top layer - I know that sounds weird but what can I say. So I decided to give this toner a good try simply because I want to move away from chemicals and preservatives in all my skin care and cosmetic products.  I have tried and loved other InstaNatural products so I figured OK and I have so far not had a single breakout in several weeks of using it every night after my cream cleanser. My skin feels soft and deep cleaned after the toner, I then follow up with the Vitamin C Serum with Hyalauronic acid by InstaNatural which I love love. Good stuff and I like the way it smells too!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling clean and soft!</li>
    <li> Overall really  good product! I like the spray design very much also! The orange like smell may not for every one but other than this, it is great product.&lt;br /&gt;Why not 5 stars? Cuz I don&#x27;t give 5 stars unless I&#x27;m crazy about sth.</li>
    <li> Makes the skin feel soft!</li>
    <li> Due to coming off my birth control my hormones have been all kinds of crazy for the past 6 months.  Suddenly my face has been this disgusting oily, greasy, zitty mess and I could not for the life of me figure out how to get it to clear up.  Thankfully, my husband sent me for a facial for Valentine&#x27;s Day and the esthetician told me that my face was craving moisture.  I informed her that I had drastically increased my water intake and I was moisturizing my face twice a day.  She then suggested I get a Vitamin C Toner to add to my daily routine.  I purchased InstaNatural because the reviews were so great and I have to say they were not kidding.  I feel like myself again.  No more gross oil.  No more blemishes.  It worked so fast and was so easy to add to my routine!!!</li>
    <li> I have the oiliest skin in the world! I actually joke around with people that we could never have an oil shortage in this country because they could just come to me and I would donate. I don&#x27;t have cystic acne, or even severe acne, but I&#x27;ve been on Accutane twice just to try to control the oil, it&#x27;s that bad. I can&#x27;t even wear foundation because of it, it just slides right off my face. So I&#x27;m always looking for the worlds next best toner. I can&#x27;t use ones like Seabreeze or Neutrogena, or even plain witch hazel, because they&#x27;re so strong that they actually cause my skin to produce more oil. The two dermatologists who prescribed the Accutane have warned me about not using anything stronger than a gentle cleanser in order to avoid overstimulating my oil glands. So I was excited to see this toner had a lot of  nourishing ingredients but also a little nervous because of the witch hazel. But I ordered it anyway and decided to give it a try. I spritzed it on after washing with my normal moisturizing cleanser, and patted dry with a cotton ball like the directions say. There was no stinging or that really dry, pulling feeling that you get after a normal toner. In fact for a few seconds it  almost felt as if I had applied and extremely light moisturizer. It took about 90 seconds for it to be fully absorbed. The first time I applied it I waited for it to dry before applying my moisturizer, just to see what would happen, after that I followed the instructions and applied my moisturizer while my skin was still damp. I have to say I was a bit shocked to find that their claims were actually true. Something I have never found to be the case with any toner. From past experience I knew it wasn&#x27;t the witch hazel that was doing it and I didn&#x27;t think it was just a vitamin C because that is in my moisturizer as well, so I looked at the ingredients to find what could possibly be contributing to the success. This toner also contains Aloe Vera, Colloidal Silver, Lavender Distillate, Geranium Essential Oil, Grapefruit Seed, Rosemary Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Enzymatic Concentrate, Camu Camu Berry, Tamanu Oil, Noni, Lemon Essential Oil, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Chamomile Essential Oil, Wildcrafted Arnica, Tea Tree Essential Oil, Carrot Oil, and Vitamin E. An a Nurse Practitioner I know that we use dressings containing Colloidal Silver, Aloe Vera, Arnica and Vitamin E on some of the most severe wounds and burns, so I&#x27;m sure they have significant cellular rejuvenation properties and helped my skin tolerate the witch hazel. The Tea Tree is naturally very antibacterial.  But I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell you what ingredient on that amazing list, or what combination, is responsible for decreasing my skins oil production so dramatically. And in the end it really doesn&#x27;t matter to me which is responsible, as long as it keeps working. Because not only is my old production dramatically decreased but so is the size of my pores. Anyone with oily skin knows that it&#x27;s twin sister is incredibly large pores. They get so filled up with gunk that they stretch and then when you&#x27;re skin gets oilier as the day goes on the light shines off your skin making your pores appear even more prominent. Not an attractive combination. The longer you use this toner the more it cleans out your pores, the more they shrink, and the less oil you produce, the less the cycle feeds on itself. My pores have shrunk to that of the size of a normal person, which is a really big deal for me. The only other time I&#x27;ve been able to achieve this is while I have been taking Accutane, which dried me out so badly my lips actually cracked and bled, yet it was a price I was willing to pay to get rid of the oily skin. This is a far gentler, safer, superior solution. I feel like I want to write the manufacturer a thank you letter. I&#x27;ve never felt that way about anything in my life. I will be buying this product for as long as the company makes it.</li>
    <li> Just starting using this toner and have been really happy.  I really like the scent.  Kind of floral/citrus but really mild and fresh. I use it after cleansing and before using the retinol serum.  Tightens and refreshes and a great prep before the serum which is more of the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;.  I have also used it as a spritz to freshen my hair between shampooing (I tend to be dry not greasy) as the scent is really nice.  Really love this product as well as the great follow-up from InstaNatural&#x27;s with any questions or concerns that I might have.</li>
    <li> I love how this product smells. it smells like oranges, actually. It&#x27;s nice to put on because it glides on to skin so smoothly. It makes my face completely smooth and soft to the touch. Rather than brightening my skin, it actually keeps the shiny spots of my combination skin mattified so my complexion looks more even. Because of this, it&#x27;s great to use as a primer for foundation. I also like to use it to enhance my complexion on days when I don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, wonderful and one more time, wonderful product. So easy and comfortable to use! Big bottle, will last longer. Skin looks better, clean and toned. Much less imperfections. No sign of allergical reaction. Very pleased and would definately recommend.</li>
    <li> This does make my skin tingle and feel a bit fresher.  But when I purchased it, I was hoping it would make my pores smaller like the description boasted it would.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t even put a dent in the bigness of my pores. I have super oily skin with big pores on my nose. I spray it on after I wash my skin thoroughly but only when I want to get a little tingle.  Not because it makes my pores look any smaller.  Purchase for the tingle not for the pore reduction, if you decide to purchase at all...</li>
    <li> When I first tried it was like hmmm, it dries out matte and hydrates just right but not sure if recommended for dry skin. I love the citrus scent, which makes it feel more refreshing. I planned to use it only during hot summers as a refreshing spray. So after trying it for a few days I was like, this is a nice summer staple. BUT then I got sick last week and whenever I get sick with a cold, my face gets REALLY dry, like my throat, I get extremely dehydrated from trouble swallowing and my skin takes the toll first. So the whole of last week I had to refrain from washing my face with anything drying, and in the middle of the night or randomly during the day I would wake up to my skin being dry and itchy even after my regular facial routine. During one of the nights last weekend I decided to try this product, and I was impressed that it helped, it became a routine after blowing my nose (lol), or when I wake up in the morning. It is also great in winter for a quick refresh, It helped with the dryness and itchiness of my skin. I now keep it on my nightstand for a quick moisture to use at night before bed.  -Oreleona [Product provided for free for testing purposes]</li>
    <li> light and refreshing toner and a great pick me up throughout the day. I love the citrus scent!</li>
    <li> I checked my Amazon e-mails and saw that I was asked to give my input for this product. I didn&#x27;t want to disappoint for one simple reason: I like this product enough to order it a second time. I will probably keep ordering it. My only issue is in regards to the idea of toner itself, and not in this actual product. What is toner, truly? Is it necessary? For a man, probably not. For a woman, probably not. However, with the belief that I want to better myself and keep the aging process to a minimum so that I can further better myself, I believe toner has some use. If not only for a refreshing spray to completely wake me up after my relaxing warm morning shower, which is after I drag myself out of my warm, comfortable bed, to lead a repetitious and questionably pointless life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of my wake-up habits and mindset, I believe this toner has some use for me, and perhaps you. Allow me to explain: I feel a sense of tightness after having used the toner, and I spray 2-3 times depending upon the distance of the bottle. Alongside this feeling of tightness is the refreshing sensation of having liquid sprayed on my face with a nice citrus scent, mmm mmm good. Does this product physically make my skin tighter? I&#x27;m not a scientist, nor am I a part of the FDA, but I will say it extracts moisture from my face, or at least makes my skin feel more dry. &amp;#34;Wait! Stephen, why would I want moisture removed from my face!? Why do I want a dry face!?&amp;#34; You might say to me in a bewildered manner. I would then say to you, &amp;#34;Hello potential new friend! I believe the moisture extraction is to allow for an easier time applying make-up to your face, or, in my case, to assist the anti-aging lotion in absorbing into my skin uninhibited. As I believe anti-aging lotion should be applied first. In addition, while this may not tighten or shrink my pores, the lotions I apply afterwards will definitely have an easier time doing so...&amp;#34; and so on. It&#x27;s a sort of paradoxical situation: I spray liquid on my face, which hydrates the skin, but the skin is left feeling &amp;#34;cleaner,&amp;#34; or more dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a toner that allows you to apply a lotion or some sort of &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; afterwards, with a nice refreshing citrus kick, then this is the toner for you. I also want to say it may brighten my skin a little bit, giving it a sort of &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; effect. Affect? Pretty sure it&#x27;s effect. And that it tightens my skin, if even a little bit, granted that may be a result of the skin feeling more dry. Does it remove wrinkles or get rid of sun damage? Not from my experience, but I would definitely say it helps my other lotions absorb into the skin, which includes an SPF- which prevents further wrinkling or sun damage from happening. So by the transitive property, this could mean the toner does help relieve the signs of wrinkling, aging, or other sun damage. Wear SPF, exercise, and eat a healthy diet. That last bit is more just life advice and doesn&#x27;t necessarily pertain to the toner.uation: I spray liquid on my face, which hydrates the skin, but the skin is left feeling &amp;#34;cleaner,&amp;#34; or more dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a toner that allows you to apply a lotion or some sort of &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; afterwards, with a nice refreshing citrus kick, then this is the toner for you.

    <li> It was alright! I liked it.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel fresh and tightens my pores!</li>
    <li> If you read my other reviews on InstaNatural products you will see I am a fan for the most part so when I got the opportunity to try their toner I was super excited....welll... I&#x27;m not so excited anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner is just ok, but like many others have said it is not worth the price. It does have a strong floral scent (which is the geranium oil). I like it but I can see where it could be overwhelming to those who are sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also not a fan of spray toners, I like to apply toner with a cotton pad. I honestly can&#x27;t say I saw a reduction in my pores by using this. If it just said it was a toner with no claims to reduce pores, I would&#x27;ve rated it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I think InstaNatural needs to change immediately is the print on the bottle. The white lettering on a light yellow background is not good plus the print is super tiny. I actually had to go back to the Amazon page and look at the print with the magnifier option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To end on a good note I will say that is is refreshing and sprays on evenly and lightly. It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am still a fan of InstaNatural products, just a little disappointed with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
    <li> This is a great toner!! I use it every morning and every night after I wash my face. I like that I can spray it on my face, instead of having to constantly purchase cotton balls. This sprayed out in a very light mist, so it basically soaked into my skin right away, I didn&#x27;t have to dab anything off. So that makes me love it even more! It also smelled great, like oranges! I was given this product for testing purposes, but these are my honest opinions!!</li>
    <li> hesitant to use this due to the colloidal silver!  why does that need to be in this?</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING, like roses and grapefruits combined.  It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing and really does gently exfoliate as a toner should.  I feel like a rich lady when I spritz this on my face, it smells that great!  I also like to spray about 5 pumps on a cotton ball directly and swipe it over my face (as opposed to the directions for use, which is to spritz on your face and swipe off with a cotton ball).  I get more &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; when I spray the cotton ball and swipe over my face that way.</li>
    <li> maybe it is a good product but the SMELL IS STRONG LIKE RAID or something. Strong chemical smell.Has to go back</li>
    <li> She enjoys  and likes this,  It is a little expensive but will see how far it goes,  Said it works great and thus she is happy with the purchase,</li>
    <li> I truly love this company and brand i have had the pleasure to review and use many of their full size products and i am always satisfied for many reasons they smell amazing and use many natural great ingredients that i truly adore i love how i can see that my pores are starting to get a little smaller and iv only been using this for a few weeks can wait to see how they will look after a few months! this is my honest and truthful opinion! #sponcerd</li>
    <li> I love the fine mist of this potent vitamin C toner. I use it every morning right after a scrub to balance pH levels and repair signs of aging. I love the scent and the feel of this product. It is lasting me forever too! It is great to have a toner with so many perks and benefits. I hope you give it a try!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know If I got a bad bottle, but given my history with InstaNatural I will give them the benefit of the dobut here. I couldn&#x27;t even use this. It smelled like moldy, hyalournic acid. I got so sick after smelling this, and even threw up. I am saddened, I have heard good things about this, and really wanted to love it. Complementary product received for review</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Not only do I LOVE how this makes my skin feel (and look) but it smells great too. If you haven&#x27;t tried any of the products from InstaNatural, do yourself a favor and try them all! They are truly amazing and my skin is so much healthier and radiant since I&#x27;ve made the switch.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My face feels so refreshed after putting it on. And has great anti-aging effects on my skin!</li>
    <li> I am so spoiled by this InstaNatual line. It leaves my skin feeling amazing. I ordered this to add to my collection, and was really excited to try it. I got the package, and it had leaked everywhere. Understandably disappointed, I contacted InstaNatural. Not only did they respond almost immediately, they sent me another bottle, on 2 day shipping, FREE. Without me even asking. This company is great, not only for their products, but with customer service too. I finally got to use the toner with my face ritual last night, and I swear, I won&#x27;t use anything else. Ever. If you want your skin to feel like baby skin, get this toner, and get their Vitamin C serum. Trust me. Your skin will thank you!</li>
    <li> It is a really nice toner it doesnt make me break out a lot.and it doesnt sting.</li>
    <li> doesnt work what so ever and ive been using it for 2 months, plus it stinks, i think the ratings are fake. i received an email asking if i was satisfied, i said no, they said they&#x27;ll give me a refund, but no they did not, also bought another product from them that ive been using even longer and no results at all! don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to use this toner because the white printing on the yellow label is impossible to read.  I thought I&#x27;d try this since I&#x27;ve never used toner before, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right!  This product smells great and citrusy.  I&#x27;ve been spraying it on my face after cleaning, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference either positive or negative.</li>
    <li> Got strong odor but I don&#x27;t see no different on my skin. Revise now I been trying Vitamin C for 3 wks.my skin feel more firm</li>
    <li> Love this product love the smell!</li>
    <li> Great product works well.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but praises for this product. I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin. I&#x27;ve also been getting complements that I&#x27;ve been glowing, so maybe it does work! But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I really love InstaNatural products! This toner is refreshing and leaves my skin feeling firm and tight, but in a good way! I like the refreshing scent too! I&#x27;m using it with a gentle cleanser and the InstaNatural Age-Defying Skin Clearing Serum and The InstaNatural Vitamin C Moisturzer. Great products!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works very well.</li>
    <li> It tones my skin well and gets off all the rest of my makeup when I use this , I mean every last bit . It smells wonderful and comes in a nice big bottle .</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels refreshing but I am not a huge toner person - I can&#x27;t seem to spray my face very well with my eyes closed (I am a clutz) so I prefer applying it with a cotton ball though I lose more that way.....</li>
    <li> This toner really gets the job done and I am impressed with the ingredients. I have very oily skin and it is hard to prevent it because my face gets greasy by the hour. I am fond with the scent since citrus aromas bring the best out of my day and this helps prevent my face from getting any more greaser. I can finally touch my face and not worry any oil on my slight fingertips. :) This also has added vitamin C to give your skin extra love and this is good for all skin types! Want to read more about the toner in greater detail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://lastnightwithlee.blogspot.com/2015/02/sponsored-post-instanatural-dead-sea.html</li>
    <li> I use a variety of InstaNatural products from serums, hair mask and moisturizers, but this toner is my least favorite.  It left my skin feeling sticky, as if I needed to start the cleansing process all over again.  I used it for less than a week, and went back to my preferred toner.</li>
    <li> I bought this toner based off seeing all the &#x27;positive&#x27; reviews. After I received the product, I read the reviews more closely and realized that almost ALL of the reviews were from &#x27;people&#x27; who received this toner for free! Not only does that influence how someone rates a product but the amount of fake reviews bumps this up to the number one spot on Amazon, beating out other products that actually work and are not abusing amazon&#x27;s star review system. I am completely disappointed that amazon allows this to happen. Not only does this toner smell plastic and fake (contradicts the name of the company, INSTANATURAL) but it does absolutely nothing. Waste of Money. This is a REAL REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like spray in my face, I spray in my palm and use fingers tip to pat in my face, just 3 days I find my pores tight and small,&lt;br /&gt;really good product....</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s creamy and i don&#x27;t feel comfy when i spread  it on my face.</li>
    <li> Great product....great product line....look at more of their products...I purchased the serum and the moisturizer...great products!</li>
    <li> Yep. InstaNatural does it AGAIN! This is now my new favorite toner. Amazing ingredients. I used to make my own toners but never did I get so involved with all the great additions like MSM and collodial silver. I will echo what another reviewer said about the witch hazel - it does help to astringe and tighten the pores and skin, but there is absolutely no burning or stinging after applying this toner. The smell is very pleasant with the rose geranium. I&#x27;ve been using it whenever I wash my face, followed by InstaNatural&#x27;s Vit C serum and Vit C moisturizer. I have been so happy with the combination of these products. My skin feels clean all day long, is less oily, and I&#x27;ve had less acne and break outs. I highly recommend this product for part of a great skin care protocol.</li>
    <li> Another great product from InstaNatural. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This toner is so nice. I love the smell and it easily makes my skin feel refreshed. I use it after washing my face and skin care routine. My skin is gaining its elasticity. It is great.</li>
    <li> Best toner I ever had!. Clean and tighten my pores without drying the skin. I never breakout and very calming for acne prone skin. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchased with InstaNatural&#x27;s products. Highly recommended and excellent customer service!.</li>
    <li> I dont put anything on my face unless this is applied first. It is refreshing and a gret primer for other Insta Natural products.I do love most of their products. Tey have a great line.</li>
    <li> I started this product with the Aloe Cleanser &amp; Soothing Creams from The Body Shop. Can&#x27;t specifically credit one or the other since I&#x27;m not too sure which is more effective, but with the use of both products, my skin has gotten clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, so I break out daily. I also pick at my face, leaving scars, redness, and big pores. But with the use of my two new products, I break out less, redness from face is gone, redness from scars is gone, and on some days my pores look smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this simply for the Vitamin C aspect of a facial spray, and have another product from a different company on the way. That product is half the price of this one, but I may continue to buy InstaNatural, since it did help my face get better and proved its worth. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Just received, face tingles when used and adds freshness after washing your face.</li>
    <li> Works great, brightens skins</li>
    <li> I mist this on my face and neck every morning! Very refreshing and so easy to apply. The scent is pretty citrus smelling so it&#x27;s a nice energizer.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff, does a really good job with making my face feel fresh</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the spray...don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been fond of toners, it seems they always leave a residue behind. So far I&#x27;m really liking this, my skin feels clean but not overdry. Bonus: Vitamin C for added goodness!</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin. Great purchase!! I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Fresh scent, feels refreshing. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite brand! I have been trying as many of their products as I can and I haven&#x27;t found one that disappoints yet. They all feel great and I have been noticing a huge difference in my fine lines on my forehead. These are so much better than the products that you can purchase from the store. I am now an InstaNatural Girl!</li>
    <li> Love this product .it has a wonderful scent and does what it&#x27;s supposed to..my face is so smoothe and feels so hydrated</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so refreshing! I don&#x27;t notice any difference to my face, and I have been using it daily for the past 2 months, but it is refreshing to spray in the morning.</li>
    <li> I carry this with me all&lt;br /&gt;The time and spritz my face.  Love it and will purchase more</li>
    <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite face product. The spray factor makes a huge difference to me in actually using it when I&#x27;m in a hurry and I love the scent - smells like a newly peeled orange. My face looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> Toning is a step that many people skip, but it is the second step of cleansing you&#x27;re skin. I&#x27;m an Esthetician, so I&#x27;ve been espousing the benefits of using a toner for many years. The InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Toner is very nice. My skin tends to be dehydrated, but breaks out easily, too. This is hydrating and light; don&#x27;t expect to feel that sting you may be expecting if you have been using an alcohol-based toner. I&#x27;ve been using the InstaNatural oil cleanser, and this is the perfect follow-up. The scent is fresh and clean, somewhat citrus-y as expected.</li>
    <li> I like the mist and smell of tje product and that it gives me a fresh face. I like that its absorb by my skin faily quickly and it does not ruin my makeup or any face products for that matter, in the summer this will be my best friend</li>
    <li> My skin now is smooth.</li>
    <li> I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews. I&#x27;m 36 have always battled severe acne and discoloration. It&#x27;s generally horrible. I started with just the serum, then added the cleanser, then the night cream, then the toner and then the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this combination of products has drastically improved the look feel and overall health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner has been great in balancing out my skins blotches and discolorations and works as a great prep for makeup application in the morning. It also feels just so refreshing to apply after cleansing too. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or stripped either which is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis.  I&#x27;ve never felt better about my own face and it&#x27;s because I decided to invest in a line of quality products that actually works for me. I have tried several other product lines on both the mainstream cosmetic side and the natural side resulting in poor or nightmarish results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s something about this line that just works for me and I&#x27;m so thankful.  I may sound a little dramatic here but for me it&#x27;s a big deal. Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  I recommend this line to anyone with combination and sensitive skin. It all takes a little getting used to but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like this toner. I use it everyday. This is the first toner like this that I have used. I like that it is a spray on, I get better coverage with it.</li>
    <li> Nope, nope, nope. Once i sprayed it on my face it burned and left my skin really dry :-(</li>
    <li> I might update my review later since I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but I wanted to make one statement about the odor, which seems to be the only topic in the negative reviews. I have been really anxious to see how bad it smells since I ordered. Would I buy a candle with this odor? No, not a chance. It smells a little earthy with citrus, which I don&#x27;t mind. It is a somewhat strong odor but nothing to give me a headache or make me vomit, not sure if those symptoms are related to the product... all in all I wouldn&#x27;t listen to the very few negative reviews about the smell unless you are super sensitive to that stuff.</li>
    <li> Feels very refreshing on your face.  I have purchased this for family members and they like it too.  Nice subtle scent and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Regrettably, my skin is sensitive to one of the ingredients as I felt a burning sensation after a few sprays over my face.&lt;br /&gt;As I never had any problems with any products before, I initially shrugged off the burning sensation I felt as my skin being too dry, however, it was getting quite uncomfortable so I decided to email the customer service to seek advice. One of their rep quickly told me to discontinue use of the product and automatically gave me a full refund on my order, all within 12hrs. Amazing customer service and top notch service quality.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad this doesn&#x27;t work for me so I can&#x27;t give any reviews of the product but it allowed me to experience their fabulous service. Thanks again .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received this in discount for exchange of an unbiased opinion&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love how clean and fresh my face feels after using this toner. I use it every other day (sensitive skin) and have had no issues. My face is staying clear and looks less dull.</li>
    <li> I love vitamin C product. I love it. I got a high discount code for purchase this product. I use this produce to make my face looks brighter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care of it! it doesn&#x27;t do much and doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
    <li> I use it after getting out of the shower and then put on the night cream, it smells like spraying an orange on my face, not sure if in conjunction with the night cream it has made difference, but I like the citrus scent.  I use it nightly after getting out of the shower and spritzing with the vitamin c facial toner first</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I feel lost without it!</li>
    <li> Love this toner!! It&#x27;s refreshing without stinging my face or smelling harsh!!</li>
    <li> Is very refreshing when it is sprayed on face! I really like tue &amp;#34;citrusy&amp;#34; smell!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It has really helped the health if my skin when used in combination with their Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see what the positives are. It&#x27;s like spraying water IMO. Might have some stuff in it or the intention, but results and feeling of product is not noticeable. Hate the fake hype about the product. Don&#x27;t give them your money. This should cost 5 bucks max!</li>
    <li> Love these products!&lt;br /&gt;This toner is very refreshing and leave my skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> It really wakes my up in the morning when I use it. The scent of it just boosts my energy levels up and it feels really moisturizing when I use it!</li>
    <li> I bought the product to help with oil control and it didn&#x27;t seem to help. Outstanding customer service though</li>
    <li> This is one of the best pore tightening vitamin c facial toner ive ever tried. Ive noticed many amazing changes with my  appearance after using this toner.. #1 my pores are fading away and getting smaller (in love) #2 my face no longer appears that shiny (bye bye excessive oil) #3 the best part is that my face always looks hydrated...&lt;br /&gt;Really recommend it&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my Honest and unbiased feedback</li>
    <li> Cost too much and does nothing.</li>
    <li> Terrific toner with great smell! I love InstaNatural product since it always smells good without irritating perfume smell!</li>
    <li> Wonderful Toner !  It tightens and tones skin !</li>
    <li> Love instaNatural products. I have a few other instaNatural  products and love them all.</li>
    <li> At first this was wonderful. My face felt clean and refreshed when I spritzed it. It also smelled very good. I would spritz and then swipe with a cotton round, and then do one last light spritz. After using for a couple weeks, I got a severe break-out. I thought maybe this was a fluke and continued using it. The breakout got worse and worse and I discontinued.</li>
    <li> Love it and smells great!</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of this InstaNatural vitamin C toner. It&#x27;s such a nice and relaxing mist after washing all my makeup off. I love that this toner has both witch hazel and tea tree oil in it to help with my adult acne. So far I have noticed my face clearing up since I started using this toner. I&#x27;ve also noticed my pores look smaller. This toner has made it so easy for my moisturizer to penetrate into my skin. It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin like mine. It&#x27;s gentle and very effective. I am so happy I have included this vitamin C facial toner into my daily skincare routine. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> In Luv with this company!! I recently ordered the VC Serum, VC Toner, which smells Divine, &amp; their Awesome Moisturizer. The toner leaked during transit and CS instantly and graciously shipped a replacement bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely a Fave company now!!&lt;br /&gt;Great natural ingredients, good pricing with Outstanding communication, what more can we ask for Ladies??!!&lt;br /&gt;Take Care &amp; Cheers,  Zoe</li>
    <li> Side effects e.g pimples etc</li>
    <li> I like this very much. The spray bottle is very convenient. Easy to apply and i like the way my skin looks since using InstaNatural products.</li>
    <li> It dried my skin out awfully. So much that I started breaking out. I should have spot tested but I didn&#x27;t think this would do something like that.</li>
    <li> Feels refreshing when applied right after washing my face.</li>
    <li> This seals the deal with the scrub, and lotion. The tri works great for my acnes prone, oily skin. Best product I have ever used! I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it works very well, I love it refreshed my skin feels after applying the tonner</li>
    <li> I love this toner. I have dry skin, and also get bad blemishes very easy. I have had a hard time finding a toner that works without breaking me out, or over drying my skin. This stuff is awesome! My skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and gives you a nice clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical about skin products since my skin is pretty sensitive and breaks out easily.  After receiving this product in the mail...WOWWWW I am so happy I was able to try it.  I can see the difference on the size of my pores and how my skin feels.  My husband and coworkers had complimented me that my face seems to be glowing  after using this product for 2 weeks.  I am so glad I found this product and will be using it from now on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, but I prefer the Vitamin C skincare line from The Bodyshop better.</li>
    <li> Love this toner and the smell!</li>
    <li> This is a great product line that is improving my teen daughters cystic acne. I wanted a less chemical treatment and this seems to be helping. Breakouts are fewer and less inflamed and clear faster.</li>
    <li> I spray this Vitamin C facial toner all over my face, hands, body and legs every time I am out of the shower to keep my skin hydrated. So far, I feel that my skin is smooth and pores do shrink. Not sure if because of this product or some other Vitamin C or Niacinamide (i.e. Vitamin B3) that I have been applying. Regardless, applying Vitamin C topically works more effective than consuming it. Of course, if financially permitted then you should consume Vitamin C and use this facial toner at the same time,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever people apply or take Vitamin C as supplement, they usually want a fairer skin and to improve their immune system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this facial toner works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,</li>
    <li> It is hard to find toners anymore.  This one presents the Vitamin C in a different manner than the serums that are so popular.  It feels great, and gets that extra little bit of makeup after cleansing at night off of your face.  I was given this product free to review.</li>
    <li> Very REFRESHING to my face. Byebye, shiny face</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Wake up with a fresh spray :)</li>
    <li> Love this!! I use it everyday as a post- moisturizer spritz to feel fresh and fantastic!  Gives my face that last seal of protection against the harsh air and particles of the city.  It&#x27;s also a confidence booster as I know my coconut oil&#x27;ed face has yet another layer of goodness.  Also helps to wake me up!  When I spray it on I know its time to walk out the door and tackle life&#x27;s obstacles!  The cool mist sprays evenly with a gentle force and can&#x27;t help to let out a silent &amp;#34;ahhhhhhhhh.&amp;#34;  Recommend for healthy faces and healthy skin.  And smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a reviewer, aside from the fact I spend too much of my day ordering anything that looks remotely beneficial from Amazon. But alas, I found something that works. I love every Instanatural product I&#x27;ve tried. This toner works wonders post chemical peel. My skin is glowing! My boyfriend, who hardly notices when I cut my hair, had told me multiple times how nice my skin looks since I switch to their products. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen migh improvement with my pores but overall a good product</li>
    <li> I love the way this toner feels. It leaves my face feeling clean and not dry like other toners I have used.</li>
    <li> I used it and boy what a great feeling your face get once it hit your skin. You will feel the differences right away. My wife used it to and she loves it. Now she&#x27;s asked my how did I find this product and I told she on amazon and through someone else. I got to order some more. That you for this wonderful facial toner.</li>
    <li> Great natural toneR that leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was packaged well.  I absolutely love this product!  It has an amazing refreshing scent, but not too strong.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily, yet it feels as though the moisture is really penetrating my skin.  My face feels better than it has in ages!  The pores on my face are less visible than before also.  I feel confident in this product as it is an all natural, organic product.  Thanks again for an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Use this every morning and night and my pores are shrinking and overall my skin is much smoother. Love the smell</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Fast result. I ordered due to good deal. But its quality if better than I thought. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like to hydrate in the morning, quite refreshing.</li>
    <li> A new permanent part of beauty regimine!</li>
    <li> This product really works,my complexion as improved more even toned,i finally found a skin toner that really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now together with the Retinol Moisturizer  and Vitamin C serum, so far I like them all. I love the fresh rose scent,I hope I could get a little improvement after a month of using this product in my skin, if yes, maybe I would buy another bottle and keep all you guys posted.</li>
    <li> Been using for 2 weeks.  I like it so far!</li>
    <li> I use this toner as soon as I get out of the shower after washing my face. I use a cotton ball and that dreaded dirt shows up, as if I didn’t even wash my face at all! On a good note, it only takes two sides of a cotton ball to see improvement, unlike two or three when I used Australian Tea Tree Oil on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was suggested to keep this toner in the fridge for a cool burst when it’s sprayed on your face. I did that  once, and I forgot about putting it on until I looked in the fridge for lunch. If your memory is better than mine and you’re not constantly distracted, it’s a good feeling when cold toner hits your face for an instant pick-me-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added this to my arsenal of InstaNatural products. Their products work great, and this toner is no exception. It helps keep my skin clean and refreshed all day.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Toner, makes my skin feel amazing. A must have.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE TONER I A, WAITING FOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using insta natural production for the passed 9 months, and like them very much. I was wishing for a  good toner, that&#x27;s does not smell like alcohol or funny. This fits  my  bill, and I just love  how fresh this made my  skin feels,and the  glow  afterward. Definitely a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered to tried this with discount, but my opinion are honest , and unbiased.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of information out there about using Vitamin C based skin care products in general but especially for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin. Now that I am edging into that category I was pleased to have a chance to try several Vit.C products by InstaNatural. The toner I will alternate daily with the alcohol free toner from Neutrogena that is my go to product. The Vitamin C Facial Toner is great in the summer months, especially if I have been working hard all day. After a day spent working on cars or cutting wood, it is nice to have a deep cleaning toner on hand that won&#x27;t harm my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I like this toner. It&#x27;s light and one pump is all you need so the bottle lasts forever. As to whether it is helping with lines, age spots, and the like, the jury is still out, as I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to determine that.</li>
    <li> Awesome toner!  InstaNatural makes wonderful products, and this toner is one of them!  Leaves your skin feeling refreshed.  The company stands behind it&#x27;s products and sends follow-up emails to be sure you are happy with the product with detailed information on how to best use the product.  Fast delivery and item was well packaged.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. It smells great and works well.</li>
    <li> Not very good spray, a little dries the skin. For oily skin will be fine.</li>
    <li> Fantastic smell and tone qualities! Use just a dab on a cotton ball - works wonders for oily noses.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful and smells great!</li>
    <li> No alcohol absolutely, and it feels great after I used it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels in the morning so refreshing</li>
    <li> Smells good.  I like the fact that this is a spray.I have only used for a few days so still waiting to see results.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels and smells. Very gentle and my sensitive skin loves it just fine!</li>
    <li> Ah this toner smells so fresh and it makes my skin feel light and tight. I think its definitely balancing my facial pH levels. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
    <li> WOW!  That&#x27;s my initial and continued reaction to this toner! From day 1, to now - about a week later - I have adored this product.  I was really excited about using a toner again, it&#x27;d been years since I have, and I remember the refreshing feeling it gave, but also the tightness which led me to be a bit nervous, also.  So, I followed instructions, washed, patted dry, spritzed about 6 inches away, opened my eyes and .... no stinging, no redness, just an overall sense of  &amp;#34;ahhhhhh&amp;#34;.  I smoothed it around my face, under-chin (there&#x27;s some French word for that?), and neck.  Before continuing onto the other products I have from Insta Naturals (LOVE their products) I waited.... this didn&#x27;t take long to dry and it wasn&#x27;t sticky, wasn&#x27;t oily (not sure what happened to other&#x27;s toner but this wasn&#x27;t oily at all, just a light fine mist), my skin was soft and didn&#x27;t feel too dry.  The mist came out in very fine particles, and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the spray pattern, it was a full and complete 360 degrees of super fine mist. The scent is not as strong as I expected, from reading the reviews I was actually looking forward to a very citrus&#x27;y scent, lol.  It&#x27;s faint and fades once the mist settles. And, uhm, as some one had reviewed with low stars, earlier - keep your eyes and mouth closed (really, Einstein??) and don&#x27;t inhale for the 3 seconds it takes to mist the face and neck and chest.  That will solve any problem of, ahem, getting it into your mouth and eyes.  O_o  Onto the good stuff:  I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with the hyraluronic (sorry if I butchered the spelling) serum, and the night cream.  So, cleanse, tone, serum, moisturize - BAM, done in 3 minutes!  And, this toner alone shrunk my pores noticeably, but with all 3 products, my skin is the best it&#x27;s looked in years!!  I&#x27;m glowing (no I&#x27;m not pregnant), my skin tone is even, pores are gone except for the stubborn few on my cheeks, my wrinkles are at least half of what they were a week ago!, my saggyfeeling &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; skin is  now taught and elastic, the layers of bags are 90% gone... I&#x27;ve been using the 3 products for a week.  My routine before this:  cleanse, moisturize... occasional exfoliation. I started with the serum, and it was great! Then, I added toner and the night cream - my skin is so supple and soft, and even, (the odd bumps that weren&#x27;t pimples, but some aggravation, I guess, are completely gone), I&#x27;m not breaking out like I used to (acne prone and oily, with odd oily flaky skin?), I&#x27;m just overall totally and completely in love with this product and the complete line I have.  I so highly recommend this, a serum, and a moisturizer.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d notice such a difference, but as I sit here, in the morning, sleep deprived and dehydrated, my face looks like I had wonderful beauty sleep and that I have a professional face fixer-upper.</li>
    <li> This one is a must have too .. It tones your skin and it feels so good, and the way it holds the moisture in I&#x27;m very happy with all the products I have gotten</li>
    <li> In the past I had an allergic reaction to Vitamin C containing skincare products but with the InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Toner, my skin was irritation free! After using it for a week, my large pores around my cheeks were smaller and my skin was not as oily in the morning after applying this the night before. My skin type is combination-oily. This toner is very gentle on my skin and there is no burning sensation that you might get from other brands of toners because this doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels on my face! It really gives my skin a nice glow! I highly suggest getting this and including it in your facial routine!</li>
    <li> This toner is great, it does everything it claims. It helps with large pores, helped a lot with my dull skin and now is brighter. It does not dries out your skin and it&#x27;s great if you want to apply a serum after. Its very lightweight and it applies as a gentle mist to your face.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the customer service is amazing, they answer the emails quickly enough and help you with any concerns you may have. They gave me tips on how to use this toner and the serum I bought.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a spray,,,not sure why they tell you to wipe off excess with a cotton ball or pad.  It works great.  Goes right into your skin</li>
    <li> I love this toner!  I use it after cleansing and before serum and moisturizer (not from the same company).  It seems to prepare my skin so the serum and moisturizer absorb more easily into my skin.  I would love to try more of their products!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Not to oily goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t have a smell. Received a discount for my review.</li>
    <li> I really like this product line.  I have been using the eye gel and the vitamin C serum, so I thought I&#x27;d give the toner a try.  It feels refreshing, and really tightens pores for a smooth finish.  I apply the vitamin C serum, them eye gel, over it while my skin is still damp. After a few seconds of drying time, my skin is ready for makeup (am) or bedtime (pm).</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is so easy to use and you can even wear it under your makeup. It literally dries in less than a minute.</li>
    <li> When using this product it was something new for me. I needed some new facial products to be rid of problem spots and I figure this would help out for the time being while having the chance of using it for the first time. I do recommend this product to anyone looking to tone their looks.</li>
    <li> Great product! I can not say enough good about this company and the way they stand behind their products. I love this product - it is pure, clean and it works!.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely loving this toner! It is made with all natural and anti aging ingredients - properties that I gravitate towards. I noticed that it does a wonderful job as far as cleaning my skin and pores go. It&#x27;s also gentle on my crazy sensitive skin - so I can use it as much as I want! I have been using it in the morning before I put on my makeup, because it does help in shrinking my pores. I don&#x27;t have to use as much primer or foundation to hide my big pores and I love it! I also use it before I go to bed because it cleans all the dirt and makeup from my face and preps it for my other anti aging and moisturizing products. It truly is a great product that&#x27;s worth trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services that I use personally and believe will be good for consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to review for free for exchange for an honest..It&#x27;s a huge 4oz bottle will last a long time and provides a great value to it&#x27;s name. The bottle comes with a Lifetime Money Back Guarantee, no matter where you buy our product. If you&#x27;re not satisfied,  just contact the company and get a full refund. I love this toner is multi-benefit with several ingredients that really are workhorses in my opinion. Vitamin C Facial Toner is totally organic I love stuff that are totally organic. It makes me less worry about putting those other chemical toners on my face!  The serums and moisturizers seem to be more effective on my face.  It just takes a second to adds that additional benefits. It  be small enough to be a travel bottle and bring it on my next plane trip to prevent really dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the first thing I spray on my face. The bright, fresh scent wakes me up the bottle is the perfect application of this amazing toner. It smells like oranges to me.</li>
    <li> This toner smells really good. It doesnt leave my face feeling tight and It&#x27;s full of really good ingredients that help repair skin and balance it&#x27;s ph. The bottle sprays out wierd to me thats why i&#x27;m giving it 4 stars but its worth trying!</li>
    <li> These skincare products are great!</li>
    <li> So ive used this toner well over 30 days now and have to say I find it too drying and it also has a sticky feel to it.  Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing, full of great ingredients you want on your skin!  This is a great line, people.</li>
    <li> Good stuff only using it a few days and skin is tighter and pores smaller</li>
    <li> In past my wife used a few products in similar category but this one is amazing. She is pretty happy with the results although it&#x27;s just been over 3 weeks. I use it sometimes too. We like its spraying technique. Instead of taking it on your palms first, just spray it directly on your face. I dries off immediately leaving a clean and smooth feeling behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sure I&#x27;m going to continue using it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few toners over the past 10 years, trying to find one that would do well for me and my skin type. I suffer from dry skin, which tends to get worse in the fall and winter months. When I first tried this, I didn&#x27;t have too many high hopes for it. Vitamin C tends to dry my skin out, and toners have always been harsh on my skin. I am happy to say that this toner completely changed the game for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a cotton round to spritz this on, and I do this after I have gently washed my face. This removes any left over dirt, makeup or what have you. I then take a 2nd cotton round and repeat the process, this time really toning my face. Even with my dry skin, this does not at all irritate, or dry my skin out. It feels nice on my skin, gentle yet tough enough to do a proper job. It does shrink my pores, and I find that since using this, I have had to less and less clogged pore extractions. After I use this I continue on with my facial serum, and finish with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t too bad. It really reminds me of a orange rind. It comes in a nice size bottle, with a spray nozzle that releases a find mist of the toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this, how gentle it has been on my dry skin. It has earned its spot in my daily skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I have been using soap and water to wash my face for years. However it feels like I get a buildup on my face so it doesn’t leave it feeling very clean. I have also wanted something that gets down into the pores cleaning them out. I had heard of people using a toner and loving them. They say your skin feels much cleaner and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try the InstaNatural free of charge in return for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;Instanatural is one of my favorite skincare companies. All of their products are the highest quality products and are usually way above its competitors. Their products are always reasonably priced and last a long time. I got this toner in a nice bright good sized bottle. I applied the toner to a cotton ball and spread evenly across the skin on my face and neck. The first thing I noticed was the nice cooling feeling I got making my skin feel super clean and refreshed. It rubs in easily leaving no residue or buildup behind. Since using this toner 2 times daily I have noticed a reduction in acne without any over drying or making my skin too oily. A toner will now always be an important part of my skincare regimen. Fabulous product!</li>
    <li> I was sent this Toner to try out for free and leave my own feedback, I am loving this toner very much, I think it works very well in tightening and clearing up my pores. I use this before my moisturizer and serum it does great prep work for other products to be absorbed into your skin. It dries very quickly as well. I like the smell of it but I guess it&#x27;s not a scent everyone can enjoy. My significant other doesn&#x27;t enjoy it all that much but I really like it I think it smells like grapefruit.</li>
    <li> I have been using InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Facial Toner everyday for about three weeks! And may I say it is awesome! I can&#x27;t believe I went without using it for years, never knowing what I was missing. Now I know, and I will not be going back to the days of not using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First thing I noticed about the Vitamin C Facial Toner was how easy it was to use. It comes in a spray bottle. I used it every time I got out of the shower, just closed my eyes and sprayed it evenly on my face. Most of the spray absorbed into my skin within a few short seconds. If I had any extra that did not absorb I simply dabbed it off with a cotton ball and I was done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The second thing I love about this product is the smell! It smells like oranges! The smell seemed to make me feel 100% fresher, and it also seemed to make me feel more awake and alert! Every time I walked out of the bathroom my oldest son would say, &amp;#34;Mommy you smell really good! Like morning!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And of course there are the results; My skin feels amazing!! Simply Amazing! My skin looks younger, smoother, and more hydrated. It feels smoother, more hydrated and more elastistic. I am having much fewer (almost non-existent) breakouts, the skin on my forehead no longer peels or flakes, and I just feel fresher and younger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have used toners in the past that were over priced, hard to apply, and had a sharp chemical smell, not to mention the stinging feeling. Nothing I have ever tried compares to this product! It is simply amazing! I love it! I recommend it to anyone and everyone! Buy it for yourself, for your mom, your friend, your neighbor, your teacher... pretty much anyone! It is a great gift idea, or a great treat for yourself!</li>
    <li> I really like this toner. I use it after a shower because my skin is so dry. The toner hydrates well and even smells good. I recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Very light and refreshing. I use it before moisterizer in the morning. Also, I  sometimes use a quick spray in the afternoon as a pick me up ,the winter heating does have drying effects. Light citrus sent. I like it.</li>
    <li> My new best toner! I love the citrus smell, my face feels so refreshed after and and no oily. I use it in the morning and at night time and I could see the changes in the pores reduction, my face has a glow. I just love it! Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The toner leaves my face feeling light and refreshed, I like that there is no residue and the spray feature makes it pretty easy to use. I have combination skin and this toner really helps balance it out. The toner does have a stronger scent than what I was expecting but it is not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> I have been determined to find to find a facial toner that comes in a spray bottle, leaves my skin feeling refreshed, and has a small that I can handle.  When InstaNatural sent me this product to review, I was hesitant because of other reviewers complaining about the smell, however this toner smells fantastic in my opinion; very fresh and citrus/orange-y.  It also comes in a convenient spray bottle, which is a must for me when it comes to toners.  A few moments after spraying it on, I can already feel my skin tightening - it definitely works as described!  My only complaint is that it leaves my skin feeling more greasy than I would expect from a toner.  I could see this more being used as a make-up removing toner that I would wipe off immediately vs a toner veil, more like what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Sadly, this didn&#x27;t fulfill the role of my holy grail toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about InstaNatural?  Their guarantee: InstaNatural is proud to back their products with a 100% Lifetime Satisfaction Guarantee Policy. If you are not completely happy with your purchase, just contact them for a refund - no questions asked. They are confident you will enjoy results - or get your money back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and I love how it soothes and tones my face. It tightens pores and preps your skin for other treatments. The instanatural serums pair perfectly with this. The vitamin c in this product boosts facial tone and overall appearance. I also love how simply and efficiently it dispences... a couple spritzes and you are set. It dries quickly so you can apply your next product. Great addition to my facial routine.</li>
    <li> This product is great for people who have a naturally oily completion and large pores. It helps reduce facial oils and greatly minimized the pores</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Vitamin C Facial Toner and I must say I am in love with this product already. It leaves my face feeling clean and oh so soft and I&#x27;m amazed at how my complexion is starting to even out as a result.  I would recommend this product over and over again, its definitely worth a try.  Very Satisfied Customer in Maryland USA.</li>
    <li> My face looks Great, I use this above all other products now!</li>
    <li> I like using it and it doesnt irate my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the second product I have used from this brand and they haven&#x27;t let me down yet!  I have noticed a difference in reduction of the amount of oil production on my skin but it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this toner and the customer service provided by InstaNatural (received a personal e-mail to ensure that I was fully satisfied).  The toner provides a great clean feeling afterwards and it really provides a nice base and preparation for any moisturizer I use.  Two thumbs up and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Almost finish my fist bottle, LOVE it. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It smells wonderful and and the bottle dispenses a nice fine spray.  It makes my face feel fresh!</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my face feel</li>
    <li> Nice light scent, makes my face feel clean.  i will be buying this again</li>
    <li> it have the different small than I though</li>
    <li> it disappears so fast from the face, noticed good results after 2 weeks of usage.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing, nice fragrance.  Can I say that it does any more than feel good?  Not really.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best facial toner I have ever had. I use it in the morning after wash before serum and it feels like it cleans the skin pretty well too. At night after wash I use only this toner and in the morning my face still feels squeaky clean. Will be hard to replace.</li>
    <li> liked product.  overpriced.  will not purchase at this price again.....product not different than others to warrant the price asked</li>
    <li> I like this product, and use it after I was my face. I do feel a tightening but I do not care for the smell.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and fresh feeling of this product. Not sure it tightens anything or makes me look younger but then I am 62.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
    <li> I really like this Toner. The spray is pretty even compared to other toners I&#x27;ve used in the past. Scent is amazing! I found that after using this toner, it was much easier to apply whatever I used afterwards (Vitamin C Serum, Eye Serum, and Eye moisturizer by InstaNatural) I sound like an advertisement, but their products actually work.... My skin has been looking noticeably healthier than it has in almost 10 years. And it is only after 2 months of daily use!  I spray 4 times. Targeting each cheek and also my forehead. 4th spray is a light tap to the nose. Works for me ^-^  Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> The smell was too strong. The spray nozzle didn&#x27;t work right. Very Disappointed!</li>
    <li> This toner feels so amazing when on. It sprays on very evenly. The smell is citrus and very nice. Since I&#x27;ve started using it my skin has done a 360. I would recommend everyone add it to their daily routine!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, does what it says and smells nice.</li>
    <li> a. ble to try this wonderful products on a deeply discounted price and I&#x27;m very glad that I did. Is a refreshing spray to be used in the mornings to light up your skin greatly reduces pores and leave your skin feeling wonderful. A must add to your morning beauty routine!</li>
    <li> Good, Cooling and Refreshing!! :)</li>
    <li> Great product brightens your face.</li>
    <li> This product IS good for your skin, and it does help tighten your pores and skin over all, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good. :(</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin.  Makes my face feel fresh in the morning and night.</li>
    <li> The InstaNatural&#x27;s Pore Tightening Vitamin C Facial Toner arrived in a white spray bottle with a yellow/orange label. Similar to other beaut products, I test it out on my hand first to see if I&#x27;ll have any skin reaction to the product and of course to smell the product. The InstaNatural&#x27;s Facial Toner has a clear color and has a tangy/orange-y scent. It actually smells nice. :) After I tested it on my arm, I proceeded to try it on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions which is quite easy to follow. Instead of using it in the morning, I opted to use it at night before bedtime. Before using it, I cleanse my face with my facial cleanser, pat my face dry then spray the InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Toner all over my face and neck. I like the spray part because I remember the last toner I used should be applied with the use of a cotton ball. The spray application is much easier. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is a regular spray bottle and not a mist, it is normal that I experienced droplets of the toner dripping down my face. I just wipe the excess dripping droplets of toner off with tissue and let the remaining toner get absorbed. Just to be sure, I don&#x27;t open my eyes until the toner has been absorbed which takes less than a minute. The scent is very nice and very strong at first but in a few minutes (about 10 minutes), the scent goes away. It goes on cool on the face and gets absorbed very quickly. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy and I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts with using this facial toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the InstaNatural&#x27;s Pore Tightening Vitamin C Facial Toner for more than a week now and I love it. It made my skin less oilier and I&#x27;ve had less breakouts than before. My pores appeared smaller because my skin is less oilier and I feel like they&#x27;re clean and clear. Since this already has Vitamin C included, I&#x27;ve skipped using my Vitamin C Serum and just use this. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and like that it&#x27;s easily absorbed.</li>
    <li> As a child of an esthetician, I&#x27;ve been exposed to many types of facial care products throughout most of my life starting from around the age of 12. I would have to say that this is by far one of my favorite toners that I have used in the past 10 years. Although it seems a bit more expensive than my typical taste, this product seriously delivers what it is supposed to do which is the feeling of a clean face after use. Looks great, smells great, and feels great. All that is left to say is that I am running low on the last bottle I purchased and am seriously looking forward to round 2 with this toner.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> Love how it feels on the skin and how it lays under my makeup. Not sure if it&#x27;s really doing anything as far as skin care yet but that always takes time to see results. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try InstaNaturals&#x27; new Toner for free!&lt;br /&gt; InstaNaturals&#x27; never lets me down, ALWAYS a great product.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use. Just wash your face and then spray this on and use cotton ball to work it into the skin!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is AMAZING and I wish the smell alone lasted all day!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can find the full review on my blog that is listed on my profile.&lt;br /&gt;I do highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Facial Toner is great! I used another toner and I will change to this toner. It is really refreshing and smells good. This bottle is convenient for use too. This item selects spray bottle and it is really comfortable. I can use anytime and easy to use. If I want to use it, only pull handle once.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I am using it in conjunction with other InstaNatural products (cleanser, Vitamin C serum, moisturizer) and it works beautifully. It has a fresh, clean scent (think botanicals) and leaves my face clean and feeling moist. I have not experienced any stinging or irritation - it is very soothing. I do not spray it directly on my face as the directions suggest. Rather, I spray it on a clean cotton pad or cotton ball and then wipe my entire face with it, paying special attention to the forehead, chin and alongside the nose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Vitamin C toner as a part of my skincare regimen for the last 3 weeks.  Toner has not typically been something that I&#x27;ve used regularly and I have been pleasantly surprised by this product.  I use it after washing my face and as a make up setting spray during the day. It has a fresh citrus scent and sprays on in a fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has sulfur and witch hazel in it and feel that it helps to fight oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially liked using this as a makeup setting spray.  I just misted my face with the toner after applying my makeup for the day and felt that it helped keep everything in place longer than normal. I found myself touching up fewer times during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the manufacturer: &amp;#34;Our Vitamin C Facial Toner is the perfect way to tone and hydrate your skin while still delivering the powerful benefits of Vitamin C and other anti-aging elements. First, the sulfur in each spray will drive deep down to penetrate your skin and increase elasticity to maximize results. At the same time, the Witch Hazel present in the toner will gently purify your skin and pores, even helping to reduce their size and appearance. Simultaneously, Vitamin C renews and strengthens the skin to reverse the signs of aging and help prevent future damage. The Vitamin C Facial Toner is a great all-in-one hydrator that preps your skin to absorb serums and moisturizers more efficiently and effectively and is the perfect staple to add to your beauty regimen.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Feels refreshing and smells great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s refreshing but smells synthetic. Don&#x27;t like the fragrance</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I&#x27;m not so sure how I like the spray in it? We will see as I use it more.This product was free, with my own opions for review.</li>
    <li> I love this toner! Every morning I use it after washing my face and it feels great. The spray makes it easier to apply and has a great aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I use it now as part of my routine and I have seen my skin and pores better than before I used it.</li>
    <li> Very nice Vit C toner available for a great price! Very effective.</li>
    <li> I love the product a lot.it leaves a very smooth skin after use.</li>
    <li> Usually I buy smart and check the review before. Nobody like wasting money. I cant say  that I see or feel a big difference after using this product for about month now, but I like how it smells. I cant recommend it and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great toning and moisturizing. Works well in combination, with a moisturizer. I love all the InstaNatural products. Safe even on my 10 year old&#x27;s skin. Will continue buying. Best toner for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I love this toner. It smells great and feels hydrating on my skin. I do have normally oily skin but use anti-aging products that can tend to leave it on the dry side, so I do like this. I don&#x27;t feel any sort of film left behind. It did however remind me what a toner is really for...getting rid of leftover makeup!! Vitamin C generally brightens the skin and makes it appear more glowy and radiant, so when I found a toner that is vitamin C based, I was so excited. I have used up an entire bottle of this toner and I love it. It has little to no harmful ingredients, which is what drew me towards it. All natural pretty much. I always moisturize afterwards. I feel like this does balance my skin a lot, will definitely buy again.i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I believe this product along with the Serum, and eye gel have given my skin a youthful glow. I really enjoyed using all three products together and that they are fusing nature with science to give our skin all it deserves! I did get my items for free for a review but have no issue saying when I do not care for a product! I have done so in the past and would do so again if I feel an item does not meet standards but this product and its accompanying products do that and more. I really have enjoyed the process of getting to know about InstaNatural and I will use them again in the future once these run out.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free to review for my blog.  However, all thoughts are 100% my own.  You may read my full review on my blog, listed on my profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why I was so shocked that this bottle came in spray bottle form.  I am not used to toners being in that form.  Just normally being used with a cotton ball or the like to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You spray it on your face and that is that, you are using your toner to approve the look and feel of your face.  Its one of the easiest and most refreshing toners I have ever used.  It smells amazing as well, which just adds in the enjoyment of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bet if you buy this, you&#x27;d be happy with it.  so just do it!</li>
    <li> I love this toner. It took me a minute to get used to misting my face but once I did I was in love. There is no burning sensation you get from some toners. The smell is fabulous as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m loving the smoothness on my face. My face is very sensitive and I breakout when I try new products. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts with the vitamin C toner. I definitely plan on ordering another bottle!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> My favorite! Not only does is smell amazing, but it leaves my face feeling hydrated and fresh. I. Spray it on after I&#x27;ve washed and dried my face, then let it soak in while I brush my teeth. I follow up with a moisturizer and I&#x27;m done!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had adult acne issues for many years and since I&#x27;ve been using this toner I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in how many pimples I get.</li>
    <li> After using this for just a week, I noticed a huge difference. My skin look smooth and radiant. I had several comments about the glow yo my skin. I am happy to have received this to review. I highly recommend this product and will definitely continue using and add it to my daily routine!</li>
    <li> Great product, works well, smell isn&#x27;t to bad, and dries into the skin fast, and leaving no greasy residue behind!</li>
    <li> This stuff dried out my skin. I have never ever had dry skin on my face.  Was very surprised.</li>
    <li> The only problem I had with this problem is how Amazon shipped it. They put it in a bubble envelope and the lid cracked. It still works, but the delivery was a little messy. When my wife saw this product, her face lit up. I could tell she wanted to try it. What she likes about this Vitamin C Facial Toner is how it cleans her face. The product cleans well and still leaves her face soft. She likes that it is a soft cleaner, that cleans well, but does not irritate. I&#x27;m sure she will find out some more of the benefits of this product the more she uses it. My wife got to try this product for free and she is very thankful she did. We can&#x27;t wait to try more Insta-Natural products. Even I have tried their Vitamin C Serum for some of my own skin problems, but I won&#x27;t tell the guys.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd day of using the product and I&#x27;m loving the effects on my skin. I&#x27;m a very low maintenance type of person and I don&#x27;t put too much stuff on my face but I read somewhere that a facial toner is a must for our skin and vitamin c is great too. :) This was sent to me for testing and to provide honest feedback. I can say this is a great product. :) I have combination skin and overall I have healthy skin but this product made my face even glow more because it tightens the pores. It dries very quickly too once you spray it.</li>
    <li> The ingredients seems good and nature. And it does the job as the toner I want..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But the smell is too strong and it stimulates  my eyes when I use it.</li>
    <li> I really like this. The smell isn&#x27;t bad to me and it wears off quickly. It makes my skin soft and helps with breakouts. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s necessarily worth the price though. So I&#x27;m giving it a three. A decent product just overpriced.</li>
    <li> Smells Great. So fresh and so clean-OutKast!</li>
    <li> Gone are the days of using products with no true benefits.

    <li> This is refreshing and definitely gives my face a brightness.  I&#x27;d honestly use this as a body spray if the scent lasted a bit longer, it smells sooooo good!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received the below products for free for review on \\&quot;Pickles and Peppers\\&quot;. I only recommend products/services I use personally &amp; believe my readers will enjoy and/or benefit from. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s 16 CFR, Part 255: \\&quot;Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think a Vitamin C serum would work so well. I have been pleasantly  surprised by how well it significantly reduced the lines running from my nose to the corners of my mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely a fan of InstaNatural products. This particular one has grown into my staple beauty regiment product! As a person who has oily skin and large pores that you can literally see just looking at my face, this product delivers exactly what it say it will. It not only shrinks pores but it readys my face to receive any follow up product I may use following it, the skin clarifying serum, Vitamin C moisturizer or even an over the counter acne fighting medicine. Since using this product, I no longer get my monthly pimple cluster that shows up on my right cheek. My skin is clear and soft. I am hooked and approaching my third bottle!</li>
    <li> The most refreshing toner I have ever used - plus it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I love this product for its pleasant smell and ease of which to apply. I had a problem with another product of the same company and I was issued a credit with no questions asked and told that I didn&#x27;t even have to return it. That is what I call &#x27;customer service&amp;#34;&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and the seller.</li>
    <li> A different kind of toner - it is sprayed on.  Nice clean scent and it dries quickly.  No problems with it clogging my skin or me breaking out.</li>
    <li> The smell is great ♡ and I see a difference in my skin color more clearer</li>
    <li> LOVE this toner. What drew me to it initially was the Vitamin C. Dr. Oz says that you can actually drop a DECADE from your face by using Vitamin C!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t realize was that it also contains sulfur. Earlier this year I learned about sulfur as a skincare aid. Although I was skeptical at first, sulfur has become one of the hottest skincare trends around and helps cleanse dirt, dead skin cells, and grime that become trapped in pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the Witch Hazel, which is SO gentle. It really helps minimize the size and appearance of pores. (and makes makeup application infinitely easier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product -- I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this toner! I have only had it on twice since yesterday in combination with their Hyaluronic acid serum and eye gel, yet my skin is already showing improvement! My blemish is healing up faster, my skin is soft and taught, and to my surprise my pores especially on my nose, are almost gone.... All that in one days use for me, is a miracle. LOVE this line...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! bought from another account.</li>
    <li> I used this as a non-burning aftershave, and it did perform nicely. My skin looked firmer, and I was able to avoid the Home Alone face that accompanies traditional alcohol based aftershaves. The three star rating is a direct reflection of my perceived value of the product. I found I got the same results with Thayers Rosewater Witch Hazel (which has a shockingly similar ingredient list) for a third of the price.</li>
    <li> This facial toner is very refreshing! Keep my skin glowing, healthy and i often spray them on top of my make up! This is a perfect on the go toner during summer!</li>
    <li> My skin is clearing up. Moisturizes and clears up my skin. Great product. Actually feels wonderful to put on. Light and not greasy just a cool clean mist</li>
    <li> Woks good. I prefer the rose water one, but I will continue to buy it because I like to change my skin care every so often.</li>
    <li> I always enjoy using natural products on my skin. Since our skin is the body’s largest and fastest-growing organ system, we need to take care of what goes on it and then absorbs into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other Vitamin C facial products before and I am sure that each brand has differences that set them apart. The InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Toner has a spray top that can be sprayed directly onto the face, or I like to spray it into my hands and then rub it on my face exactly where I want it to be. It does have a stronger citrus-y smell then another Vitamin C product I have used before, but it is not unpleasant in any way. It dries almost instantly when it hits the skin. It is not oily and does not leave your face feeling wet. It’s almost like giving your face an immediate wake-up call. It feels refreshing and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovely to use first thing in the morning or anytime during the day to freshen your face and ignite your senses. I like this product very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I love that this has a sprayer and I love the way it feels on my face. I appreciate having a toner and this one has Vit C for antiaging and skin clearing, this is an added bonus to nay toner. The scent is a bit strong, but most toners have a strong scent. I also love the vibrant packaging that it has as well! I use this as the first step after my cleansed skin. the sprayer I had did however spray a little off. It would spray top and bottom and seems like the center of the spray was not there. Other than that I really love and use this every day. I received this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
    <li> I got the chance to try Instanatural&#x27;s  Vitamin C Facial Toner for free. I absolutely love their products. They have made my skin look and feel amazing! I love the spray bottle. Other toners that I have used always made me break out. This toner actually does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Recently, I was given the opportunity to review InstaNaturals Vitamin C Toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love toner. It’s a great way to refresh your skin, infuse it with moisture, vitamins, and other needed nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C is needed in the production of collagen, and this toner also contains Aloe Vera, and multiple essential oils that have restorative properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you not familiar with Toner, it’s an awesome product that is sprayed on the skin after cleansing and exfoliating. It’s also a great way to refresh your skin after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A four ounce bottle lasts a few months because you only need 1-2 sprays each time you use it. I have been using my InstaNaturals Vitamin C Toner twice a day. I’m loving how it makes my skin feel plump, moist, and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and I really do like it.  It does have a strong smell, but it isn&#x27;t a bad smell and it goes away pretty quickly.  The only issue I&#x27;ve had is with the way that it sprays.  It doesn&#x27;t have a full spray it is almost like something is clogging it so it sprays the top and bottom of my face.  I just have to spray multiple times and move it up and down.  Not sure if this is by design, but it is a little annoying.  Still love the product itself so not a reason to rate it anything less that 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I like it. It does what it is supposed to do. It&#x27;s refreshing and balances the skin ph.</li>
    <li> This all-in-one hydrator is leaves your skin feeling refreshed like non other! Each pump helps to neutralize free radicals &amp; neutralize the skin (Vitamin C), purify oily skin &amp; tighten pores (Witch Hazel). Better yet, that a toner will actually allow your skin to absorb moisturizers &amp; serums more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was never really big on toners for some reason, but now I couldn&#x27;t imagine my beauty routine without one. I think that&#x27;s mostly because this particular one is in a bottle with a spray pump, vs. one without. And the scent, although slightly orange-y, is also mixed with the antibacterial scent of Tea Tree Oil (one of my favorites!). Let&#x27;s not forget that it really does help my skin absorb moisturizers &amp; serums, reaping the full benefits.</li>
    <li> My new favorite toner. I love it so much. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. It has a pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t make my skin uncomfortably tight.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Facial Toner has made my skin SO SMOOTH!! I used to have super dry and flaky skin (thanks dry California weather), but since trying the Vitamin C Facial Toner, I don&#x27;t even have to use as much moisturizer to achieve smooth and moisturized skin. I LOVE the ease of the use of this product. I admit, some nights I get too lazy to apply 395345092845 products to my face before bed. However, no matter how lazy I am feeling, I am never too lazy to spray 4-5 spritzes of the Vitamin C Toner on my face. It is so simple and takes a few seconds. There is no tingling or burning sensation from using this spray, unlike other toners. I also love the fresh citrus scent of the spray! Another added benefit is that this product is made using 100% ORGANIC and NATURAL ingredients! That makes me feel good about putting the product on my face! Overall, this product gets 5/5 stars from me! My pores are smaller, my skin is smoother, and it works better than the moisturizer I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I love InstaNaturals Vitamin C Facial Toner. As with their other products this toner is free of fillers, binders, or strange chemicals, but is natural and another high quality product. It is a very cost effective product at only $17.75 and so far I have loved the results I have gotten. I absolutely love that it only takes a little and comes in a convenient spray bottle. I generally have an issue with toners leaving my skin dry and taut (in an uncomfortable way), but with InstaNaturals toner I do not have that problem. In fact, my face is left feeling like it is perfectly hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after the first use my face felt tighter (in a good way), less oily (in my T-zone), my pores looked smaller and my face felt cleaner. I was actually amazed at how much my cleanser had missed. I just spray the toner on after I am done washing my face and wipe off the excess with a cotton ball (plus it helps apply it better) and I&#x27;m done. The first couple of times I did that, my cotton ball was dirty afterwards, like I had just applied the toner without cleaning my face. Each day that passes my skin looks and feels healthier, more hydrated, and more toned. I used to have a super oily T-zone ( I have combination skin and finding the right products to keep me from being too oily in that area is difficult) and now it&#x27;s no longer greasy or oily, even mid day or in the evening. Because it takes very little to cover the whole face, it will last a long time and the fact it is affordable and effective makes it a great product to keep on hand. I use this with the InstaNaturals Facial Cleansing Oil, Vitamin C Serum (placed on after), and the moisturizer as well and it&#x27;s the perfect facial care system for my sensitive, combination skin.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with ALL of the InstaNatural products that I have purchased and used so far!!  I am currently using Vitamin C Facial Toner, Moroccan Rose Water, Age-Defying Skin Cleaning Serum, Age-Defying Moisturizer, Emu Oil, Hyaluronic Acid Serum, Argon Oil Hair Mask, Argon Oil, Vitamin C Serum, and Eye Gel.  I have tried countless skin care products from different companies in the past, but I have never been happier since I found InstaNatural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daily facial care routine is:&lt;br /&gt;1) Cleanse - wash my face with organic soap and exfoliate&lt;br /&gt;2) Tone - spray Moroccan Rose Water (morning) / Vitamin C Facial Toner (night)  I also spray these throughout the day to refresh my face.  Both smell great!&lt;br /&gt;3) Serum - apply Hyaluronic Acid Serum (morning) / Age-Defying Skin Cleaning Serum (night)&lt;br /&gt;4) Under Eyes - apply Eye Gel&lt;br /&gt;5) Moisturizer – apply Age-Defying Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair care routine is after washing my hair in the shower, I apply Argon Oil Hair Mask throughout my hair as a deep conditioner/treatment and wash it out at the end of my shower.  I apply Argon Oil and Emu Oil to my dry hair (especially to the ends) whenever my hair gets frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are made of high-quality, predominantly natural and organic ingredients combined with beneficial vitamins and acids. Also of much importance to me, these products do not rely upon preservatives, artificial colors and fragrance to create the illusion of efficacy.  I have found that all InstaNatural products have a pleasant, mild and natural scent and that products absolve into skin and hair without feeling greasy.  The products work great for moisturizing skin and hair without causing any breakouts on my face and body or making my hair flat.  Also, the company provides excellent customer service.  In addition to providing detailed instructions regarding the use of the products, the people I have communicated with are happy to answer any questions.  This company truly cares about customers and is trying their best to make safe and effective products at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Excellent ingredients. Feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> What I like most about this line of skin care products is that they are natural / organic.  Has been very good for my sensitive skin, not at all harsh which even some all natural products can be.  I&#x27;ve recently started using the Vitamin C Facial Toner in addition to the serum and moisturizer and can say that it has helped to balance my skin.  If you have sensitive skin you know that many products can be sticky, or oily, or just lay on top of skin, or burn areas of your skin.  I have had dry patches on my temples as an allergy reaction and had not been able to hydrate enough with just a moisturizer.  The patches are all but gone after adding the toner to my skin care.  I would highly recommend trying InstaNatural if you have sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> very nice facial toner. you can feel it working immediately upon use.</li>
    <li> Recently, I received Insta Naturals Vitamin C Facial Toner in the mail for a product review. I’m a huge fan of skin care products, so I was super excited about trying out something new. Normally, I don’t steer from my usual skin care regime, which is strictly Mary Kay products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vitamin C Facial Toner is known to renew and repair damaged skin. So if you find your skin is somewhat concerning, you could really reap benefits from it’s skin-tightening effects. This Vitamin C Facial Toner has 100% natural and organic ingredients. The vitamin c found in this spray is essential in developing skin youthfulness. This nutrient is what your body needs to produce collagen. When you use this spray after washing your skin, it helps protect against environmental factors. Before applying any products, I applied the Vitamin C Facial Toner to my face because this particular product preps your skin for other applications, giving other products better absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long time, I was looking for a product that had the ability to make my pores look smaller. Until Insta Naturals contacted me for a review, I had no idea that a product like this could come at such an affordable price. During the end of the day my makeup starts to get really oily and what I love about this spray is that it restores your natural pH levels so that your skin tone is balanced. This is great to use towards the afternoon to feel refreshed and make sure your face isn&#x27;t absorbing so much oil.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product. Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I saw a change in my skin right away when I used this toner! I have super oily skin. So oily that when the light shines on it that it reflects the sun and could probably damage your eyesite! Ok, maybe not that oily but that&#x27;s how I feel. One day of use and I noticed a huge difference! It helps keeps my skin moisturized and not as oily. I love it! I&#x27;m grateful I was given the opportunity to review this product. Oh, did I mention witch hazel? That should be enough reason to buy it. I love with hazel!</li>
    <li> I really like this toner.  I smells like I sliced into a fresh orange.  I don&#x27;t follow the package instructions though.  I spray it on my face and use my fingertips to spread it around.  The reason why?  The bottle is not as ample as I thought it would be and I don&#x27;t want to waste any of it.  I just let it dry on my face and neck while I do other things in my routine.  My face feels tighter and my pores are less visible.  For the price, however, I wish there was more of it.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is a nice size. Big enough to last a long time and the perfect size to put into your purse. I don&#x27;t have oily skin so it doesn&#x27;t help me combat that problem but I think it&#x27;s great for any skin type. Since I&#x27;ve started using it I have smaller pores and I have a glow to my skin and it leaves my face silky soft. Such a refreshing feeling! Another great product by InstaNatural!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to add to your beauty routine - use this toner to help your skin become more receptive to serums and moisturizers -  A great product for your skin and also to delay aging in your skin - we all age but a product like this helps your skin to absorb anti-aging products so your skin looks and feels younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try - you only have a few years to lose or in this case to gain!!!</li>
    <li> Fresh &amp; love the citrus smell! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s advised, but think it would be great to put in the refrigerator and have a cool mist?</li>
    <li> bought it for my mom and she loves it! told me she already bought another bottle!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product! I love it ! Just perfect for me and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
    <li> Love this product, really tightened my poors, with out feeling like it was drying out my skin. Very refreshing, specially on these hot summer days.</li>
    <li> It smells really good. And clean my skin really deeply. After using it my skin always feels so smooth and clean. Sometimes, I use it in morning instead of a face wash if I am in a hurry. Excellent product for skin.</li>
    <li> This toner is amazing and it smells great. It helps keep my skin from getting too oily, but helps keep it moisturized. I am so far very pleased with this product. This spray bottle gives too great of a spray arch, but it is only a minor annoyance and does not detract from the quality of this toner.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel clean &amp; refreshed, love it, love it love it !!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Leaves my skin soft and smooth. It&#x27;s definitely balancing ou my skin. Would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received this toner for reviewing purposes. When I apply this onto my face I feel it refresh my face. It smells amazing and reminds me of roses for some reason. The toner dries immediately and leaves my skin glowing. I apply this toner under my makeup and also use it as a setting spray by spritzing a little on my makeup . Honestly, you could use this toner by spraying it on a cotton ball and spreading it across your face, or you could do what I do on lazy days: Spray some toner on your hands and rub your hands across your face. I have combination skin; my t-zone and nose is oily and the rest of my face is pretty much dry. Even with this fact this toner does not dry out my face or seem to clog my pores. My pores actually appear to have shrunken. I am very satisfied with this product and how it leaves my skin feeling. This toner is great!</li>
    <li> Not my favorite thing. it stings my face actually</li>
    <li> Insta- Natural Pore Tightening Vitamin C Facial Toner is an in one hydrator infused with age- defying ingredients to leave your skin refreshed and balanced with each pump of its formula. This product has help renew my skin by neutralizing free radicals and UV-related damage. I can feel the difference in my skin. My pore were definitely tightened from using this product and to me I notice my skin looks much more healthier. My pores are actually visibly smaller, which is a huge deal to me. Here’s how it works: When pores are clogged, they appear bigger, because they are easier to spot. This toner contains powerful astringents like Witch Hazel and Tea Tree Oil, which purify your skin by cleaning and tightening pores, shrinking their appearance. I also have oily skin, and this toner works to combat and remove excess oil, while restoring your natural pH levels so your skin is balanced.</li>
    <li> Great product and love the bright packaging</li>
    <li> I used to use Vitamin C products all the time before I got pregnant. Vitamin C serums completely changed the texture and look of my complexion. It smoothed out my skin and got rid of a lot of the visible scarring. What I like about this product is that it is a toner. I like to use toners on my face but this is the first kind that I used that has Vitamin C, sulfur, and witch hazel mixed in it. It didn&#x27;t sting or make my skin to dry. I have tried a couple of toners in the past that were too strong and harsh against my skin. Previous toners, would leave my skin dry and a little itchy. It didn&#x27;t smell like much either.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it comes in a spray bottle instead of one that just pours out. I&#x27;m a little clumsy. I drop things, I spill things from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;This was not the case with Instantural&#x27;s Toner. In fact, my face felt nicely moisturized afterward. It prepares your skin for any additional serums, creams, etc. that you are going to apply to your skin. I like the way that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a complimentary bottle from Instanatural since I blog and review products regularly. All of the opinions here are based off of my own experience and in no way influenced.</li>
    <li> I could go on and on, seriously about how great InstaNatural products are. I Love this toner. It helps to keep my skin moisturized through the day and i love the refreshing scent. On top of what an awesome product it is, the people of InstaNatural are amazing! Not only should this be your new toner but you should look into the many other beauty products they provide. So far, they have ALL been amazing!</li>
    <li> Contains colloidal silver known for causing argyria.</li>
    <li> Everything about the product seems great so far. Have been using for two weeks and don&#x27;t feel it dries out the skin like some other products. Customer service is also great.</li>
    <li> Aside from what it does for my face, I think it kept me from getting any colds in the last year.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating for skin after shower. Don&#x27;t care for the scent though.</li>
    <li> This is the best line of skin care. This is my first time trying this skin care line and i love it. My skin looks healthier after the first week. I will continue to buy this line of skin care without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Light, refreshing, cool,energizing to the skin. I have not found any of InstaNatural product not worthy to review and continue to use. I am glad that I was selected to review. You won&#x27;t be sorry with any product.</li>
    <li> The toner has made my pores smaller and I love the citrus smell.  I can tell on days that I don&#x27;t use it as my skin isn&#x27;t has tight as on days I do.</li>
    <li> Honestly this is my favorite smell of all the products I have from this wonderful company. It lifts my mood while hydrating, toning and tightening my skin. It make the perfect primer for all the product I put on after I tone. I love the pump in it as well! I also like spraying my face in the morning then applying my daytime products even if its on top of the night time products the tones really freshens up my skin when I am in a rush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over the awful smell. I tried it once and then it&#x27; sitting in the back of my bathroom cabinet. Too bad. I liked the product description and hoped to like this product...</li>
    <li> This is one of the best toner I ever used. I have normal to dry skin so I use a moisturizer(cream) after applying this toner. Also, you can use any time that you want since dry fast. The citrus smell do not bother me, I think even the smell is refreshing. I can see a little improvement on my skin already, however I will have to be more discipline and use every day to see the differences. Also, I have to mentioned the customer service which is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Smells so fresh and feels clean going on.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this for the past month morning and night, i don&#x27;t see a noticeable difference between this and my neutrogena toner. I guess the only advantage is that this product is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; whatever that truly means.</li>
    <li> Only reason I did not give five stars is because of the spray I feel like I use more than necessary to make sure I sprayed all parts of my face. Other wise I really love this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It helps tremendously with cutting down the oil and shine on my face.  In fact, it works so well that I have cut down to using it every other day.</li>
    <li> Visible difference after aprox  2 weeks . I am also using your moisturizer. Great smell . I have tried other products and did not get any results.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with results . I will buy again</li>
    <li> Nice product.  I use this after the oil facial cleanser and my skin glows! I like the spray bottle for application it really wakes me up in the morning.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and can feel the tightening immediately</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this Vitamin C Facial Toner by InstaNatural via Tomoson and I’m surprised that I like it because I don’t use sprays like this. It does a good job as a moisturizer and I have been using it as such instead of using my regular facial moisturizer. It’s very refreshing, whether you use it after a shower or not, and you can use as little or as much as you want on your face at a time without having to worry about it being thick and heavy or oily. It does have a light scent to it, but it’s not displeasing. Overall, I’m pretty sure I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> what an amazing toner i use this right after i wash my face in the morning and put on my makeup just to brighten my face, it has been a pure gem not only does it take away the redness on my face from my psoriasis it makes my skin beautifully even in one or two sprays! i love the smell but be careful not to get it on your lips goodness the taste, my advise put on chap stick before spraying this on your face then wipe the chap stick off, other than that i will be buying this you can bet on that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Today I received the InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Toner Free of Charge for my Honest Review.  The InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Toner has a Wonderful Citrus scent and it sprays on so lightly I really Love it and it&#x27;s so easy to use this way. My skin looks a little more hydrated and it feels softer now that I have applied the Toner. The Vitamin C Toner contains 100% natural and organic ingredients like Witch Hazel and Aloe Vera, MSN and Tea Tree oil and others. The Vitamin C Toner will Shrink Pores and Clean your face and Remove excess oils as it works as and antioxidant. I highly recommend the InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Toner.  Thank you, Jerri Davis</li>
    <li> I use this every night after washing my face.  It has a nice clean smell and cools my facial redness down.  I think it is a nice toner and gives my face those vitamins it needs.</li>
    <li> This toner has a seemingly pleasant citrus smell until you spray it in your face and then it is instantly overwhelming and hard to breath. You&#x27;ll instantly start waving your hands around to fan the smell away or start dabbing at it with something in hopes that it will help with the smell. It doesn&#x27;t. The good news is that the smell diminishes once it&#x27;s absorbed... either that or your temporarily lose your sense of smell. Either way, you stop smelling it soon after spraying it on your face. I have no idea what everyone else is talking about when their reviews say the smell is pleasant and refreshing. I&#x27;m not going to lie to you. It is completely awful once you spray it. Just a heads up for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have that out of the way, I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this toner. There&#x27;s so much good about this product that the eye watering smell can&#x27;t even diminish my 5 star review. I love InstaNatural products and I think this is one of my favorite products of all time. This instantly tightened my pores. It did not just reduce the appearance of my pores, my pores instantly snapped shut tighter than they&#x27;ve been since I was 20 years old. My skin looked at least 5 years younger after just using this ONCE. After using it for just over a week, my skin has a more even tone and looks healthier. I&#x27;m excited to see if my skin will continue to improve over time with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really notice any real moisturizing from this product, but I have noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t as oily. Over the years I&#x27;ve developed an oily T-zone and I&#x27;m happy to say that its almost entirely gone. The only time I notice any oil is if I don&#x27;t use this vitamin C toner before I go to bed, and even then it is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other really great things about this is that it comes in a good sized bottle that will last a really long time. So not only does it work great, its also a great value. If you have oily skin, large pores, or want a toner that improves your skin and skin health, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
    <li> My skin looks more even and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product works as they claims... I just couldn&#x27;t stand the awful, fake citrus smell - I returned it...</li>
    <li> Good product. Got this free. Was nice at minimizing my pores</li>
    <li> I have never used toners before so I was excited to get this. Pros:  it def helps with oil and improves skin. Cons: I didn&#x27;t love the smell and didn&#x27;t love that it came in a spray bottle. To read a full review you can check it out here : http://leopardlaceandcheesecake.blogspot.com/2015/02/review-instanatural-dead-sea-mud-mask.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I recieved this product for testing and review purposes from BrandBacker</li>
    <li> A great surprise how much this works!  Great addition to my repertoire of skin care.</li>
    <li> I love this as well. My skins feels great, and taught after use.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a week, skin texture is better and seems to help me</li>
    <li> This product smells so lovely and refreshing, like rose petals.  Makes my skin feel pampered and refreshed</li>
    <li> I have huge pores on my chin and around my nose and its hard to find products that help and don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. InstaNaturals vitamin C toner has really helped me. It is not as harsh as other toners I have tried. It cleans and shrinks my pores without over drying my skin. It leaves my face feeling refreshes and smooth. I received to review and will be purchasing and recommending to others.</li>
    <li> This facial toner is one of the good ones. It doesn&#x27;t sting as some toners can. The scent is pleasant -- like lemons -- which reminds me of a spa I like to go to for massages. It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like other toners. Insta Natural hit a home run with this one.</li>
    <li> This really makes my face feel refreshed. I have been using this product for several weeks now and have notice that my face is really clearing up.</li>
    <li> I love this facial toner, I have been using it with my other instanatural products. It makes my face feel refreshed and wonderful. I love this product and will continue to use it with my other products. I will update when I have been using long enough to have visible results.</li>
    <li> good product easy absorb</li>
    <li> I use it in the morning.  This toner make me feel refresh!</li>
    <li> Really nice product.  I use a toner before my vitamin c serum and was using the proactive product.  This is so refreshing and absorbs so quickly.  I will be ordering again and again.</li>
    <li> Good toner.  I use it after washing and b4 i apply my moisturizer.  Cleans the skin. No noticeable changes in my pores. Got it at a reduce price for my review</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel very refreshed! I love this stuff! I am currently using all the Instanaturals products. Almost every ingredient is organic. I love this company!</li>
    <li> I really like this toner and how it hydrates my skin. Winter time, my skin gets so dry and this has given me good hydration. The mist feels so refreshing on my face. Easy to use. Has a pleasant smell as well. I do recomment this.</li>
    <li> Put mine in the fridge for that extra refreshing feeling. I spray it on before applying my other products.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:d90edc087b2f4ab0ea3f96e16dc42465]] This toner is very light and gentle.  Excellent for oily skin.  Has an extremely sharp and bright burst of citrus scent when you spray it which is very refreshing.  They recommend that you keep in in the refrigerator and then the coolness of the spray combined with the bright citrus scent would be a true delight.  I will take their word for it because I&#x27;m too lazy to keep this in the fridge and walk all the way over to the kitchen to retrieve and return my toner.  For those of you fancy people who have a mini fridge in your bathroom for your wine and makeup products - throw this product in there as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Light and airy - great burst of citrus smell&lt;br /&gt;2.  Leaves no residue, leaves skin feeling fresh&lt;br /&gt;3.  Very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feel&lt;br /&gt;4.  Gentle - no stinging&lt;br /&gt;5.  Effective - helps to lighten skin and minimize pores - especially when used in a skin care regimen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply this onto your face after washing it thoroughly.  Don&#x27;t wipe dry - put on your serum or moisturizer product directly afterwards so it can help seal in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the spray bottle sprays funny.  I show this in my video.  It sprays in a sort of half arc - or a splattery ring with some splotches in the middle.  It&#x27;s hard to aim and doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.  I may just have a defective bottle.  Not a big deal, I just spray on my hand instead.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of spraying it directly on my face anyways, it makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been a bad dog and needs to be punished.  I&#x27;m still giving this 5 stars because it&#x27;s just a minor issue and doesn&#x27;t really affect anything.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday I love the way it feels it&#x27;s so refreshing and it made my face feel really fresh and clean</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this. I was worried about it being a spray instead of a liquid to put on a cotten ball. It turns out that I really like it.</li>
    <li> I have noticed my pores have decreased in size and my skin feels slightly tighter after using this for a week.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products that I have found lately.  It is light and fresh smelling.  It absorbs right into my skin with no oily residue.  I feel like my makeup goes on smoother as well when I apply this before my normal moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love the freshness this adds to my face....</li>
    <li> I love that this toner is in a spray bottle. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I used this product before putting on my make-up. My pores were visibly smaller. Great product!</li>
    <li> Soaks in well, easier to use than a serum.  Obvious effects.</li>
    <li> I use this right after I wash my face. I have never used a toner before but now I&#x27;m hooked! I would recommend this one highly.</li>
    <li> Great toner leaves my face fresh</li>
    <li> Dries your skin out really bad!</li>
    <li> I bought this toner based off seeing all the &#x27;positive&#x27; reviews. After I received the product, I read the reviews more closely and realized that almost ALL of the reviews were from &#x27;people&#x27; who received this toner for free! Not only does that influence how someone rates a product but the amount of fake reviews bumps this up to the number one spot on Amazon, beating out other products that actually work and are not abusing amazon&#x27;s star review system. I am completely disappointed that amazon allows this to happen. Not only does this toner smell plastic and fake (contradicts the name of the company, INSTANATURAL) but it does absolutely nothing. Waste of Money. This is a REAL REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely love this it sets m by y Makeup &amp; gives me a dewy glow. I also use without Makeup it makes my skin feel fresh &amp; it gives it a nice glow.. I highly recommend this product.. I too will be repurchasing</li>
    <li> I love this toner.  Makes my face feel so moist.</li>
    <li> I have been working on finding the perfect products and combinations for my skin. I have never used a toner before, but have been hearing and reading more and more about toner being used prior to serums and moisturizers. I have been very satisfied with InstaNatural&#x27;s other products, both in quality and guaranty- so I thought this would be the toner to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed, and can&#x27;t believe that I haven&#x27;t used a toner before now. This works and feels great on my skin, and works wonderfully with the rest of InstaNatural&#x27;s line of products (as well as other serums and moisturizers). The ingredients are perfect for what the product is for- Witch Hazel and Tea Tree Oil are wonderful for pore cleansing and thus minimization. It does help keep oily skin under control- I &#x27;suffer&#x27; from the T zone- and this toner definitely helps keep the shine away longer. I have been using this toner for months now, and am still on my first bottle! My pores are definitely less noticeable, and my skin firmer.</li>
    <li> Love this toner. My skin feels so soft and clean after using!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review for my blog and my skin is so smooth and refreshed! It&#x27;s so easy to apply, just spray on, and smells so wonderful!</li>
    <li> The lite mist covers your face with a refreshing feel. It&#x27;s perfect after cleansing and nice before adding my eye gel &amp; Vitamin C Serum. You won&#x27;t want to wash your face without it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, works great on my oily skin.  I leave it in the fridge as recommended  and it makes for an invigorating part of morning ritual.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. It brightens my skin and leaves it feeling refreshed. My cap had a weird issue and the customer service was great and they helped me immediately. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This toner is just WONDERFUL. It leaves my face feeling so fresh!  I have been using it for the past month, and I have noticed a decrease in the size of my pores too. The smell is really wonderful, plus it&#x27;s made with all natural and organic ingredients. I think this is an all-time favorite, and I feel so grateful that I was sent it for review!</li>
    <li> I love using this. My new favorite toner to use daily. It has a scent of orange which sort of sticks around for a bit. It makes my face feel smoother and plumper</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. It smells amazing first of all. Everytime i spray this on my face anyone around me is just sniffing the air like what did I spray. Another reason I love this is, it has vitamin C in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we all know anything about Vitamin C, we know that it just does wonders for the skin. Vitamin C is great for collagen boosting and has antioxidant that rejuvenates skin.This toner makes your skin feel smooth and soft just as you apply it to skin. It’s quick and fast. Just spray on face and neck before applying anything. You can use your fingers or cotton ball to help absorb it into skin faster but either way I just spray it and give about 15 to 30 seconds and it dries rather quickly. Afterwards use your moisturizer and continue with your daily regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner hydrates and tones your skin prepping it daily for the rest of the day. According to the company “the sulfur in each spray will drive deep down to penetrate your skin and increase elasticity to maximize results. At the same time, the Witch Hazel present in the toner will gently purify your skin and pores, even helping to reduce their size and appearance.”</li>
    <li> I really love this toner it works really well to close large pores and it smells nice and fresh its easy to use in the spray bottle and it a very complete anti aging toner for everyday use . it is not drying and is a pleasure to use #toner #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received the Vitamin C Facial Toner completely free to review through Tomoson and Instanatural.  I really like this product.  Great way to tone and hydrate your skin.  I have used this product for about a month now and my skin feels refreshed and rejuvenated.  It has made my pores smaller.  Love this product and will be continuing to use it to see even more results and to keep my skin feeling young again.</li>
    <li> Just had this product for less then a week. I used to have oily skin and had to use oil blotting papers many times a day. This toner has shown its power on the first day of use! It won&#x27;t make my skin dry but my skin produces much less oil throughout the day! So far so good and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Wooow i like it , i used it remove the blackhead from my nose is very very useful</li>
    <li> great scent when sprayed...very refreshing feel.  grabs the dirt and oil in the pores and prepares the face for the day (or night).  I love this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I started using it a week ago, so i cant give a full rating as yet only time will tell.</li>
    <li> From the first time I tried it, I can already feel and see a difference. After I sprayed on my clean face and let dry, I noticed my face looking more taut and my pores looks smaller. My foundation applied smoother and I can tell my face looked brighter with it... Will definitely keep using.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toner!! I appreciate the fact that it&#x27;s in the form of a spray bottle. I spray it onto my face, then with clean fingers I use circular motions to massage it into the skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now, and can tell a difference in my complexion. My face seems brighter, smoother, and my pores do appear to be smaller. I enjoy the citrusy smell, it&#x27;s very fresh and pleasant. I use this toner with Instanaturals vitamin C serum followed by a retinol moisturizer. I believe this toner would be a very good addition to any skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I had originally only used Apple Cider Vinegar as a toner and when my skin routine plateaued I began looking for a new toner. I came across this toner and seeing all the positive reviews and ingredients, I knew I had to try it. Let me tell you guys, this stuff is amazing just as all the reviews suggest! My skin instantly perked up after just 2 days of using morning and night. My skin has had fewer breakouts, has been less oily, and the tone and texture is SO even! I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all! I&#x27;ve even recommended it to my mother and sister and they are both loving the results!</li>
    <li> Convenient to use from a spray bottle. Skin feels refreshed and moist. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and I have to be careful which products I use or more often than not, I&#x27;ll  break out in a flaky itchy rash.  This toner feels nice on my skin and dries so quickly leaving me with noticeably smaller pores and tighter skin. Also I bought this product while going through one of the worst breakouts I have had since high school,  and after combining this and a regular foaming face soap,  my skin dramatically improved and quick.  It&#x27;s been around 2 months since I started using this toner  and my skin is still getting better every day.  It might not work for everyone like it has me,  but it is definitely worth a shot.</li>
    <li> (I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial toners has been my thing ever since I got serious with my skincare ritual. I highly prioritize it and InstaNatural never failed in that category. At first, it was oily and hard to swipe on my face, but then when you shake it thoroughly it gives the formula time to infuse. It is refreshing and I love the citrus smell. It cleanses any makeup residue completely and refreshes my tired skin both in the morning and evening or whenever I feel like using it. Also it is pore tightening so it helps in smoothing out skin before applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for. I was so impressed with there professionalism, and the eager to go over and beyond to make sure that I was a satisfied customer, that I just had to apply for all of there products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Excellent customer service is KEY! that will only reflect even more on their products.  It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  From their skin care, to hair care and body Insta Natural is by far my favorite company.  Their products are amazing.  Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  I have seen a big difference in the look of my skin and my hair.  Insta Natural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give Insta Natural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  I look forward to continue to do business with Insta Natural.  I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
    <li> This toner seems to do a great job of toning and refining pores, but the smell is not great.  I haven&#x27;t decided yet if the pros outweigh the unpleasant smell.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> Amazing. It does tighten the skin. It balances the pH of the skin preparing it for the application of the Serums and Moisturizers. I  love this and I have already ordered my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free to try and I wanted to love it. Straight from opening the package I was impressed with quality of the heavy solid plastic spray bottle.  First I do want to say that after applying within a few minutes I experienced a lovely cooling effect followed by the feeling of skin tightening. But the first thing I noticed as I applied was a strong sulfa odor. Nothing refreshing or pleasant there. After an hour the smell still strong I had to wash the product off. I would give 1 star for odor but 5 for the cooling and tightening so I settled with 3. If the smell doesnt faze you then it could be perfect, I personally couldnt stomach it. It literally left me a little sickend by the smell. But that is just me. I wonder if an EO could be added to make it more pleasant. Then it would be a 5star rating from me. Update - been using it a little longer the smell still unpleasant and yes others can smell it but seems to me that I have become used to the smell and use it about twice a day. Havent seen any other long term difference in skin . Will update again.</li>
    <li> This was the first spray based product for me and found it pretty comfortable. It is very handy to apply any time so I bring it with me wherever I go.</li>
    <li> I love the way that it sprays on very evenly and its light citrus odor is pleasant, and not overpowering. It contains two ingredients that I have heard about being very good for skin health and tone, Witch Hazel and Tea Tree Oil. The fact is that they ARE very good for your skin, especially in a dry climate. It feels like my skin is cleaner, fresher, and tighter after using this spray. It really does seen that my pores are smaller, wow I really did not expect that to be true but it is. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a good toner it remove my acne. I likely to recommend this. As it work better to your face</li>
    <li> So refreshing!  Great communication from the seller.</li>
    <li> leaves face feeling refreshed and clean</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong. I love the stuff I&#x27;ve tried from this company but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
    <li> I love the citrus fresh feeling this toner gives my skin! It cleanses without drying out my skin. I love all InstaNatural products, definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> The smell is too strong and smells like bug spray but otherwise I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/16/2015&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to the smell and now I kind of like it! I use this as a cleanser to take my eye makeup off and refresh my skin in the morning. It is gentle and leaves my skin looking great. I can never do without this product!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Shipped on time.</li>
