      <li>I&#x27;ve loved Tatiana for many years and didn&#x27;t think it could be surpassed.  </li>
      <li>so her compliments are her own.  </li>
      <li>The best part is that when I spray Diane lightly in my hair before bed, my husband NEVER fails to tell me how good I smell as his face brushes my hair.  </li>
      <li>I feel regal and confident when wearing it.</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t have more words to say.</li>
      <li>I got it by fluke one time at a discount store for under $10.00 and fell I love with it.</li>
      <li>After more weeks of wearing it, a coworker and a cousin asked if I could order them each a bottle from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I did and they are as pleased as I am with the scent</li>
      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>Was more like a combo of chemicals and soap.</li>
      <li>Why does one love a perfume?  </li>
      <li>The scent is fresh, clean, bright, woodsy and just lovely to be around.  </li>
      <li>Lovely light daytime fragrance.</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d bought them all, because TJ was selling them at a huge discount.</li>
      <li>Been looking for Diane Von Furstenberg Eau De Parfum for a long time at a Discounted price, well AMAZON saves the day again, I got 3.3 ounces for a GREAT price and will tell all my friends about my deal and recommend Amazon a the place to purchase it.  </li>
      <li>I bought it originally at TJMax at a sale, just to try it out.</li>
      <li>After reading reviews about men noticing the scent and finding it pleasant enough to comment on, I wanted to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>So yes I recommend this DVF scent it is so different and unique in a good way.</li>
      <li>This is a classic, sexy scent with floral notes and a musky undertone that smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume so much I had to order it again.</li>
      <li>I love this scent - and so does anyone who comes near me!</li>
      <li>Always comments &amp;#34;What is that gorgeous perfume?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;You smell just lovely.&amp;#34; I have worn various perfumes throughout my many years of life, but this is the only one that has garnered consistent compliments.</li>
      <li>It arrived promptly, sealed original packaging, and my nose tells me it is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I recieved it all right.</li>
      <li>Two friends are going to order this right away, because of the price and fast delivery and of course my recommendation!  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest staying power, so you will need to reapply throughout the day in order to maintain the fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is clean, soft and does not knock you over.    </li>
      <li>It is, indeed, the real deal.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>a real bargain for the money.</li>
      <li>thanks you.</li>
      <li>It is my new signature scent!</li>
      <li>Still, the price of this bottle through this provider was pretty reasonable, and the scent is the same, so this seems to be a &amp;#34;genuine&amp;#34; product, and not a knock off.</li>
      <li>Clean smelling, last long.</li>
      <li>When I used Diane at work for the very 1st time, I received several compliments.  </li>
      <li>I save my other scents for my special time spent with my husband....</li>
      <li>I was concerned that this perfume would not be the real deal, due to the price.</li>

<li> Let&#x27;s keep this Von Furstenberg product a secret.......</li>
<li> Surprisingly disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Lovely light daytime fragrance. I love it.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s smalling so good</li>
    <li> I love this scent - and so does anyone who comes near me! Always comments &amp;#34;What is that gorgeous perfume?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;You smell just lovely.&amp;#34; I have worn various perfumes throughout my many years of life, but this is the only one that has garnered consistent compliments. The scent is fresh, clean, bright, woodsy and just lovely to be around.  I bought it originally at TJMax at a sale, just to try it out.

    <li> I bought my 1st bottle of Diane several months ago.  After reading reviews about men noticing the scent and finding it pleasant enough to comment on, I wanted to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve loved Tatiana for many years and didn&#x27;t think it could be surpassed.  When I used Diane at work for the very 1st time, I received several compliments.  After more weeks of wearing it, a coworker and a cousin asked if I could order them each a bottle from Amazon.  I did and they are as pleased as I am with the scent and they get compliments as well.  The coworker doesn&#x27;t work in the same department so our scent is not being noticed by the same people.  My cousin doesn&#x27;t work where I do so her compliments are her own.  The best part is that when I spray Diane lightly in my hair before bed, my husband NEVER fails to tell me how good I smell as his face brushes my hair.  We&#x27;re in our 60&#x27;s and he still notices something as unique as Diane!!!  It&#x27;s subtle but &#x27;there&#x27; all day.  Let&#x27;s keep this Von Furstenberg product a secret.......</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!!!! Great price too!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Received on time!!!!!</li>
    <li> Why does one love a perfume?  It just fits me.  It is clean, soft and does not knock you over.    9-14  third bottle on the way.  I adore this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a classic, sexy scent with floral notes and a musky undertone that smells fantastic. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest staying power, so you will need to reapply throughout the day in order to maintain the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that this perfume would not be the real deal, due to the price. It is, indeed, the real deal. The fragrance lasts all day!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Not overpowering. Have retired some of my other favorites  to make this my signature scent.  Good buy at this price.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume so much I had to order it again. I got it by fluke one time at a discount store for under $10.00 and fell I love with it. Needless to say I can&#x27;t find it again at that very very steal of a price I wear it daily for my Goto work perfume and get lots of compliments on it. I save my other scents for my special time spent with my husband.... The perfumes he has purchased for me and they are the ones he loves. So yes I recommend this DVF scent it is so different and unique in a good way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume!  I always get tons of compliments when I wear it.  It is my new signature scent!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly disappointed.  I do not get the sunflower inspiration at all.  Was more like a combo of chemicals and soap.</li>
    <li> it is a good product. I recieved it all right. i don&#x27;t have more words to say. thanks you. ok</li>
    <li> I love this scent. I was a little bit worried about originality of this product because of the surprisingly low price. It arrived promptly, sealed original packaging, and my nose tells me it is the real deal. a real bargain for the money.</li>
