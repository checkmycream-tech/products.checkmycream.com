      <li>, i hope alter ego makes more hair products like a leave in watery type of spray</li>

      <li>I am a garlic lover and impressed that this alter ego doesnt smell like garlic both products the shampoo and the deep conditioner, it has a sweet floral fruity scent, and for the price here at amazon the combo price is very reasonable, plus they promise you the day it will arrive, very good company, my hair products came in one piece sealed well, and packed well, this hair products made my hair manageably soft and shiney, and healthy looking</li>
      <li>Works just fine.</li>
      <li>but I gave it 5 stars because the containers are huge</li>
      <li>Its a great product so far no complaint</li>
      <li>It leaves my super clean and moisture.</li>
      <li>I finally came to amazon.com and found a good product that works for my hair.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and intact (without spillage or cracks).  </li>
      <li>Shipping was quick thank you</li>
      <li>Find the right product to keep your hair moiturize and healthy is a real piece of work.</li>

      <li>, there products are super fantastic, i plan to purchase next there linseed oil shampoo and conditioner, thank you amazon for EXCELLENT customer shipments, and THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH For the other company who works with amazon in supplying the products, i think they are called UglynBeauty...</li>
      <li>I love this stuff it has made my hair so soft and sleek.  </li>
      <li>The seller was very fast.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t come with the hot oil treatment as stated on the item description/title.  </li>
      <li>I will be back:)</li>
      <li>It felt equivalent to Brillo, used to scrub cast iron pots, but just after one use of this combo I was set free and the tangles were unlocked easily by hand with minimal breakage.</li>
      <li>Black woman hair are very challenging to take care.</li>
      <li>I really like the hot oil treatment.</li>
      <li>It works really well alone or with the conditioner.</li>

      <li>It really helps after sweating a lot after the gym.</li>
      <li>I really like the way my hair feels after using this product.</li>

      <li>The shampoo is super gentle and the deep conditioner really smooths my very curly and coily hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a african American with very fine hair that is thinning out</li>
      <li>Makes my relaxed hair really soft and detangles it very well.</li>
      <li>is nice and creamy and thick</li>
      <li>The conditioner leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>but i hope that who ever that try this alter ego shampoo and hot oil treatment have the same result as i do .My</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m natural!</li>
      <li>Leaves new growth soft and managable...</li>
      <li>I never knew my hair could be so soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>SO FAR.</li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
      <li>I received the product and it cleaned my hair just fine , but I notice once I finished shampooing that my ends where tangled in balls and the only way to untangle was to comb through which of course, made my already fragile and thin hair break.</li>

    <li> I have my hair dresser use this product on my hair which is thinning and breaking. I am hoping for improvement and to continue using of this brand.</li>
    <li> The best for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and treatment I&#x27;ve utilized.  I have a texturizer and it keeps my hair soft, manageable, and most importantly healthy!!  It arrived quickly and intact (without spillage or cracks).  II found a better deal for both on Amazon then at the beauty supply stores in NY.  I am a happy camper;;;No complaints.</li>
    <li> Makes my relaxed hair really soft and detangles it very well. I love my hair now and I been using it for the pass two mouths and don&#x27;t want nothing else since its o&lt;br /&gt;Hot I wash my hair every other week</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;m a african American with very fine hair that is thinning out and I&#x27;m natural! I received the product and it cleaned my hair just fine , but I notice once I finished shampooing that my ends where tangled in balls and the only way to untangle was to comb through which of course, made my already fragile and thin hair break. I don&#x27;t understand!  Then I shampoo with another shampoo and no knots or tangled ends!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very displeased! So two stars because my hair was cleaned with this shampoo ,but if I continue to use it, I won&#x27;t have any hair for the broken split ends. Did anyone else experience this?</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t come with the hot oil treatment as stated on the item description/title.  I only received the garlic shampoo.  Very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> OMG! Shipping was quick thank you so much!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Items as described, great service and I LOVE these products. I will be back:)</li>
    <li> The shampoo is super gentle and the deep conditioner really smooths my very curly and coily hair. It really helps after sweating a lot after the gym. The products smell very lovely as well.</li>
    <li> I really like the hot oil treatment. The shampoo makes your hair feel very hard and ruff but after you put the treatment on it feels much better.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my hair feel, as if I got a wig:) great product!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best. It doesn&#x27;t at all smell like garlic.... My hair has been softer any since I have a perm and I&#x27;m in the mist of growing it out the conditionar is nice and creamy and thick I love this product</li>
    <li> I love this product and I like I was able to order it from this website. have been using it for a long time</li>
    <li> Smells like flex shampoo ( if you remember it). Works great for shedding but not so much for frizz or dryness. I am very happy that it did reduce the amount of hair I was shedding! It&#x27;s just ok but I gave it 5 stars because the containers are huge and I&#x27;m shedding less.</li>
    <li> I really like the way my hair feels after using this product. It is a lot easier to manage; especially after the treatment which I do once every other week. It does have a nice smell.  However, there is no significant change in the amount of hair I shed and I did notice that my hair is frizzy now. I have been using this for a few months in addition to other brand products. But I&#x27;ll start using it exclusively and do the treatment every week in addition to the serum I just ordered and see if there is improvement. Saty tuned.</li>
    <li> Its a great product so far no complaint</li>
    <li> Amazed by this product. I have been searching for a good shampoo and conditioner for a while, came across this and read the reviews. The shampoo and conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic. It leaves my super clean and moisture. I have less hair falling out after using this. It&#x27;s on the pricey side but my hair deserves the best. I&#x27;m just over bss hair products. The seller was very fast. No issues</li>
    <li> I love it. Leaves new growth soft and managable... I use it with kanechom karite butter as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great smell and leaves hair frizzless. Love this treatment. Good for my hair.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is great for softening and moisturizing, but my hair is still coming out.  The shedding has increased, but the product has restore some of the listlessness that it had before.  It just doesn&#x27;t do anything for the shedding.</li>
    <li> This set was very good for my hair</li>
    <li> Product is awesome!!! My is soft, scalp not itching hair smells good!!!! Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Awesome great I recommend for sure get it!!!</li>
    <li> i purchased this product for my wife after hearing her talk about it over an over.since she received it i am constantly thanked for gietting for her.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Great price</li>
    <li> I LOVE BOTH OF THESE PRODUCTS, I&#x27;VE USED THEM TWICE SO FAR. I WASH MY HAIR ONCE A WEEK BUT I WANNA WASH IT MORE BECAUSE I LOVE HOW MY HAIR FEELS AND LOOKS AFTERWARDS! MY HAIR LOOKS HEALTHIER. I JUST ORDERED THE NEQUAL INTENSIVE ENERGIZING LOTION AND I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO GET IT AND USE IT! ALTER EGO IS THE BEST SO FAR AND I PLAN ON TRYING MANY MORE OF THEIR PRODUCTS! YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET BUYING THE SHAMPOO OR HOT OIL MASK TREATMENT, EVEN THOUGH IT IS SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it has made my hair so soft and sleek.  Great for stoppping shedding and softer hair(must do a deep condition, leave product in 15 minutes or more! I will purchase this again.  It may be expensive but you are getting what you are paying for!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell absolutely wonderful. The conditioner leaves my hair very soft and manageable. I can&#x27;t detect a garlicky smell, at all. To increase the thickness and grow of my hair, I mix the conditioner with strained onion juice that I make at home. It works really well alone or with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been going to the hair salon and every time I go they are always trying to persuade me into buying products that they sell. I finally came to amazon.com and found a good product that works for my hair. I have very fine thin hair</li>
    <li> Due to hard water my hair was severely tangled, dry, brittle, hard, and badly breaking. It felt equivalent to Brillo, used to scrub cast iron pots, but just after one use of this combo I was set free and the tangles were unlocked easily by hand with minimal breakage. I never knew my hair could be so soft and shiny. Now I want to show off my curls to the world. No more crying :( . Thank you, Lord Jesus for answering my prayer :) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a Helpful Tip: When dealing with hard water use a water filtering shower head and wash hair with a chelating shampoo at least once a month. Alter Ego has excellent products that will assist you in this battle. Blessed Knowledge.</li>
    <li> Black woman hair are very challenging to take care.Find the right product to keep your hair moiturize and healthy is a real piece of work.I thank God that I tried this products and i&#x27;m so gratefull that it really working for me.Every person&#x27;s hair are different but i hope that who ever that try this alter ego shampoo and hot oil treatment have the same result as i do .My hair look so good, feel amazing, stop breaking, and the best of all growth stronger and healthier.Buy it and you we love it too.</li>
    <li> Good product nice product for the hair</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this shampoo . I thought  about returning it back but I kept it  because I was running out of  shampoo. It was all watery.  On the other hand I did like the deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> Thank you amazon !!! I&#x27;m soooooo happy !!! </li>
    <li> I loved this product.  I use only use the conditioner and now I am use the shampoo, it makes a difference on my hair and my daughter hair.</li>
