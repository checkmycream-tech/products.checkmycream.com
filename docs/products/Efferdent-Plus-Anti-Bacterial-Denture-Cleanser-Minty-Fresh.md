    <li> Got this to clean my skinny bottles I use to store tea.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality.</li>
    <li> It sits. It foams in a small, round area, rising to the top. My patient said to crush them up and sprinkle them... Pain in the butt. Don&#x27;t think we will buy these again.</li>
    <li> received this product on time and it works great and also at a great price.</li>

    <li> Works as advertised. No problems. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great item to lift your total over $35 to qualify for free shipping.</li>
    <li> Have used for years. A great product!</li>
    <li> Can get it cheaper at the Dollar Tree, way cheaper.  $1 for 24.  But GREAT product.  Use it to clean WAY more than dentures... night guards, mouth guards for sports and even use in hard to clean water bottles for a proper cleaning!</li>
    <li> It is what it is and Amazon prime makes it better</li>
    <li> use it to clean mouth guards... not sure how it is on dentures...</li>
    <li> good cleaner. person it was for likes it. Arrived promptly. I love that about Amazon</li>
    <li> This does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I use it to keep my mouth guard clean and fresh. And gets rid of nasty bugs that might give it an odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it really is minty fresh before I put it on at night.</li>
    <li> Would like a stronger mint flavor so that I don&#x27;t taste the bridge material all day long.</li>
    <li> Some Efferdent tablets do not fixed when dropped in the water.  Maybe 1.5% of tablets are fizlesly diffractive.  Hey nothing is perfect!</li>
    <li> Love that I can now have this delivered through my Subscribe &amp; Save service. They work great on my retainers and bite guard.</li>
    <li> This stuff does a great job cleaning any stains off of your dentures, including stuck on adhesive that may be left over.

    <li> I used Efferdent 20+ years ago to clean my retainers after having braces. They worked great back then. Now I wear a night guard for teeth grinding. Efferdent is great at keeping the night guard clean.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. I use to clean my retainers and Camelbak reservoir.</li>
    <li> Good value for the product</li>
    <li> I loved this and the arrival of the product was quick :)</li>
    <li> Old packaging and old tablets. They don&#x27;t look like the ones I was buying in the pharmacy/store. Effective but they look like they&#x27;re out of date.</li>
    <li> This ended up being way overpriced.  Go to Walmart.</li>
    <li> Efferdent is my favorite.</li>
    <li> 5 stars all the way ,super fast shiping</li>
    <li> My husband just got his new dentures and is learning to take care of them. This stuff makes it a lot easier. Just take them off and soak them in it every so often and they come out clean and antiseptic.</li>
    <li> great for kids retainer</li>
    <li> Laugh if you will but I didn&#x27;t purchase these for denture cleaning. I use them as an easy alternative to harsh toilet bowl cleaners. Drop in one or two every week or so and the bowl stays fresh. Another method is to put them in the tank itself.</li>
    <li> what can you say about denture cleanser that tv ads don&#x27;t already say. I like the Plus.</li>
    <li> I use these to clean my custom bite guard (I have TMJ) and they work great.</li>
