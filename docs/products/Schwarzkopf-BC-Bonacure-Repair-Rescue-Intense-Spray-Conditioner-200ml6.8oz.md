    <li> BEST BEST BEST hair stuff ever. i use this daily and love it. it smells awful, but works so well i don&#x27;t care</li>
    <li> This product is magic! I applied it right before flat ironing and the result was smooth &amp; silky no dryness or flyaways.</li>
    <li> My hair is damaged from dying it to much and i started using this product, it left my hair soft and shiny. It smells great also</li>
    <li> Being familiar with this German brand I expected it to do more than it actually does. It does not seem to do my hair much good in terms of manageability or shine.</li>
    <li> Love Love this stuff! I used to use the same product in the blue bottle until the company changed the formula and made it smell like perfume. It was aweful. I saw this and decided it was worth a try and I made the right decision. This works great for my thin hair. It moisturizes so you can get a comb through your hair, but does not leave it heavy or oily at all! It smells great and I hope the company does not ruin this one like they did their blue product. I stock up for this reason. It seems that when I fiind something I like, the formula changes or it gets discontinued! Buy it now!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as the blue version.</li>
    <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
    <li> It smells like alcohol and doesn&#x27;t condition. Bad product bit I bet if aI were to purchase it from a salon, it would be a good product. I would like my money back</li>
    <li> Hair dresser recommended and it does help condition my frizz!  It smells great which is a bonus!  I have thick, frizzy hair and live in the humidity of Florida.  So with color in my hair and humidity anything that helps fight the frizz is my friend! I use this product on my wet hair and to just touch up the ends!</li>
    <li> I got mine earlier than expected&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy like other people have mentioned (so far)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the hairspray smell tho&lt;br /&gt;So far so good tho.</li>
