      <li>It liquefied and easily adsorbed into my skin, the warmth was an added plus.  </li>
      <li>Very rich on the skin and great for the growing belly and as a deep hydrating overnight foot and hand treatment.</li>

    <li> AMAZING STUFF !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Used this while I was pregnant and it felt so nice. Helped when my belly itched and preventing stretch marks!:)</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter was an ok moisturizer but not something I&#x27;d purchase again. I&#x27;ve tried using it in different forms: scraped straight out of the jar and then just rubbed on the skin until it&#x27;s soft and absorbed, scooped into a bowl then placed the bowl in warm water to soften it, added a little coconut oil to soften it...this butter just didn&#x27;t seem to sink into my skin well enough or give a long lasting moisturized feeling. NOW&#x27;s shea butter did a much better job for me, but I personally might just need a more intense moisturizer.    On the plus side, this stuff smells great and it helped to soothe my sister&#x27;s bug bites. I&#x27;m sure it can be a sufficient moisturizer, but maybe it&#x27;s only for those who have average skin instead of skin that&#x27;s very dry.</li>
    <li> I just received my cocoa butter..... How ever it was not pure cocoa butter but with jojoba oil as welll. That&#x27;s why it did not get 5 stars but I love it</li>
    <li> Overall its an ok product. Did notice a difference right away on my stretch marks but its time consuming to heat the product everytime. Also its not very absorbing. Stays on the skin. Would recommend using it at night before going to bed.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying pure cocoa butter so I think its a great product, I put it in my homemade lip balm and its very nourishing. My only thing is its very hard until I heat it up and I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s how its supposed to be.</li>
    <li> The title claims that this is the cocoa butter mixed with jojoba.  It&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s 100% cocoa butter with no jojoba oil added.  I can get that elsewhere, for less money.  Please Amazon, get your items straight.</li>
    <li> When i first recieved this jar of cocoa butter it was/is rock hard and dry. For everyone who hasn&#x27;t yet figured out how to use this product, read this review it will save you some time and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;I cut out the amount of cocoa butter needed from this jar, added it to a heat safe container with coconut oil at room tempurature... I put the container in a pan halfway filled with water, don&#x27;t fill 2 much or the water will go into your container. With low heat and a few minutes the cocoa butter melted nicely into the coconut oil, so I removed it from the heat added argan oil, grapeseed oil and mixed. Once it returned to room tempurature the mixture was not dry or hard. It melts easily when I want to use it and my skin has never felt better or more hydrated. This works wonders on winter dry hair as a leave in treatment overnight. I&#x27;ve also used this mixture on my face, under makeup and at night. I&#x27;ve noticed smoother, brighter skin and wouldn&#x27;t trade my oil for any department store product again.&lt;br /&gt;Give this oen a try, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Not exspensive at all. I bought based on other reviews. My main use was for stretch marks and dryness. This stuff worked great.I used everyday at least once. My stretch marks were not really bad but noticable. After a month of use this definately smoothed and lightened then by at least a shade. Also made my skin soft. It does come in solid form. Don&#x27;t make it harder than it is to use. I just put it in the bathroom sink in hot water while I was in shower.It was ready to go when I was done. Alot goes a long way.I am definately buying again.This container would last a month to 2 months depending how much its used a day and size of person.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought the product,YET, but have a lot of experience with using \\&quot;hard\\&quot; cocoa butter.  My first suggestion is melt it (do not boil) then whip it. this will soften it a lot.  My next suggestion is melt it,(again, do not boil), whip it and place into small molds (as the other reviewer mentioned).  Then you can rub molds across your skin and the heat from rubbing and your skin will soften the butter.  Hope this helps</li>
    <li> This product did not come in a black or dark bottle so I was thrown off. I went ahead and read the directions and gave it a shot. After using scissors to scrape the powder out, I rubbed it between my hands for about 5 minutes, then I got too tired and made my husband help me. We recently discovered that you can put some of the powder into a cup and microwave it to make it a liquid that is easy to apply. I hope this helps with pregnancy stretchmarks! It has done the trick so far :)</li>
    <li> I find it interesting that people would buy something without knowing what it is. I read that a lot of people were either confused or frustrated about their cocoa butter being hard. Pure cocoa butter is suppose to be hard, it&#x27;s not like those cocoa butter creams you buy in the store because this is the pure ingredient not mixed with anything else. That being said, I really love this stuff! I found that the fastest and easiet way to get it out of the jar is to simply take either a butter knife or spoon and just sort of chip or scrape some chunks and shavings out a little at a time.     I make my own lotions and bath products, so I&#x27;ll already have the cocoa butter premixed with something else to make it more &#x27;manageable&#x27; as a hand cream before I head out. I take the cocoa butter pieces, add something like shea butter or an oil(coconut, mineral, EV olive, etc.), put them all in a glass and melt the entire mixture in the microwave. I than pour the mixture into a seperate travel size container, let it sit for about 30 minutes and voila! A very yummy smelling and heavenly hand and body cream! I take the leftover &#x27;crumbs&#x27; still stuck to my hands after chipping the stuff out and just rub them in. I would definitely recommend this to anyone I know, just remember that it&#x27;s going to be hard :)</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3PH0LKHXOKPGI]]I&#x27;ve just loaded a video for more clarity. Happy is what I am with this product and I&#x27;ll order it again. Many apologies for the light angle in the video, but it looks like there&#x27;s a hint of a halo. (Smile) I have been good this year.</li>
    <li> Wow...I didn&#x27;t know natural cocoa butter was so solid. No wonder people prefer to buy the synthetic stuff. When I first got it, I would always have to microwave it every morning or dip it in hot water to melt it because it&#x27;s so solid. I always hope it will stay liquid, but it goes back to its solid state by the next day! I got tired of heating it up so I barely use it anymore. Pros: smells excellent - smells kinda like chocolate! real chocolate. Yea...so does anyone know how to keep in in a liquid state?</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying the now brand of cocoa butter, but I love it. I have gotten compliments on how good it smells. I brought it primarily for my daughter and she said, mommy I could eat this\\&quot;!! I love that it has a great smell, all natural, and moisturizers. I only wish it was sold in a bigger ounce.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth purchase of this item. I absolutely love it. The jojoba oil makes the cocoa butter softer and therefore easier to apply. My skin soaks it in, but does not feel greasy. It helps diminish scars as well, at least it does for me. Loves the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> This was not at all what I expected.  It is very hard to soften without liquifying  it.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.  It was so hard and dried up I couldn&#x27;t help but think it was very old.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews I had to say something.  This stuff is great. Yes it&#x27;s hard but just  take a spoon to get the amount youre looking for and rub it in your hands, within seconds you have a smooth consistency. My skin absorbs it well. Not that difficult...really  lol  You don&#x27;t have to microwave it every time you want to use it either. Cocoa butter and Shea Butter in their purest forms are not going to be super soft. Granted Shea usually  is a little  bit softer  out of the two.  I use this every night before bed on my face and body.  Great stuff :)  I applied some 10 minutes ago and it&#x27;s absorbed and I&#x27;m soft. Only negative  is I&#x27;ll probably  dream of chocolate  :p</li>
    <li> I initially bought this because because of a new bruise I&#x27;d gotten on my forehead that turned into nasty scar. I rubbed this cocoa butter generously on the scar twice a day, once in the evening and once in the morning, for five weeks and was quite surprised to see the scar fade without leaving a mark! My only complaint is that in order to get the butter out of the jar, I had to blowdry it to make it soft or scoop it out with a spoon/knife. This is to be expected though since it is cocoa butter in its pure state (i.e. rock solid hard).</li>
    <li> I did not understand the product to be in a solid state requiring heat to soften before applying. I do not use it often as it is time consuming to prepare.</li>
    <li> This stuff came in solid form, but after reading everything I could on cocoa butter I wasn&#x27;t surprised. It smells so good. I love the chocolaty scent, although, I&#x27;m a little worried that I &#x27;ll smell like a chocolate bar with this on my skin. I did try some of it in places and the scent seemed to die down a bit. All in all I&#x27;m pretty satisfied. I will say this, the amount that comes in the bottle is a joke, no fault of the seller though. It&#x27;s not their fault I had no idea how little 7 oz is. My intention was to use it to make a homemade skin moisturizer. I can go through this in less than a week. I have dry skin so I like to apply lotion liberally. At $8 per jar I would probably end up spending $16 a week which is way to much. While I liked dealing with this seller, I will be looking for someplace where I can get more for my money. I already found a place that sells it at $8/lb (16 oz) almost twice as much cocoa for the same price.    How I used it: I pried the cocoa out the can in chunks with a spoon then melted it down over the stove with an improvised double boiler-- simply a strong plastic bowl held over boiling water. I would suggest melting it over very low heat. This stuff melts fast. I made the mistake of putting it over high heat at first and nearly melted it too much. I wouldn&#x27;t worry if you melt it until it looks like a clear, golden oil. Then I mixed in about 1/4 cup of olive oil and stuck it the freezer to solidify . It wasn&#x27;t rock hard, but more like a thick cream. It could stand to take some more olive oil to thin it out a bit more, but I ran out. I put it back in the jar in came in for later use. It&#x27;ll still work for me though. When I take a shower I&#x27;ll place it under the hot water so that by the time I&#x27;m done it&#x27;ll be nice and soft. Suggestion, especially if you&#x27;re using to fade dark marks or stretch marks, exfoliate while you&#x27;re in the shower with a strong loofa. Then pat dry and put on the butter. It&#x27;ll absorb better and work more effectively.    Great product.</li>
    <li> The smell is great. This leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft without feeling or looking overly greasy. great alternative to lotion</li>
    <li> I liked this product...it has a strong scent of Cocoa but not necessarily unpleasant...it has to be popped in the microwave to soften it..but has worked much better than store-bought moisturizers. I use it in combination with Shea butter.</li>
    <li> Pure, natural product.  I use it for skin care.  It is a firmer substance than lanolin and needs to be warmed slightly in your hands before it is smooth enough to apply to your skin.  A nice addition to skin care.</li>
    <li> This is pure Cocoa Butter (as shown on the product label), not with Jojoba. Besides moisturizing, it is very good for cough treatment - put a small amount (it melts instantly) in your cup of hot milk (tea, coffee) 2-3-4xday during 2-3 days and you&#x27;ll see the result :)</li>
    <li> I use this for my shea butter mix for my skin, it glides on soft, and leaves my skin soft and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I am using pure cocoa butter as a remedy against cough.  There is no scientific basis for that but it does help.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get this butter out from the can. You have to scoop it out and then microwave it. Also, it is not easy for skin to absorb, you get that sticky feeling after applying it. It did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand of shea butter as a moisturizer for years. I am a licensed esthetician. It is a semi hard product, but I it grab some from the container with the back of my thumb nail and liquefy it by rubbing between my hands. It&#x27;s great. I buy this for my friends whose kids suffer from eczema, and they have great results. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my own massage oil - the texture even when warmed and mixed with other oils turns out grainy.  Also it does have a very strong chocolate smell.  I&#x27;m sure the product is good; just not for my purposes.</li>
    <li> and that is a great thing! This is my first time trying cocoa butter in a pure form. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since I my only experience with cocoa butter has been Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Lotion, and I am not a fan of that stuff. I opened the container to be met with the most delicious smell! It smells like chocolate and I don&#x27;t mind that at all. I was able to chip of a piece out of the jar and rub it between my fingers and it melted nicely. I rubbed it on my (very dry) cuticles and wow. My hands soaked it right up, and they are still soft (hours after the fact). I am looking forward to using this on my hair as well, but I can safely say that I will be purchasing this again in the very near future.</li>
    <li> A small amount goes a long way. I use this on my face and even on my 4 yr old son, and his scraps and scars heal quickly with no marks behind. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week. I&#x27;m hoping that the cocoa butter will help with some of the hyper pigmentation under my neck. A little goes a long way so I&#x27;ll be using this for a while. The product smells really good. Thumbs up on this product for sure.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why people have such a problem with it, I&#x27;ve had no difficulty removing it. I mean, I guess it depends on how much you need and for what, but I&#x27;ve found it comes out easily with a little plastic spatula meant for like, scooping cream out of jars and stuff. I get some \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; on the end, and once it&#x27;s out, it begins softening, and begins to melt as soon as I touch it. It takes no work at all. And a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Good for stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Ok this product is amazing, I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks but my skin is definitely softer.     PROS:  smells good  easy to heat up  softens skin  dissolves in skin pretty rapidly    CONS:  I wish someone would have mentioned that it&#x27;s best to put this on at night before you go to bed and wear something that u do not mind getting stained because:  Whatever does not melt into the skin attaches to clothing and makes everything look dirty and powdery looking, of course it is temporary with a wash in the washer but I recommend that you do not use this during the day unless you are going to be relaxing in the sun or in a very warm area!!    Overall,  excellent stuff. I will update much later about whether or not it works on stretchmarks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a lip balm I was making that needed both cocoa and Jojoba oil.  I like it as a moisturizer, just out of the shower I warm it in my hands and apply.  Soft scent and feels so good.  I like the brand Now good price and quality.</li>
    <li> Finally something for my horrible blemishes! I had been using the drugstore brand concoctions for my face and was sadly disappointed many times. It never occured to me that the \\&quot;other\\&quot; ingrdients could be to blame. I enjoy the fact that a little goes a long way and my pores are no longer clogged due to buildup. My skin is so soft and radiant.</li>
    <li> Love the combination of the product.  However, I is so difficult to use as it is rock hard; you need a chisel to get it out and once you do it takes forever to warm in your hands and then apply.  So, I decided to place it in the microwave for about 45 seconds.  It liquefied and easily adsorbed into my skin, the warmth was an added plus.  Be careful, don&#x27;t scaled yourself if you get it too hot. I still like the product and will probably buy more.</li>
    <li> First of all it smells AMAZING, but as previously stated when you receive it it&#x27;s as hard a brick but thats no problem for me as I just pop it in the microwave for a few seconds or put it in some boiling water. It leaves your skin feeling great and as I said earlier you smell great. I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I love that it is pure cocoa, absorbs fast, really makes skin smooth and I feel safe knowing there isn&#x27;t any chemicals other lotions contain. Priced well. Packaging was different than shown. It came in hard form but I did not disolve it on stove like other reviewers suggested. I just rub it to my skin or in between my hands and it works out fine. Only negative after fresh shower I smell like hot fudge sundae but it fades away after it is absorbed throughly.I will continue to use this lotion.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. Its better than the lotions sold at Target or Walmart. Smells like chocolate. It is solid in cold temp. but melts as soon as you put it on.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for our 5 year old that has very sensitive skin. We use all natural products for the most part and that is a huge reason we purchased this product. It is 75% Cocoa Butter 25% Jojoba Oil. No fillers and chemicals added. We just started using but it is working great! It is solid so you need to warm between your palms to melt but it makes lotion after shower and bath more exciting for him! He likes melting and squishing it! Thank you NOW for making such a great natural product!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> To be honest I dont know much about cocoa butter, but bought this to put on my pregnant belly.  It did not prevent me from getting stretch marks, but mine are not that bad.  I can&#x27;t tell if it is helping or not because I have no idea how bad they would be if I didn&#x27;t use this and I am probably pretty genetically prone to stretch marks.  However, it does keep my skin feeling soft and moisturized.  The only complaint I have is that it is quite hard and has to be scraped out with a fingernail and softened in my hands before rubbing on my belly.  I think that is the nature of cocao butter, but when I purchased I thought the addition of jojoba oil would mean it was softer.  So if you are looking for something more like a cream... this is not it.  I have gotten used to scraping it out and like using it.</li>
    <li> shipping wasn&#x27;t fast. And it&#x27;s solid -- hard to get it out for use -- I think it&#x27;s just too much to ask for users to need to heat the whole jar for each use.</li>
    <li> Little softer than pure cocoa butter.  Smells like organic chocolate.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this stuff.  It is smelly and does nothing it says it should do to help.  A real joke.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something more natural than the standard Eucerin or Cetaphil to keep my skin moisturized ... partly because I didn&#x27;t want to be absorbing the chemicals and partly because I do dial printing as part of my job and those two lotions would smear the ink if I used them before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews I got this and mixed it with a roughly equal amount of coconut oil. I am hooked! Even if I don&#x27;t use it for a few days my skin still looks and feels so much better, I have less itchiness from the dry skin that comes with eczema, and I even noticed fading in a dark scar on my arm! Also, I can use it before work if I am having particularly dry skin, and it won&#x27;t smear the ink from printing (though it does sometimes leave a slight oily spot depending on how long it has been since I applied it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy I bought this and will do so again when I run out of my current mix!</li>
    <li> I usually buy shea butter for my skin, but I bought the cocoa butter this time, it is harder and smells very strong. it doesn&#x27;t last as long on my skin as shea butter, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.</li>
    <li> Cocoa butter is hard and difficult to apply.  The addition of the Jojoba oil in this product application as well as mixing with other products a breeze.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The jar was small, I only used this once every other night for the last couple weeks after showering and running almost out. I feel like I need a big chunk to apply on my belly, thigh, and buttocks area because after melting in the palm of my hands and applying to the desired area, it absorbs quickly on my skin. It really smells like chocolate and fortunately I like chocolate</li>
    <li> Smells good and will melt as you apply. But I had to keep a spoon with it so I could scrap out shavings and then had to make them melt together in my hand before using or would be a big mess. Being pregnant I was looking for something to put on belly like lotion. It was too difficult to use it all the time so I stopped using it about half way through.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try making some homemade body butter with magnesium oil in it.  (I made the magnesium oil myself with Premium Nigari I found on Amazon, I am trying to get more magnesium into my body, but via trans-dermal methods).  I found the body butter recipe on coconut mama site: http://thecoconutmama.com/magnesium-why-you-need-it-and-5-ways-to-get-more-of-it/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followed the instructions (although I deviated a little by using a microwave to slightly soften the oils, and cut the recipe in half)  and the resulting product is fabulous!  Very smooth and creamy.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to use on one&#x27;s face and body. Smells good and does not leave an oily residue. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It does not last long on your skin. I use it like 4 times a day. I am a stay at home mom. Smell great when you put it on after 20 minutes the smell is gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this moisturizer! It smells and feels so good, it instantly became part of my daily regimen. I swear I ordered it and it was here in like two days and they even put in a energy bar that tasted delicious.  Im seriously wondering if I have a addiction problem! I can&#x27;t put this stuff down!</li>
    <li> This product feels great on my legs after shaving. It is very soothing. I will be buying it again. Love it.</li>
    <li> This feels more moisturizing than plain cocoa butter and feels more compatible with the skin.  It is lightening up some dark spots and I only used it for a couple weeks.  I love it and will continue to use it to see what the benefits are over a longer period of time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural product to use on my combination skin &amp; the salesperson at my local health foods store highly recommended this product because it is \\&quot;good.\\&quot; I hated it to say the least... not as good as I was made to believe.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing just like chocolate. It melts quick in your hands or wherever you rub it in. My face feels so soft when I apply this. I also use shea butter. Both of those products make my skin feel good. I work in a place where my skin gets dried out very fast so to have something that keeps me feeling so wonderful, I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this body butter! smells so good that I have actually tasted it! Very rich on the skin and great for the growing belly and as a deep hydrating overnight foot and hand treatment. And being it&#x27;s all natural I have not one bad thing to say.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I had to about this product! I bought this product mainly for my stretch marks and preventing new ones from popping up. I have spent probably thousands of dollars on different creams and lotions that promise to help soften the look of existing stretch marks, and none of them have worked. So after melting this product, and adding a little bit of vitamin E oil, I applied it on my stretch marks at least once a day (twice if I wasn&#x27;t lazy before bed time). I have been doing this for about a month, and just today I noticed that my stretch marks are almost invisible! This product has made my skin so moisturized and soft that it has really evened out my skin tone. Now dont get me wrong, my stretch marks are still there, but they are barely noticeable now, which has given me such great confidence! You will not be disappointed with this product!</li>
    <li> I do not have this - it was for my Grandson&#x27;s wife and her tummy. She says it&#x27;s fine but she will appreciate it more after the baby is born. Cocoa butter works fine in preventing stretchmarks. If you are willing to put it on your tummy nightly you will not have them! Hershey&#x27;s used to make pure cocoa butter bars that were wrapped just like the candy bars with the slip label over the paper. But they don&#x27;t anymore. THis is easy to use - carve out a pat of this and place it on your tummy skin wit your hand and smooth it around. You will be glad you did. Pure cocoa butter. I know I should remind her again to do that - as she has had this a while. It&#x27;s a must because stretch marks last forever.</li>
    <li> I knew this was pure which was fine, but the only way to really use this product is to melt it.  Rubbing it between your hands melts it, but is still does not go on my skin smoothly.  I have extremely dry skin.  This product was not for me.</li>
    <li> Great product but delivered late.</li>
