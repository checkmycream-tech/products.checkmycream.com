      <li>and it was worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I usually use designer skin luminary or obsidian, but i LOVE this lotion and am so happy to have purchased it.  </li>
      <li>I tan in a super bed and tan 15mins for 4days</li>
      <li>The first thing that attracted me to this lotion was its smooth texture and application.</li>
      <li>It does turn you extremly red, but that fades away into a nice tan.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I think any adult should be aware of being allergic to certain ingredients and buy products based in that knowledge ...</li>
      <li>The tingle was very intense AFTER getting out.  </li>
      <li>Very reasonable price.</li>

      <li>Do not buy if you do not like the hot tingle sensation..</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different lotions from many different brands and roar gets me the darkest .  </li>
      <li>My first time using it</li>

      <li>I advise that you get a sample and test skin first.</li>

      <li>and it does what exactly the title says.</li>
      <li>This is my first tingle lotion and it really made me a shade darker after tanning for 15 mins in a standup high pressure level 4 bed.  </li>
      <li>and it was INTENSE.  </li>
      <li>Will never buy this product again, and normally I am in love with Designer Skin products, this one however is not a real thing.</li>
      <li>If you feel like your not getting any more color with your other lotions i would recommond this.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a good base first.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This stuffs burned way too much, normally I used bombshell, thought I would try this one.</li>
      <li>I was fine with it, but I&#x27;m dark complected.</li>
      <li>It is exactly the same lotion they sell at my tanning salon.</li>
      <li>Roar offers a slight tingle, but may be stronger for those who rarely use tingle lotions (I like tingle).</li>
      <li>I barely fealt a tingle sensation and barely got a tan after being in the sun for 2 hours and using this product.  </li>
      <li>I had to laugh, because I usually smell like a tanning bed after I tan..</li>

<li> I would recommend this product to people with medium to dark skin..</li>
<li> It&#x27;s  my fav and on Amazon it is about half of what I pay at the salon.&lt;br</li>
<li> I get very dark using this lotion.</li>
<li> I have a hard time getting dark but</li>
<li> and I am DARK!!</li>
<li> I was really nervous about using it because of some bad reviews.</li>
<li> am not sure if i will purchase it again.&lt;br</li>
<li> and i use this at least once a week.</li>
<li> So frustrating!</li>
<li> that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad product.</li>
<li> Not a good idea, it hurts so bad i will never use it again, I still have 3/4 of the bottle and will throw it away.</li>
<li> People who are giving this product bad reviews because of skin irritation shouldn&#x27;t be; they either didn&#x27;t have a base tan or were allergic to an ingredient in the lotion ...</li>
<li> I use it every year after i have achieved a base,  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the smell of this heat lotion for tanning bed use. It is creamy and does not make you greasy when you apply it. It&#x27;s  my fav and on Amazon it is about half of what I pay at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived promptly and was well packaged. It was wrapped in cellophane so you can tell its never been opened. It is exactly the same lotion they sell at my tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I get a great tan with this and have been using it for some time now! Amazon has great prices and same product!</li>
    <li> Love this Lotion, I used it the 2nd day I received it and it does what exactly the title says. It tingles to the point where I feel like a thousand needles are poking me. It contiues to tingle until I left the booth and there afterwards. It does turn you extremly red, but that fades away into a nice tan. My first time using it and I already have color. This is a lotion I will continue to buy. Very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bronzers with Tingle before and this is nothing compared to any of them.  I barely fealt a tingle sensation and barely got a tan after being in the sun for 2 hours and using this product.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion I was really nervous about using it because of some bad reviews. I was fine with it, but I&#x27;m dark complected. If you have fair skin or have never used a tingle lotion I wouldn&#x27;t use it. After about 2-3mins in the tanning bed you feel your blood coming to surface. Your skin will continue to be red and tingle until you shower. Just to give you an idea how good it is I tan in a super bed and tan 15mins for 4days and I am DARK!! I love it wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Also it doesn&#x27;t turn your hands orange like the other bronzers out there.</li>
    <li> This is my first tingle lotion and it really made me a shade darker after tanning for 15 mins in a standup high pressure level 4 bed.  The tingle was very intense AFTER getting out.  It gave me a hot, itchy, tingly feeling and it was INTENSE.  I usually use designer skin luminary or obsidian, but i LOVE this lotion and am so happy to have purchased it.  This product is PHENOMENIAL!&lt;br /&gt;RAWWRRR!</li>
    <li> Good product,tho I didn&#x27;t find it to be very strong. But  I&#x27;ve been tanning for some time now so it could be for the average just starting tanner?</li>
    <li> I have used this product before.  If you like tingle, you will love this lotion...Great for the price and results...I would recommend this product to people with medium to dark skin..</li>
    <li> I love tingle and I researched this product and tried it. I love the color and you get results instantly. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the tingle factor in this product fool you! You think you feel the effects of the lotion and then you do not get a tan or anything at all! So frustrating! And the seal on the top burst out. Will never buy this product again, and normally I am in love with Designer Skin products, this one however is not a real thing. It came in a plastic seal that looked like it may have been tampered with. Not at all satisfied. Will NEVER purchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It doubled my darkness per session, and so i actually tanned less! Makes your skin super soft &amp; smell so good! And buying it on amazon saved me over $30!</li>
    <li> This lotion  is one of the best,  I use it every year after i have achieved a base,  It gives a beautiful , rich color.  I have tried so many different lotions from many different brands and roar gets me the darkest .  Its the only lotion i use year after year.  Very strong tingle. Make sure you have a good base first.</li>
    <li> Roar gives me awesome color EVERY time I tan.  People always wonder what product I use.  This is the one!</li>
    <li> It tans well but it dose have a bit of a burn too it</li>
    <li> This lotion does deliver color that does stay longer than the other lotions i had been buying.&lt;br /&gt;I was not aware that it tingled which caused me to panic slightly in the tanning bed,until i realized what was happening .&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if i will purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;It does work.</li>
    <li> This stuffs burned way too much, normally I used bombshell, thought I would try this one. Not a good idea, it hurts so bad i will never use it again, I still have 3/4 of the bottle and will throw it away.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. It is my fav. I get very dark using this lotion. I just got back from Mexico and all my friends noticed I kept getting darker....This lotion is the reason. It contains a TINGLE! I advise that you get a sample and test skin first. People who burn easy I would say do not use! I paid $90+ for this lotion at the salon and it was worth every penny! This is good stuff. If you feel like your not getting any more color with your other lotions i would recommond this. I have added color with using this. I only go to the tanning bed about 2-3 times a week and i use this at least once a week. This is for Women and Men</li>
    <li> I have used this before and it is one at the top of my list. I have recommended it to lots of people, in fact I tell everyone to buy their tanning products on Amazon.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRIZE GREAT SIZE.. Do not buy if you do not like the hot tingle sensation.. I have a hard time getting dark but THIS WORKS GREAT!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Roar lotion after using several samples from my local area tanning salon. The first thing that attracted me to this lotion was its smooth texture and application. I learned that it was a &amp;#34;silicone&amp;#34; type lotion as compared to other regular tanning lotions that felt sticky and smelly on my skin. Roar has a very pleasant scent. It&#x27;s similar to flowers. My children even asked what perfume I was wearing. I had to laugh, because I usually smell like a tanning bed after I tan..for those who tan, you may know what I mean about that particular smell. Roar offers a slight tingle, but may be stronger for those who rarely use tingle lotions (I like tingle). It does not leave my skin blazing red like other tingle lotions, however. It leaves a nice brownish/amber color on my skin. I&#x27;m normally very light and I do burn on the beach, but then tan to a light color. Roar allows me to achieve a darker color, quicker than the beach. I hope my review helps others. Try a sample to see if you like the silicone texture and scent. I am really happy with this product. Also, I recommend buying the product from on-line. Do some cost research. My tanning salon charges triple of what I paid for it on line. Good luck and happy and careful tanning.</li>
    <li> this lotion was reasonably priced it smells great no orange streaks works great even first time using it will give u great tan</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite indoor tanning lotions. The tingle is just what I like, not too little or too much. People who are giving this product bad reviews because of skin irritation shouldn&#x27;t be; they either didn&#x27;t have a base tan or were allergic to an ingredient in the lotion ... that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad product. Honestly, I think any adult should be aware of being allergic to certain ingredients and buy products based in that knowledge ... but that&#x27;s just me ...</li>
    <li> thought it would have more tingle than it does because of the ratings i read.  Still a good lotion however prefer more tingle/heat</li>
