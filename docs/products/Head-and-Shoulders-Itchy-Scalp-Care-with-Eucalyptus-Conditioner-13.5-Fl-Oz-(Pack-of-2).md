### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>perfect for my hair needs</li>
      <li>works great</li>
      <li>Works and smells great</li>
      <li>Also has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I did try some salon-brand scalp soothers, but they weren&#x27;t working and just made my head burn more!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product that really works.</li>
      <li>it has a nice smell, too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also not too thrilled with the smell.</li>
      <li>Have always liked using it when I feel dandruff in the hair.</li>
      <li>I must admit, that was nice during the heat of the summer.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this because it is excellent on dandruff control</li>
      <li>seems to be the most effective way to apply it..</li>
      <li>and so far, has worked marvelously.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, for some bizarre reason, I can&#x27;t find this conditioner in stores anymore!</li>
      <li>I love it -</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love ;Love ;love this product</li>
      <li>Favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner combo...</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>I recommend using it as more of a spot treatment.  </li>
      <li>This winter was esp full of static</li>
      <li>Love how it leaves my scalp feeling fresh...</li>
      <li>This is good and can be used regularly and new smell, the smell feels like it is a good medicine for headaces.</li>
      <li>..does what it advertises to do..not a shampoo but effective against itchy scalp and dandruff when applied directly to the scalp by hand or moist cloth..and then drying hair without rinsing it out</li>
      <li>This shampoo has menthol in it, which is supposed to cool and soothe the scalp.  </li>
      <li>great product to ease itchy scalp, however, the problem I was experiencing was something other than &amp;#34;dry scalp&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>This makes a big difference on my itchy scalp and is my favorite smell of the many offered by H&amp;S.</li>
      <li>The only reason I haven&#x27;t thrown it own yet</li>
      <li>I really like the scent it leaves and while putting it on my scalp, it makes it feel cool and refreshed.</li>
      <li>On top of that, it leaves my hair really thick and gooey, in a gross way, not in a &#x27;great voluminous body&#x27; sort of way.</li>
      <li>This conditioner helps so much!  </li>
      <li>keep the hair and scalp very soft and clean.</li>
      <li>and this is the only product that keeps my scalp calm and itch free.</li>
      <li>It does not itch nearly as much as before.</li>
      <li>As always, a very reliable product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this product.  </li>
      <li>AND it leaves hair soft and smooth because it is not heavy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as simple and true as that.</li>
      <li>so I had high hopes for this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it solves the problem of an itchy scalp, but it does make it feel a little better.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It also leaves my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>I usually use Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo (which I love), but not their conditioner and ordered this accidentally.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t make hair oilier (I have naturally oily</li>
      <li>but my scalp was really itchy for a long time so someone recommended head and shoulders.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an excellent product that really works. I have had stubborn itchy scalp for years. This product has ended that problem. It also leaves my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> This makes a big difference on my itchy scalp and is my favorite smell of the many offered by H&amp;S.</li>
    <li> Since using this conditioner, I have definitely seen an improvement in my scalp. It does not itch nearly as much as before.</li>
    <li> Love how it leaves my scalp feeling fresh...</li>
    <li> works great..does what it advertises to do..not a shampoo but effective against itchy scalp and dandruff when applied directly to the scalp by hand or moist cloth..and then drying hair without rinsing it out seems to be the most effective way to apply it..</li>
    <li> I love it - i no longer have flakes of dandruff all over my back</li>
    <li> Itches go away.  It&#x27;s as simple and true as that. AND it leaves hair soft and smooth because it is not heavy.  Also has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner combo...I have very sensitive skin and this is the only product that keeps my scalp calm and itch free.</li>
    <li> I meant to order the shampoo.  My bad, obviously, but I didn&#x27;t even realize they made a conditioner in this line and other comments were a bit vague so I figured I&#x27;d hopefully help someone else make the same mistake.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t relieve my itchy scalp, so I gave it two stars. I&#x27;m also not too thrilled with the smell. I like the eucalyptus in it as all this shampoo does is open your sinuses. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> this product not found in stores anymore but on line. it has a nice smell, too. helps with those who have itchy scalp as well.</li>
    <li> Love ;Love ;love this product</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it solves the problem of an itchy scalp, but it does make it feel a little better. Unfortunately, you have to wash your hair more often, when you use it. It makes your hair look dirty.</li>
    <li> love it. reduce itchy scalpy and dandriff. i will buy  this again.it does whst it says it will do. perfect for my hair needs</li>
    <li> This product has helped my scalp a lot in terms of reliving irritation and itchiness caused by flakes. I usually use this in conjunction with [[ASIN:B0043OSIVM Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fl Oz (Pack of 2)]] and so far, has worked marvelously. I really like the scent it leaves and while putting it on my scalp, it makes it feel cool and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff but my scalp was really itchy for a long time so someone recommended head and shoulders. I definitely like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Stopped the itching completely within a few uses&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t make hair oilier (I have naturally oily hair)&lt;br /&gt;Faint scent, smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Tingling sensation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pretty heavy in my hair (which is long, straight, and thin) without being oily&lt;br /&gt;I could definitely tell I had used it and tried to use it only on the ends or switch out products every other day&lt;br /&gt;Cap broke off after a few uses&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t detangle that well for long hair unless I use a lot and don&#x27;t rinse thoroughly</li>
    <li> great product to ease itchy scalp, however, the problem I was experiencing was something other than &amp;#34;dry scalp&amp;#34;. No problem though, my grandson uses weekly and raves about it!!</li>
    <li> I used to wake myself up itching my head at night. That&#x27;s how bad it was. No dandruff, just itch (and the scabs that come along with it). I was embarrassed to get my haircut because they&#x27;d always make comments about the sad state of my scalp. I did try some salon-brand scalp soothers, but they weren&#x27;t working and just made my head burn more! I finally carefully inspected the H&amp;S line and tried this. The effect was immediate. I don&#x27;t ever scratch my head anymore. I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, for some bizarre reason, I can&#x27;t find this conditioner in stores anymore! Why would they carry the shampoo and the 2-in-1 without the conditioner? Come on, H&amp;S. To Amazon I go...</li>
    <li> I usually use Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo (which I love), but not their conditioner and ordered this accidentally. It... does not smell like eucalyptus. I&#x27;m not sure when it does smell like- it&#x27;s not pleasant. On top of that, it leaves my hair really thick and gooey, in a gross way, not in a &#x27;great voluminous body&#x27; sort of way. The only reason I haven&#x27;t thrown it own yet is I&#x27;d feel like it&#x27;d be a waste of money, so I&#x27;m just waiting until I&#x27;ve used it all up.</li>
    <li> Have always liked using it when I feel dandruff in the hair. keep the hair and scalp very soft and clean.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has menthol in it, which is supposed to cool and soothe the scalp.  I must admit, that was nice during the heat of the summer.  However, this shampoo did not help with my sore, itchy scalp. If anything it made it worse. May work for some, but not me!</li>
    <li> This is good and can be used regularly and new smell, the smell feels like it is a good medicine for headaces.</li>
    <li> It definitely cooled my scalp during use, and softened my hair, but the anti-itching effects didn&#x27;t last throughout the day. That said, I don&#x27;t think it worsened my scalp, like some other conditioners did.</li>
    <li> As always, a very reliable product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long-time user of the Itchy Scalp Care H&amp;S shampoo by Procter and Gamble so I was very disappointed to find this matching conditioner actually CAUSED my scalp to be itchy! Sad too that I bought a three-pack. This winter was esp full of static so I had high hopes for this conditioner. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> head and shoulders is a name brand that I trust I would highly recommend this because it is excellent on dandruff control</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this product.  I am not sure why it is suddenly difficult to find in stores.  Dandruff isn&#x27;t an issue for me, but I do get itchy scalp.  This conditioner helps so much!  I recommend using it as more of a spot treatment.  Just rub a bit into your scalp and let it soak in while you wash your face or whatever, then rinse. Works wonders!</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your head, neck and ears cold... seriously.... i cant leave it on for very long before im freezing... no i wouldnt buy it again EVER</li>
    <li> All the sudden this conditioner was difficult to find in stores, was grateful I could get on line at automatic shipments. I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and they just don&#x27;t take care of the itch as this one does!</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years now. It does reduce itching.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an itchy scalp for ten years. The local stores only carry one or two kinds of dandruff products, which didn&#x27;t work for me. But Amazon has lots to choose from and now my itch is gone! I use the Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo for dry scalp and the conditioner for itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> dry my hair out badly and made my Skout its more than what it was supposed to. will never buy again</li>
