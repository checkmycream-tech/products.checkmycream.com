      <li>- I am subscribed to auto-ship to stay stocked at all times :)</li>
      <li>I love palmers cocoa butter products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the body lotion for a number of years and just love it.  </li>
      <li>You can read my review on the cleanser to get more of an explanation.</li>
      <li>The appeal to this product is the scent for many people.  </li>
      <li>Really love how lightly moisturizing yet effective this product is.</li>
      <li>, my make up does glide easier when i have this lotion on, and it seems like it gives you more of a glow combined with your makeup.</li>
      <li>This lotion seems to diminish the redness, and make my skin in these areas more of a match to the rest of my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
      <li>Her skin is just lovely</li>
      <li>When it&#x27;s gone, I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more of this.</li>
      <li>do love their hand lotion and have been it exclusively for years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>LOVE ALL PALMER&#x27;S PRODUCT</li>
      <li>Excellent for dry skin and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
      <li>This is great and sensitive on the skin.</li>
      <li>Very light and clean and moisturizes well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use these on other parts of the body, but perhaps &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; is not the best solution for my face.</li>
      <li>Originally found this product in a store clearance sale, and it was much better than others I have used.  </li>
      <li>It is not greasy, and like another review said, my makeup seems to glide on easily over this product.  </li>
      <li>I noticed that immediately after I apply this product to my face after I cleanse it, I experience a STRONG tingling sensation...</li>
      <li>It has a nice subtile scent, it feels great on the skin, and i agree with the other reviews</li>
      <li>Works fine.  </li>
      <li>quite light and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;what caught my eye: spf 15 and peptides and lightweight, which is important because my skin tends to&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
      <li>This product is light and leaves your skin moisturized.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway I keep my porcelain skin so fabulous because I use this lotion.</li>
      <li>Keeps my face smooth.  </li>
      <li>but so far so good grate product for the price</li>
      <li>It is highly moisturizing and nice smelling, absorbs well, and doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feel that a lot of lotions with sunscreen have (I&#x27;m looking at you, Eucerin).</li>
      <li>Well, let me tell you, I&#x27;ve got a drawer full of tinted moisturizers and SPF moisturizers to sink</li>
      <li>I am an american african, this lotion is one of the best i ever seen !</li>
      <li>This might work better on someone with normal skin.  </li>
      <li>but my skin looks great and my black spots vanish....</li>
      <li>Good for dry skin and for skin thinned by medications.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a hand lotion with SPF and found that those are quite rare.</li>
      <li>so I can look fresh</li>
      <li>Not unpleasant, but not my first preference either.  </li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s important to have facial moisterizes that are easy on the skin that don&#x27;t burn when you apply them after some kind of clenser/facial treatment that leave your face red and blotchy, this does&#x27;nt do that.</li>
      <li>and my make-up just glides right on.</li>
      <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s skincare line and face line in general.</li>
      <li>My black spots are almost gone for good.</li>
      <li>I received the item very fast .</li>
      <li>It has left my skin having a nice little warm glow afterwards.  </li>
      <li>so I just call her by her first name.)  </li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daily lotion does work best when used in combination with the daily facial cleanser and night cream.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I started using this daily facial lotion, areas on my face that I had been unable to heal, healed very well.  I am extremely pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I have dry skin so instead of putting lotion on my face, I use this moisturizer.  I doesn&#x27;t clog your skin. Great investment</li>
    <li> As stated in my review about the gentle daily cleanser this product did more harm than good.  The cleanser left my face so dry that I almost had to go to a doctor and the daily facial lotion didn&#x27;t help at all but I felt it contributed some to the problem.  I know that not all products are for all people and this one and the cleanser was not for me!!!!!!! This is why I gave it one star.  You can read my review on the cleanser to get more of an explanation.</li>
    <li> too oily for my skin type</li>
    <li> When I saw Palmers came out with a face lotion and cleaser I immediately grabbed it off the shelf.  I&#x27;ve been using the body lotion for a number of years and just love it.  However the face lotion caused me to break out.  Added the extra star for Palmers brand name.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, it&#x27;s the first time a face lotion has caused me to breakout because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this every day and loves it.  Her skin is just lovely and she&#x27;s 70 years young.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s grandma asked me once why I&#x27;m not more tan.  I was all KINDS of embarrassed, and she was like, &amp;#34;Why don&#x27;t you just lay out in your yard?&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m like, &amp;#34;Because I WORK during the day, JULIE.&amp;#34;  (She&#x27;s not his real grandma so I just call her by her first name.)  But I tried to be polite and I was like, &amp;#34;Surely I&#x27;m not VAMPIRE pale,&amp;#34; and she goes, &amp;#34;Well you kind of are!&amp;#34;  So insulting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I keep my porcelain skin so fabulous because I use this lotion.</li>
    <li> LOVE ALL PALMER&#x27;S PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I cant put alot on my face. I love palmers cocoa butter products. This is great and sensitive on the skin. I can apply this to my face to moisturize it before I put make up on without my skin acting all funny, like it drying up with your make up and coming off in line flakes or something weird like that. Also it&#x27;s important to have facial moisterizes that are easy on the skin that don&#x27;t burn when you apply them after some kind of clenser/facial treatment that leave your face red and blotchy, this does&#x27;nt do that. Very thankful for my soft face.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best facial moisturizers i&#x27;ve tried.  It has a nice subtile scent, it feels great on the skin, and i agree with the other reviews, my make up does glide easier when i have this lotion on, and it seems like it gives you more of a glow combined with your makeup. It has almost 3 and 1/2 oz, which is so much  product! My skin gets a little dry through out the day, but with this product my face feels moisturized and hydrated all day!  Great quality, and great price!!! Would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Though I&#x27;m not thrilled with the ingredients list (I&#x27;d prefer far fewer ingredients), I really like the feel of this lotion.  I need a light daily moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me greasy or cause break outs, and so far this fits the bill.  The scent is very light and fades after applying.  There is no white cast from the SPF (I get that from more natural products, which are also much harder to rub in and which do cause me to break out.)I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with the foaming gentle cleanser, eye cream, and night renewal cream from the same line, and I&#x27;m really liking the results:  soft, soft skin; no breakouts; dry patches are gone.  Hope these results continue!</li>
    <li> Well, let me tell you, I&#x27;ve got a drawer full of tinted moisturizers and SPF moisturizers to sink&lt;br /&gt;a ship. I have one tinted moisturizer that I paid 38. bucks for and it doesn&#x27;t give me any coverage&lt;br /&gt;at all, and it doesn&#x27;t sink in, and I have moisturizers with spf that sit on my face and feel greasy&lt;br /&gt;and I hate to put foundation on top of what feels like dirty skin! Do not let the price of this moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;fool you! I paid more for poorer results. This one sinks into my skin and feels nourishing and here&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;what caught my eye: spf 15 and peptides and lightweight, which is important because my skin tends to&lt;br /&gt;get oily throughout the day! It sinks right in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy; as a matter of fact, it feels&lt;br /&gt;refreshing and my make-up just glides right on. I cleanse my face meticulously so I can look fresh&lt;br /&gt;throughout the day and this before the foundation is just the ticket. Since I&#x27;m fair, I need an spf&lt;br /&gt;to protect my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I had been so pleased with other Palmer&#x27;s products.  This one did not disappoint!  I use it on my face, neck and chest.  Since entering my \\&quot;pre-menopausal\\&quot; years, my neck and chest have developed a redness that doesn&#x27;t go away.  This lotion seems to diminish the redness, and make my skin in these areas more of a match to the rest of my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Like the other Palmer&#x27;s products, it does not have a heavy, perfumey scent.  It is not greasy, and like another review said, my makeup seems to glide on easily over this product.  I have been using it for about 2-3 months and plan to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this as my winter face lotion.  The consistency is thick, not runny at all, so I find it too heavy for use in the summer, but in the winter, it helps seal moisture in my skin so well that even a cold wind doesn&#x27;t bother my skin!</li>
    <li> I am an american african, this lotion is one of the best i ever seen ! It makes my skin so soft not oily and makes my skin perfect with no acne. My black spots are almost gone for good. I had a lot of wrinkles it reduces my wrinkles little bit and i hope with times it will reduces a lot! I&#x27;m proud of my skin when a look in the mirror.</li>
    <li> Cant go wrong with CoCoa butter just make sure it is pure. I like how it feels it feels so good make sure you check it out see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hand lotion with SPF and found that those are quite rare. So, I looked into inexpensive facial moisturizers with SPF--the richer, the better. This was perfect for my purposes. It is highly moisturizing and nice smelling, absorbs well, and doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feel that a lot of lotions with sunscreen have (I&#x27;m looking at you, Eucerin). Makes my hands look younger. Normally I carry this around in my backpack. When traveling, I use it as an all-purpose moisturizer for face, body, hands. (It did make it through airport security once, though it&#x27;s technically over 3 ounces.) Since my face skin is combo/oily, this is too heavy for me to use all the time on my face, but if I had dry skin I would. Great price. I&#x27;ve actually never seen this in a store, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> I received the item very fast . When I received it, I thought I would be disappointed again, because I have been searching for a good moisturizer for a long time. I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and have very dry skin , but this lotion lived up to my expectations. It&#x27;s wonderful....</li>
    <li> I really want to like this product because I like Palmer&#x27;s products and I like the way it feels on my skin. I just can&#x27;t figure out why it burns my eyes when I put it on my face. I&#x27;m not talking about applying it near the eyes, either -- I stay clear of the eye area during application. I&#x27;ve never had a moisturizer that caused this problem. And if you rub your face and then accidentally rub your eye, it gets even worse. When it&#x27;s gone, I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more of this.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying lotions online. Have yet to try it on my face, as I have sensitive facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;I tried on my arms n legs and so far no reaction or itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;Its quite light and non-greasy. Cant wait to start using it.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily on the T-Zone and normal on the rest of it and this moisturizer does the work to balance it. i really like it, it is lightweight, not greasy but I&#x27;m still not sure if it works under makeup though. overall, like it! Also, great for the mornings because of the sun proof formula.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face smooth.  Wash face with face cloth, hot ,then cold water, dry with towel, then use Palmer&#x27;s.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I had hoped this would be as moisturizing as the rich body cream, however it leaves my face feeling dry, so I have to apply a second application it, disappointing because now it won&#x27;t last as long!</li>
    <li> My face broke out with every other product, but this one is very light and not oily. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the full compliment of Palmer&#x27;s facial and body lotions and started using them.  They are all a bit greasy, and make me smell like a gigantic chocolate bar.  Not unpleasant, but not my first preference either.  Aftr about three days my face started breaking out so I&#x27;ve discontinued use of the Daily Facial and Night Renewal Creams.  Too bad.  I had high hopes for this lotion.  I&#x27;ll continue to use these on other parts of the body, but perhaps &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; is not the best solution for my face.</li>
    <li> Best face cream ever! I am highly allergic to may products and since I have lupus my skin sometimes reacts badly to lotions, but I use this every night (I know it has SPF in it) and my skin stays soft and moisturizer the whole night and next day. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Prefer  the Night creme</li>
    <li> I have used name brand moisturizers all my life, and this one would be at the top of the list for me. I hope they never stop making this. A little bit goes a long way and keeps my face moist and soft all day long. All that, plus you can&#x27;t beat the price! It&#x27;s just about perfect in my book. And did I mention that it has a nice soft fragrance that doesn&#x27;t fight with any other fragrance you might be wearing. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dabbled with more expensive moisturizers like Kiehl&#x27;s, but the Palmer&#x27;s just gets the job done without having a heavy scent and ~$25 cheaper.</li>
    <li> This lotion is really nice. I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful with any face creams. This one is a winner for sure. Plus the first tube was damaged during shipment; the seller sent me a brand new one the next business day!!! Awesome cats!</li>
    <li> So I bought this because it was on sale and now I see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dried out my skin so terribly! Complete opposite of what I was going for.  Stay away!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream and do not understand why Harmon no longer carries it!</li>
    <li> still using this item, do you have something for age spots at all?</li>
    <li> I received an expired bottle.</li>
    <li> Works alright, not a strong cocoa butter smell. A little greasy in my opinion. I shave my head and use it because of the SPF but it&#x27;s a tad oily/greasy directly after application.</li>
    <li> as i say Really Good UVA/UVB Excellent - you cant really go wring with palmers - wish the made a tanning lotion SPF 2 or 4 - who knows maybe they do and i just cant find it but so far so good grate product for the price</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin moisturized and less wrinkled</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Perfect for sensitive skin, smells great and works fantastically.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> contains some abrasive particles</li>
    <li> Have tried many moisturized ar varying prices.  I have totally switched to Palmer&#x27;s daily Facial Lotion.  My face is not dry, no blemishes and skin is soft.  Do hope Palmer&#x27;s continues this product.  I had to order it from Amazon as Walmart, Target, CVS and Walgrenes did not have it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Very light and clean and moisturizes well.  Keeping age away as long as possible, it&#x27;s helping - I am subscribed to auto-ship to stay stocked at all times :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different moisturizers over a broad price range, and while this isn&#x27;t perfect, it has proved to be the best for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it a year or so ago, I found the feel kind of odd--velvetly but less &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than I was used to. I put it aside while I used up a bottle of pricier stuff. I decided to try it again a few months ago and started to like it more with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the SPF is only 15, I mix it with a higher SPF sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough on its own (Kiss My Face or Ocean Potion). While this may sound like more trouble than it&#x27;s work, my skin looks much better than it has with other moisturizers. I just but a little glob of each in my palm every morning to mix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daily lotion does work best when used in combination with the daily facial cleanser and night cream.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this really badly because I love cocoa butter products.  Unfortunately I think that it is causing breakouts.  I&#x27;m 38 with combination skin which tends to dry in the winter.</li>
    <li> At first I was sceptical about buying this product beecause of my very  sensitive skin. After using if for about a week, I notice very little breakout but with continued use it went away. After about a month , my skin has transformed beautifully. I got a compliment  on how  nice my skin looked from my husband today :). I will definately be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Originally found this product in a store clearance sale, and it was much better than others I have used.  It is thick enough that it is more like a cream than a lotion, and has the sunscreen too.  Great for dry skin especially.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice light moisturizer,it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy,and it soaks in well. I was disappointed in the fragrance however,I was expecting it to smell like cocoa butter but it  doesn&#x27;t. It does also burn if you happen to get it in or around your eyes.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin, and this is the only moisturizer that works. All Palmer&#x27;s products are great. I use almost the whole line for face and body.  My family has used Palmer&#x27;s products them through two generations.  I am 64 years old, and the products really give me a glow.</li>
    <li> This product is light and leaves your skin moisturized.  It has left my skin having a nice little warm glow afterwards.  The best part is that it has SPF in it.  This works wonders!</li>
    <li> Dried my face some but other then that it was okay. Really smooth on the face and gives a nice glow.</li>
    <li> The smelll is a little stange,which is very different from other products of palmers.Not a cocoa smell at all.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist said these items are not good to use for acne, or to improve skin, I purchased a bunch of items that I threw out.</li>
    <li> This was ok.  I only used the one tube and went back to my usual, neutrogena aha spf 15 daily moisturizer.  This was a little too thick for use in the summer, for me, not enough in the winter and too much when used in combination with their rosehip oil.  This might work better on someone with normal skin.  It did absorb quickly, but has a strong scent that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all-time favorite facial lotions.  Only downside is that it&#x27;s difficult to find in any stores by me so I always have to wait until my Amazon cart is big enough to include it as an add-on item.  I know some people have found Cocoa Butter products oily, but I do not and I have combination skin.</li>
    <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s skincare line and face line in general. I think it is extremely moisturizing and keeps my skin extremely hydrated!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it reacts to others, but it stings my skin when I use it. I&#x27;m Peruvian and have yellow boned skin color.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I love it, is light, has sun protection, is not animal tested, and I use it everyday, this bottle last me like 6 months or even more. Use this since over a year ago, and wouldn&#x27;t change it.</li>
    <li> very good, the whole line of Palmer&#x27;s products is very good. The service was good also, everything came on or before the date stated.</li>
    <li> I like this.  It is not so thick as regular cocoa butter and not so sticky as vitamin E, but incorporates both.  Good for dry skin and for skin thinned by medications.</li>
    <li> This is really good.  Very light and smells wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Works fine.  The appeal to this product is the scent for many people.  Plus, it&#x27;s not as expensive as some similar products.</li>
    <li> Love Palmer&#x27;s products and this one is great.  Consistency is perfect. Had a dry patch on my face and after 3 weeks it was gone. I like the fact that it does not make your face feel oily or look shiny. Would recommend to anyone with normal or normal/oily skin.</li>
    <li> I really love Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa products. I&#x27;ve used them for years. This product is nice and creamy smooth but unfortunately because of the &amp;#34;Fresh Lily&amp;#34; scent it has I found if I got it too close to my eyes it burned and my eyes watered for hours. Sometimes I even had to wash the lotion off my face.&lt;br /&gt;I really wish this product, and quite a few other Palmer&#x27;s products, didn&#x27;t smell like fresh while lily. I much prefer the natural cocoa scent Palmer&#x27;s usually has. Even their unscented products are less irritating then the &amp;#34;Fresh Lily&amp;#34; scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like flowery or perfumed scents around your face. I&#x27;d avoid this product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer leaves my skin completely hydrated, soft, &amp; vibrant. I use it morning &amp; night &amp; I never have to reapply it during my long days. The moisturizer lasts all day long...that is just how amazing it is. My only problem with this moisturizer is that they should include a warning label after the directions. I noticed that immediately after I apply this product to my face after I cleanse it, I experience a STRONG tingling sensation...To avoid this feeling if you have sensitive skin, DO NOT apply IMMEDIATELY after you cleanse your skin. Wait at least 10 minutes, &amp; then apply the moisturizer. This is what I have done &amp; thankfully, I no longer feel the tingling sensation...&amp; as a result, I am hooked to this product for life &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Cocoa butter products work best for my skin since I&#x27;m sensitive to lanolin and ingredients many soaps and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Plus: Product does make my skin very soft, moisturizes well, and is non irritating to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Negative: This daily facial lotion is too thick/heavy for daily use for me. It couldn&#x27;t find any information that says it is noncomedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores.) My pores seem to have enlarged since starting use of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love their hand lotion and have been it exclusively for years.&lt;br /&gt;I bought facial cleanser at same time and like it&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Product made my face oily and made me sweat a lot!!! Love the other products though</li>
    <li> She loves this product and uses it with the Palmer&#x27;s cleanser. Excellent for dry skin and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
    <li> Really love how lightly moisturizing yet effective this product is.</li>
    <li> Only lotion that helps with my dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face flakey, but also doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy like some others I have tried.</li>
    <li> i started using it as soon as i got it, i use it in the night mostly than in the day cause i sweat a lot but my skin looks great and my black spots vanish.... i love it</li>
    <li> Keep my face soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Trust Palmer&#x27;s to protect my face all day. Great product!</li>
