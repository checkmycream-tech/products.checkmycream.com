      <li>i would recommend it to a friend:-)</li>
      <li>I actually purchased the cream because they had run out of the liquid, and that was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.</li>
      <li>After a week, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was seeing any progress.</li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied and the product does work the way it says it does.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for skin rashes, and razor bumps,also can prevent pimples from becoming infected and making them disappear much sooner</li>

      <li>The progress becomes more and more evident by the week.</li>
      <li>Cool sensation with a good finish, highly recommended for all men.</li>
      <li>Can anyone shed some light on this?</li>
      <li>product has kept my skin relatively smooth, for someone who uses his clippers every 3 or 4 days, and helps to minimize or get rid of razor bumps.</li>
      <li>so it feels like smooth when you put it on.</li>
      <li>and it works pretty quickly! :)</li>
      <li>When this came in the mail, I was beyond excited.</li>
      <li>so overall it works really good at preventing ingrowns.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t had a lot of success with this product</li>
      <li>One thing I noticed was that this product works fastest after a fresh shave and/or exfoliation.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t often use a razor, only on special occasions, and rely on my hair clippers most of the time.</li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast so thank you to that</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>I went out on a limb and purchased this not knowing exactly what I was getting into.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>this really works!</li>
      <li>Its more of a \\&quot;good\\&quot; burn, where you know it is actually doing something.</li>
      <li>I can only imagine how many bumps I would have had, had I not been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been through a few ingrown hair treatment products over the years and so far, this has provided the best result in this short of time.</li>
      <li>Any African American out there who is looking for products to fight razor bumps and ingrown hair, now you can be relieved because R&amp;C has done the necessary research and developed the best product.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product out of pure desperation.</li>
      <li>Amazing, I have been using it for a little over two months &amp; it does wonders.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to others!</li>
      <li>however, it softens the skin and hairs making them much easier to extract.</li>
      <li>The real deal breaker</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>and then I will get bumps, but the cream is very helpful in getting rid of or minimizing them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to take care of the bumps in the bikini area as much as I thought from reading reviews.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>This stuff really work.</li>
      <li>After days of struggling with razor bumps,at one point I even had chemical burn as a result of trying  some product I found at some beauty store, now I have a sigh of relief, Thanks to R &amp; C.</li>
      <li>and it really works.</li>
      <li>wish I could find a more natural product for a similar price.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I use a razor, lightly, after the clippers in order to clean up some spots, but I don&#x27;t shave my entire face or head with a razor on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>but definitely not as bad as it used to be especially after waxing.</li>
      <li>I like this better that the Skin Tight Razor Bump Ointment since it does not sting much after waxing.  </li>
      <li>Most of us are just not lucky enough to be able to use a razor regularly without consequences, so to say that this product doesn&#x27;t work is inaccurate.</li>
      <li>No results on my razer bumps or breakouts and the smell is intense, but it did make my skin soft.</li>
      <li>product stings a tiny bit but nothing significant, and definitely nothing that would deter me from using this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the exact same BRAND that I have purchased before</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells odd - perhaps like camphor - but goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>I guess next time, I will make sure to go through the previous seller.</li>
      <li>It was so bad that going swimming or wearing a belly shirt became more and more something</li>
      <li>Hope that helps clear up some confusion.</li>
      <li>Hope that helps clear up some confusion.would have had, had I not been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of my ingrown hairs</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if was old</li>
      <li>Product has worked very well for me for the last year I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
      <li>then he has been since my early teens.</li>
      <li>Strong smell but did get rid of bumps but not the small skin tags...</li>
      <li>Every product has limitations and only something very expensive would be able to deal with the plight that most people of color experience while shaving.&lt;br</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t see any real results and the texture and smell was unpleasant..went back to very expensive tendskin with really good results</li>
      <li>and I ain&#x27;t goin back to the old ways</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually helps me. It&#x27;s my saving grace, one of those few products I can set upon my beauty shelf of champions for a permanent position. Bliss Ingrown Hair Eliminating Pads did nothing for me. TEND did nothing but burn. And this, the cheapest of those three listed, is a little beauty. The pot is about the size of an Olay eye cream pot, but a little goes a long way. I use this nightly before bed. What used to look like a nightmare of bumps on my bikini has been soothed, and really it only takes two days to see results. This is different in that it is hydrating, a lotion rather than a drying alcohol, and I think that makes all the difference. Or at least it did for this thick, curly-haired girl.</li>
    <li> Product has worked very well for me for the last year I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is just me but I tried this stuff three times and it was like torture. I felt like my skin was on fire. It went into the trash.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time. I actually purchased the cream because they had run out of the liquid, and that was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The cream is so much more effective. I even purchased it for a friend and they said that it cleared up many of their in-grown hairs. I used to use the liquid, which came in a 4 oz. bottle, but so much of it was wasted on the cotton balls. One bottle would only last me about two months. The liquid contained a lot of alcohol, which was used as a delivery system, and it did dry out my skin. The cream does not dry out your skin, and if anything, it slightly moisturizes it. I always apply the cream after I have shaved and washed the area, and it has worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t often use a razor, only on special occasions, and rely on my hair clippers most of the time. Sometimes I use a razor, lightly, after the clippers in order to clean up some spots, but I don&#x27;t shave my entire face or head with a razor on a regular basis. For that matter, there are very few people who can use a razor regularly, without consequential razor bumps, no matter what product they use afterwards. Most of us are just not lucky enough to be able to use a razor regularly without consequences, so to say that this product doesn&#x27;t work is inaccurate. Every product has limitations and only something very expensive would be able to deal with the plight that most people of color experience while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has kept my skin relatively smooth, for someone who uses his clippers every 3 or 4 days, and helps to minimize or get rid of razor bumps. Every now and then I will get bumps, but the cream is very helpful in getting rid of or minimizing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product stings a tiny bit but nothing significant, and definitely nothing that would deter me from using this product. Its more of a \\&quot;good\\&quot; burn, where you know it is actually doing something. I can only imagine how many bumps I would have had, had I not been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are curious, here is a list of the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Distilled water&lt;br /&gt;Propylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil&lt;br /&gt;Acetylsalicylic acid&lt;br /&gt;Glyceryl stearate&lt;br /&gt;PEG 100 stearate&lt;br /&gt;Sorbitan stearate&lt;br /&gt;Emulsifying wax NF&lt;br /&gt;Cetereth 20&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum&lt;br /&gt;Myristyl myristate&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin A&lt;br /&gt;DL panthenol&lt;br /&gt;Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Dioazolidinyl urea&lt;br /&gt;Propylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxyethyl cellulose&lt;br /&gt;Allantoin&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only alcohol here is DL Panthenol which is actually used as a moisturizer and treating sunburn or tattoos. So whoever wrote the review about alcohol in the cream drying out their skin was obviously mistaken or had the wrong product. I will never use the liquid again but I LOVE the cream. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE USED BY ANYONE WHO HAS AN ASPIRIN ALLERGY (acetylsalicylic acid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for writing this review is that I was about to reorder and saw some of the erroneous reviews written by other users. BTW, this jar has lasted me over a year. I don&#x27;t think that you can actually get the extra strength cream on here, but the regular strength cream is doing the job. Just stay away from the liquid. Hope that helps clear up some confusion.would have had, had I not been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are curious, here is a list of the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Distilled water&lt;br /&gt;Propylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil&lt;br /&gt;Acetylsalicylic acid&lt;br /&gt;Glyceryl stearate&lt;br /&gt;PEG 100 stearate&lt;br /&gt;Sorbitan stearate&lt;br /&gt;Emulsifying wax NF&lt;br /&gt;Cetereth 20&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum&lt;br /&gt;Myristyl myristate&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin A&lt;br /&gt;DL panthenol&lt;br /&gt;Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Dioazolidinyl urea&lt;br /&gt;Propylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxyethyl cellulose&lt;br /&gt;Allantoin&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only alcohol here is DL Panthenol which is actually used as a moisturizer and treating sunburn or tattoos.

    <li> Does exactly what it says it does. It also works well as a moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of my ingrown hairs but I feel like it helps.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if was old but this put boils on my face</li>
    <li> The smell of this stuff is disgusting to me. It&#x27;s a mix of tea tree and some other strange mix of fragrance. It&#x27;s verging on unbearable and you&#x27;re supposed to apply this stuff twice a day for it to work. It also stings a bit (probably the tea tree oil) when you put it on. I feel a bit like I wasted some money, but I will keep using it and see if it makes a difference after a few days. I just can&#x27;t get over the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could find a more natural product for a similar price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a black male and I have to shave my face to stay within military regulations. That being said my hairs are always ingrown  but this stuff is amazing! My suggestion would be to apply after you shave and the day after that</li>
    <li> This is a great product for skin rashes, and razor bumps,also can prevent pimples from becoming infected and making them disappear much sooner</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say but I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. It&#x27;s the exact same BRAND that I have purchased before but it was not the same product. The shipping was very fast so thank you to that BUT the product itself was B-A-D. It was melted and liquid. It was supposed to be a cream. I figured that it was because of the heat, so i let it set out for 4 days to solidify but it never completely did. About 30% of it did solidify but never turned into a cream and I even tried to shake it to make it mix with the oil but it has yet to happen. I&#x27;m having to make due with it because I paid for it. I guess next time, I will make sure to go through the previous seller.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me, if you have problems with ingrown hairs you should give it try. It&#x27;s the only product that i&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
    <li> Coming from a person that has to shave almost every part of her body and I do get razor bumps this product is amazing I hope they do not discontinue it and I love it..</li>
    <li> Amazing, I have been using it for a little over two months &amp; it does wonders. Im prone to getting razor bumps &amp; tiny littlw ingrown hairs on my legs &amp; it works wonders. Although it has an odd smell to it.</li>
    <li> No results on my razer bumps or breakouts and the smell is intense, but it did make my skin soft. I busses im going have to get something eles</li>
    <li> I went out on a limb and purchased this not knowing exactly what I was getting into.  Honestly my skin has never felt or looked better!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this cream for 3 weeks and it works great and my skin is very smooth i would recommend it to a friend:-)</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a Magazine and decided to try it. I am completely satisfied and the product does work the way it says it does.</li>
    <li> I like this better that the Skin Tight Razor Bump Ointment since it does not sting much after waxing.  And it is cream so it feels like smooth when you put it on.</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps with razor bumps and in grown hairs. Smells bad, but does the job!!!</li>
    <li> The cream is just as good as the liquid. It tingles, no burning. Prevent ingrown hairs. Worth the price. Better than bump free.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any real results and the texture and smell was unpleasant..went back to very expensive tendskin with really good results</li>
    <li> Preliminary only (as of 5.10.2015).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells odd - perhaps like camphor - but goes on smooth. My chin is in terrible shape from years of digging out ingrown hairs, and I haven&#x27;t evaluated it yet in terms of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I wanted to mention (as others have) that the bottle says it contains a California Prop. 65 chemical (birth defects or reproductive harm). However, I just searched through the entire Prop. 65 chemical list, on the CAS numbers corresponding to the ingredients listed on the bottle. I didn&#x27;t find any of the ingredients on the state list (as of March 2015). I left a message for the company but did not hear back. Can anyone shed some light on this? Thanks.</li>
    <li> it works well, smells a little at application. i wear it in the winter time. i use the B &amp; C Skin tight liquid in the warmer months. The creme is too oily for the summer months and the liquid is too dry during the winter months. you will need both</li>
    <li> I used to get some very bad and painful razor bumps from shaving, but this product after just 2-3 days worked to diminish the pain and irritation of the bumps and within a week or so, the bumps were gone, G-O-N-E!  I also enjoy the way it leaves my skin feeling and looking smooth and healthy.  Great price and great product.  I&#x27;ll keep this one on the rotation and ordered to have it stockpiled, because it WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I do believe that it can work, however the smell is awful, and not very pleasing, and for me, that gives a hard time to use this daily, and often, so I refrain from using it due to the strong smell.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend. After days of struggling with razor bumps,at one point I even had chemical burn as a result of trying  some product I found at some beauty store, now I have a sigh of relief, Thanks to R &amp; C. This creme works perfect  and I would recommend it to the other customers who are fighting razor bumps. Any African American out there who is looking for products to fight razor bumps and ingrown hair, now you can be relieved because R&amp;C has done the necessary research and developed the best product. The product works instantly and results can be seen in as short as a day. I have never reviewed on a product like this, but I think its worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and an even better price! I purchased the same product years ago and it has worked wonders for my face and in grown hairs. Highly recommend to others!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that truly keeps me from having razor bumps.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR BLACK MEN and other folks with coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Gave this product 4 stars because it Does reduce and eliminate hair bumps; lost a star (almost 2) because you will have to use this product EVERYDAY, Twice a Day! And it also seems to speed up hair growth... however, it softens the skin and hairs making them much easier to extract. Product has it&#x27;s pros and cons but is overall an excellent product for the cost.</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t work to me! On my husband it dont work for his bumps so we gone try something else sorry!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a lot of success with this product</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to take care of the bumps in the bikini area as much as I thought from reading reviews.  Rather disappointing.</li>
    <li> should have ordered the extra strength version.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have ever found after 41 years of life that keeps the razor bumps off after I shave.  Finally found it and I ain&#x27;t goin back to the old ways</li>
    <li> this really works! great product</li>
    <li> its perfect for my bikini lines! (smell - not the best) i was and use this and it works pretty quickly! :)</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all.the bumps continued showing up every time I shaved was a waste of money.I really was disappointed with it.it may work for others but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff and says it works great.  His face is bump free and cute as a button.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference!</li>
    <li> not sure if this was tampered with but it came with no safety seal and smelled of kerosine when i applied it it burned and left pustules all over the area it was applied. DO NOT BUY THIS BAD BAD BAD</li>
    <li> Changing my review after reading warning label and threw in the trash. Contains a harmful chemical that can cause birth defects AND reproductive harm.</li>
    <li> Received today but returned immediately once I saw the warning label that said this product contains chemicals know to cause birth defects and reproductive harm.  No thanks</li>
    <li> Strong smell but did get rid of bumps but not the small skin tags... Yet. Been using for a couple weeks now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about a month and I have notice a great deal of change on my neck im so gald I choice to use this product it as helped me a lot now when I do cut my neck hair the bumps dont get big and spread all over my neck I hated the look of my neck before now after using this stuff im loving the new look of my neck thank you for making this for people like us...........</li>
    <li> Ok so this was barely filled to the top. it only was enough product to last two weeks,and it didnt even work on the bikini bumps or ingrown.waste of money</li>
    <li> The real deal breaker</li>
    <li> Good product that is helping clean my face and head. Cool sensation with a good finish, highly recommended for all men.</li>
    <li> works well, a little oily compared to the liquid form that you use a cotton pad to apply. I would recommend as a travel option. The liquid form has a tendency to leak out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This stuff really work. I have had bad razor bumps on my face since I have been old enough to shave. I am now in the middle age phase of my life. I have tried numerous product and none of them worked. I decided to try Skin Tight and it really works. My face is clearer then he has been since my early teens. I highly recommend it! Try it, it works!!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been through a few ingrown hair treatment products over the years and so far, this has provided the best result in this short of time. time will only tell if the results hold up but so far, i&#x27;m happy and would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ingrown prone so overall it works really good at preventing ingrowns. I do get one here n there but definitely not as bad as it used to be especially after waxing.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this product. It has made an incredible difference for the very sensitive skin of my bikini line :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this product out of pure desperation. I had never before tried an ingrown hair product before, and I was experiencing what I thought was the worst case of ingrown hairs ever. It was so bad that going swimming or wearing a belly shirt became more and more something I was not comfortable doing because of ingrowns and scarring from them. When this came in the mail, I was beyond excited. I smeared it all in the places I needed it. After a week, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was seeing any progress. Now, about three weeks later, I am definitely seeing progress. Any ingrowns I had went away, and any bumps have drastically minimized. The progress becomes more and more evident by the week. I am very satisfied. I am now feeling as though I can look forward to summer, which is something I never could do. One thing I noticed was that this product works fastest after a fresh shave and/or exfoliation. At this point, I wish I had taken photographic evidence to show my progress!</li>
