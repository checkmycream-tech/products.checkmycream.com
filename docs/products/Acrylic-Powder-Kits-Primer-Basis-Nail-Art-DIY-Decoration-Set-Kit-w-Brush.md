      <li>/&gt;Product works great!</li>
      <li>i wasnt happy</li>
      <li>would be a great gift too</li>
      <li>but  so far it seems like a great product at a great price and great speedy service.</li>
      <li>it hardens so quickly, and sometimes doesn&#x27;t set up good</li>
      <li>I was super happy and excited.</li>
      <li>and I love that you can use the handle part of the brush as a cap, so</li>
      <li>the plastic dampen dish is ok...</li>
      <li>I am always doing my nails myself and love that I can buy when I need to.</li>
      <li>i suppose it you were getting this for a beginner it might be ok...</li>
      <li>it was great and it works very well</li>
      <li>Love love love this, for the price</li>
      <li>the powders are ok but for the price of the kit i wanted to be able to use EVERYTHING...</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the pricing as well.</li>
      <li>I do a lot of nail sculpting and 3d nail art, so Im hoping its easy to work with.</li>
      <li>it stains easily though if you put colored acrylic powder in it.  </li>
      <li>It was sealed so just know its strong.</li>
      <li>so I will be fine.</li>
      <li>WORKS BUT CHEAP PRODUCT</li>
      <li>The brush is cool</li>
      <li>The information about the product does not represent the true product you are selling.</li>
      <li>have a steady hand and proper drill and works out great</li>
      <li>very helpful, gets the job done, not the loudest odor ever, and very useful.</li>
      <li>I also loved the pink acrylic!</li>
      <li>Prive isnt right for this one.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re small size bottles but great product for the price you can&#x27;t complain...</li>
      <li>Better off going to cosmoprof or salon centric</li>
      <li>Cannot believe how fast I got it!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s some other kind of liquid</li>
      <li>I understand the dimensions of the brush but exactly how am I supposed to do a complete full set with that brush.</li>
      <li>All canisters where filled to the top and the brush is a little small but very cute</li>
      <li>I thought the product was open because I could smell it easily through the packaging.</li>
      <li>I am very unsatisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>but i don&#x27;t really know...</li>
      <li>The acrylic settles way too fast.</li>
      <li>it wasnt the nail liquid when i was getting ready to do a clients nails the powder</li>
      <li>They packed it securely, The powder comes with an extra seal plus packed in a zip lock bag .</li>
      <li>Also it is not the normal purple liquid that drys fast</li>
      <li>The brush is super tiny.</li>
      <li>Plus the price is quite high for the product you sold me.</li>
      <li>So that was highly dissapointing..</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll have to buy a new one</li>
      <li>i just wasn&#x27;t as satisfied as i thought i would be very messy too.</li>
      <li>Sets up super fast so not a good product for first timers...</li>
      <li>bought to do my own nails, got tired of paying $ 30</li>
      <li>Everything is super small, and the brush you get isn&#x27;t even the one they show it&#x27;s super tiny and makes doing the acyrlics so much harder and take so</li>
      <li>its cool powders are really small and powder was every where</li>
      <li>i love this kit but the powders are very small!</li>
      <li>The pink powder is a little sketchy, but the others are just fine.</li>
      <li>the brush is super small</li>

<li> The pink powder is a little sketchy, but the others are just fine.</li>
<li> the brush is super small</li>
<li> the brush was to small to even apply the acrylic correctly &amp; fumed my whole room up</li>
<li> if I would look at this picture I would say each thing is pretty large, not at all they are very small and theres very little product.</li>
<li> I used with my own liquid and it was complete crap.</li>
<li> it will take over two hours to get off completely where the other stuff would only take a half hour to an hour.</li>
<li> but you can buy actual acrylic liquid, and the three powders seperate for the same price or less.</li>
<li> isn&#x27;t even full its less then half way because it leaked all over everything!!!!</li>
<li> u have to read the description carefully by the picture</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a clear liquid that drys slow.</li>
<li> The powders arent as big as I was thinking and the brush was wayyyy to small</li>
<li> I had to buy other brushes.</li>
<li> The size of the powder containers is very tiny and each is half full :(</li>
<li> The powder is different too, it&#x27;s a harder powder that is noramlly used in chiness salons, that has fiberglass in it, and can be very hard to get off, including soaking off</li>
<li> Not worth it at all!</li>
<li> I do not recommend this product to someone that does not wish to waste their money.</li>
<li> The containers are too small, for each item.</li>
<li> so if it tips over everything slowly pores out...</li>
<li> so i got the kit &amp; i tried using it with the stilettos nails i received &amp; it was so complicated  and messy</li>
<li> I had a very hard time blending.</li>
<li> Total crap for polymer.</li>
<li> was also annoyed because there was no paperwork.</li>
<li> The representation of this product is false.</li>
<li> The liquid does not blend well with the powder and is extremely difficult to apply.  </li>
<li> Not happy at all!!!!</li>
<li> i was a bit disappointed with this set.  </li>
<li> it was terrible and you sent the wrong liquid</li>

    <li> so i got the kit &amp; i tried using it with the stilettos nails i received &amp; it was so complicated  and messy the brush was to small to even apply the acrylic correctly &amp; fumed my whole room up i just wasn&#x27;t as satisfied as i thought i would be very messy too.</li>
    <li> The acrylic settles way too fast. The powders arent as big as I was thinking and the brush was wayyyy to small I had to buy other brushes. Not worth it at all! Might as well go to sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> bought to do my own nails, got tired of paying $ 30 everytime i go for a fill. have a steady hand and proper drill and works out great</li>
    <li> The representation of this product is false. The containers are too small, for each item. I understand the dimensions of the brush but exactly how am I supposed to do a complete full set with that brush. Another thing I cannot seem to process is that instead of acrylicliquid, hand wash was provided instead. This is supposed to be a kit and contain the necessary items to fulfill its purpose. So that was highly dissapointing..</li>
    <li> it was terrible and you sent the wrong liquid it wasnt the nail liquid when i was getting ready to do a clients nails the powder didnt even up  onto the brush. i wasnt happy</li>
    <li> u have to read the description carefully by the picture u think ur getting the stuff the put the acrylic on but is only nail wash</li>
    <li> I am always doing my nails myself and love that I can buy when I need to. And in whatever quantity I want.</li>
    <li> Prive isnt right for this one. Dont mistake the Hand wash bottle for acrylic liquid. The brush is cool i guess, but you can buy actual acrylic liquid, and the three powders seperate for the same price or less. I reccommend you keep looking.</li>
    <li> I Like it, Its Not all that cause i didnt get my 3 there powders only got 2 but its cool powders are really small and powder was every where</li>
    <li> I waited almost a month for this!!! I just got it today and just looking at it the brush is super small so I&#x27;ll have to buy a new one n the liquid don&#x27;t even get me started the bottle isn&#x27;t even full its less then half way because it leaked all over everything!!!! Not happy at all!!!!</li>
    <li> i was a bit disappointed with this set.  the &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; that you get in this &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; was not monomer which is how it was represented when i bought it.  it&#x27;s some other kind of liquid i don&#x27;t even know what it is....but it&#x27;s definitely not monomer...the powders are ok but for the price of the kit i wanted to be able to use EVERYTHING...the plastic dampen dish is ok...it stains easily though if you put colored acrylic powder in it.  i suppose it you were getting this for a beginner it might be ok...but remember the liquid is not monomer...maybe my &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; was just an error but i don&#x27;t really know...</li>
    <li> I would recomment this product! I am satisfied with the pricing as well. The pink powder is a little sketchy, but the others are just fine.</li>
    <li> The liquid does not blend well with the powder and is extremely difficult to apply.  I had a very hard time blending.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it just got it today. Cannot believe how fast I got it! They packed it securely, The powder comes with an extra seal plus packed in a zip lock bag . All canisters where filled to the top and the brush is a little small but very cute and I love that you can use the handle part of the brush as a cap, so after use, you can just snap the metal part of the handle off and store the brush inside of it. I wish the acrylic liquid bottle was bigger  its only 4oz but  so far it seems like a great product at a great price and great speedy service. I do a lot of nail sculpting and 3d nail art, so Im hoping its easy to work with. I will give it 5 stars when I test it out tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Total crap for polymer. Does not send you the actual monomer with the powders. Only brush clener. I used with my own liquid and it was complete crap. Better off going to cosmoprof or salon centric</li>
    <li> WORKS BUT CHEAP PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Everything is super small, and the brush you get isn&#x27;t even the one they show it&#x27;s super tiny and makes doing the acyrlics so much harder and take so my longer then it should... Then then theres the powders they are about the size of my palm, if not smaller. I think the biggest thing is the dipping dish, which dosen&#x27;t even close all the way so if it tips over everything slowly pores out... If i would have known about this i would have gotten this type of thing somewhere else. Also it is not the normal purple liquid that drys fast it&#x27;s a clear liquid that drys slow. The powder is different too, it&#x27;s a harder powder that is noramlly used in chiness salons, that has fiberglass in it, and can be very hard to get off, including soaking off it will take over two hours to get off completely where the other stuff would only take a half hour to an hour.</li>
    <li> i love this kit but the powders are very small! I would order this kit again though. would be a great gift too</li>
    <li> Love love love this, for the price it was great and it works very well&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, the only problem is is that you know they&#x27;re not big size they&#x27;re small size bottles but great product for the price you can&#x27;t complain...</li>
    <li> if I would look at this picture I would say each thing is pretty large, not at all they are very small and theres very little product. I do not recommend this product to someone that does not wish to waste their money.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I was writing about the Acrylic powder kit that was sent to me. The size of the powder containers is very tiny and each is half full :( the liquid is in a tiny bottle &amp; it brings acetone in it? The brush is super tiny. I did not get what I thought I was getting. The information about the product does not represent the true product you are selling. Plus the price is quite high for the product you sold me. I am very unsatisfied with the product. I feel ripped off. Can you send me instructions on how to return the product?</li>
    <li> very helpful, gets the job done, not the loudest odor ever, and very useful. I also loved the pink acrylic!</li>
    <li> So it came in the mail today. I was super happy and excited. I thought the product was open because I could smell it easily through the packaging. It was sealed so just know its strong. I had to put it outside because my living room smelled like it in under two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I was also annoyed because there was no paperwork. I know how to work with acrylic so I will be fine. Im just letting everyone know that if you dont know how to use it, you will have to find instructions online&lt;br /&gt; There was not a shipping invoice,I dont need it butit should have been included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product works great! I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Sets up super fast so not a good product for first timers...didn&#x27;t like that it hardens so quickly, and sometimes doesn&#x27;t set up good...gummy</li>
