      <li>I decided to try out the Relian brand and was very glad</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I believe it will be nice</li>
      <li>The fibres flake off very easily.</li>
      <li>either works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that easy!  </li>
      <li>my lashes are huge using this stuff, and I am very pleased with the price.</li>
      <li>Great product, really like it.</li>
      <li>To me, it just seems to keep any of the fibers from falling off better during the day.</li>
      <li>Repeat as many times as you want to add length</li>
      <li>I need to practice and experiment more.</li>
      <li>This 3D natural fiber lash is amazing the transition is great.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the volume it gives.</li>
      <li>Fabulous product!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>This does lengthen your lashes, gives them more lashes, and makes them darker.</li>
      <li>Even still my lashes were long and wonderful looking.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with this brand too and it was sent quickly and was not dry as some reviews had stated.  </li>
      <li>I did note they do fall into eye if u don&#x27;t put a coat of mascara over them, but easy fix...</li>
      <li>Yet, I loved that I finally appeared to have the kind of eyelashes</li>
      <li>I highly suggest you get a good quality mascare to go with it</li>
      <li>I received one of the name brand high end sample kits for free to try and totally loved them.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I could have used more, but being a first time user, I was and still remain enveloped in trepidation.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a first time user of lash fibers, it&#x27;s kind of flippin&#x27; important.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and does exactly what it says it will.</li>
      <li>Fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Works great, very little flaking (usually my own fault), easy to apply, doubles the thickness of my lashes.  </li>
      <li>I followed directions and watched You Tube videos to make sure I got this on right.  </li>
      <li>However, other reviewers and youtube tutorials were incredibly helpful.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;Washes off very easy with soap and water</li>
      <li>By far, best mascara, friends have Younique, works the same</li>
      <li>Other than that, the effect of this mascara is so beautiful-</li>
      <li>But overall the product is good.</li>
      <li>was easy to use even for a first timer like myself C)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a quick fix, and worth it</li>
      <li>This was totally worth the $12.</li>
      <li>I was so happy and stopped using false lashes unless I had a special event.  </li>
      <li>I finish with regular mascara to lock everything on, many people just use the gel.  </li>
      <li>This works as expected, but to be honest, I was a bit timid with the fibers.</li>
      <li>Some people apply several coats of fiber, but I&#x27;m pleased with one coat.</li>
      <li>I will agree that my eyes pop more because this mascara definitely thickens them at the bottom.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line, for the price, is it better than regular mascara?  </li>
      <li>The fibers do fall onto the upper cheek area, so you will need to make sure to check your face a couple of time per day to wipe them off.</li>
      <li>I did have to get used to using it so the first maybe 2-3 times i used</li>
      <li>This product is JUST AS GOOD as the more expensive alternatives.</li>
      <li>This is amazing mascara, and SO much cheaper than the other fiber extension mascara I was using (Cherry Blooms).</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would have to use as much as I do and there really isn&#x27;t that much in the tubes.</li>
      <li>It made my lashes look really but didn&#x27;t get as much length as I would like</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it to add length which is what I really wanted.  </li>
      <li>the smell is almost to much luck for it that the product works so well, I would suggest maybe investing in an eyelash comb to help spread out your lashes some.</li>
      <li>really helps if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You really should use a lash comb for this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d heard a lot of people raving about Younique fiber lashes, but I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend $30 on a product without trying it.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, followed the instructions posted by another buyer and it works very well.</li>
      <li>Absolutely, however, for bushiness not length.</li>
      <li>I could honestly say i will never go back to regular mascara.</li>
      <li>This is better than the more expensive brands.  </li>
      <li>and this doesn’t really look natural.</li>
      <li>It can be used with or without normal mascara as a primer/base.</li>
      <li>Okay, this product might rate a little higher for me if it weren&#x27;t for the irritation that the fibers cause when they inevitably end up in my eyeballs.</li>
      <li>I’m not overly impressed, but it is an option for those who don’t want to use false lashes everyday.</li>
      <li>But towards the end of the day my eyes are pretty red and itchy because of the fibers dropping into my eyes.</li>
      <li>These made my lashes fun and long.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I looked in my car visor mirror before stepping out to notice black fibers all under my eyes and on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>Overall I liked the mascara but not sure if I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
      <li>I separate my lashes with a clean brush, as usual, and they look very natural.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t actually add much length.</li>
      <li>Works as good as expensive brand</li>
      <li>but after a few times you get pretty fast.</li>
      <li>I did do one final coat of normal mascara at the end.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are easy to use, make my lashes really thick</li>
      <li>I put the mascara in a small jar of hot water while I apply my makeup, and after applying my regular mascara, I apply the included mascara that I had in the hot water, then the fiber coat, then the included mascara again</li>
      <li>they actually work (I have naturally longer lashes</li>
      <li>I love the way it looks and how long and thick my lashes look.  </li>
      <li>is a reasonable price compared to all the other fiber sets out there.</li>
      <li>I was a little worried at first having never used this type of product.  </li>
      <li>If your gel is dry, either add a drop of alcohol or dip the (closed) bottle in hot water and shake it</li>
      <li>That being said, the mascara does make a dramatic difference to my lash fullness and color - making them darker and pop more than my traditional mascara -</li>
      <li>Wait for lashes to dry completely before applying a second coat of gel</li>

<li> Not very natural looking at all.  </li>
<li> Long lashes that you craft the legnth you want &amp; will not be clumpy unless yiu want them to be.  </li>
<li> I will use this mascara for as long as it is made.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m definitely going to try other fiber mascaras instead.</li>
<li> I have used expensive mascara in the past like Givenchy because most mascara irritates my eyes</li>
<li> AND my lashes are very short and not full.  </li>
<li> I guess if you have thin, straight lashes</li>
<li> Lashes NEED to be wet when applying the fibers.</li>
<li> So, I am going to try some other fiber mascara to see if I can find one for the look I want and need.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, really like it. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a different when I put it on, and it flaked off all over my face all day.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Okay, this product might rate a little higher for me if it weren&#x27;t for the irritation that the fibers cause when they inevitably end up in my eyeballs. That being said, the mascara does make a dramatic difference to my lash fullness and color - making them darker and pop more than my traditional mascara - but it doesn&#x27;t actually add much length. Also, the fiber wand is too soft and not brushlike at all, so it haphazardly applies the fibers every which way, making for a clumpy &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34; lashes look. After an hour or so, the fibers start to flake off onto your face and into your eyes - if you dare to apply this to your lower lashes, watch out. Fortunately, I looked in my car visor mirror before stepping out to notice black fibers all under my eyes and on my cheeks. It&#x27;s a quick fix, and worth it I guess if you have thin, straight lashes like I do, but I&#x27;m definitely going to try other fiber mascaras instead.</li>
    <li> Definitely a must buy.&lt;br /&gt;-K.E.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughters (ages 14 and 20). They do not like this product at all. The fibres flake off very easily.</li>
    <li> I like them they actually work (I have naturally longer lashes but this makes them even bigger).  I did note they do fall into eye if u don&#x27;t put a coat of mascara over them, but easy fix...</li>
    <li> I have regular mascara and compare to my regular mascara. This 3D natural fiber lash is amazing the transition is great.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, followed the instructions posted by another buyer and it works very well. I highly suggest you get a good quality mascare to go with it really helps if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE WARNED THE GEL SMELLS HORRID&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars the smell is almost to much luck for it that the product works so well, I would suggest maybe investing in an eyelash comb to help spread out your lashes some.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful.  What doesn&#x27;t stick falls into your eyes and, even some of what sticks falls into your eyes during the day and feels like iron filings in your eye.  It was uncomfortable all day.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once and I think perhaps I didn&#x27;t apply it correctly because the fibers fell off my lashes onto my cheeks. I need to practice and experiment more. I believe it will be nice once I master it.</li>
    <li> Fabulous.  Works as good as expensive brand</li>
    <li> This is amazing mascara, and SO much cheaper than the other fiber extension mascara I was using (Cherry Blooms). The fibers do fall onto the upper cheek area, so you will need to make sure to check your face a couple of time per day to wipe them off. Other than that, the effect of this mascara is so beautiful- my lashes are huge using this stuff, and I am very pleased with the price. Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent and with prime got in 2 days</li>
    <li> Not very natural looking at all.  I encountered a problem with the fibers falling into my eye during the day(I&#x27;m a nurse, that won&#x27;t work).  I think the fiber applicator should have a brush on the end just like the mascara.  The cotton-like applicator for the fibers doesn&#x27;t provide a firm enough brush-on to hold the fibers and real eyelashes in place.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would have to use as much as I do and there really isn&#x27;t that much in the tubes. Will probably only last about a week</li>
    <li> I wanted a big lash look without having to get extensions or fake lash strips. I used the instructions from Agent9er below because the box came with instructions in Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful results! Long lashes that you craft the legnth you want &amp; will not be clumpy unless yiu want them to be.  I used 2-3 coats of fiber/gel.&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Def. lengthens my lashes. I love the volume it gives. But towards the end of the day my eyes are pretty red and itchy because of the fibers dropping into my eyes. Beauty is pain?</li>
    <li> My eyelashes seem so sparse compared to when I was younger.  I was hoping for a miracle with this because of the reviews.  I followed directions and watched You Tube videos to make sure I got this on right.  I will agree that my eyes pop more because this mascara definitely thickens them at the bottom.  However, they also look clumpy close up.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to add length which is what I really wanted.  So, I am going to try some other fiber mascara to see if I can find one for the look I want and need.  Bottom line, for the price, is it better than regular mascara?  Absolutely, however, for bushiness not length.</li>
    <li> Works great, very little flaking (usually my own fault), easy to apply, doubles the thickness of my lashes.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because there were no instructions whatsoever. If you&#x27;re a first time user of lash fibers, it&#x27;s kind of flippin&#x27; important. However, other reviewers and youtube tutorials were incredibly helpful. This works as expected, but to be honest, I was a bit timid with the fibers. I barely have lashes as it is, so just the little bit I used seemed to make a marked difference and improvement upon the appearance of my lashes. I&#x27;m sure I could have used more, but being a first time user, I was and still remain enveloped in trepidation. Yet, I loved that I finally appeared to have the kind of eyelashes I had always been envious of on others. I would recommend this since A) it worked B) was easy to use even for a first timer like myself C) lasted all day &amp; night D) is a reasonable price compared to all the other fiber sets out there. Boom, 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This def works and my only complaint is that it takes a few layers to get the length and you have to be very careful so you dont get clumps but once I got the hang of it I love it!</li>
    <li> It made my lashes look really but didn&#x27;t get as much length as I would like but my lashes did look good. Overall I liked the mascara but not sure if I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;Washes off very easy with soap and water</li>
    <li> What a great value! This product is JUST AS GOOD as the more expensive alternatives. I have a friend that uses the 3D Fiber Lashes that cost $30. My lashes look just as great! Maybe even better! 😉&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had ANY fallout at all. I believe the key is costing the fibers well after applying. I put the mascara in a small jar of hot water while I apply my makeup, and after applying my regular mascara, I apply the included mascara that I had in the hot water, then the fiber coat, then the included mascara again that bonds the fibers and keeps them from falling out. They stayed in place all day. I believe the key is warming the included mascara. Some people apply several coats of fiber, but I&#x27;m pleased with one coat. And no spider lashes! I separate my lashes with a clean brush, as usual, and they look very natural.&lt;br /&gt;This is truly the best value I fiber mascara I&#x27;ve seen. Fabulous product!</li>
    <li> Love it! Very easy to use and does exactly what it says it will. The only thing I do differently is instead of sealing it with the transplanting gel, I just use a coat of regular waterproof mascara. To me, it just seems to keep any of the fibers from falling off better during the day.</li>
    <li> This does lengthen your lashes, gives them more lashes, and makes them darker. However, it is not comparable to false lashes at all and this doesn’t really look natural. There is also quite a bit of fall-out from the false fibers. I’m not overly impressed, but it is an option for those who don’t want to use false lashes everyday.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the fiber lashes but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.  I received one of the name brand high end sample kits for free to try and totally loved them.  I have been wearing false lashes Monday-Friday for over a year.  Finally got fed up with regular mascara AND my lashes are very short and not full.  When I tried the fiber lashes(name brand)they worked!  I was so happy and stopped using false lashes unless I had a special event.  These made my lashes fun and long.  Well then I ran out and refused to spend like $30-$45.  I decided to try out the Relian brand and was very glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to use, make my lashes really thick and then I work on length with a few coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use: DO ONE EYE AT A TIME&lt;br /&gt;1- Use 1 coat of regular mascara&lt;br /&gt;2- Use the gel(like a glue) put it on like mascara&lt;br /&gt;3- Use the fibers all over lashes like mascara (will make lashes thick)&lt;br /&gt;4- Use the gel again focusing on the lash tips&lt;br /&gt;5- Use the fibers on the tips of lashes for length&lt;br /&gt;6- Repeat as many times as you want to add length, I usually do 2-3 times for the average day.  3-4 if I&#x27;m going out at night.&lt;br /&gt;7- I finish with regular mascara to lock everything on, many people just use the gel.  I like using regular mascara but either works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that easy!  Seems like a lot of steps but after a few times you get pretty fast.</li>
    <li> It has a bunch of chinese letters in it. But overall the product is good.</li>
    <li> Just recvied this today. I could honestly say i will never go back to regular mascara. This is awesome.</li>
    <li> This is better than the more expensive brands.  Love it!</li>
    <li> By far, best mascara, friends have Younique, works the same</li>
    <li> I was a little worried at first having never used this type of product.  I LOVE IT.  I have used expensive mascara in the past like Givenchy because most mascara irritates my eyes so I was worried about that as well as never having used fiber mascara before.  I will use this mascara for as long as it is made.  I love the way it looks and how long and thick my lashes look.  I did have to get used to using it so the first maybe 2-3 times i used it were not as great looking as I can produce now.  Even still my lashes were long and wonderful looking.  I am very happy with this brand too and it was sent quickly and was not dry as some reviews had stated.  Just look at the previous reviews for instructions on how to apply this mascara.</li>
    <li> Things I&#x27;ve learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You should use a lash comb for this. Preferably metal.&lt;br /&gt;- It can be used with or without normal mascara as a primer/base. I&#x27;ve used it both ways.&lt;br /&gt;- You can use multiple coats of the transplanting gel and fibers for longer/thicker lashes.&lt;br /&gt;- You really should use a lash comb for this.&lt;br /&gt;- Lashes NEED to be wet when applying the fibers. If your gel is dry, either add a drop of alcohol or dip the (closed) bottle in hot water and shake it up.&lt;br /&gt;- Wait for lashes to dry completely before applying a second coat of gel/fibers.&lt;br /&gt;- Really...use a lash comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it all day and night, didn&#x27;t experience any flaking. Actually, I ended up falling sleep with it...when I woke up, my lashes had clumped together but no fibers on my face or pillows. I did do one final coat of normal mascara at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d heard a lot of people raving about Younique fiber lashes, but I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend $30 on a product without trying it. So I bought this to test a similar product before I purchased Younique. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m in a hurry to try Younique now. This was totally worth the $12.</li>
