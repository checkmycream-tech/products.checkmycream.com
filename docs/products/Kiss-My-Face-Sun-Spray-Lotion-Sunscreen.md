      <li>I liked this sunscreen until both or my spray bottles broke.  </li>

      <li>Sunscreen probably pretty good if you could get to it!</li>
      <li>this is nice, but make sure to unlock it before trying to spray</li>
      <li>I can see how you might have problems if you try to spray very quickly - so don&#x27;t!  </li>

      <li>This sunscreen is very light and does not clog my pores.</li>
      <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>I love the spray nozzle.  </li>
      <li>I love Kiss</li>
      <li>I LOVE this sunblock.</li>
      <li>suggestion if you are trying to decide between this product and Kiss My Face&#x27;s squeeze bottle, don&#x27;t be taken in by the fancy sprayer, buy the squeeze bottle (which I have not tried, but if it has a similar feel to this product it should be great!</li>
      <li>It did get stuck and we had to unscrew the top to get the remaining lotion out.  </li>
      <li>There are better options.</li>
      <li>and I was able to use it on them without any rash developing.</li>
      <li>I keep thinking I&#x27;ll find a better bottle</li>
      <li>I love this spray lotion.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It also does not have that sticky feeling that many sunscreens have.</li>
      <li>Definetely a faulty bottle top.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s actually more of a lotion that squirts out.  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen is all-natural without fragrance, which we love.  </li>
      <li>Some of it ends up in your hand, but more ends up all over the side of the bottle (and anything you happen to be holding the bottle over).</li>
      <li>Love this lotion, love the spray pump, love it, love it, love it.</li>
      <li>i love the bottle since it is non-aerosol</li>
      <li>I even went below the description and checked ingredients to make sure there was no avobenzone.  </li>
      <li>Overall wonderful purchase.</li>
      <li>I had abused my skin for many years and, after a bout with skin cancer, was told that this product would protect my face well if used according to directions(re apply every hour).  </li>
      <li>love the product inside the bottle...should have probably just gotten the tube of lotion, rather than the spray.  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>The smell (very light), rubs in easily with no residue, not sticky, works very well and most importantly a great rating from the EWG regarding product</li>
      <li>Sunscreen seems to work great, but the spray bottle seems cheaply made and broke after first use.</li>
      <li>First the good.</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients and how easy this goes on.</li>
      <li>Love the spray without the aerosol, but the spray nozzle brakes easily</li>
      <li>This is a HUGE problem that many have commented on.</li>
      <li>Now I am able to enjoy the beach again.  </li>
      <li>but so far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
      <li>I love that it is paraben free and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good sunscreen, very light scent, easy to apply, sensitive skin not a problem.</li>
      <li>No parabens or chemicals and easy to put on the kiddos.  </li>
      <li>but it leaks easy if you move the switch locking the handle in place.</li>
      <li>I tried to clean them out and could not get either bottle to work better.</li>
      <li>I thought this sunscreen applied easily because of the lotion consistency and it moisturized my skin</li>
      <li>The spray feature makes it so easy for me to use the lotion on my face/body.  </li>
      <li>And the spray on gives you an easy application without the junk in aerosol.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all about the easy, people.</li>
      <li>but it is so easy to rub in that I forgive it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So, while I think this is a good sunscreen, I can&#x27;t use it at the beach - applying it when it&#x27;s warm and sunny and sandy and sticky just isn&#x27;t possible with this bottle and dispenser.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I liked the product so much with my original purchase that I immediately ordered 2 additional. The problem is with the application pump. After only 3 uses, the pump failed. I transferred the pump from one of my new bottles, however I think there should be a replacement pump available, or some major design changes. Is there anything available?</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the spray bottle clogging but I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I use it mostly on my son and myself and it&#x27;s been spraying quite nicely every day for the past 2 1/2 weeks. It seems liquidy at first but when you start to rub it in it&#x27;s thick like most sun screens and it seems a little lighter too. I love it and we have fun using the spray bottle to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy to finally find a sunscreen made from natural ingredients that WORKS and is so easy to apply! With this sun-spray bottle you easily dispense the right amount of lotion. This makes applying sunscreen much easier than pouring lotion out of a traditional bottle. The lotion glides on smooth and leaves a faint shine on skin, but the residue is not as greasy as other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has a little bit of that sunscreen smell, but it&#x27;s not too strong. You can smell a little rosemary or something that gives a slight fresh scent but nothing overpowering. My friend and I like the smell of sunscreen so we kinda missed that haha :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product because it&#x27;s easy to apply, smells clean, and it works. My friend and I were sight-seeing outside for more than 3 hours and didn&#x27;t need to reapply. Great product, great company, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it two starts because of the texture of the product straight from the bottle. It&#x27;s not crusty like a lot of the natural sunscreens. BUT - it turns your skin white (like most of those containing Zinc) and then washes/runs off as soon as it gets wet or sweaty. There are better options.</li>
    <li> I love this spray lotion. It has physical sun block barriers (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) and is easier to apply than other thick lotions. It is paraben and fragrance free. It is a bit more labor intensive rubbing in the lotion on moving little children but I don&#x27;t mind if my kids have a bit of white sunscreen on them when running around in the sun. I have been using this product throughout this past summer (we live in San Diego) and our family hasn&#x27;t seen a sun burn yet.</li>
    <li> This product has been really great for my 2yo and 6yo kids.  Depending on how hard/quickly you depress the trigger, you can adjust the flow from a spray to a stream.  This is helpful depending on where you are aiming, how much you need, and how quicky your children are running away from you (and you KNOW what I&#x27;m talking about).  The 30 spf has been great - no burns all summer and we spend a lot of time outside.  I love that it is paraben free and the subtle scent is nice.  I tried some other paraben free products this summer but ended up returning them because they were virtually impossible to rub into the skin (too much zinc?) and my kids looked diseased with some sort of a white fungus.  Love this lotion, love the spray pump, love it, love it, love it.</li>
    <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens, and one this works the best. It prevents my skin from burning, which is normally what happens very quickly without suncreen. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It also doesn&#x27;t clog the pores and create zits, which other products do. That&#x27;s 3 out of 3.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping for the spray convenience, but the spray pump stopped working after about 3 uses. just squeeze and squeeze and nothing comes out. The bottle is still full, so I am going to try to rtn it to Whole Foods where I bought it.</li>
    <li> I wanted the convenience of a spray bottle, and for the first few sprays it was great. But then the spray top stopped working right in the middle of our first application. Super annoying. The sunscreen itself seems great, it&#x27;s just a very poorly designed bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is very similar to Elta MD&#x27;s sports spray, but at a fraction of the cost (and twice the volume). There are a couple of things to be aware of before purchasing this: 1) It goes on thicker than expected, almost like a liquefied lotion that you have to rub into your skin.  However- it disappears about 5 seconds after, so no biggie. 2) It leaves NO residue, and only a slight scent (like standard suntan lotion) 3) It works- no burns anywhere after two hours of tennis on a weekly basis. It is not what you&#x27;d expect from a typical spray (where you simply spray it and leave it on). But the fact that it does not contain oxybenzone or avobenzone (although it does have Octinoxate) and protects your skin without any sticky residue-- for me this is a great, everyday product at a reasonable price.  On a comparison note:  I prefer this sunblock to the Kinesys spf 30 spray, which contains Avobenzone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATED 6/27/2012  As other reviewers have indicated, the bottle nozzle is flawed and may stop working (my last two bottles had problems).  As this isn&#x27;t as much of a nuisance to me, I reduced the ratings from FIVE stars to FOUR.  I still stand by the product and would give the lotion itself FIVE stars as I feel this is the best on market, for it&#x27;s value, and would still recommend the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATED 6/25/2016  When I originally purchased this, there was no Avobenzone and the product contained some Titanium Dioxide.  The formula has changed quite a bit since then so not only does my review no longer apply but there are many other sunscreens with superior ingredients that I would choose over this.  It may do a fine job as a sunscreen, but it certainly isn&#x27;t the healthiest. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Before my 7 day vacation in Cancun, I researched long and hard for safe, all natural, non toxic sunscreens. I purchased four before my trip: Kiss My Face, Burnout, Mexitan, and Devita Solar Protective Moisturizer. I liked Kiss My Face the most and made sure to grab this one over the other three to put in my beach bag every morning.     The consistency is perfect. It&#x27;s not too thick or too thin and is easily spreadable. It also absorbs quickly and leaves no white or gray cast on the skin. I have sensitive skin and this caused no reaction whatsoever, even on my face. There was no sign of sunscreen in pictures either. Most sunscreens make you look pale in pics, but this one did not. Frankly it was great and I&#x27;ll be repurchasing for every day use.    The packaging needs some work. It does have a lock on it to prevent leaks. There was no leaks on my way to Cancun, but I also had not even opened the bottle for the first time. The spray is inconsistent so you need to pump it about 10-15 times to get enough product out. After using it every day for two people, the park the sprays out the product just fell off. For the remainder of my trip I had to twist open the top off to use it.     The packaging isn&#x27;t perfect , but it doesn&#x27;t stop me from repurchasing.</li>
    <li> The spray function became clogged rather quickly and we ended up having to unscrew the bottle to use any of the product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is all-natural without fragrance, which we love.  However, I have purchased several of these spray sunscreens and on every one, the spray nozzle broke after just a few applications.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen so far. The bottle works fine, I have no complaints yet. It&#x27;s easy to spray my son a quickly spread the lotion without having to rub hard. It smells ok and if it has zinc as an active ingredient, it should really protect the skin. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased two bottles, both bottles broke on first use.  The sunscreen is good but very difficult to get out of a broken bottle.</li>
    <li> I was about to purchase this product when I noticed it contains Vitamin A.  Isn&#x27;t that linked to an increased risk of skin cancer?</li>
    <li> this is a great sunblock but the sprayer aspect breaks after a few uses. the company has changed the design,-which makes this product a least 4 stars- but the order i received on amazon is the old sprayer. not happy about that!</li>
    <li> This is the second time we&#x27;ve ordered this sunscreen and had the bottle break on us. The pumps stop working, and they get clogged with sunscreen, and that&#x27;s that. The major appeal with this product is the fact that it comes in a spray bottle. I thought the first one was a fluke. Now that it&#x27;s happened twice, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s a problem with the product. Bummer. We&#x27;ll have to find something else.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunscreen for both myself and for my young kids.  It&#x27;s light, easy to spread and tear-free.  My complaint is with the spray bottle.  I purchased two bottles of this and both of the spray mechanisms no longer work.  In the beginning, they would work occasionally if they were primed properly, but after a few uses, they stopped working altogether.  I have since dumped them into a plastic storage container and just scoop it out with my hands.  It works fine at home, but I don&#x27;t choose to travel with it anymore.  Fix the bottle and this sunscreen will be a gem!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out why they decided to make this a spray. The only reason someone purchases spray on sunscreen is to get even coverage without having to rub it in. This not only sprays unevenly, it comes out white, so regardless, you have to rub it in. The pump sprayer is hard to use. The sunscreen itself is fine as far as chemical free sunscreens go. But having it in a spray bottle is just annoying.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen formula is great, not sticky, and not white. But, the sprayer keeps clogging, and I&#x27;m not sure its worth the mess it makes to dump it out in your hands and apply, as it is rather runny. This kind of defeats the &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; purpose.</li>
    <li> love the product inside the bottle...should have probably just gotten the tube of lotion, rather than the spray.  it sprays on white, and the nozzle gets clogged, then breaks.  but, i love the lotion!</li>
    <li> What a great sunscreen, too bad the spray nozzle stops working after ten pumps or so. It gets harder to press until it just won&#x27;t press anymore.  I accidentally squeezed too hard to get it to work and the whole sprayer cracked in half.  I returned the first one, and the second bottle was exactly the same and stops pumping after about one use.  Basically, this product is unusable unless you want to remove the sprayer and just dump it into your hand.  Very disappointed, I really need a good sprayer for my squirmy toddler, but it seems as if they chose the cheapest nozzle manufacturer and it simply does not work.  Save your money.  I&#x27;d give 5 stars if they changed their nozzle.</li>
    <li> The sunblock seems to work great. We bought two bottles to take on vacation. The first bottle sprayed two pumps and stopped working completely. The second bottle stopped spraying a mist after about ten pumps and now just \\&quot;dribbles\\&quot; the sunblock out. I tried to clean them out and could not get either bottle to work better. It almost seems like the lotion is too thick for the cheap sprayer. I read the other reviews and thought \\&quot;Oh well\\&quot;, not realizing how frustrating it can actually be to not be able to just spray the sunblock on. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again until they fixed the bottle. Seriously, it is frustrating.</li>
    <li> I really hate sunscreens that make my skin feel greasy and heavy.  This one felt like a good balance for my skin - especially my acne prone face!  However, I do wish this came in a higher SPF.  I have naturally dark skin, so I tan very quickly and easily (which is not ideal if I&#x27;m already dark enough).  I used this product in the sun for 2 hours (with re-applications every 45 mins) and I ended up four shades darker than when I started - but I didn&#x27;t burn.  I still have not found a sunscreen that prevents me from looking like an overcooked piece of toast.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients and how easy this goes on. I tried it for my first week exposed to sun on a family vacation. Beware- when it says reapply every two hours, it means it. I found that out the hard way.</li>
    <li> just wish it smelled a little better.  it&#x27;s not horrible but the sport spray smelled better, but didn&#x27;t have the great pump that this one has.  wish I could merge the two!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this. When it arrived lotion had leaked out of the bottle, thankfully the bottle was inside a plastic bag so I just washed off the bottle and tried the spray mechanism. It seemed to be working. Then the day arrived that I needed to use it. After the about 5 squirts the sprayer popped off and it no longer works.</li>
    <li> this is not the least bit water or sweatproof, it runs all in my sons eyes everytime! i love the bottle since it is non-aerosol but it leaks easy if you move the switch locking the handle in place. i will use this for myself in a pinch</li>
    <li> I wish I could like this product, and in fact there are some great things about it. It smells inoffensive, not at all chemical or overly scented. I don&#x27;t burn when I use it and it seems to have some staying power in the water. However, I will never buy it again. The dispenser is a nightmare. In a word, the spray bottle doesn&#x27;t spray. If you try to use it, it dribbles white goo all down the bottle, making it slippery and sloppy. Some of it ends up in your hand, but more ends up all over the side of the bottle (and anything you happen to be holding the bottle over). If you get sick of the spray attachment and snap it off, which I did, things improve a little. You&#x27;re left with a tiny pump which drips lotion off and into your waiting hand. It also covers the bottle with the sticky lotion. In short, pain in the butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I think this is a good sunscreen, I can&#x27;t use it at the beach - applying it when it&#x27;s warm and sunny and sandy and sticky just isn&#x27;t possible with this bottle and dispenser. What&#x27;s the point, then? I guess it&#x27;s possible that I got a dud, but I&#x27;m not willing to give it a second chance.</li>
    <li> Something broke internally and the trigger stopped pumping. I guess I could just pour the sunscreen in another small spray bottle. I am past the return period so I might write the company. It doesn&#x27;t matter how good a value it is if it doesn&#x27;t work or makes \\&quot;preping\\&quot; the kids harder.</li>
    <li> The product seemed to work really well.  The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is because I thought it was going to be more of an aerosol and it&#x27;s actually more of a lotion that squirts out.  Otherwise, good product</li>
    <li> Love this product. Even though I read about malfunctions in other reviews, I had no problems with the spray bottle, and used every last drop.  I usually have problems with my skin in the sun, but not with this product.  Always felt my issues were really with the chemicals in the sunscreen and not the sun, itself, and now I am sure that is true.  Now I am able to enjoy the beach again.  I will never use any sunscreen but this one again.  Sold for life.  Can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen is great, neutral smell, light and non-greasy but... the spray nozzle is totally faulty, mine stopped working on the first use. This is a HUGE problem that many have commented on. I don&#x27;t know why the nozzle wont work, it&#x27;s not clogged or physically broken, however it no longer sprays.. very very frustrating and I&#x27;m looking for a good alternative. Can&#x27;t recommend this sunscreen until they get the packaging fixed.</li>
    <li> The trigger spray handle snapped off off this brand new bottle of sunscreen on the very first use. In addition, after reapplying liberally multiple times, we still ended up with sun burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a reliable sunscreen. Do no use on children.</li>
    <li> I like these smaller spray bottles since they&#x27;re easier and lighter to take to the beach than the giant bottle. They spray well, are easy to apply, and work great.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Yes this is spray lotion. I end up spraying on my hands and then rubbing in.</li>
    <li> Loved the lotion and protected well, but the sprayed broke.  I had to open cover and use like regular lotion and it was messy then.</li>
    <li> This was perfect. If your expecting to spray it and not rub it in, don&#x27;t. All it does is disperse it to make it easier to rub in. I love that it soaks in fast and doesn&#x27;t have a chemically smell. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love Kiss My Face&#x27;s commitment to cruelty-free, green cosmetics, but this spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work for this product.  The lotion is a milky white and runny enough to make a mist, but after being tossed around at the beach and in the beach bag, the nozzle becomes difficult to twist to spray, and you end up getting a stream.  The product itself works well.  It is not a sport spray that is a continuous mist; it is a pump spray of a milky lotion.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great, but the bottle is terrible. As mentioned in other reviews, the spray part breaks, and then you are unable to get the product out!</li>
    <li> The spray feature makes it so easy for me to use the lotion on my face/body.  And its portioned so then i do not over use it either. Its long wearing but if gets into water, it WILL sting your eyes!  badly!  So be careful!</li>
    <li> I liked this sunscreen until both or my spray bottles broke.  Here, I see that something like 75% of the reviewers had the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen costs $11 a bottle.  Since the bottle doesn&#x27;t work, Kiss My Face shouldn&#x27;t be selling it.</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles and the spray dispensers on both bottles broke within a week of use. The dispenser ruins the convenience of a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> This product would easily get 5 five stars from me if the bottle wasn&#x27;t so flawed.  I&#x27;ve had this on my subscribe and save list since May (it is August) and all but one of the bottles have broken since then!  It is highly annoying for me because I chose a spray because I have two small children and the spray makes it easier to get them lotioned up quickly.&lt;br /&gt; My youngest has very sensitive skin and other more natural products have made her react this one does not.  Just an FYI it is not tear free so be careful around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Things that I love about this product: The smell (very light), rubs in easily with no residue, not sticky, works very well and most importantly a great rating from the EWG regarding product safety!&lt;br /&gt;So Kiss My Face...get your act together on the bottle!  You have an almost perfect product here!</li>
    <li> The pump spray stopped working soon after I started using it. I like the sunscreen, however, It does not stay any more and the bottle is over half full.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  No parabens or chemicals and easy to put on the kiddos.  I understand what people are saying about it getting clogged.  But I&#x27;ve found that if you CLOSE it after each use (put the lever forward in line with the sprayer) then it doesn&#x27;t.  Towards the end of the bottle it had a hard time coming out but I just took the sprayer off for that last little bit and use my hands.  I&#x27;d have to do that on any bottle with a sprayer anyway.  It didn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;ll definitely get it again, in fact I have it on Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> My beef with the sprayer is that it&#x27;s way too small. I&#x27;m a petite-sized woman and the sprayer is too small for my hand; in fact, I could not operate the sprayer unless i held onto the bottle with my other hand; there&#x27;s just not room to wrap your hand around the sprayer as you normally would. It&#x27;s not well-designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I got the impression when reading about the product that this was a healthy alternative to other sunscreens with harmful ingredients. The website lists a variety of ingredients like aloe, sunflower seed oil, green tea and so on. Yes, these are all INACTIVE ingredients in the sunscreen. HOWEVER, what the website fails to list (unless you think to read the label ingredients by clicking on the back side view of the bottle and then magnifying it) is that the ACTIVE ingredients (listed on the bottle when you get it home) are avobenzone, octinoxate and octisalate. If you&#x27;ve done prior research and determined these 3 ingredients are not something you want to use on your skin, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t perfect.  you have to know there is a nice locking feature that keeps things from spraying while stored.  this is nice, but make sure to unlock it before trying to spray or you may break the linkage.  Also, when spraying you need to pull the trigger fast! too slow and it comes out in a big stream and makes a mess. If you want it to be like a mist when it hits you, you must pull it fast and then simulatneously move the bottle to cover not just one spot.  Kind of like how you might spraypaint something.  And after its sprayed on, you still really need to wipe it in.  rub it in.  Its no good to just spray and hope for the best.  gotta rub it!  I also used it just a little at a time on my finger and then rubbed it into my ears and nose, cheeks.  Definitly sped up the application of sunscreen on the little tykes!  rubs in nice.  not water proof though!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t spray the sunscreen directly on my kids but in my hand instead, then rub onto their bodies. It&#x27;s easy to apply, thin and so far they haven&#x27;t been sunburned through several days of only one application before nap and one after. I&#x27;ve only had it about a month so I can&#x27;t speak to the issue of the sprayer clogging up over time but so far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
    <li> Good sunblock. Sprayer gets clogged though.</li>
    <li> I recently received this sunscreen in the mail and I loved it.  It sprays on light and spreads like a lotion without the residue of a heavy sunscreen.  It does not feel tacky or have a residue feel to it. You don&#x27;t have to keep rubbing it to get the white residue off like other sunscreens and it won&#x27;t leave a heavy smell either.  It does have a sunscreen smell but it is very light and will go away. I used it on my kids all summer without any problems.  My children have very sensitive skin and I was able to use it on them without any rash developing. The only negative is the spray nozzle. It did get stuck and we had to unscrew the top to get the remaining lotion out.  Otherwise a great product and would not hesitate to recommend or buy again.  My whole family uses it and it has replaced our old sunscreen brand!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good sunscreen that is not full of chemicals and this one was high of the list.  I gave it a try and loved it!  I love the spray nozzle.  Aerosol cans freak me out with the stuff they have to put in it.  I saw some comments of people saying it was to thick or they would get white streaks from it, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem.  I was training for my 2nd Half Ironman all summer so I was outside for long periods of time and I never got a burn using this sunscreen.  Its a great product!</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and  breaks out with some sunscreens, but this one is PABA free so decided to give it a try while on vacation.  The sunscreen itself is wonderful, but the spraybottle quit working after only a few uses.  I happened to have an empty spray bottle with me and transferred the contents into it which worked well. To sum it up....would give the sunscreen itself 5 stars.  Would give 0 stars for the poor container.  The manufacturer needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with a spray bottle that will make the product an overall perfect purchase for their customers.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen as two of the ingredients I DIDN&#x27;T want (the avobenzone and one other I forget) but it is so easy to rub in that I forgive it.  I often miss spots and end up with weird sunburns but this spreads so well that I haven&#x27;t had a really random streaky sunburn since I bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought this upon advise from my dermatologist.  I had abused my skin for many years and, after a bout with skin cancer, was told that this product would protect my face well if used according to directions(re apply every hour).  After a vacation in Jamaica and another in Florida  enjoying many days of snorkeling,  My face was fine despite much exposure to the sun.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this sunscreen. Our biggest irritation with barrier sunscreens is that they are messy to apply to wiggly children. It ends up getting on clothes, furniture, car seats, and everything else. I still insist on this type of sunscreen for our family for health and safety reasons. This sunscreen went on smoothly and rubbed in well, which was fantastic. However, both of my children broke out in red rash on their face and body after application. I&#x27;m still planning to use it for myself, but need to find a non-iritant sunscreen for the kids.</li>
    <li> The Sunscreen worked good but the spray bottle did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00142DXXE Kiss My Face Sunspray Lotion SPF 30, 8 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I live in San Diego, I swim year round in open water, I drag my family along and especially my 10 year old daughter.(because the outdoors is good for her and she&#x27;ll have fun even if I have to force her. repeat a million times) I have tried too many sunblocks to list and finally settled down to research and selected a few that I love. I really wanted a spray for Ali (reluctant child) but intensely dislike the sport sprays, they smell awful, they are very wasteful, spread everywhere in a 6&#x27; radius, can&#x27;t be used on the face and can sting delicate skin. High alcohol content too. I chose Kiss My Face as it&#x27;s highly rated by EWG and Cosmetic Cop, it&#x27;s a spray, a good deal and waterproof. I love the sunscreen, it&#x27;s a beautiful liquid, spreads easily, dries quickly leaving a very faint white cast but makes skin look creamy and moisturized and it is totally water resistant-you may need to use a stick over it on nose, cheeks, ears just to really be protected-but the bottle! It&#x27;s the worst bottle ever, it leaks from the nozzle, sprays out in a weak little squirt and at the same time splashes about 3&#x27; all around whatever you are spraying thus splashing your new Dooney &amp; Bourke handbag. Bad bottle! Also, the nozzle is non adjustable and clogs immediately after use. I keep thinking I&#x27;ll find a better bottle but I forget and use the sport stick which is super easy. It&#x27;s all about the easy, people. If the kid thinks &#x27;icky&#x27; sunblock is going to keep her in front of the XBOX, she&#x27;s going to have to be more creative. All seasoned parents know this.</li>
    <li> Could&#x27;ve been a great product. I&#x27;ll never know since the spray bottle portion didn&#x27;t work for long!</li>
    <li> I like the way this sunscreen goes on but the pump broke after one of the first uses.  We ended up having to unscrew it and pour the lotion In our hands.  I have had this problem with the other kiss my face sunscreens with sprays and pumps.  With a broken pump it is almost useless and a waste.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked great, was easy to apply, obviously didn&#x27;t wash off too badly in the water, and kept my kids from getting sunburned (or even very tan).  I&#x27;ll use it again next summer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunblock. It feels so thin and not greasy at all!</li>
    <li> I still burnt.  But I am pregnant and I have heart it is easier to burn when you are pregnant.  I will still buy this one though.  I hate the idea of using chemicals on my body.  Just beware to reably a lot.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time - at the beach, the pool, on campus, on field trips, and on hikes. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the spray nozzle - works just as well as the day it arrived (I&#x27;ve had this bottle for about 10 months). The only recommendation I would give is to spray the sunscreen in your hand first, then apply. The sunscreen is a little too thick for misting on and you&#x27;ll only end up splattering everyone around you if you spray it directly on. I bring it out in the field with me on all my geology field trips and my classmates often ask to use it. So far, everyone likes the light smell and the good protection it offers.</li>
    <li> Love the spray without the aerosol, but the spray nozzle brakes easily so I replace it with spray nozzles from other bottles.  The product itself goes on smooth and spreads easily without being too thick.  The kids don&#x27;t mind when I use this sunscreen on them either and it&#x27;s reviewed as one of the safest ones.</li>
    <li> I order this for our home, camper, and summer school.  We love this product for the whole family.  No better sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Prefer spray ons so this is great. Best protection for me in Cayman Islands where the sun WILL get you.</li>
    <li> Sunscreen seems to work great, but the spray bottle seems cheaply made and broke after first use. Got another bottle and is fine.</li>
    <li> The very best sunscreen ever!! My kids have very sensitive skin and are very fair in complexion so a good sunscreen is a must! This is the only one we use. And the spray on gives you an easy application without the junk in aerosol. Goes on no greasy and rubs in right away. Superior protection. Can&#x27;t recommend it any higher.</li>
    <li> I purchased this recently for my vacation. The product itself worked well, but after 1 day, the pump spray cracked and broke. I bought 2 bottles thinking it was a defect on one and it happened to that one too!</li>
    <li> I like Kiss My Face products and do my best to buy safe, effective, fragrance- and cruelty-free products. I generally consult EWG ratings in addition to Amazon ratings, and this one passed muster. All that said, this spray was a HUGE disappointment. I was looking for something easy to apply and a bit less expensive than the Face Factor for use on my chest and arms. It applied fine, but proved quite ineffective - I turned red/pink even after short sun exposures. I won&#x27;t buy this one again. (And I would love suggestions from others for fragrance-free light and/or spray sunscreens appropriate for daily wear).</li>
    <li> I really want this product to work. The lotion itself is great and when the bottle worked- for the first application- the spray was great. But just like last season, when I went to apply on the 3rd person, the spray trigger of the bottle snapped right off. We have been trying to screw it back together and get it to work to no avail. Super FRUSTRATING as kiss my face (on it&#x27;s recent responses to reviews) said the bottle is redesigned. I wish they could get it right!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always slacked on applying sunscreen because it was so time consuming.  I LOVE the spray bottle as I get non-aerosol lotion in a quick application.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve got the newest non-clogging nozzle or not (as previous reviews stated, the old ones stop up, which was a concern for me), but I rinse the nozzle off after every use and it has not clogged yet.</li>
    <li> Much like many other reviewers the spray mechanism broke after a couple of uses.  Now we have to put some on our hands but it&#x27;s difficult because it&#x27;s runnier than most sunscreen, since it&#x27;s designed to come out of a sprayer...  Really bad sprayer design.</li>
    <li> The bottle was 3/4 full when the pump started to get gunked up.  Also, this is too expensive. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> First the good. This sunscreen is very light and does not clog my pores. It also does not have that sticky feeling that many sunscreens have. It applies smoothly and then you can forget that you are wearing it. I especially like it for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eh- Make sure you note that this product is only water resistant. You must reapply every forty minutes if you are swimming or involved in an activity where you sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad- First I think this product is a little over priced. I can pay a bit more and have a giant bottle of sunscreen. However, for how nicely it applies I would be willing to buy the product again, if it were not for one thing...the bottle. Brand new the sprayer is horrible. You&#x27;d expect an even stream, right? No, you get a concentrated jet stream, that makes it pointless to have the sprayer. I ended up spraying the lotion into my hand to apply. Well, that is what I did until the sprayer broke, after about three uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion if you are trying to decide between this product and Kiss My Face&#x27;s squeeze bottle, don&#x27;t be taken in by the fancy sprayer, buy the squeeze bottle (which I have not tried, but if it has a similar feel to this product it should be great! I plan on trying it next).</li>
    <li> This is a great product - very nice sunscreen and effective. However, the nozzle on the bottle broke almost immediately upon using it, thus rendering it very difficult to even use the product. This caused me to cancel my automatic subscription from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this sunscreen after reading good reviews about the product. However, after using the lotion a couple of times, the spray function doesn&#x27;t work.  What a waste of money.  They need to redesign the bottle and fix the nozzle.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and assumed that others must have been too rough with the bottle or that it was random that the pump broke. We brought this on vacation and we all loved it- not too greasy, rubbed right in, and smelled/felt great.  On day 2, the pump broke. I secretly blamed my husband. We got home and (sucker) bought another bottle, thinking that I would be more careful. Guess what?! The pump broke. Come on, Kiss My Face, fix the bottle!!!</li>
    <li> You can control the size of the spray easily, and it rubs in quickly without leaving white pasty stuff everywhere, as some other sprays of this type can do. Seems to work!</li>
    <li> Burns the eyes.  It sprays nicely and spreads easily, provides moderate sun protection.  But as stated above, I can&#x27;t use it on my face because it causes much stinging to the eyes.  Very unfortunately-named product.</li>
    <li> I love the bottle design! I haven&#x27;t had it break like some reviews caution, even if it did, I&#x27;d still give this product five stars. It&#x27;s good sunscreen, very light scent, easy to apply, sensitive skin not a problem. Overall wonderful purchase.</li>
    <li> I got this since it is is safe, minimal additives.  The spray does work, and i&#x27;ve not had any problems with it clogging or breaking (including being in checked baggage twice ad surviving).  This is a thin lotion however that seems kind of watery.  It doesn&#x27;t rub in as a thicker lotion will.  However, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with coverage or streaking and i used it on my 1 year old as well.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this consistency, however I did like the results...</li>
    <li> This sunblock lotion served its purpose well on my last beach vacation to Mallorca. You have to follow the guideline of putting at least 1 oz of it and reapply after a couple of hours and/or going for a swim. It&#x27;s also important to apply at least 15 minutes before one goes out in the sun. My thoughts in general after using this sunscreen a couple of times:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- I thought this sunscreen applied easily because of the lotion consistency and it moisturized my skin alright&lt;br /&gt;- No weird/unpleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;- Has some antioxidant in the ingredients&lt;br /&gt;- Did not leave a noticeable white cast on my medium skin tone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I wish the active sunscreen ingredients were all mineral based, but I did not have any adverse reaction&lt;br /&gt;- Would not recommend for the face if you have oily, acne-prone skin because of the moisturizing ingredients&lt;br /&gt;- The nozzle seems fragile, especially if it gets knocked around in the bag. I could imagine why people have complained about this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, my skin did not get burned by the sun while using this sunscreen, but it did get considerably darker (normal for me to get a bit darker even when I have sunscreen on) since I could not always reapply after 2 hours.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the fact that it&#x27;s natural. I only use this for my toddler and when it&#x27;s sunny out.</li>
    <li> I have a severe allergy to Avobenzone and Oxybenzone and I choose to buy this sunscreen based on the listed ingredients. the description of this lotion makes it seem as if the only sunscreen was Zinc Oxide. I even went below the description and checked ingredients to make sure there was no avobenzone.  THEY ARE INCORRECT!! When the product arrived to me the first listed ingredient is Avobenzone! HUGE oversight Amazon!! AND to make matters worse this product is non returnable!</li>
    <li> Love this product - I would absolutely buy again.  Spray goes on nicely and is not greasy.  Spent all day at the beach and did not get burned.</li>
    <li> VERY easy to apply and became nonvisible right after you rub it around. this will probably be the sun lotion I use from now on</li>
    <li> Guess I should have read the reviews first! Definetely a faulty bottle top. Sunscreen probably pretty good if you could get to it! Bought it for the ease of sunblocking 3 kids and not taking 1/2 hour!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last and doesn&#x27;t work very well.  Reapplied every hour and still got a sunburn, and I rarely burn without sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Lotion is ok but the sprayer stopped spraying before we had used a third of the lotion.</li>
    <li> This sunblock is everything I&#x27;ve been looking for!  I don&#x27;t get what folks are complaining about with regard to the nozzle.  We previously used aerosol spray type sunblock.  I knew they weren&#x27;t good for you or the environment, but they are darn convenient.  After some research, I accepted that any healthier version of sunblock would involve getting my hands dirty and some smearing... we were already getting messy when we got about half way through the other kind because the nozzle would clog.  Despite complaints here about the spray nozzle, I decided to try it.  We haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.. but we spray it very slowly.  I can see how you might have problems if you try to spray very quickly - so don&#x27;t!  We use it every day, so it doesn&#x27;t dry up or clog up between uses.  It is not very heavy or greasy - it rubs on smoothly and easily.  It has a slight scent at first that dissipates quickly.  Blocks sun very well, no sunburns.  I don&#x27;t think it lasts as long as some of the aerosol/other brands - but again, that is a trade off for a healthier product - just reply it.</li>
    <li> I have very sun-sensitive skin and I&#x27;m allergic to the chemical sunblocks. This seemed like a great option since I could spray it on. There are a few others on the market but they are much more expensive. The nozzle on the bottle broke after one or two sprays. I ended up transferring the lotion to a drug-store spray bottle but the lotion was too thick for that. So in the end I just poured it out and spread it on. A bit liquid-y but I have not been burned all summer and I love how this sunscreen isn&#x27;t tacky feeling like many other zinc-based lotions are. I wish the bottle would be improved but I will buy this product again, for sure.</li>
