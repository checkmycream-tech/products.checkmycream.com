    <li> My mother has a pair of scissors like this that she purchased 30 years ago and they are amazing. Hers were by Revlon and made in Italy. I swear these scissors are the exact same ones. Although it doesn&#x27;t have the Revlon name, they are made in Italy and have the same exact shape. They are very well built and have a smooth cutting action. The blades are very sharp. I use them to cut my baby&#x27;s nails and they do a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> Great pair! Sharp and nice narrow point for tiny areas.</li>

    <li> not as sharp I would have liked</li>
    <li> Sharp and pointy enough to remove cuticles at it&#x27;s best.</li>
    <li> Very sharp &amp; excellent alignment.  Excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> This is the best quality scissors I have ever bought. It is sharp and precise and has a nice weight. Revlon used to make this quality, but impossible to find now. Glad I gave this one a try.</li>
    <li> Great little pair of cuticle scissors, very sharp. Making your cuticle overgrowth cutting much easier, faster with close cutting edge.</li>
    <li> great scissors for cuticles. very sharp, so be careful until you get used to it. good quality steel. I had nice Sephora scissors before, they lasted for years. these are just as good or better. if you are using some $5 drugstore scissors now and think they are all the same, trust me, they are not. i recommend getting stainless steel cuticle pusher and use that first then scissors. of course it is best to use right after a bath or a long shower</li>
    <li> I have worked with fine microsurgical tools, and needed a replacement for my cuticle scissors after they were confiscated at airport security.  I was concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t find quality scissors, but after reading reviews, decided to try these.  I am happy to say they are well made, sharp, and do the job.</li>
    <li> Good pair of scissors. The craftsmanship is really good. And I hope to have this for a long, long time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> A+++ It took a while to accept the high cost of the scissor when I was shopping.  These are very well made, very precise and sharp.  I have used about a year without any problems and am very happy with them.  For the cost I hope I don&#x27;t need to replace them anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Best scissors!! Work well</li>
    <li> The best cuticle scissor I have ever used. Not only are they stainless steel, they are super sharp with a precision cut. Being stainless steel they will never rust and should last and last and never need replacing.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Particularly for the price.</li>
    <li> These are okay, but not great.  I have managed to trim my cuticles; however, I think less pointy would have worked better.  I did not bother to try to return them simply because it was an aggravation.</li>
    <li> These cuticle scissors bind at the tip &amp; do NOT cut cuticles</li>
    <li> like everyone else says, great for cutting off excess skin, just make sure not to poke yourself since the end is pretty pointy.</li>
    <li> Although these cuticle scissors are a bit pricey, they are worth it. Ultra fine tip and excellent quality stainless steel.</li>
    <li> I will not tweeze my eyebrows or facial hair, so I use scissors. My old ones were great but now no longer cut. These are very sharp without hurting. Probably, though, I would have been better off with scissors that were not curved. Still, they do the job well. They are also very comfortable to hold.I don&#x27;t use them for cuticles. I imagine they would work very well for that.</li>
    <li> Excellent, bought one pair and came back for another.</li>
