      <li>Fair, but not as good as I thought it would be.  </li>

      <li>It gives my eye lashes just the right touch and makes them look naturally beautiful.</li>
      <li>It sets like magic in lashes,it&#x27;s a gel kind of formula.</li>
      <li>I think it will be perfect for the summer and hotter months since it is a more natural looking mascara.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only problem with this is the smell! I bought it on a recommendation and I absolutely love it! I added some scented liquid and it smells perfect now.</li>
    <li> Great lengthening mascara! I layer this under Maybelline&#x27;s Falsies in waterproof and I almost look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried more exspensive brands like MAC false lashes &amp; find this to be comparable for half the price. It stays put all day &amp; is easy to wash off unlike waterproof mascaras.</li>
    <li> Maybelline New York Lash Stiletto Ultimate Length Washable Mascara in Very Black gives you a dramatic, smooth set of lashes. I&#x27;ve never experienced any clumps while applying and the totaly effect is fabulous. I was due for a new mascara and tried this one for the first time. I will definitely be back for more, because it didn&#x27;t smear, flake or run in the heat and humidity. It&#x27;s about the best you could ask for in a washable mascara!</li>
    <li> I use this mascara everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Lancom, Helena Rubinstein, Clinique... Among those, this is the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are not full, but each hair is long, so I wanted a mascara to emphasizes each one, and separate them also.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara does exactly what I want for my lashes. And it does not make my eyes look like a panda at the end of the day. It has minor flaking, but it is very unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and great effect keep making me a repeater for several years. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I usually love this stuff, but this one I received tended to clump on my lashes.  This product never did that in the past, therefore I will try it again but will  buy it locally.  Whether this will make a difference is anyones guess.</li>
    <li> Very good product,exactly what I was looking for, would like to buy more, will recommend Maybelline Stiletto 951,its the best on the market today.Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lancome mascara for years.  This wears exactly like it and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This product is very runny, burns your eyes and leaves a thick black coat on your eye and if you wear them, contacts. It did not do as it claims in the ad, it covered lightly. To get any kind of coverage you had to apply multiple times and by the time it was covering it was clumpy and messy looking. Avoid!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this the best mascara out there. It really helps to lengthen your eyelashes but also while giving them a little bit of volume. Very black always leave a very good look but I&#x27;m sure the other colors are nice as well. Beware to those of you who are considering buying waterproof.. very difficult to remove! I would have to pull the mascara off of my eyelashes, resulting in many eyelashes being pulled out. This mascara is fantastic however!</li>
    <li> I needed a new mascara, so I thought I would try this one. I don&#x27;t really have any complaints, it does what it should do. It does not make my lashes any longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the others have experienced, but I&#x27;ve tried several types of mascara from Clinique, Lancome, Sephora brand, Cover Girl and many others and still find (non-waterproof) Stiletto by Maybelline to be one of my favorite mascaras. It lengthens like crazy and as an extended wear contact lens wearer who has eyes that are very sensitive to irritants, I have had no problems with flaking or other issues some reviewers say they have encountered. For $8-10 (cost in the drugstore or Target), this is one of my favorite go-to mascaras for everyday or dressing up.</li>
    <li> This mascara makes your eyelashes POP.  Great product, but you will have to replace every month as it dries out easily.</li>
    <li> This mascara provides no volume at all, and looks terrible on me. It separated my lashes so much that it looks like I hardly have any.</li>
    <li> I chosed it becous i love it ,&lt;br /&gt; I have tryed many others but this is the best&lt;br /&gt;The stores in Sweden don´t sell it anymore&lt;br /&gt;I hope they don´t stop to do it</li>
    <li> Mascara was completely dried out. Not even usable, so I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different mascaras. I already have pretty long lashes and most products weigh them down. I love this one. It&#x27;s quite light weight and even if you arnt wearing water proof it does not smudge.  It&#x27;s all I will buy and the price here is grate. I pay almost $9 at local stores. My only complaint about it is that the formula is it very thick so if you want to beef up your lashes you have to apply several coats which obviously makes it run out faster.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara. No clumps, makes my lashes look long, and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I love stiletto mascara best one ive used that gives lenght,volume, speartes my lashes n no clumps. I cant wait to order it them again!  And i got a great price.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Maybelline Lash Stiletto has a brush that grabs just enough of the mascara that it really covers on the first coat! It is a good quality mascara or it wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this, either. The brush distributes the mascara without clumping the lashes together. They have a good deal more volume and look a good deal longer. This is one of the better drug-store brand mascaras I have tried. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally long thick eye lashes and as a woman I want to  keep it looking that way and of all the mascaras I have used over the years this is by far the best. It&#x27;s not clumpy or thick. It gives my eye lashes just the right touch and makes them look naturally beautiful.</li>
    <li> Makes my eyelashes look spindly and not full at all. Very thin looking after use and I have pretty thick and long lashes. Didn&#x27;t like this brush.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great for my long fine lashes. Really helps them hold a curl and stays on really well, even after swimming - yet it comes off easily with waterproof mascara remover.</li>
    <li> The name fits the products. My lashes looked longer, but very very thin. I have been using it as a base with another brand over the top to thicken. The wand is also very long which makes it a bit awkward. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I wanted a less expensive mascara and went back to Maybelline after many years with a department store product. I&#x27;m picky about the applicator brush and this one works well.  Mascara goes on smoothly. Some flaking of the regular (not-waterproof) version after hours of wearing.  Washes off with soap or a facial wash.  I do wear contacts and have had no problem using it.</li>
    <li> i tried this on a recommendation and love it so I won&#x27;t keep looking for the perfect mascara, I found it!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite mascara! Makes my lashes look long and thick, washes off easily yet somehow stays on great!</li>
    <li> Every once in a while I like to try a new mascara, so I decided to try this one.  It went on nicely enough, but when I got to work I felt like I had something in my eye.  I did!  Hunks of flaky mascara.  As the day wore on, my mascara wore OFF!  By the time I got home from work, there was little to remove.  I would not buy this product again nor would I suggest it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great value offered on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it gives me a nice long lash that is natural looking and clean. I have not found any other mascara I like as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me but this mascara killed my lashes. I have very strong, think and long lashes and usually have no problems with mascara. However, when I ran out of the kind I usually use, I decided to experiment with another type of mascara. I use Maybelline&#x27;s liquid eye liner and it is perfect and I highly recommend it, that&#x27;s why I decided to try out this mascara. When I applied the mascara, my lashes clumped together and seemed somehow shorter than before. It dried very quickly and throughout the day, my eye lashes felt very sensitive and I removed it immediately when I got home. SO many of my lashes fell out and the mascara wouldn&#x27;t come off even when I used make up wipes. I couldn&#x27;t wear mascara for many days after using this once. I normally do not have trouble with mascara so this was a first for me. Buy at your own discretion.</li>
    <li> It works so well by, lengthening my lashes, giving my lashes volume, etc.!&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much and I think that everyone should experience the wonderful mascara.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  Way cheaper here than at Ulta!!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. It looks good on my Latisse lashes!!  No clumping and it grabs each lash perfectly!  Buy it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara. Makes my lashes look longer then they are. My only complaint would be that I feel like the tube started to dry out quicker than usual.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product and my wife loved him .. also a good price</li>
    <li> No staying power! It starts flaking onto my face in two minutes. This is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> Received product on time and in good condition.  I would buy from this seller again.  The product is good. It does make my lashes look longer, however I wish it made them thicker.  I will have to get another mascara that promotes thickening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now.  Happy to see it was on Amazon and was shipped directly to me.  Santa put it in my stocking for me.  LOL</li>
    <li> I have never been devoted to one brand of mascara until now. This stuff works! I love how long it makes my lashes look. Plus, the washable comes off well with makeup remover. If you&#x27;re looking for something a little more makeup remover resistant, go for the water resistant version of this.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I stray from this mascara, but I always come back to it.</li>
    <li> If what you look for in a mascara is LOTS of length and MAXIMUM separation that makes your lashes look so perfect people will think you glued them on, this is for you!!  It&#x27;s been my new favorite since they discontinued Maybelline Lash Expansion.  They always have to go changing a great thing.... but this is an even BETTER substitute, and it doesn&#x27;t clump on me!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TRY THIS AWESOME MASCARA!</li>
    <li> No lump, no clump, no smudge and it stays on.What culd be better?</li>
    <li> Fair, but not as good as I thought it would be.  It clumps and it isn&#x27;t as good as Covergirl Clump Crusher.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this.  It lengthens her lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easily....she lets first coat dry and then puts on another...no clumping.&lt;br /&gt;Uses neutrogena make up removal and let sit for 15 seconds and the mascara comes off easily with a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;No greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just really impressed that this mascara made my lashes like literally 3x longer ( I have very short lashes, by the way) and it looks very natural as the consistency is just right. Not too thick. It&#x27;s also very easy to remove unlike other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past. Not flaky at all.</li>
    <li> definitely only a lengthening and not thickening but it works great for what it is supposed to do - not to mention that the packaging is the cutest ever.</li>
    <li> Always bought this before finding it on Amazon! Nice mascara!</li>
    <li> Still the best mascara i have ever used!</li>
    <li> First off, I have to say I LOVE the smell of this. It smells exactly like roses. I guess everyone wants that chemical smell in their mascaras, as the smell is one of the things I see most complained about. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger and you can&#x27;t smell it after a few minutes, so don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t like the smell of roses.    Anyways, the actual mascara is great! It doesn&#x27;t have much clumping, which I love, and gives VERY nice length, but without very much volume, but I can live with that. It didn&#x27;t really make my lashes \\&quot;shiny\\&quot;, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t a purely matte finish.    You have to use it though, and quickly, within a month I noticed it would burn when I applied it, and the brush was getting worn-out. But that first month it was great, and I bought it again when it went bad.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my favorite mascara. Does what it says. I have longer lashes and it lasts all day. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Kind of dry probably it was in storage for to long</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. It did not meet my expectations. It had no staying power and no significant lengthening.&lt;br /&gt;I wont buy again and I cant in good concience recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mascara as well as another different Loreal mascara because I just wanted to try something new. This mascara isn&#x27;t bad. I like it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my eye lashes feeling sticky as other Maybelline mascaras have. The brush is big enough for the top lashes and small enough for the bottom ones. It isn&#x27;t a volume mascara, but I did not purchase it for that in hopes that it would give my eye lashes these plumped, full figured appearance. I have found that with mascaras that claim to add volume, they start to clump after a few hours and I rather not deal with black specks in my eyes. Overall I like it. I think it will be perfect for the summer and hotter months since it is a more natural looking mascara.</li>
    <li> This must have been an old product or something because I have had no problems in the past with this mascara. This one was not the same. I&#x27;m thinking it was old....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Maybelline mascara in the pink tube with the green cap works much better. This stuff doesn&#x27;t thicken, just extends a little.</li>
    <li> I must say this is one of the best mascaras I have ever used. Other mascaras I have used in the past gave me eye infections or they would clump up too quickly, or they did not do what they said they would on the tube. This mascara goes on smooth and it separates my lashes. No clumping whatsoever. Really good product.</li>
    <li> Have loved it for years.. Now have it on auto replenish</li>
    <li> Does a good job at lenghtening your eyelashes, but leaves a spidey effect to them.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> This mascara really made my eyelashes longer. They aren&#x27;t clumped at all either. It is a little harder to get off than what it says but that&#x27;s to be expected with any masacara. Overall a great product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I like... it doesn&#x27;t clump and it kind of stretches out if you put on a few layers.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package the mascara was completelty dried out I couldnt even use it. Complete Waste of money</li>
    <li> I chose this item after reading the reviews.  I was so very happy when I used it.  I now have lashes I didn&#x27;t know were there.  I am an older woman with diebetes who has lost a lot of hair on my body.  I thought that was why mascara did not work for my once very long lashes.  I am so happy with this product.  I don&#x27;t understand why the others can&#x27;t do the same thing.  I will continue buying as long as it works for me. It did magic for me.</li>
    <li> Absolute all time favorite mascara.  Adds length without clumping up or matting.  l have this automatically sent through subscribe and save every other month so I always have a fresh supply.automatically sent through subscribe and save every other month so I always have a fresh supply.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing the mascara for years and I hope they never discontinue it.  I put it on autoship and get a better price than Walmart.</li>
    <li> I think this mascara makes an awesome work.Just put 2 layers or so,it dries while you make your other eye.It sets like magic in lashes,it&#x27;s a gel kind of formula.This is like that \\&quot;Full&#x27;n&#x27;Soft mascara\\&quot;.Makes lashes look incredible,if you know how to use it.Just have to find those good turns in every mascara.Lash Stiletto is one of the best,and I do have tried all the \\&quot;good\\&quot; and \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ones. Please do buy and try !</li>
    <li> I love the look I get from this mascara. It&#x27;s really great and it puls my lashes out.the only thing is I wish it had a little note volume but it definitely lengthens!!</li>
    <li> use it as a top coat to extend my lashes...at least 2-3mm of length</li>
    <li> The mascara went on fine and did a nice job of defining my long lashes, but after a couple hours, I had black specks under both eyes... I guess that every time I blinked, some of the product flaked off.  I&#x27;m disappointed because I really liked the way it looked (before it turned me into a raccoon).</li>
    <li> This is really fantastic mascara. It lengthens my eyelashes without clumping and I will buy this again. It also washes off pretty easy. I don&#x27;t notice any fallout unless of course I rub my eyes.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever.  I normally buy Lancome. This is just as good to me!</li>
    <li> fake rose sent is very strong.  I don&#x27;t consider myself smell sensitive soI tried to suck it up and just get used to it, but each time i&#x27;d bring it up to my eye i&#x27;d get a whiff and have to take a step back.  Not great when you&#x27;re leaning into a mirror trying to do detail work with this teeny brush.&lt;br /&gt;Chucked it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Maybelline makes wonderful products and this one is no exception. If you know what your doing this and the Clossal volum express can make you look like you have on flash eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I would have rated this mascara with four stars if it was great on its own, but unfortunately this mascara is only great when accompanied by a volumizing mascara for the base coat.  When I use the product alone I am not satisfied with the spidery lashes look.  When I use a different mascara as a basecoat, then I am pleased with the appearance of long defined lashes that the two mascaras combined create. Being a busy mother, I usually put on a couple of mascara coats and go and am not pleased about having to pull out two mascaras when trying to get ready in a hurry.  I have been using the mascara for a month and would say that my lashes do appear slightly longer.  I will buy this product again and continue to use it because I am pleased with the end result.  This mascara does not run easily nor is it clumpy.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT CLUMP UP, DARK AND EASY TO REMOVE-IT IS NOT WATERPROOF SO NOT TO USE IF GOING SWIMMING OR YOUR EYES WATER EASILY THEY DO HAVE WATERPROOF BUT I WANTED THE EASY TO REMOVE MASCARA</li>
    <li> This mascara sucks and it has a weird smell to it. I can smell it all day when I wear it. I have super long eyelashes and it doesnt seem to make them &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; Also-it doesnt last!</li>
    <li> Long, lovely lashes. What more do you want?</li>
    <li> This mascara is average. The design is very appealing, however, I prefer to use my Avon Lash Extension one. It does give me length, but it does not make my lashes look full at all. Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> This is great, it adds amazing length and seperates the lashes for a wonderful definition that anyone would want but I would say what really throws me off in a good way. Is it smells good. It goes on wonderful and can get the little lashes under your eyes. It is long lasting and you are not feeling crusty like some mascaras do as the day wears on. I love this and like I said not that it matters that it smells good but it does so bonus!</li>
    <li> it has a &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for about 5 years now. I absolutely love it. I already have long lashes and when I put this mascara on, it makes them look amazing! People ask me all of the time if I am wearing fake lashes. I tell them no and then they say that I have gorgeous lashes. Every time I see a new mascara  come out that promises long lashes and I try it, I have never been satisfied. I always go back to this mascara. Hands down the best mascara ever!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Its the only kind ill use. Got all my friends to try it and they love it too. No clumps and stays on all day!</li>
    <li> Maybelline has been doing some great drugstore Mascara&#x27;s so I have no idea why they would release this. It&#x27;s really just terrible. It adds no volume at all and clumps and flakes like crazy. If you want a Mayelline Mascara go with their tried and true Great Lash or even the newer Rocket both are wonderful. Leave this one behind.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the name.  I have long eyelashes already and hoped to play up my features.  However, when using this product, I had to put on about 4 coats before it looked like I had even 1 coat of mascara on.  Between coats I waited a few minutes for each to dry, but it seemed to take forever.  By the time I was done, I ended up taking all of it off and going back to my old neutrogena mascara.  This product was not for me, and I personally would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this locally but I wanted to give my review... On different occasions, I&#x27;ve been asked if I&#x27;m wearing  false lashes  because my lashes are super long after using this product, I love it!!!!  I have purchased many different mascara&#x27;s from time to time just to try  but I always come back to this one.  No clumps, no flakes, it lengthens, give&#x27;s me volume, and leaves my lashes looking super gorgeous all day long~ Awesome product!!!</li>
