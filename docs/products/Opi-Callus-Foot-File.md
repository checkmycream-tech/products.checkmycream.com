      <li>This file is easy to steralize also.</li>
      <li>The grip is comfortable, easy to use.</li>
      <li>, I suppose, if you plan on wearing panty hose and need heel calluses smoother to prevent snagging the hose when putting them on, the fine side of the file will be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has two sides...medium and fine....</li>
      <li>This foot file does a great job at getting rid of dry skin and helping to keep feet smooth and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Now I can enjoy them</li>

      <li>that never come to be true, this is an exception.</li>
      <li>Good for a second quick file.</li>
      <li>and you first use the medium on your heels and then finish with the fine side.</li>
      <li>Receive it quickly, and this is a replacement item.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it many times and still feels like it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
      <li>OPI foot files are far better than the ones you can get in any Walmart or Target.  </li>
      <li>The two grits are useful</li>
      <li>Product is ok, does a decent job but too costly to use a new one on each client.</li>
      <li>Very unusual for a foot file with the paddle shape.</li>
      <li>It made a difference after the first application.</li>
      <li>This file is so much better emotionally than the metal cheese-grater type file that the salon uses for a pedicure.  </li>
      <li>Have been buying this product for years, leaves your feet smooth as no other does!</li>
      <li>Love this one and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>However, it is also less effective.  </li>
      <li>It will keep already smooth heels from becoming too rough, but it won&#x27;t turn a lizard skin baby soft.  </li>
      <li>This is the best foot sander on the planet, short of taking the ole&#x27; Black and Decker with some 20 grit and having my teenage son take his angst out on my feet.</li>
      <li>This file really works and keeps on working.  </li>
      <li>I know you hear too much of that claim</li>
      <li>The medium side, when used regularly, will maintian smooth heels.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I love the professional OPI foot file for the big jobs.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The fine side is gentle enough to use daily, even on your hands.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know how I would like this compared to more heavy foot files, but in my opinion it surpasses those.  </li>
      <li>It works either wet or dry, which is nice, and the different textured sides are clearly labeled.</li>
      <li>bought the file to prevent wearing off the fleece the backs of my boots, which I wear all winter, putting them on and taking them off frequently without socks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had no trouble since using this product.</li>
      <li>My feet feel incredibly soft after just one use.  </li>
      <li>I use this almost daily and my feet are very well maintained.</li>
      <li>Had my first one for a few years thought I should replace it.</li>

    <li> The OPI Callus File is a duel sided file with an easy to hold handle making it easy to use in the shower or out. The micro facing makes it almost impossible to tear the skin of the heel like so many foot callus files, which worsens the problem. Used with the OPI foot softening callus cream they are an excellent combination if you&#x27;re interested in keepin your feet neat and healthy. This file is easy to steralize also.</li>
    <li> I have hand and foot eczema that causes rough patches. I used tons of cream and lotions to no avail. Bought this thing to help remove dead skin and i am so pleased. It makes my feet look and feel 100% better. Thank u because I love my sandals no matter the weather&lt;br /&gt; Now I can enjoy them</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for a couple of years and absolutely love it. It has two sides...medium and fine....and you first use the medium on your heels and then finish with the fine side.

    <li> I use five years  still works. This is one for my friends</li>
    <li> Receive it quickly, and this is a replacement item. It does wonders for not only my feet but my husbands!</li>

    <li> The best one for your feet! Have been buying this product for years, leaves your feet smooth as no other does!</li>
    <li> I have been using a prescription salve for heel callus removal with only fair results. (It takes forever.) Used this file and weeks of callus removal was accomplished in a few minutes. The two grits are useful, I suppose, if you plan on wearing panty hose and need heel calluses smoother to prevent snagging the hose when putting them on, the fine side of the file will be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the file to prevent wearing off the fleece the backs of my boots, which I wear all winter, putting them on and taking them off frequently without socks.

    <li> This file is so much better emotionally than the metal cheese-grater type file that the salon uses for a pedicure.  However, it is also less effective.  It will keep already smooth heels from becoming too rough, but it won&#x27;t turn a lizard skin baby soft.  Terrific for maintaining my heels between pedicures.</li>
    <li> Love it, very easy to use and feel the results!</li>
    <li> Product is ok, does a decent job but too costly to use a new one on each client. Would recommend for personal use.</li>
    <li> No words can describe this product. It is awesome. I will use all my life</li>
    <li> I used these before and it took me forever to find them again I am so very happy !!!!</li>
    <li> It made a difference after the first application. I know you hear too much of that claim that never come to be true, this is an exception.</li>
    <li> great product love it</li>
    <li> Works great! I like this kind because even I can&#x27;t hurt myself with it. Makes my heels nice and smooth. My manicurist used the ones with the razor. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d cut my foot off. These work amazingly well. I just apply lotion afterwards. I hate rough heels.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot file for smoothing heels and the bottoms of feet.</li>
    <li> The sandpaper foot files are by far the best. If your calluses are really bad, use a callus razor first and the foot file after. You&#x27;ll get the smoothest and longest results ever. I use this almost daily and my feet are very well maintained. The grip is comfortable, easy to use. The fine side is gentle enough to use daily, even on your hands. The medium side, when used regularly, will maintian smooth heels.</li>
