### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so this is an excellent product to use.  </li>
      <li>But what I like best is how you apply it.</li>
      <li>We will continue in our search for the perfect sun tan lotion!</li>
      <li>I have to say, not at all impressed.</li>
      <li>Great price too!</li>
      <li>Having a spray-on sunscreen seemed like a great idea.</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>I thought they were exagerating when I put it on them, but then put it on my own face and it burned me also!  </li>
      <li>-It seemed to give us good even coverage</li>
      <li>This is a great product because it makes application very easy.  </li>
      <li>Easy!!</li>

      <li>So incredibly convenient and quick.</li>
      <li>Ability to spray the can at any angle was handy.</li>
      <li>I have always used a cream-type sunscreen, but sprays seemed to be getting popular and working well.  </li>
      <li>This product is easy to use and provides good protection.  </li>
      <li>So easy to use!</li>
      <li>Great product, first class sellers, arrived on time.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Got some red spots, but I attributed that to maybe the spray not being 100% perfect.    </li>
      <li>$15 on amazon is way better than $50 at a resort.  </li>
      <li>Checked in my bags for latest trip.  </li>
      <li>It is not terribly greasy, but does have a rather distinctive odor.  </li>
      <li>But, this should have done a much better job.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen was a cinch to apply, smelled better than most and didn&#x27;t let the UV&#x27;s sizzle us this summer.  </li>
      <li>The downside is that it will stain some fabrics, but you have that with most sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>While I love the convenience of the aerosol spray...</li>
      <li>After I started using this product I didn&#x27;t get any more basal cell outbreaks.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind it, but I&#x27;m sure that some people don&#x27;t want to go around smelling like flowers.   </li>
      <li>:)    </li>
      <li>Love this product .  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>which I&#x27;m sure they will not do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now how many people read this fine print?  </li>
      <li>Either way, it&#x27;s really easy.  </li>
      <li>But with this order I strongly felt the need to write one.</li>
      <li>He was fine.</li>
      <li>and you should be fine.</li>
      <li>The product however stains light colored clothes.  </li>
      <li>Get it, you will enjoy it...</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s a spray, it can also go places you don&#x27;t expect, so you&#x27;ll want to make sure you&#x27;re pointing it in the right direction.  </li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT EASY 2 USE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE SPRAY RUNS OUT QUICKLY.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy to apply, managed to make it through a week with no sunburns.</li>
      <li>beauty of a spray is that it&#x27;s clean, quick and easy.</li>
      <li>But most of all, it&#x27;s fast!</li>
      <li>We were so excited to have found this sun tan lotion</li>
      <li>It provides better coverage than the spritz type sprays, and makes it easier to apply to one&#x27;s own back.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty nice, is very convenient to put on, and the spf is just enought so that you get protection but can still work on your tan.</li>
      <li>but that could be because I make sure I really get  myself coated with this stuff).</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>Also effective- no sunburns so far.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Okay, I&#x27;m ready now!\\</li>
      <li>-It ran out incredibly quickly.</li>
      <li>Applying sunscreen with a spray is super convenient.     </li>
      <li>Overall, one of the best sunscreens I&#x27;ve used and definitely the easiest.</li>
      <li>I would have given more stars if it smelled better and if my skin didn&#x27;t feel so filmy and leathery after applying it (even hours later-</li>
      <li>I suggested they list it in bold print along with \\&quot; Water Resistant, Non-Greasy\\&quot;</li>
      <li>As a cyclist, I like these because they are quick to apply.</li>
      <li>I used Coppertone Sport on the family today in very hot weather.</li>
      <li>It sprays on in a fine mist, and dries almost immediately to a film that&#x27;s pretty much unnoticeable.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>One bottle was not enough for 4 days at the beach, for two people who mostly stay in the shade.</li>
      <li>You must be aware that this sunscreen WILL STAIN your swimsuit, coverup, or any clothes that you wear with the sunscreen on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Do not apply this sunscreen while wearing light colored clothing or bathing suit and make sure to let the product dry completely before putting clothes on.</li>
      <li>POSITIVES:  -Easy to apply (especially on the beach, no sand stuck to your body!)  </li>
      <li>Reality is not so simple, in practice what happens is that a lot it ends up sprayed into the air and floor around you, not on your skin, it&#x27;s easy to miss spots since you can&#x27;t see which areas you covered</li>
      <li>I just purchased a large packet of this Coppertone sunscreen from Costco.  </li>
      <li>not so much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve learned with the sprays you really need to watch your application in the wind.</li>
      <li>I thought the spray would be convenient but it went everywhere, we went through almost a whole bottle and we still got burned.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get burned as I reapply it every 2 hours as needed and really apply this liberally.</li>
      <li>(I ended up with two red knees after the first day at the beach), and it runs out really quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep this around for short-term use, but I&#x27;m going back to the lotions for spending any significant time out in the sun.</li>
      <li>Other than that, another elegant find in skin products.</li>
      <li>and I was dripping with sweat more so than if I had used a conventional cream.  </li>
      <li>The real test case was my husband, who normally burns within five minutes.</li>
      <li>I will be searching for a new brand of protection and it will NOT be Coppertone!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this before for short amounts of time outside, and it&#x27;s done ok.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was highly rated in a consumer magazine.  </li>
      <li>I wound up getting two of these and four of another highly rated sunscreen,</li>
      <li>I now have over $200 worth of white clothes that are turned orange in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t notice sunscreens when I wear them, but I did notice this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s super light, so you don&#x27;t have the icky coating that the lotions have.</li>
      <li>as years ago I used the lotion kind and ended up with giant flaky dry patches on my face, instead I use a different brand for my face and neck.</li>
      <li>Also, a can doesn&#x27;t go very far.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick, not messy, and helps tattoos to keep from fading in the long run.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I really like this product!</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m rushing out the door (I&#x27;m always rushing out the door), then I&#x27;m apt to skip the sunblock because it&#x27;s messy, takes time to rub in, then I have to wash and dry</li>
      <li>I am thoroughly red, sore-to-the-touch burned in some areas, and pretty much the only places that were protected either naturally</li>
      <li>When I go out, my face and hands are about the only things exposed to the sun, and using a spray directly on my face didn&#x27;t seem smart.  </li>
      <li>Neither of us have really sensitive skin either.  </li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t advise using it inside or near any soft furnishings (bed, sofa etc)  </li>
      <li>Pump action sprays can&#x27;t manage that.</li>
      <li>I like this because it&#x27;s not messy and goopy like cream.  </li>
      <li>until after two cotton tops were completely destroyed with yellowish streaks from this product.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re penny pinching, the same price in suntan lotion might last you longer, but the convenience was well worth it for me.</li>
      <li>Quick, less mess, clean hands.</li>
      <li>It left yellow marks on my kid&#x27;s white shirts and my light blue shirt.  </li>
      <li>I made the mistake years ago of not really getting coated because the wind blew it away first and then got burned.</li>
      <li>In fact, it&#x27;s so easy that I was skeptical it was working at first.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I took this to burning man (in the middle of the Nevada desert). Used ever day (once or twice per day) by about 3 people, the two pack lasted 5 days. Quick and easy to apply, managed to make it through a week with no sunburns. Several people used it on their face (even though the instructions say not to), and aside from a bad taste in their mouth, they had no issues (didn&#x27;t run into eyes).    Ability to spray the can at any angle was handy. Also, I chased a water truck and got doused, and the sunscreen kept working  If you&#x27;re penny pinching, the same price in suntan lotion might last you longer, but the convenience was well worth it for me.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunscreen. So incredibly convenient and quick. I&#x27;ve always spent forever trying to slather on the cream versions...it&#x27;s messy and exhausting. Just a few sprays with this product and you&#x27;re ready to go. Plus it&#x27;s super light, so you don&#x27;t have the icky coating that the lotions have. As for the negative reviews, it actually takes a minute or two to fully dry...and it&#x27;s pretty shiny while wet, so I&#x27;m not really sure how people can say that they missed spots?  Similarly, simply refrain from spraying this stuff on the floor or on your clothes and you should be fine. ;)</li>
    <li> While I love the convenience of the aerosol spray...this sunblock burns my childrens faces!  I thought they were exagerating when I put it on them, but then put it on my own face and it burned me also!  Neither of us have really sensitive skin either.  My husband said it didn&#x27;t burn his face...so who knows, may be just us???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual product effectiveness...yes it works!  It is not terribly greasy, but does have a rather distinctive odor.  Also, a can doesn&#x27;t go very far.  Lathering up a family of 4 twice and the can is pretty much empty, but this isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem just with Coppertone&#x27;s aerosol sunblock...it&#x27;s all brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before for short amounts of time outside, and it&#x27;s done ok. Got some red spots, but I attributed that to maybe the spray not being 100% perfect.    Brought a can of it with me to the beach today, liberally reapplying it throughout the day. I have to say, not at all impressed. I am thoroughly red, sore-to-the-touch burned in some areas, and pretty much the only places that were protected either naturally didn&#x27;t get sun and my shoulder blades.    Now, I will say that I probably got less burned with this than I would have without it, given that I was outside in the sun for the bulk of the day. But, this should have done a much better job. I&#x27;ll keep this around for short-term use, but I&#x27;m going back to the lotions for spending any significant time out in the sun. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> This product stained our clothes! From research, I have learned that the Avobenzone in the spray reacts with the minerals in the water and can stain the clothes yellow or orange. Whites seem impossible to get white again. I am frustrated because it ruined some nice clothes. Some sites have recommended using \\&quot;The Works Bathroom Cleaner\\&quot; and \\&quot;Barkeepers Friend\\&quot;. Hopefully it will work. This never happened with other sprays we have used in the past. We will never use this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and provides good protection.  The product however stains light colored clothes.  It left yellow marks on my kid&#x27;s white shirts and my light blue shirt.  Do not apply this sunscreen while wearing light colored clothing or bathing suit and make sure to let the product dry completely before putting clothes on.</li>
    <li> Worst sunburn ever. False sense of security. Sprayed repeatedly, ended up with splotchy burn blistering off the next day. Lot of waste (spray goes everywhere). What is sprayed to skin may or may not be useful - I was fully covered - but burned completely random and splotchy/spotty. Ought to be advertised as basting juice. Sunscreen? not so much. SPF nothing or negative 30 maybe.</li>
    <li> Checked in my bags for latest trip.  $15 on amazon is way better than $50 at a resort.  Plan ahead and save some cash.  Works great only complaint is it does not last long.</li>
    <li> After I started using this product I didn&#x27;t get any more basal cell outbreaks. [[ASIN:1604430001 QuickFacts Basal &amp; Squamous Cell Skin Cancer]] by the American Cancer Society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty of a spray is that it&#x27;s clean, quick and easy. The problem with a spray is that it gets in the eyes. Avoid sudden breezes when using outdoors. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for kids. [[ASIN:1572244194 Sun Protection For Life: Your Guide To A Lifetime Of Healthy &amp; Beautiful Skin]] by Mary Mills Barrow.</li>
    <li> I used Coppertone Sport on the family today in very hot weather. We were sweating quite a bit, but the sunscreen did not need to be reapplied. The real test case was my husband, who normally burns within five minutes. He was fine. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the sticky sensation I had all day. I normally don&#x27;t notice sunscreens when I wear them, but I did notice this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I like the continuous spray feature. It provides better coverage than the spritz type sprays, and makes it easier to apply to one&#x27;s own back. It also sprays upside down without problems. Pump action sprays can&#x27;t manage that.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible, It applies ok, it will protect you from the sun, but for me it ruined 3 shirts leaving a yellow stain, its very sticky and nasty after it&#x27;s applied. I was stuck and had to get something, I should of looked harder and got banana boat.</li>
    <li> As a cyclist, I like these because they are quick to apply. But, if you shaved your legs the day before, when you put it on it stings.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was highly rated in a consumer magazine.  I wound up getting two of these and four of another highly rated sunscreen, Up and Up, sold by Target.  Apparently my order was duplicated, so I now have six cans of a product I don&#x27;t like.  Oh, well.    I have always used a cream-type sunscreen, but sprays seemed to be getting popular and working well.  When I go out, my face and hands are about the only things exposed to the sun, and using a spray directly on my face didn&#x27;t seem smart.  I sprayed it onto my hands and then applied it to my face.    I don&#x27;t like the smell.  It reminds me of an insecticide or insect repellant.  After a few seconds, my face began to sting slightly, like after applying an aftershave. My face is the only area it irritated, so maybe it&#x27;s just me. I already spent my summer&#x27;s budget for sunscreen, so I guess I&#x27;ll use it up.    You might like the smell, and it might not sting your face.  If I were the type to lie on the beach all day, I guess spraying it all over me would be easier than applying a cream, so that&#x27;s a consideration.</li>
    <li> I use this to spray over my tattoo because tattoos can fade overtime in the sun without sunscreen...so this is an excellent product to use.  It&#x27;s quick, not messy, and helps tattoos to keep from fading in the long run.  I recommend this for everyone with tattoos.</li>
    <li> Learn from my mistake, do not use this product.  Unfortunately, I did not see the fine print at the bottom of the Coppertone label, \\&quot;may stain some fabrics,\\&quot; until after two cotton tops were completely destroyed with yellowish streaks from this product.  This product didn&#x27;t destroy a precious little antique lace item, it destroyed a cotton polo and a cotton chambray shirt.      Coppertone released a product which is GUARANTEED to ruin its customers&#x27; clothing.  They should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M A MAILMAN SO I SPEND 6 HOURS A DAY WALKING IN THE SUN AND HAVE NEVER GOTTEN A SUNBURN WHILE WEARING IT. GREAT PRODUCT EASY 2 USE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE SPRAY RUNS OUT QUICKLY. 7.5 FL OZ 3-PK AT BJS IS $16.99 6OZ 2PK ON AMAZON IS $15.</li>
    <li> Love this product .  It smells pretty nice, is very convenient to put on, and the spf is just enought so that you get protection but can still work on your tan.</li>
    <li> This product works, and is so convenient to use that it finally, FINALLY got me into the habit of wearing sunscreen. This is the first summer that I haven&#x27;t spent in a state of pink itchiness, and if Coppertone keeps making this, it may be my last!  As a sunscreen, it works great--I haven&#x27;t been burned yet. But what I like best is how you apply it. It sprays on in a fine mist, and dries almost immediately to a film that&#x27;s pretty much unnoticeable. It&#x27;s waterproof, doesn&#x27;t feel strange or greasy, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. But most of all, it&#x27;s fast! You can be about to go out the door, grab the can and go *spray* *spray* *Spraaay!* \\&quot;Okay, I&#x27;m ready now!\\&quot;  I have only one minor complaint--I wish it were unscented. I don&#x27;t mind it, but I&#x27;m sure that some people don&#x27;t want to go around smelling like flowers.   Overall, I really like this product! If you usually can&#x27;t be bothered to wear sunscreen, try it out.</li>
    <li> So easy to use! No more rubbing white creamy sunscreen...Also effective- no sunburns so far. I love it. I&#x27;m just not sure you can take it on the plane since it&#x27;s a pressurized container. Other than that, another elegant find in skin products.Get it, you will enjoy it...</li>
    <li> We were so excited to have found this sun tan lotion however it did nothing but disappoint.  POSITIVES:  -Easy to apply (especially on the beach, no sand stuck to your body!)  -It seemed to give us good even coverage and we didn&#x27;t burn.  NEGATIVES:  -It didn&#x27;t stay dry, 10 minutes in the sun in Spain and I was dripping with sweat more so than if I had used a conventional cream.  -Spray went everywhere, wouldn&#x27;t advise using it inside or near any soft furnishings (bed, sofa etc)  -It ran out incredibly quickly. For 2 people, we were getting through one can in a day and a half.  -Stained clothes beyond repair - even after washing and vanishing  -Worst of all, it left a horrible white sticky residue on our skin, even after showering (and we were using body scrub and shower gel). It was as if our skin was peeling, but it was the remnants of the spray - not our skin. This meant that any clothes we put on in the evening felt like they were sticking to our bodies.    We will continue in our search for the perfect sun tan lotion!</li>
    <li> Applying sunscreen with a spray is super convenient.     However, you can quickly empty the bottle if you apply from head to toe.     Recommend that you apply a sunscreen LOTION instead and only use the spray for reapplication when spending a long day in the sun.</li>
    <li> Having a spray-on sunscreen seemed like a great idea. Quick, less mess, clean hands. Reality is not so simple, in practice what happens is that a lot it ends up sprayed into the air and floor around you, not on your skin, it&#x27;s easy to miss spots since you can&#x27;t see which areas you covered (I ended up with two red knees after the first day at the beach), and it runs out really quickly. One bottle was not enough for 4 days at the beach, for two people who mostly stay in the shade. I&#x27;ll use the 2nd bottle, but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I drive a convertible car and am concerned about the health of my skin, so I use sunscreen often.  This is a great product because it makes application very easy.  Spray it on your hands and run it in or spray it wherever you need sun protection.  Either way, it&#x27;s really easy.  In fact, it&#x27;s so easy that I was skeptical it was working at first.  But I&#x27;ve used it for a season or so without any problems.    The downside is that it will stain some fabrics, but you have that with most sunscreens.  Since it&#x27;s a spray, it can also go places you don&#x27;t expect, so you&#x27;ll want to make sure you&#x27;re pointing it in the right direction.  I know this sounds obvious, but I&#x27;ve been in a hurry a few times and made a bit of a mess. :)    Overall, one of the best sunscreens I&#x27;ve used and definitely the easiest.</li>
    <li> Recommend doing a small test spot on your skin first.  Used a small amount on my neck and shoulders (only the neck was exposed) and felt a burning in sunlight.  Next day &#x27;weeping blisters&#x27; appeared on on the shoulders that went on for 3 days and then it spread in the form of hives.  10 days later blisters are still forming.  About 30% of my skin is rashed and cost me a doctor&#x27;s visit.  Finally found something that I am allergic to and it is a doozy.  Been using sunblock, tanning lotions for years and never had a reaction like this one.</li>
    <li> Not happy with my order at all! I received the sun screen in the mail which expires in 2 months. Not only that but your the seller tried to scratch out the expiration date with something sharp. Not to mention it looks horribly tacky. These were going to Go in our goodie bags for our guest at our destination wedding in November. We are now not putting these in there due to the tackiness of the cans now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally do not write reviews. But with this order I strongly felt the need to write one. Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was a cinch to apply, smelled better than most and didn&#x27;t let the UV&#x27;s sizzle us this summer.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> I like this because it&#x27;s not messy and goopy like cream.  If I&#x27;m rushing out the door (I&#x27;m always rushing out the door), then I&#x27;m apt to skip the sunblock because it&#x27;s messy, takes time to rub in, then I have to wash and dry my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with this spray, I close my eyes, spray it on my face, neck &amp; arms and I&#x27;m done!  Easy!!</li>
    <li> Used the Coppertone Sport Continuous Spray 30 SPF out on the boat this weekend.  I applied and reapplied several times on my child, my husband and myself.  I thought the spray would be convenient but it went everywhere, we went through almost a whole bottle and we still got burned.  I&#x27;m extremely careful when it comes to my son being in the sun and applied/reapplied it very often and liberally, especially to his back and face.  His back got very pink and his face got slightly burned also.  I am extremely disappointed in how it worked and will NEVER use it again.  I will be searching for a new brand of protection and it will NOT be Coppertone!</li>
    <li> Turns out there is an ingredient in it that will stain clothes after they have been washed (the ingredient reacts with iron in your water) Ruined our clothes!! Not to mention the coverage was horrible I was burnt in stripes even after I thought I had covered everywhere. Also, this is so expensive!! The spray barely covers enough for two adult bodies one time!</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen on almost a daily basis. I don&#x27;t get burned as I reapply it every 2 hours as needed and really apply this liberally. I&#x27;ve learned with the sprays you really need to watch your application in the wind. I made the mistake years ago of not really getting coated because the wind blew it away first and then got burned. I would have given more stars if it smelled better and if my skin didn&#x27;t feel so filmy and leathery after applying it (even hours later- but that could be because I make sure I really get  myself coated with this stuff). Overall it&#x27;s a good product. I&#x27;ll continue to use it as it gets the job done. I don&#x27;t use this on my face though as years ago I used the lotion kind and ended up with giant flaky dry patches on my face, instead I use a different brand for my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Great product, first class sellers, arrived on time.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I just purchased a large packet of this Coppertone sunscreen from Costco.  Our family used it on our recent trip to the Caribbean.  You must be aware that this sunscreen WILL STAIN your swimsuit, coverup, or any clothes that you wear with the sunscreen on your skin.  My family was so disappointed to have swimsuits, coverups, jackets, jerseys all turn orange.  I tried soaking in bleach and I still couldn&#x27;t get out the stains.  I now have over $200 worth of white clothes that are turned orange in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I phoned Coppertone and they told me that in small print under the directions in the section called \\&quot;Other Information\\&quot; it states \\&quot;may stain or damage some fabrics or surfaces\\&quot;.  Now how many people read this fine print?  I suggested they list it in bold print along with \\&quot; Water Resistant, Non-Greasy\\&quot; etc. which I&#x27;m sure they will not do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER buy another Coppertone product.</li>
