      <li>I bought it right away and have used it a couple of times.</li>
      <li>It works very well in keeping my hair pretty smooth.</li>
      <li>I previously bought a kit with this oil and the leave-in treatment at Marshall&#x27;s and loved it immediately.  </li>

      <li>I tried this for the first time at the kittyhawkhair salon.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair silky, shiny, soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have used the oil before, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Very earthy, not perfumy.</li>

      <li>The oil has zero weight and you only need to use the size of a tear drop so it should literally last many years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found the shampoo and conditioner to leave my hair very soft and manageable, but what I really like is the oil.</li>
      <li>She always loves to try new products and let me take some samples home.</li>
      <li>I bought these hair products trough the internet just because its way too expensive in my country (DR), i truly recommended, it leaves your hair luminous, soft and it smells great.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair so smooth that a flat iron is not necessary and believe me with my hair</li>
      <li>I bought a small sample size at the salon, then bought all three products on Amazon at a better price....</li>
      <li>Would definitely reccomend but only if you like spicy scents such as amber because the scent is strong.</li>
      <li>And they mAke my hair look soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Also I love the delicate smell of moringa.</li>
      <li>Great for long, thick, course, grey hair!  </li>
      <li>She thought that because the oil would last such a long time that it would easily cost $75.  </li>
      <li>so I barely use a drop for shine.</li>
      <li>Too expensive for what it is, it does not  even smell nice</li>
      <li>so I could comb my hair after showering, but now I use a little of the oil on the bottom half of my hair and it works better than any leave-</li>

<li> So much less than retail.</li>
<li> &quot;, well that is so not true.</li>
<li> I have very long hair which is rather thick.</li>
<li> It is heavily scented of amber (?)</li>
<li> im missing the oil, so my order is imcompleted, and i wont pay adittional shipping cost for your mistakes.</li>
<li> I also spread a few drops on the palms of my hands and run it through my hair before gong to bed.</li>
<li> However, I find the oil is really heavy</li>
<li> , I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t seem to be sold in stores so are hard to find.</li>
<li> Often I have a hard time finding conditioners that will soften my hair, but this stuff does the trick.</li>
<li> The shampoo and conditioner are thick and creamy.</li>
<li> and I had  to pay 16 pounds of import duties, not happy</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t had a bad day since I&#x27;ve been using them.</li>

    <li> Great for long, thick, course, grey hair!  I previously bought a kit with this oil and the leave-in treatment at Marshall&#x27;s and loved it immediately.  It keeps my hair smooth and calm and smells wonderful; the leave-in treatment was okay.  The shampoo and conditioner are also awesome.  I will continue to use this regimen for as long as these products are available.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product makes my hair look and feel. I have problems with frizz and unruly gray and colored hair. The way it smells is an added bonus!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser had been given a sample of these products and used them on my hair on my last visit.  She thought that because the oil would last such a long time that it would easily cost $75.  I was shocked when I came home and did a search and found the trio available on Amazon for ~$44.99 and ordered it straight away.  It leaves your hair so smooth that a flat iron is not necessary and believe me with my hair it&#x27;s always been necessary.  The amber scent is wonderful as well and is carried from one product to the next so there&#x27;s no mixing of scents. The oil has zero weight and you only need to use the size of a tear drop so it should literally last many years.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time at the kittyhawkhair salon. It made my hair really soft and it smelled awesome ! I bought it right away and have used it a couple of times. The shampoo , conditioner and a leave on conditioner/oil have the same aroma and makes your hair manageable.</li>
    <li> I really love how this product smells and feels on my hair.  Leaves my hair smooth and soft. I mostly bought it for the scent.  Very earthy, not perfumy.</li>
    <li> Love these products.  The merchant was efficient and the shampoo and conditioner are amazing!  Haven&#x27;t had a bad day since I&#x27;ve been using them.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, conditioner and oil.  It smells wonderful, and it works very well on my hair.  I use the oil as an aromatherapy oil rather than on my hair.  It smells divine!</li>
    <li> I bought these hair products trough the internet just because its way too expensive in my country (DR), i truly recommended, it leaves your hair luminous, soft and it smells great. The only thing was that it came open.</li>
    <li> &#x27;My order was for 3 items the shampoo, conditioner &amp; india oil for 50 us dollar as the invoice says, but im missing the oil, so my order is imcompleted, and i wont pay adittional shipping cost for your mistakes.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for what it is, it does not  even smell nice and I had  to pay 16 pounds of import duties, not happy</li>
    <li> This products are amazing they smell soo good and makes your hair very shinny and looking fabulous. It doesnt weigh down and the drops lasted more than a year</li>
    <li> shampoo does not lather at all - I know this is the new thing with shampoo, but my hair does not feel good or clean with the shampoo.  Also, the fragrance was not strong enough - the salon&#x27;s smelled a lot stronger each time they used it on me.  Is this an inferior version of what the salon carries?  I will however continue to use the conditioner.  It feels great.</li>
    <li> I love this product it smells amazing! Going to buy it for some of my friends as Christmas gifts I want to share this!</li>
    <li> Love this set. I had tried these products from a sample box and really loved the smell. They don&#x27;t seem to be sold in stores so are hard to find. The price here from this seller is great. So much less than retail. I love that these hAve a wonderful spicy scent, it&#x27;s like aromatherapy. And they mAke my hair look soft and shiny. Would definitely reccomend but only if you like spicy scents such as amber because the scent is strong.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my hair is very fine and frizzes up in humid weather. It works very well in keeping my hair pretty smooth. However, I find the oil is really heavy so I barely use a drop for shine. I&#x27;d rather use a cream. The bottle of oil will probably last me a lifetime!</li>
    <li> This are my favorite from all the ICON products!! Wouldn&#x27;t trade them for anything, my hair smells great after the shower and it feels soft and easy to blow dry</li>
    <li> This product was introduced to me through my hairdresser. She always loves to try new products and let me take some samples home. I was hooked. My hair is soft, conditioned and smells amazing. I get compliments all the time. The oil is especially wonderful. Just a drop and my hair is perfect. So glad I was able to find this product for a reasonable price online.</li>
    <li> love these. Especially love the hair oil.</li>
    <li> I have used the oil before, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased the shampoo and conditioner. I love this stuff. My hair feels healthy and soft and smells fabulous.</li>
    <li> I work at a salon which sells a variety of hair care brands. I had tried Moroccan oil products with no luck. The India care products leave my hair feeling a lot more manageable. I bought a set of the shampoo, conditioner, oil, and healing spray, which I can&#x27;t find on Amazon, but hopefully soon. I have very long hair which is rather thick. Often I have a hard time finding conditioners that will soften my hair, but this stuff does the trick. It has kind of a musky amber/sandalwood smell.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is very up lifting. The combo is soothing. I strongly recommend this set of hair care for those who are in search.</li>
    <li> I started using ICON color and care products about nine months ago. I have dry and frizzy hair that is often associated with coloring. I&#x27;ve found the shampoo and conditioner to leave my hair very soft and manageable, but what I really like is the oil. When the stylist suggested using oil to combat frizz, I thought \\&quot;ugg..limp AND greasy\\&quot;, well that is so not true. The oil is the very best product I have ever used! It leaves my hair silky, shiny, soft and smooth. I use it on my damp hair before blow drying. It retains body and styling and keeps the frizz at bay. I also spread a few drops on the palms of my hands and run it through my hair before gong to bed. I bought a small sample size at the salon, then bought all three products on Amazon at a better price....Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit* I think I should mention the fragrance, which in my opinion is the only negative aspect of the product. It is heavily scented of amber (?), I&#x27;m not sure. I don&#x27;t really care for the smell, so if you are into those musky sort of scents you will really love this, if not you will be happy to know that it does wear off.</li>
    <li> I always buy good quality shampoo and conditioner but this stuff is the best! I have wavy hair which I either let dry naturally or blow dry straight and since the strands of my hair are thin, they tend to tangle a lot. The shampoo and conditioner are thick and creamy. Before I found these products, I would have to use a leave-in conditioner so I could comb my hair after showering, but now I use a little of the oil on the bottom half of my hair and it works better than any leave-in I&#x27;ve used. Also, the smell is heavenly and it stays in your hair all day long, especially if you use a little of the oil. I find my self sniffing my lovely smelling hair throughout the day! I am so glad to have found them here on amazon because my hair salon sells them for much more money.</li>
    <li> Leales huir very smooth, radiant looking, not heavy at all. Better than Moroccan oil products. Would recommend 100% to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using Icon products since 2 years: my hair is stonger and longer. Perfect for dry and curly or wavy hair. Also I love the delicate smell of moringa.</li>
