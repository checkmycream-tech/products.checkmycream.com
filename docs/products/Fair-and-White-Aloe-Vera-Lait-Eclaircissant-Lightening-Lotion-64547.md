    <li> This really works! I am a light honey skin tone and bought this to help with some darker discoloration and unevenness.

    <li> I bought this lotion a month ago and it works wonders. I had some scarring on my legs as well as discoloration. I also suffer from hyper pigmentation on my face and I was looking for something that would even me out. I use this lotion in combination with Fair &amp; White Savon Aha-2 Exfoliating and Lightening Soap, together these products work wonders. After a week of use my dark spots and scarring started to fade. My face has evened out so well and my scars on my legs has lightened tremendously. All in all my body is more even toned thanks to these two products. It doesn&#x27;t make you lighter so if your looking for something to lighten your skin tone, this isn&#x27;t the product.</li>
    <li> The aloe vera lait eclaircissant is very good, it lets my skin soft. It doesn&#x27;t changemy color but my color is shinning now.</li>
    <li> Caused me rashes. It&#x27;s in the garbagge</li>
    <li> This product is not good at all, it doesn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t suggest anyone to buy this product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> This produt works really well after showering. My only problem is that my lower extremities remains dry after use. Works well on my upper body.</li>

    <li> The lotion is really good and works well, it nourishes the skin and I started noticing some changes on my skin after a week, but I had to mixed it with other lightening cream &amp; oil to work faster. But it worth the money. It&#x27;s original and at a good reasonable price.</li>

    <li> Arrived in good condition</li>
    <li> I was always wondering if I would ever get a lotion that can eradicate my uneven skin due to skin rushes I had couple of years ago. I tried a whole varieties of lotion that have hydroquinone in them but all to no avail. Did some more google search and encountered this amazing lotion. Placed my first order and after using for first three months, I realized a big improvement on my skin so went ahead and ordered the second and I keep appreciating the results. This has become a remedy to my troubled skin and am loving it. It worths all it&#x27;s priced for. Give it a big try.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what it says for me.never purchase again</li>
    <li> I am sure this product would have worked well if it was not defective. I will reorder and try it.</li>
