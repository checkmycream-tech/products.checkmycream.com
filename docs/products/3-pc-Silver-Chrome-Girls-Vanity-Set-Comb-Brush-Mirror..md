      <li>She really likes it and it looks very nice.  </li>

      <li>I am a young 20 something and bought this for myself as I have always loved the classic and vintage pictures you see of women sitting at gorgeous vanities.</li>
      <li>I have really enjoyed them and feel they were well worth the price.</li>
      <li>so it took me a while to get used to using the comb to deranged my hair and them the brush to smooth and soften the hair.</li>
      <li>Overall, this purchase was great</li>
      <li>you want something that looks pretty and doesn&#x27;t work -- you need to glue the comb better.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a good glue mirror was loose had to glue mirror and brush to the handle</li>
      <li>I have been looking for something really elegant to give to my 3 year old grand daughter for Christmas and this truly fits the bill.</li>
      <li>Thank you because the person that we gifted it to enjoyed it and was surprised when I gave it to her.</li>
      <li>It was actually much nicer and a far better quality than we expected for the price, and our grand daugher loved it!</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and was packaged well</li>
      <li>It was packaged well and came quickly.</li>
      <li>and they were very pretty</li>
      <li>This is a very pretty set I purchased for my daughter.  </li>
      <li>It seems well constructed and very pretty</li>
      <li>Very pretty and shiny.</li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t fret, they&#x27;re pretty rich and she&#x27;s got all kinds of stuff anyway.</li>
      <li>This is nice to look at when it comes...but shortly falls apart....</li>
      <li>Brush is not usable on hair, except maybe on a baby&#x27;s hair, and even then I wouldn&#x27;t because i have nice boar bristle wooden brushes for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>most reviews talk about giving these to young children.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super shiny and the detailing is pretty.  </li>
      <li>And she loves it very much.</li>
      <li>Very shiny and bright, and while made in china, does NOT have the stamped curvy bits overlapping each other.</li>
      <li>Not the least bit happy.</li>
      <li>i like everything about this set except the first day i got my set</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone interested in this item.</li>
      <li>and it actually looks better in real life then in the picture.</li>
      <li>This set has a very nice finish and it&#x27;s nice and heavy, feels like vintage style sets - not cheaply made!</li>
      <li>This set replaced the old set and was exactly the same set that I had purchased many years ago.</li>
      <li>I really like the product.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much for the product.</li>
      <li>would give this one star, but the mirror was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very well made and arrives well packaged.</li>
      <li>ornate metal is very new looking,</li>
      <li>Ok, there is a reason the brush is shown bristles down in the picture.</li>
      <li>Saw some of the reviews that said the mirror was loose, but ours was just fine.</li>
      <li>I know she will just love it, she is so grown up for a little 3 year old and loves playing dress up</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great gift at the price, I wasnt about to spend $60 or more for something that can be fixed with a little glue.</li>
      <li>The comb is much bigger than I expected, but everything is lovely.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This set has a very nice finish and it&#x27;s nice and heavy, feels like vintage style sets - not cheaply made!</li>
    <li> Our young granddaughters (6 and 7 yrs. old) said the brush was too soft to go through their hair.  i was disappointed with both purchases.</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a gift and I got it rushed delivered to us and it came in the next day and it actually looks better in real life then in the picture. Thank you because the person that we gifted it to enjoyed it and was surprised when I gave it to her. It&#x27;s heavier then your regular brush and comb but we preferred it like that.</li>
    <li> The comb came apart after having it a week but it is fine.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter for her vanity. Very well made and arrives well packaged. She loved them.</li>
    <li> This is nice to look at when it comes...but shortly falls apart....each piece disassembled in some way....not what I wanted or expected. I know it is not the most expensive item of this type...quite the contrary...BUT I expected the three pieces to stay assembled in less than a month...and...not because it was dropped or misused! The glue seems to be either old...or the wrong type.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my Grand daughters Kacie and Raegan. They were delighted with the gift. Although they both recieved many gifts, Kacie, in paticular immediately started brushing her hair. It is really a nice gift.</li>
    <li> I have now bought 2 sets of these, one for my house and one for my granddaughter to put on her vanity I bought her.  She loves them. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Our five-year-old grand daughter has looked longingly at my wife&#x27;s silver set and we thought this would be a great birthday present for her.  It was actually much nicer and a far better quality than we expected for the price, and our grand daugher loved it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them, the brush is soft and the comb does not pull her hair. seems to be made well, but we will see.</li>
    <li> This set is very attractive, as well as just the right size for young girls to hold and use. The bristles, while stiffer than I thought they would be, were still softer than brushes with those plastic bristles, which can be hard on young scalps.</li>
    <li> I purchased two Silver Chrome Vanity Sets for my grandchildren as a remembrance from their Grandmother (Me).  When the packages arrived, my purchases were beyond expectations! I can also thank your staff for sending me the items undamaged.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty set I purchased for my daughter.  She&#x27;ll love it.  It is good quality and really brings to mind the old-fashioned vanity sets you see in the movies.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my wife. And she loves it very much. Its shape and silver cotinged color is fantafabulous.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set for my daughter&#x27;s vanity. My daughter liked it a lot! I would recommend this item</li>
    <li> i like everything about this set except the first day i got my set the silver piece on my comb wasn&#x27;t attach to the comb like it suppose to be</li>
    <li> The brush and mirror are beautiful, but I never received the comb. If I would have received the full set, I would have rated it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Every Little girl should have a dresser set, these were perfect for my granddaughters they loved them, I hope they will keep them and pass them down to their little girls.</li>
    <li> The set above looks dark and gothic what i got was a bright cheap looking plastic bright sliver set that looks like its for a very young child&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Good quality, good size comb. I had it engraved for a Christmas gift, engraved well.my daughter loved it.  She&#x27;ll treasure it as a fine keepsake.</li>
    <li> These seem well made and sturdy.  Bought them for Christmas for one of my daughters and I just know the other two girls are going to be sneaking them to their room!  The comb is much bigger than I expected, but everything is lovely.</li>
    <li> Ok, there is a reason the brush is shown bristles down in the picture. It can&#x27;t be used for hair! they are white bristles of the style and consistency of a nail brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this one star, but the mirror was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ornate metal is very new looking, no black undertones like in the picture. Very shiny and bright, and while made in china, does NOT have the stamped curvy bits overlapping each other. For this reason, the mirror is very nice, as it&#x27;s 100% metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Comb is usable. It is a high-quality (to me) piece of plastic glued (badly) into the metal handle. You can see the glue. But the plastic is good and strong and a nice color and the comb works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They couldn&#x27;t have use boar bristles or at least a higher quality plastic that looks like boar bristles in the brush???? Or at least just sell the mirror with the comb and leave the brush out of it? Brush is not usable on hair, except maybe on a baby&#x27;s hair, and even then I wouldn&#x27;t because i have nice boar bristle wooden brushes for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that looks pretty and doesn&#x27;t work -- you need to glue the comb better. If you want a made in china knock off that at least you can play with -- you need to fix the brush.</li>
    <li> When I received this order only the brush was in there. No mirror or comb. Not the least bit happy.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something really elegant to give to my 3 year old grand daughter for Christmas and this truly fits the bill. It is elegant and will look beautiful up on her dresser. I know she will just love it, she is so grown up for a little 3 year old and loves playing dress up, this is the perfect gift for her! It is very good quality. It was wrapped and protected well during shipping. I am very pleased and will recommend this gift to others. My neighbor is already considering this for her grand daughter!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous set and looks great on my vanity!</li>
    <li> Got this for my nice and she loved it..very good quality...i was impressed of how nice it was. all in all very happy and pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this set! Christmas present from the husband.  Beautiful, good weight, looks lovely on my dressing tray. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my grand daughters 6th birthday to go with a vanity I was given her.  It was the perfect set! She felt like a princess when she opened it and couldn&#x27;t wait to brush her hair with it. It is a nice set for the money and for her to have at this age. Saw some of the reviews that said the mirror was loose, but ours was just fine. I had been looking for several months for either a hand painted set or one like this and was unable to find in local stores and boutiques. I finally found it on Amazon, and was worried about being too late to  get it in.  I hated to pay the priority shipping, but I did receive it in time for her party and needless to say we were both thrilled!</li>
    <li> I had one like this and it was old and falling apart as I had it for a long time. I bought this as a replacement for the old one. Very pretty and shiny. Packaged nicely  and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> This made a 10year olds birthday! Excellent service and delivery and an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the set! I have seen many sets like this in antique stores that go for $150+, but this was a steal! And it looks just like those sets in the stores! Overall, this purchase was great and I suggest it to anyone.</li>
    <li> We were all thrilled with this brush, comb, and mirror set. It was a gift for one of our grandchildren, but we loved it so much she never got it. But don&#x27;t fret, they&#x27;re pretty rich and she&#x27;s got all kinds of stuff anyway. Yay!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom and she loves it. It looks great. Thank you so much for the product.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time.  My young daughter saw a set like this in a movie and wanted a set just like it.  Saw it at amazon and they were very pretty and she just loves it!</li>
    <li> very nice set, heavy, seems to be good quality</li>
    <li> My nine-year-old granddaughter loves this set.  It looks like something that came from Sleeping Beauty&#x27;s castle.  They appear sturdy, the mirror is clear.  She&#x27;s spent hours brushing her hair with this set.</li>
    <li> Make sure you have a good glue mirror was loose had to glue mirror and brush to the handle&lt;br /&gt;Items are beautiful but needed some fixing.</li>
    <li> most reviews talk about giving these to young children. I am a young 20 something and bought this for myself as I have always loved the classic and vintage pictures you see of women sitting at gorgeous vanities. I have really enjoyed them and feel they were well worth the price. The bristles on the brush are a lot softer than the hard bristles you find on most brushes now a days so it took me a while to get used to using the comb to deranged my hair and them the brush to smooth and soften the hair. I feel so wonderfully feminine when using this set and it makes me happy so I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but after having these a few months just sitting on top of a dresser these brown spots have mysteriously started forming on all pieces of the \\&quot;silver\\&quot;. It looks terrible and won&#x27;t come off! I don&#x27;t know why......</li>
    <li> Not pleased. It was over priced to begin with, but it was a present for my daughter so, I said what the heck. She gets it, opens the package and the comb, literally falls apart into two pieces. I had to apologize to my daughter for a terrible gift.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves her set.  She proudly displays it on her vanity</li>
    <li> My cousins are going to love this gift. I saw them  and now want to get one for myself. This item will make any girl or woman feel like a princess. It was packaged well and came quickly.</li>
    <li> I really like the product.  It was well packaged and delivered in excellent shape.  I was impressed with the quality and style.  It was perfect.  I gave it to a girlfriend who loved it.  But she told me that the mirror became unglued, but not to worry because she would glue it back.  I recommend this product to anyone interested in this item.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 5 year old Granddaughter for Christmas as she is fascinated with the set I have on my dresser.  She really likes it and it looks very nice.  It seems well constructed and very pretty--I was pleased.</li>
    <li> When the package arrived, he mirror was no longer glued onto the mirror handle.  I expected that based on the other reviews.  A little krazy glue and its fit for a toddler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great gift at the price, I wasnt about to spend $60 or more for something that can be fixed with a little glue.</li>
    <li> the mirror quality is great nice and heavy and the mirror image quality is really great.  The comb and brush are about adequate more for looks I think.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this set.  It&#x27;s super shiny and the detailing is pretty.  It arrived quickly and was packaged well so it did not get scratched in transit.</li>
    <li> i got this for my 4 yearold.  she loves it.  Will make a great heirloom for her to pass along someday.</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful,  perfect weight, brush is more of a smoother doesn&#x27;t really catch hair, comb is strong and mirror is well balanced. overall very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This set replaced the old set and was exactly the same set that I had purchased many years ago. My wife loved it !</li>
