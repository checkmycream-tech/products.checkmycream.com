<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like this lipstick. I wish it had more pupple in it. It shows a little pink on me. I am African America.</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOVE IT! I got it because my friend that recently passed away loved this color and I wanna wear it on my nights out for her 💜</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS COLOR!  Lipstick is creamy and so long lasting!</li>
    <li> Love this color it&#x27;s smoth and don&#x27;t leave your lips cracked it goes on smoothly and stay smothley all nite</li>
    <li> This shade is awesome, and at MAC stores at the regular price.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping Exellent seller Strongly recommend it thank you .👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻</li>
    <li> Love the color and feelof this matte lipstick...has staying power that will last from morning until you decide to take it off!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice shade and I&#x27;m glad I added it to my collection.</li>
    <li> Such a stunning color last a long time couldn&#x27;t be happier! Would recommend to all my friends in a heart beat</li>
    <li> I really like this color. It&#x27;s the first Mac lipstick i&#x27;ve ever tried, and i really was amazed at how long it lasted. The color is bold and goes on smooth. It doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out, and did i mention that it lasted me all day- for like, i kid you not, ten hours? and it came off ONLY because i washed my face for bed, and it didn&#x27;t completely come off even then. I love how pretty it is, and i&#x27;m about med. brown complected with red undertones in my cheeks, for reference. I think it works great for those with dark brown skin tone who are looking for a lil &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; in their lives. It&#x27;s a lil pricey, but i guess that&#x27;s what you expect with Mac. But i would totally buy again, though with that said, i&#x27;m hoping i don&#x27;t run out any time soon.</li>
    <li> This color is awesome!</li>
    <li> Color is a little lighter when applied</li>
    <li> Very pretty fair skin dark eyes and hair? All set</li>
    <li> Amazing color. $16 in the store though</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this item on MAC&#x27;s site, but I was able to find it at Amazon. It&#x27;s an awesome color - beautiful! And I got it really quickly (which made me even happier!) It&#x27;s cold and snowy where I am, but that pop of color brightens up the most drab winter clothing. It was a bit more expensive than it would have been at the MAC site, but the availability made up for the extra cost.</li>
    <li> I really wish it would of delivered faster but when I got it I LOVED IT. It is the perfect color for summer</li>
    <li> Absoluetly love this color! Shipping was very fast. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> with this color i use wet and wild sugar plum lipstick to line my lips before applying heroine and it is flawless i mean flawless i cant get enough of it</li>
    <li> simply adore MAC lip sticks, this one is my favorite, amazing color, Matt texture. cant explain by words how pleased i am! will purchase one more when im run out :)</li>
    <li> Just letting u that the product was used I thought it was supposed to been new looked like it was swatched just by looking at it on the side of it that&#x27;s not good business after I paid my money u never win being dirty</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a couple of people with this lipstick color and decided to buy &amp; try it. It looks gorgeous on my skin tone. I have a caramel tone and it just blended in so nicely. Thanks!</li>
    <li> i just recived my lipstick and i took it to the closest mac store and compared it to the other mac lipsticks and it is defiantly FAKE. i am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is very unique. OMG! The shad is perfect and unique.  I love this lipstick so much. That I&#x27;ve placed in a order for more</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a violet MAC lipstick, then look no further.  Amazon has it! I received it in 2 days, and avoided the mall, which I try at every opportunity.  It stays on, and is just a great color.</li>
    <li> This is a true purple. On me I use very little and a little gloss and it looks a little edgy. I think on some darker women it might be less shocking  I love these lipsticks because they last</li>
    <li> I love this lip color! Perfect purple lipstick.</li>
    <li> Since the first time I have used M.A.C lipsticks, I have been a fan. Mainly, because of how long they last.The product is authentic and the color is GORGEOUS! All smiles :-)</li>
    <li> Love the color! I have to use a lip balm with it but thats ok. I shouldn&#x27;t have that problem in the summer.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great shade of lipstick. In my opinion one of Mac&#x27;s finest. Very very nice. Although I think it will go better on fairer skin .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must for all lipstick lovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering more of this!!</li>
    <li> i have about 30 mac lipsticks and this is my favorite one. it expensive and i wish i caught it in the store but this is worth every dollar. this is authentic and if you dont have this and your in love with mac your crazy! I can wear it in the summer and in the fall.. im a brownskinned girl like the singer brandy and i get compliments allllll day!! photo graphs well and all i would have to just die if i was to lose this lol</li>
    <li> I am very happy because I  owned the colour of the lipstick, and it was very nice on my skin and my face, thanks to the rapid delivery of this  product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s the first Mac Lipstick I bought. But I actually bought it at the store, and the price it&#x27;s the same. But I totally love it! The only thing is that my skin is white so it kind of looks purple/Pink on me. I love how it looks on my mom, she has darker skin and on her it just looks purple. Love it! And it lasts ALL day long. Even after I eat the color is still there. Once again, LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> best lipstick you can use</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colors from Mac, Stays on for a long time just like any Mac lipstick. Great quality</li>
    <li> Item didn&#x27;t show up on time but once it did, I loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not light-skinned but it&#x27;s so beautiful. Though I suggest using a lip primer first since it&#x27;s a bit dry (?).</li>
    <li> Its AWESOME I LOVE IT.  If u add lipgloss intop it looks  lighter.looks very nice I get complements all the time. Definitely with buying!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping will buy again</li>
    <li> Love it!!you can wear it anywhere it doesn&#x27;t smuge and it lasts all day even when you eat or drink.definitely will buy this item again</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great fall and winter color. MAC products never disappoint. If your looking for a Matte lipstick this a good one.</li>
    <li> Received item very quickly, in perfect condition. This lipstick is almost impossible to find sometimes so I was very excited to get a hold of it.</li>
    <li> Purple is my favorite color and this does not disappoint. I love this shade love how it stands out. MAC should add it as a permanent color.</li>
    <li> MAC true to color presented in ad and worth the money...if you have olive to dark complexion it will pop on you.</li>
    <li> mac lipstick are the best</li>
    <li> I love the color buy why so expensive I got it on Nordstrom for 16 dollars 😂</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not matte but I still love the color it looks dark but it&#x27;s a vibrant purple.  It makes my lips pop !</li>
    <li> Slow shipping but I love the product</li>
    <li> I am in love with this color.</li>
    <li> the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it makes my lip dries the color is very pretty it last about 3 hrs</li>
    <li> This is got to be my favorite lipstick! And I&#x27;ve got a few!&lt;br /&gt;The shade is perfect, it will stay on for a long time. It won&#x27;t dry out your lips.&lt;br /&gt;You will really feel like a heroine wearing it :) For statement colors such as this one, don&#x27;t buy the drugstore alternative... Definitely go with a good quality product.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this color on me, the color literally lasts all day, i just love everything about this lipstick....MAC is the business:)</li>
    <li> I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeee it! been wanting it for a longgggg time!! came super quick! ..in a huge box hahahahah but came! love it :D</li>
    <li> Love this color!! I just love MAC lipsticks!!!</li>
    <li> I will say, that as an extremely pale woman, this lipstick looks much more pink than purple on me. But it is long lasting and very beautiful. I had no problems with it being drying, but I have a very strict lip balm regimen so that probably counteracts any drying.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! Dry formula so staying power is great and last even longer if you fill your lips in with a lip pencil. I did think that the color would be more vivid. I already have many purple/violet lippies so I&#x27;m always comparing them with each other!</li>
    <li> Think I got ripped off. The lipstick cakes and doesn&#x27;t go on smooth at all. Mac lipsticks don&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a bright color but I can&#x27;t help but love it!!</li>
    <li> love this color and I could wear all day and not have to reapply!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time &amp; as described. . Love the color. .</li>
    <li> i love this heroine color</li>
    <li> OK. So this is supposed to be super violet and damn well straight it is! I am super in love with the color. It;s so stunning and catches attention very well. I love MAC as a makeup brand too of course.</li>
    <li> Love this color but you do better going to Mac Store to purchase. Its only $16.....verses $23 + 4.99.....</li>
