      <li>I&#x27;m in Nursing School, living in San Diego (originally from Seattle), and my skin was breaking out more than ever due to stress, sunscreen use, etc.</li>

      <li>Highly recommended, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>While the Eminence line is all high quality stuff, it is important to select a product that is right for your facial make up-.</li>

      <li>There&#x27;s no exfoliating particles in it directly, it uses the blueberry acidity for a very gentle exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many other cleansers, but this is the one I&#x27;m sticking with!</li>
      <li>It has a slightly tingling feeling on my face at first, and after it&#x27;s been washed away, my skin feels clean and fresh (but not tight).</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel soft and keeps my skin from becoming dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The smell is great, but the the title name of this product is misleading. I thought I bought exfoliating product, which means with a little particles that gently exfoliates the skin. However, the product has just a creamy  texture and nothing else. It may act like a regular milky cleanser, but NOT as an defoliator!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand the reason this company chose to name this product as an defoliator cleanser. Very disappointed for the misleading!!!</li>
    <li> This cleanser changed my skin!! I&#x27;m in Nursing School, living in San Diego (originally from Seattle), and my skin was breaking out more than ever due to stress, sunscreen use, etc. I switched from a cleanser that had chemicals (that I had been using for years), and I will never go back! I don&#x27;t break out anymore, and my skin feels brighter and more youthful :) I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> My go-to facial cleanser.  Smells good and keeps my face soft. I love it.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I wash with the Blueberry Soy face wash with a little of the Strawberry Rhubard Dermafoliant mixed in. I follow with the Stone Crop Hydrating Mist and then the Coconut Moisturizer. Once a week I use the Pumpkin Enzyme Peel. My skin looks fantastic and this is the first time in living memory that I haven&#x27;t had itchy flaky skin in subfreezing temps.  I&#x27;m 32 and my skin looked every bit of it and then some before I started using Eminence products back in July. Now my skin looks as good as it did at 25. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have recently become a Eminence junkie and this was my first investment item.  Needless to say, I am already onto my 3rd bottle because I am not committed to this.  It is an enzyme exfoliator, so not harsh abrasives, and it makes your skin so clean! IT smells like blueberry yogurt and I will continue to use! Perfect for normal to dry skin!</li>
    <li> This product smells like candy, and didn&#x27;t clean my skin. It felt like a layer of oil was left. They use Corn oil which is terrible for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love Eminence! This cleanser is great. I almost couldn&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s cleansing but my skin is very smooth and happy, and makeup applies nicely after using it. I too thought the pump was defective but I was persistent and it eventually popped up.</li>
    <li> Best face wash for dry skin</li>
    <li> Nice cleanser. Not drying.</li>
    <li> I like eminence products</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot but I&#x27;ve had a problem with the bottle, (3 different purchases so it&#x27;s not a fluke) These bottles appear to consistently have a problem where the pump top doesn&#x27;t spring up and I&#x27;m unable to dispense the cleanser without unscrewing the top and awkwardly getting into the bottle.</li>
    <li> I received another Eminence product as a gift and I was really impressed. I used this at the end of the day and I love the way it smells and the way my skin feels after using it... very soft. However, this does not remove makeup. After washing my face with this, I used my Clinique Clarifying Lotion and the cotton pad was brown. There was definitely a lot of makeup left behind.</li>
    <li> One of my many favorites from Eminence.  Smells great and feels great going on.  A definite must have for your skin care routine.</li>
    <li> It smells great! However, it&#x27;s not foaming and it&#x27;s not exfoliating. There are no &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; elements to this. It actually feels like lotion with a  nice scent. That&#x27;s it. I can&#x27;t even say it&#x27;s a cleansing item because I don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin each day and I still experience breakouts occasionally. Oh well, we shall see.</li>
    <li> This smells fantastic,think blueberries. The product doesn&#x27;t foam and feels almost like a lotion but it still gives a moisturized clean feeling and it seems to work great with clearing up my acne. I completely recommend it for acne suffers with dry skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> It smelled really good and I wanted it to work on my skin but it did not work on my combination(acne) skin. It felt little too oily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after having an amazing facial at a salon. It didn&#x27;t fail me. Not only does it smell amazing, but there aren&#x27;t any harsh suds to strip your skin. After cleansing, your face is super smooth and silky. I can&#x27;t wait to wash my face everyday!</li>
    <li> Love it and will probably buy more when I am out!!!!!  Makes my face feel soft and keeps my skin from becoming dry.</li>
    <li> A very nice, gentle cleanser. Leaves skin ckean without stripping, drying or irritating. It smells like blueberries , but subtle.</li>
    <li> This my favorite cleanser. It is very gentle, so I like to use it with my Konjac sponge for a little extra cleansing oomph. My skin feels soft and smooth. Update 11/9/15- I bought a new bottle in September when I started to get low. I just opened it last week, and while I was washing my face I noticed a terrible smell and my face started to burn a little. I tried it again today and got the same results. I still love Eminence, but I think I got an expired product.</li>
    <li> What happened to the exfoliants?  Nice enough cleanser but I&#x27;m not feeling the exfoliating action that I expected.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser does not dry my skin out. Helps keep it clear with out being drying like typical acne products.</li>
    <li> The blueberry smell is so refreshing and yummy I feel like my skin can breathe better this line in general is phenomenal I love eminence</li>
    <li> this is the best face care i have ever purchased</li>
    <li> Its alright, I love emincence products because of no harsh ingredients. I think I need to buy one of there acne products because this and there coconut one is not keeping my black heads or my acne away. It smells good and is super gentle to my face but i need something a little stronger, it doesnt really feel like im washing my face...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cleanser.  The exfoliation is so subtle it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but instead leaves it smooth and silky.  It makes my face feel clean and removes makeup effectively without excessive drying.  I have tried many other cleansers, but this is the one I&#x27;m sticking with!</li>
    <li> Cleans without drying out.  This product has really been a plus for my skin.</li>
    <li> i love the eminence products. never fails me...but i wish i could afford so much more than just one product</li>
    <li> I usually love Eminence products, but this one did not meet my expectations. While it smells nice, it is an odd purple color, and it&#x27;s so creamy that I have no idea how it could possibly exfoliate my skin. Do not love this cleanser.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for moderately dry skin. The Blueberry Soy Exfoliating cleanser is not your typical exfoliant, in that there are no sandpaper-like little stones in it. It is totally smooth, and smells delicious. My skin looks brighter and feels great using this once per day. While the Eminence line is all high quality stuff, it is important to select a product that is right for your facial make up-. The Stone Crop Gel Moisturizer was initially recommended to me; it dried me out terribly, but worked perfectly for a friend with more oily skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and smooth. I just don&#x27;t feel it cleanse as well as other products I&#x27;ve used. I also don&#x27;t feel the exfoliating affect.</li>
    <li> I love Eminence products and this is no exception.  The face wash has a rich, thick consistency and smells great.  I read some negative reviews on the exfoliating factor, but keep in mind this product uses a gel exfoliant, not a grit exfoliant.  I recommend adding some of the Eminence Strawberry Rhubard Dermafoliant to the product for a great gritty exfoliant.</li>
    <li> I have used Eminence in the past and I am never disappointed.  This product has a Wonderful Scent and I Love how my skin feels.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser, it&#x27;s gentle and leaves me skin feeling clean but not stripped.  I use it every day.  There&#x27;s no exfoliating particles in it directly, it uses the blueberry acidity for a very gentle exfoliation.  To kick this up a little I add a shake of the strawberry rhubarb dermafoliant into a pump of this and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> After I tried the Eminence Blueberry Soy night cream ( it is exquisite!) I had to try this accompanying cleanser.  It did not disappoint! To have a product that smells as divine as this does and also not be filled with chemicals and tons of preservatives -- is amazing! It has a wonderful, creamy texture...though it&#x27;s called  &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34;, there are no granules that you can actually feel. It is refreshing and leaves my skin feeling  clean and so soft,  but not dry. I would say it&#x27;s probably best for more mature skin that needs extra moisture. My 23 year old daughter tried it, and she said it was too thick and heavy for her....though, she too loved the smell! Though it is a little pricey for me, I have found that a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s worth it! I will definitely buy again! Fabulous product!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 2 weeks -- texture has improved, pores are nice and clean. Looks and smells like blueberry yogurt, which is fine with me, is non-drying and only a little bit is needed. My 58 year-old skin is very happy!</li>
    <li> I am new to Eminence products, but what I have tried so far has me quite impressed. I&#x27;ve switched from dermatologist-prescribed products such as Obagi and Skinceuticals as, at sixty, my skin feels like it&#x27;s getting dryer and more sensitized to the chemicals in these products.&lt;br /&gt;This face wash is a sense-tripping experience of the best kind! The smell and creamy texture, like my night cream by Eminence, does not leave my skin feeling greasy at all. It feels very balanced and good.</li>
    <li> The blueberry cleanser is super gentle, smells great, leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.  I have sensitive skin and it is great.</li>
    <li> This product smells so good!!!  Great exfoliation too.</li>
    <li> Love Eminence, arrived on time and as described, would buy again from this Seller</li>
    <li> Eminence is a great line of beauty lotions, creams ect.  I have sensitive skin so have to be careful.  The products are marvelously scented.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous face washes in my search for a natural one that worked.  This makes my dry sensitive skin soft and hydrated.  Love this cleanser and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Love it! My face feels smooth and clean after use.</li>
    <li> I love these Eminence products.  Great for the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. it is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. Highly recommended, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different cleansers for my combination/slightly sensitive skin, and I really like this one. I am using my second bottle now and plan to continue using this. It has a slightly tingling feeling on my face at first, and after it&#x27;s been washed away, my skin feels clean and fresh (but not tight). I feel that my breakouts have reduced. Each bottle lasts about 4 months. I also love the blueberry smell. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love eminence products and this cleanser is great for normal to dry skin and smells wonderful! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Not only does this product smell delightful but it is so creamy and soothing to your skin. It has really helped my face with uneven skin tones and helped clear up some dry areas also. Highly recommend this product. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
