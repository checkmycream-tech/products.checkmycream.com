      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>I love this product, the quality &amp; the fragrance is awesome.</li>
      <li>This is a really great, innovative product!</li>
      <li>my wife love it, she said is very good.</li>
      <li>Although this is a good product, I have curly hair</li>
      <li>Very Pleased.</li>
      <li>I should look for more on your site!</li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>I am in LOVE with this product!</li>
      <li>Very easy.  </li>
      <li>Great balance, fair price, I highly recommend for those who like cremes.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best when dealing with curly locks</li>
      <li>The smell was great at first, but now it&#x27;s unbearable.</li>
      <li>I love my silver/white/salt-and-pepper hair and I noticed that it really glowed beautifully whenever I had it cut by my hairdresser.</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this product is.</li>
      <li>It provides more definition to my curls and prevents that bushy look.</li>
      <li>Unless, that is, you like the greasy look, want to ruin your brushes, and love the smell of plastic.</li>
      <li>Great Seller, Fast Shipment,</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s curly most of the time.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I opened the bottle to check it out, and it smelled more like cheap hair gel.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair so easy to work with#</li>
      <li>She loves the hold and how easy it is to use.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the genuine article.</li>
      <li>I still liked this product for styling and hold, but Round Trip held my curls better, and prevent frizz better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it does a good job of controlling the frizz of my curly hair.</li>
      <li>This product is great to use everyday.</li>
      <li>Great product, put on wet, dry time is reduced, leaving light conditioning and light hold.</li>
      <li>Gives it body and keeps it soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>just a VERY tiny amount is needed every time (spread in your palm then through your hair after washing and before styling), but it really makes your hair shine and look really healthy.</li>
      <li>I just had to wait more to the hair dry completed before using hot tools</li>
      <li>A little of this product goes a long way, but it provides good styling and light conditioning, along with faster drying time.</li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down, keep the hair shiny and beautiful all day long.</li>
      <li>I love Paul Mitchell Quick Slip, but the one that I ordered and received recently got promptly sent back.  </li>
      <li>Using too much will make your hair a bit lifeless.</li>
      <li>I put about a nickel-sized amount on my hair after washing and towel-drying and it really moisturizes and smooths my hair.</li>
      <li>The product doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair anymore, either.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Paula</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to do much at all for my hair.</li>
      <li>I sometimes wear my hair straight</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This gives a nice hold with very little product.</li>
      <li>only usage tips are (A) use less than you think you need and (B) apply when your hair is fairly damp.</li>
      <li>While it worked OK at first, I have thrown it away in the past week.</li>
      <li>One of the few products that I love and use.</li>
      <li>and I think Paul Mitchell Round Trip works better for curly hair.  </li>
      <li>On a clean hair Day 1 when I use everything, it&#x27;s not really noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I have short hair, so my first bottle of Paul Mitchell Quickslip lasted me over two years.</li>
      <li>My first and only experience with Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It was flowery and sweet at first, but I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it now.</li>
      <li>Just use less or clean your comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>counterfeit or REALLY REALLY old stock .</li>
      <li>I took to spraying perfume directly onto my hair to make it smell</li>
      <li>Works great on my hair (chemically relaxed); I have a pixie cut and use it to slick down my sides and the back of hair (hair is tapered).</li>
      <li>Namely, it controls my dry, curly hair in the very arid climate in which I live.</li>
      <li>I love this lightweight product, because it controls without making my hair flakey with white stuff from gel, or frizzy because it&#x27;s not strong enough.</li>
      <li>I can use it by itself and it tames my long, fine, wavy hair without weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>I have used Quick Slip for a couple of years, and what was in there smelled nothing like what I have used in the past.  </li>
      <li>Very disappointed especially after the great reviews I read, which is why I purchased in the first place.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and also helps it to dry faster during blow drying.</li>

<li> It makes my hair soft and also helps it to dry faster during blow drying.</li>
<li> I spray a light mist (water) and a little of this goes a long way to help tame my frizzies.</li>
<li> It does not weigh my hair down, no heavy product build up, no hardness or flaking...</li>
<li> Or can layer with other products if doing extra styling.</li>
<li> I tend to have dry, frizzy hair.</li>
<li> This can also be used on dry hair to help style, which does seem to work.  </li>
<li> I bought this hoping my hair would dry quicker, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> I bought a bottle of this in my local salon a few months back.</li>
<li> I used it religiously to try and make my hair less silky and make it styleable.</li>
<li> Finally, regarding the person who complained about residue on their brush/comb... that can be expected of any such product.</li>
<li> It also cuts the drying time about in half, which helps ease heat-styling damage to my hair.</li>
<li> I use this with a number of other things to try to tame my hair, and I think the combination of products works.  </li>
<li> Applying when your hair is wet makes it easier to distribute a small amount throughout your hair.</li>
<li> It was either fake or very old</li>
<li> This product cut the drying time of my hair in half and my hair is just past my shoulders.</li>
<li> I have not tried the product yet, however it came in a dirty bottle that looked like it had been opened and possibly used.  </li>
<li> The only problem that I have with this product is that it really stinks - almost of urine.  </li>
<li> The outside of the bottle was dirty and looked like it had some stickers taken off, just like someone else mentioned.  </li>
<li> I agree with above as a master barber who uses pm products exclusively , I must warn that these are either stolen fake or outdated</li>
<li> While it did cut down on drying time, it just makes my hair look and feel dirty.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very hard to find in the beauty supply stores, so when I found it on Amazon, I immediately bought it.</li>
<li> On a second, non-washing Day 2, though, the smell can be sickening.</li>
<li> but I think I bought the wrong one without noticing.</li>
<li> I have a difficult time trying to find it, but you had it.</li>
<li> It looks like there were stickers taken off of the bottle and then held by someone w/ filthy, dirty hands.  </li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> It just smells disgusting.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s terrible now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> My first and only experience with Amazon.  Very easy.  I should look for more on your site!</li>
    <li> This product is great to use everyday. I doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down, keep the hair shiny and beautiful all day long.</li>
    <li> I love my silver/white/salt-and-pepper hair and I noticed that it really glowed beautifully whenever I had it cut by my hairdresser. Turns out she uses this every time on my hair. It&#x27;s very hard to find in the beauty supply stores, so when I found it on Amazon, I immediately bought it. This will last forever! just a VERY tiny amount is needed every time (spread in your palm then through your hair after washing and before styling), but it really makes your hair shine and look really healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it does a good job of controlling the frizz of my curly hair.</li>

    <li> One of the few products that I love and use. It works as described and doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy</li>

    <li> Does wonders for my wife&#x27;s hair.  She loves the hold and how easy it is to use.  Will buy this product again</li>
    <li> my wife love it, she said is very good.</li>
    <li> I like this product - it helps to expedite blowdrying my hair in the mornings. I will probably order more, since it is difficult to find it at any local store.</li>
    <li> A little of this product goes a long way, but it provides good styling and light conditioning, along with faster drying time. I use it after shampooing and occasionally later on to enhance style.</li>
    <li> I love this product, the quality &amp; the fragrance is awesome. I have a difficult time trying to find it, but you had it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched over to Paul Mitchell products and this is one of my favorites. I spray a light mist (water) and a little of this goes a long way to help tame my frizzies.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to receive the spray product but I think I bought the wrong one without noticing. Not a problem: I tried the product and althought it&#x27;s dificult to say if injured or not your hair after doing babyliss or whatever, I think it did protected my hair. I just had to wait more to the hair dry completed before using hot tools</li>
    <li> counterfeit or REALLY REALLY old stock .</li>
    <li> This gives a nice hold with very little product.</li>
    <li> I love Paul Mitchell Quick Slip, but the one that I ordered and received recently got promptly sent back.  The outside of the bottle was dirty and looked like it had some stickers taken off, just like someone else mentioned.  I opened the bottle to check it out, and it smelled more like cheap hair gel.  I have used Quick Slip for a couple of years, and what was in there smelled nothing like what I have used in the past.  It was either fake or very old is my guess.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this in my local salon a few months back. I used it religiously to try and make my hair less silky and make it styleable. While it worked OK at first, I have thrown it away in the past week. It&#x27;s terrible now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered product residue has caked onto my brush and comb, so I can only assume it caked onto my hair as well. The smell was great at first, but now it&#x27;s unbearable. It was flowery and sweet at first, but I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it now. Almost musky and plasticy in a way. It just smells disgusting. I took to spraying perfume directly onto my hair to make it smell okay.  The product doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair anymore, either. While it did cut down on drying time, it just makes my hair look and feel dirty. It didn&#x27;t give me any hold or anything, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product! Find something else. I&#x27;m still looking, but this is not something you want to buy. Unless, that is, you like the greasy look, want to ruin your brushes, and love the smell of plastic.</li>
    <li> I use this with a number of other things to try to tame my hair, and I think the combination of products works.  This can also be used on dry hair to help style, which does seem to work.  The only problem that I have with this product is that it really stinks - almost of urine.  On a clean hair Day 1 when I use everything, it&#x27;s not really noticeable.  On a second, non-washing Day 2, though, the smell can be sickening.</li>
    <li> I have short hair, so my first bottle of Paul Mitchell Quickslip lasted me over two years. Granted, I only used it about twice a week, but it achieved the desired results. Namely, it controls my dry, curly hair in the very arid climate in which I live. It provides more definition to my curls and prevents that bushy look. As for those suggesting you not buy it online, don&#x27;t pay them any attention. I purchased a replacement bottle of Quickslip here and it&#x27;s the genuine article. I compared the packaging, labeling, aroma consistency and performance. There is no difference. Finally, regarding the person who complained about residue on their brush/comb... that can be expected of any such product. Just use less or clean your comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only usage tips are (A) use less than you think you need and (B) apply when your hair is fairly damp. Using too much will make your hair a bit lifeless. Applying when your hair is wet makes it easier to distribute a small amount throughout your hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so easy to work with#</li>
    <li> I sometimes wear my hair straight but it&#x27;s curly most of the time. I love this lightweight product, because it controls without making my hair flakey with white stuff from gel, or frizzy because it&#x27;s not strong enough. Great balance, fair price, I highly recommend for those who like cremes.</li>
