### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Me and my husband were really impressed</li>
      <li>Perfect for learning to juggle.</li>
      <li>This stress ball is perfect for me!  </li>
      <li>She is very happy with it!</li>
      <li>ErgoBeads is a very good help for me and my hand.</li>
      <li>Works great for giving blood and plasma.</li>
      <li>The ball was great.  </li>
      <li>These bead balls are great for those of us who write a lot, or just use our hands a lot (repetive motions).  </li>
      <li>And I just love it!!</li>
      <li>and I loved it.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>While the ball itself wasn&#x27;t the magic bullet (bandaids on my fingers ended up substantially helping) - I&#x27;d say the stress ball was well made and fulfilled my expectations in terms of what I was looking for (an easy to squish stress ball made out of pleasant material).</li>
      <li>good fit and texture, love it</li>
      <li>Hand Excerciser is more to the point.  </li>
      <li>This ball has an easy, pliable texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I think it would be fine for a woman or a smaller-handed man,  </li>
      <li>Very well pleased :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect sized instant mood lifter; soft and squishy in all the right ways!</li>
      <li>Quiet to squeeze and looks good.</li>
      <li>The beads make it more fun and is a perfect size, just a little bit smaller than a baseball.</li>
      <li>Great little exercise ball.  </li>
      <li>Like a really pleasant mini bean bag with smooth little beads inside quality flexible fabric...instead of those hard styrofoam balls that don&#x27;t feel good at all!</li>
      <li>Still 5 stars and totally worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>These balls are wonderful: they are soft enough to be flexible for fingers with arthritis and firm enough to provide good exercise.</li>
      <li>Bag is loose and not really hard to squeeze which is good for me with arthritis.  </li>
      <li>The inside of the ball is filled with little beads which you can easily move around with your fingers.</li>
      <li>Like I used it daily and the delivery is quick.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty cool stress ball, just like the other colors but a 1 pack.</li>
      <li>so I had to get a new one</li>
      <li>Finally found exactly what I was looking for in a stress ball.</li>
      <li>I am 41 years old and have been searching for sensory items to use for stress relief at work and at home.  </li>
      <li>This was a gift; mine are over a year old.</li>
      <li>The outer shell is made out of t-shirt material which is soft to the touch and the beads inside are small (about the size of a BB) which makes the ball easy to manipulate in my hand.  </li>
      <li>Its fabric is very soft, slick and cool to the touch.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a fantastic little buy.</li>
      <li>This little thingy is great, I&#x27;m a kid in high shool and got this for when I get mad at video games or something</li>

<li> This little thingy is great, I&#x27;m a kid in high shool and got this for when I get mad at video games or something</li>
<li> I purchased this item as an alternate to a &amp;#34;stress ball&amp;#34;; I&#x27;ve found other stress balls have been to firm and required too much hand tension to squish.</li>
<li> The old was was getting little hold in it</li>
<li> but I do wish I had bought a larger, harder one.  </li>
<li> It feels like you are mushing dozens of small soft beads.</li>
<li> external material is thick and won&#x27;t fall apart (like other soft stress balls I&#x27;ve purchased that are made out of flour).</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a bit big for small hands but still works.  </li>
<li> I ended up sending the Yuck-E-Ball back because the balls inside were too large and hard rubber which made it difficult to manipulate in my hand.  </li>
<li> Would recommended for starting out slow.</li>
<li> Got for my elderly mother who had worn out her previous one.  </li>
<li> I have used it everyday and seems to be helping my arm.  </li>
<li> As usually Amazon came through for me.  </li>
<li> My only criticism is the annoying little tag, which I carefully removed.</li>
<li> There is no rubber weird smell like other products</li>
<li> You can even use it to play catch with yourself if you get bored.</li>
<li> They come with tags you can&#x27;t remove without cutting off</li>
<li> so that&#x27;s really annoying</li>

    <li> This is a pretty cool stress ball, just like the other colors but a 1 pack. They come with tags you can&#x27;t remove without cutting off so that&#x27;s really annoying but it does its job as a stress ball. Quiet to squeeze and looks good.</li>
    <li> I think it would be fine for a woman or a smaller-handed man,  but I do wish I had bought a larger, harder one.  I like the quality and will look for the same brand with the characteristics I want.</li>
    <li> This was given to me years ago as a gift and I loved it. The old was was getting little hold in it so I had to get a new one and I start looking for it. As usually Amazon came through for me.  ErgoBeads is a very good help for me and my hand.</li>
    <li> I use it as mouse pad!! it is my second one!! And I just love it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as an alternate to a &amp;#34;stress ball&amp;#34;; I&#x27;ve found other stress balls have been to firm and required too much hand tension to squish. This ball has an easy, pliable texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The external material is thick and won&#x27;t fall apart (like other soft stress balls I&#x27;ve purchased that are made out of flour). The inside of the ball is filled with little beads which you can easily move around with your fingers. I purchased this ball for trichotillomania and skin picking disorder. While the ball itself wasn&#x27;t the magic bullet (bandaids on my fingers ended up substantially helping) - I&#x27;d say the stress ball was well made and fulfilled my expectations in terms of what I was looking for (an easy to squish stress ball made out of pleasant material).</li>
    <li> These bead balls are great for those of us who write a lot, or just use our hands a lot (repetive motions).  This helps to re-acquire the fluidity in your hands. I would say the term Hand Excerciser is more to the point.  Stress Ball to me, is a mis-leading.</li>
    <li> Got for my elderly mother who had worn out her previous one.  She is very happy with it!</li>
    <li> The ball was great.  Sprinkles ate it and agreed.  So I bought a solid rubber ball.</li>
    <li> It is not an optimal feeling. It doesn&#x27;t stay together well and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of structure.</li>
    <li> This little thingy is great, I&#x27;m a kid in high shool and got this for when I get mad at video games or something and I take it to school now too. Its fabric is very soft, slick and cool to the touch. The beads make it more fun and is a perfect size, just a little bit smaller than a baseball. You can even use it to play catch with yourself if you get bored. Overall it is a fantastic little buy.</li>
    <li> Bag is loose and not really hard to squeeze which is good for me with arthritis.  There is no rubber weird smell like other products it&#x27;s a bit big for small hands but still works.  It feels like you are mushing dozens of small soft beads. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> These balls are wonderful: they are soft enough to be flexible for fingers with arthritis and firm enough to provide good exercise. Very satisfied with this purchase. They also wear well. This was a gift; mine are over a year old.</li>

    <li> Great little exercise ball.  I have used it everyday and seems to be helping my arm.  Would recommended for starting out slow.</li>
    <li> good fit and texture, love it</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old and have been searching for sensory items to use for stress relief at work and at home.  I purchased this stress ball along with a Yuck-E-Ball.  I ended up sending the Yuck-E-Ball back because the balls inside were too large and hard rubber which made it difficult to manipulate in my hand.  This stress ball is perfect for me!  The outer shell is made out of t-shirt material which is soft to the touch and the beads inside are small (about the size of a BB) which makes the ball easy to manipulate in my hand.  I find myself using this stress ball often, it is relaxing to me.</li>
    <li> Perfect for learning to juggle.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery! Very well pleased :)</li>
    <li> Works great for giving blood and plasma.</li>
    <li> Me and my husband were really impressed I Like I used it daily and the delivery is quick.</li>
