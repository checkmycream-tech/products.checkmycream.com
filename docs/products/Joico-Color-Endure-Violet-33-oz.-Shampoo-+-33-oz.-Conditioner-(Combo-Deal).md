      <li>Have you ever tried to clean up shampoo?</li>
      <li>Receive it super fast!!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with the nearly full bottles.</li>

      <li>This product not only leaves her blonde looking great, but also shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>I like it better than the old formula.</li>
      <li>changed my color to a medium golden brown, something darker that wouldn&#x27;t look as washed out against my skin.</li>
      <li>But hey, those pesky golden undertones are history!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>She says that it&#x27;s an amazing product and takes the brassiness right out of her hair and leaves it birght and practically white.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right thing to do.</li>
      <li>Buy it right now.</li>
      <li>I thought &amp;#34;Hmmm, maybe if this shampoo/conditioner tones my hair right, I won&#x27;t have to do another process on it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It will simply be used sparingly, after I get my hair to the right shade, and not so quickly after a chemical process!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, but still only about 80% of the way to where I want it, and with yellow/orange undertones.</li>
      <li>i remembered when i first started getting highlights, my stylist recommended pureology(purple bottles).</li>
      <li>if you plan on buying it buy a smaller bottle and try it you may have a better experience than</li>
      <li>and seldom is it a pretty red, but more of a Bozo orange shade.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I asked for.</li>
      <li>I started with light golden blonde hair and did the first process of lightening my hair up a ton with a L&#x27;oreal Les Blondissimes box.</li>
      <li>It removes the brassy tones and brightens your color, also leaves your hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>My hair is golden blonde with a range of cool to platinum highlights.</li>
      <li>The picture posted by the seller has the large bottles pictured with pumps and they do have intact pumps.</li>
      <li>I use this daily and find that my hair has taken on a slight lavender look, which I think is great.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t expect suds &amp; theres noy much of a smell to it.</li>
      <li>I rinsed my hair really really well</li>
      <li>: long, straight, in good condition, i get partial highlights every 2 months.</li>
      <li>Could leave a light purple tint to your hair if you don&#x27;t get it all out or leave it on too long</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try to make this short and sweet...</li>
      <li>Clariol Shimmering Lights worked much better and the price was less.</li>
      <li>and I love my hair WHITE blonde.</li>
      <li>I received the wrong shampoo, great price</li>
      <li>I normally use either Loreal everpure for color treated hair, or loreal color vibrancy shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>However i decided to follow my normal routine to see the end result, which is: put on  Neutrogena</li>
      <li>my conclusion with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t clean very well, it doesn&#x27;t condition very well, and the few times i used it</li>
      <li>No sign of orange at all and the red highlights in my hair are a very true red in sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo did sting a bit the first few times I used it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because it got such great reviews, but I was not impressed.  </li>
      <li>It works, my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>The extra shampooing really irritated my scalp, i was scratching my head constantly.</li>
      <li>It has kept my hair blonde &amp; soft!</li>
      <li>I continued using the Joico with the new color, in hopes that it would prevent the orange shade I usually get with golden colors.</li>
      <li>Since she has been using this shampoo her hair looks natural blonde.  </li>
      <li>, just true, rich red highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other bluing shampoos in the past, like Clairol&#x27;s Silver lights and Pantene&#x27;s bluing shampoo for blonde or grey hair.</li>

<li> As long as her hair is blonde, she will be using this shampoo.  </li>
<li> /&gt;-I tried using the conditioner only with my regular shampoo: my hair was very dry.</li>
<li> It works every single time I use it (about once a week), and it extends the life of my highlights for an extra month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> i also tried cleaning my scalp with my regular shampoo then applying some joico shampoo and follow with my regular conditioner like other people using this product</li>
<li> It takes weeks to deep condition my hair back to life and it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
<li> I purchased this for a friend, she likes it and uses it, but it has a bit of a strange smell.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s like using a professional shampoo on your hair but half the price!</li>
<li> triple moisture silk leave in cream, then blow dry, then straighten</li>
<li> I used an ash blonde color on my hair and still had brassy, slightly orange toned roots</li>
<li> They helped a little, but never truly knocked out all the yellow undertones like the Joico does.</li>
<li> First of all, sorry for the long review, just sharing my experience with this product.&lt;br</li>
<li> She uses it everyday as her daily shampoo.</li>
<li> It was what I expected.</li>
<li> But just be careful</li>
<li> Since i normally wash my hair every 2/3 days, i tried again when my hair was less dirty, and i had the same result.&lt;br /&gt;-I tried using the shampoo only with my regular conditioner</li>
<li> Toned down the yellowish color buildup in my grey hair.</li>
<li> this too was a disaster for me, not only does it add time to my shower routine, since supposedly you need to leave joico at least 3 mins.</li>
<li> Normally my hair pulls red like crazy when it&#x27;s bleached, colored, etc.</li>
<li> Half of it was already wasted.</li>
<li> It did the trick in a couple weeks, maybe a little TOO well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received the wrong item and the item i did receive was leaking everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Ehh....The condition is a nice addition to my routine but I do not like the shampoo. 50/50 here. I dyed my hair blond in March and I was looking for a shampoo/conditioner set that kept it bright. I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo awesome price</li>
    <li> My favorite toner for my platinum hair</li>
    <li> I can tell in the future this product will be a hair-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will walk you through my thought process up until this moment. I am aiming for white-blonde hair. I started with light golden blonde hair and did the first process of lightening my hair up a ton with a L&#x27;oreal Les Blondissimes box. It&#x27;s very light, but still only about 80% of the way to where I want it, and with yellow/orange undertones. I thought &amp;#34;Hmmm, maybe if this shampoo/conditioner tones my hair right, I won&#x27;t have to do another process on it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it works. It works fantastically. My hair is now an interesting silvery violet shade. But hey, those pesky golden undertones are history!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping this stuff. I freaking love it! It works, my hair is soft and shiny. It&#x27;s just also silver-purple currently. It will simply be used sparingly, after I get my hair to the right shade, and not so quickly after a chemical process!!</li>
    <li> It was what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo/conditioner! Smells great and hair feels soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> When this arrived it had exploded in transit so it was a mess! I had purple shampoo all over the place. Half of it was already wasted. So annoyed. I wrote and asked for a refund and got no reply! Have you ever tried to clean up shampoo? It&#x27;s impossible when there is so much of it. It&#x27;s also supposed to help maintain hair color, it doesn&#x27;t. What it does do is turn the skin around my finger nails purple. If you get it in your ears, be sure to clean them out or your ears have purple goo in them. I will never buy this product or from this retailer again. If you sell these type of products, figure out how to ship them so they arrive in tact!  If a customer asks for a refund, reply to them even if its no. It&#x27;s just the right thing to do.</li>
    <li> I hated the way it made my hair feel</li>
    <li> The picture posted by the seller has the large bottles pictured with pumps and they do have intact pumps. My daughter has blonde hair and I order this product for her to keep her foil highlights looking good. She is a teen and has very thick hair and it is very difficult to find a quality product that moisturizes without leaving too oily or too dry. This product not only leaves her blonde looking great, but also shiny and healthy. I think it&#x27;s great for once or maybe twice a week shampoos if you&#x27;re a daily shampoo person like she is.</li>
    <li> excellent shampoo for blond highlights</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She says that it&#x27;s an amazing product and takes the brassiness right out of her hair and leaves it birght and practically white. She uses it everyday as her daily shampoo.</li>
    <li> First of all, sorry for the long review, just sharing my experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair: long, straight, in good condition, i get partial highlights every 2 months. I normally use either Loreal everpure for color treated hair, or loreal color vibrancy shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this shampoo to help my hair from getting brassy and to extend the life of my highlights. I bought Joico shampoo/conditioner because it had very good reviews in all the websites i read not just amazon. I&#x27;m disappointed because no matter how i used joico, it just made a mess out of my hair. here is why:&lt;br /&gt;- I tried using the two products together: shampoo then condition as usual: my scalp was dirty, my hair stiff and dull with a lot of residue. Since i normally wash my hair every 2/3 days, i tried again when my hair was less dirty, and i had the same result.&lt;br /&gt;-I tried using the shampoo only with my regular conditioner: my hair was again dirty, stiff and dull.&lt;br /&gt;-I tried using the conditioner only with my regular shampoo: my hair was very dry. However i decided to follow my normal routine to see the end result, which is: put on  Neutrogena triple moisture silk leave in cream, then blow dry, then straighten, the result was horrible, my hair look very dry and i had a very hard using the straightener since my hair wouldn&#x27;t glide, i looked like a scarecrow.&lt;br /&gt;- i also tried cleaning my scalp with my regular shampoo then applying some joico shampoo and follow with my regular conditioner like other people using this product commented online: this too was a disaster for me, not only does it add time to my shower routine, since supposedly you need to leave joico at least 3 mins. for it to work. The extra shampooing really irritated my scalp, i was scratching my head constantly. i stopped using joico, went back to my regulars and still i had the irritated scalp for about a week. i remembered when i first started getting highlights, my stylist recommended pureology(purple bottles). even though is an expensive product (about $60 for the 2 products), i just couldn&#x27;t stand the itching and i didn&#x27;t want to ruin my hairlights, so i bought it and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;So my conclusion with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t clean very well, it doesn&#x27;t condition very well, and the few times i used it, i didn&#x27;t notice any improvements/difference in the quality of my color, I WISH I HADN&#x27;T BOUGHT IT, is just sitting on my bathroom taking up space. if you plan on buying it buy a smaller bottle and try it you may have a better experience than i did.hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! It keeps the brassy tones out of my hair and smells great! I would recommend this to anybody with blond hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll try to make this short and sweet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get highlights, and you want them to be a whiter blonde instead of a yellowy/trumpet colored blond, buy this. Buy it right now. It takes highlights that are turning more golden into a nicer, ashier, shade. It works every single time I use it (about once a week), and it extends the life of my highlights for an extra month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s weird, and purple, and you have to clean it off your shower walls so it won&#x27;t stain, but MAN IS THIS WORTH THE MONEY!!!!! Plus, this is a great discounted deal, and the product comes nicely sealed up in the original packaging, which is a bonus... Trust me.</li>
    <li> Did the job as advertized.  Toned down the yellowish color buildup in my grey hair.</li>
    <li> this works quite well , keeping my hair soft and bright. I like it better than the old formula.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I asked for.</li>
    <li> Very good. Does wonders for blonde or gray hair. It removes the brassy tones and brightens your color, also leaves your hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I have blonde hair with lots of highlights and I love my hair WHITE blonde. I have used joico shampoo for quite sometime and my hairstylist says it makes SUCH a difference. It knocks all the brassines and yellowness of a blonde. But just be careful don&#x27;t use it everyday it is just meant for 2-3 times a week usage. It&#x27;s like using a professional shampoo on your hair but half the price!</li>
    <li> My hair is golden blonde with a range of cool to platinum highlights. When my highlights get too brassy I use this combo to restore what I&#x27;ve spent serious money at the salon creating. The problem is that both the shampoo and the conditioner damages my hair to the point that I can only use the product once a month. It takes weeks to deep condition my hair back to life and it&#x27;s just not worth it. I&#x27;ve tried just using the shampoo or just using the conditioner and the result is the same. For the record I&#x27;ve never let either the shampoo or conditioner sit in my hair. 30 seconds max with the shampoo and 1 minute max with the conditioner and a detangler/deep conditioner to follow. I&#x27;ll be looking for a different product. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with the nearly full bottles.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!  My daughter has color treated blonde hair.  It has always looked cheap and brassy.  Since she has been using this shampoo her hair looks natural blonde.  Even the in-grow of roots look better.  As long as her hair is blonde, she will be using this shampoo.  I never knew a shampoo &amp; conditioner could be so effective.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this Shampoo and Conditioner!!! Great for highlighted and blondes!!! Great Price!!! Receive it super fast!!!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased that it arrived early and the package was perfect.. I will be buying again</li>
    <li> Does wonders for blonde blonde hair. Takes the golden/brassy tones out. Could leave a light purple tint to your hair if you don&#x27;t get it all out or leave it on too long</li>
    <li> I received the wrong shampoo, great price but too scared to try and buy again and get wrong item again....</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that actually does what it says! Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it got such great reviews, but I was not impressed.  I only used it about 3 times a week and after every time I used it my hair felt like it still had product in it.  I rinsed my hair really really well and it still felt nasty.  After a couple weeks of this I gave up.  So now this shampoo and conditioner are sitting under my sink!</li>
    <li> I used an ash blonde color on my hair and still had brassy, slightly orange toned roots (I don&#x27;t double process)- so I picked up this shampoo and conditioner, hoping it would knock out the remaining reddish tones. It did the trick in a couple weeks, maybe a little TOO well. My hair wound up so ash-toned, that the color started to looked washed out against my skin. So I changed color.&lt;br /&gt;I changed my color to a medium golden brown, something darker that wouldn&#x27;t look as washed out against my skin. Normally my hair pulls red like crazy when it&#x27;s bleached, colored, etc. and seldom is it a pretty red, but more of a Bozo orange shade. I continued using the Joico with the new color, in hopes that it would prevent the orange shade I usually get with golden colors. It did the job beautifully! No sign of orange at all and the red highlights in my hair are a very true red in sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo did sting a bit the first few times I used it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, alternating days with a shampoo for colored hair. No more stinging and it keeps the yellow out out of my color so it&#x27;s never orange or brassy, just true, rich red highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other bluing shampoos in the past, like Clairol&#x27;s Silver lights and Pantene&#x27;s bluing shampoo for blonde or grey hair. They helped a little, but never truly knocked out all the yellow undertones like the Joico does. Love it and love my results!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend, she likes it and uses it, but it has a bit of a strange smell.  Not a terrible shampoo/conditioner and was a great price.</li>
    <li> Shampoo leaves your hair greasy even without using the conditioner and alot of rinsing! Will not buy this brand again! Clariol Shimmering Lights worked much better and the price was less.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this shampoo to maintain my blonde hair and I LOVE it! It has kept my hair blonde &amp; soft! There is no sign of brassyness at all. You do have to remember that it is a sulfate free shampoo so don&#x27;t expect suds &amp; theres noy much of a smell to it. It doesnt smell bad at all. My usual routine is to wash my hair with Joico Color Endure, leave it in for about 3 minutes &amp; I leave the conditioner for about 5 minutes before rinsing. I do this every 3-4 days. I literally don&#x27;t wash my hair often because I don&#x27;t want it to break &amp; that way my hair can produce enough oils. OH &amp; this shampoo will probably last me for about a year, they&#x27;re so big! ( I have a short bob lol)&lt;br /&gt;If you have any blonde on your hair I highly recommend this shampoo! I used to use the Sallys purple shampoo and it felt as if I was washing my hair with just water and it had seemed to have damaged it while I used it. Invest in a good shampoo blondies!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a violet shampoo and conditioner that is sulfate free because of my keratin treatment and highlights.  This fits the bill on both ends.  Very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and when it came it was NOT the violet shampoo and conditioner as shown in the picture and in the description of the product. It was the color endure but not the violet which is the entire reason I ordered this. I have blonde hair and need the violet shampoo. Complete waste of money and very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and find that my hair has taken on a slight lavender look, which I think is great.  No manic panic for me!</li>
