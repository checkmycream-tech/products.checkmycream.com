<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot durable scent..strong but not overpowering...my dad use to wear it and I knew it was him when he got to the house very unique smell ....</li>
    <li> Smells great lasts for a long time. I still smell it in my clothes after I have worn them.</li>
    <li> This is I think what people would call a love it or hate it. I cannot d we scribe the scent, but I think its gross. I wont be purchasing any more products for this manufacturer. Thats for sure... Gross...</li>
    <li> Great Spray for young and old man</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for the older perfumes</li>
    <li> Different. Showed up as a suggestion to my purchasing Quorum. Nope!  Not even close. Hubby wears when he works out in the yard not for fine dining.</li>
    <li> My husband smells great!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son. He has used it for around 20 years! It&#x27;s his favorite scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent, thought to be perfume as ...&lt;br /&gt;Ja had used some years ago, and had forgotten how much he has good smell.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived super fast, well packed and me and perfect!</li>
    <li> for something of this price range, the smell lasts. But the smell is not I am crazy about. Wont buy it again...</li>
    <li> This is one of Ted Lapidus famous fragrance. It stays long and the best for romantic wear. It&#x27;s best to use it on evenings and at night. No need to spray the whole bottle. And most of all be prepared to answer Lapidus when they ask you what you are wearing.</li>
    <li> Want something that smells delicious? Well This is it..don’t look any further, I can remember this fragrance back in the day and I haven’t seen it in a long time until I was shopping for the older colognes. I put this cologne up there with Obsession, Eternity and Polo…I love this stuff…they don’t make them like they use to but this one right here is a classic.</li>
    <li> I received the products and both of then when I went to use it the bottle were crack and the liquid spilled everywhere and also the smells is not the same, smells like old product, very strong and weird smells, I am not happy with this product at all..</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a fragrance, don&#x27;t look anywhere else. Ted Lapidus is timeless, classic and smell so so so good. It stays on for many days; it can even stay on your clothes for 1 month. You will not be disappointed at all; moreover, the ladies like it.</li>
    <li> I keep changing EDTs every now &amp; then. I&#x27;ve tried Jaipur by Boucheron, L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey by Issey Miyake, Obsession by Calvin Klein, Fahrenheit Asolute by Christian Dior etc to name a few. The one brand of EDT that I just keep coming back to, every time, is Lapidus by Ted Lapidus.    Lapidus EDT was introduced in the late 80s. I first used it around 1994 when I was a teenager. It was my first real EDT &amp; I&#x27;m still using it. It&#x27;s timeless, enigmatic &amp; sophisticated. It&#x27;s also the most value for money EDT I&#x27;ve ever used. Lack of fancy packaging &amp; bottling also contributes a lot to the low price. I used to pay as much as USD40 for a 3.3oz (100ml) bottle a while ago &amp; it&#x27;s now unbelievably priced at USD20 on Amazon. It&#x27;s getting increasingly hard to find in stores &amp; malls.    The sillage is consistent &amp; lingers for a long time. First notes are a lil&#x27; loud for my taste though. Heart notes are woody, spicy &amp; smoky. Base notes are sweet &amp; earthy. It lasts all day &amp; U can smell Lapidus on U&#x27;r clothes even after a month. Lol. This is my favorite EDT regardless of price &amp; I&#x27;ll surely stick with it for a long time to come.    EDTs are a matter of personal choice &amp; taste. One man&#x27;s good is another man&#x27;s bad. Buy&#x27;em only after U try&#x27;em.    Just my $0.02.    Brgds.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, good product, was exactly what I ordered, arrived on schedule with no problems and works perfectly, thanks</li>
    <li> A nice fragrance.  You won&#x27;t meet many people wearing the same thing; however, bear in mind that it is extremely spicy and loud.  Some people might really be too timid to wear this.  See the basenotes.net reviews if you want more commentary about the fragrance. Otherwise, it arrived promptly, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, among the top best in the market. It stays on your cloth all day long, i highly recommend it to people.</li>
    <li> This stuff lasts all day and most importantly smells good.  An oldie but a goodie.  I would recommend it.  Don&#x27;t fall for the overpriced colognes.  No cologne will get you a woman: it can only smell good and last long, so this does both at a great price!</li>
    <li> This has become my new favorite cologne, and it is from the 80&#x27;s !! This is a good scent for all seasons, hot summers and cold winters. You don&#x27;t need to put on a lot because Lapidus has a solid scent that will last all day. I think this fragrance is perfect because it is not a sweet scent and it is not too musky, it has a \\&quot;LAID-BACK FRESHNESS\\&quot; about it that is so addicting. I have gotten quite a few compliments on this fragrance at work. 5 star fragrance !!</li>
    <li> I first bought Ted Lapidus 20 years ago when visiting San Francisco and I have still never found a perfume as unique and enjoyable. There is none like it. It is too strong a fragrance for summer and I only wear it in winter, but it is the only fragrance I know that stays on you all day. Yes, you only need a little otherwise it can overwhelm, and be assured it will stay with you all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone but I always get comments about it and my wife adores it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> not sure just how old this stuff is but i&#x27;m 20 and its more like for my 60 year old dad. strong distrubing smell i like something clean and fresh. 3 stars though, it could be worse</li>
    <li> Excellent product i highly recommend very good.i loved it. What we wanted. Very good everything I expected. comprenlo - guaranteed.</li>
    <li> The first impression is little too strong for me, but once it dries on your clothes it&#x27;s very pleasant. It lasts long and you can easily smell it on your clothes a good couple of weeks after hanging them in the closet for a couple of weeks. My wife loves it. Stop paying $40-50 for the well known colognes and try this one. You won&#x27;t be disappointment.</li>
    <li> This Eau De Toilette is good for morning time , the fragrance last all day . Merci Monsieur Lapidus.  I will keep wearing your product _ I started 30 years&#x60; ago _</li>
    <li> This Perfumes Is Old But Is Very Good I Recommend Is Cheap and Smell Excellent</li>
    <li> Finding the Lapidus by Ted Lapidus Eau De Toilette Spray has become increasingly difficult since local providers no longer have this product.  It was with delight that I found it on Amazon and was able to present it as a welcomed birthday gift to my best friend!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Lapidus Pour Homme and was thoroughly disappointed. The formulation must have changed in the years since I last bought it. The fragrance is not as rich and it fades very quickly. My disclaimer is that maybe my sense of smell might have changed, but I don&#x27;t think it would have changed that dramatically. It might be a knock off, though I wouldn&#x27;t have any idea how, the time, or desire to pursue that. I feel it is one of the hazards of remote commerce. The service and delivery were excellent.</li>
    <li> Some 15 years ago I was introduced to this cologne... I&#x27;ve been a Fan ever since !! A Many Compliments</li>
    <li> I bought this item a week ago and when i got it the letters are almost faded away completely. I&#x27;m wondering if this is a fake version , to me it looks like it anyone has the same issue here ??.</li>
    <li> This is cheap and very. Good perfume. ...it last all day. Is fresh and women love it...i have more than 15 years using it.....highly recomend..</li>
    <li> exelente 100% original</li>
    <li> It is really strong!!! Almost as strong as &amp;#34;One Man Show&amp;#34; if not in the same magnitude. However, I really don&#x27;t care about the scent, it has nothing special about it. Now I only use it when I want to hit the gym because I know I will be all sweaty. At least I will be sweaty but not smelly, LOL.</li>
    <li> Starts off pretty brash and loud, but the dry down is good and lasts very long. One or two sprays max will do or you may project this one half a mile away. Good scent for the price. I like it but don&#x27;t reach for this often as I have ones that I like more than this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good fragrence. I&#x27;ve only worn it once but it is very noticable.</li>
    <li> I bought this item on a review of great smells.........To me, it is a good smell....not &amp;#34;Great&amp;#34;....but that is for me...</li>
    <li> 4/23 This was a blind buy for me and I can&#x27;t say I love it, but I am not even that sure yet.  I sprayed it into the air once about 2 hours ago, and I still taste it.  That&#x27;s right folks, it is one of those scents that when it hits the air it just overtakes everything.  The whole house smells like it from just one spray.  I will have to think about this one for a bit.  Right now it is just a much stronger fragrance than I am use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/24 I have thought about it, and I can say with certainty, I am not a fan.  It almost reminds me of Boucheron for men or even Charles Jourdan for men.  I am not a fan of either.  I am more of a Gucci by Gucci for men kind of guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like strong confusing scents this is a good one for you, If you prefer something a little more mild, look for something other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/25 Okay so I braved up and tried it again, and now I think I like it.  A very confusing scent indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This review is not intended to persuaded or dissuade anyone from purchasing this product, it is only a personal opinion.</li>
    <li> Lapidus makes many different ones, this is I think one of his better ones, smell is great stay&#x27;s a long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent. thank you very much</li>
    <li> The smell is intoxicating and command attention. I got it from amazon.com; even though it came in an unsealed box, I kept it because I like it that much.</li>
    <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong Amazon has always made me free and better; acquires another company uses Amazon are excellent, Amazon is always an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance, for example, I love the way all I can even give gende and love and is also author of Through Amazon, as well as any product I buy, is truly exquisite.</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for years, it seems very good and if presentation, however, note that the durability of the fragrance was not the same anymore.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for many, many years.   Great price from Amazon for a first-class product.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet then do so - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> thanks for the product all this fine see you later</li>
    <li> ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION, YOU RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> it is ok. It smells like jack bogart pour homme.</li>
    <li> Great scent with good price and fast ship with Prime.</li>
    <li> This is not the original scent from back in the day please stop changing the fragrances</li>
    <li> good product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> bought this for my brother as a gift he loved it. very strong lasting scent but not over powering even after washing you can still smell it on the clothes. would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> the best ,the best ,the best perfume,love it Ted Lapidus, very durable men&#x27;s fragrance.From the category of fragrance &amp;#34;Must have&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Excellent quick delivery recommend Perfume buy again soon thanks</li>
    <li> Received this cologne about a month ago-it has a nice, pleasant smell to it and it lasts a very long time. I sprayed it on my pillow case on fri--when I returned home on sunday, it still lingered on my pillow. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> It smells old and musty, not at all like the same one we had before. Plus, I can not return it, I won&#x27;t use them again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne. It relly is one of my personal favorites. Also, the price on here is FAR better than at any boutique or store I&#x27;ve have been to.</li>
    <li> Loved it!!!!!! Everything about it was excellent.  The delivery time and the freshness of the product was excellent. And the price can&#x27;t be Beat!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Powerful projection. Old school scent that lasts the whole day. the whole whole day. Only for the brave. If you like subtlety this is not your perfume. It announces your presence.</li>
    <li> Glad that it was less than $20.  This may be for some people - not me. Kept waiting for something to happen during a dry down... &amp;#34;Scrubber&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Exelent and very good item. Exelent transaction</li>
    <li> This fragrance is sweet and reminds me of the rich fragrance that is made by all the women mingling together on a cruise ship formal night.</li>
    <li> thank you very much i love this product i recommended a 100% to everyone, its very good and you can buy.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A CLASSIC PERFUMS FROM THE 80´S BY TED LAPIDUS.  EXCELLENT PERFUM, EXCELLENT PRICE,I ALWAYS BOUGHT IT BECAUSE A CLASSIC EVER WILL BE A CLASSIC</li>
    <li> I like this scent very much, it different than what I am used to. It seems to not last as long as everyone says but it does make it all day at work.</li>
    <li> Is a good cologne for the price I paid I am very satisfied. I recomend this product is good so far.</li>
    <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Unique and women who smell it ask the name always.</li>
    <li> excellent product, excellent seller, recommend</li>
    <li> Smells like Ben Gay meets Old Spice.......</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell of it too flowery for my taste it smells like some cheap imitations i&#x27;ve sampeled in the far east quite a disapointment .</li>
    <li> Back in the late 80s I loved this cologne. After not wearing it for over two decades I decided to see if I still liked it. I ordered it....received it...and found out I still love it! The smell is intoxicating. I put on in the mornings and I can still smell some when I get home in the evenings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad...the box the bottle was  in was tore on the top where you open it. So, I don&#x27;t know if I purchased a returned or sample product.</li>
    <li> Great smell, masculine ... And you can not beat the price! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The sillage on this product is so good that a whole day later I can still smell it. My wife and sister in law love this cologne and once again for the price this is truly a impact performer that keeps you smelling fresh. I had never heard of this product before but when old school folks can hip you to the game of fragrance you will most certainly disembark on the trail of axe body spray and set a trend that is truly your own. This too is a classic!</li>
    <li> I really love this pedi 2 for gifts and get well looked fast and I love I will continue buying perfumer</li>
    <li> This perfume is really good!!!..years ago my brother gave me one for my birthday and from then on i have kept buying it.</li>
    <li> thanks for the product if fulfilled my expectations and is actually as shown in the picture. and looks good quality</li>
    <li> is a good perfume, so a good product, nice price and well the essence of my father&#x27;s favorite. thanks Again.</li>
    <li> Very strong and lasting scent. Use sparingly, I bought it upon reading reviews. Do not know if I would buy it again, but I am glad I tried it..</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t last whole day but may be good for small evening gathering.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way. Wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering online as i couldn&#x27;t smell it ahead of time but it was exactly what i expected. Same quality as major stores.</li>
    <li> The cologne it self smells good but this is very subjective so it is kind of a hit or a miss if you are planning to blind buy this. I am not happy for the packaging. When I opened the delivery box, I found the bottle to be half way out of the cologne box. I was clearly opened and did not have any form of seal on it. So I cannot tell if it is the original because it is already opened and this cologne has been around for almost 3 decades. Other than that, the time they took to deliver this was good. It came earlier than I expected.</li>
    <li> 1st bottle I got had a broken sprayer and a suspicious bottle.  Plus, the fragrance was all wrong. However, I contacted Amazon and got a replacement immediately.  The replacement was right. This is my favorite fragrance, and that of everyone around me.  I have worn it for over 25 years and it never gets dated.</li>
    <li> Like the aroma . Plan to order again</li>
    <li> Im smelling good,jajaja</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of this cologne. I can&#x27;t find it in stores, and after I moved fro out of south Florida I could only find it online. Amazon had the best price offer. So I&#x27;ve bought it multiple times.</li>
    <li> I just love the smell. I been looking for this product long time I am glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> i loved the cologne .i used it for more than 10 years .your service is excellent .the cologne got to me sooner than expected .thanks for your service .looking forward to ordering more cologne.from you</li>

    <li> Fue el mismo producto que encargue y llego en perfectas condiciones.Gracias. todo muy bien, estoy contenta con mi producto. Gracias</li>
    <li> This scent smells like baby powder and something else. The something else is why I like it. I can&#x27;t pinpoint the something else, but it&#x27;s very unique, sweet, sophisticated and sexy. Despite being an 80s scent, there&#x27;s something futuristic about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the sillage and uniqueness of this scent, I find it a bargain. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars is because I had an imitation Lapidus that smelled better. The imitation had more of the something else and less baby powder, however, only smelled good for about two hours then the scent was completely gone. I was a little disappointed by how powdery it is, yet still a nice scent at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for a while and I get alot of compliments on it and for under $20 its really worth it.</li>
    <li> This item I bought for my brother-in-law back in our country. It smells good but way too strong for me. I forbade my husband from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was that the bottle was leaking. Maybe this is why it was too strong for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called amazon and they are sending a new bottle in the mail.</li>
    <li> Awful!!!!!! Smells like something that your great grandma would use. Very flowery. Not a mans scent. Total wate of money. Cannot stand the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money. I cannot imagine anyone wearing this. Its overpowering and will give you a headache. Made my dogs sneeze.</li>
    <li> Out of all the colognes I&#x27;ve bought My hubby over the years this is one of My favorites. Smells good in the bottle but even better on him. This is a cologne I bought him for years when I could buy it locally (at JCPenney, until they discontinued it), so glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a masculine scent, certainly, but I would argue one without the usual overt edge. More of a wafting character to it. It&#x27;s strong, but strong in a cloudy, abtuse way; it doesn&#x27;t cut you in the nose. It smells at once like grape-ish chalk, Old Spice-scented bowling alley hand soap, and the effect wintergreen would have on your nose--the after remnants of the vaguest tingle of wintergreen. One 3-star reviewer noted that Lapidus is \\&quot;old.\\&quot; Agreed, thoroughly. \\&quot;Aged\\&quot; might even be more accurate. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad, though, it&#x27;s just a different smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up this pour homme is an alright, reliably strong fragrance. To my nose it draws up the notion of small-town dependability mixed with James Patterson novels. I would not recommend it for city folk or intellectuals whatsoever.</li>
