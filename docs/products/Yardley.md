      <li>Love* Yardley violets!  </li>
      <li>Better smelling than I recalled it to be through the mists of my olafactory memory!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>However, I have always liked violet water since I received some from my aunt and uncle who lived in England when I was a child.</li>
      <li>Thrilled to find it, buy it and wear it.  </li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>This is the closest and nice I could buy in the U.S.. reminds me of my childhood.</li>
      <li>would like to spray this on my husband to see if it works better on someone warm and oily.</li>
      <li>I just loved the sweet smell of violets.</li>
      <li>This is a classic light scent that is perfect for summer, the office, or travelling.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately,when it was finished ,I couldn&#x27;t get any more and was told Yardly had stopped making it.</li>
      <li>It smells just like most violets.</li>
      <li>Have not been able to find this here in stores forever.</li>
      <li>I love this scent and could not find it anywhere.</li>
      <li>I love violets &amp; remember someone in my family wore it all the time.  </li>
      <li>Violet is a favorite scent of mine.  </li>
      <li>Fell in love with this as a child and thought I&#x27;d never find it again.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found it</li>
      <li>The reasons for loving perfumes are many, but my primary reason for delight in April</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume, and I hope that someday Yardley will produce it again.</li>
      <li>I truly love the scent.</li>
      <li>Imagine my delight when I found it on your web-site and was able to order it again.</li>
      <li>I love this toilette spray because when spring is in the Air I like to wear my parfum according to the seasons and violets means spring to</li>
      <li>It was just ok.</li>
      <li>Its okay.</li>
      <li>I always used this lovely perfume (and soap) in England and brought some with me,</li>
      <li>I was all set to fall in love.</li>
      <li>This smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>While it does smell quite good, I don&#x27;t think it smells exactly like what we had as children.</li>
      <li>A beautiful, clean, classy scent!!!</li>
      <li>I am sure you will enjoy this one.</li>
      <li>I know the spots where they grow locally and always seek them out on my dog walks to enjoy the incredible scent.  </li>
      <li>Smells like strong candied violets with baby powder undertones.</li>
      <li>Now I can enjoy it all year</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice but not what I really wanted.</li>
      <li>I am so happy to find it back on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It leaves me smelling very fresh without feeling overdone.</li>
      <li>Very nice; soft, sweet, and pretty</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rather a one-note fragrance, but that note is lovely -- a very Victorian, but not \\&quot;old-ladyish,\\&quot; violet scent.</li>
      <li>Really miss the sweet smell of violas!</li>
      <li>Soft, sexy, and feminine...  </li>
      <li>An all-time favorite that I will NEVER grow old of.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is certainly not Amazon&#x27;s doing, but Amazon needs to make good on my purchase.</li>
      <li>It was a small bottle and smelled just like the violets I had picked from Great Grandmothers yard as a child.</li>
      <li>Which, while not a bad scent per se, made me feel very self-conscious.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I asked for and received it as a birthday present last month, and I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I know that buying a fragrance you have never smelled before can be risky, but with a single floral you should be pretty safe; I was not disappointed in any of my 3 purchases.  </li>
      <li>but like it very much</li>
      <li>It reminds of spring, clothes on the line, fresh clean sheets, being young again.  </li>
      <li>The first whiff did not disappoint, being a juicy burst of violet and grape jelly.</li>
      <li>It brought back so many memories.</li>
      <li>It is reminiscent of the violet water I used to love.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells pretty</li>
      <li>Does not last more than 1 hour.</li>
      <li>I had to order this twice last year to get a bottle with that old favorite sweet smell.</li>
      <li>While the wait for this perfume to arrive was a long one, it was clearly worthwhile as the fragrance is heavenly.</li>
      <li>pleasant, delicate aroma</li>
      <li>I want as pure of a violet sent as I can find.</li>
      <li>it used to be that anything two hours drive or less was &amp;#34;local&amp;#34;) I am buying more things online and having fun discovering new products.</li>
      <li>fast delivery.</li>
      <li>At one point I was having to order overseas from England and be very patient on delivery.</li>
      <li>I really wanted the &#x27;60&#x27;s Yardley cologn e called &amp;#34;Eau de London&amp;#34; but can&#x27;t find it</li>
      <li>there is something about the scent of violets that I find very soothing.</li>
      <li>This classic fragrance is gorgeous and smells much more expensive!</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something decent.</li>
      <li>make no secret over my dissatisfaction with the fragrances available at the local chain drugstores and big box stores.  </li>
      <li>you are looking for a soft, very feminine scent  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t normally gravitate toward perfumes or eau de cologne.</li>
      <li>love,love love it, just what I was hoping it was the only perfume, I wore for a long time</li>
      <li>This smells just like the tiny sweet violets that grow wild and bloom early in the springtime.  </li>
      <li>I am from Hungary and I live in California.</li>
      <li>I was EXTREMELY excited to receive this, since the only perfumes I like at the moment are blue or purple soliflores.</li>
      <li>but I like the old fashion fragrances.</li>
      <li>Call me old fashioned</li>
      <li>It is subtle yet sweet as well as refreshing while not being heavy and overpowering.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very surprise to find an Eau de toilette of this quality at such of low price.</li>
      <li>After this, I went about my day, only to be sporadically surprised by the smell of grandmothers wafting through the room.</li>
      <li>Was everything I expected and the order was processed very promptly.</li>
      <li>Wil be ordering more before it becomes extinct.</li>
      <li>However, now that I have instituted my new shop locally policy (anything I have to cross a county line for is no longer local......</li>
      <li>I from this seller, however the other sellers were very overpriced, so I will definitely NOT buy from them!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> fast delivery. no problems. Smells like strong candied violets with baby powder undertones. My husband loves it on me. Great value. a little goes a long way and tends to last longer than expected for an economically priced perfume.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, and I hope that someday Yardley will produce it again. I use it in my linen closet, when I&#x27;m changing the sheets, and just to spritz on myself for a pick-me-up</li>
    <li> Smells very different than it use to smell like, another fragance thats been revive and the formula change, I am sorry when they do that. Also after a few minutes doesnt smell anymore.</li>
    <li> I was EXTREMELY excited to receive this, since the only perfumes I like at the moment are blue or purple soliflores. And they must be named after a flower, not a concept like &amp;#34;City Nights,&amp;#34; and especially NOT a celebrity since the idea of spritzing another woman&#x27;s essence all over my body temple is horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was all set to fall in love. The first whiff did not disappoint, being a juicy burst of violet and grape jelly. This was followed by a bitter and biological note that was disturbing but short lived. After this, I went about my day, only to be sporadically surprised by the smell of grandmothers wafting through the room. Not a comforting nostalgic smell, but the smell of a dead bodies covered in perfumed powder trying to kiss you on the cheek. It made me feel afraid. Finally, this dramatic phase passed and settled into the smell of scented toilet paper. Which, while not a bad scent per se, made me feel very self-conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to spray this on my husband to see if it works better on someone warm and oily.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Amazon - what is going on? I had to order this twice last year to get a bottle with that old favorite sweet smell. I just now received my SECOND bottle. Different packaging and the smell is absolutely disgusting. I&#x27;m not trying a third bottle. Very frustrating.   An all-time favorite that I will NEVER grow old of. In fact, I wish they had this on auto-ship. I grew up with this scent as it was a fragrance my mother wore. Yes, it reminds me of her. I truly love the scent. And through all of the years that I continue to wear this spray, people continue to stop me and ask me what I am wearing. For a period of time this scent had been discontinued. Oddly enough, April Violets still remains a product you cannot find in any store. I am so happy to find it back on Amazon. At one point I was having to order overseas from England and be very patient on delivery.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a violet fragrance, but this one is just right. Reminds you of springtime with every spray.</li>
    <li> love,love love it, just what I was hoping it was the only perfume, I wore for a long time and I&#x27;m glad I found it</li>
    <li> pleasant, delicate aroma</li>
    <li> This smells pretty good. It smells just like most violets. It&#x27;s not very strong. I usually spray it on twice in one day. But, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> Was everything I expected and the order was processed very promptly.</li>
    <li> I really wanted the &#x27;60&#x27;s Yardley cologn e called &amp;#34;Eau de London&amp;#34; but can&#x27;t find it so I went with this. It&#x27;s nice but not what I really wanted.</li>
    <li> I love it! Soft, sexy, and feminine...  I&#x27;m very surprise to find an Eau de toilette of this quality at such of low price.</li>
    <li> I love violets &amp; remember someone in my family wore it all the time.  For years I looked for it  &amp; never found it until I was online looking for something else.  This is perfect after a good soak in the tub or shower.  It reminds of spring, clothes on the line, fresh clean sheets, being young again.  Or just want that spring scent.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I like this perfume, it has a pleasant violet scent, it does fades to a softer note though but like it very much</li>
    <li> Takes me back to my youth. This fragrance is so very similar to &amp;#34;Devon violets&amp;#34; it takes me back to the 70&#x27;s with fond remembrance.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a soft, very feminine scent  I am sure you will enjoy this one.</li>
    <li> It did not have the same fragrance s when it was purple, sounds crazy, but true.  It was just ok.</li>
    <li> Its okay. Does not last more than 1 hour. I would not buy this again. Thank you</li>
    <li> Smells great. Gave it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I always used this lovely perfume (and soap) in England and brought some with me, Unfortunately,when it was finished ,I couldn&#x27;t get any more and was told Yardly had stopped making it. Imagine my delight when I found it on your web-site and was able to order it again. It smells wonder ful and makes me happy, MLL.</li>
    <li> The reasons for loving perfumes are many, but my primary reason for delight in April Violets is that it renews my memories of a very lovely woman who used it all the time.  She  and her husband were friends of my parents.  When she visited and they used the guest room, I used to go in and sniff the pillows after they left!  Delivery of this spray was prompt, and I&#x27;ve been using it for some time now; my husband likes it too!</li>
    <li> This is a terrible smell. I hate it.  I was hoping for something decent.</li>
    <li> Seller is great met all expectations. Product is quality. Wil be ordering more before it becomes extinct. Only wush seller had the april violets lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a joke. Not only is it NOT real violets (so far as I&#x27;m concerned), it stinks. I could smell it regardless that I could not open the spray trigger. Moreover, THEY (I bought two) CANNOT BE RETURNED. OH, YEAH? That was not told to us at the site. What gives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly not Amazon&#x27;s doing, but Amazon needs to make good on my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  It is a fragrance I remember my mother wearing when I was a child, and it is not easy to get anymore.  I was happy with the price, the delivery time, and the product itself.  I will definitely get this again I from this seller, however the other sellers were very overpriced, so I will definitely NOT buy from them!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction, very happy! AAAAA+</li>
    <li> Have not been able to find this here in stores forever. Still smells wonderful. Came quicker than I thought it would. Just wonderful product and service.</li>
    <li> I just loved the sweet smell of violets. It brought back so many memories. I am introducing the fragrance to my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Smells so violetty, just like I remember. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Violet is a favorite scent of mine.  I was always looking for a violet similar to the Violet Water made by Crabtree and Evelyn in the 1990&#x27;s.  This is the closest I could find that was not also expensive.  I asked for and received it as a birthday present last month, and I&#x27;m happy with it.  It&#x27;s rather a one-note fragrance, but that note is lovely -- a very Victorian, but not \\&quot;old-ladyish,\\&quot; violet scent.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with this as a child and thought I&#x27;d never find it again.  Thrilled to find it, buy it and wear it.  Heavenly!  Delicious!  One of the few joys of my childhood that lives up to the memory.  And it&#x27;s not fattening!</li>
    <li> I am not really into scent so I don&#x27;t normally gravitate toward perfumes or eau de cologne. However, I have always liked violet water since I received some from my aunt and uncle who lived in England when I was a child. I discovered this product some time ago. It is reminiscent of the violet water I used to love. It is subtle yet sweet as well as refreshing while not being heavy and overpowering. It leaves me smelling very fresh without feeling overdone.</li>
    <li> This is the third of the three single note florals I purchased through Amazon.  I know that buying a fragrance you have never smelled before can be risky, but with a single floral you should be pretty safe; I was not disappointed in any of my 3 purchases.  This smells just like the tiny sweet violets that grow wild and bloom early in the springtime.  I know the spots where they grow locally and always seek them out on my dog walks to enjoy the incredible scent.  Now I can enjoy it all year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make no secret over my dissatisfaction with the fragrances available at the local chain drugstores and big box stores.  I live in a small town in a rural area and I am two hours away from the nearest Sephora store, so my purchasing options for fragrances are extremely limited.  I don&#x27;t care how good the stuff in the bottle smells, if it has a name like Kim Kardashian or Britney Spears on it........there is no way in hell I will buy it.  I am also not fond the the lineup of designer knock-off fragrances.  I miss the days of going down to the drugstore and finding name brand perfumes on the shelf; I even miss the fragrances offered by the perfume manufacturers (remember Coty, Jovan, Prince Matchabelli, etc).  However, now that I have instituted my new shop locally policy (anything I have to cross a county line for is no longer local......it used to be that anything two hours drive or less was &amp;#34;local&amp;#34;) I am buying more things online and having fun discovering new products.</li>
    <li> Very nice; soft, sweet, and pretty</li>
    <li> This is the closest scent to violets i have ever found! Amazing! I am from Hungary and I live in California. Really miss the sweet smell of violas! (ibolya) Now when I get home sick, I just take a sniff:)</li>
    <li> *Love* Yardley violets!  This is a classic light scent that is perfect for summer, the office, or travelling.  I like to wear it when I go to bed too... there is something about the scent of violets that I find very soothing.</li>
    <li> Not a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> While the wait for this perfume to arrive was a long one, it was clearly worthwhile as the fragrance is heavenly. Better smelling than I recalled it to be through the mists of my olafactory memory! I was thrilled to recieve it and will use it sparingly so that the joy of its fragrance remains available to me for a good time to come!</li>
    <li> I love this toilette spray because when spring is in the Air I like to wear my parfum according to the seasons and violets means spring to me.&lt;br /&gt;My sister calls me the Seasons lady. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells pretty</li>
    <li> I like the smell of violets. I use a perfume that I buy in Spain &amp;#34;violet&amp;#34; from Alvarez Gomez. This is the closest and nice I could buy in the U.S.. reminds me of my childhood. Very, very good</li>
    <li> I love this scent and could not find it anywhere.</li>
    <li> This classic fragrance is gorgeous and smells much more expensive! I get compliments whenever I wear it. A beautiful, clean, classy scent!!!</li>
    <li> I used this as a child and decided to order.  While it does smell quite good, I don&#x27;t think it smells exactly like what we had as children.</li>
    <li> I do like this fragrance but it was not what I was hoping for. I was looking for a stronger violet note then this has. I want as pure of a violet sent as I can find. I found one years ago in a shop. It was a small bottle and smelled just like the violets I had picked from Great Grandmothers yard as a child. Call me old fashioned but I like the old fashion fragrances.</li>
