### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I test out a variety of conditioners to see what I can find to be the best balance.</li>
      <li>So I want to do my very best to care for my hair as thoroughly as I can.</li>
      <li>this helps - good luck with your hair product of choice!</li>
      <li>My hair drinks that stuff happily</li>
      <li>It smelled great</li>
      <li>i figured something that was good for the environment would be great.</li>
      <li>AND if I&#x27;m having a good hair day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not picky, I just want my hair to smell good.</li>
      <li>I have bleached hair that needs a good moisturizing and repairing conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I bought this mostly because it smells great.</li>
      <li>That is, while I want to keep the earth happy, I also want my hair to be healthy.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and my hair feels very nice after using it.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;garniers smelled more pleasant, and i had to use quite a lot, Twice, in order for the hair to be smoothened out when rinsing it.</li>
      <li>I want, every day, for the hair to be as perfect and tangle free and easy to brush as I can get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I saw this product, I was enthusiastic to try it...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I ended up contacting Garnier, and the customer service was nice and sent me coupons to replace my shampoo with another garnier product.</li>
      <li>Im one of those people who can use almost any kind of shampoo and conditioner with no problems.</li>
      <li>It honestly feels like shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love this product and love the way it smells!</li>
      <li>After using this for a month, I think this conditioner is totally fine!</li>
      <li>I will gladly pay a bit more to use products that are biodegradable and more earth-friendly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to do with the rest of the bottle, because I&#x27;m sure not going to use it.</li>
      <li>Because it tangles, I need to brush, but as as soon as I brush, my hairs stand up because of the static.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I was testing this after a set of Suave testing and certainly it&#x27;s better than the Suave level of products.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m buying some more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this as a conditioning treatment, leaving it in my hair for some 20 minutes before rinsing out completely, and the detangling and softening effectsare good!</li>
      <li>This conditioner is really light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, smells great, and makes my hair feel great.</li>
      <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is fine.</li>
      <li>Fine by me.</li>
      <li>Actually, the ends of my hair are quite happy and my hair is clean and light!</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair so smooth it tricks you into thinking \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; until you realize how quickly your hair dries and viola!</li>
      <li>kind and am much happier with the results.</li>
      <li>The aroma is fantastic too.  </li>
      <li>If your health isn&#x27;t as important as your time this isn&#x27;t your conditioner.</li>
      <li>So I was thrilled when I saw the Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Shampoo and Conditioner set.</li>
      <li>this product is environmentally friendly - that&#x27;s always a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I was excited about it being \\&quot;natural.\\</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells a little better, but used together is a smell happy result</li>
      <li>I just need it to clean my hair</li>
      <li>, the hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it should when I&#x27;m done.</li>
      <li>Clean used together has worked wonders for me...</li>
      <li>It behaves itself, smells nice, and feels wonderfully soft, but it looks greasy, so I either have to hide it by pulling it up</li>
      <li>Also, the smell, which is really nice, is strong and stays in for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more is that my hair never feels clean and is always limp and filled with static.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great start for green products because the bottle is recyclable and the product is biodegradable, but it still needs a lot of improvement on quality.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this line of products and do not be roped into the environmentally friendly bit like I was, there are plenty of environmentally responsible shampoos/conditioners out there that work</li>
      <li>The only positive of this product is that it smells nice.  </li>
      <li>I bought this despite all the bad reviews after reading the good reviews, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>With most conditioners I can gently move the hair around and the conditioner gets to all the hairs naturally.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and have been using natural, silicone free products for years.</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty finicky and it takes some searching to get a product that works.</li>
      <li>I first tried this when I showered at a friend&#x27;s place.</li>
      <li>I adore supporting products that keep our planet cleaner.</li>
      <li>I too, thought at first I hadn&#x27;t rinsed all the conditioner out</li>
      <li>/&gt;I ended up using this s/c for a week or more, trying different combos... even mixing the conditioner in with the shampoo to hopefully cut the grease while still conditioning.</li>
      <li>It pretty much does nothing</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t oily, but more like wax, which was very strange.</li>
      <li>More noticeable than normal conditioning, which would total something like 7 minutes at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling dry, and I find i have to use twice as much just to be able to get my fingers through my hair at all.</li>
      <li>First day without it was fine, but since then my hair has been flat, tangled, and gets very static-y.</li>
      <li>&quot; I&#x27;m making for charity purposes, I&#x27;m just not willing to sacrifice it with this product, especially when there are so many other better options out there.ot sure about this 92% biodegradable claim.</li>
      <li>So, shampoo first, rinse clean, massage in conditioner, continue with the rest of your shower and rinse this out last.</li>
      <li>I put vinegar into the bottle and don&#x27;t use a dedicated shampoo product; I instead clean my scalp with this, rinse clean, and then apply it to the rest of my hair while I do all other shower things.</li>
      <li>I want as much hair as possible to be available for the charity.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really feel like it did anything.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After 2 days, with this product, my hair REALLY needs a wash.</li>
      <li>This conditioner treats my whole head evenly and consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And I have perfectly straight medium thickness hair- the easiest hair on earth.  </li>
      <li>I have smooth, silky, Asian hair, and after using the conditioner, my hair just feels dirtier.  </li>
      <li>Great idea and concept, but poor execution by Garnier.</li>
      <li>Use less, rinse very well and see if it&#x27;s better;).</li>
      <li>He came back with Pure Clean</li>
      <li>I had been using Yes To Carrots for a while and saw the Garnier Fructis Pure Clean conditioner on sale at my local supermarket and decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>After my local store ran out of the Triple Nutrition shampoo and conditioner, I bought the Pure Clean ones as a replacement.</li>
      <li>It takes a bit longer to rinse out because it is lacking the chemicals other conditioners have to assist in a quick clean rinse \\&quot;silicon\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I liked that it had very little</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used some other normal Garnier conditioner for most of the 2014-15 fall to spring months and have used the company&#x27;s products before, and this is nothing worse than I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner, I have straight dark brown hair</li>
      <li>Everytime I use it, I curse myself for not throwing it away after the first try and not buying my old Garnier.</li>
      <li>Well, Garnier pure clean left my hair soft, stronger and no tangles...easily combing it.  </li>
      <li>A lot of silicone free conditioners will not give your hair the same silky smooth feeling that you may get with other products, but I am used to (and expect) that.</li>
      <li>stuff seems thinner, less viscous than most conditioners, so it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also more manageable, less frizzy, and easier to detangle after I&#x27;ve used this conditioner.</li>
      <li>not sure why this has so many negative reviews, but my experience has been a good one.</li>
      <li>no silicones even better since I already use a styling mousse with a little bit of silicone in it.  </li>
      <li>and I thought it would, at the very least, be as good as any run of the mill conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair is very thick and usually very wavy with a good deal of natural shine and body to it</li>
      <li>&quot; I&#x27;m making for charity purposes, I&#x27;m just not willing to sacrifice it with this product, especially when there are so many other better options out there.</li>
      <li>, Disney is having it star in a sequel opposite my fresh out of my jeans pocket earphones.</li>
      <li>I purchased this conditioner as a substitute for my normal conditioner, which was out of stock.</li>
      <li>I have extremely thick hair and a good balance - not dry, not oily.&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want THREE new Garnier products, and I don&#x27;t want to have to pay a cent for a replacement.</li>
      <li>Not to mention I let my hair air dry to avoid undo damage, and this took by no exaggeration about 4 times longer to dry than if I had used a more normal shampoo.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the clarifying Pure Clean shampoo and one of the anti-dandruff Pure Clean shampoos, and they simply do what they say they will, with a bit less perfume than some other shampoos in the same price range.</li>
      <li>Many other products, for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair would either dry my hair out or make it oily.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste money on this product.</li>
      <li>The first time I used the s/c set, I noticed that my hair took forever to dry</li>
      <li>Silicon creates a water tight seal on your pores, so your hair never actually gets conditioned, leaving your hair famished but smooth.</li>
      <li>Last night I went to the store and saw this new shine spray they have for about $6.50, so I figured I would buy it with my 3 coupons.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After my local store ran out of the Triple Nutrition shampoo and conditioner, I bought the Pure Clean ones as a replacement. Biggest mistake ever. The shampoo has dried out my hair and scalp so badly that I&#x27;ve suddenly had an outbreak of dandruff and hair breakage, and the conditioner leaves a horrible waxy build up that actually leaves wads of soft wax on various places of my body when being rinsed out of my hair. It&#x27;s disgusting. What&#x27;s more is that my hair never feels clean and is always limp and filled with static.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair and a good balance - not dry, not oily.&lt;br /&gt;Pure Clean used together has worked wonders for me... Many other products, for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair would either dry my hair out or make it oily.  The conditioner is very creamy, but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave any residue.  The aroma is fantastic too.  The shampoo smells a little better, but used together is a smell happy result</li>
    <li> I have the entire line of Garnier Fructis sleek and shine products and have had no complaints. When I ran out of conditioner, I told my husband to pick up a Garner conditioner when he was at the store. He came back with Pure Clean and I thought it would, at the very least, be as good as any run of the mill conditioner. From the first time I used it, my hair didn&#x27;t feel conditioned (couldn&#x27;t run my hands through my hair in the shower), it left a heavy film that made my thick hair look and feel desperately limp and oily, and lastly, when I went to use any styling creams or sprays, my hair turned into a waxy, flat disaster. I too, thought at first I hadn&#x27;t rinsed all the conditioner out.. I&#x27;ve used this conditioner out of necessity for the last two weeks and my ends have never looked worse (very dry and frizzy). At this point, I&#x27;m just putting my hair in a ponytail until I can go to the store myself and get something else. Anything else!</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used(the shampoo is crap too), and I&#x27;ve used a ton of them. I have normal, if somewhat dry caucasian hair, and after I was done using this my hair felt so disgusting. It left what feels like a waxy buildup over each and every strand of hair, it was awful. It wasn&#x27;t oily, but more like wax, which was very strange. My hair looked dirty and awful, the color was dulled and you could see no highlights. Not to mention I let my hair air dry to avoid undo damage, and this took by no exaggeration about 4 times longer to dry than if I had used a more normal shampoo.   Do not buy this line of products and do not be roped into the environmentally friendly bit like I was, there are plenty of environmentally responsible shampoos/conditioners out there that work just fine, this however is awful and I don&#x27;t know how it even got on the market. Did they even freaking test this stuff before putting it out there?! I don&#x27;t think so!! I want my money back Garnier, these products suck.</li>
    <li> This is the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have smooth, silky, Asian hair, and after using the conditioner, my hair just feels dirtier.  I can&#x27;t seem to wash off the conditioner; it leaves behind this waxy residue.  Now, my hair feels brittle, dry...just unhealthy.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this product got such a bad review. My hair is pretty finicky and it takes some searching to get a product that works. I found this product a year ago and I&#x27;ve stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, it takes some getting used to. Unlike other conditioners that I&#x27;ve just massaged in and then rinsed out right away, this one needs to stay in for a few minutes before you rinse it out. So, shampoo first, rinse clean, massage in conditioner, continue with the rest of your shower and rinse this out last. It&#x27;s really not anywhere near as much work as it appears written. ^^;;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I KNOW this stuff works because I ran out of this conditioner a week ago. First day without it was fine, but since then my hair has been flat, tangled, and gets very static-y. Because it tangles, I need to brush, but as as soon as I brush, my hairs stand up because of the static. That has NEVER happened while I used this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this product is environmentally friendly - that&#x27;s always a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m buying some more. Just saw the 1-star review and was shocked, so I thought I&#x27;d add another perspective while I here making my purchase. I just wish I hadn&#x27;t waited a week. I detest having to try brushing out tangles in my hair. &gt;\\&quot;&amp;lt;</li>
    <li> I bought this despite all the bad reviews after reading the good reviews, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I don&#x27;t have any problems with my hair feeling greasy or having to use a lot of product in order to get to all of my hair. Actually, the ends of my hair are quite happy and my hair is clean and light! It&#x27;s also more manageable, less frizzy, and easier to detangle after I&#x27;ve used this conditioner. Also, the smell, which is really nice, is strong and stays in for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really thick and pretty coarse, and half of it is bleached to a 10 platinum level and much thinner. This conditioner treats my whole head evenly and consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used some other normal Garnier conditioner for most of the 2014-15 fall to spring months and have used the company&#x27;s products before, and this is nothing worse than I&#x27;ve ever experienced. After using this for a month, I think this conditioner is totally fine! The smell is nicer and much stronger than the other Garnier conditioner I used last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably agree with other reviewers regarding leaving the conditioner in for a few minutes before rinsing out, but I never rinse my conditioner out immediately anyway, so I honestly haven&#x27;t experienced the &amp;#34;slime&amp;#34; or other unpleasant textures I&#x27;ve read in some of the reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My use of the product is a bit different in that I use it, as I did another Garnier conditoner, as my shampoo and conditioning product. I put vinegar into the bottle and don&#x27;t use a dedicated shampoo product; I instead clean my scalp with this, rinse clean, and then apply it to the rest of my hair while I do all other shower things. Even with the immediate rinsing when I am &#x27;shampooiing&#x27; my hair, I don&#x27;t experience the slime or unclean textures people have described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this as a conditioning treatment, leaving it in my hair for some 20 minutes before rinsing out completely, and the detangling and softening effectsare good! More noticeable than normal conditioning, which would total something like 7 minutes at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why this has so many negative reviews, but my experience has been a good one. This conditioner is really light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, smells great, and makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very surprised by all the negative reviews... I just recently got this conditioner.  I have bleached hair that needs a good moisturizing and repairing conditioner.  I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair long... When I saw this product, I was enthusiastic to try it...It has oils and vitamins in it...no silicones even better since I already use a styling mousse with a little bit of silicone in it.  I don&#x27;t want a ton of silicone in my hair.  Well, Garnier pure clean left my hair soft, stronger and no tangles...easily combing it.  The scent is heavenly...I even got complimented on it.  The &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; is probably the oils...My hair drinks that stuff happily and I barely get any residue but some other people might have different hair...Use less, rinse very well and see if it&#x27;s better;).</li>
    <li> Kudos for going green, which is why I&#x27;ll give it a two star instead of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not untangle or soften my hair. It pretty much does nothing and I feel like I bought it just to wash it down the drain. I have to use a handful of this to even feel a difference. This is worse than $1 conditioner and is very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great start for green products because the bottle is recyclable and the product is biodegradable, but it still needs a lot of improvement on quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this conditioner as a substitute for my normal conditioner, which was out of stock. Unlike ANY other conditioner I have ever used, this conditioner left my hair looking absolutely AWFUL. My hair is very thick and usually very wavy with a good deal of natural shine and body to it (I do not use any product other than shampoo &amp; conditioner, and always air-dry my hair). After using this conditioner, my hair was limp, dull, dirty-looking, and coated with an odd residue (one other reviewer described it as waxy, which is pretty accurate). I don&#x27;t know what the heck I&#x27;m going to do with the rest of the bottle, because I&#x27;m sure not going to use it.</li>
    <li> I had been using Yes To Carrots for a while and saw the Garnier Fructis Pure Clean conditioner on sale at my local supermarket and decided to give it a try.  It smelled great and I was excited about it being \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;  I did not use in combination with the shampoo since I already had shampoo, (I often need to buy conditioner before buying shampoo) but after reading the reviews of the shampoo I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  The conditioner leaves my hair feeling so greasy it&#x27;s as if I never showered.  I&#x27;ve even tried rinsing for an extended period of time and still it comes out greasy.  Maybe it&#x27; because I have thin hair, but my hair type shouldn&#x27;t matter if a product is boasting that it is PURE CLEAN.  The only positive of this product is that it smells nice.  I will be switching back to Yes To Carrots.</li>
    <li> I am fond of Garnier products. I decided to give this one a shot. I was incredibly disappointed at the quality of this conditioner. It&#x27;s like it has no substance whatsoever. It did not remove the tangles from my hair. It didn&#x27;t really feel like it did anything. I have switched to their &amp;#34;Fall Fight&amp;#34; kind and am much happier with the results.</li>
    <li> Biggest mistake getting this conditioner. Didn&#x27;t see reviews and got it off the shelf and guess what? The knots in my hair are so Tangled, Disney is having it star in a sequel opposite my fresh out of my jeans pocket earphones.</li>
    <li> for similar price points i bought suave&#x27;s argan oil conditioner as well&lt;br /&gt;cant deny that the argan oil one worked better in smoothing out the tangles for my thin and dyed , permed hair&lt;br /&gt;garniers smelled more pleasant, and i had to use quite a lot, Twice, in order for the hair to be smoothened out when rinsing it.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have been using natural, silicone free products for years. A lot of silicone free conditioners will not give your hair the same silky smooth feeling that you may get with other products, but I am used to (and expect) that. This stuff was awful though. It made my hair feel both greasy and dried out at the same time. I felt like my hair was constantly dirty! I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I bought this mostly because it smells great. Im one of those people who can use almost any kind of shampoo and conditioner with no problems. I&#x27;m not picky, I just want my hair to smell good. This is the WORST shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. It made my hair look oily and feel gross. I used it 5-6 times and threw it away. Do not waste money on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for the past week and must say this is the worst conditioner I have ever used. It makes my hair feel greasy all the time. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they managed it, but Garnier created a conditioner that is neither moisturizing nor detangling. It leaves a buildup on my hair that makes it really tangly, and my hair feels rough, not soft.</li>
    <li> I adore supporting products that keep our planet cleaner. I will gladly pay a bit more to use products that are biodegradable and more earth-friendly. So I was thrilled when I saw the Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Shampoo and Conditioner set. It claims to be 92% biodegradable with no silicone, paraben, or dye. Fine by me. I don&#x27;t need dyes in my hair wash. I just need it to clean my hair well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I donate my hair to charity every 2-3 years once it gets about waist length. So I want to do my very best to care for my hair as thoroughly as I can. That is, while I want to keep the earth happy, I also want my hair to be healthy. I test out a variety of conditioners to see what I can find to be the best balance. While a shampoo just needs to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; the hair - which is fairly simple - for me the conditioner is absolutely critical to keep the hair from tangling. Especially when my hair gets past mid-back, if it tangles and snarls I can lose a lot of hair to the knots. I want as much hair as possible to be available for the charity. I want, every day, for the hair to be as perfect and tangle free and easy to brush as I can get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big problem for me with the Garnier Fructis is that it is as thick as hand lotion. My hair is thick. That means to somehow work this thick lotion through all the layers of my hair is quite a challenge. With most conditioners I can gently move the hair around and the conditioner gets to all the hairs naturally. Here with the conditioner being incredibly thick it is much harder to ensure all the layers of hair get coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it should when I&#x27;m done. I was testing this after a set of Suave testing and certainly it&#x27;s better than the Suave level of products. But it&#x27;s not nearly as good as the conditioners I normally use. It ends up being sticky and greasy, meaning any dirt or pollen in the air will now catch on that and make my hair look dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also just not sure about this 92% biodegradable claim. I keep wondering if all other conditioners are 90% biodegradabale and there&#x27;s not really any difference here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my hair being an \\&quot;investment\\&quot; I&#x27;m making for charity purposes, I&#x27;m just not willing to sacrifice it with this product, especially when there are so many other better options out there.ot sure about this 92% biodegradable claim.

    <li> The title says it all.  This conditioner leaves a film on my fine hair, weighing it down and making it heavy.  I couldn&#x27;t rinse this conditioner enough and still felt a waxy coating, even after shampooing.  Great idea and concept, but poor execution by Garnier.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair tangly- I can hardly get a brush through it after using this.  And I have perfectly straight medium thickness hair- the easiest hair on earth.  Not recommended at all.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, I have straight dark brown hair so I&#x27;m picky about that feeling of something remaining in my hair after rinsing. It leaves my hair so smooth it tricks you into thinking \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; until you realize how quickly your hair dries and viola! no greasy feeling. It takes a bit longer to rinse out because it is lacking the chemicals other conditioners have to assist in a quick clean rinse \\&quot;silicon\\&quot;. Silicon creates a water tight seal on your pores, so your hair never actually gets conditioned, leaving your hair famished but smooth. If your health isn&#x27;t as important as your time this isn&#x27;t your conditioner. I love this product and love the way it smells! If you have thin low density hair it will leave you feeling oiled and weighed down.</li>
    <li> After showering and my hair dries, it always leaves an awful metallic smell in my hair.</li>
    <li> I first tried this when I showered at a friend&#x27;s place. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I liked that it had very little scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later I switched to some low-scent products, including this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is fine. I&#x27;ve used the clarifying Pure Clean shampoo and one of the anti-dandruff Pure Clean shampoos, and they simply do what they say they will, with a bit less perfume than some other shampoos in the same price range. Nothing earth-shattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s the conditioner. Holy Moses! My hair loves it. LOVES it. The last time my hair was this soft, I was using Redken All Soft Conditioner Unisex Conditioner, 8.5 Ounce for some absurd sum of money spent at a local salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff seems thinner, less viscous than most conditioners, so it&#x27;s a little strange working it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see other reviewers complain it makes their hair look dirty or dark. I have long, thick, mostly straight, unprocessed auburn hair that trends toward dry and/or frizzy, and I do notice that I have to wash my hair a little more often when I use this conditioner. My rule is not to wash it if I haven&#x27;t worked out or spent time outside AND if I&#x27;m having a good hair day. This usually means an every-other-day wash, but there are weeks where I can go up to four days without one.  I have never noticed my hair looking darker with this product, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days, with this product, my hair REALLY needs a wash. It behaves itself, smells nice, and feels wonderfully soft, but it looks greasy, so I either have to hide it by pulling it up or I have to wash it earlier than I would otherwise. I don&#x27;t know why that is so. It&#x27;s still frizzy, but I have used every product on the face of this earth, and there will *always* be flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps - good luck with your hair product of choice!</li>
    <li> I hated this shampoo and conditioner. I have long, fine, blonde hair that needs to be washed every other day. The first time I used the s/c set, I noticed that my hair took forever to dry (it&#x27;s usually dry in 30 minutes through air dry) and my hair was still wet 2 hours later. It also felt thick, but not like good, luscious &amp; thick, but like it had a coating of junk on it thick. By the end of the day, I looked like I hadn&#x27;t showered in a week. It was embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured that I probably didn&#x27;t rinse my hair well enough, so I tried it again the next day. Same story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third day, I used the shampoo by itself. My hair definitely felt better than it had with the conditioner, but it still felt heavy, and looked dry and didn&#x27;t feel like my hair. I will say my hair felt thicker, but I need conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using this s/c for a week or more, trying different combos... even mixing the conditioner in with the shampoo to hopefully cut the grease while still conditioning. It helped a little, but I was still annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up contacting Garnier, and the customer service was nice and sent me coupons to replace my shampoo with another garnier product. They sent me 2 $3 coupons and one $1 coupon. Last night I went to the store and saw this new shine spray they have for about $6.50, so I figured I would buy it with my 3 coupons. Well, the store told me I could only use one coupon per item. I am calling Garnier back to issue me a $7.00 coupon. I don&#x27;t want THREE new Garnier products, and I don&#x27;t want to have to pay a cent for a replacement. Ugh. I&#x27;m annoyed. I really wanted to like this product because natural shampoos can be expensive....</li>
    <li> I give this conditioner 1 star, only because I can&#x27;t give it 0. I must say, I have been a fan and long time user of garnier. I love the smell and my hair feels very nice after using it. I decided to buy this because 1. it was on sale and 2. i figured something that was good for the environment would be great. Worst mistake ever!! It leaves my hair feeling dry, and I find i have to use twice as much just to be able to get my fingers through my hair at all. It honestly feels like shampoo. My hair feels brittle and stringy after washing it, and after it&#x27;s dry its simply lifeless. Everytime I use it, I curse myself for not throwing it away after the first try and not buying my old Garnier. Seriously, if you have longer hair and use it to untangle and moisturize your hair, this is the wrong choice!!</li>
    <li> I had used this Shampoo and Conditioner combo for about a week when I noticed that my head was itchy and I started seeing flakes. I have NEVER had problems with itchy scalp or dandruff before, but this gave me BOTH.  It has been misery.  Needless to say, this stuff will go right in the garbage.</li>
