      <li>this is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>It works good on medium-coarse textures, but not on fine hair.</li>
      <li>and this one is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>When I  asked her how she liked the new iron a couple of times, she said yeh, it works great.</li>
      <li>I love this iron, but why did it stop working?????</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>Better off with Babyliss.</li>
      <li>I love this hair straightener.</li>
      <li>I would repurchased for the sole reason that the item does work wonderfully.</li>
      <li>and it was so much better than any others i have had before.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever bought!</li>
      <li>Um, hands down this is the best hair straightener ever.  </li>
      <li>so I sent it to \\&quot;elephant\\&quot; where it came from and I received Two calls saying the product was working fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Return policy only good for 30 days here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to try and contact the mfg.</li>
      <li>And she truely loves how the croc works...</li>
      <li>I recieved it quick</li>
      <li>ok I dealt with it because I love my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does the job and heats up pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>The wire came right out of the end of the straightener on the first one.  </li>
      <li>I first learned about it when i was at a salon.</li>
      <li>With the iron on the same heat setting my hair feels smooth and shiny!</li>
      <li>This is my 2nd Croc because I love it so much!</li>
      <li>She bought the first one which broke in under 2 months.  </li>
      <li>should last more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pamela</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better flat iron..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still in love with my infra shine flat iron</li>
      <li>Just received my order today and love my flat iron.</li>
      <li>It heats up very fast and my curly hair is straight in minutes.  </li>
      <li>Whoever invented this is a pure genius.</li>
      <li>If I really didnt want the product...</li>
      <li>It really does a difference to my hair.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointing.</li>
      <li>Packaging  from Amazon didn&#x27;t impress me much.</li>
      <li>The titanium irons I have used in the past are far superior to this.  </li>
      <li>You can change the temperature digitally and it heats up quickly.  </li>
      <li>and it is super flat!  </li>
      <li>I talked to someone else who had the exact same problem.</li>
      <li>I do think it works good as far as flat ironing, but if I&#x27;m working on finer textures it snags and pulls the hair, not very pleasant for my clients.</li>
      <li>I had to buy it because it made my hair so soft</li>
      <li>Apparently since it was bought from an unauthorized dealer, Croc doesn&#x27;t include the warranty.</li>
      <li>The new manufacturers packaged product was in an empty box.</li>
      <li>I have coarse hair and usually have to use a high setting with other flat iorns but this iorn gets hot</li>

    <li> Purchased this item after reading great reviews and it died after 9 months of use. Very dissapointing. I would repurchased for the sole reason that the item does work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straighter from Amazon about a year ago.  The product works great, even on fine hair.  The only problem is that it stopped working after a year.  Will still order another.</li>
    <li> Just received my order today and love my flat iron. It really does a difference to my hair. My old flat iron fried my hair and made it feel rough. With the iron on the same heat setting my hair feels smooth and shiny!</li>
    <li> Um, hands down this is the best hair straightener ever.  I&#x27;ve used Chi, Biosilk and BedHead and this one is by far the best.  My BedHead caught fire so I overnighted this one and I am super impressed.  You can change the temperature digitally and it heats up quickly.  I only have to go over each section one time and it is super flat!  It stays that way all day instead of frizzing up.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 7/26/2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My straightener died today. It&#x27;s shorting out. Apparently since it was bought from an unauthorized dealer, Croc doesn&#x27;t include the warranty.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about 2 months ago and today when I turned it on it went to 69 degrees and err came up and shut off.  It wont heat up.  I just emailed the company to find out why this is happening.  I read on google to plug it in and hold down the power button for 20 seconds to reset itself, this did not work.  I love this iron, but why did it stop working?????</li>
    <li> Iron stopped working with in a few months.bought in june stopped working in october. The iron heast up to 450 degrees, but with in a few months it only heated up to 217 then 59. Then it displayed &#x27;err&#x27;  and shuts off and will not work!!!  these irons r muvh to expensive to only last a few months.....And do the the lack of concern on AMAZONS part i Will never buy another croc or anything from AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my wife. She drops everything  electronic, so things I buy for her have to be sturdy.  She has only dropped this iron once, and it held up.  Still works, and nothing fell off, or cracked. The last iron she had was only dropped once and it broke the ceramic plate on one side. We have porcelin tile floors  which is a pretty hard surface. When I  asked her how she liked the new iron a couple of times, she said yeh, it works great. But thats all she said about it, and since she hasn&#x27;t complained, we&#x27;re going to recommend  it to Amazon customers. Shipping was on time. Packaging  from Amazon didn&#x27;t impress me much. The new manufacturers packaged product was in an empty box. No shipping peanuts or anything to help protect it. No packing list,invoice, or thank you. Just the packaged product loose in an empty box.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product.  I recieved it quick, it works great, you can even curl ar wave your hair with this straightner! I have coarse hair and usually have to use a high setting with other flat iorns but this iorn gets hot and I do not have to use the hottest setting. I am very happy with it and will probably buy from here again if the need arises.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product. It heats up very fast and my curly hair is straight in minutes.  It looks silky and not frizzy.  I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better flat iron..Whoever invented this is a pure genius. I spend a lot less money now that I do not have to go to the salon as often. I can practically do it myself. But now after five months it just stop working..it just turns on n says err n then it turns off. I need a flat iron that is going to last longer than a year.</li>
    <li> I needed a 450 degree flat iron, since mine only went to 400. At the salon we started doing Brazilian blowouts and this is the iron they reccomend. I do think it works good as far as flat ironing, but if I&#x27;m working on finer textures it snags and pulls the hair, not very pleasant for my clients. It works good on medium-coarse textures, but not on fine hair. Also, it&#x27;s kinda bulky, so when your trying to get close to the root for curlier hair, it&#x27;s a little difficult. I like this iron but I don&#x27;t love it. I&#x27;m still in love with my infra shine flat iron</li>
    <li> I received this product and within 2 days it was shutting itself off. I ONLY wanted an exchange..so I sent it to \\&quot;elephant\\&quot; where it came from and I received Two calls saying the product was working fine. I know for a fact this flat iron would shut off as the cord would twist, but instead of exchange, they sent the SAME ONE back!!!! If I really didnt want the product...why wouldnt I have just asked for a refund? EXCHANGE EXCHANGE!!!I will never get a product again that has anything to do with \\&quot;elephant\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I bought this Crox Turboion Titanium straightener for my wife.  This is the second one from Amazon we have bought within a year.  She bought the first one which broke in under 2 months.  The wire came right out of the end of the straightener on the first one.  She thought maybe somehow she had damaged it and I bought her the second one (this one).  I bought it on 12/6/11 and as of this morning, it will not even turn on.  It&#x27;s less than 6 months old!  What a disappointment!  And she truely loves how the croc works...WHEN IT WORKS!  I guess we will be in search of yet another hair straightener.  Anyone have any reccomendations?</li>
    <li> Loved this product until it stopped working 2 weeks after we got it.  Sent it back but still have not heard from the company.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener. I first learned about it when i was at a salon. I had to buy it because it made my hair so soft and it was so much better than any others i have had before.  i would never buy any other straightener again. it will always be a croc.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t even last 6 months before shorting out. I talked to someone else who had the exact same problem.</li>
    <li> This is a very hard to handle iron.  The titanium irons I have used in the past are far superior to this.  There is not enough &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; when pulling thru the hair and often find the temperature inconsistent.  Better off with Babyliss.</li>
    <li> I still have it and use it every day!!!!!</li>
    <li> It does the job and heats up pretty quickly. Nothing to complain about it, and the price is unbeatable considering what you would pay somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I loved this flat-iron. Loved it. And then a month ago the Temp setting starting being wonky and wouldn&#x27;t go up to the 430 max. It stopped on 230... ok I dealt with it because I love my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord shorted out where it connects to the handle yesterday... I am devestated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return policy only good for 30 days here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to try and contact the mfg. I feel that a $100+ flatiron should last more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pamela</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Croc because I love it so much!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever bought!</li>
