### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is incredible, period!</li>
      <li>(: I&#x27;m so happy I found it!</li>
      <li>Now that stuff is great!</li>
      <li>One of the best products in market for acne.</li>
      <li>However it is an excellent cleanser.</li>
      <li>Warmth is wonderful!</li>
      <li>mom used to buy this for herself (even though she has perfect skin).</li>
      <li>It worked wonderfully, cleared up my skin, and did not cause acne.</li>
      <li>I use it in combination with an anti-oxidant day cream and a retinol night cream and have the best complexion in years.</li>
      <li>This product is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>I have never had beautiful skin-</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied!</li>
      <li>A great product.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, this stuff works great for me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is great for anyone who has skin problems.</li>
      <li>Shipping was great, product didnt agree with my skin.</li>
      <li>After rinsing I&#x27;d be startled by my bright reflection.</li>
      <li>I got it at Walmart because I heard it was good for zits.</li>
      <li>They made good on it and gave me an amzon credit.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m very confident that this will be my life time product  </li>
      <li>I have no idea what to try after using this for so many years!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d use it and the results were really nice.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and is not over powering.</li>
      <li>I had perfect skin through high school and for year after.</li>
      <li>Once you start to rub it on your face the scrub has a very strong menthol odor.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that it&#x27;s changing my life for the better, day by day.</li>
      <li>The original was great because it rinsed off easily and did not feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When you wash your face with this, you know it&#x27;s working because you can feel a tingly, refreshing, minty feeling all over your face.</li>
      <li>Proactiv didn&#x27;t work, clearasil didn&#x27;t work, neutrogena didn&#x27;t work, but this baby, it sure did.</li>
      <li>I  Bought this product at walmart  for $3 and some change, I did a a lot of research on the best products I have only been using this product for  2 days</li>
      <li>Okay, im 18</li>
      <li>it better  and feels softer.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The packaging said that it worked better than Proactiv, so I thought, \\&quot;Why</li>
      <li>I think it is hilarious that Biore put a &amp;#34;New Look&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This product claims it works better than proactiv</li>
      <li>and this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make my face more oily.</li>
      <li>I do wish it was a bit more abrasive</li>
      <li>This product was much more of a face cleanser than a scrub.</li>
      <li>Love this use it at night to get the face nice and clean before bedtime.</li>
      <li>Okay, so I used to be able to buy a fantastic Biore pore unclogging face scrub on the highstreet, but they&#x27;ve stopped stocking it, so I went on an online hunt.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a cream wash with some light grit in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a mostly oily complexion and this product cleans my skin thoroughly, leaving it smooth and non-shiny for hours.</li>
      <li>I promise you it will help tremendously!</li>
      <li>it feels like it&#x27;s super oily!  </li>
      <li>Suddenly, I felt the most pleasant tingling sensation.</li>
      <li>Cheap scrub that leaves an oily residue.  </li>
      <li>I recently bought this at a drugstore because i had heard many good reviews about it.</li>
      <li>It was OK right after I used it</li>
      <li>The old version was much better; mild but extremely effective.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t love at first sight for me and Biore Pore</li>
      <li>used the original product for years.</li>
      <li>Although the new formula has not caused the irritation that others have mentioned, I found that it feels oily, kind of like &amp;#34;Softsoap&amp;#34;, and doesn&#x27;t rinse off cleanly.</li>
      <li>Does this scrub clean the surface of your face?</li>
      <li>I suddenly had bright glowing skin-</li>
      <li>It is really just an okay cleanser.</li>
      <li>, there was a tremendous difference, my glow came back and my skin looked fresh and bright again.</li>
      <li>I tried many different products throughout the years and most worsened my breakouts.</li>
      <li>I use it twice a day, morning and night, and the results have just been nothing short of amazing.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it in gentle yet effective.</li>
      <li>I was so happy when I found the old \\&quot;green\\&quot; Biore Pore Unclogging Facial Scrub.</li>
      <li>and if you don&#x27;t like then  you have not wasted any time it just means your one step closer to finding the right one :)</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;ve used other face scrubs and didn&#x27;t have as good results.  </li>
      <li>I think that the thing with skin cleaners, is that everyone has to find the right formula for them.</li>
      <li>This month was my first time using it consistently, and my skin is truly clearer, smoother, softer, and tremendously clog-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So here&#x27;s the horror story part of it all, I had 3 HUGE zits on the left side of my face and 5 HUGE zits on the right.</li>
      <li>I have NEVER had so many GIGANTIC zits at the same time!</li>
      <li>I just finished my first tube, and immediately rushed out for another one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve even been able to cut back on the amount of makeup I wear, because of this scrub.</li>
      <li>First off, It&#x27;s cheaper at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I will have to wait and see if this works out for me, if not, it will be another fantastic product abandoned because of changes to the ingredients that irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>and i have tried many different treatments and masks for my face over the years.</li>
      <li>I could care less what it smells like), but this stuff smells so refreshing and clean.</li>
      <li>clean, clear</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first wash went really well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had clogged pores for months, particularly on my nose, and have tried so many facial scrubs to get rid of them.</li>
      <li>Normally my pores are pretty clean naturally</li>
      <li>I bough the Biore scrub at a large retail chain and also had a dollar off coupon</li>
      <li>So to no surprise, I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>The reason being that if i just wash it once, all its doing it getting the makeup off my face, it doesn&#x27;t really give it a chance to cleanse my pores.</li>
      <li>The scrubbiest scrub doesnt do much to help with that, though scrubs do tend to help with the peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In the store the product had a gentle melon scent</li>
      <li>I really hope this product will be okay for me, and I really hope it works for other people.  </li>
      <li>noticed some skin irritation on my face after my first time using this new formula, but attributed it to the weather- my allergies had been out of control.</li>
      <li>I am now very careful in making sure the scrub doesn&#x27;t get anywhere where I cannot physically make sure my hand is washing it off, as I cannot rely on the water pressure alone apparently.</li>
      <li>Like many girls my age, i wear foundation on my face pretty much everyday.</li>
      <li>I was looking to change up my skin care routine because i noticed that my once dormant acne was back in full force.  </li>
      <li>Normally I can go without much makeup or none at all</li>
      <li>This particular formula has transformed my skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, and washing your face twice in a row with it.</li>
      <li>I tried this product with high hopes.  </li>
      <li>just want tostart my review by saying, I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>, it is a little more like a wash than a scrub.</li>
      <li>It is a little drying, however, so make sure you moisturize soon after washing your face with it.</li>
      <li>Skin clear and ready for makeup.</li>
      <li>I was very skeptical because I have sensitive skin, but this product is awesome.</li>
      <li>I felt so fresh after each wash and my skin was softer and any inflammation would decrease dramatically directly following each use.</li>
      <li>These variables could be the key to finding the right cleaner for you.</li>
      <li>And a little bit goes a long way too... which is always nice, since you don&#x27;t have to buy it as often, although it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using for years.  A great product.  Warmth is wonderful!</li>
    <li> First off, It&#x27;s cheaper at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. I use this stuff every day! My skin couldn&#x27;t be any softer!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but I only think that is because my skin is oily.&lt;br /&gt;My skin used to be in terrible condition, and only after using this twice my skin in amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I use it once when I wake up, And again when I&#x27;m in the shower to use the steam to open my my pores.&lt;br /&gt;I also have horrible acne, and I used it once, and my skin cleared up fast!&lt;br /&gt;This is great for anyone who has skin problems.</li>
    <li> I tried this product with high hopes.  I was looking to change up my skin care routine because i noticed that my once dormant acne was back in full force.  Well i believe that the salicylic acid in this product did not unclog my pores and even contributed to the worsening of my acne.  In addition to big bumps, i also have those irritating red bumps on both my cheeks and forehead.  I will be making a trip to my dermatologist as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne. It&#x27;s humiliating. I had perfect skin through high school and for year after. Once I hit 22, my skin rebelled against me. I tried every single thing you could imagine including proactiv. This product claims it works better than proactiv and I think it does. It is a little drying, however, so make sure you moisturize soon after washing your face with it. I do wish it was a bit more abrasive, it is a little more like a wash than a scrub. But it definitely does the job. I don&#x27;t break out quite as bad anymore. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I  Bought this product at walmart  for $3 and some change, I did a a lot of research on the best products I have only been using this product for  2 days and I can feel the difference my skin it better  and feels softer. My husband even notice and so if your single  you will get noticeable soft skin, the black heads  around my nose and cheek are going away and it&#x27;s only been 2 days, I&#x27;m very confident that this will be my life time product  I&#x27;m doing my break out phase  and I am about to start my monthly cycle and it&#x27;s clearing the break out. Give it product a try and if you don&#x27;t like then  you have not wasted any time it just means your one step closer to finding the right one :)</li>
    <li> Does this scrub clean the surface of your face? Yes. However its properties and its claim that it unclogs pores are what made me throw this in the garbage. I&#x27;ve had clogged pores for months, particularly on my nose, and have tried so many facial scrubs to get rid of them. I bough the Biore scrub at a large retail chain and also had a dollar off coupon so I thought for 4 bucks why not give it a shot. I should have saved my money. In the store the product had a gentle melon scent but it&#x27;s not until you use it that the problems begin. Once you start to rub it on your face the scrub has a very strong menthol odor. Besides the stench I have chronic dry eye so my eyes are very sensitive. They started to burn from the menthol. If you are going to use this, use as little as possible otherwise the menthol just overwhelms you. After I used it a couple of times it did no better than anything else I&#x27;d used to get rid of the clogged pores. It simply didn&#x27;t work. Sorry but if it doesn&#x27;t perform after 3 or 4 days it&#x27;s not worth the money. My sister ended up giving me an Oil of Olay Pro-X. I used it with my Aveeno Daily Scrub and it made such the difference. If you don&#x27;t have serious skin issues invest $30 in a Pro-X, combine with your favorite scrub, and truly have cleaner pores.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy anything other thatn this product. One of the best products in market for acne. My skin is baby soft all acne is gone!!!</li>
    <li> *********Updated Review********** June 26, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biore has recently changed this item while combining, or getting rid of other products- both the packaging and ingredients. Any reviews posted before May 2012 are for a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that they had updated the packaging, I didn&#x27;t panic at all because I assumed the formula inside would be the same. I&#x27;ve had flaky, oily, acne-prone skin since I was 12- So that&#x27;s 14 years now. But last year when I made Biore Pore Unclogging scrub a regular part of my daily routine, everything changed. I suddenly had bright glowing skin- everybody noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some skin irritation on my face after my first time using this new formula, but attributed it to the weather- my allergies had been out of control. But it&#x27;s weeks later and my allergies have mellowed out, and my face has been looking duller and duller (and it&#x27;s still been feeling itchy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently moved into a new apartment and have been slowly unpacking and sorting through all of my things to see if there&#x27;s stuff that can be donated. Well, when I was checking my suitcase I found an unused bottle of the old formula and decided to try it out and see if there was a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, there was a tremendous difference, my glow came back and my skin looked fresh and bright again. This result prompted me to compare the ingredients list and things have definitely changed. The new formula and old formula are different. I hope the new formula will work wonders for someone, but Im not that person unfortunately. Readers, if you have any recommendations I&#x27;m on the quest to find my new &#x27;product that works&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon only recently updated the image for this product so my review for this new formula is also posted under another seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******************Previous Review from April 2011*****************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;title: \\&quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Have to be Sand to be Awesome!!!!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want tostart my review by saying, I highly recommend this product. If you read the ingredients, you will recognize them from other face cleaners that you&#x27;ve used in the past. I did. I think that the thing with skin cleaners, is that everyone has to find the right formula for them. This particular formula has transformed my skin. Sometimes a product doesnt work as well from person to person because the different measures of each ingredient might serve as an irritant. These variables could be the key to finding the right cleaner for you. This month was my first time using it consistently, and my skin is truly clearer, smoother, softer, and tremendously clog-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had problem skin since I was 12. That&#x27;s 13 years of oily skin that peels and breaks out. I&#x27;d experience pretty constant discomfort and my skin would show signs of dryness (flaking) and oiliness every morning. I&#x27;ve also had trouble with non-pimple bumps on the front of my cheeks, that I can only assume are the result of clogged pores. The scrubbiest scrub doesnt do much to help with that, though scrubs do tend to help with the peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom used to buy this for herself (even though she has perfect skin). I&#x27;d use it and the results were really nice. I felt so fresh after each wash and my skin was softer and any inflammation would decrease dramatically directly following each use. After moving deeper into the city, it&#x27;s been a lot harder to find my favorite personal products because the stores are much smaller and have only a few items per brand of... well anything. There&#x27;s a CVS near me that sells cosmetics only, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use this, you&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s cool and creamy with only a few beads. It isnt a pumice-type scrub. A lot of reviewers were disappointed that this product doesnt do much in the way of sanding your skin, but dont be fooled. I finally found this at a Pharmacy nearby and Initially, I was using the warming anti-blackhead scrub... (which actually ISpretty sandy). But after getting halfway through the bottle I realized that it wasn&#x27;t helping my most serious problems, and my skin would feel a little sticky while drying... I think this has to do with incomplete pore extractions... (I know... gross). So I went back and bought this one instead- it was the only other bottle that resembled what my mom used to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first wash went really well. After rinsing I&#x27;d be startled by my bright reflection. I thought it was in my mind. But weeks have gone by and this is my first time owning this scrub versus borrowing it occasionally on vacations or when using my parent&#x27;s shower out of necessity. The results are truly astonishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could feel my monthly breakout coming... which is a painful tingling feeling... and usually only one side of my face breaks out. But the breakout never really happened. Some small bumps started to form but they weren&#x27;t visible... I could feel them and they disappeared without incident. I also have a lot of dark acne scars/blemishes which are vanishing. I have never had beautiful skin- I am the only one in my family with awful skin and for the first time since I was a child,I FINALLY HAVE SOFT, SMOOTH, VIBRANT SKIN. A different skin cleaner might be what works for you but DON&#x27;T GIVE UP, and at least give this product a try.</li>
    <li> This product was much more of a face cleanser than a scrub. Perhaps you would like this product if you have sensitive skin that gets irritated from heavier exfoliants... Personally, I am switching back to St. Ives Apricot Scrub. Now that stuff is great!</li>
    <li> It was OK right after I used it but the next day, my skin was weirdly dry and tight. That afternoon my skin started itching.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it since then.</li>
    <li> Let me give you some history on my skin, as this might help other potential buyers evaluate whether this product would work for them: I&#x27;ve had acne most of my life. As a teen, I went through two rounds of Accutane due to cystic acne. It always seemed like no matter what I did, I&#x27;d get deep painful acne that would pop up over night, mainly on my cheeks and chin. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything prescription and over the counter, and found very few products that work for me. Now in my 30&#x27;s, I mainly deal with oily skin, whiteheads, the occasional blackhead, and the dreaded random big zit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I bought this cleanser on blind faith. I was packing for a week-long trip and realized that I was short on Proactiv, which I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 years. The packaging said that it worked better than Proactiv, so I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t love at first sight for me and Biore Pore Perfect--not until I left it on my face out of laziness while I shaved my legs. Suddenly, I felt the most pleasant tingling sensation. It felt so good and smelled so nice, that the next few times I showered, I decided to leave the scrub on my face just a little longer than usual. Soon after, I started to notice that my skin&#x27;s texture had improved, and I couldn&#x27;t remember my last zit. Four months later, and I&#x27;m still using the Biore \\&quot;scrub\\&quot;. I say \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; because it&#x27;s really not very scrubby, but I like the texture nonetheless. It&#x27;s more of a cream wash with some light grit in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone with similar skin issues. I have less breakouts, and I&#x27;m spending less money to get clean, clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip for other buyers: After I get out of the shower, I follow up with Clinique Clarifying Lotion #3 and Proactiv Extra Strength Benzoyl Peroxide lotion. BAM! Skin clear and ready for makeup.</li>
    <li> Shipping was great, product didnt agree with my skin.</li>
    <li> I changed some of my eating habits and was thinking I was getting healthier until my skin started to rebel and broke out. Normally I can go without much makeup or none at all so I was a bit upset. Then I found a coupon for this product and decided to give it a try. Normally my pores are pretty clean naturally so I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference in that department. What I did notice was that my breakout cleared up in a week. Also I have sensitive skin that is oily in the T-zone and this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make my face more oily. I&#x27;ll be buying this again. One container lasts about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> It really isn&#x27;t a scrub, it has very few scrubbing particles. It is really just an okay cleanser. If you want a scrub, try St. Ives Apricot scrub.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this doesn&#x27;t qualify as a scrub, not enough little beady things. However it is an excellent cleanser. I have a mostly oily complexion and this product cleans my skin thoroughly, leaving it smooth and non-shiny for hours. I use it in combination with an anti-oxidant day cream and a retinol night cream and have the best complexion in years.</li>
    <li> I came to this Amazon page just to see what other people were saying about how this product has changed. I think it is hilarious that Biore put a &amp;#34;New Look&amp;#34; label on the package but they did not also state &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a new look, new product, only with a recycled name!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the original product for years. Although the new formula has not caused the irritation that others have mentioned, I found that it feels oily, kind of like &amp;#34;Softsoap&amp;#34;, and doesn&#x27;t rinse off cleanly. The original was great because it rinsed off easily and did not feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone can recommend an alternative, please do. I have no idea what to try after using this for so many years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different facial scrubs and this one works well, but isn&#x27;t my favorite. The little &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; particles aren&#x27;t as predominate in other scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past, so I don&#x27;t feel like my face is really being scrubbed when I am rubbing it on my face. Also, I&#x27;ve found it is difficult to wash off. A few times I&#x27;ve gotten out of the shower and found &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; behind my ear or on my shoulder. I am now very careful in making sure the scrub doesn&#x27;t get anywhere where I cannot physically make sure my hand is washing it off, as I cannot rely on the water pressure alone apparently. In the past few weeks of use my face as been clearer than usual, but not completely acne free and my pores are still a continuing nightmare. I keep getting pop-able pores on my nose, so maybe the scrub is actually making my pores smaller and the dirt has to come to the surface, or maybe I have no idea how that stuff works. Either way, I would use the product again in the future, but I&#x27;m probably going to go back to my St. Ive&#x27;s apricot facial scrub.</li>
    <li> Bring back the green formula! The green formula is 5 stars</li>
    <li> I am not really sure what kind of skin I have, sometimes it&#x27;s super dry and other times it feels like it&#x27;s super oily!  Anyway, this stuff works great for me.  I love the little microbeads or whatever they are called because I actually feel like my face is being cleaned and not just moisturized!  Also, I&#x27;ve used other face scrubs and didn&#x27;t have as good results.  Overall, I highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s affordable and actually works!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it, can&#x27;t keep enough of it on hand.</li>
    <li> Okay, im 18 and i have tried many different treatments and masks for my face over the years. I recently bought this at a drugstore because i had heard many good reviews about it. Let me just say they were right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background on my skin: I don&#x27;t have bad acne or anything. Pretty average breakouts and everything. But I can have some pretty bad breakouts once in a while, until i started using this product. Like many girls my age, i wear foundation on my face pretty much everyday. When i wash my face with this product, i wash it twice. The reason being that if i just wash it once, all its doing it getting the makeup off my face, it doesn&#x27;t really give it a chance to cleanse my pores. Once i started using it twice my skin cleared up almost completely and seems to just keep getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short.. I highly recommend this product, and washing your face twice in a row with it. I promise you it will help tremendously!</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible, period! I don&#x27;t often take the time to review products, but I&#x27;m so passionate about this stuff that I had to make an exception, and take the time to share my results with everyone. I have suffered from acne for atleast 10 years now, and after using this facial scrub, my skin is clearer, and smoother than I can ever remember it being. I use it twice a day, morning and night, and the results have just been nothing short of amazing. You can really feel it unclogging your pores, it exfoliates well, and I swear it has even made my pores smaller! I&#x27;ve never been one to be picky about product scents (as long as the product works I could care less what it smells like), but this stuff smells so refreshing and clean. And a little bit goes a long way too... which is always nice, since you don&#x27;t have to buy it as often, although it&#x27;s very affordable. I just finished my first tube, and immediately rushed out for another one. And as long as I continue seeing results like this, I will continue to keep this stuff on hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even been able to cut back on the amount of makeup I wear, because of this scrub. My sister, and a few of my friends have even noticed the difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve even caught my sister sneaking into my bathroom to use it herself! So to no surprise, I highly recommend this product! I can honestly say that it&#x27;s changing my life for the better, day by day. Try it, I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I like the product, BUT IT IS NOT A TWO PACK!!!!  This was disappointing.  I had to call the &amp;#34;supplier&amp;#34; to get it resolved.  They made good on it and gave me an amzon credit.  They told me the ad was not to appear the way it did.  I recommend someone fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strictly bought it for the price of the 2 pack.  A single one, I could get it cheaper some place else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure I go this route again for shopping  DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE.</li>
    <li> I have had acne for the past 15 years. I tried many different products throughout the years and most worsened my breakouts. I usually only used water to wash my face. I was so happy when I found the old \\&quot;green\\&quot; Biore Pore Unclogging Facial Scrub. It worked wonderfully, cleared up my skin, and did not cause acne. I bought the new \\&quot;blue\\&quot; formula and have been using it on and off for the past few months. It seemed to worsen my breakouts. Initially I though I was crazy because it had worked wonders before. I stopped using it for a few weeks at a time and every time I used it my acne would worsen. I finally threw it out today. I am very disappointed in the new formula. I am not looking forward to trying to find a new product that works for me.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness! This product is AMAZING!!! I got it at Walmart because I heard it was good for zits. So here&#x27;s the horror story part of it all, I had 3 HUGE zits on the left side of my face and 5 HUGE zits on the right. I had one on my chin and 2 on my forehead. I have NEVER had so many GIGANTIC zits at the same time! I was horrified and depressed at my pizza face! I wanted to hide in my room! I&#x27;m a teenager with extremely oily skin. I used it and within 2-3 days, they were gone. it&#x27;s my miracle worker. Proactiv didn&#x27;t work, clearasil didn&#x27;t work, neutrogena didn&#x27;t work, but this baby, it sure did. I will forever buy this product.(: I&#x27;m so happy I found it! I had never tried biore but I&#x27;m so glad that I did. When you wash your face with this, you know it&#x27;s working because you can feel a tingly, refreshing, minty feeling all over your face. It&#x27;s all your pores waking up and being cleaned! This is something you will definatley not be disappointed with!(:</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical because I have sensitive skin, but this product is awesome. It shrunk my pores and evenly toned my skin. I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I used to be able to buy a fantastic Biore pore unclogging face scrub on the highstreet, but they&#x27;ve stopped stocking it, so I went on an online hunt.  On the face of it, this seemed to be the same stuff. It isn&#x27;t.  I have only used this once, and whilst it warms the face and unclogs the pores I am concerned it will be too harsh for my skin.  The old version was much better; mild but extremely effective.  I will have to wait and see if this works out for me, if not, it will be another fantastic product abandoned because of changes to the ingredients that irritate my sensitive skin.  For anyone with sensitive skin, be warned.  Do not use other acne products when you have used this facewash, it will seriously dry out and potentially damage your skin. Be especially careful around your eyes, nose and mouth where your skin is most sensitive.  I really hope this product will be okay for me, and I really hope it works for other people.  I am disappointed that Biore have done what everyone else seems to do; go and change something fantastic that works wonders and ruin it by &#x27;re-formulating&#x27; it! Bad move Biore.</li>
    <li> I use Biore products regularly but for this, worst experience ever. This product smells really bad &amp; leaves my skin smelling the same. Regardless of any possible good or bad results, the smell of the product is unbearable &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t use it even if it works miracles.</li>
    <li> Love this use it at night to get the face nice and clean before bedtime. I use it in the shower. It smells nice and is not over powering. I have sensitive skin and it in gentle yet effective.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to receive a product that doesn&#x27;t look at all like the picture (my tube was green), although the name and description on the bottle is still the same (i.e. &amp;#34;Biore Pore unclogging scrub&amp;#34;).  Still, not thrilled with the product.  Cheap scrub that leaves an oily residue.  I&#x27;m not impressed at all.</li>
