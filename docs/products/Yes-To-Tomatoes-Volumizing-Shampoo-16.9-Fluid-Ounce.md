      <li>, we love it is a good size bottle that will last you a while!</li>
      <li>First was great skin, volume, soft hair.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this out, but to my dismay this product isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t aware of the yeast disorder and most MD doctors will eather not acknowledge candida or are not educated on it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already noted my dissatisfaction with the conditioner in my review there, but wanted to say about this shampoo that I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really clean my scalp well.</li>
      <li>But surprise, my hair is still shiny, full volume</li>
      <li>I would like to have a different scent on this one, but it really leaves my hair feeling great</li>
      <li>The scent is strong, which I don&#x27;t really like, but it does lessen after awhile.  </li>
      <li>Scent is a little strong but it smells good and doesn&#x27;t smell like fruit</li>
      <li>I was on a quest to find a product similar to it, being mostly natural and healthy for my hair while giving amazing volume.</li>
      <li>IT IS ECONOMICAL, IT GOES</li>
      <li>I love that it is a mostly natural product.  </li>
      <li>Love that it is natural.</li>
      <li>Right, everything returned - itchink skin, droping out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I will have to make an appointment with the eye doctor in case it has caused conjunctivitis as my eyes still do not feel right the day after.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle so can be used every day.</li>
      <li>I first saw it at Target, but no stores carry it anymore, and</li>
      <li>This shampoo is more expensive than the Suave (for oily hair) that my husband was using, but it works just as well and for me, that is a total win!</li>
      <li>A LONG WAY MAKING LOTS OF SUDS,  MOST IMPORTANT IT IS NATURAL.  </li>
      <li>It has a soft luxurious lather and rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>i have short, fine hair and this shampoo</li>
      <li>I really like this line.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Really nice shampoo, the only one so far that is able to bring some life in my limp hair.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get much of the volumizing effect that I had hoped for.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t know if I really saw any difference with \\&quot;volume\\</li>
      <li>but my skin becomes very irritated,</li>
      <li>IT IS WAY TO MUCH OF A CHALLENGE .</li>
      <li>I really like this line of hair products.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have been trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my family&#x27;s household and bath products and in a lot of cases the products are more expensive and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
      <li>Decent price.</li>
      <li>, I thought that was normal until I googled and read others nightmares.</li>
      <li>We have tried a few \\&quot;Yes to Tomatoes\\&quot; and \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; products and this one is our favorite by far.</li>
      <li>My hair feels very soft.</li>
      <li>Get the conditioner too its so light and just put it on from the crown down</li>
      <li>I have oily fine hair to the point where it looks like I just got out of the shower after I blow dried my hair ....</li>
      <li>A soft floral aroma but is not perfumy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> All the Yes To products are amazing.  I would like to have a different scent on this one, but it really leaves my hair feeling great so I keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the smell of this product but unfortunately my sensitive skin had issues with all the &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; products I have tried. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the salt or what  but my skin becomes very irritated,</li>
    <li> I had a large tub of expensive salon conditioner to use up and ran out of shampoo.  I chose this shampoo because it was sulfate-free...  It has a soft luxurious lather and rinses clean.  My hair felt soft and not stripped or rough prior to the conditioner being applied...  My hair had great body and seemed thicker...  When I exhaust the salon conditioner, I&#x27;ll try the matching Yes to Tomatoes product...  I like the idea that it has natural compounds and few, if any, chemicals...  Very happy with the results.... I&#x27;m going to ask my husband to give it a try, as well...</li>
    <li> We have tried a few \\&quot;Yes to Tomatoes\\&quot; and \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; products and this one is our favorite by far. Everyone in the house loves it whether they have fine or course hair. I  have fine hair and I don&#x27;t know if I really saw any difference with \\&quot;volume\\&quot; (I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now) but it is a lighter weight shampoo that cleans well and rinses out easily.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fantastic! A soft floral aroma but is not perfumy. No scent of tomatoes lol!&lt;br /&gt;No skin reactions to the scalp on our part, we love it is a good size bottle that will last you a while!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair. I bought this since it had pretty good reviews and was organic in nature. The results weren&#x27;t as expected. I didn&#x27;t get much of the volumizing effect that I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product mainly because when it got into my eyes I can honestly say I have never experienced such pain in my entire life.  It made me scream in agony and I will have to make an appointment with the eye doctor in case it has caused conjunctivitis as my eyes still do not feel right the day after.  The smell is horrible really synthetic and although it dries the hair out to make fine hair less limp it has no better qualities than any other volumising shampoo.  Having read the glowing reviews in a book dealing with anti age products I am disappointed to have spent £10 for something that has to be thrown away.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have oily fine hair to the point where it looks like I just got out of the shower after I blow dried my hair ....but this stuff cleans it so well and isn&#x27;t as harsh as the neutrogena cleansing shampoo, you can use this one everyday and that is just music to my ears! You have to try it because if you&#x27;re living with hair like me and not doing anything about it then you have no idea what you&#x27;re missing! Get the conditioner too its so light and just put it on from the crown down (no need for the scalp) and voila you are amazing!</li>
    <li> All characteristics are really great - smells perfect, nice feeling while washing. My hair became shiny, volumized and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;But after 1 month after using head started to itch awfully.. horrible skin boring with spots on it. Then it became worse - hair started to drop out. It looked like I become bald soon.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t match it with shampoo, but stopped using it. And what? No droping, no itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking, that it had been mistake, I started using shampoo again. First was great skin, volume, soft hair. And what was next? Right, everything returned - itchink skin, droping out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know, what&#x27;s the reason, but I really liked this shampoo at first. I wished I used it with great pleasure, but now - NEVER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo at my sister&#x27;s house and I was hooked. It is simply the best shampoo; it leaves my hair shiny, full and very clean feeling. All other shampoos make my hair limp and wimpy but not Yes to Tomatoes.  I believe that it is better than most shampoos, including the pricey salon products.</li>
    <li> I really like this line of hair products. It smells great and makes my hair quite soft and shiny. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. I have fine hair and this gives it body.  All of their products are great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for close to 5 years and it has been the only shampoo in my shower, I was suffering from a yeast infection called candida for close to 15 years cause of antibiotics including one of the worst antibiotics called tetracycline and I wasn&#x27;t aware of the yeast disorder and most MD doctors will eather not acknowledge candida or are not educated on it and my doctor sent me to dermatologist in which that didn&#x27;t help he over prescribed topical ointments and in my frustrations I researched on internet and learned my diet needed to improve, low carb, excluding dairy for 3-4 years and this shampoo, my scalp was coated in a off white thick pastie like when wet and dry itchie rash when dryer, I thought that was normal until I googled and read others nightmares. Back to review on this shampoo, I have no build up and of course it&#x27;s going to burn eyes if not careful.</li>
    <li> Works okay. Love that it is natural. Great size. Decent price. However it was extremely hard to get out of the bottle. Actually almost impossible. You can unscrew the entire lid to get it out, but it won&#x27;t come out of the opening it is supposed to come out of.</li>
    <li> IT IS ECONOMICAL, IT GOES A LONG WAY MAKING LOTS OF SUDS,  MOST IMPORTANT IT IS NATURAL.  IT HAS LITTLE IF ANY SMELL.  IT DOES ADD VOLUME TO MY HAIR.  IT DOES STING  SOME IF YOU GET IT IN YOUR EYES..  SO THAT NEEDS  TO BE IMPROVED.  ALSO  I HATE THE LID.  IT IS WAY TO MUCH OF A CHALLENGE . JUST PUT ON A SQUIRT OR PUMP LID  AND  MAKE MY LIFE EASIER. PLEASE !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair look great but the smell is really very off putting. I used it with the shampoo and the results were great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got all the minerals and nutrients that hair needs. It smells amazing, in a non-artificial way, and not too overpowering either. Best of all, it cleans/lathers super well and really does volumize hair. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used this with Yes To Tomatoes conditioner. It did not volumize my hair, and left if feeling stripped and dry. No amount of conditioner made it better. I have thin, light hair, and would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Well, I must say that I was very pleased the first time I used it. Shiny, healthy looking and manageable hair without any conditioner! So I waited after the 3rd time it to see if it would pass the test. I dye my hair since I&#x27;m 20 and I&#x27;m 49 now. But surprise, my hair is still shiny, full volume and it&#x27;s probably hair color friendly because I had many compliments. I&#x27;m very pleased with this shampoo and will order again. The smell is also very pleasant. I used Redken, Paul Mitchell, Sebastian, etc. but I never had nice hair like with tomatoes shampoo. Great!</li>
    <li> After Burt&#x27;s Bees stupidly changed their formula (WHY OH WHY DO COMPANIES DO THIS?) I was on a quest to find a product similar to it, being mostly natural and healthy for my hair while giving amazing volume. I finally found it! This product is amazing. It leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy and with great volume! I&#x27;ve tried many other products and they always ended up leaving my hair feeling stripped, dry, and dull. This one doesn&#x27;t disappoint! Thank you Yes to Tomatoes, I am hooked. Now PLEASE don&#x27;t change your formula, it&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
    <li> I felt an immediate difference in my hair from the time I was washing the shampoo out of my hair. Scent is a little strong but it smells good and doesn&#x27;t smell like fruit so I like it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the cap/lid/or whatever you call it. It sucks. I could not squeeze it out. I had to remove the top. As we speak, I am looking for a something on Amazon to replace it and make it easier to use. Will update if successful.</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be the best shampoo for oily hair that the &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; brand makes.  It does nothing for oily hair.  Also, the smell is overwhelming.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does dry my hair out a bit. Though I believe it&#x27;s because I use really hot water or just because my wavey hair is dry to begin with. The conditioner fixes the dry effects. I use them together. but maybe I&#x27;ll try one of their other Shampoos..</li>
    <li> i love the smell of this shampoo! i have short, fine hair and this shampoo gives it a bit of a boost and leaves it clean and healthy feeling. my hair feels less &amp;#34;sludgy&amp;#34; than it does when i use other brands.</li>
    <li> It does what it says!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now, and it has added volume to my hair plus it looks healthier and shiny.  Great for fine or thin hair, and smells great!  Packaging problem:  When I received this the package was damaged and 1/4 of one of the bottles had been drained out. I did call Amazon and the refunded part of the purchase price, plus put a credit on my store card.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I just got my package and inside there was only one item, one shampoo, not two shampoos as it shows...</li>
    <li> I have been using Dove conditioners for years! I found this product online and wanted to give it try considering its almost all-natural... It works alright.. you definitely require a whole lot, as compared to Dove conditioners, for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would order it again as it has way less chemicals than other conditioners and it works just fine on my hair.</li>
    <li> The ingredients list is incomplete on the product description.  If you need to avoid stearyl alcohol, this is NOT the product for you.  Also, it has a REALLY strong perfume-y fragrance that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, oily-prone hair, and I LOVE this shampoo. It smells great, it&#x27;s light, and it makes my hair really soft and shiny without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s so hard to find! I first saw it at Target, but no stores carry it anymore, and even the Yes To website doesn&#x27;t carry it. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon still has it, and I hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
    <li> My wife wrote this review:&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is a great compliment to the [[ASIN:B003PL2CQQ Yes To Volumizing Conditioner, Tomatoes, 16.9 Fluid Ounce]] It lathers nicely and smells pleasant - not like tomatoes.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo at TJMAX and I love it. It&#x27;s foams and smells very good. It&#x27;s very gentle so can be used every day. My hair feels very soft.</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning slightly on top and I bought this product after others haven&#x27;t worked.  This product worked for me and I plan to purchase the volumizing conditioner now.</li>
    <li> I wanted shampoo without any chemicals, so I bought this one. The smell is nice, but it makes me sneeze a lot, and it burns eyes so bad, I never had eyes burning problem with any shampoo before, just this one. About result on hair nothing to say, not shiny and not silk and no promise volume at all.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my family&#x27;s household and bath products and in a lot of cases the products are more expensive and don&#x27;t work as well. This shampoo is more expensive than the Suave (for oily hair) that my husband was using, but it works just as well and for me, that is a total win! The scent is nice, it lathers well and it helps take care of his oily hair.</li>
    <li> It smells great. I like the way it feels washing my hair too but the actual bottle has a very small odd shaped hole to squirt the product out of. It took me several squeezes/ squirts to get enough on my hands. I think they should change the top on it. It made my hair feel thicker and cleaner. Like a clarifying shampoo does after you use it.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I have thin, easily electrified hair. This shampoo gives sufficient and it reduced hair loss.</li>
    <li> Really nice shampoo, the only one so far that is able to bring some life in my limp hair. Too bad about the flacon, which is large and heavy and doesn&#x27;t let the shampoo get out easy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for christmas and she used every bit of it. She loves organic volumizing shampoo and found this one to be perfect! She says that it works great.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this out, but to my dismay this product isn&#x27;t for me. I have curly, usually frizzy hair and this shampoo just makes the frizz worse. I&#x27;m probably going to use it until it&#x27;s gone because I really don&#x27;t want to waste it, but it&#x27;s NOT worth the price and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this line. See my review under conditioner for more in depth information on the three Yes to Carrots product lines...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any volume improvement after using the Yes To Tomatoes shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve already noted my dissatisfaction with the conditioner in my review there, but wanted to say about this shampoo that I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really clean my scalp well. The morning after I&#x27;ve washed it, my scalp will be greasy (while the ends are dry) and that means I had to start washing daily... which is bad for my hair. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> The scent is strong, which I don&#x27;t really like, but it does lessen after awhile.  I personally love the way my hair feels after using this though.  It feels thicker and bouncier.</li>
    <li> I love that it is a mostly natural product.  It smells very good, in my opinion, and seems to do a good job volumizing my hair.</li>
