<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> stones fell out...poorly made.</li>
    <li> I thought the stones would be smaller but my girls loved them just as they are!</li>
    <li> Very cheap broke within two weeks</li>
    <li> Nice like the double loop.</li>
    <li> love it love it love it !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as cute as in the advertizement but it gets the job done.  I thought that I was getting a good deal because the really cute ones at the store sell for $5.99 and up but this does not look cute.  It is a good material band but the design is like something a 5 year old would make.  No offense.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this headband. Great quality..especially for the price!! I would definitely purchase this again. I get so many compliments on this headband!</li>
    <li> Seriously love this head band I have bought three more! It&#x27;s amazing quality it feels great on your head I absolutely love the design and the fact that it&#x27;s not cheaply made! Gotten so many compliments and everyone that seen it absolutely falls in love with it and asks where I got it. Plus my shipping was superfast will totally be buying from this carrier again!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Looks so cute.</li>
    <li> After three uses the elastic was out stretched and no longer fits my head</li>
    <li> great price, beautiful and was delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Really really pretty!!</li>
    <li> Looks cheap - Not what I thought. I also didn&#x27;t like the packaging.</li>
    <li> I use this to create the easy princess roll and just to use as a headband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work retail and I get countless compliments on this headband. I would recommend to everyone. Really sturdy too.</li>
    <li> Obsessed! I love it so much!</li>
    <li> just the right fit gorgeous!!</li>
    <li> I love this headband, it&#x27;s cute... But I thought it was a little thicker... It&#x27;s really thin... &amp; it took forever to come in?</li>
    <li> Very well made , fit well and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Good price but looks like really expensive headbands I saw at a boutique but looks just like them..really cute and good quality</li>
    <li> Have gotten many compliments on this headband, so cute n comfy!</li>
    <li> beautiful -I love this</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
    <li> Wow, I feel in love with this head band when I saw it on line and even more so when I received it! The band itself is constructed well and each crystal is perfectly sized and securely attached. My daughter has light brown hair and this band looks amazing in contrast to her hair color. She has worn it about 30 times and it has kept it shape and elasticity. I only wish it came in differs colors I would buy them all!</li>
    <li> It fit perfect the only thing is that u have to because of detail on top overall I am happy with it  and yes guys u can buy this product u won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> Stretched after second wear</li>
    <li> not as i would have expected but works ok</li>
    <li> Pretty headband and nothing has fallen off with repeated use. Elasticity seems to hold in band too.</li>
    <li> I have bought this headband several times and for several people. Almost every time I wear it I get compliments on how nice it looks. It is loose enough that it doesn&#x27;t give me headaches, but tight enough to stay on my head. The beads do start to come off after awhile, but you definitely get your money out of it before that happens.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful for cheap price! Wears well, and doesn&#x27;t hurt my head!</li>
    <li> Fits great!  Looks just as described!</li>
    <li> Really pretty and fit perfect!y</li>
    <li> beautiful, and it fits great, I will buy another band, its so sparky</li>
    <li> Loves this. I get lots of compliments when I wear it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful fit.  Love this head band</li>
    <li> I love this headband. It is so comfortable and looks so chic!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful, dressy hair band true as pictured.  For the small amount I paid, it is made quite well.  I only had one problem with it - it was too tight for my head, so I altered the stretch.  I encircled it around a tin box I had in the house (similar to a hat box) and kept it there for a month.  When I took it off, the elastic had relaxed enough not to hurt my head.  I got many compliments on this when I recently wore it to a wedding (as a guest).  It took about one month to arrive from China (the seller) so if you have somewhere in mind you want to wear it, order today..</li>
    <li> Not very good quality. Arrived with two of the beads off. I had to glue them back on. Wasn&#x27;t worth postage to mail it back.</li>
    <li> So cute, good quality.</li>
    <li> Very pretty headband.</li>
    <li> I got my daughter this just to make the cart balance $35.It is alot more than I expected, she loves it. It is exactly what the picture shows, but even more beautiful in person. The headband fits perfectly, but her head does have a smaller diameter. It is very versatile and can go with practically any outfit she wears. It is fancy, blingy, and cute all at once.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful headband.</li>
    <li> I like when my significant other wears this.</li>
    <li> I love this headband.  Looks great!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s perfect. Just like the picture. Thanks</li>
    <li> pulls my hair but it is cute</li>
    <li> I wear mine all the time !! It&#x27;s looks just like the picture!!!</li>
    <li> Cute! I get compliments on it too! Makes me feel a little more pulled together when I just throw my hair up in a bun.</li>
    <li> Love these. Bought a few. Great value!</li>
    <li> I had this awesome headband for just over a week. I really LOVED it. and then it broke. :- (</li>
    <li> Took a while to come in the mail, but its absolutely gorgeous. it doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair. The band is super stretchy and fits like a charm</li>
    <li> Much better than expected. Will buy more in the future. The shipping did take a while but it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> love how it looks but wish it had a bit more stretch...kinda keeps sliding off my head &amp; won&#x27;t stay put where I want it</li>
    <li> cute and stylish. i got alot of compliments from people when i wear it. also very easy to style</li>
    <li> Looks like it came from a boutique!</li>
    <li> Beautiful! I always get lots if compliments.</li>
    <li> cute. a piece came missing of the little diamonds but whatever it was like 1 dollar and it still is cute</li>
    <li> This is very cute and decently prices. I bought several headbands as a group and this was included. It is soft. Doesn&#x27;t slip often. I have a small to average sized head with thick hair. It is not too tight. I like it because it adds a lot of bling to any outfit/look. Would recommend to anyone wanting something affordable and cute.</li>
    <li> Did not even give me the right item! Unbelievable! Instead I received a peacock pin. Very dissapinted and I don&#x27;t know how to return it because it is from Hong Kong</li>
    <li> i love it i would buy it again</li>
    <li> Arrived yesterday - earlier than expected!  Love it, love it!!!</li>
    <li> I loved this headband until the 2nd time I wore it and it broke at work. It was super cute and fit well but not worth the money. Not to mention this is the second headband I&#x27;ve got from this company and they both broke within a week from buying them!! Cute but cheap and useless.</li>
    <li> It broke the first day my daughter wore it!</li>
    <li> AWFUL QUALITY!!! the stones were already coming apart when i opened the package. Glue was in the inner part of the band that would touch the hair. Unable to wear. I will never buy again form this vendor. First time Ive been disappointed with something.</li>
    <li> love this and get complements on it all the time!</li>
    <li> Loved this and fast shipping thanks</li>
    <li> Love! totally worth the small amount of money</li>
    <li> I get SO many compliments everytime I wear it. I wear it in the hippie style, like a fore-head band and it looks really good with anything you wear. High quality product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a headband that actually stays on my head.  It&#x27;s cute and fits well!</li>
    <li> Dont but this,  waste of  your money.</li>
    <li> Broke the first time I wore it.</li>
    <li> Gets caught in my hair and hurts when it is removed! Like getting my HEAD waxed!!!!</li>
    <li> The glue came undone when it was in the heat for too long. Other than that it is fine.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected and super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Love it!  But it broke within two weeks.  The elastic pulled out. :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too stretched out</li>
    <li> Just beautiful, not too tight. I am an adult, love it</li>
    <li> this was a gift for a girl who used it for her prom, but it is good for everyday too</li>
    <li> im giving this a three because however i did get it in soon, but after 3 days of owning it.. it broke..</li>
    <li> Very cute, but get stuck in my hair</li>
    <li> It is nice looks good but it is very loose, doen&#x27;t stand well in my head</li>
    <li> Love mine.  Some came loose but I used a fabric glue for the price, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful. I receive many compliments on this piece.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but not as shiny and pretty as the picture, that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. It&#x27;s is dressy though but not formal dressy. I am hoping it loosens a little over time cause it wants to pop off if I don&#x27;t leave my hair down and wear it.</li>
    <li> One of the big stones fell out onthe first wear, but these are like $18 everywhere in town so whatever.</li>
    <li> Love it ,fits well . Looks just like the pic</li>
    <li> Super happy with it! Comfortable &amp; cute &amp; recieved it before expected date. Looks just like the picture :)</li>
    <li> Fits my head very well when most headbands slide back over time!</li>
    <li> Broke after wearing it twice.</li>
    <li> I have a long hair to the waist, go traveling, shopping, home, work time I took it, very nice, in my it seems that there is a little retro feel.</li>
    <li> The elastic is too short.</li>
    <li> Great fit &amp; it doesn&#x27;t fall off!!!</li>
    <li> Came kinda broken, wasn&#x27;t too bad though</li>
    <li> This headband is so elegant I received so many compliments the first time I wore it, i work as a hostess at a restaurant so this added a little spark to my boring black dress, i swear i felt like a princess because it resembles a tiara. I ordered by mistake two of them but I don&#x27;t mind it&#x27;s going to make a great gift for one of my cousins lol I definitely recommend it to anybody who&#x27;s interested in adding a little va va voom to your hair.</li>
    <li> Super cute and a GREAT deal for this kind of headband.  I get lots of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and full of bling! If you are a DIVA this headband is exactly what you&#x27;re after! I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cute and I&#x27;ve got a bunch of compliments</li>
    <li> Beautiful headband , mine stretched out a bit ,it could have a  stronger hold with bobby pins though</li>
    <li> stays in place , very nice</li>
    <li> I love this head band. Very nice and would recommend this to anyone. Very reasonable and cheap price for head band .</li>
    <li> Headband is very stretched out. So its impossible to wear just falls off.</li>
    <li> Very cute and looks just like the picture</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece and isn&#x27;t too tight.  Can wear it dressed up or down.  I love it and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Fab deal and super cute!</li>
    <li> VERY PRETTY AND VERY COMFORTABLE. EASY TO PUT ON, TAKE OFF, AND NO TANGLES IN THE HAIR WHICH IS ALSO NICE. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> fell apart on first use</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here or when it got here it was shotty workmanship and has fallen apart twice</li>
    <li> Love this headband. I was afraid at first that it would be too small for my head, since I have ordered other headbands from Asia before and they tend to be a bit smaller, but the fit is perfect. I get compliments every time I wear it. The width was thinner than I was expecting, but still looks super cute.</li>
    <li> I ordered this headband about a month ago and it finally reached to me. I absolutely love it! If they had some other color i would get it too. Its not to tight and looks really pretty on my brunet hair. I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Very cute and well made for the cheap cost.  Shipped quickly too</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting</li>
    <li> I was happy with all aspects of this purchase!</li>
    <li> Adorable I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Looks great on.</li>
    <li> This is such an adorable headband. It&#x27;s very good quality. When I buy items like this, I&#x27;m always worried that they&#x27;re going to break the second I put them on, but this one is great. It&#x27;s a little tight on me, but otherwise, definitely worth getting— so cute.</li>
    <li> Absolutely stunning!!!  Not to tight for my head, usually I can&#x27;t stand anything around my head for any length of time,&lt;br /&gt;But I had no problem wearing this beautiful head band with no pressure all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order another ASAP! Great Buy.</li>
    <li> it was really cute and i really liked it but i wore it once and the twice time i wore it it pop right off of my head</li>
    <li> QUICK shipping but child size, not adult size.</li>
    <li> I have a big head and it actually fits well. I was surprised.</li>
    <li> The headband is very pretty and I was quite pleased with it. I had seen one like it at a local store that was far more expensive.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get it and stones  pop off easy! Be careful wearing near water exp rain it makes the stones come off</li>
    <li> Cheap!!! Its like a string with beads on it. I gave it to my niece. She loves it, shes 6 so its great for her.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOOOOOVE THIS! when I got it out of the package I was like oh my im not gonna like this but I put it on and its so cute. and definitely sturdy.</li>
    <li> It broke the first time putting it on my head</li>
    <li> Looks just like pic and looks great on my daughter. Very pretty.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s comfy and big enough for my head!</li>
    <li> Nice but not as flawless as the picture - a few stray threads, but overall it is very comfortable and cute. Perfect for a swing dancer&#x27;s costume!</li>
    <li> Really cute. The only issue I have with it is that it kind of slides backwards on my head after a while.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase...it&#x27;s my new favorite.  A very good buy for the money.  I have seen simiar hairbands selling for much more, and I hesitated to spend $15 - $20.  This was a real find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter. It came on time. She loves it.  I gave it a four star, because you have to be careful when putting it in your hair, because sometimes the beads get stuck in your hair.</li>
    <li> This is super cute and it was a great price. Love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this headband! I love how it&#x27;s so cheap yet just as good as those headbands over $10. In fact, I think it&#x27;s better. My previous expensive headbands have torn up but this one is still going strong!</li>
    <li> This is soo pretty! They fit is perfect. Its not too tight on my head but its not so lose that it falls off.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this fancy headband. A little big for her but she&#x27;s only four. Takes awhile to be delivered but for the price no complaints!</li>
    <li> The only downside to this headband is that it came from China, and took a while to ship. It was worth the wait though, because I absolutely love it! This is the only headband like this that actually stays on my head. It is very comfortable, and very pretty. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> the quality could be much better!But it was prity</li>
    <li> I love this!!! I get so many compliments</li>
    <li> Most elastic head bands slide right off my head but this one is perfect! Its super cute and doesn&#x27;t look cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;Great price too!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my head size. Great design and super stylish on the head.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best head bands ive purchased! It has like felt in the back of the gems so it doesnt get caught and yank all your hair out! Price wasnt bad either! I wear it allll the time!!!!</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail today. Took it out the package and there were already rin</li>
    <li> A must buy for anyone who loves headbands! Good quality and beautifully made!</li>
    <li> very please, just a described, better in person. my daughter has discovered the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s (she is 13) and has decided she wants to grow up to be a &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34;. She was extremely pleased!</li>
    <li> I like them but the beading keeps falling off. I&#x27;ve went through 2 already.</li>
    <li> i love this&lt;br /&gt;its so cute! and it looks really fancy! i seen the same exact one at charlotte russe for like 12 bucks!&lt;br /&gt;so you might as well get this one! its way cheaper!</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend, she loved it, wears it alot, just sayin...</li>
    <li> Backside is a little itchy, but it&#x27;s super cute. I get lots of compliments when I wear this headband.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Worn several times and still holds up great.  It doesn&#x27;t bother my head or tight at all. Great buy for the price and style.</li>
    <li> Great headband.  Gorgeous, feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Stretchy but still tight fitting. Stays in my hair great and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache. Great sparkle without being overwhelming o scratchy. Doesn&#x27;t catch my hair at all. Velvet keeps the band in place comfortably. Took a long time to ship, but worth the price if you arent in a rush</li>
    <li> Headband is pretty but it is kinda big for my head. It fits on my head but it&#x27;s loose.</li>
    <li> fit great, looks good</li>
    <li> So Cute, I love it. Although I wish it was a bit more comfortable after wearing it for a while.</li>
    <li> Received right on time!! It looks just like the picture shown and the jems on it are nice and sparkly!! It&#x27;s a very cute headband, defiantly worth buying.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this headband! So far it&#x27;s held up really well, not like others that stretch out the first time you wear it. It&#x27;s really strong and fits snug in the back (how I like it so I know it will stay), but it&#x27;s not so tight on your head that it hurts.</li>
    <li> It is just as described. It looks beautiful any way you use it ! It is even perfect for the tuck into headband style! I am going to buy in different colors also.</li>
