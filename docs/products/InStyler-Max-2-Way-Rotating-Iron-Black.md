      <li>/&gt;It seemed good in theory</li>
      <li>This is a very nice rotating iron which has some nice features and works well.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I love my 2-way InStyler!  </li>
      <li>easy to handle, great</li>
      <li>an excellent large comb, heat-resistant pad, and readable instruction manual</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, THIS PRODUCT is amazing.</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s a nice bit of lift to the finish.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair frizzy and my ends don&#x27;t get a nice finish.</li>
      <li>This also comes with a nice comb.  </li>
      <li>This comes with a number of nice features.  </li>
      <li>In theory, this InStyler Rotating Iron seems like a good and easy way to do so, but I can’t figure it out.</li>
      <li>My most popular in demand service was hair straightening.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair, so for me the InStyler worked best at straightening my hair and also at giving it softer curls.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been so EASY!</li>
      <li>The Instyler is the perfect iron to use if you are poking for a more voluminous and natural style.</li>
      <li>I love the dual rotating barrel, very easy to use on both sides of the head.</li>
      <li>iron looks elegant and is very easy to use</li>
      <li>The instructions are very detailed.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get more out of it, and avoid burns and scorches.</li>
      <li>This also comes with a heat resistant counter top mat.</li>
      <li>I would say watch these, as they are brief/to the point, and there is no substitute for being able to follow along with demonstrated motions.  </li>
      <li>You should not be working more than 2&amp;#34; width of hair and keep the hair</li>
      <li>I appreciate the unit&#x27;s versatility; you can curl, straighten, flip out, flip in, boost  volume (my favorite), and just get poofy in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Additionally my daughter tried it out on her straight shoulder length hair and she got great results both for smoothing and curling hers.</li>
      <li>This is a phenomenal hairstyling gadget that can work as either a hair straightener or  curler.  </li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>With its ability to curl, straighten, wave, and add body and shine most women who care about how their hair looks will love this product that will save them money and time with fewer trips to the hairdresser.</li>
      <li>might have gotten better results if someone else was doing my hair, but how does that save me time?</li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product...</li>
      <li>It was okay just didn&#x27;t like the noise, I returned it.</li>
      <li>I love that.</li>
      <li>Love this, saves time in morning.  </li>
      <li>Possibly this works best for people who have a lot of skill with curling irons and straighteners already.</li>
      <li>This product does what it says and more.  </li>
      <li>Supposedly you are able to get the ends of your hair curled up as well at the bottom, but it might take a bit of practice to get that done.</li>
      <li>Curling results also come out great and this is where the benefits of the rotating barrel really shines through.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an excellently designed styler; a simple turn of the knob is convenient for switching between left-handed and right-handed, hassle-free styling.</li>
      <li>but it takes more work and with figuring out</li>
      <li>Most stylers would burn my hair and make it frizzy but this one did not.</li>
      <li>Also, what makes this a great rotating iron is that it rotates both ways making it much easier to style your hair, rather than just one way.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>Straightening results are excellent with nice shine and unlike typical straightening irons</li>
      <li>It works great for my natural 3c - 4b hair types.</li>
      <li>It curls easier and faster than her old curling iron too, which is great for everyone for lessening the waiting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is good, but doesn&#x27;t create as much as a flip as I would like.</li>
      <li>The manual provides the address to that site, so it is easy to find.</li>
      <li>It heats up lightning fast, is comfortable to use and comes with a good amount of documentation and accessories (like a guard to prevent burning fingers, and a burn-proof pad to put on your counter top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It heats up to your setting in under a minute and is easy to use without tugging or pulling on hair.</li>
      <li>I need a hair appliance that is easy to use for tough-ups and on the go ease.</li>
      <li>The rotating barrel makes it so easy to use.</li>
      <li>it worked best if I used it on slightly damp hair.  </li>
      <li>It is light and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This is light and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m fine with that</li>
      <li>Since the only correct way to straighten is with roller brush and heat, this is very impressive tool to do exactly that, continuously roiling the hair with heat.  </li>
      <li>The handle is comfortable and ergonomic which helps since this process takes a while.  </li>
      <li>and sometimes I went it smooth.</li>
      <li>, I wasn&#x27;t able to get it to really curl despite watching every tutorial available on youtube&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it gave me so much static</li>
      <li>The handle is comfortable and ergonomic which helps since this process takes a while.  </li>
      <li>The curling iron is well built and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
      <li>drill sound</li>
      <li>It does get pretty hot, so watch where you are placing your fingers, as I got a couple good burns.  </li>
      <li>I suspect that we’ll – more like she’ll – learn how to use it, but right now we’re inconclusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll never emerge with salon-like hair after using this, but it&#x27;s a very useful tool, given the combination of features.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, quick and didn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is well made, heats up quickly, and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The instructions are easy to read and come with pictures which do a good job explaining how to properly use this.</li>
      <li>It also heats up very quickly, and it is quicker and easier to use than a regular iron once you get in a good amount of practice with it.</li>
      <li>When you feel comfortable using the styler you wait until the unit is cool and pop the training aid off the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>InStyler also provides a cool tip that you can screw into the end of the styler to help prevent burning your fingers as you use the InStyler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, my hair kept getting tangled on the cool tip</li>
      <li>I am not the most patient person when getting ready for my day</li>
      <li>Use the cool tip thing on the end and save yourself some grief.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>good overall.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Had this for over 6 weeks and my wife still uses it every morning over her $300 straightener.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a relative. She&#x27;s very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice rotating iron which has some nice features and works well. It is light and easy to use.  This comes with a number of nice features.  It comes with 2-way auto-rotation which allows you to rotate the iron toward the end of your hair. It has Black Tourmaline Ceramic &amp; Ionic Bristles that seem to make the heat distribute evenly.  This has four heat settings.  Low heat is 285 degrees. Medium heat is 315 degrees. High heat is 383 degrees. Max heat is 425 degrees.  This also comes with a heat resistant counter top mat. It also has a safety shut-off in case this is accidently left on.  This comes with a Thermal Guard  training aid which is recommended for use when you are first getting used to this iron.  It is supposed to protect hair from burns.  The instructions are easy to read and come with pictures which do a good job explaining how to properly use this. This also comes with a nice comb.  This is light and easy to use.  It does a great job shaping hair. The instructions are very helpful.</li>
    <li> I love this. It works great for my natural 3c - 4b hair types. I&#x27;ve even used it on the second out of 4 heat setting to get a blow out look. The first time I used it on blown out hair and used the hottest heat and only needed 2 passes. I had no heat damage either time using it. Also no fried hair smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this since it first came out. Got it for Christmas and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  Good feeling gone.  I have long thin hair, which I wear either wavy or slightly curly. I currently use a Conair Hot Air brush to add volume while I dry, then put it into curlers while it cools, but it doesn&#x27;t work if I wait too long and it air dries. I thought the In-Styler would allow me to air dry and style after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st, I couldn&#x27;t get my hair around the rod with the heat shield on so I had to remove it and immediately burned myself.&lt;br /&gt;2nd, my hair kept getting tangled on the cool tip (no matter what I did) and, at one point, lost a small chunk.&lt;br /&gt;3rd, it smelled like it was burning my hair so I turned it down but then it had no affect at all.&lt;br /&gt;4th, I wasn&#x27;t able to get it to really curl despite watching every tutorial available on youtube&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it gave me so much static that I looked like I was conducting a science experiment on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to try the new Conair Infiniti Pro Hot Air Spin Brush instead.  I&#x27;ll write a review once I&#x27;ve had a chance to try it out.</li>
    <li> I have thick straight hair halfway to my waist, which has never held wave or curl for more than a few hours. Although the InStyler excels in straightening hair and increasing  volume, I was more interested in creating waves and loose curls (as well as flip-under and flip-up effects) which would hold for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly enough, the InStyler was quite successful in doing so, although the learning curve was greater than I wished, and I still hesitate to use it even after several weeks, for fear of burning my fingers. Of the four settings, the hottest temperature setting  - best for long thick hair – is 425 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the Instyler, I was intimidated by its size, the various pieces included in the kit, and the instructions, and did not use it immediately. However after viewing half a dozen of the videos about using it at myinstyler.com I gained enough confidence to try. There are about 20 2-3 minutes videos there on such topics as Fine or Short Hair, Flip In, Making Soft Curls, Installing the Thermal Guard etc. At Youtube, there are even more videos demonstrating various  curling, straightening and volume enhancing techniques geared specifically to short, long, fine or thick hair. I highly suggest watching those relevant to you before using InStyler, so that you do not burn yourself or are unhappy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The optional thermal guard attachment which helps you avoid burning your fingers can also catch and tangle your hair, so you may choose not to use it. I snapped it on initially but removed it after several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the videos and included instruction manual clearly explain and/or demonstrate a variety of InStyler techniques, and many Amazon reviews also provide how-to tips for different hairstyles, I will not do so here. Instead I will indicate what I like (a lot) and don&#x27;t like about InStyler, and provide a few hints I&#x27;ve learned about using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES: POSITIVE&lt;br /&gt;--takes only 30-40 seconds to heat up, and provides 3 heat settings&lt;br /&gt;--consists of an automatic rotating barrel and several brushes which keep the hair soft and smooth as they straighten, increase volume or curl&lt;br /&gt;--includes an excellent large comb, heat-resistant pad, and readable instruction manual&lt;br /&gt;--the 1 ½ inch barrel is just the right size for loose curls&lt;br /&gt;--has a thermal attachment to help you avoid burning your fingers&lt;br /&gt;--has an automatic shut-off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVANTAGES&lt;br /&gt;--keeps hair soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;--does not tangle your hair (except occasionally when you use the thermal protection)&lt;br /&gt;--has superb results creating waves with long thick hair&lt;br /&gt;--most people can completely style their hair in about 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;--your styling result holds for several days&lt;br /&gt;--can be used to straighten or curl hair, and to increase volume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CRITICISMS&lt;br /&gt;-- No storage bag is provided.&lt;br /&gt;--The drill sound the Instyler makes when in use is too loud - unlikely to please a sleeping partner or nearby roommate.&lt;br /&gt;--Anyone who had a rotator cuff or upper arm injury might find (as I did) that raising their arm to hold the large InStyler up for 10 seconds at a time on a dozen or more sections of hair at the back of the head can be difficult and painful. Since I have had rotator cuff injuries and cramps in both upper arms, I find that styling long back hair is difficult and painful, especially near the back of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUGGESTIONS FOR USE&lt;br /&gt;-- First, watch the videos that are relevant to you&lt;br /&gt;-- Start with dry or only slightly damp clean untangled hair that you have just brushed&lt;br /&gt;-- Pin up clumps of your hair so you can work on your hair in sections&lt;br /&gt;-- Give yourself at least half an hour the first few times you use it&lt;br /&gt;-- Although the highest setting for long thick hair is the hottest, use the medium setting and&lt;br /&gt; take additional time if you are uncomfortable with the intensity of heat&lt;br /&gt;-- Be very careful not to burn your fingers&lt;br /&gt;-- Go very slow, spending at least 7-10 seconds on each section, and hesitating for a second more at the end of your hair&lt;br /&gt;-- Gently your hold each hair section up for a second or two after styling it to allow it to set&lt;br /&gt;-- If creating beachy waves or loose curls, alternate the direction to which you rotate the brush or twist your hair so that your curls fall both out and under, both left and right&lt;br /&gt;-- Don&#x27;t brush or comb hard when done, but rather use your fingers to fluff up your hair and separate any clumps&lt;br /&gt;-- Enjoy the new you!ir section up for a second or two after styling it to allow it to set -- If creating beachy waves or loose curls, alternate the direction to which you rotate the brush or twist your hair so that your curls fall both out and under, both left and right -- Don&#x27;t brush or comb hard when done, but rather use your fingers to fluff up your hair and separate any clumps  -- Enjoy the new you!</li>
    <li> The product worked great but I&#x27;m concerned with burning my hair and this made my hair feel rough afterwards. I had the iron on the medium setting and my hair silk smelted burnt when I washed it two days later.</li>
    <li> BAD ONE. NOT GOOD AT ALL.</li>
    <li> So much better than the other models of InStyler.  I had so much trouble doing the left side of my head because the other models would only turn one way.  This one turns both ways.  Makes it so much easier to get the friz out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work, however the brush portion bristles are too stiff and yanked and pulled my hair. I&#x27;ve stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair and enjoy being versatile with my hair styles. Sometimes I want my hair wavy and sometimes I went it smooth. The InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron, Black can create both of those looks with one appliance. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool has a rotating barrel with a clamp that has brushes. The two pieces together work to keep each strand of hair soft and separated as it heats them, unlike the old-fashioned curling irons that heat a section together in a way that has the strands kind of sticking to each other. The effect is a softer, more natural look for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InStyler Max isn&#x27;t hard to use, but I do recommend watching the instructional videos on their website to get an idea of how to use it before starting. The manual provides the address to that site, so it is easy to find. InStyler has videos for several different types of styling, so most people will find a video to help with the look they are trying to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the InStyler Max mostly to smooth my hair and it work wonderfully. I have used it to curl my hair, but have found that the [[ASIN:B00KOJ9008 InStyler Ionic Styler Pro Ionic Hot Brush and Ceramic Flat Iron, Purple]] is easier for me to use when I want to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device heats up quickly and also has an automated shut off so you needn&#x27;t worry too much if you forget to turn it off. There are three heat settings designed for different types of hair. InStyler also provides a cool tip that you can screw into the end of the styler to help prevent burning your fingers as you use the InStyler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the InStyler Max.</li>
    <li> With nearly instant heatup, and about two rotations per second, this multi-rotational iron offers consistent styling options for luxurious curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellently designed styler; a simple turn of the knob is convenient for switching between left-handed and right-handed, hassle-free styling.</li>
    <li> This InSttler Max 2-Way Rotating Styler works well on my daughter&#x27;s and wife&#x27;s hair. My daughter uses it as a straightener and my wife uses it to add volume. Both of them preferred the rotating area over standard flat irons, since they can leave hair looking &amp;#34;limp&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is well made, heats up quickly, and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> This iron does take a while to figure out how to use properly/efficiently, but once you finally get it down, it does do a terrific job. My wife says it&#x27;s the nicest/best iron she&#x27;s ever used. She says it quickly styles her hair just the way she likes it, makes her hair very shiny, silky, bouncy, and unlike her last iron, this iron also leaves her hair frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron is obviously somewhat expensive, but it does feel and appear to be extremely well made. It also heats up very quickly, and it is quicker and easier to use than a regular iron once you get in a good amount of practice with it. There&#x27;s definitely a learning curve with operating this iron, so be patient with it. You will eventually get operating it down, and when you do, I think you&#x27;re quite likely to be very pleased with the results. My wife says she&#x27;s very happy with this iron. So give it a try. I think the chances are good you&#x27;ll be very happy with it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about this rotating iron, please feel free to ask, and I&#x27;ll try my best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful.</li>
    <li> My hair seems to be on an up and down cycle of curly or straight. The longer it gets, though, means it keeps going straight, just because the weight of it pulls it down. If I twirl it up while it is still wet, it will come down in curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great styler for my hair. With 4 heat settings, I can heat it up pretty high and curl faster. Most stylers would burn my hair and make it frizzy but this one did not. For some reason it did not damage my hair in the way that I might have expected. It was just shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on this brush are just ideal. They have a softness to them that means they won’t catch or pull my hair. I love that.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very straight and soft</li>
    <li> My experience with this product was so-so. Now, it needs to be said that I have a ghd Gold Professional straightener (for everyday use) and a T3 one (for travel). I invested in each of these to protect my hair against damage (as a much as possible). Since I have long, mildly wavy hair, I only need a quick pass for it to be poker-straight ... so this InStyler feels a bit like overkill for someone with hair like me. My hair came out straight and looked really nice, but the process seemed excessive and my hair seemed less lustrous after the next wash.  I think this could be very effective for those with extremely unruly hair. But, for those with a slight wave, it simply isn&#x27;t necessary (and truly seems to overwork the hair ... which could lead to split ends, lack of shine, breakage, and various other damage). Purchase accordingly.</li>
    <li> Well, the reality is that we haven’t figured out how to use this well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It doesn’t seem to do much when applied to my wife’s hair, but she isn’t much on gadgetry to begin with. A blow dryer sems to be all she needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The unit seems durable. But  we’ve found it difficult, in a way, to figure out quite what it or we should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So for the moment, we are neither positive nor negative: just curious. I suspect that we’ll – more like she’ll – learn how to use it, but right now we’re inconclusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is easier to use than a flat iron.  Smoothes my hair straight or I can get great beach curls!!</li>
    <li> This Instyler Max is wife approved! She has been using this and is now her go to tool, she said it feels like a straightener, you use it like a straightener but it curls! It curls easier and faster than her old curling iron too, which is great for everyone for lessening the waiting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Wife recommended!</li>
    <li> The Instyler is the perfect iron to use if you are poking for a more voluminous and natural style. The rotating barrel makes it so easy to use. This product is very similar to other irons -- I was able to straighten, curl and wave my hair while using it. Also, what makes this a great rotating iron is that it rotates both ways making it much easier to style your hair, rather than just one way. A con I discovered while trying this was that I was a little difficult to use with the bristled brush because of my thick hair, if I had thin hair it would have been the perfect styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 4/5 stars</li>
    <li> What a waste of money!!! I am so disappointed that it did not work at all on my hair.  Very expensive.  And no improvements whatsoever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a curling iron.  It&#x27;s a straightening device that happens to also curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a licensed cosmetologist since the 80&#x27;s. My most popular in demand service was hair straightening.  And I never used chemicals.  I was all about blow out.  I could straighten any type of hair with a blow dryer and roller brush.  However, you pay for it, because I do it right and it can take over an hour depending on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on novelty devices or tools that eliminate your creative methods.  But I will try anything once.  This is well made, but for the home, a single person use iron.  The appeal with this device is that it does is correctly, and well, if you do it correctly and well.  People that brush there hair and just iron it is damaging the hair and it never looks straight.  If it is not straight, flowing and shiny, then the person that did it, if not yourself, did it wrong.  There is no reason why your hair cannot be straight without chemicals.  Since the only correct way to straighten is with roller brush and heat, this is very impressive tool to do exactly that, continuously roiling the hair with heat.  The roller goes in both directions at your desired level, and control of heat.  The incorporated brush sounds simply enough, but is the answer to getting the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list price is okay, but my opinion is that is needs to be about 20% less.  But due to the quality and the fact you would pay this amount or more for a stylist to do it once, it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not getting the shiny flowing straight hair result, you are not holding the hair tight enough.  Start as close to the root as possible and don&#x27;t overload the chamber.  The length is there for wrapping.  Not straightening.  You should not be working more than 2&amp;#34; width of hair and keep the hair taught all the way to the end.  If you&#x27;re hair is sagging at all during this, you will burn your hair.  If you have very long hair, you have a lot of work to do, and the length of your arms will be tough.  Just don&#x27;t do a portion of a section.  If you cannot handle the length, you will need to get a friend to do it for you.  Someone that is not afraid of pulling your hair tight.  Your hair should not be wet when using the iron.  You should use a roller brush and blow dry your hair just a bit.  Then use the iron.  And finish by blowing with a roller brush again so the strands are loose and flowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a professional tool, to me, but close.  I&#x27;m not sure how long the ionic bristles will last, but for home use, it should last quite a while.  There are very important features that seem simple, but the fact the power cord is 6&#x27; long and swivels means you will not get tangled, and will be able to get to any angle easily.  The handle is comfortable and ergonomic which helps since this process takes a while.  But it takes half the time than just using a brush and dryer.  Use an alcohol free gel before ironing, and your work will last a few days.  Wear a hair net to bed, and not a hat or scarf as your hair needs to breath and sweat will ruin your work.  Extend it even more with dry spray shampoo.f work to do, and the length of your arms will be tough.  Just don&#x27;t do a portion of a section.

    <li> I have naturally curly hair, so for me the InStyler worked best at straightening my hair and also at giving it softer curls.  I did find that to keep it from getting tangled it worked best if I used it on slightly damp hair.  To straighten my entire head, it took 45+ minutes so it wasn&#x27;t quick for beyond shoulder length hair, but it definitely worked better than the other stylers I&#x27;ve tried.  It does get pretty hot, so watch where you are placing your fingers, as I got a couple good burns.  Overall a fun and slightly easier way for me to change up my hair routine.  Additionally my daughter tried it out on her straight shoulder length hair and she got great results both for smoothing and curling hers.</li>
    <li> I think that&#x27;s the bottom line.  I also only straighten (flat iron) my naturally curly hair once in a blue moon.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m coarse or fine - I have tons of (individually) fine \\&quot;flyaway\\&quot; hair but curly/wiry as well - the best and worst of southern AND northern Europe, genetically.  I mention because it can be tough to get my hair straight without frying it, and this is as straight as I&#x27;ve been able to get it at relatively low temperatures - by which I mean, shockingly straight.  My family, generally used to seeing my above-shoulder length hair only in boing!-boing! mode, was appalled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using the barrel guard provided as well as the cool tip, quite simply because I am klutzy.  Although klutzy, I have yet to figure out a way to get my hair caught on any part of this unit, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual mentions the online videos about ten times.  I would say watch these, as they are brief/to the point, and there is no substitute for being able to follow along with demonstrated motions.  A heat-resistant glove is always a useful thing, and you&#x27;ll want some clips to section off hair unless your \\&quot;do\\&quot; is very short or your hair relatively thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised that a rotating barrel can make the difference it does in terms of getting professional-looking effects.  I&#x27;m not sure of the point of having it rotate in two directions, but I suppose that gives you the freedom to flip or undercurl as desired whether holding the iron with the brush part facing out, or in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like the swivel cord, which is a boon to klutzy stylers and those working in cramped areas.</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal hairstyling gadget that can work as either a hair straightener or  curler.  The major feature is the two way rotating barrel.  This device works for all hair types and has four heat settings with the highest temp going to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.  With its ability to curl, straighten, wave, and add body and shine most women who care about how their hair looks will love this product that will save them money and time with fewer trips to the hairdresser.</li>
    <li> hate it returned burnt my hair</li>
    <li> I have shoulder-length hair that is quite thick, and tends to sag under its own weight often -- while getting frizzy in periods of high humidity. So a tool that can straighten out the frizzies, while building in some volume, seems like the perfect option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so it is, with a few caveats. While it heats up quickly (a big plus), it gets very hot, very quickly. I still find myself spending a lot of time tweaking the temperature so that I can tackle the hair without risking scorching my hands or myself -- not the look I&#x27;m after. For my taste, I also found it to be a bit heavy for my wrist, and that may be something to consider if you&#x27;ve got very long hair and will require a lot of time to work on it, or if you&#x27;re battling arthritis or any neurological deficits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line? I&#x27;ll never emerge with salon-like hair after using this, but it&#x27;s a very useful tool, given the combination of features. It&#x27;s effective on thick hair, unlike some stylers that can only tackle smaller pieces at a time. While the manufacturer suggests using this on dry hair, I&#x27;d argue in favor of slightly damp hair for the best results. Above all, if you&#x27;re going to invest the money in this gizmo, DO be prepared to invest the time to learn how to use it properly. You&#x27;ll get more out of it, and avoid burns and scorches. It&#x27;s far more finicky than other tools I&#x27;ve used, but the results are better. It&#x27;s common sense.</li>
    <li> thank you for the speedy delivery. I love it!</li>
    <li> Evolution of the straightening iron and curling iron is present in this rotating iron. It can be used as either a curler or a straightener. The curling iron is well built and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. It has long bristles to help keep the hair organized as it passes through the iron. The iron heats up to a max of around 425 degrees pretty quickly and has a few settings to get less heat if desired. It heats up to your setting in under a minute and is easy to use without tugging or pulling on hair. I also like the auto-shut off safety feature as irons are often left on at my house.</li>
    <li> What a great product! It works perfectly and make beautiful curls!</li>
    <li> It was okay just didn&#x27;t like the noise, I returned it.</li>
    <li> I have wet-2-dry Instyler, and I like it very much, except for the fact that it only rotates one way. I was very excited to try Max-2-Way since it can rotate both ways, even though it is for dried hair only. To make it rotate in the opposite direction, you need to click it closed twice. I do have trouble with this feature because it only works half of the time, so I need to click twice, then check to see if it rotates to where I want it, which is rather annoying, even though I mostly need to switch direction only couple of times per session. I would have preferred a sliding switch. That being said, it polishes and adds volume to my short to medium length hair. It leaves hair soft and glossy. The key is to make sure to only work on small amounts of hair, do not try to do half of your hair in one go. The included comb definitively helps. The instyler heats relatively quick. 30 seconds is only true for the lowest setting, though. I like that they include a fabric pad to protect the counter from heat.</li>
    <li> Pros: It comes will all the things you expect when you pay a lot for a gadget: a little pad to keep it from burning things, a cover for the plug, a special brush, etc. It heats up very quickly, and you can control how hot it gets. It straightened my hair quickly and well. The instructions are very detailed. Cons: It is so freaking HOT! HINT: When you turn it on, it starts at the highest temperature, so make sure you bring it down. According to the instructions, don&#x27;t worry about the steam. Sorry, seeing steam coming from the vicinity of my scalp still worries me! Other info: Made in China</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and straight, and I always wish I could add some loose waves so I’d have a little variety. In theory, this InStyler Rotating Iron seems like a good and easy way to do so, but I can’t figure it out. I’ve tried a lot of various products, including other InStylers, and I haven’t had luck with any of them. There’s no way I’d spend $100 on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This InStyler has a barrel that rotates both ways, but it’s really hard to tell which way it’s rotating, and which way it should be rotating. To switch directions, you close it twice quickly. But it also seems to do it when you hold the unit closed too tightly; I had it switch directions without me intending for that to happen. If I was trying to do my hair in the morning, chances are I’d get frustrated with figuring out which way the barrel should rotate for which side of my head I’m on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom couldn’t stop laughing at me as I tried to wrap my hair around the barrel to curl or wave it. Why? Because I couldn’t get my hair wrapped around the barrel! The brush gets in the way of seeing what you’re doing, and it’s just awkward to use. I can’t imagine trying to curl short hair with this; my hair is mid-back length and I couldn’t get it wrapped around the barrel with all that length to work with. The ends are also tricky to get in there, since you wrap the hair around the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have gotten better results if someone else was doing my hair, but how does that save me time? I’d also worry about that someone burning themselves. This InStyler comes with a cool tip and a thermal guard for the barrel, but it was still super hot. For experimentation, I did see how long it took to heat up at the maximum level; it took about 2 minutes compared to the 30 second rapid heat up the description claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron function works, but if I needed a flat iron, I’d get one, not a complicated combo product that didn’t work for me.</li>
    <li> This product is good, but doesn&#x27;t create as much as a flip as I would like.</li>
    <li> The product was defective I could just use for 1 month and after that it was not working</li>
    <li> I have used regular flat iron for years and bought this in hopes of having straight hair that didn&#x27;t look like I flat ironed it.  It does straighten while leaving volume thanks to roller. I haven&#x27;t mastered the curl and it is not the best tool for fringe as hard to get in tight places.  I am not the most patient person when getting ready for my day and you do need to pull through hair slowly for best results; not sure it takes longer overall but feels like...  I think rather pricey which is why I am rating 4/5.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, quick and didn&#x27;t burn my hair. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
    <li> Best straightener/curler out there. Had to buy another for my teenage daughter!</li>
    <li> I love my 2-way InStyler!  I started out with the original InStyler one-way rotating barrel and was continually frustrated.  It would have worked great had I wanted to have my hair flip up on one side and turn under on the other.  With the one-way rotating barrel, trying to maneuver the InStyler around without burning myself was almost impossible.  I returned it and purchased the 2-way rotating barrel - what a world of difference!  Now with 2 clicks of the handle, the barrel rotates in the other direction.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron 3/4&amp;#34; for short hair&lt;br /&gt;InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron 1-1/4&amp;#34; for shoulder length or longer hair</li>
    <li> This tool is awesome.  I have thick, coarse, colored hair.  With the first use, I saw softness I had not ever seen in my hair with using a flat iron.  I liked the 2-way rotation which really helps when styling the opposite side of my head and not having an issue of trying to capture hair easily.  This product does what it says and more.  I cannot recommend it enough to those who want straightened, soft hair.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet to curl, but am anxious to try that, too.  The trick is to move through the hair slowly to let the rotating barrel do its job.  I have searched a long time for a styling tool that is very portable, does what it says it will, does not damage hair, and gets my hair looking professionally styled.  This is a winner.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy again or give as a gift.  I am pleasantly surprised with how easy it is to use and the results on my hair couldn&#x27;t have been better.  Thanks for a great product... flat irons should go away and flocked curlers, too.  This is the only hair styling tool needed as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever...........</li>
    <li> I used the firs flat iron that came out in the 1970&#x27;s. Clairol was the rand that came out with it back then. I had to hold it closed for it to work. I got a different one in the 90&#x27;s and it liked to stay open. That one was harder to  use. I went to using a huge round brush with a blow dryer. I seen this advertised and had my doubts. My doubts were  gone the very first time I used it. It takes the frizz out of my hair and left my hair with the boy we all want.</li>
    <li> This one makes a good impression right away with a rapid fire heat element that makes it ready to go in less than 30 seconds and a nice ergonomic feel in the hands with responsive, intuitive controls. Straightening results are excellent with nice shine and unlike typical straightening irons there&#x27;s a nice bit of lift to the finish. Curling results also come out great and this is where the benefits of the rotating barrel really shines through. Give yourself a couple of sessions to hone your technique and once you have that down you&#x27;ll appreciate the styling boost that this product provides.</li>
    <li> The premise here is that this is a quick flat iron.  The ceramic barrel heats up and rotates when you turn on the iron (and this specific model is designed so that if you click it together twice it will reverse the direction of how the barrel turns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The videos give a much better description of how this works vs in writing, but since the barrel is rotating it helps flatten out the hair when you&#x27;re slowly pulling it through (i.e. it is doing the work for you instead of you having to go through your hair multiple times).  The side opposite of the barrel has a brush as well to pull your hair through it and help give it a bit of grip on your hair (and prevent the barrel from pulling it around).  Supposedly you are able to get the ends of your hair curled up as well at the bottom, but it might take a bit of practice to get that done.</li>
    <li> This is a decent curling iron/straightener at a bit of an inflated price.  I am as yet not skilled enough to really use this appliance effectively and am still relying on a good hair cut from a stylist, my hair dryer and some product.  Possibly this works best for people who have a lot of skill with curling irons and straighteners already.</li>
    <li> Many thanks to Amazon and the seller Instyler of the Instyler Max 2 way rotating iron for my wife&amp;#34;s hair, she loves it.</li>
    <li> The In styler is PERFECT, unfortunately it&#x27;s the thicker barrel so most of my hair is too short. I wish this model came in the thinner 3/4 inch barrel, the it would be 6 stars!  I love the dual rotating barrel, very easy to use on both sides of the head. Much safer to use than the 80s style curling iron!</li>
    <li> A gal sometimes needs a confidence booster, especially if her hair is as flat as french crepes, which mine definitely is. I have hair so stick-straight the only perm I ever got completely fell out after two days. I haven&#x27;t used a curling iron in, oh, maybe ten years or so. How did the Instyler stack up for the hair-styling ignoramus that is Codemaster Talon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty great. Some details point by point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The iron looks elegant and is very easy to use (It would have to be for me to understand it). You click the brush and cylinder together once for forward rotation, twice for backward. The rotating cylinder is tangle-proof, giving piece of mind to those with long, fine, or just plain out-of-control hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The InStyler heats up in a just few seconds, which is amazing to those of us used to the old-fashioned ones that took forever. There are a bunch a videos on instyler.com  for the visually-oriented, which is me. I appreciate the unit&#x27;s versatility; you can curl, straighten, flip out, flip in, boost  volume (my favorite), and just get poofy in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The product comes with a \\&quot;mat\\&quot; ( a small nylon square) for laying the unit on when hot, a wide-tooth comb, and a \\&quot;Thermal Guard Training Aid\\&quot;, which is essential training wheels so you don&#x27;t accidentally perform cosmetic surgery on yourself a la Harvey Dent. When you feel comfortable using the styler you wait until the unit is cool and pop the training aid off the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth $100? I think it is. I wouldn&#x27;t pay more, and if you see it for less you should snag it. I can finally throw away my old curling iron (and I do mean old), and I won&#x27;t need another one until 2025 or so. At which point may be we&#x27;ll have robots to curl our hair for us. Until then:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RATING: A-&lt;br /&gt;Specs: 120 Volts, 60 Hertz and 50 Watts</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t order this iron because I had a so-so experience with another type of brush/iron that tangled in my hair and didn&#x27;t work for my 3B natural curly hair. All I can say now is InStyler -- WOW. I have a sedo flat iron that I paid over $150 for and is a workhorse. But I have to heat the heck out of it and then squeeze it as hard as possible to get as straight as possible. It was hard to do a whole head of hair (lots of it) by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InStyler heats up great (it&#x27;s HOT and fast) and the combo of an iron and a brush to smooth and straighten the (dry) hair as you go down is perfect. No heavy pressure needed and it&#x27;s alot like slowly brushing through your hair. I still need to comb out or detangle before straightening, but once that&#x27;s done I do a section at a time. No fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try to keep the straight hair over a few days and see how maintenance will work out. It&#x27;s been so EASY! I just work on the sections that frizzed or curled--like underneath near my neck where I sweat--and in a few minutes my hair is refreshed and straight. I can&#x27;t say enough! The extra wide comb with picks to section your  hair and the mat included to place the iron on when using it are helpful too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE~!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. It leaves my hair frizzy and my ends don&#x27;t get a nice finish. I really was looking forward for this product but it was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> We tried this out and basically found that while it was a good-performing curling iron/straightener, the rotating barrel seemed to be a bit of a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible that we just failed to hone our technique, but are reasonably competent folk and found little advantage to that part of the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, gimmickry aside, this really is a great curling iron. It heats up lightning fast, is comfortable to use and comes with a good amount of documentation and accessories (like a guard to prevent burning fingers, and a burn-proof pad to put on your counter top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good overall.</li>
    <li> easy to handle, great</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any better results than using curling and flat iron. The hair didn&#x27;t look any smoother and there was no wow factor.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed good in theory but it takes more work and with figuring out which way barrel spins it&#x27;s not worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Love this, saves time in morning.  I wanted to try this as well as having a back up for when my chi stops working.</li>
    <li> I have terribly thick, kinky hair. I am in the middle of transitioning without &#x27;the big chop&amp;#34; so my hair tangles something wicked. I have about 8-10 inches of hair. My hair is borderline unmanageable, so I keep it braided and wear wigs. I can barely comb it. It&#x27;s really sad. Perms made it brittle and unattractively thin so that&#x27;s why I stopped getting them. But even as a kid, without a perm my hair almost feels like a fro or dreads. I can&#x27;t win! So now you can imagine my hair type to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after debating for a few months since heat flat irons don&#x27;t really straighten my hair. Flat irons just make it flatter, but still kinky and it would go back to puffy after an hour and I still couldn&#x27;t comb it. HOWEVER, THIS PRODUCT is amazing. I used to lowest setting and tested a quarter patch of hair (in sections of course) and was amazed. My hair was softer, I could comb it, it moved and I had some body still. This thing seems like a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No don&#x27;t get excited and think my hair was perm straight. That&#x27;s not going to happen and I&#x27;m fine with that, I just needed control during this transitioning time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw is that even on the lowest heat setting, it&#x27;s VERY VERY hot. Use the cool tip thing on the end and save yourself some grief.&lt;br /&gt;I worry the bristles may wear out in time, but we shall see. So far so good! 4 stars only because of the high, high heat.</li>
    <li> Great for between salon styling. I have naturally curly hair that gets even curlier in wet or humid weather... and since I have to make public appearances for book signings... I need a hair appliance that is easy to use for tough-ups and on the go ease.</li>
    <li> I prefer the original -- likely just need to get used to the alternating direction.</li>
