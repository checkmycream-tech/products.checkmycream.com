      <li>Easy to use, not greasy, no bad smell!</li>
      <li>I have always liked Vitamin C Serum for my face because it seems to tighten, renew, and gives it a fresh, clean, and youthful look.</li>
      <li>Light and easy to apply to the face.</li>
      <li>I started noticing within a week that some fine lines have been reduced.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>And so far, so good.</li>
      <li>It absorbs right away, but I can&#x27;t tell that my face is smoother, softer, clearer or more moisturized.</li>
      <li>The owner or manufacturer emailed me and left me a very nice voice message.</li>
      <li>Ok, so I have been using the Main Line Vitamin C Serum for exactly a month, and so now I feel I&#x27;m in a pretty good position to write a review.</li>
      <li>Pros- nongreasy, instant tightening, fades sun freckles, expedited healing time of facial blemishes, great list of mostly organic ingredients with no weird additives,  nice functioning pump.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to have beautiful skin.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see the full results after using it for while.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received at a discounted rate for review purposes, but am going to buy one for my mom at full price.</li>
      <li>(My favorite for the record is CRX Vitamin C Potent Topical Serum</li>
      <li>I found that the skin absorbs this product rather quickly.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been long overdue in getting some more, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>

      <li>And that&#x27;s worth a lot</li>
      <li>So far I love how my skin feels</li>
      <li>IT WAS RAPIDLY ABSORBED</li>
      <li>I liked that this absorbed quickly, allowing me to apply moisturizer without having to wait too long in between.  </li>

      <li>texture of the Main Line Vitamin C serum is silky smooth and has a &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; feel to it, providing lots of coverage.</li>
      <li>I received the item discounted for my review and I am so excited to see if the product will live up to the hype!</li>

      <li>First product I have seen that has both Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid together.  </li>

      <li>It only takes one pump for me to cover my face and neck and the serum absorbs very quickly.</li>
      <li>Very surprising as I was skeptical that the vitamin c would work.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It smells fresh and leaves the skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
      <li>in all I&#x27;ll try to overcome the smell and continue using this serum because I really like the results I&#x27;m seeing and appreciate the quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>Since there has been so much press about this, when I saw the discount coupon, I ordered this immediately.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks. I was excited to try it out as the reviews are overwhelmingly positive. I specifically purchased it for that reason--the positive reviews. I&#x27;m not sure what to make of it--the smell is strange, almost like a smoky smell. It takes a few pumps (not drops) to cover my face and I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different. It absorbs right away, but I can&#x27;t tell that my face is smoother, softer, clearer or more moisturized.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product. The smell makes me not want to use it</li>
    <li> Love this Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> Light and easy to apply to the face. It&#x27;s smaller size than i thought but overall like the product</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I have dry sensitive skin and I live in a very dry climate, so I have to be careful what I use on my skin and I am in constant need of hydration. I have been using this for over 4 months, my mother, grandmother and best friend all use this religiously! My skin appears more hydrated, brighter and I have seen a reduction in the acne I occasionally get. It only takes one pump for me to cover my face and neck and the serum absorbs very quickly. I don&#x27;t notice any smell as some of the other folks on here have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of it a for 2 weeks or so while I was traveling and I noticed a decline in the brightness of my skin and a recurrence of the acne I sometimes get. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy to use serum that has great results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 days now and I notice my skin is much more smooth and brighter. My pores are even smaller. I feel more confident not wearing foundation or powder. Just eyeliner and lip gloss.</li>
    <li> I WAS GIVEN THIS SERUM TO TEST AND REVIEW. I HAVE JUST STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT SO I WILL UPDATE MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS AT A LATER TIME.  I TRIED THE SERUM IN PLACE OF A MOISTURIZER AND I AM PLEASED WITH THE THE WAY IT WAS RAPIDLY ABSORBED AND DIDN&#x27;T LEAVE A STICKY OR GREASY RESIDUE.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel awesome!</li>
    <li> I used the serum for the first time last night and I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth my face felt, it was amazing!! I can assuredly say that I&#x27;m going to love this stuff!!!! Thank you thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
    <li> Seems to be great.  It will take awhile to be sure of the results.  At first it seemed a little sticky when I applied it, but after a minute that went away.  I think I will love this product.</li>
    <li> Makes the face nice and firm</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid serums before, and I have to say that this has the strongest tightening effect I&#x27;ve encountered.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, so I don&#x27;t know the long-term effects yet, but I promise that I will post an update if it doesn&#x27;t deliver as promised.  I have had great success with vitamin C in the past to help with lightening hyperpigmentation in the past, so I expect this will work well...I&#x27;ve been long overdue in getting some more, that&#x27;s for sure.  I liked that this absorbed quickly, allowing me to apply moisturizer without having to wait too long in between.  My only concern is that the bottle isn&#x27;t dark or opaque...my understanding was that vitamin C is sometimes less stable if exposed to light, but I&#x27;m not an expert (this is the reason for the loss of one star, though).  I will post an update if the results are not as expected!  Just fyi, I did receive a discount on this product in return for my genuine opinion, which this is. :)</li>
    <li> I received the item discounted for my review and I am so excited to see if the product will live up to the hype! It smells great 😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum in place of my moisturizer ... it feels and looks great!</li>
    <li> Bonus! You don&#x27;t have to mix the two products to get the result because in this Serum they are already mixed. Vitamin C serum is a fantastic daily skin treatment for anti-aging and fine lines. I use this twice a day. If you are looking for something that smells good this is not it. As with any Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid treatments they are not made for the smell they are made for the result. If you find one that smells good it is likely not going to produce the results you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I just got this today, so I&#x27;ll be coming back to add to this review later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a vitamin C serum for a while now, as I&#x27;m very concerned about my skin, especially the lines and dark circles under my eyes from being chronically ill. Luckily, I was able to buy this one at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review. I&#x27;m really excited to see the results of daily use over the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I do notice that strange smell that other reviewers have mentioned (it reminds me of these bacon flavored treats that my dogs love), but it goes away very quickly once the serum sinks into your skin so it&#x27;s not a big issue for me. I would definitely prefer a different scent; usually vitamin C makes me think of citrus, and since the serum is orange in color I would&#x27;ve expected an orangey scent. But it&#x27;s not a dealbreaker as long as the serum does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs into the skin very quickly, although since it&#x27;s fairly thin it does take a couple pumps to cover my whole face and neck. I like the fact that it has hyaluronic acid, which helps to make your moisturizer do more for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll come back in a couple weeks with updates and maybe photos. Right now, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Main Line&#x27;s Vitamin C serum for 2 weeks now with really good results!  It also contains Hyaluronic Acid which I need for hydration.  I apply the serum AM or PM.  It absorbs nicely without that sticky feeling.  I love the way my face and neck feel immediately after application....just a few drops and I see brighter smoother look and firmer feel.  Then I top off with my day or night cream and I&#x27;m good to go.  So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> This product was just what I was looking for. I have always liked Vitamin C Serum for my face because it seems to tighten, renew, and gives it a fresh, clean, and youthful look. This product did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied the product does not feel sticky nor does it feel heavy. Instead, it applies smoothy and dries to a natural feel. It also smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received at a discounted rate for review purposes, but am going to buy one for my mom at full price. Also, I plan to buy more when mine runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> I purchased this product through a discounted price website ** It did not change the quality of the product. It felt good on my skin and made me feel refreshed. I just recently started using it but I can tell its going to last me a long time!</li>
    <li> I am 30 with just faint wrinkles developing around my eyes. I also have some newer acne scars. I have had this product for about a week. I found that the skin absorbs this product rather quickly. It is very liquidy with hardly no scent (I saw a couple reviews indicating it had a foul smell; I did not find this to be the case). So far, with daily use, I have noticed some small differences. I do feel like my skin is a little &amp;#34;brighter.&amp;#34; I even got asked if I was using something new. And it also feels slightly tighter. I can say those newer acne scars seemed to fade away a little faster. Not to say that I don&#x27;t have even newer ones, though. I do not want to link them to this product, though, because I don&#x27;t think that is the case. I am excited to see if these results will continue to improve my skin! Please note that received this product at a discount in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, my skin looks great. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for the last two weeks and my skin has become radiant.  I have extremely sensitive skin that breaks out but I have had no problems with any kind of break outs.  I showed it to my friend who is an aesthetician and she was very impressed with the quality of the serum. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to have beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> As a middle aged man, I thought, what the heck… Let&#x27;s give this stuff a try! And so far, so good. I can&#x27;t speak to the benefits of anti-aging so far, but my face skin feels good! And that&#x27;s worth a lot, right??</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and my skin started looking better from the first use. The serum absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. My skin definitely looks smoother and has a healthy glow. I can&#x27;t wait to see the full results after using it for while. The pump dispenser is nice and I like that I only have to use it once a day.</li>
    <li> Great Product!! High end ingredients for a great price.  Skin stays hydrated all day because of the Hyaluronic Acid.  Great under makeup.  Actually prepares your skin for better looking makeup application. First product I have seen that has both Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid together.  Great combo for great looking skin!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, not greasy, no bad smell! Seems to tighten everything back up and makes me feel better about living in florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Increase collaged production in the skin (this helps get rid of wrinkles)&lt;br /&gt;Brighten and tighten the skin&lt;br /&gt;Reduce the effects of negative sun exposure (Not all sun exposure is bad)&lt;br /&gt;Reduce chlorine exposure&lt;br /&gt;Helps skin repair itself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Start small and do not add extra Vitamin C as it is acidic and can/will burn the skin if the concentration is too high.&lt;br /&gt;If you have extra sensitive skin, start small or dilute with water&lt;br /&gt;If you are dealing with a lot of wrinkles or very dry skin, extra vitamin C can be added, but work up slowly and test on the inner arm before applying to the face</li>
    <li> 9/5/2014 I just received this today so this is my initial review and I will update it later. I&#x27;m using it to help with hyperpigmentation and acne scars. PACKAGE: Very nice glass bottle with pump. Cute label. COLOR: Liquid is cloudy yellow. TEXTURE: Very light, liquidy. Absorbs quickly and is not sticky. FRAGRANCE: Smells bad like stagnant water, I can&#x27;t really describe it any other way. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger though. Overall I&#x27;m not really impressed with this product but hopefully that will change with continued use. 2/5 stars    9/19/2014 update after using for two weeks  The owner or manufacturer emailed me and left me a very nice voice message. It&#x27;s refreshing to see someone take pride in their product. I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but the serum may have potential with continued use. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet but I did feel a slight tightening/plumping effect! :) I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement in hyperpigmentation or acne scars but that wasn&#x27;t advertised so I can&#x27;t hold it against the product. I have very dry and sensitive skin so I have to put on facial lotion afterwards. I&#x27;ll update if anything else changes. 3/5 stars    10/17/2014 update #2 I may have a new beauty staple... not certain yet.  I&#x27;m seeing a difference in the clarity of my skin but I can&#x27;t be certain that it&#x27;s solely due to the serum because I have hormonal issues and am taking supplements for vitamin deficiencies. With that being said: the acne bumps I do get are going away quicker than they used to, my skin is getting smoother, and my sensitive skin seems to heal quicker. Hyperpigmentation is still the same but I&#x27;m more comfortable with it because my skin isn&#x27;t as bumpy. The serum seems to have worked slower for me but that&#x27;s fine :D patience is a virtue. I&#x27;ll do one more update when I finish the bottle. 3.5/5 stars    11/28/2014 Final update #3 Decent product  I&#x27;m basically done with the bottle. I literally have to unscrew the top for the next couple of days to use it because once it gets down to a certain point it will no longer pump. Overall, this is a decent product and over the last couple of months I&#x27;ve seen a minimal improvement in my skin. Like I said before, it took a while for me to see any difference but since I&#x27;ve been dealing with skin issues for the last 7 years I&#x27;ll take any improvement. The price has increased for this bottle but I do plan on purchasing another bottle of vitamin C serum. SN: I may try another brand since this is my first time using a Vit. C serum; I would like to compare another brand with this one. 3.5/5 stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for the past 3 days and I am already seeing some results. Pros- nongreasy, instant tightening, fades sun freckles, expedited healing time of facial blemishes, great list of mostly organic ingredients with no weird additives,  nice functioning pump. Cons- a very off-putting hotdog smell. I really wish there was a more pleasant scent for something I put on my face. Even my husband asked me &amp;#34;what smells like old carnival hotdogs?&amp;#34; Well if my face don&#x27;t smell good at least I look good.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;ll try to overcome the smell and continue using this serum because I really like the results I&#x27;m seeing and appreciate the quality ingredients. I received this at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This product did not work on my face and it had a weird smell.</li>
    <li> Great for my face!  Trying to eliminate the lines around my eyes that are coming in.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while and it seems to be working pretty well! not too greasy!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have been using the Main Line Vitamin C Serum for exactly a month, and so now I feel I&#x27;m in a pretty good position to write a review. Please note that I received the opportunity to review this one at a discounted price for my unbiased review. I have tried several Vitamin C serums over the past two years, and I can easily say this is my second favorite that I&#x27;ve tried to date. (My favorite for the record is CRX Vitamin C Potent Topical Serum 27%.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the Main Line Vitamin C serum is silky smooth and has a &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; feel to it, providing lots of coverage. It feels good going on and stays on. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oil after applying. I do find that you will need to apply some type of moisturizer after applying this serum - in other words, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it as your moisturizer exclusively. I found the smell to be &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; with a hint of orange peel, so that smokiness might appeal to some and might be a turnoff to others. I found it to be pleasant. My face has been blemish-free for the past month, and the fine lines around my eyes have decreased. My skin &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; healthier. I would say thumbs up on this product and will likely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice product. If you like vit c products on your face you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Ive used it for a month and see some changes in the lines on my face.  Great product.  Thank you, Joan Porter</li>

    <li> This feels nice and light on my skin, not greasy or heavy. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
    <li> I started noticing within a week that some fine lines have been reduced. Very surprising as I was skeptical that the vitamin c would work. Since there has been so much press about this, when I saw the discount coupon, I ordered this immediately. Now I understand why women are talking about Vitamin C Serum. I would recommend this to buyers considering Vit C Serum.</li>
    <li> great product, i love how light it is and no scent at all. you don&#x27;t even feel it&#x27;s there after just seconds of application.</li>
    <li> It smells fresh and leaves the skin feeling soft and refreshed. I would recommend it to someone looking for an inexpensive way to improve their overall skin.</li>
    <li> after using it , it makes my skin brighter and reduces my wrinkle</li>
