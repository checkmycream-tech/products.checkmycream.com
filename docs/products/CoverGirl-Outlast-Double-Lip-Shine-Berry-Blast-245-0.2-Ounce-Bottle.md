<li> The gloss is a little stickier than I like (my stray hairs stick to it, for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Hated to pay the exorbitant price but that is what you have to do when a favorite item is discontinued.  </li>
<li> Have purchased 13 of them always afraid they will run out of my color.  </li>

    <li> Love this color. Sometimes I refresh it after several hours.</li>
    <li> I love this long lasting lipstick. It stays on, sometimes all day! This is my favorite color for my skin tone.  I have not been able to find a comparable product or color! Darn!</li>
    <li> This was a great value for this product.  I do like the CoverGirl long-lasting lipstick products and this just happened to be a shade that was just right at a bargain price.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip color ever!</li>
    <li> what I ordered!  would order again.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Stays on for the whole day. Love, love, love the color. It goes with the purple I put in my hair!</li>
    <li> Great colored that I had already bought in the store. Long-lasting, non-drying, won&#x27;t transfer and stays on till you take it off. Wish I could find more colors that I like.</li>
    <li> Seems as if the lipstick is less &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as when I buy it at the store but since I can&#x27;t find it at the store anymore, this will have to do.</li>
    <li> Love this color. Could not find it in Stores</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick.  I can put it on in the morning and it lasts all day, even through meals.  I have been using this lipstick for several years but was unable to find this particular color at the local drug store so that is why I ordered it on line. It is my favorite color so was glad I found it .  I use this lipstick also in other colors as well.  I hope that they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> The color was much darker when it arrived then what I saw online. If you want a stay on lip gloss this one does work, lasted a long time, and it was not drying while on. However the color was not what I was hoping for. If you already know exactly what you like this is a good deal, but I would not buy this without trying it first to get the correct color.</li>
    <li> Love this, and love the color. I wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued</li>
    <li> I guess this is a gloss, but I&#x27;ve never had one that lasted all day before. It&#x27;s a beautiful color and goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> The first problem with this stuff is that it&#x27;s a bitch to open. Completely coated in plastic with no perforation for easy tearing, it took forever for me to even get it open. Once on, it&#x27;s nice. The gloss is a little stickier than I like (my stray hairs stick to it, for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives are that it *does* have staying power. Mine was on even after a meal. Also, it seems like there is a better color selection than for the L&#x27;oreal Infallible gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I still like the L&#x27;oreal Infallible better and will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lipstick been using it for over a year. Stays put moisturizing not like many of the others that are long lasting love the color. get lots of compliments on it.  Have purchased 13 of them always afraid they will run out of my color.  Try it you will Love Love Love it lots of shine.</li>
    <li> Hated to pay the exorbitant price but that is what you have to do when a favorite item is discontinued.  I love this color and how long it lasts.  Cover girl please bring it back!!!!</li>
