      <li>The title says it all, it&#x27;s a great product with no terrible smell to it...</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>works great with Loreal Quick Powder Bleach</li>
      <li>To make hair soft rub oil in hair to have perfect hair color and softness</li>
      <li>but I prefer the 40 since I like for my hair color to be super bright</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky about the color of my hair, so was happy with the results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
      <li>The color came out better and lasted longer.</li>
      <li>This product really leaves your hair in great shape after coloring</li>
      <li>Love the creme developer.</li>
      <li>I knew that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it</li>
      <li>Love the product, use it with my hair color.</li>
      <li>Works better than 20 volume.  </li>
      <li>ITS PRETTY GOOD TOO.</li>
      <li>I love getting the products I need so quickly and in such good shape.  </li>
      <li>works great with quick blue</li>
      <li>30 was plenty strong, if you use 40 it can be way more damaging, especially if used more than once.</li>
      <li>Works great doesn&#x27;t burn, highly recommend it specially with using other L&#x27;oreal products :)</li>
      <li>I slightly prefer Salon Care developer over this one, but overall it&#x27;s good quality and a good value.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
      <li>Worked amazing with the L&#x27;Oreal HiColor HiLights in Red.</li>
      <li>OTHER WISE</li>
      <li>Lightens my hair right away.</li>
      <li>She tried many times and had the same results every time.maybe</li>
      <li>exactly the color I wanted,</li>
      <li>I read a ton of reviews and even watched videos of people with black hair using these products together and getting fantastic results, so I thought for sure a 30 volume developer would work for me....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a professional, but I have been coloring my hair for many years.  </li>
      <li>I used this with l&#x27;oreal quick blue bleach, and got my dark-medium brown hair a pale yellow that was perfect for toning.</li>
      <li>Its actually a really large bottle</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d need that much developer but</li>
      <li>Works really well with L&#x27;Oreal Hicolor Highlights.</li>
      <li>I followed the mixing directions precisely and even left the de on for an additional 15 minutes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I get when I normally dye my hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this developer to use with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Quick Blue bleach to go golden blonde and just to strip old color out.</li>
      <li>Used the developer by itself on my dark brown hair and made my hair light brown.</li>
      <li>Good amount for 2 or 3 uses for my long and thick hair!</li>
      <li>Bought this to use with my L&#x27;Oreal Professional Preference Mega Red colors.</li>
      <li>If your hair is dark like mine and you want to go red, purple, or even blond or really lighten your hair use the 40.</li>

<li> They want ten words so here we go, seriously now?</li>

<li> It&#x27;s not healthy, get the 20 volume.</li>
<li> I usually use 30</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s what I usually use.</li>
<li> it was just a bad bottle</li>
<li> I had no idea it would fail to lift my hair this miserably.</li>

    <li> Awesome. .fast shipping</li>
    <li> Used the developer by itself on my dark brown hair and made my hair light brown. Use purple shampoo to town down brassines. To make hair soft rub oil in hair to have perfect hair color and softness</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before. It&#x27;s not my favorite but it&#x27;s what I usually use. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Probably cheaper to buy in store at Sally&#x27;s though.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! works great with quick blue</li>
    <li> Works well if your hair isn&#x27;t resistant. If your hair is dark like mine and you want to go red, purple, or even blond or really lighten your hair use the 40. I use the 30 if I&#x27;m going maybe one shade lighter.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use with my L&#x27;Oreal Professional Preference Mega Red colors. Works fine but is very thin and you get color all over yourself and possibly the floor. Be prepared for dripping</li>
    <li> Love the product, use it with my hair color.</li>
    <li> Works as well as other similar products. A bottle of the 20 vol strength is on the way as I write this review.</li>
    <li> I like it, it is beautiful.</li>
    <li> Good amount for 2 or 3 uses for my long and thick hair! Works great doesn&#x27;t burn, highly recommend it specially with using other L&#x27;oreal products :)</li>
    <li> It worked great. Didn&#x27;t seem to fry my hair or anything. It did sting my scalp a little bit, although it may have been the hair dye I was using with this that was making it burn, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> works great with Loreal Quick Powder Bleach</li>
    <li> Really great product. Creme developer is always best because it does not drip.</li>
    <li> I love getting the products I need so quickly and in such good shape.  This product really leaves your hair in great shape after coloring</li>
    <li> I used this with the L’Oreal Excellence Hicolor Hilights Red and it simply did nothing for my hair. It is a brown and not the usual red and magenta I get when I normally dye my hair. I&#x27;m disappointed because it sure smells like the chemicals were working but here was no lift. I usually use 30 but I guess I will try a 40 next time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this developer to use with Loreal Hicolor Red and it did virtually nothing to my hair; except my roots, which are now Ronald Mcdonald Red. I followed the mixing directions precisely and even left the de on for an additional 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was previously dyed a dark reddish brown. I read a ton of reviews and even watched videos of people with black hair using these products together and getting fantastic results, so I thought for sure a 30 volume developer would work for me....but no. Now my roots look ridiculous in comparison to the rest of my STILL DARK HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that I recommend this volume developer without doing a strand test 1st. I had no idea it would fail to lift my hair this miserably. I knew that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it exactly the color I wanted, but these results are terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I am quite bummed and pissed off about my hair situation.</li>
    <li> This works wonders. and its enough quantity to use with another dye. I Don&#x27;t know what else to say about it but it is great!</li>
    <li> i used it with loreal hi color red and worked just a bit&lt;br /&gt;it didnt damage my hair and feels the same</li>
    <li> Worked amazing with the L&#x27;Oreal HiColor HiLights in Red. Love the creme developer.</li>
    <li> I got it in two days, used it twice with no problems. Its actually a really large bottle and I got it in a bundled deal so it was only like $2 something</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived on time. Good price too. Works really well with L&#x27;Oreal Hicolor Highlights.</li>
    <li> Works well! Lightens my hair right away. Doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp either! I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORK GREAT...BUT I NEEDED 40 VOL TO ACHIEVE MY LOOK BUT OTHER WISE ITS PRETTY GOOD TOO. DEPENDS WAT HAIR COLOR YOUR TRYN TO PULL OFF</li>
    <li> I used this with l&#x27;oreal quick blue bleach, and got my dark-medium brown hair a pale yellow that was perfect for toning. AND I ONLY HAD TO BLEACH ONCE! 30 was plenty strong, if you use 40 it can be way more damaging, especially if used more than once.</li>
    <li> I bought this developer to use with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Quick Blue bleach to go golden blonde and just to strip old color out. I have used this on black, brown, and red hair dye and it worked well each time. It stripped all of my previous dye colors out every time I have used it, even dark blue-black dye. I slightly prefer Salon Care developer over this one, but overall it&#x27;s good quality and a good value.&lt;br /&gt;*I have edited this review a little because I have used this product again since the last time I reviewed it.</li>
    <li> This one was good but I prefer the 40 since I like for my hair color to be super bright</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for my daughter.She tried many times and had the same results every time.maybe it was just a bad bottle</li>
    <li> The title says it all, it&#x27;s a great product with no terrible smell to it...always a plus I think. Will happily buy again</li>
    <li> Works better than 20 volume.  I&#x27;m not a professional, but I have been coloring my hair for many years.  The color came out better and lasted longer. I&#x27;m very picky about the color of my hair, so was happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected.  No excitement, just practical. They want ten words so here we go, seriously now?</li>
    <li> I purchased this creme developer because the hair dye I was using advised to use this brand. I don&#x27;t have any complaints. It worked</li>
    <li> Used this product to dye my hair from a dark brown to a red. Seems to work well and I have left over as well.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot. I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d need that much developer but whatever I guess. I don&#x27;t recommend this on relaxed hair. It&#x27;s not healthy, get the 20 volume.</li>
