### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have tried about every type, and this one is the best.</li>
      <li>Too face have excellent products but this one belongs in the trash.</li>
      <li>Loved this!</li>
      <li>The Perfect Mascara by shiseido - which I give 5 stars, Too Face lash injection was almost as good.</li>
      <li>I am 45 and still looking for the great mascara.</li>
      <li>It makes your lashes look great.</li>
      <li>It stays put and looks great all day.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for a great mascara</li>
      <li>It would be great if not for the flaking.</li>
      <li>:o)</li>
      <li>Honestly, my eyes still look good after a night of sleeping on them!  </li>
      <li>My $3.99 Maybelline Great Lash is much better, and it didn&#x27;t get flakes in my eyes by mid-afternoon like this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Faced Lash Injection as a sample mini tube and loved it.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for, but good nonetheless.  </li>
      <li>I still love it!)</li>
      <li>I am hoping for better results!  </li>

      <li>The thing I liked most about it was that it doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear, which is espically nice when I&#x27;m working out.</li>
      <li>But more importantly, Too Faced does not run!!</li>
      <li>I originally went to buy the Diorshow mascara after reading great reviews, but the sales lady at Sephora convinced me that the Lash Injection was much better.  </li>
      <li>I bought this after a recommendation in Sephora and I love that this is nice mix of a waterproof type and non-waterproof type.  </li>
      <li>Good, couple coats gives nice, full lashes.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion , if we are gonna spend this kind of money on a mascara , it had better do all and more.</li>
      <li>If you want full lashes, that is about all this product is good for.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fade, which is very important to me.  </li>
      <li>I definitely love this mascara.</li>
      <li>Okay, so I have tried dozens upon dozens of mascara&#x27;s in my lifetime.</li>
      <li>I am 45, so I have tried SOOOO many mascaras in my lifetime.</li>

      <li>I love how it extends your lashes to make them look glamourous and how it makes your eyes stick out.</li>
      <li>In comparison to my favorite mascara  </li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara - and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of them.  </li>
      <li>Mabline has better mascara then this</li>
      <li>This is a good mascara at first</li>
      <li>I can not even begin to tell you how excited I am about this mascara!    </li>
      <li>Do a light coat from bottom of your lashes to the top.  </li>
      <li>After a full day of wear it&#x27;s still there!    </li>
      <li>mascara goes on easy- &lt;</li>
      <li>after a sweaty workout  Easy to use and apply.  </li>
      <li>Hands down the best mascara ever!  </li>
      <li>WIld (actually pretty darn good) and have finally found the best one on the planet! &lt;</li>
      <li>The longest thickest looking lashes I&#x27;ve ever experienced short of falsies.</li>
      <li>The mascara goes on smoothly and is virtually clump-free.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s different, but it works amazingly!  </li>
      <li>This is definitely one of the best mascara products I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It looks really clean-</li>
      <li>Overall, its an okay product but just not as amazing as some people make it out to be.</li>
      <li>and this is certainly one of my top picks.    </li>
      <li>All-around fantastic mascara!</li>
      <li>Just full.</li>
      <li>just big, thick gorgeous lashes that appear like magic!!!!</li>
      <li>Starting with the good news first.</li>
      <li>It is fine for my very sensitive eyes!!</li>
      <li>My tube now is ~ more than a year old...</li>
      <li>Well worth it</li>
      <li>Removing it is pretty easy, sometimes I even start by peeling it off (it coats your lashes with little tubes) and I find this very satisfying.  </li>
      <li>that right now has passed the test and its from Loreal.</li>
      <li>Despite not being advertised as a waterproof mascara, this is by far the best long lasting mascara out there.  </li>
      <li>They said the more coats you put on, the bigger and longer your lashes will look.  </li>
      <li>I first received Too</li>
      <li>Okay so I gave this mascara 1 star because I&#x27;ve been using this Mascara for several months now</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hot.</li>
      <li>When I first started wearing Too</li>
      <li>Lengthens and thickens lashes very well.  </li>
      <li>I REALLY like that the mascara is not too brittle.  </li>
      <li>Really does stay put quite well.  </li>
      <li>but it had way too much product on the brush</li>
      <li>as I find that I must run a eyebrow comb after using it - it&#x27;s just too much mascara otherwise.  </li>
      <li>well it added volume but because it was so much fuss like i rubbed my eyes after i put it on</li>
      <li>i really really tried to like this item and tied diffrent ways to apply it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for the brush that much -</li>
      <li>You just have to learn how much to apply.</li>
      <li>If not, back to the $3.99 tried and true product.</li>
      <li>the cost is way to much for such a bad product it clumps, and looks like bug legs my best mascara so far is my free one that i have.</li>
      <li>but you can cry and swim with more or less no issue.    </li>
      <li>br /&gt;It seperates your lashes into sexy little strands.</li>
      <li>But YES, my lashes look long and full.</li>
      <li>Some of the other high end mascara&#x27;s are too brittle and I have broken many of my own lashes with them.  </li>
      <li>I was very disappointed because the description sounds amazing and it looked good when I first put it on.</li>
      <li>live in Hawaii.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s new,</li>
      <li>I laugh a lot and so after a few hours I checked and no it didn&#x27;t pass my laugh test.</li>
      <li>I know this might come across as strange , using a laugh test, but hey I have 1 mascara</li>
      <li>After I apply to the bottom lashes of the first eye and then the next and repeat the process.  </li>
      <li>and then I go back and do the first one again.  </li>
      <li>and this mascara definitely make my lashes stand out better than any other.  </li>
      <li>It glides on thickly, but you can go back over quickly with the brush, and it&#x27;s easy to spread any lashes that stick together.  </li>
      <li>But the makeup saleslady said that heat makes the tubes expand, so now I either wash my face with warm water or take a hot shower and slough off the mascara with my finger, which is actually easier than going through my usual vasaline and toilet paper makeup removal routine!</li>
      <li>the first couple applications were hard cause the brush is fat and can cause lashes to clump a bit, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>I was out comparison shopping for mascara and was pleasantly surprised by Too Faced.</li>
      <li>So, I put it in a drawer and continued to use my old mascara, until I couldn&#x27;t get another drop.  </li>
      <li>You can apply one quick coat for a more subtle look or multiple coats for more dramatic results.</li>
      <li>It started flaking and getting clumpy when I put on the first coat, even though the brush was fairly dry.  </li>
      <li>My usual method of applying this mascara is to apply one coat to the top lashes of one eye and move to the next.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different mascaras, cheap, and less cheap, but this is the only one I have ever used that crumbled off and landed in my eyes while I was wearing it under totally average circumstances.</li>
      <li>(maybe easier to find since I don&#x27;t live near a Sephora or a Japanese drugstore).</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that because it stays on so well, it&#x27;s kind of hard to take off with traditional makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just different from other mascaras that way.</li>

    <li> I bought this after a recommendation in Sephora and I love that this is nice mix of a waterproof type and non-waterproof type.  It&#x27;s not to hard to come off - but you can cry and swim with more or less no issue.    I REALLY like that the mascara is not too brittle.  Some of the other high end mascara&#x27;s are too brittle and I have broken many of my own lashes with them.  So annoying.      My tube now is ~ more than a year old... and it&#x27;s finally starting to dry up and get flaky black bits by the end of the day on my eyes.      I don&#x27;t care for the brush that much - as I find that I must run a eyebrow comb after using it - it&#x27;s just too much mascara otherwise.  My lashes do look longer and thicker - I just wish it had a finer, self cleaning brush.    I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different mascaras, cheap, and less cheap, but this is the only one I have ever used that crumbled off and landed in my eyes while I was wearing it under totally average circumstances. I wasn&#x27;t doing anything that would make it crumble - rubbing my eyes, sweating, crying, etc. It just fell. I was very disappointed because the description sounds amazing and it looked good when I first put it on. I wear contacts, and that made it extra bad.</li>
    <li> I originally went to buy the Diorshow mascara after reading great reviews, but the sales lady at Sephora convinced me that the Lash Injection was much better.  Wow, what a bad decision.  It started flaking and getting clumpy when I put on the first coat, even though the brush was fairly dry.  I was told one coat would give me that voluminous \\&quot;false eyelash\\&quot; look, but it was so untrue.  My $3.99 Maybelline Great Lash is much better, and it didn&#x27;t get flakes in my eyes by mid-afternoon like this stuff!  I&#x27;ll be returning this to Sephora and exchanging it to try the Diorshow.  I am hoping for better results!  If not, back to the $3.99 tried and true product.</li>
    <li> I was out comparison shopping for mascara and was pleasantly surprised by Too Faced. I&#x27;ve never tried this product before. In comparison to my favorite mascara  The Perfect Mascara by shiseido - which I give 5 stars, Too Face lash injection was almost as good. Although  my lashes were dark and considerably longer, they seemed brittle and flakey. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this product, but the price is lower than other high end mascaras.</li>
    <li> Okay so I gave this mascara 1 star because I&#x27;ve been using this Mascara for several months now and I hate it. The only reason why I&#x27;m using it is because it&#x27;s $21. If you want full lashes, that is about all this product is good for. It doesn&#x27;t extend your lashes, it doesn&#x27;t make them look fake and so on. Just full. Yes it doesn&#x27;t smear or smug. However, it flaks like a bad gel. I spend all day wiping dried mascara flaks off my face. It also falls in my eye which is a pain in the bottom. So for $21 I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money. Too face have excellent products but this one belongs in the trash. Mabline has better mascara then this and it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
    <li> this mascara stinks! i am so disappointed well it added volume but because it was so much fuss like i rubbed my eyes after i put it on i really really tried to like this item and tied diffrent ways to apply it the cost is way to much for such a bad product it clumps, and looks like bug legs my best mascara so far is my free one that i have. in shorter terms don&#x27;t waste your money:I</li>
    <li> Despite not being advertised as a waterproof mascara, this is by far the best long lasting mascara out there.  It forms some sort of polymer tubes around your lashes, so it&#x27;s not just some petroleum base goo that rubs off over the course of the day--which is a big problem for me.  There is some minor clump factor, but any mascara that makes your lashed go VAVOOM is bound to do that.  I have sparse Asian eyelashes and this mascara definitely make my lashes stand out better than any other.  The only drawback is that because it stays on so well, it&#x27;s kind of hard to take off with traditional makeup remover.  But the makeup saleslady said that heat makes the tubes expand, so now I either wash my face with warm water or take a hot shower and slough off the mascara with my finger, which is actually easier than going through my usual vasaline and toilet paper makeup removal routine!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara - and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of them.  It glides on thickly, but you can go back over quickly with the brush, and it&#x27;s easy to spread any lashes that stick together.  Lengthens and thickens lashes very well.  It doesn&#x27;t fade, which is very important to me.  Removing it is pretty easy, sometimes I even start by peeling it off (it coats your lashes with little tubes) and I find this very satisfying.  I then wipe the rest off with regular makeup remover.  Also, I wear contacts and it has never irritated them.  All-around fantastic mascara!</li>
    <li> NO clumps  NO smearing  NO raccoon eyes in the morning or after a sweaty workout  Easy to use and apply.  Wahes off with warm water and washcloth.  The longest thickest looking lashes I&#x27;ve ever experienced short of falsies.</li>
    <li> Loved this! the first couple applications were hard cause the brush is fat and can cause lashes to clump a bit, but it&#x27;s not bad. You just have to learn how much to apply. But YES, my lashes look long and full. I am always looking for a great mascara and I think I found mine :o)</li>
    <li> I definitely love this mascara. It&#x27;s important to me that my lashes are long, thick, and dramatic . . . this achieves that effect. This mascara also gives you less of a racoon eye in the morning if you fall asleep wearing your mascara. Another thing that I like, a lot, about this mascara is that it&#x27;s buildable . . . so you can make your lashes as dramatic as you&#x27;d like, without making them look like tarantula legs (just make sure to start at the base of your lashes and wiggle the brush upward as your applying). I&#x27;ve tried almost every mascara on the planet and this is certainly one of my top picks.    The lash brush might be a little big for some, but if you find it difficult to maneuver, one of my favorite tricks with mascara is to pull the wand almost all the way out of the tube (so that just the brush part is in the tube) and gently bend the wand (at the beginning up the bristle part) against the tube, so that the end of the wand is at a 45 degree angle. It will stay this way for a long as you like (if you don&#x27;t like it, you can always bend it back), won&#x27;t break off in the tube, and will make applying your mascara much easier and less of a mess.</li>
    <li> I have some good news and some bad news about this product. Starting with the good news first. I love how it extends your lashes to make them look glamourous and how it makes your eyes stick out. The bad news is the brush is sort of intimidating in size wise. You have to bend it in order for it to coat your lashes. And another thing, is it smears!!!!! I don&#x27;t like it when mascara smears! Overall, its an okay product but just not as amazing as some people make it out to be. But then again, this is just my opinion.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 3 stars b/c it does go on nicely.  It isn&#x27;t quite as fabolous as the manufacture describes it though.  My lashes don&#x27;t look particulary long or \\&quot;fake\\&quot; or standout with it on.  The thing I liked most about it was that it doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear, which is espically nice when I&#x27;m working out.</li>
    <li> Stinks - as in smells really bad.  Thought the mascara was bad... once I get past that - I like it.  Good, couple coats gives nice, full lashes.  Not the falsh eyelash look I was hoping for, but good nonetheless.  Really does stay put quite well.  I would recommend, but not rave.</li>
    <li> I got this product thinking it would be a non-Japanese version of Kiss Me mascara (maybe easier to find since I don&#x27;t live near a Sephora or a Japanese drugstore). WRONG. This mascara, though it works on the same lash-tubing principle, flaked badly on me, especially when rubbed. It also smeared if I rubbed while sweaty. It smelled like acrylic nails to me. The brush was big and hard to use. It&#x27;s still better than your average mascara just because of the tubing formula (no panda eyes, removes super easily), but among the three tubing formulas I&#x27;ve tried (Blinc&#x27;s Kiss Me, Imju Fiberwig, Lash Injection), it&#x27;s definitely the worst.</li>
    <li> This is a good mascara at first but after a few uses it starts to flake and leaves little pieces under my eyes. I like that it gives a lot of volume to my lashes and it lasts a long time otherwise.  It would be great if not for the flaking.</li>
    <li> I am 45 and still looking for the great mascara. Not this one . In my opinion, it didn&#x27;t do what it claims it can do. I wanted smudge proof and did not get smudge proof. I got bits of black and some smudges. I laugh a lot and so after a few hours I checked and no it didn&#x27;t pass my laugh test. I know this might come across as strange , using a laugh test, but hey I have 1 mascara that right now has passed the test and its from Loreal. Its not water proof but water resistant. This product is water proof. I had a very hard time getting it off but yet it managed to find it&#x27;s way on my lower lash skin after a few hours grrrrrr!!!!!I had such a hard time getting it off , I still had mascara the next day on my lashes. Also, its too clumpy. Maybe its just the 1 I bought but it had way too much product on the brush so I had to remove a lot before I could even start.In my opinion , if we are gonna spend this kind of money on a mascara , it had better do all and more. I buy the Loreal water resistant mascara now. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores so I have to order it on-line. Oh Well!! Well worth it considering I have no smudges and mine is easier to take off.</li>
    <li> I first received Too Faced Lash Injection as a sample mini tube and loved it. I&#x27;ve never had a mascara which not only thickens and lengthens but doesn&#x27;t flake and clump and no \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;!   After a full day of wear it&#x27;s still there!    I wear the color Pitch Black and find that it&#x27;s not too harsh of a black to wear.  Some mascaras I have to go for a lighter black because their black is too black and stands out.  I don&#x27;t want it to be obvious that I&#x27;m wearing mascara!    When I first started wearing Too Faced Lash Injection I wore eye glasses but in the last two months I&#x27;ve switched over to contact lenses so I&#x27;m relieved that I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this mascara flaking.  I&#x27;ve not had any problems wearing contacts with this formula.     My usual method of applying this mascara is to apply one coat to the top lashes of one eye and move to the next.  After I apply to the bottom lashes of the first eye and then the next and repeat the process.  This allows the formula to dry a bit between coats.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I have tried dozens upon dozens of mascara&#x27;s in my lifetime. I&#x27;ve gone with Mabelline, Loreal, Lancome, Benefit, Aveda, Wet and WIld (actually pretty darn good) and have finally found the best one on the planet! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This mascara goes on easy- &lt;br /&gt;It seperates your lashes into sexy little strands. &lt;br /&gt;It looks really clean- NO CLUMPS! &lt;br /&gt;It stays put all day. &lt;br /&gt;It does not and I mean, it really really REALLY doesn&#x27;t run.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I live in Hawaii. It&#x27;s hot. We sweat. We go in the ocean. Waterproof mascara? HA! Puh-lease! THIS STUFF ACTUALLY IS WATERPROOF. No racoon eyes- EVER. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only gripe that I have is that it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look as full as the formula&#x27;s where you put a base on first and then the actual mascara... But then again, those tend to clump and smear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh well, you can&#x27;t have it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am 45, so I have tried SOOOO many mascaras in my lifetime. This one does not irritate my eyes, as most others do. But more importantly, Too Faced does not run!! All the others do (I have used expensive highly recommended mascaras such as DiorShow waterproof, but for me, this is better.) It does just what it is supposed to do, and does not run all day, yet is not hard to take off with regular face cleanser.</li>
    <li> I went to a beauty store and was told to try this mascara.  I was a little freaked out by them saying it put tubes on my lashes.  So, I put it in a drawer and continued to use my old mascara, until I couldn&#x27;t get another drop.  Before using Too Faced, I was using Smashbox primer with Bare Essentials mascara(the one with the lash separator).  I like that, but didn&#x27;t feel like my lashes looked longer, just fuller.   Skeptical, I tried the Too Faced.  I can not even begin to tell you how excited I am about this mascara!    With this one product, I get the fullness of the other two products AND my lashes look LONGER!  I have no idea how it works, but I know what it does.     The rep. at the beauty store told me how to apply it.  They said to put on one coat at a time.  So I do one eye, then the other and then I go back and do the first one again.  They said the more coats you put on, the bigger and longer your lashes will look.  The wand is large and a little intimidating, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.  Do a light coat from bottom of your lashes to the top.  There is no clumping.  Honestly, my eyes still look good after a night of sleeping on them!  When has that EVER happened?   Try it.  It&#x27;s new, it&#x27;s different, but it works amazingly!  There are no clumps, no blotches, no lashes sticking together.....just big, thick gorgeous lashes that appear like magic!!!!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best mascara ever!  I have tried about every type, and this one is the best. 1. It makes your lashes look great. 2. It never smudges 3. It is fine for my very sensitive eyes!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. The mascara goes on smoothly and is virtually clump-free. You can apply one quick coat for a more subtle look or multiple coats for more dramatic results. It stays put and looks great all day. This is definitely one of the best mascara products I&#x27;ve used so far. (One random note: It does have a rather strong perfume-like smell to it that I didn&#x27;t expect at first. It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just different from other mascaras that way. I still love it!)</li>
