      <li>It holds hair very nice.</li>
      <li>and it leaves your hair bright.    </li>
      <li>Consort For Men Non-Aerosol Hair Spray is a good product for those of you who use spray instead of mousse or gel.  </li>

      <li>good product, very satisfied.</li>

      <li>Appreciate being able to  order on Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>The thing I like most about the product is</li>
      <li>This product is okay</li>
      <li>My husband has used this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>keep in touch when I run out to reorder more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair sprays over the years.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>With a better nozzle, fit would be better.</li>
      <li>: It lasted about 3-4 month which I consider to be pretty good regarding the cheap price.    </li>
      <li>Strong scent and</li>
      <li>My hair is wispy fine</li>
      <li>My hair is too fine for &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>He is super pleased with it &amp; doesnt smell like a girl when he uses it.</li>
      <li>I like the nonevent but &amp;#34;Extra Hold&amp;#34; does not keep fine hair from flying in light breeze.</li>
      <li>pretty as ever. :)</li>
      <li>Great spray, holds hair in place all day long</li>
      <li>First and foremost: It&#x27;s inconcievably cheap!</li>
      <li>price is good and it does technically work.</li>
      <li>The Consort, unscented, extra hold is good for holding and has no smell.  </li>
      <li>Most sprays have way too much \\&quot;hold\\&quot; for me.</li>
      <li>This spray does an adequate job.</li>
      <li>Good product with strong holding power with little fragrance....</li>
      <li>In closing I can only recommend this product: You won&#x27;t get anything better for that price !</li>
      <li>I tried numerous different types of hairspray and neither of them did a very good job:</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I was looking for a hairspray which would fit my wants.</li>
      <li>Has a distinct smell althought the packaging says &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>And even though it says it is unscented - it has a distinct smell.</li>
      <li>I have used this product Consort for me and it is right for my use</li>
      <li>The Hair spray itself is great as long as you do not buy the pump action version.</li>
      <li>You really need to spray a lot of this for it to be effective, even on short hair like mine.</li>
      <li>So, I decided to try Amazon and sure enough, it was in stock.  </li>
      <li>First - I do not like the Consort aerosol hair spray at all.</li>
      <li>I would prefer if Consort added some healthy ingredients that would nourish the hair follicle such as biotin, if they do that my rating of this product would become a 5 rating.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product, but I wish I would have known to have gone for a stronger hold variant before I made the purchase.</li>
      <li>as good a product as more expensive sprays.</li>
      <li>Just a light push on the spray head is generally all that&#x27;s needed.</li>
      <li>I ordered this over a number of other brands based on the positive reviews, and I am satisfied, but not 100%.</li>
      <li>frankly doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
      <li>It holds hair in place very well.  </li>
      <li>I prefer this non-aerosol version because it allows control over how much is applied.</li>
      <li>Either it was much too sticky or it had that penetrating odor.    </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I was never much for hairspray and often found my fine hair would be all over on a windy day</li>
      <li>About 3 bucks for that is a pretty decent bargain, and it&#x27;s not that it doesn&#x27;t last lang..</li>
      <li>But, if I&#x27;m going to live in the bathroom, there&#x27;s hardly&lt;</li>
      <li>This \\&quot;extra hold\\&quot; product ranks third best as far as hold capability in the Consort line of hair spray products, behind the \\&quot;mega hold\\&quot; and \\&quot;extreme hold\\&quot; hair sprays.  </li>
      <li>Since I have very thin blonde hair, gel or wax don&#x27;t do any good; they just make my hair look greasy and dim.</li>
      <li>Does not dull my grey hair.</li>

    <li> I use hairspray. My hair is too fine for &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;. Was not able to find men&#x27;s hair spray (still a little embarrassed to admit I use it) at two large retail box stores. I bought through Amazon Prime and, presto-chango, only a few days later my hair was as...ahem...pretty as ever. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years and have been very satisfied with it. It was introduced to me by a barber in California and I have been using it since.  The thing I like most about the product is that it dosn&#x27;t get stickey. I prefer the non-aerosol spray to the aerosol type even though I have used both.</li>
    <li> This product is okay but no better than any other hairspray.  And even though it says it is unscented - it has a distinct smell.</li>
    <li> First - I do not like the Consort aerosol hair spray at all. But the pump-spray bottle of the Consort hair spray works great. I don&#x27;t know why the aerosol version is so bad????</li>
    <li> This hair spray works as advertized. As opposed to some of the other reviewers, I like the aerosol version of this product, as the non aerosol sprayer does get stuck frequently and then will spray a stream in a random direction such as my wall instead of my hair, when that happens I cannot get the sprayer to stop sticking, even using hot water, so I have to throw the bottle in the trash. I would prefer if Consort added some healthy ingredients that would nourish the hair follicle such as biotin, if they do that my rating of this product would become a 5 rating. Overall I like the aerosol version of this product and will contine to use, but may switch over to one of the other mens versions that include biotin after they lower their prices.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does everything I want this type of product to do. After ordering only one as a test sample, I intend to order it in multiples.</li>
    <li> Consort For Men Non-Aerosol Hair Spray is a good product for those of you who use spray instead of mousse or gel.  There is no stiffness, no stickiness, no aerosol, no scent, and no hassle.  It holds hair in place very well.  This \\&quot;extra hold\\&quot; product ranks third best as far as hold capability in the Consort line of hair spray products, behind the \\&quot;mega hold\\&quot; and \\&quot;extreme hold\\&quot; hair sprays.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this over a number of other brands based on the positive reviews, and I am satisfied, but not 100%. You really need to spray a lot of this for it to be effective, even on short hair like mine. It holds for a few hours, then fails a bit later, requiring more spray. Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product, but I wish I would have known to have gone for a stronger hold variant before I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a hairspray for my husband that worked and did not have aerosol since I have asthma.  This is the best one we have found.</li>
    <li> Hair spray was received promptly.  My husband has used this product for many years.  Appreciate being able to  order on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Since I have very thin blonde hair, gel or wax don&#x27;t do any good; they just make my hair look greasy and dim. That&#x27;s why I was looking for a hairspray which would fit my wants. I tried numerous different types of hairspray and neither of them did a very good job: Either it was much too sticky or it had that penetrating odor.    But eventually I came to this product here: First and foremost: It&#x27;s inconcievably cheap! About 3 bucks for that is a pretty decent bargain, and it&#x27;s not that it doesn&#x27;t last lang..quite the contrary: It lasted about 3-4 month which I consider to be pretty good regarding the cheap price.    What I also like is that it isn&#x27;t sticky after all after you put it on. You can even comb your hair afterwards if you didn&#x27;t use it too excessively.  Moreover it doesn&#x27;t smell at all and it leaves your hair bright.    In closing I can only recommend this product: You won&#x27;t get anything better for that price !</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my husband who uses Consort.  We like the pump rather than aerosol and could not find it in any of the local stores.  It&#x27;s a good men&#x27;s hairspray.</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  Strong scent and frankly doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  Wouldn&#x27;t rebuy</li>
    <li> I like the nonevent but &amp;#34;Extra Hold&amp;#34; does not keep fine hair from flying in light breeze.</li>
    <li> the local stores have discontinued this item on there shelfs, not sure why&lt;br /&gt;thanks a lot&lt;br /&gt;will keep in touch when I run out to reorder more</li>
    <li> I have used the Consort spray bottle for years, but I have been trying to find it for over a year now since Walmart stopped carrying it.  I finally found the spray bottle at a Publix supermarket in Florida for $3.49.  Consort is the best mens hairspray bar none regardless of price.</li>
    <li> I coudn&#x27;t find this hair spray anywere.  Walmart carries it but they have been out of stock for quite sometime.  So, I decided to try Amazon and sure enough, it was in stock.  This is an excellent hair spray for men.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was never much for hairspray and often found my fine hair would be all over on a windy day so I gave it a try. Works well to keep it in place and with no noticeable fragrance or stickiness. I will probably want to try some other brand for comparison in the future.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to.  The spray nozzle is a little coarse.  With a better nozzle, fit would be better.</li>
    <li> as good a product as more expensive sprays. Does not dull my grey hair. My hair is thick and coarse and has a mind of its own, so generally difficult to control. This spray does an adequate job.</li>
    <li> Delivery and product met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Meh...kinda sticky, uneven spray.</li>
    <li> The Consort For Men of old always smelled so bad.  It got to you after four or five hours and you wondered if people are smelling the same stench you did.  The Consort, unscented, extra hold is good for holding and has no smell.  It works great for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair sprays over the years. My hair is wispy fine so it needs something to keep it in place. Most sprays have way too much \\&quot;hold\\&quot; for me. Consort used conservatively can look like you&#x27;re not using a spray at all. I prefer this non-aerosol version because it allows control over how much is applied. Just a light push on the spray head is generally all that&#x27;s needed.</li>
    <li> Item was sent promptly I am very happy with this product. It holds hair very nice. It is not sticky.</li>
    <li> good product, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this for years, but we can not find the non-aerosol one in stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;He would recommend it to friends and family if anyone was looking for this type of product.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it does the job.  Keeps my hair in place.  Claims not to be stiffen hair but it does.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item here on Amazon because my local drug stores don&#x27;t seem to carry it.I use to use the aerosol version of consort years ago when i had alot of hair to hold in place.Now i just use it to hold what&#x27;s left of my hair in place.Good product with strong holding power with little fragrance....</li>
    <li> i guess this was around during his time....I had never heard of it.  Found it here &amp; bought it for him.  He is super pleased with it &amp; doesnt smell like a girl when he uses it.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray my husband uses.</li>
    <li> Does not really hold. Has a distinct smell althought the packaging says &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Since Pantene discontinued MY unscented, pro-v hair glue that I&#x27;ve used forever, I&#x27;m now stuck in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy something, so I bought this Consort for men. The excess spray hit the floor&lt;br /&gt;and my feet are now permanently glued to the floor. My wife had to bring the wireless laptop&lt;br /&gt;in for me to write this review. Oh, I also don&#x27;t like the stink this spray makes. It may be stated&lt;br /&gt;to be unscented, but it has a nauseating smell when it goes on. Other than those two minor issues,&lt;br /&gt;the price is good and it does technically work. But, if I&#x27;m going to live in the bathroom, there&#x27;s hardly&lt;br /&gt;any point to spiffing up my hair...there&#x27;s nobody in here to impress.</li>
    <li> I have used this product Consort for me and it is right for my use, It is not sticky and there is no odour,&lt;br /&gt;and keeps my hair in place.</li>
    <li> I hated it because it does not come out properly in the non-aerosol version.  The Hair spray itself is great as long as you do not buy the pump action version.</li>
    <li> Great spray, holds hair in place all day long</li>
    <li> Not happy with product</li>
