      <li>Thank you for your quick response!</li>
      <li>I bought the set, and LOVE that it is fragrance free because I have sensitive skin that breaks out in rashes very easily, and I don&#x27;t need perfumes in my soap or lotions.</li>
      <li>the fact that my elbows have lost their callouses  and my hands look younger than I am instead of older is just a wonderful added plus.</li>

      <li>my hands were nice and soft not rough</li>
      <li>It is so quick and easy to use and my hands go from very rough to smooth and soft  quickly.</li>
      <li>I first received a small gift set, and loved it so much that I bought some for myself, and another set for my mom.  </li>
      <li>Hands are super soft after using this product.</li>
      <li>an official independent consultant to ensure that you receive fresh, full product.</li>

      <li>thank you for little gifts inside :)</li>
      <li>and my hands are baby soft!  </li>
      <li>The first time I tried this set, it was given to me as a sample, and I washed my hands like normal all day long</li>
      <li>She has found this a way to help her hands feel soft again.</li>
      <li>Just as the product name implies, my hands feel incredibly soft after using the set.  </li>
      <li>When I used the product my hands did feel satinly soft.  </li>
      <li>I just completely love the look of my hands, now, and as a health care professional, I wash my hands constantly and work with anti-bacterial agents and rubbing alcohol and it dried my skin out before I started using these products.</li>
      <li>and they stayed super soft all day long, and looked amazingly younger!</li>
      <li>Every time my hands touch water, they get so dry, specially the finger tips where the skin sometimes gets a cut just from being dry.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s just the general health of my skin,</li>
      <li>Now, I can wash my hands all day long and still have young, supple, soft hands all day.</li>
      <li>I only use the sensitive formula.</li>
      <li>I first used a version of this Mary Kay product a few years ago.  </li>
