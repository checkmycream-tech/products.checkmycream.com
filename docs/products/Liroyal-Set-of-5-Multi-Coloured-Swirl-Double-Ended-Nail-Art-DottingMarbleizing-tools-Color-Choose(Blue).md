<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What can I say? It was a little over a dollar, and I got 5 neat tools to give my sister as a gift to do her nails with! Mine all arrived as different sizes-other reviews read differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was shipping took FOREVER. Over a month. Direct from China.</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are fun, easy to use, and come in a variety of sizes to fit your creative needs. I recommend them to anybody who loves designing nails.</li>
    <li> This matches exactly in the photo, its pretty and works very well. The only issue that i have with this is.... This took a whole MONTH to arrive! But other then that, i love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured.  Look to be good quality, will be using them for my polymer clay jewelry creations.</li>
    <li> Nice variety of sizes.  Handles are a hard plastic and hold up to nail polish remover well.  Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Nice product for my wife. About 3 of the tools almost looked like the same size dotting part. My wife assured me they were all different. Took about a month to receive the product.  Decent quality and overall good product for the price,  happy wife &#x3D; happy life.</li>
    <li> These nail designers came much faster than expected and work great! They are easy to use and clean and I love using them. I would recommend these to anyone who likes to do nail designs.</li>
    <li> They do not come with instructions for use and were worthless to me.</li>
    <li> Two of them come in broken.......</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, good product, love it ☆☆☆☆☆</li>
    <li> They get the job done.. Good product easy to use</li>
    <li> Although there&#x27;re 5 dotting pens and 10 different size dots in a pack, it doesn&#x27;t show that much different. I need bigger dot. But these pack can&#x27;t meet my needs.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, so it worths it, you can actually make perfect dot.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and really good quality. There&#x27;s really not much to say, the sizes are great because they vary and its easy to distinguish them due to the colours.</li>
    <li> My nails look so pretty now! Thanks to this product, I can beautify the nails of my girl friends and spread the art to others.</li>
    <li> They are just as described, and no&lt;br /&gt;damages. Shipped promptly, and arrived before quoted arrival.&lt;br /&gt;My wife really enjoys using them.</li>
    <li> great price and it comes perfectly as it is shown. I like this product a lot. Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Great for the price! I love these! They are colorful, useful, and work well.... they come in the different sizes and are super cheap.</li>
    <li> Very nice dotting set. Great price for a beginner set. Came sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> My daughters really like these.</li>
    <li> The ONLY reason I gave them four stars was because two of the tips fell out of the tool itself. But I use them like crazy, so I understood. The design is cool, and for under 3 dollars, I have no other complaints. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed&lt;br /&gt;Just what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;Great product&lt;br /&gt;would definitely buy again! .&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> These are nice dotting tools.  It is only 6 different sizes.  Nice to hold, pretty colors and they do the job.  Arrived 3 weeks ahead of the promised arrival date, which was fantastic.  Very low price, good value.</li>
    <li> Well this was also my first time hearing about it or using one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still hard for me to use because it&#x27;s my first but I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already done a few peices on my nails from &amp;#34;youtube videos&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s so cool! I love the feeling after it&#x27;s all done and it&#x27;s so ASWOME!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use these nail art tools very much, but I did try creating a polk-a-dot design with them using the small and big balls on the end of the 2 tools. The application of nail polish using the ball ends were pretty messy, and didn&#x27;t leave a clean polk-a-dot, I had to reply again and again just to make a full circle. :(</li>
    <li> It was great I always go to stores and there so expensive so I looked on Amazon and I found them also they came really early I ordered them last week and the design is just perfect</li>
    <li> They are awesom tools for nail dotting decorating. Very light, durable too eventhough its looks like plastic I had dropped it a couple times accidentally air first then down the stairs WITH and WITHOUT the tools in the pouch thinking that the tools were gonna break, but I guess not. Wipe off easy after use. I recommend these cheap dotting tools to anyone to their mani/ pedi addition.</li>
    <li> I love these little pens! They are perfect for making poka-dots, and drawing lines or whatever your want! They are small so they will fit anywhere. They are easy to clean as well. These are so fun, especially if you have little girls that love their nails done :)</li>
    <li> These feel surprisingly heavy and high-quality. And to get them for $1.96, punctual shipping included, all the way from China? While it raises questions about global economics, the value is clear. Clearer than my dotting technique, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I love these dotters. I use them all the time and they are easy to clean and work so good. very happy with them</li>
    <li> They work great! fit perfectly in my hands i just did a few peoples nails and the dots can be made into flowers so everyone wants some now :D totally recommend if you like doing nail art!!</li>
    <li> Work for their purpose.  Not made terribly well, as the metal piece has already fallen out of a few.  But not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> love them! lucky enough to find the the tips are different in every pencil (you know, not the same ending in every one), the package was great! every one of them are in perfect shape, so happy about them :)</li>
    <li> they all look the same.</li>
    <li> these work great! a simple and effective tool that is cheap, durable, pretty and does the job perfectly. double ended, many sizes to choose from, fine and bigger designs. easy to clean and store! a must have for any nail polish lover. good for simple and complex designs.</li>
    <li> Loved these they are perfect for dotting nails &amp; anything with nails art its a great product ibloved hownit was packaged and I keep the tools in the pouch after every use. Reqlly easy to clean also</li>
    <li> great dotting tools and with a the price you can&#x27;t beat! I have been have lots of fun with them making all kinds of new designs!</li>
    <li> Sorry, I took a long time to write a review but I am new in this.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great to do my art nail design.</li>
    <li> they are so cute and the designs are beautiful!... the sizes are so useful and awesome!! they make all sizes of dots that you can thin of!</li>
    <li> I finally got my dotting tools today after waiting anxiously for 2 weeks without tracking! I am happy with the product for the price I paid. I only have three problems... my phone number was on the front of my package, one of the tools only had one ball, and another tools ball was messed up, but I am happy with the different size ball. Thank you for your service! Will be using these very soon! I wish I would have waited one more day to do my nails though, but I couldn&#x27;t wait any longer!</li>
    <li> the actual dotting part came off but it was easily fixed I love the assortment of colors though. I thought they would be bigger but  that doesn&#x27;t matter. Works great even though the dotting part  came off.</li>
    <li> Great bargain!  I got a pack of 5 dotting tools for .09!  Fast shipping!  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Takes about a month to get from China/over seas.</li>
    <li> Love these!! But after having them for a while, the medal part comes out which itsnt good because i lost 2 already.. I have to super glue the rest before they get lost as well</li>
    <li> Great tools fast shipping worth your money</li>
    <li> They were good. They did their purpose nicely. It&#x27;s a nice gift to give someone who is starting out in nail art.</li>
    <li> used it to make the faces on the bear sugar cookies ..perfect eyes ..nose...</li>
    <li> These Dotting Pens are the best nail tools ever! It is so easy to make the different types of dots or the different designs that you want. :)</li>
    <li> This products takes a little while to receive. However, the same exact tools are available at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for 8.00; I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay that much for them. I love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing nail art for some time now, and this product is really helpful! The pens are well made and come in virtually any size that you&#x27;d need. They are beautiful and functional, what else could you ask for? I would highly recommend this product and this seller!</li>
    <li> These are great. Did not cost a lot. I use these on a regular basis. They do their job and make very nice perfect dots with any nail polish.</li>
    <li> Work great. One cracked in half, but, hay, for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> they are pretty good.</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I did a comparison test using a toothpick and this product &amp; they were quite similiar. The problem with this tool is that you need to clean it after because there will be dried up nail polish on it. Using a toothpick or some other disposable item, would be easier because you could just throw it away.</li>
    <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
    <li> Surprisingly sturdy for the price. All different sizes with no duplicates.</li>
    <li> nice and heavy. seem well made. would have been nice if they came with a little bag for storage, but for the price i wouldnt expect anything extra. I can buy one at the dollar store. These are the exact same ones that are for sale at sallys beauty supply for $10!!!&lt;br /&gt;perfect for making cute designs on your nails. the colors are actually very pretty in person. they look like glass.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these for polymer clay. They all seem the same size to me.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Totally worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Broke, the first time I used them.</li>
    <li> I waited 6 weeks to get these things! But well worth the wait... Been able to make cute flower designs a hearts! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who loves doing nails. She is happy with my purchase but disappointed that it took so long to arrive.</li>
    <li> A must for a beginner in nail art.  This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; tool.</li>
    <li> Daughter very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> These are great for making those small polka-dots I want on my nails. They aren&#x27;t that easy to clean with cotton balls. I always miss the edges for some reason. The sizes are great and can help with any design you&#x27;re looking to create that includes dots of any kind. The colors are not only cute but help to remember which sizes of dots you can make with each tool. They aren&#x27;t too big and aren&#x27;t too small. They&#x27;re probably about the size of a standard mechanical pencil. These are great tools and I would recommend them to any nail artist.</li>
    <li> They are smaller than I thought but work really well when i dont &amp;#34;trip&amp;#34; over my own hands.</li>
    <li> very colorful and comfortable to hold, different sizes, the best useful for making dots, maybe some creative lines:) I like it</li>
    <li> I love to play with my nails and these help me get it done nicely.  They are very handy when either I am in rush and need to have a few quick polka dots or some fancy nail designs.  They are very sturdy and hold up well since I have had them for many years and still haven&#x27;t seen any worn out signs.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools seem to be well made and high quality. I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to try them yet, but the shipping was super fast and the customer service was great. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> They are really good and for the price too</li>
    <li> These are great and pretty. Definitely a bargain</li>
    <li> Makes nail art so easy! Arrived fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Great nail art dotters! Love them, can&#x27;t really beat the price either. The range in size of dots that can be created is awesome, would buy again if necessary!</li>
    <li> This arrived much earlier than I expected! The product itself was great!!</li>
    <li> Maybe for an expert they&#x27;d be good, but I&#x27;m a novice and I felt they all basically did the same thing.</li>
    <li> I bought these little guys for just over $2. I&#x27;ve been wanting some nail art dotters for a while now, and I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price. I think they are neat looking, and I like that they&#x27;re different colors so I know which one to go for. Might grab a few more of these as gifts.</li>
    <li> i would totally buy a new pack and the author send it to me really early</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t get a good variety of sizes in this pack</li>
    <li> These are cute and work for decorating nails. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the metal slips right out of the handle.</li>
    <li> They were different for the first set I ordered and one set was incomplete.</li>
    <li> love it. I was looking for an inexpensive dotting tool to do my daughters nails. We are having fun creating many designs..</li>
    <li> These were super cheap and arrived looking exactly like the photo. Double ended with different sizes and colors. There are some size duplicates (one one of the ends) but overall it is a complete set. The shipping took a long time, but for less than $2 for a whole set I have no problem waiting. One of my friends bought this a few years ago and she was sent a set of 5 of the same tools. I am hoping this was an issue they had awhile ago and its not a problem anymore. I am glad I bought them because they are easy to use to make little nail designs and easier to hold on to than a bent bobby pin (a good dotting tool supplement).</li>
    <li> These were so inexpensive and easy to use.  One of the tips fell out of one thus the reduced stars.</li>
    <li> My daughter couldn&#x27;t wait to receiving her dotting kit and when she did, she just loves it!!! I really recommend this item. Delivery was sooner than what I anticipated and because of this I give it more pluses. :D</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s Ok. grate nail polish... but they were TINY TINY TINY i mean u could get 3 uses out of them tops and i bite my nails to the numb if they were a dollor i might get them</li>
    <li> works great, shipping/arrival time was a BEAR!</li>
    <li> These marbleizing/dotting tools are fantastic! I used to have a hard time making dots and straight lines, but these pens basically make it impossible to mess up. Every girl needs them.</li>
    <li> There great! They work really good and ship fast I orders a couple other things for my nails and these were the first things I got they only took about a week. I would recommend them they are great.</li>
    <li> I got them in such an amazing time! They work amazing!! I love them sooo much!! They are my new favorite things to use!!</li>
    <li> I love these, they have come in handy for my many nail projects. I would recommend this set to anyone.</li>
    <li> These pens are great! They are very sturdy and well made. The size of the dots are perfect. I would recommend these to anyone who would like to add flair to their nails.</li>
    <li> Easy to work with and they came it a not so flimsy case that I just put them back into so they don&#x27;t roll around in all my nail art junk.</li>
    <li> this is nice but it took to long to come.</li>
    <li> It very greate nothin bad to say and I love how the top swirls when u do art designs but is very good</li>
    <li> Not expensive, different sizes for my different designs, easy to work with, but the one end on all tools are the same size, so really only 5 or 6 dot sizes but it beats using a toothpick to create my designs and art.</li>
    <li> I ordered theses and used them and they worked amazingly! But I ordered them in August  and they came really late in September. I got paranoid but when they came I was excited to use them and they worked great!</li>
    <li> N e v e r g o t t h e m</li>
    <li> Made everything easier. Easy to clean. Would my again from them. They are double sided with different sizes on each side.</li>
    <li> A lot of very little tips on these. I wish there was a larger selection of bigger sizes. The super tiny ones seem almost useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the larger sizes work GREAT :) I can do everything I need to with these.</li>
    <li> i would definitely recommend this product.I got it before the shipping date which was nice. It also works very well &amp; its super cheap, you can do so many things with this products not just dots, it is just a great tool to use when adding a design  to your nails :)</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves doing her nails with this set and thinks they are great</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be, but still seem to be how the seller describes them.</li>
    <li> This tool works great but you need to put nail polish on it fast because otherwise it will be kinda gloppy on the nail.</li>
    <li> Great tools. Was sent right out.</li>
    <li> took like 1 month shipped from china,for the quality you know you can imagine cause its made in china.</li>
    <li> I love designing my nails with dots this is a great product and great quality as well. I also love the different sizes they come in.</li>
    <li> Just what i needed and came in perfect condition.  Great Price too.  They had good sizes and work great.  good product.</li>
    <li> I got mine early than expected, very satisfied and the use too. 🙌</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that these matched the professional  dotters I saw in my DIY Nail art book. work perfectly, shipped fast!</li>
    <li> I thought it was okay because the smaller dotter hardly made a dot, while the big dotter made way to big of a dot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome and i received it way before the eta!</li>
    <li> cheap simple easy to use, would recommend to any beginners to nail art and design, comes in a few different sizes</li>
    <li> I created so many different things on my nails with this.  Now we have nail parties.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping ( two weeks before estimated) they feel well built and sturdy. You do receive 5 two way dotters, but the thing is you only get 4 diffrent sizes. One end are all diffrent, the other end all the same ( the tiniest size) basically one end are all the same size as the yellow dotter. Other then that I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> These tools not only make dots but I have done  swirling designs as well.  I may order another set for my grandaughter.  Items recieved before scheduled delivery date.</li>
    <li> These arrived about 2 weeks after we purchased them. They are just like what you find in stores, so the quality is very nice.</li>
    <li> I ordered these November 14 and just received them Dec 2. felt like it took forever to get here bc i couldn&#x27;t wait iv wanted these forever. I&#x27;m very satisfied with them. got all five colors just like in the picture. there&#x27;s 7 or 8 different sizes not ten but that&#x27;s more than i had in the first place. the only problem i had was one of them looks like it has been glued back in, but that&#x27;s not hurting anything. I will order from them again, anytime.</li>
    <li> Like these alot to create different nail designs. Very useful in nail arts. I&#x27;d recommend! No problems with these.. Has them since sept.</li>
    <li> They took a while to show up but they&#x27;re exactly as pictured!</li>
    <li> perfect! we use these weekly!</li>
    <li> Does the job and gives you many options for nail design.</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase! Thank u!</li>
    <li> It came much earlier than expected and it came with two packets which is 20 dotting tools they are so useful</li>
    <li> Work great for designing! Love them!</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected they are small but I think they might be handled better because they&#x27;re smaller so good looks!</li>
    <li> I was a little leary to purchase these as I saw reviews saying that many of the tips were the same size. I have not found any tips to be the same size, and I have used these frequently. Has worked wonders when painting my nieces nails to add a little fun for them! Definitely recommend these for those who want to create their own art for their nails.</li>
    <li> I use these on my nail designs. I love the way they are simple to use, with the dotting tool, having two dottings, at the end of one tool, makes it easy to use, when designing.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 2!</li>
    <li> I do my nails myself and after watching a few tutorials I realized I really needed these tools to accomplish a certain pattern I wanted to try. They are easy to use and easy to clean up and pretty durable!</li>
    <li> Saw these on Youtube and decided to give them a try. For under $3 I figured it&#x27;d be hard to go wrong, and I was right. Buying this should be a no-brainer for anyone interested in nail art.</li>
    <li> I want to say that this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve bought. The price IS AWESOME. Even though the seller says it would take up to four-six weeks to deliver, it only took 2. Even better!</li>
    <li> Nice tools for nail art. This is my second time ordering this set.</li>
    <li> As promised all the way around!</li>
    <li> I love this product, very easy to use, no damages from shipping. Very pleased!! Will definitely recommend to others who may need this product!!</li>
    <li> great i really enjoyed this item its perfect for nail art and inexpensive vould not have found a better deal</li>
    <li> My daugther is now into nail art and  is using these instead of  toothpick, bobby pins or my pens. These are great and they are easy to hold</li>
    <li> They definitely make my life easier with painting perfect dots on my nails. They come in different sizes &amp; i got compliments on my nails from using them. I am more than happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Can be used for clay and nail art. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. So cute!</li>
    <li> Convenient but one pen is missing nail! So I can use only 4 pens! I like this but missing nail make me upset !</li>
    <li> Nice quality, very happy with produce and it arrive well before the anticipated arrival date.</li>
    <li> Omg love these tools they are such good qulity! And I also loved the price</li>
    <li> I use these bad boys more than I thought I would!  Besides dotting, they are great for &amp;#34;coloring in&amp;#34; designs if you do nail stamping.  They are all different sizes and work well for doing nail art.</li>
    <li> Love these! I&#x27;ve done so many cool designs since I got the dotting tools. They said it would take about a month to receive but it was only about two weeks.</li>
    <li> Just got these pad today, open the package one was already broke. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Works well for making dots!</li>
    <li> great gift, and for a good price and shipping speed!</li>
    <li> The Shipping Was Fast! For me they arrived less than a week, which was awesome. It comes in a small cardboard envelope. These five dotting tools work soo good! They look excataly how the picture shows. Not only are they super cute, but they make great sized dots and all different sizes! They are also very easy to clean. If you clean it right after your done using it them you can just wipe it off, and it still comes out just as clean. I absolutely love this product and i highly recommend it!!! If you enjoy painting your nails and making them extra cute, then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I used to use the head of a bobby pin to paint polka dots on my daughters&#x27; nails... now I have these incredibly inexpensive little tools!  The tips vary in size for design versatility.  With a little imagination, I&#x27;m sure you could use these for MANY different designs and without much effort. My 5 year old is even able to make polka dots with them.  Plus, they are quite pretty! If you enjoy painting nails, these are a cheap, fun tool to have. Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> These are a great tool for my nailart needs, and a great price too! Very happy.</li>
    <li> This item was delivered fast! It is worth the price. I can&#x27;t believe I paid a lot more for another set in the nail supply stores in LA. This set comes with a small plastic holder to store the tools when not in use. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchased.</li>
    <li> If yu have a daughter who is into nails, this is a perfect stocking stuffer or bday extra.  They can crack if too much pressure is used.</li>
    <li> These items work great to make dots on your fingernails, and are tiny so you can carry them on the go :)</li>
    <li> I used these to paint the dots on my three year olds nails to make lady bugs. She loved it!</li>
    <li> It took awhile for them to get here but I got them today n am happy with my product. I can design my daughters nails now.</li>
    <li> These worked great for me! Every size that I would need for dotting tools and they seem sturdy and good quality!</li>
    <li> an all 5 dotting tools have diff sizes. I love the colors an everything. its easier to make charms :) thank you. I hope to do business with again sometime.</li>
    <li> Great for nail art, especially with some ideas gleaned from YouTube touts, BUT, also terrific for papercrafting embossing, as well as foil or craft sheet metal embossing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timely delivery, without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more likely to be a return customer or a trusted seller, than to try a new seller to save just a few cents.</li>
    <li> Love this dotting pen that I bought! It&#x27;s so easy to use, make patterns, copy some designs over the internet then boom.. Nail art hehe..</li>
    <li> I really love them! I use them every time I need to make dots! I use it with nail polish or acrylic paint on my nails! Thank you and recommended!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a variety of sizes in dotting tools and have found them! They are cute &amp; sturdy and well worth the $&lt;br /&gt;Very happy, will recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> This is a great little bunch of dotting tools for nails, and cheaper than buying in a local beauty supply store, where this identical set was being sold for 4X as much as I paid on Amazon!</li>
    <li> What can I say I love them! All came with different size tips.Took awhile to receive,but the product was great when it arrived no damage! Will order again!</li>
    <li> I gave the dotting tools 5 stars because they work great. I have not had any problems with them. They are also very easy to use and don&#x27;t take a lot of nail polish. You don&#x27;t have to be a professional to use these!! There are 10 different sizes. To me they work great!!</li>
    <li> Comes in varies sizes I&#x27;ve found them to be created beautifully no complaints here.</li>
    <li> I received these about 2 weeks early. Used them the first night and fell in love! They came in different sizes and very colorful. So excited!!</li>
    <li> I felt like it took long to get the delivery. They are small, but I like to use them just the same.</li>
    <li> These are great and rediculously affordable.  This is my second purchase of them, because I bought this bunch for a friend as a gift!</li>
    <li> great sibling present</li>
    <li> I ordered the multi-pastel set pictured above.  Instead I got a matching set in dark blue.  I suppose they will work the same, but they are a gift for my little granddaughters and they would have liked the pastels.  I will no longer purchase anything that is shipped from china because they never seem to send what was ordered.</li>
    <li> very cute and well made</li>
    <li> They work for the price however it would have been nice if they were a bit larger or had more size variety</li>
    <li> Nice, great for nail art! Smaller than expected, but that&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Love love love GREAT product PERFECT price</li>
    <li> These tools are great!! Easy to hold and eat to use...even my 6year-old could easily use them. I love them!</li>
    <li> These are great! They r cheap and they shipped okay and for here on time. They r very sturdy and I definitely recommend. Plus mine came with a free bracelet!</li>
    <li> So these nail art tools did take quite a long time to ship, but for the price they are well worth the wait. Not only are they cute different colors, but they come with lots of different sizes and seem to be very well made. I&#x27;m even more excited now to paint my nails.</li>
    <li> so much cheaper than going to the salon. love the different sizes. they are made of good quality and come in a handy case</li>
    <li> so i was extremely happy when i received these a week earlier than expected. i started doing nail art and found it extremely difficult to do it without the dotting tools but these are very useful. i love them so much i actually started using them right away ! if you wanna see what these babies can do follow me on instagram: ahah_ari</li>
    <li> I purchased the nail art tools as a gift for my neice and she likes it so much, I&#x27;ll be purchasing a set for myself.  They are easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Each pen has two ends, totaling 10 different sizes. I have always been inspired by nail art and this is perfect for me to use. They are easy to use and clean up well.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my daughter, but I borrow them all the time. These are great for nail art. As a set, you get several different sizes, which allows you to create uniform circles in many different sizes.</li>
    <li> I love this set perfect sizes! cute colors! would order more.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle easy to use, even with hands full or busy these work great~</li>
    <li> These dotters are great!!! Only thing is you have to be careful that you dont lose the metal tips. They will fall out. That has been my only problem so far. :)</li>
    <li> Cheap and effective, what more can you want!</li>
    <li> I purchased (4) sets of these pens as gifts. They look nice and came as described. I only received (3) of the (4) so far but I&#x27;ve contacted the owners and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll send me the last set. I&#x27;ll update if this isn&#x27;t the case but they sure do look as described to me and I would buy them!&lt;br /&gt;March 29, 2014 UPDATE - Received package in mail today. Supplier sent me and incomplete order. I wrote to them today and requested them to send what I ordered/paid for. I understand there probably is a language barrier but I bought these as gifts and need to use them soon. I asked them to send the remaining item ASAP but somehow I am loosing faith in if they understand what this means. I also attached a picture of what I ordered. Will update again once I received contact.&lt;br /&gt;LAST UPDATE- April 17, 2014 - Today I received the last set of pens. It took a few emails but the seller always answered my emails and did promise to ship the missing set air mail (which the seller did, the package has stamps all over it). The product was just like the other ones and I can now complete my gift sets I need for May. THANK YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the seller- they keep there word. I won&#x27;t lie - there is a communication problem but the seller always responded positively and kept there word.</li>
    <li> These work amazing they came in so fast did I mention they work AMAZING they are all different sizes so happy with them</li>
    <li> These dotting pens have worked as promised and I would recommend them for any use.  They are a good quality and weight for salon or home use.</li>
    <li> I do my nails a lot! I have found that the dotting tools have been a great addition to my nail polish collection. Like I said I am in love with them</li>
    <li> I really like the dotting pens ! The variety in sizes  is very helpful! I also like the fun colors and wavy design!</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat these!  They arrived fairly quickly, and we use them all the time to decorate our nails.  I&#x27;m really glad I bought these.</li>
    <li> never arived this is a bunch of crap</li>
    <li> Lovely and useful set. I will also use them with paper embossing</li>
    <li> These are exactly as described. Very fun and colorful and they do just what they are described to do. Overall, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great tools to use for nail art , easy to clean. I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for dotting tools to use in nail art.</li>
    <li> I actually bought these for face painting. They&#x27;re perfect for doing little dots with my water activated mehron paints! I would highly recommend them for this purpose. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet for my nails but I&#x27;m sure they do just as good of a job. My only tip is to make sure you don&#x27;t have to much product on your dotting tool.</li>
    <li> i received these very quick. love them used them already, still no problems with it except maybe the smaller balls almost look the same size but its ok got a good variety and they are super cute they work great at making the dots i need on my nail when i do nail art.</li>
    <li> received really fast. work great</li>
    <li> It was delivered quicker than I expected. It looked just like the picture. You can&#x27;t beat a price like this for nail art tools!</li>
    <li> these dotting tools were just what I was looking for, multiple sizes and that was great. ok price as well.</li>
    <li> I bought these for Christmas gifts, haven&#x27;t used but I think for younger and older adults they will give that finished look when painting your nails at home I hope with all the different pieces that they will give a look of a professional doing the nails</li>
    <li> Fun to use for an at home manicure. I like to have pedicured toes with out having to spend the $. These help make cute designs. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing tools... perfect for lovely decorations. Completely satisfied my expectations. Will totally recommend to relatives and friends. Perfect price as well..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to paint a perfect dot even with these tools.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> They said the package would be here from November 28-December17, a week later, still haven&#x27;t gotten it. The &amp;#34;tracking&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;d suggest finding somewhere else to purchase dotters.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re so cute. Love em. They work awesome! Does the job and looks great in my kit. Super nice.  : )</li>
    <li> Thank you for my pens! I am happy with what I got! I love that your price is cheap. And since this is my first time buying a dotting tool I didn&#x27;t want to be disappointed with what I got if  I paid alot! So thumbs up to you! They came in perfect condition! I also got them about a week early!! I ordered them sometime in late July and got them August 14th!! They were supposed to be here the 21st or in September..:) So I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve done business with you!! I totally recommend this place to you all!! Thanks ! Have a great day!&lt;br /&gt;  ~Lillian</li>
    <li> I got these and was soooo happy however when I went to use them for the forst time the metl piece came out of the stick...bummer, good thing I am resourceful and had some super glue on hand, I fixed it and they are now perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite difficult trying to dot my nails with it because it doesn&#x27;t come out the way I would like it to be.</li>
    <li> Good product to have, easy to use!</li>
    <li> I was out shopping with my mom the other day and she mentioned wanting a nail dotting set. We found a set at our local beauty supply store and she almost bought them before I stopped her - &amp;#34;let me check online first&amp;#34;. Of course I found them for cheaper so I ordered her a set. I received them two days later and just in the nick of time (my mom and I had got together again for lunch and she was about to go home). She wasn&#x27;t expecting them so soon yet she was excited to test them out. Within a few hours, I received a test from my mom with a pic of her toes, she had used the dotting tools to paint polka dots on her red nails. They came out great! I&#x27;ll be ordering a set for myself now.</li>
    <li> They were great!! I love them..I got them a lot faster than what I was told..I enjoy them..</li>
    <li> Have not gotten them.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered before Thanksgiving.&lt;br /&gt;Would love to know when this might arrive&lt;br /&gt;to my house. ??? ???</li>
    <li> They work great and they were inexpensive! Now I have Super cute polka dot nails! My friends thought I got them done!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools work great. I&#x27;ve seen these same products on the market for $20 or $30. They aren&#x27;t too big to hold, and each of the ends have a different size dotter. The dried nail polish easily comes off with remover.</li>
    <li> I love them they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> All were different sizes (not all were the same size like the other reviews), very handy for nail art, i used it after receiving it and it works great and now i can do all sorst of nail designs! I love it, and it&#x27;s AFFORDABLE!</li>
    <li> Not much to say except they do exactly what they are supposed to and seem well made. Over all, very pleased!</li>
    <li> As described.  Great for picking up tiny nail charms (I get the tip wet then pick it up) and making designs.</li>
    <li> I got them really fast and they were all different size. Read the review before and that I was going to get all the same size but I didnt</li>
    <li> Product is great. Exactly what is shown and detailed.  Keep in mind if you want this in a hurry do not get it from here, product is coming from Hong Kong. But the quality is awesome.</li>
    <li> Found it was good for nails and other art products.  Thats all I have to say about that.  Thats all I have to say about that.</li>
    <li> these work great and they are a good price. just what I wanted every size tip and I like that they are double sided, easy to hold and have a nice little bag that they come in as well!</li>
    <li> i love these so much they come in so handy with doing nail designs i am able to do soooo many things and they help me to pick up gems and crystals</li>
    <li> Cute and good for price.</li>
    <li> These nail tools are great!!! For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it and can create all kinds of cool nail designs on your own!</li>
    <li> The pens came and are just what I ordered. They are good quality and work well. They took a few weeks to come but it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It took a while to come from oversees. It is my favorite so far. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> These definitely make the dots perfect on your nails without a doubt!  Easy to work with and the selection of size is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of fun with these tools.  I use them for egg painting, nail polish design and other craft products.</li>
    <li> I bought these while trying to build my own personal acrylic nail set. They arrived quickly, and to my dismay, one of the  points began to fall out of the handle. A small disappointment that I was able to correct myself with some super glue. Otherwise, they work fantastic and are super cute. My daughters all love when I use these to decorate their nails.</li>
    <li> They were in perfect shape, and worked excellent. Was excellent! So good, for such a cheap price. Highly recommended for beginners!</li>
    <li> Cheapest you will find.! There are so many others out there that spend well over 10$ for theirs but why? Buy it here I just got mine like 2 weekend ago and I&#x27;m In love probably one of my favorites.!</li>
    <li> Bought these cause they were really cheapand i thought id use them but i really havent, they sit in the bathroom cabinet cause honestly i dont know how to use them to make designs that are cool. all i get off them is dots. so eh, could have gone with out buying them.</li>
    <li> This pen srt is all that I hoped it would be.  Easy to use and provides various size dots for nail art.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It did not come late, and all the sizes were as shown. Can finally give my rubber ducky nails bubbles now:)Great purchase.</li>
    <li> These are actually very well made dotting tools.  I use them for everything.  My fingernails and all of my art projects.  They are very tough too.  I use them to pry things also.  Small things.  They are really great.</li>
    <li> Great sizes but some are the same.</li>
    <li> This item is awesome it works so good and does perfect dots and all different sizes I love it :)</li>
    <li> These dotting pens are double sided, and each one has different sizes of dotting heads. perfect for making lines that aren&#x27;t too thick, and perfect for multi sized polka dot nails. I also use these when I want to draw on my nails, such as breast cancer ribbons or hearts, etc. Perfect. I love these.</li>
    <li> this is the best invested dollar and fifty cents i have ever spent a must for nail art so good I got 2 one for my mom</li>
    <li> Love these dotting tools!  I would recommend them to anyone.  They arrived much sooner than expected and I wish I would have ordered more to give as gifts!!  Love, love, LOVE!</li>
    <li> The product is cool- works great. A total of 10 different sized tips. The price was beyond low and shipping was free and LIGHTNING fast!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. The metal part did come out of the plastic part but it was pretty easy to put back in and super glue.</li>
    <li> very happy ,easy to make all kinds of designs .others have borrowed them from me . Then purchased there own from this dealer.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these tools. They arrived before the scheduled delivery date and I am very pleased about that. I have inspected them carefully. None of them were bent or broken upon receiving them and I did notice that the sizes of the dotting ends are different, though they may not appear that way at first glance. I am very excited about using them and very happy about the purchase. It was money well spent.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for nail tools that can enhance your creativity with polish on your nails, these are the ones to order. There are a variety of points/sizes for adding an &amp;#34;artsy&amp;#34; touch. You can make super simple designs to complex.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Metal tip fell off on 2 but you get what you pay for and they get the job done</li>
    <li> Everyone loves this creative, easy to use item.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I have used them mannnyyy times already!!</li>
    <li> Makes it easier to do designs on your nails and toes.  Awesome.  I would recommend this to a friend.  In fact I have already</li>
    <li> Took a little while to get here but I used it works well with designs like polka dot cheetah or flowers etc</li>
    <li> These objects served me well in all of my nail art needs.  There are some repeated sizes of the dots but for the price, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested in nail art.</li>
    <li> I love these! They seem very durable and have a variety of sizes. You absolutely cannot beat the price for all of these either. I&#x27;ve recently started some DIY nail art with gel polish and wanted to try some dotting tools without making a large investment. These are worth every penny! My only complaint was it took a very long time to get here from China, so if you need these ASAP, you&#x27;ll need to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great for nail art! Got them quickly in mail.</li>
    <li> I am a current beauty school student, which means I am on a tight budget. Finding good tools for a price I can afford is something that can be a struggle. That being said, I am SO glad I purchased these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have a variety of tip sizes to help with all your nail detailing needs! They also are just as sturdy as the ones I could have bought at the Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply in my town!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> love the colors for this item. i use them quite a bit and i love that they were very affordable</li>
    <li> I wish that the different tips had markings to show what the size is. I feel like my subjective view of them is sometimes confusing, like sometimes I can&#x27;t tell which is bigger.</li>
    <li> Love these! They are sturdy and worth the price. You can create lots of designs with these dotting pens. SATISFIED!</li>
    <li> They were much smaller than I thought they would be. About the length of a disposable razor rather than a pencil, but they are easy to use and do what they are supposed to which is make dots. I&#x27;m glad I bought these as they make nail art less of a hassle.</li>
    <li> These are great tools. They look good and work good. They come in a nice variety of sizes. They are also pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> one of them came with a little bit of a crack in it and if you drop one it can break</li>
    <li> I do nails for a living.&lt;br /&gt;These make designs so easy to do and fun.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely glad I bought them :)</li>
    <li> This product definitely came from overseas because when it came I couldn&#x27;t read the print on the envelope. It also toke forever to get here. The dotters are kind of cheap, but for the money, they do want you want them to do. Make designs. Hope this is helpful!</li>
    <li> Pretty good but DO NOT put the thing in nail polish remover, the ball will slip right out of the socket.</li>
    <li> Very good quality for a great price and they came quick!</li>
    <li> They work just fine. I just need more practice.</li>
    <li> Great deal for dotting tools.  Standard tools eight various size tips.</li>
    <li> Exactly as listed. They&#x27;re a little on the small side. Like a few Inches tops, not as long as a regular nail art pen or pencil would be, but they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
    <li> I did get was in the picture but on the other end its all the same size but it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
    <li> But am not a professional so I really can&#x27;t enjoy painting my nails as I wanted to. But other then that is a handy tool.</li>
    <li> I love these! they are exactly what I wanted, I got them way before the estimated delivery date and it was a great value. I only paid $1.67 and they sent me a dollar back with my order. So I got these super cute sturdy nail tools for only .67!</li>
    <li> very useful but took a long time to arrive</li>
    <li> They are really tiny so that&#x27;s cool. I use them for polymer clay projects and let my little sister use them for nail art.</li>
    <li> The dotting tools make my life a lot easier, they made nail art fun and I love them!&lt;br /&gt;PROS; Help me do nail art , come in different sizes, easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;CONS; I waited FOREVER  for these dotting tools it was like 2 months! and after I got them I ended up using them only a couple of times :\ but I try to use them every time I do my nails, But they are great and I recommend 100% !</li>
    <li> Although one of the Dotting tool is missing a side (so instead if 10 different size dots I got 9) its still a great product and I love it. I use it with most if not all my nail art designs. How can I miss what I never had is how I view my experience.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what the Granddaughter wanted.  Great Product !</li>
    <li> Awesome deal!!!!!!!! I bought these to use with clay and they work great. I use them in the design process and for painting too. Highly Recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> These do what they claim to do and they do it well.  I can&#x27;t think of one negative thing to say about them.  And they&#x27;re cute too.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my fiancé and she uses them all the time. They work pretty great for the price. She has already made her friends get some.</li>
    <li> Item is as pictured but it seems 3 of the ends were the same size....I also wished there was an end for large dots. But overall its ok.</li>
    <li> These came exactly as pictured. 5 double ended dotting tools, so 10 different sized dotters. It could be that there are a couple that are the same size, but honestly, who cares? It means I can use different ones for different colors without dealing with clean up in the middle of my work. For a dollar &amp; change, there&#x27;s no way I can give these anything less than 5 stars. They arrived within a couple of weeks, in a padded envelope, in a nice little pouch. They cleanup easily with acetone and work just great.</li>
    <li> very inexpensive way to decorate your own nails!  Fun, very easy to use and tons of different designs - great product!</li>
    <li> I started doing my own nails a few months ago. The dotters were just an added bonus to my nail collections. Now I do my sisters&#x27; nails and they look professional without being so hard</li>
    <li> I already did a review on this. No other comment, No Comment Come on people  I dont  understand it because did not receive instructions with it.</li>
    <li> I got these for my Granddaughter. This are great to make tiny tiny dots on her fingernails. She loves them.</li>
    <li> Works for making nail designs. Plus side - price is very good and the product works. Down side - takes FOREVER to arrive in the US.</li>
    <li> I like these dotting tools alot  even though a piece broke off the pink one. I just glued it back on, other than that they work quite well</li>
    <li> I use them for craft projects and painting on scrap pages and note cards.  The tips have all different sizes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them for nails and for other painting things and they work great! They&#x27;re colorful and not plain and double sided so you get 10 sizes of dots!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for painting little bunnies or other designs on your nails.  It can also be used for painting details on craft projects as well, they are easy to clean with a cotton ball and some nail polish remover.  They are also thick and sturdy and don&#x27;t feel like they will break when you use them, they are so affordable I highly recommend getting these!</li>
    <li> I love nail art, and these help a lot, so easy to use and I got them early which it&#x27;s great, the colors are cute.</li>
    <li> I like doing my own nails and decided to order these dotting tools. They came in fast, and I adore them. They are cute and work great, plus you can&#x27;t beat the price. If your starting to get into nail art -go ahead and buy them.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I pictured, but work great.</li>
    <li> One end of each tool has the same small sized dotting ball, in case you were thinking there were ten different sizes. But really there are only so many sizes you could use on your nails and 5 is definitely enough for me. They are cute and the handles seem sturdy but one of the tips fell right out of the handle! I honestly don&#x27;t care since they were super cheap so I&#x27;ll just glue it back in.</li>
    <li> Arrived 2 weeks earlier than estimated! Perfect and cute. Great price. I have no experience using this,  but for my experimenting at home,  it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> i have been looking for these everywhere and then i found them here an was so excited. They work so well and are definetly worth buying.</li>
    <li> They were a little smaller than I thought, but nonetheless they do their job :) I would definitely recommend these to others. On top of the great quality, they shipped faster than date expected.</li>
    <li> I love these dotters!  They come in a good variety of sized and make nail art so much more fun as it opens up windows to designs I couldn&#x27;t do before.</li>
    <li> Came in all different sizes which I was worried about because of other reviews but I love them.  Great job!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these! I got these extremely cheap and free shipping. They were literally less than $2 total. They have a nice size range. The only problem is that when I got them. One of the ends fell out but I glued it back on. It&#x27;s fine now. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend these to anyone who want nice quality cheap dotting tools. LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> The dotting tools work really well except the bottom half of the dotting tools are all the same side. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> love my new dotting pens.  they arrived on time and are as described, now i can do more nail art since I have the dotting pens...no issues with them breaking yet like others have said</li>
    <li> Received these today. They came in two days earlier than the estimated arrival which is absolutely fine by me! Nice and sturdy, they have a good feel to them. Haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look to be in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product and that it came just on time and I love it, it looks just like in the picture! It&#x27;s a great product!! I love it!</li>
    <li> Loved these they came right on time,they are plastic with metal dotters but for the price totally worth it,they work great and are easy to use!</li>
    <li> I am new at this not even licensed but love doing nails i experiment with my nail all the time so happy i got this product for my nails and always have a perfect dot .</li>
    <li> It was so inexpensive!  No issues with breakage for any of them.  I use them for working with cold porcelain clay and it is perfect!  I don&#x27;t use it for nails.</li>
    <li> I Just Got These Pens They Arrived Fast And In Great Condition!. And They Are Super Cute!. I Would So Recommend People To Buy From This Seller!. They Are Nice And Small So They Wont Take Up To Much Space!. I Can&#x27;t Wait To Try Them Out!. :)</li>
    <li> Shipping took long, but that&#x27;s expected. I actually forgot about this and was very pleasantly surprised when it came! I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but from the look and feel they are good quality and very cute.</li>
    <li> Awesome product at a fantastic price! Tips are smooth and perfectly round. Come in a plastic bag that you can use again.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that instead of shipping me 5 pieces as advertised they are shipping only 2 pieces and still charged the same price they charge for the 5 piece set. When I receive product I may change my rating. But it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m going to change my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;After waiting and wondering I did finally receive my items (before the deadline, thankfully,  but they did give themselves alot of time) I did receive 5 pieces,  wonderful pieces! They are perfect. Packaging was secure. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These turned out great! The only downfall is on a few of the tools the dotting tool came out very easily, but all I did was put super glue on it and in 30 seconds it was like new! Very easy to use and clean!</li>
    <li> I was watching beginner nail art videos on YouTube, and she used these. I just ordered them last night, but I cannot wait until they get here!</li>
    <li> I seriously don&#x27;t tnk ill ever need this many sizes but if I do I have them. And they work great!</li>
    <li> This took a while to get but it was a lot cheaper than at the store so for the savings it was worth the wait.  It has a pretty design and pretty colors.  I like having the different colors because when the granddaughters are all together they know tool by the color.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> There are five tools, but each has a different head and makes different dots! I got them for like two bucks, free shipping. Kinda took forever, but I knew it would. Like almost a month, but I knew it would take that long before I bought it, which was fine by me because it was free shipping and from a reliable seller. The seller told me it would take that long. You can avoid that by ordering from a different seller. I love these things! Ever since I got them, I&#x27;ve changed my nails like every day and done a new design using them. They vary in size and I just go to town every time I use them. I would buy them again, that&#x27;s how much I love them and how much I use them! An absolute must have for me and if you&#x27;re looking for a way to spice up doing your nails I would start off with buying a set of these. I just clean them off with some nail polish remover and then soap and water and I&#x27;m good to go. I dab a little of the nail polish I want, and it doesn&#x27;t matter which nail polish I use (thick or thin, opaque or shimmer) on something plastic and use the dotters. Then I clean everything off with nail polish remover. Easy to use! Amazing tools!</li>
    <li> These are really nice to have around for doing your nail or painting on canvas. They don&#x27;t work with all polish but it&#x27;s trial &amp; error.</li>
    <li> love the price, love the dotting tools...looked for them everywhere only found one and it was very small, love that they had different sizes</li>
    <li> I love it!!!, the tool are so little and easy to use, also the colours are so pretty!!!&lt;br /&gt;The package came fast, no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;Im very very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> Got two sets of these. I love them a lot. Perfect for a beginner in nail art like me.</li>
    <li> the colors are cute, i dont use most of them, but the one i use a lot was worth buying the set for.</li>
    <li> it gets the job done and at a good price! its a good size for me too i like it</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Great Price.  i am very excited to use these.  Sturdy construction.  I highly recommend this product. Item as pictured.</li>
    <li> I think I paid $3 for this product. It basically has 10 tools (5 tools with each side different). Its perfect for making little flowers or other nail designs and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> be patient it takes time to get but it is what it is described &amp; reasonably priced what a bargain</li>
    <li> The biggest one is not I want one ,need bigger.</li>
    <li> Good dotting tools for the price, the little nibs end up falling out of the handle with ease.  Just drop a little nail glue down into the hole and stick the metal end back to fix.</li>
    <li> First off, as others have mentioned the delivery is quite a bit longer than usual but considering how far they have to travel it really wasn&#x27;t nearly as long as I would have expected. Moving on to the actual dotting pens - they are Adorable, and so easy to use/clean. Personally, I have never found a comparison for the price in any other store. If you don&#x27;t mind waiting a little bit then I definitely recommend this set for anyone.</li>
    <li> Worked well. I only wish they had bigger dots. Most of them are very small. That is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> havent tried using the tools but it came a week earlier than the expected date and it is as similar as what it looks like in the picture.adorable tool and i will use it very soon </li>
    <li> Good set for the nail kit, some of the tips are the same size not 10 different sizes, will do the job and work well</li>
    <li> When i ordered this for my daughter, i didn&#x27;t expect it to be that amazing. She made the most beautiful designs with it and i cant even explain the look on my nail salon&#x27;s face when they heard/ saw her nails that she did her self. in fact the nail salon manager asked if she went to another nail salon and when we told her no she didn&#x27;t believe us, so we had to clean her nails and show the manager how she did her nails.</li>
    <li> It took over a month to get these, and when they arrive, they aren&#x27;t even the right sizes! I got like 2 of each 5 different sizes. A big one was not included. SOOOOOO ANGRY! Might have been good if I actually got what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I love these! The price is fantastic and the quality of the product is amazing as well. I bought one for myself and another for my aunt. They are slightly fragile. I believe I sat them on my desk too hard one time and 1 of the ends on 2 of the tools is shattered but still together and usable. Another end on 1 broke completely off but it was nothing too major that glue couldn&#x27;t fix. Still worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought two sets of these and I really needed them a little sooner, but I got them which was good. ^_^ They are in great quality and are very useful for nail art or clay working. 4 stars because I waited quite a bit!</li>
    <li> One was loose, but I glued it back in after it fell out, now it works just fine. Packaging wasn&#x27;t great but can&#x27;t complain they all got here before expected.</li>
    <li> Havnt used this item yet need some gel nail poish but looking forward all of my items that I have used I am very pleased and I really enjoy everything that I have gotten .I used them its not like something I bought and just threw in a closet theses items are so fun and the results well I dont think they could get any better im am very well pleased with al my products</li>
    <li> love them!!!! Still learning how to use them but they work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I love these pens there so easy to use and really good quality i don&#x27;t have to use toothpicks any more💅🏻They even come with a marbling tip!!!!!!😛😛😛That do come with five pens but I&#x27;ve had these for a long times so I lost the other one😕</li>
    <li> Came early, exactly what I ordered, and I love them. I thought most of the tips were the same size, but they are different shapes. It creates a different size. It is great an I love them a lot! MUST HAVE MORE POLKA DOTS!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! They are really handy and I love the marble effect! It&#x27;s really easy to clean. Great product!😊</li>
    <li> I like it and design for nail...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cincinnati, Ohio</li>
    <li> They are great good quality exactly what I was expecting I&#x27;m happy with what I got thumps up for this one !</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get these. I had been using the tip of a colored pencil, or the end of a thin paintbrush to do my dots before. This is much easier! The designs are cute. The size of each end varies, but all of them have the same size dot on the other end. I figured these would probably be cheaply made, but so far they&#x27;ve held up great and look well put together. &amp; the little pouch it comes in makes it easy to store and carry. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this item for beginner and advanced alike.</li>
    <li> It works and I have no prob w/ it so far</li>
    <li> These are great, and so much more affordable than the one in a beauty store. Each stick has two size dots on it, but one end is the same size on each stick, so you get 6 different size dots instead of 10. Seems like a waste, but it still serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> i love doing designs on my nails. love how there are many different sizes u can do dots i can do my daughters nails now. came from Hong Kong</li>
    <li> This item is very good for putting small, perfect dots on your nails. Whether you&#x27;re just making polka dots or trying to make a flower, this is a very good tool.</li>
    <li> Love them. Great to have many sizes</li>
    <li> WoW Excellent~~ Thank You so much! A++++-+</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but very excited to do so! Like other reviews say, they come in 5-6 different sizes but they are double sided. And one side has all the same size on all 5.</li>
    <li> My sister ordered this same set, and it came within a couple months.  I tried the pens out and liked them a lot and decided to order some for myself.  It has been 3 months and I have not yet received my dotting pens.  I contacted the seller regarding my order status 3 weeks ago and have not heard back.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve ended up having to file a claim via Amazon.  I guess it&#x27;s hit or miss with this seller.  My sister received hers just fine, so if you order from this seller I suggest you proceed with caution.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these. So helpful when doing nails</li>
    <li> They brake easily and it&#x27;s hard to so basic techniques . I would not sujesy buying this product at all .</li>
    <li> Great for what it&#x27;s intended. They make nail art a breeze, which is refreshing when you&#x27;re first starting to do your own nails.</li>
    <li> I loved this product it came in a day early than what i expected&lt;br /&gt;The dotting tool itself is perfect but the packaging is just a cherry on top !&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Really cute and shipped in one week exactly! I just wished that the pictures showed the dotting tools EXACTLY how they sent it. They are only 5 different sizes but to be honest, I dont really need 10 different ones! Loved them and really recommend buying!</li>
    <li> I love doing peoples nails so I was so excited to get these. They come in different sizes to make different designs I use them all the time. Sturdy and awesome tools!</li>
    <li> They arrived safely and were as described</li>
    <li> I like the price and quality of this product. Took a month to get here but I really like them. Easy to use,</li>
    <li> i love these! so helpful with nail art. one thing i will say is i wish there was a really tiny dotting tool.</li>
    <li> I bought these because a friend recommended after I had used hers. These are much thinner than the ones I used, so getting acquainted with them will take a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did enjoy the different sizes of the balls on both sides, though I do think some of the sizes repeat themselves. However I am still content with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I just recieved the dotting tools after more than a month of waiting. The colors aren&#x27;t the same in person as in the photo. And the dot sizes seem to only increase size by a really small amount. But it was very cheap so I guess it&#x27;s sorta worth it, but it took so long to some</li>
    <li> These dotting tools work soo good! Well made considering the price, they make great sized dots! all different sizes, lots of variations. They are also very easy to clean. If you clean it right after your done using it them you can just wipe it off with a napkin! And it still comes out just as clean. Make great party bag fillers</li>
    <li> I really like these nail dotting tools.  It is a great range of sizes for any job.  I love that they are dual ended.  Great purchase at a nice price!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Everything came nicely packaged and in great condition. Definetly worth the wait. I would recommend this product to everyone. ❤️LOVE IT❤️</li>
    <li> I ordered these to try new things with my nails, I have yet to try them, but i am very excited to do so.</li>
    <li> these are perfect to make lines or dots. and i love how there are different sizes so you have a wide range of design that you can do</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and they were a GREAT price</li>
    <li> Great price, and even better communication with the seller. The product was exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these to make cool patterns on her fingernails. They arrived fairly quickly, and were really inexpensive. They are fairly solid little tools.</li>
    <li> They seemed to work great at first but then two of them broke. The plastic that holds the metal piece on just fell to pieces one day while using it.</li>
    <li> Love them even though some are the same size I still love them..&lt;br /&gt;They r great for nails art and more</li>
    <li> All the sizes are perfect for all my nail art designs, they colors and nice and eye catching, I would defiantly refer these anyone looking into purchasing them.</li>
    <li> it took a while to come, but when it did i was extremely happy. it works perfectly and i like the colors. its easy to clean (a napkin and nail polish remover) and after being played with by my 3 little siblings it did not break</li>
    <li> Great, on time, item arrived in perfect condition my kid loved it too, Thanks for a great online purchasing experience.&lt;br /&gt;If I need a similar item, will purchase from &amp;#34;Uniqstore&amp;#34; again.</li>
    <li> This are perfect for scoring.  Much better than using a bone folder like the one that comes with the Martha Stewart scorboard.  Five stars for a good product and for speedier delivery than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting for. 10 different sizes of dots n made with a very goid material. It&#x27;s working great!!</li>
    <li> They work well but I didn&#x27;t get a variety of sizes</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter&#x27;s 13th birthday goody bags.  All the girls loved them.  Very reasonably priced. Got 6 of them. If looking for things to put in a spa bag these are nice!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this purchase, but they work really well and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I wish I had ordered more.</li>
    <li> Very good I recommend</li>
    <li> These came sooner than expected. They are pretty and I think I got my money&#x27;s worth considering because it comes with five pencils</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect these nail art tools to be as good as they are considering the low cost. They work great and the acrylic design is very pretty too!</li>
    <li> I love it! They are easy to use and worth the price. I ordered 3 more for my family members for their stocking.</li>
    <li> arrived on time undamaged .i have used it at lest 7x and they still work.i feel like there are around 7or 8 diffrienent tip sizes .some look the same however if you look closely you can see the slightly chage size witch makes them seem like they are the  same size</li>
    <li> Can not imagine all of the compliments I got on my nails by just doing poka dot looks. It gives you something new and is very cute.</li>
    <li> these are great for any design  you can imagine. very durable and a price  you cant beat. will definitely be ordering again</li>
    <li> Perfect especially being a beginner nail artist.....Love these tools &amp; Very Pretty and Colorful Will definitely order again in the future</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and for the price can not be beat! It took a long time to get them, but I have used them a lot and they are very well constructed and cute.</li>
    <li> The day I pulled these dotting tools out of the package, my white one was missing a whole silver dotting portion so there is nothing but a cavity on that end. Would have been 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t missing.&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note the balls on the end have not came off which is great!</li>
    <li> Does what I need it for. I like it. The only hold up is when u dot it makes it big or little is like not a small dot u can&#x27;t even see it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that they were not all different sizes,  That said, the tips are nice and smooth and they do the job they were designed for.  The colors are pretty.  They are lightweight so some care must be taken not to damage them.</li>
    <li> This was a good buy it was worth it so I gave it 4 stars</li>
    <li> Works just as expected.</li>
    <li> I use these for blending clay work lovely for the price. Also use them as nail dotters sometimes super easy.</li>
    <li> Some of them were the same size . I thought they would all be different.  And there also pretty small</li>
    <li> These tools were just as good as the other ones I ordered. They work well with whatever you decide to use them for. I used them for Clay Charms and they worked perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail art kit to do fun nail designs with my 9 year old daughter. We enjoy this set.</li>
    <li> These doting tools were received in good condition and are of good quality. They are comparable to more expensive versions. I would definitely recommend (even though shipping takes a while).</li>
    <li> Great dotting tools um not as bright as the picture though but works great &amp; cute! Love it! You should get it</li>
    <li> Versatile, cute, and just as good as the expensive styles. Terrific bargain -- I got 5 double-ended nail dotters for less than the average price of 1! :)</li>
    <li> Ohk only thing I loved was that it didnt take long to get here and that the product is as shown in picture only problem was that the other 5 dotting tools on the other side are exactly the same sadly</li>
    <li> Happy with the purchase!!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome dotting tools they are fantastic! I adore them!! They work great for all kinds of dotting decorations :)</li>
    <li> Love these! Work perfectly! Great Price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for an art project -- not to do my nails.  It took a long time to arrive but it works well and the range of tip-sizes allows the user to make a wide range of repeatable dot-sizes</li>
    <li> Some of them fell apart. I Had to glue them back on. I suppose For the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for use with my polymer clay designs. They work great, are easy to use and I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> They do exactly what they intend to do.... make dots or what ever other designs you wish to make. Nice and sturdy product. I like!</li>
    <li> Bought for my granddaughter for Christmas and she said she loves them. They are tools used to make dots and designs on fingernail. This does not have color in it but is used for application of dots and designs.</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools. They were a great price and are a great quality, work perfectly for the intended use.</li>
    <li> I received exactly what it said I would get and I absolutely love them! a must have for all nail art fanatics(:</li>
    <li> So much fun for our girls to use to decorate nails till their brains are tired!  The different sizes allow for a variety of ideas.</li>
    <li> More than a month to come after bought, when it came it they were good, very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> My sissy loves these,I bought them for her &amp; she loves them,she was happy that I bought these for her.</li>
    <li> Slow to arrive (as expected) but exceeded my daughter&#x27;s expectations. I didn&#x27;t expect much for that price. Amazed they could make and deliver them so cheaply directly from China.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails so these dotting tools are one of the best things I can ask for especially when I&#x27;m bored</li>
    <li> The five piece dotting tools are really useful not only for nail art but also for clay making. They are also really sturdy and have multiple uses.</li>
    <li> Love this purchase. Nail art has become a hobby. Very happy with my purchase. Will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> Love it so much recommend to everyone who want to buy it. Cheap but does the work perfect it&#x27;s so cool.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Love all the different sizes great for different designs great for rhe price. So glad with this product really suggest people get these.</li>
    <li> When I got them they were all wrecked up! There were chips missing and one didn&#x27;t have a peg on it. Other than that it was good to use.</li>
    <li> Took forever to ship but once it arrived a month after I ordered it, it came in handy while creating cute designs on my nails. Pretty easy to use after you practice a little.</li>
    <li> The first time I went to use these, the ends fell off. I glued the back in and they work fine now,but it stinks that they fell off the first time.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is they don’t fit in a bottle of nail polish, so I had to get the polish on it from the brush.  They do look pretty and have a good selection on tip sizes.</li>
    <li> i have been Waiting for four months...  i think thats very stupid... i Never put a negitive comment unless i need to</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! THANK YOU! it can on time and looked like it did as advertised. im very happy with my purchase! I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Order came on time. No problems on this item. Just as I expected. Perfect for nail art or other types of art projects.</li>
    <li> Works great and helps to make really cute designs I love it. It&#x27;s recommended to anyone any time ... it&#x27;s just wonderful</li>
    <li> Great for picking up the sparkle gems and moving them on the nail. The ball shape tip is the secret. It doesn&#x27;t stick to the stone.  I don&#x27;t know why the title says painting brush pen. Maybe the tip could be used to draw with nail polish; I didn&#x27;t try that yet.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive and they do a great job! Wish there was more variation of dot sizes but overall happy with my purchase. Espcially when I saw this same exact set at a beauty supply store for a lot more. So glad I ordered via Amazon. Great product!</li>
    <li> I got this for my friend for Christmas, she loved it!! and the design is very trippy! we both couldn&#x27;t stop looking at them.</li>
    <li> Can be used for dot designs, but also can be used to pick up sparkles to place onto nails by slightly moistening the tip.  Great for thr price.</li>
    <li> I saw the EXACT same set at sally&#x27;s beauty supply for $10. These work perfectly for what I needed them for.</li>
    <li> overall, I loved the varying sizes for designing. they are easy to clean off and have been very useful in making my nail art come to life. I would have loved for the set to come with finer points. I only ordered one set but for some reason received two.</li>
    <li> A little bit of the plastic broke off of one but with the help of some super glue it was no biggie. Other than that these are great and you can&#x27;t beat the price (seen them go for around $9 in stores).</li>
    <li> When received one didn&#x27;t have a tip on the end. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be various sizes either but still excited to try them. For the price I&#x27;m just glad they arrived.</li>
    <li> These took a little bit to ship but they are coming from china so it&#x27;s to be expected they are really good quality and a great price so excited to do nail designs with these now I&#x27;m planning in getting a nailpolish rack</li>
    <li> I have gotten them today and they were 2 weeks early but you only get 5 different sizes not 10. So I&#x27;m a little disappointed about that but other wise happy</li>
    <li> These do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to and are insanely cheap.  They look sturdy too and I like that they&#x27;re different colors.  Don&#x27;t pay more for a fancy dotting kit.  This is all you need.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! Was not expecting this good of quality for the price but WOW. Use them almost every day they work great for all nail art and has a ton of different sizes. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> it barely gets the product on the tip and messes up the rest of your nail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will not buy anymore of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Great idem to use with your nails!!!! They brake tho so don&#x27;t snap in half. You would have to slam it on the floor to brake it tho</li>
    <li> I use them all the time. They are still intact. Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Worked amazing. Beautiful. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for these items to arrive. The items look nice but one of the tips got broken. Anyhow I couldn&#x27;t complain much for the price.</li>
    <li> Absolute must have if you are doing nail designs.  The amount of detail you can get with the smallest tip is amazing.  These are so fun to play with to try new designs and they are essential for making easy flowers.</li>
    <li> These were exactly as shown in the picture and came very quick. They work very well I have used them many times already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m excited to decorate, this will be my first set of dotting tools and they have multiple sizes in one adorable set. Good-buy!</li>
    <li> I love them . I got exactly what I paided for</li>
    <li> Got them as Xmas gifts all the girls loved them</li>
    <li> THEYRE REALLY GOOD! They smell like plastic but they good so get them lol</li>
    <li> Great for working with clay</li>
    <li> Great Product! Using this for polymer clay and it is perfect! Fast delivery, arrived before estimated date. Not to mention the great price! Definetly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools, I am able to use them for various designs I want to achieve on my nails. They are easy to clean too. I recommend them!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, the only thing bad is both sides are the same size I thought the ends would be bigger.</li>
    <li> perfect me an my 4 daughters have spa parties an they love them.</li>
    <li> They took a while to get here, but they ended up coming the day before the first estimated dilevery date. They&#x27;re smaller that I was expecting them to be but they work just as I was hoping they would. Doing nail art has never been so fun and easy before. The price is great and I would recomend them to anyone thinking about buying dotting tools</li>
    <li> I bought these to give as a gift to one of my friends and their amazing! I would defintly recommend this to everyone and they came really fast and were super cheep</li>
    <li> Work great and last very long I love all the range in size and way better then toothpicks and bobby pins (for about the same price)</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered.  Take a while to get here but good price made up for it&lt;br /&gt;and worth waiting.</li>
    <li> This product works just like i expected. for the prices you get great quality. i have had no issue over the past week with these dotters. i use them for tribal print, polka dots, flowers, etc. on my nail designs.</li>
    <li> So there are 5 tools and all together 5 different dotting sizes. Tried them all out and I think they work pretty well. I&#x27;m not the most fanciest manicurist but I love art and always try to experiment with my nails whenever there is free time. My nails become a little canvas of creation. Using dots to create flowers, ripples, and even little galaxies have been a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy and the customer service is even better.....good job guys</li>
    <li> This is the greatest tool I have ever boughten. It got here even before the delivery date. These dotting tools make doing designs so easy and fun.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The shipping was so fast and it was in great condition! The only thing is that one side of all the tools are the same size. That&#x27;s perfectly fine with me but you&#x27;re buying 5 different sizes and 5 of the same to be clear. This was an amazing and inexpensive buy.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them she uses them all the time. She wanted them for Christmas but we did not find them.</li>
    <li> My daughters are extremely happy with this product, they&#x27;re constantly using it. The durability and quality of the product is pretty good. The price was really good too!</li>
    <li> These are perfect and great sizes on each side. Pretty designs on them and colors. I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> The timing of my dotting tools was perfect. The size is very handy and the size of the dots are unique and have a variety. They come from super small to perfect circle size.</li>
    <li> Good tools but the end that makes the dot came off easily but thats not a big problem, u can ether glue it back on or put ut back on. The shipment was super fast!</li>
    <li> I got these because they were very inexpensive and wanted to do my nails for July 4th but did not arrive in time.  Gave them to my niece who likes to practice nail painting; not sure she likes them as well as her other nail design tools.  They did not come with any instructions or creative ideas, which I thought disappointing and they arrived about 3 weeks after I ordered them.  Cannot really comment otherwise.  Perhaps for the nail design expert who really knows what she&#x27;s doing and is willing to wait for them!</li>
    <li> the minute I got this product i test it and made some design with this. recommendation check. i love it</li>
    <li> great, we are enjoying them, thanks</li>
    <li> I actually received my package a couple weeks ago, which was several weeks ahead of schedule! Not a single complaint here. They were in perfect condition when they arrived and I&#x27;ve been putting them to good use!</li>
    <li> One of the five came apart the first time I used it, but a little glue fixed that. The dotting tools are better than using a toothpick or bobby pin.</li>
    <li> got my new dotting tools yesterday! perfect and i love them so much. just used them this morning and they work great! all different sizes to get the job done. i will be ordering from this seller again for sure.&lt;br /&gt;i have never (until now) bought anything from amazon before and i am now glad that i did! it only took 2 weeks to get them after i ordered them and very well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the dotting pens. She&#x27;s been making all types of patterns with them. She changes her nail colors often now to match her outfits.</li>
    <li> My package arrived before the estimated shipping date. It&#x27;s nice to have the different sizes and the design is simply nice to look at. This is actually better than I expected [especially for the price]. Pleased is an understatement. I can make all types of designs because of the range of sizes and easy cleaning. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These are great tools! They are made with great quality which was a nice surprise for&lt;br /&gt;Such a low price!</li>
    <li> the tips came off within a few days of getting them....i will not get again but instead will buy elsewhere</li>
    <li> Excellent, what you see is what you get.  Solid quality excellent price easy to use.  If you have a steady hand you can do a professional job.</li>
    <li> It was what I needed. It arrived sooner then stated. And I like that it was only four doting tools but different sizes on all of them. Also they are easy to work with and cute.</li>
    <li> Dotting tools, they work, look cute. But the dots look very similar to each other in size, make sure to clean the tip each time because the nail polish gets thick and doesn&#x27;t make the same size the 2nd or 3rd time around</li>
    <li> They arrived before the time estimated.....the only bad thing about it is that the green one was missing the other end &amp; some of them weren&#x27;t really glued in right. I had to super glue it, nothing so difficult.....but they&#x27;re still a really good use</li>
    <li> The advertisement showed the dotting tools in a closeable pouch to store them in. I did not receive the pouch shown. Most of the ends are the same size. There weren&#x27;t any big enough to make good size dots. Tools were so tiny. Picture showed good size tools in a human hand. They were so short and thin that its very difficult to use them. Not what I expected. Was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love them I use them daily I ordered another set yesterday and I will recomend them to others ...... ....... ......,,.</li>
    <li> same as the picture on the website&lt;br /&gt;when you hold it it feels good since it has decent size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can not wait to use it</li>
    <li> Just what I need it and great price...I love this product it works great and very professional for the money</li>
    <li> Came on time and they work perfectly. would recommend to someone that loves nail art such as myself. good job</li>
    <li> Incredible tools for a great price. The acrylic is strong and smooth and the tips make great dots and circles. This was a great purchase that proves the saying you get what you pay for isn&#x27;t always right.</li>
    <li> Works great, as described functions properly, really great look. I love it so much i use it every time i do my nails</li>
    <li> Once I received the dotting tools I immediately did my nails &amp; these tools work wonderful!! ... My polka dot designs looks so proffesional ... I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say i&#x27;m a mid way nail chic that could either do her nails once a month or every week. When i bought these i was just lloking for generic brand because i know that me doing my nails could sometimes be an unknown. So i didn&#x27;t want to sit there and spends 10-15 bucks (-__- really!) for something i might not even be using all the time. So the price was aa plus that pulled me in, but suprisingly it has multiple uses you have a god range in sizes so you can have a variety in yoaar dots, but i also found that i could use the smaller dotting tools as a liner(which kind of pissed me off cause it worked better than the 6.59 liners i bought) so overall for the price it has pretty great quality and usage options.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping! :) My daughter and I have been doing some pretty awesome designs with these and we are soooo glad we got them!! :) Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The nail art dotters were a great price for getting a set of 5 pens with 10 different size dotters. Some of the tips seem to be pretty close to the same size or the same, but there&#x27;s still plenty of size range and variety in the set.</li>
    <li> 4/5 because it was hard for me to clean without breaking the tip off on the handle - but I&#x27;m rough with all my equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Good for first-time dotters! Variety of sizes (dual ended making 10 total dot sizes) and very fun to look at ouo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend easy for any creative soul who wants to try their hand at a cutepolish YouTube video</li>
    <li> The set was smaller than I thought it was gonna be and two of they broke already and I only used it twice</li>
    <li> I was excited to recieve these, it took about 3 weeks to get to California but they arrived before the estimated date. I was disappointed that there are only 5 different sizes, not 10. 5 of the dotting tools are all the same. But they do what I need them too. And they are cute</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect. Gave them away as gifts to feiends and co-workers. Big hit. Will buy again soon!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price!!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and good quality</li>
    <li> i love these they are professional and makes awesome dots.  I save at my nail shop i go to because my guy charges 10$ for my dots lol/.  Im able to make perfect dots myself which is good!  these do what they do make dots for nail design.  totally recommend.&lt;br /&gt;They were delivered faster than expected</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these and she  is having so much fun making different designs with them.  The colors are fun for young girls and the price was great!</li>
    <li> The have been great for making designs on nails!</li>
    <li> The products are exactly like the picture shown, I received all the different colors of the tools. I wouldn&#x27;t say they are all different dotting sizes. There are two dotting sizes that is different, but the rest are the same size.</li>
    <li> Awesome cool variety of sizes and these Colors are really cute. The little inside is cool with twisted colors hard to describe but buy them</li>
    <li> Love my buy....arrived sooner then expected</li>
    <li> I thought the sizes were going to be different. They are really tiny. I never even used them! In the photo they look different that what you actually receive.</li>
    <li> Great quality at a great price !</li>
    <li> It works fairly well but it&#x27;s not what I expected it to be</li>
    <li> The tips fall off easily hard to stay on</li>
    <li> I use it for nail art, and it works really well.</li>
    <li> I bought a set of these a while back and really love them. But, I just bought another set on here. looking in the package I noticed one end the balls were 4 different sizes as they should be, but the other end of the package all 4 balls were the same and were the same as one on the opposite end. So instead of having 8 different sizes I have 5 of the same size and 3 others.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they were the same as my last pack. It seems too much of a hassle to send them back now.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE these!! They help so much with doing my nails! BUT I was disapointed with the colors... They aren&#x27;t as bright as they are in the picture.. they are all a Pale green, pale pink and so on... I was hoping they&#x27;d be brighter.. BUT they still get the job done and very well!!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are so cool and super affordable, and I love how they come in many different sizes, they are so cute and neat.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Love it,  thank you,  very pleased.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you why this is a no buy.&lt;br /&gt;- 6 of the tips were the same of 2 sizes so I basically only got 4 different sizes&lt;br /&gt;- the size is too small: I&#x27;ve bought a better normal set in the past but then i sold it off (bad choice)&lt;br /&gt;- they&#x27;re skinny ans thin and weird; but if you like skinny and thin, this is the right size for you!&lt;br /&gt;Lemme say that if you ONLY want it as a simple dotting tool, then go for this. It&#x27;s cheap and it does fill the doings of making dots.</li>
    <li> got them as a gift. they are exactly what i expected. hope she likes them and uses them a lot</li>
    <li> Gave this to my niece as she is into creating intricate designs on nails. She really likes it, I have not personally used them.</li>
    <li> this product is extremely sturdy. what i didnt like about it is the sizes are the same. if you want to get it, go for it. its worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about purchasing this product because of some of the reviews I read but I am extremely impressed! It actually came exactly as it looks on the picture even though in the description warns that the colors or design may vary. On one end, the sizes vary perfectly as they do in the picture and on the other end they are basically all the same size (so there is kind of no point in having the second ends other then as extras in case you&#x27;re using different colors of the same size dots or something). But overall, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better turnout. None of them were broken and so far they seem pretty sturdy and even though it felt like forever for them to be delivered, they actually got to me at least 4 days before the expected shipping date (they may have been delivered a few days even earlier then that since I don&#x27;t check my mailbox very often).</li>
    <li> There is barely a noticeable size variation on the balls. They&#x27;re roughly the same sizes and the other side of the tool all the dots are the same size as well. I saw them at the beauty supply for 7.99 yipes</li>
    <li> They arrived when the company said they would and were in perfect condition ,and most importantly they work fine considering how cheap they were. I&#x27;m not sure how durable they are considering the price but they do what their supposed to.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have any complaints. I love the dotting pens. They get the job done and they are really cute too.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time but broke just cleaning the tip there is a reason why its so cheap you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> These pens came in a plastic sleeve for easy storage. I was floored by how high quality these are. They are sturdy, made out of quality heavy materials, and honestly do create perfect dots for nail art! Cleaning them is easy and the myriad of tip sizes makes for variety in dot sizes for nails.  I would purchase these again and again if I were to ever lose them.</li>
    <li> These make dotting polish a breeze.  All the different sizes are awesome. It does take a little practice. I practiced on paper before using on my nails.  You need to practice how much pressure to apply. You can vary the size of the dot by changing the amount of pressure you apply with even the biggest tool. Love them.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this dotting tools</li>
    <li> The designs that can be made with these pens are really beautiful:) But I wish that some of the pens would be capable to draw lines</li>
    <li> these tools are not only pretty they are sturdy and affordable, just all around great utensils. i would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I liked them very well.  One pen had a loose end and it would not stay in but overall They work great.  I did receive 3 packages of them and i only ordered one.  Did i get charged for more than one?  I sure hope not.  Cost to much to have them shipped back.</li>
    <li> Great product! These are the exact same thing that you can buy at Sally&#x27;s Beauty!</li>
    <li> Got here on time, Love the colors</li>
    <li> They work just fine but it took sooo long to ship to my house. I forgot I ordered it by the time it came to my house.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for my product</li>
    <li> these dotting brush pens are the greatest purchase i have made. they allow me to make great flower designs and so much more. i would recommend these to anyone. they arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner then estimated and the product is good quality!</li>
    <li> They quality is great, they&#x27;re perfect and now I have endless nail art possibilies!! Love them!! Exactly what it says they are, and came very quick, super cheap. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> they are ok. I read the reviews so i knew what i was getting into. You really only get 4 different sizes. One pen is the same on both sides along with the ends to the other 4... it was cheap so whatever</li>
    <li> I was so excited when these came in the mail, and I couldn&#x27;t be more in love with them!  I use them all the time, and they are still in great shape! So worth it, and you definitely can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> It came in a really small package! I thought it was something else! But no, it was this, and they&#x27;re basically the size of mechanical pencils only skinnier. It came 6 days before it would be said as &amp;#34;late&amp;#34;. They weren&#x27;t broken, and that&#x27;s all I can say for now since I just now opened the package! Meaning I haven&#x27;t used it. So yeah, it&#x27;s pretty cheap! You should buy a few 😊</li>
    <li> She loves creating great nail art with the tools.  They are a great length and easy for her to use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that these have two ends!  More sizes to work with and it takes up less space in my nail art collection.  Plus, comes with a nifty little case to keep them stowed away in.  Shipping was SUPER fast.  Definitely a necessity.</li>
    <li> They were nice. But they took to long to get here. I didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t coming for the United States. Sorry</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get here, yes, but good quality so far! They&#x27;re cheap and they work</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and the price is fair. The only thing is the waiting but that&#x27;s about it. Makes nail designing easy and fun.</li>
    <li> NOT HARD TO DO. I LOVE DOING MY NAILS WITH THEM. I COME WITH DIFFERNT ART DESIGN MYSELF. I WILL RECOMMENDED THIS TO ANYONE WHO LIKE DOING NAILS THEIR SELF</li>
    <li> The Tools Were Very Inexpensive!👍 &amp;&#x27; Are Easy To Use. 😊</li>
    <li> One of the tips fell out.  Not happy about that!  Am now in the processing of getting that rectified.</li>
    <li> After I ordered mine I was nervous from the reviews but mine all got here in one piece and weeks later they are all still intact. I love them</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great quality and with good care can last a long time.  Easy to use and give great results.  Have gotten compliments from friends thinking that I went to a salon.</li>
    <li> Bought these tools for my daughter.  She loves them and they were a great price.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described</li>
    <li> Very nice for making flowers on your nails. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Fun and easy to design nails with</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these dotting tools work perfect with any kind of polish and 10 total for 1.60 is perfect</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and great quality</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for.  One of the tips was broken.</li>
    <li> really awesome, gave it to my best friend as a gift and she loves it. she is very big on nail art so i&#x27;ve expanded her designing tools.</li>
    <li> One of the end pieces came right out as soon as I took it out the package for use. Delivery was way too long. Not as big as in the picture.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed. Two of the dot metal things are coming out of the plastic holder and several appear to be the same size. However the smaller dots make great use of being cleaners when I get the gel on my skin.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift for my granddaughter, she enjoys doing her nails so I knew she would like this.  I bought this along with some nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for.  Cool design too</li>
    <li> i guess they are okay for the money i hardly have use them but for twice takes too long to paint</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that everyone got there pens fast on the other hand I&#x27;ve been waiting for mine for almost 2 months! Along with some gems that I ordered the same day same people. Very frustrating!!</li>
    <li> They were a gift for my Granddaughter and she loved them!! It was exactly what she wanted for her birthday!!</li>
    <li> These nail art tools are great. They are a grey size and a great price! They came in earlier than expected! I hope to purchase more products from this retailer</li>
    <li> The first set I bought came in a nice pouch. This set came in a plastic bag that is cheap and will tear easy.</li>
    <li> Arrived very very fast and u get exactly what u see however they don&#x27;t make dots any better then I could have done with the nail brushes I already have the dots don&#x27;t look that great with these so I was disappointed</li>
    <li> For the price, the best design tips I have seen. Bought to work in polymer clay. They fit the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> I got the items earlier than the estimated arrival date. Received all the size and in good condition. If you ever experience the tips falling off, just put super glue on it and it&#x27;s good as new. All tips on one side of each tool are the same exact size but the other side has 5 different sizes which looks exactly the same as the one in the picture. I&#x27;m not sure if anyone noticed but if you flip the green tool on the picture, all of them are the same size on one side.  I was almost afraid I won&#x27;t receive the item but didn&#x27;t want to leave a review before the estimated arrival date. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Work well but I had a tip break off and I had to fox it and put it back on- only complaint. But it does make the dots look neater and I lo e the different sizes</li>
    <li> Shipping took a long time and 2 of the tips kept falling out, had to glue them in.</li>
    <li> My artistic ability seems to be dot centered so these are great.  One of the ends fell out, but I just glued it back in.  I&#x27;m not a professional so for a weekend nail artist, these are just fine for the price.  Shipping takes a little longer, but I received all my order.  Be a little patient.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and they were in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what you would expect when ordering bracelets like this</li>
    <li> good price and the product coming earlier</li>
    <li> was exactly what my daughter wanted, took a long time to get here but was worth the wait for her</li>
    <li> Sturdy. Good material and nice size to hold. Surprising easy to use left handed!</li>
    <li> Im not some random paid person. The tracking wasn&#x27;t very detailed and the shipping time was weeks, but it came way sooner!  Its beautiful, durable and the price is unbeatable. Worth it!</li>
    <li> As expected. A good product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Yes this met all my expectations. Great use out of them doing DIY nailart . less expensive then salons. Would recommend buying.shipped here a lot sooner to California from China I believe than it stated.</li>
    <li> very useful and great quality</li>
    <li> They work great and at a spectacular price.</li>
    <li> Love these. You won&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere in stores. If you do, it&#x27;s over priced. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> great for making designs</li>
    <li> Love these! My daughter and I have so much fun now making designs on her nails. Makes it so easy!</li>
    <li> Works really well!! Satisfied (:</li>
    <li> They came perfectly packaged and they&#x27;re super easy to clean :) I use them on clients all the time!</li>
    <li> Nice good shape took a while to come in.</li>
    <li> Easy to used and very affordable.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> These are great!! They came a bit late but im very pleased with them. Id say clean them as soon as you are done or the nail polish is a chore to get off. But it.makes perfect dots and i love using them to do.my nails</li>
    <li> These are basically scoring tools.  That&#x27;s what I bought them for for card making.  They have multiple size tips, which works great for different weights of paper.  And they are fun colors.</li>
    <li> Was exactly as described. Works great! Makes nail art simple and easy, I love it! Included all sizes so i can decorate all length of nails for myself and for my daughter/nieces!</li>
    <li> Shipment was slow,  but item was described correctly.  The pricing was good. Good on packaging.  I really love this item, it make cool dots on my short fingernails.</li>
    <li> i do nails and i absotively, posilutely love these!! i&#x27;ve been wanting a dotting kit for the longest and these are perfect. cheap and totally worth the buy, i promise!!</li>
    <li> I think they are very useful when making the perfect dot, I just wish each end had a totally different tool on each end. I have not had the chance to use them much, but they seem okay to me.</li>
    <li> I ordered a lot of Christmas presents this year. When these came, I had forgotten what they were to be used for. My husband also was puzzled about what they could be used to do. Eventually I checked my account to remind me. If someone knows how to use these on nails, then they would be great for you, I suppose. I haven&#x27;t got a clue and they have been sitting around--don&#x27;t know what to do with them. They&#x27;re pretty, I guess. They are pretty heavy, too.</li>
    <li> It is very nice to have different size dotting tools.  I am a DIY, not a professional and I am just practicing with designs.  But these seem to work fantastic.</li>
    <li> I thought these were the big dotting tools but there actually the small ones, not complaining just saying but its a really good product. I just have to learn how to do it correctly lol</li>
    <li> Comes with different sizes fine, medium, large good quality, pretty, easy to use. Reasonably priced would recommend this productto anyone</li>
    <li> This product has great quality and it works very well! I definetly reccomend it to anyone out their&lt;br /&gt;Who wants to give it a try!</li>
    <li> Very useful &amp; nice product.</li>
    <li> They work great! i&#x27;ve wanted some for so long and once i got these i was set</li>
    <li> Very cute and came quickly. Can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> Just as described, speedy shipping!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Love it, arrive earlier then what I expected.</li>
    <li> takes ages to get to you ( which is okay they warn you about this) but once you get them so great! love the nail are i can make with these</li>
    <li> Love these so much! Came in right on time and so worth it!! Will definitely order from this company again!:)))</li>
    <li> Cheap, easy and fun to use and make nail designs with.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my wife and she like them</li>
    <li> it works just like any other dotting tool&lt;br /&gt;one end of each of the five are the same size ball point&lt;br /&gt;the other end although is different size, biggest to smallest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with that being said you can share them and misplace one and you&#x27;d still be fine ^^</li>
    <li> These work wonderfully as dotting tools, and as a tool to reset my modem. My son is enthralled by the ribbony color bands in the handles.</li>
    <li> Does what it´s supposed to, what else can I say :)</li>
    <li> I gave a set to each of my granddaughters ages 10 and 11 years old they found them easy to use and loved the effects on their nails</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I ordered. It came in a timely manner and I have no complaints.. The sizes were all different on 1 end and the same on the other. They are a really great deal. :)</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product for the money. My daughter uses it constantly and is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for creating dotted nail designs. My daughters and I are having a blast with these. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> They are really nice, I love that they are all different color. Light weigh, perfect set of nail art tools. Great price. Highly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product!!! It was a gift for my daughter. The price was great!!! Also, these dotting tools are dual ended for a more accurate design and variety!!! So worth waiting a month to receive!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice set of tools for the asking price! They are small but enable you to do fine detail work!</li>
    <li> I love doing nail designs and these are good for so many uses other than nails for other detailing and painting also.</li>
    <li> Lets me go over the key basics of this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping- took a long time. Around 2-3 weeks, and a week earlier than the estimated date. I ordered it on Dec 26, came January 17. Not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product- came in excellent condition! I receive all 5 dotting tools, none broken or missing. Very pleases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks- i received all 5 colors and they appear much smaller in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use- I cannot even describe how much i love these tools! They&#x27;re so easy to use for nail art and it turns out wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i am very satisfied with this product and for the price, theyre good quality! I would buy this again and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are very easy to use such afordable price for these to. I love the pattern it has on it aswell</li>
    <li> There perfect! They do look smaller in person then in the pic. There about 5 inches but they fit perfect in the hand there very comfortable holding. There all different sizes. Well worth the price. Oh and they came within 2 weeks of ordering.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to receive</li>
    <li> Dotting pens look just as they do in picture.  I bought them for my 17 year old daughter and she loves them.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I added these to my basket of nail paraphernalia. I think everyone that does their own nails should order these. They are awesome. It took me a few tries to get the hang of working these, but now I love them!</li>
    <li> this is an item that every person that is a manicurist should have and their box  they are very handy and useful thank you</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter for her clay. They were very nice, but seem to crack really easy.</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for have a year really bad product</li>
    <li> I just loved these dotting tools. For the price i did not expect such a good quality.</li>
    <li> Received quickly.  These work great, I have no complaints about them at all.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use and very good quality for the price. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but they&#x27;re awesome.</li>
    <li> I Know they are going to be amazing when i use them but they took a very long time to come to my house and i had to wait about 2 months! I am very upset!</li>
    <li> perfect love the colors! using for crafts! different sizes! bought with my points.</li>
    <li> These are great, do a great job of making dots of different sizes, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> One of the points were broke off</li>
    <li> Now I could start my nails love it</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Love the set, some people mentioned getting all the same tools.. mine were not. They were all different size dots thank god lol pretty sturdy set too ty!</li>
    <li> After ordering this product it said it would be a while, i was fine with this. Well the estimated time came and went and i wrote to them and asked what was taking so long, then they said they will send me another one but it would be another long while and i waited for that long while to come and go at this point it had been 6 months. All though I still want the product i filed a claim and will just have to get it some where else. Maybe it was just me that has experienced this with this shipper but normally I get all my products that I purchase, and this is not like me to leave a bad comment, but it is needed to know that it takes a long time and it may never come.</li>
    <li> Different sizes like it says. Pretty good quality. I mean can&#x27;t mess these up to much when if they are cheap. Came earlier then expected</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Cheap. Ordered for my wife and she said they work great</li>
    <li> These work amazingly and easily apply nail dots without a struggle</li>
    <li> took forever to get but they are fabulous to use and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for what I needed them for! I do polymer clay art, and I needed some tiny ball tools to make textures on my art. These come in a HUGE variety of sizes, ans each end really is a different size than the others. I imagine it would work great for nail art, as I&#x27;ve used it for painting some of my clay, too, and it wipes off really easily. They&#x27;re a good length, and the width of them is easy to hold in the hand.</li>
    <li> One of the doppers broke the second day we received them. Good price you get what you paid for. My daughter enjoys them so its fine</li>
    <li> These work very well. I wish the biggest one was a little bigger though</li>
    <li> great product nice pretty colors I recommend it to anyone . works perfect to make nice pretty nail designs. I really recommend it</li>
    <li> I use these tools every time I re-do my toenails. I love to make polka dots on my big toes. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my fingernails yet, but will soon.</li>
    <li> These are dirt cheap and I use them a couple times a week at least.  If you&#x27;re thinking about getting into nail art, you need these!</li>
    <li> I have used these countless times for adding different sixed dots to my designs.  A few of them look the same size, but there is still plenty of variety. A definite value for the price.  I know they say that you can make dotting tools out of common household items but sometimes, you just want the proper tools for the job.</li>
    <li> These are actually great for the price you pay, they are not flimsy at all :)</li>
    <li> I had been looking for these forever and couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere. Finally found them and was a little weary about the price but I read customer reviews so I felt comfortable ordering. Product came almost 2 weeks earlier than what it was supposed to and in a neat little case. They work just like they are supposed to and are very durable. You can&#x27;t beat the price! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these. They are a great price and the description matches them perfectly! I love how I got five tools that were a 2 way tool :) so all in all I actually got 10 different size dotting tools for a great low cost!</li>
    <li> The dotting pens are a new constant staple for my polymer clay. The shipping time was exceedingly short and the products were amazing. I now use them every day. I also am a painter and will be using these for small details.</li>
    <li> I ordered them for my daughter she is 13 and she loves them. Thank you for such good tools for the nails. She was using toothpicks and tape.</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time and I&#x27;m satisfied with it. It does what it is meant to do and the price makes it even better! It is handy and easy to use. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Saw these on Pinterest and bought them right away. Before I bought these I was using the end of a bobby pin to make polka dot designs for my nails which wasn&#x27;t a big deal but I prefer having these pens and holding them comfortably rather than a thin bobby pin. The tips come in different sizes and I love the colors. They make great designs which will get you plenty of compliments. Not disappointed :)</li>
    <li> Amazing for clay work</li>
    <li> Came broken, no replacement</li>
    <li> These are great dotting tools for nail art or painting.  After using them for a while, the metal tip fell out on one of them but I can push it back in and it&#x27;s stable enough to use.  great price!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, nice assortment of sizes</li>
    <li> use it every time I do a manicure</li>
    <li> Exacly what I looked for</li>
    <li> Love them look just like the picture and came super fast</li>
    <li> Got these for my 13 year old daughter- she loved the colors and the design of the sticks- great value</li>
    <li> Bought for my tween niece, she had wanted the ones from sephora but I found these and she LOVES them!  great product but be prepared to wait a while for delivery!</li>
    <li> i love this produce but my only complaint is that they fall apart easily. its easy to put back together, but it doesn&#x27;t always stay.</li>
    <li> I can barely use them because they are too small. I thought the smallest would be the bigger one on the green. Don&#x27;t get these unless you want super smell dots</li>
    <li> Fast delivery ...great variety of sizes</li>
    <li> love these dotting tools - they are the perfect size dots!</li>
    <li> They do wonderfully with my polymer clay. I couldn&#x27;t be happier since the price was amazing as well as the quality</li>
    <li> Ive had for quite some time now and they are great. I would have liked more variety in ball size but for the price I definitely cannot complain. They arrived within a week and well packaged. I would repurchase</li>
    <li> I bought this set of nail tools for my granddaughter and she loves it.  The quality is very good and they are easy to use for nail art.</li>
    <li> they work great except that i have to glue one tip down cuz it was loose when i got it but they are perfect</li>
    <li> These are really nice dotting tools and cheap which makes them even better haha, they came in quickly and sealed in a nice little bubble wrap envelope, they even have a letter stating they have a two year warranty! That&#x27;s wonderful no one ever offers warranty for small products like this, it may just be from the seller I purchased it from but I&#x27;m very impressed with this product overall even if the warranty wasn&#x27;t offer it would still get a five star rating its great quality and a great price</li>
    <li> Received It Earlier Than I Expected! Great Product Can&#x27;t Wait To See What Kind Of Nail Designs I&#x27;ll Create ! :)</li>
    <li> The product was great, and exactly what i wanted and expected. My only issue was, it took a bit longer than it said for me to recieve it.&lt;br /&gt;So great product, slow delivery.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly for my dotting designs on my nails.</li>
    <li> Great price....great product!</li>
    <li> I really liked these fun little tools for my nails, but don&#x27;t expect them to be quick. And a letter of instructions would have been awesome for people who aren&#x27;t girly, like myself.</li>
    <li> I just got these today, the shipping was about 2 weeks. The packaging was great, nothing was ripped or torn. They look exactly like the picture I saw. I bought these mainly for polymer clay use, but they are the right size for nail art too. Overall, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Great quality! I actually use these to massage my fingers and hands. Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> These are fantastic, the work really well for using on nails.  I also use them on paintings and other artwork I do.  Fun tool for kids to use too.</li>
    <li> Great tools and are not just for nails. I have already found so many uses for these sturdy tools. They are very well made, easy to use and are not a one trick item. I have used them to dot around a photo frame and around the knobs on a dresser up-do. You too will not regret getting these. Oh and they work wonders on nails too :)</li>
    <li> They work perfectly, I was super excited when I received them and immediately went to work on my nails! The outcome was perfect!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are just what I needed. They have held up great, I was slightly worried about the quality since they were at such a great price but they are perfect and easily cleaned.</li>
    <li> These worked just like they are supposed to!  I have no complaints!! Would recommend to anyone who is looking for them!</li>
    <li> Love these! I can make all kinds of nail designs. Don&#x27;t like that when I try to clean off nail polish (with cotton ball) the tips come off. I&#x27;ve thought about just crazy gluing them? Not a big enough deal to make me dislike the product.</li>
    <li> I like the variety of sizes.</li>
    <li> SHIPPING TOOK A WHILE BUT IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED! THESE ARE GREAT FOR MY AT HOME NAIL DESIGNS.</li>
    <li> My girls loved this product, good quality</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying these dotting tools. The first time I ordered them I dropped one and the dotting part fell out but I was still able to use it and they were all different sizes. The second time I ordered these, one side had all different sizes but the opposite ends had all similar sizes so I was a bit disappointed because they weren&#x27;t like the first ones I had received. I do still use the dotting tools since the sizes are perfect for the designs I make on my nails</li>
    <li> This product is great. i&#x27;ve used it a couple of times. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, it&#x27;s even fun looking what with the spirals and colors and all. I got the product in a timely manner and it&#x27;s much easier to desgin with rather then thinking of alternatives. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Really cute tools and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Works well and is well made.</li>
    <li> Got these for my granddaughter - she uses to make very creative nail art.</li>
    <li> I was surprised- It came very early! Works great, everything i expected. I love dong my own nails and I look forward to having alot of fun with these, would definetly buy again if needed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was expecting the multiple colors of dotting tools so I could better distinguish and remember the sizes that were associated with which, but I got only pink. :/ Oh well. They work for my clay modeling so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Some look like they&#x27;re the same size besides one or two of them!!! But I do like them though!! Can&#x27;t beat the price once more!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the items to be so small. I have other dotting tools myself, but they weren&#x27;t that small. This item is a bit thin and the dotting part is too small for some nails! I would rather pay a little bit more for better quality.</li>
    <li> easy to use and comes in different sizes. you can make dots small, medium, or big. it looks very cute on nails.</li>
    <li> Order arrived TEN DAYS before the first day of estimated delivery, shipping is fast and fantastic. Dotting tools  were not damaged and work wonderfully! The dotting tools are smaller than they appear, which is wonderful for precision and comfort! Would buy again. And you can&#x27;t beat the price,</li>
    <li> Great quality for the cost...Set exactly as described and pictured...received earlier then expected..perfect for novice detailing and nail art. Good addition to my manicure set.</li>
    <li> This might be one of my favorite amazon purchases. These allow you so much creativity and they work so well. I received my package sooner than I thought I would so I was pleased</li>
    <li> LOVE these! I never knew making dots on nail polish could be so much fun.  Our 6 year old enjoys wearing her polish dotted.. SO easy and produces excellent results.</li>
    <li> Some people complain that some of the sizes are the same, in my opinion you don&#x27;t really need that many sizes of dots.. you can just keep dotting to make them bigger. Definitely use these a lot.</li>
    <li> This is a good product it took a while to come. When i got them i didnt know how to use them but i knew i wouldnt know and i would have to learn. The only thing is that the are very smooth and hard to hold but i can still hold them pretty good.</li>
    <li> This arrived exactly as the picture looked and 2 weeks earlier than expected!!</li>
    <li> They came before estimated shipping time and work AMAZING! I love them! I tried them as soon as I got them. It&#x27;s easy to remove the nail polish and are super cute with the colors :) Exactly as advertised. Definitely recommend to any one who love to do there nails!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these nail art dotting tools I mostly use them for my polymer clay crafts but sometimes for my nails they arrived on time and they&#x27;re really good quality the only thing I have to say about them is that the pink one the dotting part of it fell out so I just had to glue it back but other than that is really nice quality and I love it</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are the best. Good quality and works really good for nail designs. Trouble free, fast shipment and the quality of the tools for the price is even better.</li>
    <li> These nail dotters work great! I love the different sizes. Makes lines and dots and all other designs super easy!</li>
    <li> They work wonderfully and get the job done! I love the different sizes and they&#x27;re easy to use. I definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> I like these, their a cheap and easy way to get creative with my nails</li>
    <li> easy to use and gets the dots perfect. Love these.</li>
    <li> took a little longer to arrive than I expected but still a wonderful product. I got exactly what I ordered with no problems and for the price the wait was worth it.</li>
    <li> i really like the colors and how easy it is to use. would buy a couple more for the holidays</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t wait to draw snowmen with them next year</li>
    <li> Perfect for use with polymer clay.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these. She uses them almost every time she paints her nails. The price was good but it took almost 3 weeks to recive</li>
    <li> kept seeing videos of a girl on you tube working magic with these in clay, I am not sure I am as giffed as she but maybe with enough practice at leaste I have the right tools.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this, this is the perfect stocking stuffer or gift for tween girl. Could throw them in a gift basket with other nail accessories</li>
    <li> The price, obviously, was fine.  But, as one poster said, know that you may not be getting ten different dotting tips.  Well.  That&#x27;s what happened with me.  Actually, there were six identical tiny ball tips, and four tips that were completely different from each other.  Now, for $1.82, I can&#x27;t say I was expecting Roll Royce-quality dotting tools.  However, I DO think that when you SAY there will be ten different tips, there should BE ten different tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the FIRST time I&#x27;ve ever ordered anything from Amazon, and it was not what I was expecting and was told in the ad when I ordered that it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onward and upward.  I won&#x27;t be ordering from these people again.</li>
    <li> Came in a timely manner. Just what I expected they would be. My daughter loves them.</li>
    <li> Even though it took several weeks to get, the wait was worth it. I can now make polka dots on my nails with the tools and no longer need toothpicks. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Almost all of the dotting pens are the same sizes, but for the price paid, it&#x27;s worth it and it&#x27;s something I can live with. These are great for making designs on your nails, and I use them every week. Great product!</li>
    <li> works well. but after using each one, you really don&#x27;t need all these sizes. you really only need two, the smallest and the biggest. the other ones do what the smallest and biggest ones do. so getting a 5 piece is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Just what I was hoping for... Looks excactly like on the pic. Great buy! Worth more then I paid.love it</li>
    <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT! I can now use the different dot makers for all my nail needs, awesome!</li>
    <li> They work just like the salons! I love it.  I finally can do my nails just like the salons can!</li>
    <li> These nail dotting pens are great, easy to use and would buy again, I do recommend them to my friends.</li>
    <li> Not all of the tools are different sizes as advertised and it took a while for them to arrive (though still within the expected arrival time). Overall though, they are cheap and do what I need them to.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few nail art sets in the past that have been much more expensive than this, but I&#x27;m happiest with this set. I&#x27;ll point out a few things about the set that make it worth the purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Price: There&#x27;s no way to beat this price. I don&#x27;t even know how they make a profit on this after manufacturing and shipping, but I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;-Use your own colors: I bought the Migi nail art pens and was moderately satisfied with those, but each set has 8 colors and you have to buy a whole new set if you want a different color. With these \\&quot;Dotting pens\\&quot; I just dab a bit of polish on a piece of paper and dip the end in and make my designs. I can use any of my colors and don&#x27;t have to worry about the end clogging up like with the pen,&lt;br /&gt;-Simple: Easy to use, easy to clean.  I have done polka dots, hearts and paw prints. They are easy to do and for cleaning I just put nail polish remover on a paper towel and the tips clean up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Case: The flimsy plastic case mine came in was broke. It&#x27;s not a big deal, but I thought I&#x27;d mention it. This is the only negative I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase and will maybe be buying some sets for friends at Christmas.</li>
    <li> A friend introduced these to me.  I have always wanted to do nail art but was afraid to try.  I watched her do a cheetah print on her fingernails using these tools and was inspired to buy a set of my own!  I got a steal on them!  Great price!  I can&#x27;t wait to play with them some more!</li>
    <li> I do like this product and they work very well, however a few of the dotting tips are the same sizes.</li>
    <li> My dotting tools arrived fast!!! Unbeatable price!!! Highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s so easy to use and helps you create amazing designs</li>
    <li> These 5 X 2way Dotting Pen Marbleizing Tool Nail Art Paint Seaweed A1, work just fine and are pretty cute</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was watching videos on how to do pretty designs on nails online. They work great.</li>
    <li> I really love this product itdoes everything it suppose every time i do a nail art project I use this nail dotting tool i recommend this to anyone who needs a dotting tool</li>
    <li> Great..i love different sizes. .</li>
    <li> expected them to be bigger as they are &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; but love them. very helpful :)</li>
    <li> Arrived before the expected arrival date.  Just what I expected the points are the different sizes and they are cute.</li>
    <li> Great! Very sturdy, i use them for polymer clay and they are great with texture and adding small details</li>
    <li> They look great and they come in good size.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as shown. I&#x27;ve learned to draw with mine and don&#x27;t need to buy nail pens. I love all the different sizes.</li>
    <li> My package came in earlier than expected and it looks exactly like in the picture except the colours aren&#x27;t as bright as shown. But other than that I&#x27;m very satisfied! :)</li>
    <li> Excellent items, works perfect.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s meant to do and cheap.</li>
    <li> Fantastic price and easy to use</li>
    <li> I had all kinds of fun using these.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. The colorfulness makes each easy to distinguish. Although not all the endings are different. So there is a total of 6 different endings when there should be 10. Okay for the price i guess.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly what I expected! Very pretty design. Takes a little long to receive so make sure you order with time to spare if you need this product for a specific date.</li>
    <li> The Shipping was fast and the product looks great 👍 thank you !</li>
    <li> OK for the price.  Duplicate sizes and one tool broke after a week but for as inexpensive as they were I am content with using them.</li>
    <li> They were shipped to me very fast and look just like the picture! Cant wait to use them all the time!</li>
    <li> They were mini and nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> I found out that I didnt really need a dotting tool after I opened this package. I could have used the tip of a ballpoint pen just as well. Nothing special about it that you would need a &amp;#34;dotting&amp;#34; tool for it.....</li>
    <li> I no longer have to search the house for little items to do my nails!  These tools are durable and have a total of 10 components to utilize.  This set is a MUST HAVE for anyone obsessed with doing nails!</li>
    <li> Item was as described by owner and came on time. Love them! I do my nails all the time, better than salon</li>
    <li> Daughter likes her acryLic uv</li>
    <li> These design pens are very well made, and perfect for any kind of dotting, or nail art in general. These are a must have for anyone who does nail art.</li>
    <li> One came broken but you can just slide the metal  part back in. Other than that they work great</li>
    <li> they metal part is to short so i have to tilt my paint and my paint goes everywhere BUT i really do love it so thats why i gave it 4 stars. I would buy it again if the dotting parts gets bigger.</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are okay.</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail art set for my grand daughter.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> These are cool dotting pens, they come in different sizes which is good to make different designs and perfect for kids little nails</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I wasn&#x27;t very pleased because it took a while to get here and when it did I looked at it and the sizes on four of the tools were all of the same size. Also the green one broke but that wasn&#x27;t anything glue couldn&#x27;t fix but I shouldn&#x27;t have had to do that anyway. Other than Rhodes things they work great and are good for the price.</li>
    <li> IT IS AFFORDABLE AND EASY TO USE NEAT AND NICE AND LOVELY CAN TAKE IT ON THE GO EXCILLENT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this item; it&#x27;s so easy to work with &amp; ideas are limitless! They&#x27;re also very pretty which makes working with them fun :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> This is my first actual real nail tool and I really enjoyed using it for the first time today. They are two sided and are really sturdy. I recommend!</li>
    <li> dotting tools dont need to be expensive or fancy. this does what i need it to do and looks cute wich is just a bonus</li>
    <li> THey work well.  The price was right and I received them much quicker that I thought I would.  Great value for the money!</li>
    <li> Very shocked how quickly they came in, and they are perfect!  The different size tips give a good variety of what you can create</li>
    <li> Item arrived just a few days after placing order! Was very excited to get these and use them. Was slightly disappointed that the end of the pens not shown in the picture are all the same relative size tip. A friend pointed out that they can be used just with different colors. Not enough for me to go through the hassle of returning them. I did try using them and they worked fine...especially for the price!</li>
    <li> really well put together. cheap but took a while to get to the house. nice fit for your hands. easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I ordered these on Valentines Day &amp; I got them faster than I thought. I&#x27;m so excited to try these out! Been itching to do something new w/my nails.</li>
    <li> Everything was great except as soon as I opened the package, one of the metal pieces fell off immediately. I need to glue it back on. But the price was great and all the other dotting pens work great!</li>
    <li> Everything I was looking for! No issues or anything else worth mentioning, exactly what I was looking for and what I received.</li>
    <li> i love these. they are way cheap and work super great.  the multiple sizes are wonderful. however when i recieved mine in the mail and opend them one of the metal peices fell off.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my personal use...I am not a manicurist...they are great! The different ends make it easy for a variety of designs. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> I like it but not to much the dots are good but still worth it :D I like how the price is a nice price.</li>
    <li> I bought these to do different nail styles like a penguin or anything. They were cheap, came quickly and were as described!</li>
    <li> The quality is good. but overall i rate this a 4 out of 5. the tips were either too big to do a flower, or too small to do polka dots..</li>
    <li> works great for nail designs</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive my dotting tool, It is a easy and a versatile tool to use and have at your finger tips, There are so many designs you can create with this, excellent for drawing dots, flowers, etc, This dotting tool is great when you have a hard time dotting,&lt;br /&gt;very convenient how it&#x27;s double sided with a smaller dot, good price, and  arrived in excellent condition, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i just received them yesterday (3 or 4 weeks early :D )  and try them just to noticed me that...... THEM ARE PERFECT !! THANKS</li>
    <li> Broke super quickly. Right in half too I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Long wait on shipping</li>
    <li> I have been wanting these for a while and when I found them on Amazon I was thrilled at the price. I have used them and they work exactly like they are supposed to. High quality and great price.</li>
    <li> One of the tool&#x27;s metal pieces was not in the tool it was floating around the bag when it got here not really broken just loose and fell out of the tool I guess. I can glue it in place no big deal. Everything else looked good.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery happy with the purchase! Recommended !!</li>
    <li> These are lovely and work wonderfully! I was a little skeptical at first before buying them because of the negative reviews saying how the dots at the end comes off but they don&#x27;t with mine. The results are so cute too!! I will definitely be using these a lot!:)</li>
    <li> These nail art tools were a gift for my teenage daughter who loves to paint her nails and create a variety of designs on them. They were such a great price and are very durable. We like the attractive design of the tools and the variety of colors the set came in (see picture of item). The nail art tools also arrived ahead of schedule, which I love since they were a gift! I would recommend these to anyone who loves to do their own nails!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get better for the price. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Loveeeeee these they are perfect they work so well it&#x27;s crazy. With such a cheap price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Really cute.  I do my mom&#x27;s nails for her and these are a great addition to the tools I use.  They are sturdy and super cute.  The sizes are nice, and considering they came from China they arrived really fast.  Totally worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THEM.  I AM HAVING A BALL.  I LOVE ART OF MOST ANY KIND. I AM ENJOYING NAIL ART &amp; ITS GREAT.  I TAKE UP HOURS HAVING FUN WITH THESE ART DESIGN TIPS. BEFORE I PURCHASED THEM I WAS USING TOOTH PICKS.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Great for detailing your manicure. 5 star seller. HIGHLY recommended!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very GOOD as promised</li>
    <li> Great product! However, when I got them, my white one had the tip loose to the point where it was falling out! I just put some clear nail polish on it and that seemed to fix the problem.</li>
    <li> works great. came way before expected date</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Don&#x27;t think about it just buy, think of the money u save by doing ur own nails $$$$$ and you get the same results!!</li>
    <li> The colors of the handle are so cute and creative.  Also, the edges have different sizes that help me put dots almost in all sizes I want! Easier to design my nail arts</li>
    <li> I bought these when I was first getting into nail art. They have been my best tools for months, now, and are an easy clean so they still look like new. The varying sizes of dots and single pointed tip make it much easier to do exacting work. The other end of each of these tools has the same medium-sized dot, too, which is handy when doing a mulicolored style without having to clean up in between layers.</li>
    <li> Quality. Easy to use. Awesome to look at. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> The image gives you the illusion that there are 10 different tips but in reality there are really just 5 different ones. They all have the same size tip on the opposite side. They&#x27;re cheap so there really isn&#x27;t too much to complain or expect.</li>
    <li> Work well for the money. My daughter uses them for her nail designs quite often.</li>
    <li> The product arrived fast and in great condition.  I could not wait to use them &amp;&amp; when I did, I was not disappointed.  Great deal for the price.. Will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Great tools to have if you are into nail art.  They are cheap and do just what they say they will.  It is true that all sizes on one side seem to be all the same, but one time I did a test with all of them using both sides, and the sizes actually do vary quite a bit.  They are not expensive and they work, so buy them.</li>
    <li> I ordered it on nov 2and it&#x27;s dec13 and its still not hear!!!!! I&#x27;m not happy with this experience I&#x27;m upset</li>
    <li> These were at the right price, so I was skeptical about the quality, but they work perfect and I got exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone who&#x27;s a fan of nail art :)</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I am very into nail art and these make some designs so easy to do! They are very easy to use, and clean. I recommend these even for the beginners in the nail art world. They have a great price point, and are worth every penny! I would buy these again if I had a need for another set. I really like that they come with many different sizes in a pack. I am going to buy some of these as gifts for my family.</li>
    <li> Arrived Really Early , Havent Tried Them Yet But , What Could Go Wrong!? Nothing Really , I Love The Way They Look &amp; Feel Cant Wait To Start Doing Some Nail Art With Them. Buying A Set For My Mom Too ! Definitely Would Reccomend!</li>
    <li> Great! I loved them and they are SOOO helpful for designs. I can&#x27;t believe I managed to go without them before! They don&#x27;t break easily, unless you try to break them. My friend grabbed one from my hand by the dotter and ripped it out, but that was her fault. I&#x27;m very satisfied with them :)</li>
    <li> I love these tool I am using them in my art work . You see I am design my own metal curtain&amp; I used these tools to hold the pieces of mirror glass &amp; rhinestone that I am adding on.  Works great . Who new :))</li>
    <li> so these little magical pens are great, I still can&#x27;t do a perfect line with them but they are great for little details and circles.</li>
    <li> I just got these today, about 2 weeks before the estimated Shipping date, and that&#x27;s cool. and these dotting tools are ok but in reality you only get 6 different sizes and not 10. but that&#x27;s ok.. because the one can always use multiples of the standard size dotting tool. makes doing projects with multiple colors that much easier.</li>
    <li> Best detailing tools I have purchased for polymer clay.</li>
    <li> These were ok. They are just like the ones you can get at Michael&#x27;s, but when I started to use them the head of the green one was coming off.</li>
    <li> These are REALLY GOOD but the handle is smaller thatn I expected but other than that its really good.</li>
    <li> Almost all of the tips are the same size. The tips that are different range from unnoticeable to really small. If you want to do designs with any variation in size, this is not the set you are looking for</li>
    <li> Showed up sooner than expected! Beautiful pieces and what a great deal. These retail for $16.95 at pro beauty supplies!! Thank you</li>
    <li> It came super fast. They are smaller than expected abiut half the size of a mormal size pen wothou the cap.  But othet than that super cute and make good dots</li>
    <li> the items were absolutely wonderful they work wonderful and it was delivered in a timely matter very happy with service</li>
    <li> love these dotters they are amazing</li>
    <li> Works great and they hold up well !!!</li>
    <li> The product came fast and was well worth the price. I can easily make cute nail designs with the different sizes.</li>
    <li> Will definitely put them to uses can&#x27;t wait to use them on my family and friends already have people want me to do there nails</li>

    <li> These are very good quality tools.  I was a little disappointed because it did not come with instructions.  I guess I needed more than just the tools.</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use! I have never used dotting tools before, but these are too easy to use. 10 different sizes, so many possibilities!</li>
    <li> this is cool and very cute.im excited to get my nails done for my nail arts with different designed.thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> I Love my dotting tools. The product arrived early and they  work great!  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great deal for these tools. My daughters have made all kinds of cool designs! We are happy with our purchase :)</li>
    <li> only came two days late, the wait wasn&#x27;t long though &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; it got here about in a week or less for me *depends on where you live* GREAT product looks exactly like it does in the photo.  i saw the same ones for a higher price and many people bought those** i got the better deal ^-^ ) super cute, i&#x27;m so happy now i can do cute designs on my nails :) I REALLY recommend this, it&#x27;s an awesome dotting tool!</li>
    <li> my friend had these so i wanted some to being a teen and loving to do my nails well their great all different sizes good for the price</li>
    <li> i received a week after I ordered, so I received it pretty fast and the item was as I expected.  very good.</li>
    <li> Work perfectly. Love the colors. Can do so many deigns with them and are simple to use.</li>
    <li> I love these! I use them so much now. They open up a whole new world of nail art.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect recieved quickly and exactly what I asked for.</li>
    <li> I need more practice on doing my nails. Great deal.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them all yet but I&#x27;m liking the ones that I have so far! I&#x27;ll keep ya posted on it</li>
    <li> I like the design and how it has so many dot sizes, it came between the estimated arrival times, but earlier than i thought. I cant give it a full 5 stars since I have only used it two times and am still getting the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I love painting my nails and creating designs almost everyday. So, these dotting tools make it so easy. Good price. Shipping did not take forever :)</li>
    <li> The price and the product are great, just wish there was a bigger dot one, but they are all great for nail arts</li>
    <li> They work well and we use them twice a week for nail night! Very good buy. Thanks again guys For this item</li>
    <li> These work great, You can use them to make just about any design on your nails. You can just google search for nail art, and you will be instantly able to make them all yourself. No more expensive manicures!</li>
    <li> Not only did the package not arrive but my cc information was stolen right after I purchased this. I do not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> They came before expected and the work really well all different sizes the only downfall is some of them broke :/ but nothing a little nail glue couldn&#x27;t fix ;) lol</li>
    <li> Although this product took a long time to deliver (nearly a month), it came in good condition. Simple, does the job, and is sturdy. My little sister loved this for her nail art collection.</li>
    <li> These tools work well and I love that the varying sizes all have the same small/medium sized dotter on the other side, so that while doing art with varying dot sizes you can work quicker. They&#x27;re obviously not the highest quality tools for how cheap they are, but if properly taken care of they will last. Plus the handle design is a trip :) They came in a flexible plastic case.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter uses these on her polymer clay sculptures.  They work exactly like she needs them to.  Awesome price.</li>
    <li> Great tools. does the job. n very [retty looking.</li>
    <li> Probably the best thing I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon so far. And the fastest to arrive too. It&#x27;s now the only nail tool I use. I love the different sizes and they work very well!</li>
    <li> I ordered the 5pcs 2-ways dotting tools when I found them on sale for $0.01!!!! The shipping was free as well. In all honesty I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since the price was basically free. But to my surprise they look and work great! Most definitely the best penny I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> This are great I love them all</li>
    <li> can do eyes and more n your nails</li>
    <li> Perfect! Both ends work miracles! Luv all the designs on my nails.</li>
    <li> You pay for what you get...for the price I can&#x27;t complain.  One of the sides came loose after first use, but does the job!</li>
    <li> It was fast delivery.  The service was great. The tools were new and In a bag. The tools made it easier to do dots and hearts on my nails. I lo e the colo</li>
    <li> i used it for the first time yesterday, im new to these tools so i have lots to learn on what i can do with them. the tools are pretty sturdy although on one side broke off after my niece sticked it in my nail polish remover bottle smh..</li>
    <li> These are so much better quality than I was expecting for the price I paid.  They came in their own plastic sleeve, the handle is nice and heavy and the metal tips are great.  Some of the tips are the same sizes, but I didn&#x27;t deduct for this because of the unbeleivable value and product quality.  I tried shopping locally for these nail dotting tools, and the only thing available to me was a &amp;#34;nail kit&amp;#34; for almost $7 which contained a lot of things I didn&#x27;t need (another emery board and cuticle tool) and only 1 nail dotting pen, so I chose these even though I didn&#x27;t particularly want to wait, but I&#x27;m glad I did!  After a little practice (on my 3 daughters!)  I did my own nails and when I finished, my sister thought I had paid to have them done.  Best compliment ever.</li>
    <li> Able to do lots of designs with these pins they are light weight and dots are even and do not smear..  would buys these again.</li>
    <li> the only reason why i rated it a four is because i am not able to make straight lines it just wouldn&#x27;t work if anybody have any suggestions i would gladly like to hear ur suggestions thank you</li>
    <li> These nail at pens are amazingly awesome!! I have done polka dots, designs and sooo much more. You get 5 pens, all of which have different sizes of dots ranging from teeny tiny to pretty big-- obviously not bigger than a finger nail though. I am extremely pleased, the product came very well packaged and if I need more-- I will DEFINITELY order this again!! Shipping was extremely fast too!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, tools are great. Good size and is as expected without flaws. 10 / 10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> they were what was expected - nothing great.  It will be fine for my young granddaughter and her friends - quality okay</li>
    <li> It took a while to get these but I was not at all disappointed .  I like the look of them and am in the process of using the and, am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use! easy to clean and store. Great buy at a great price for those interested in doing their own nails!</li>
    <li> These are the Cheapest and Best Item I found while searching for Nail Art tools. Used it on my nails too and does the Job perfectly. The item reached on time. Infact a little earlier, had no issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> These nail dotters worked great and they were a great price. I went to some local beauty supply stores and they wanted $5 for 1. They help to make super cute designs.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these dotting tools yet but, they did arrive soner than I had expected and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Because I have tried them and they worked really well....like perfect dots came out....I would recommended this to other people.</li>
    <li> Loved them :) didn&#x27;t expect them to be do durable and cute cuz of the price but I was very satisfied. I will be buying again from this seller</li>
    <li> These are very easy to use, and seem to be great quality,  some people have complained about some being the same size, and yes, one side is all the same size, and the other are all different, not a big deal though. My daughter and I love these, made a really cute design!</li>
    <li> long wait, but worth it! this exact same pack is like 10-12$ at sallys and I just cant bring myself to spend 12$ on something i only use here and there. I didnt mind the wait because they were soo cheap! good product, just as described.</li>
    <li> The variety in sizes are great, and the tool does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but they are low quality.  After only using them a couple of times, one of them broke at the tip; the plastic part snapped right off.  I took a break from using them for a few months, and when I went to use a different one, again the plastic part snapped right off.  I will be looking for all metal dotting tools moving forward.  I like to do special designs fairly often, so I need a dependable tool.</li>
    <li> I ordered this case thinking i would have big and small dots but their all fairly small, they work pretty good though.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need all these different sizes to make dots, you can make different sizes with one tool, so I gave some of them away.  Great price though.  I wish the other end had different things but they&#x27;re just the same size circles on the other ends.  I&#x27;ve seen them with different design tools on the other end but they probably cost more than these.</li>
    <li> The only thing i didn&#x27;t like about these was that the pink one was snapped in half but thats nothing a little scotch tape cant fix! ;0</li>
    <li> ...the dotting part of the tool, on almost each and every one, on both sides, likes to come off as if the glue wasn&#x27;t applied properly. Nothing a little super glue can&#x27;t fixed, obviously, but it was a tad disappointing when it fell off while dotting. But for the price, you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> Great product! shipping did take a while. But I like it overall I just wish there could be more of a  variety of sizes; one side has the same exact size and the other is the one with sizes big to small</li>
    <li> I love them so much my only problem is the fact that nail polish destroys the beauty of the pen it chaffs it away which is messed up</li>
    <li> I havent tried them yet, but the package arrived in the stimate time and the product is what it is shown in the picture. I guess i will do nice decorations with this.</li>
    <li> these were a great price here and you receive 5 dotting paint pens.  I don&#x27;t really need all 5 so will likely give some to friends.</li>
    <li> these arrived weeks before expected delivery.. Very pleased so far with then.</li>
    <li> I have yet to learn how to use these but I love the color and quality of the product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  My daughter says these were easy to use and had fun being more detailed and articulate with her designs</li>
    <li> They work really well! The only problem I have is the pink one came with one of the sides broken.</li>
    <li> These are helpful for nail cleaning and the care of beautiful nails on both hands and feet.  A real steal of a price.</li>
    <li> They are just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter for Christmas she loves them she does her nails all the time very nice for cheap price I paid</li>
    <li> My 11 year old got these for Christmas and she loves them. Not professional quality but not a professional price either.  They have held up and work great for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly!  Good quality, especially for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> These are amazing. I didn&#x27;t receive any duplicates or broken ones as pervious reviews stated. Can&#x27;t beat the price, when I purchased these I paid a penny, yes a penny! Wit free shipping and it showed up in 5 days, would definitely recently recommend..</li>
    <li> Love these they came 1 week earlier than expected time and they are perfect and have a good grip</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re all different sizes and are so easy to use. I got them two weeks earlier than the estimated delivery date. I was thrilled when I got them early. They are really easy to use, and if you&#x27;re like me and are trying t get better at doing your nails, I suggest buying these.</li>
    <li> Great item! These will last forever.</li>
    <li> I saw these and got excited so I decided to order 2 sets. I got one set for me and one for my Mom.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order by the date quoted but It took about a month to arrive and I only received one of the sets that I ordered. I just hope my second set comes soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dotting tools are alright. Don&#x27;t expect to receive the resealable case that the photos show. The size of dots that the tools create are pretty close to the same size regardless of the size tool you use. I suggest you check out some Youtube videos on how to use them because there are a lot of good tutorials that will help you learn how to make flowers, hearts, and other cool designs. It takes practice to use them correctly but they are fun to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend with caution! You will have to wait a while to receive them and if you order more than one set you may only receive one and have to wait all over for the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck on your decision!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these pens. Definitely the best choice I have made in buying these. I was afraid that for the price they were going to be like super cheap looking and falling apart. They aren&#x27;t super fancy but definitely worth it. They also shipped faster than expected. I have absolutely no complaints. When i got these i used them on myself, on my friend, and her daughter. We all loved the was our nails came out. These are double ended and gives you 10 different sizes. It is kind of a bother trying to figure out which one is the smallest and biggest, but i plan on numbering them to not waste time on figuring out the sizes. I absolutely love these and they are easy to use.</li>
    <li> SO cute, their tiny .. but they get the job done</li>
    <li> I love this product! It comes in different sizes and I got my order before the shipping date. This dotting tools are easy to use. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for dotting tools.</li>
    <li> Nicer than expected,absolutely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this product for making clay charms.  They&#x27;re very helpful in curving clay in different shapes and forms.  I love the spiral designs.</li>
    <li> Decent quality, excellent variety of sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t even tell you how much use I&#x27;ve gotten out of these things.&lt;br /&gt;I 110% recommend you buy these if you have any interest in nail art!</li>
    <li> got them very fast , very cute and super good for there price..very cheap ..great for any nail design .</li>
    <li> Very sturdy. Good quality for the little I paid. It just took some time to get here but i really don&#x27;t mind espcially when it s within the estimated time. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I thought they were great at first but then they started to break</li>
    <li> I had to order these dotting tools 3 separate times before the right ones came to me, but when they did they were exactly what I was looking for. They do what I want and are not cheep looking/feeling. My toddler gets into them (which drives me nuts) and throws them down the stairs and there&#x27;s no sign of them braking. They come in good sizes. The others I received where all smaller heads...still worked great just didn&#x27;t give me as many options. I gave them to my nieces who loved them and we just made a bigger dotting tool with a pin stuck in the eraser of a pencil.</li>
    <li> These work really good</li>
    <li> Thanks, these are all different sizes at both ends unlike the ones I ordered a few years ago. This set was for a gift, so I&#x27;m ordering another for me!!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!! My daughter is going to be very excited. Just as described...Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Received items way earlier then expected.  Excited to use them.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Very cheap!</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 sets of these pens. 2 sets were perfect, however in one set 2 pens were bent. The other sets work perfectly and I was able to fix the 2 bent pens.  Just wish they hadn&#x27;t be shipped like that.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these dotting pencils - easy to use and good quality.</li>
    <li> Great tools for little money !</li>
    <li> Great item.good shipping</li>
    <li> Just as expected!  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and product!  For the money you cant beat it! Very well made and useful. I make custom fondant cakes and this comes in very handy for all those little details that go with custom cakes!</li>
    <li> This was my first nail art tool purchase and it has been really fun to use. This set actually has 10 different dotting tips as there are two tips on each piece. They are easy to hold as they are not too long or too short. The multiple colors are pretty cool looking and make it easy to keep things straight if you use more than one at a time. I paid less than $5 for these and considered it a great buy.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping!!! Great Product!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are super convenient. I love nail art and this makes everything so easy. I&#x27;m ordering another set for my younger cousin so she can have an easier time with nail art as well. So it can also be a great gift!</li>
    <li> I originally planned on ordering these pens for purposes in modeling and sculpting clay. It turns out its just as great for Nail Art. Win. Win.</li>
    <li> She loved them!  Seriously she has been dotting all of her nails and experimenting with the different sizes.  I asked her if she had any complaints with them and she said they are perfect.  The bonus was I got them a week early.</li>
    <li> So cute and they literally have every size of dot. Made of a hard plastic material, won&#x27;t break easily. And the dots hold polish perfectly. Just like what they use in salons!</li>
    <li> I love it, it does seem like there are similar when it comes to the smallest dotting tool but other than that it does the job. I order these to do my 7 year old nails. She had been wanting designs that require dotting tools and I found them for less than 2 cents plus free shipping. Can&#x27;t beat that! Also I got them two days early. I love them!</li>
    <li> My sister wanted this product for her nails. She was very happy when it came in the mail with fast shipping. It is a good product to buy to put decorations in your nails.</li>
    <li> great dotting tools bought them 10-12-13 and still have them in great condition</li>
    <li> I love these tools. I was so excited when I got them in the mail. Only thing was one of the tips fell out so I had to use some super glue to fix it. But other than that I am happy with them. Funny thing was that when they finally arrived I was a little confused because the package said &amp;#34;phone case.&amp;#34; Weird....</li>
    <li> Came fast and everything. Great for clay charms :-)</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter and she loves them!  They are so easy to use and assists with her nail designs.</li>
    <li> Very good I buy 7 pieces and arrives perfect.</li>
    <li> just as it look on the screen. its so cool</li>
    <li> does exactly what it was intended for! each end has a different size ball for endless nail art possibilities. perfect size for gripping anf has a cute pattern. was a little slow in arrival though</li>
    <li> I got all the right pieces and I got them a week early. They also work perfectly when i do nail art</li>
    <li> One of the dotting tools were broken and they were very small and I didn&#x27;t get any brushes. Not very happy</li>
    <li> Very good, happy and satisfied with my purchase, I recommend the product, thank you very much to accomplish. Best regard</li>
    <li> Great item, bought for my niece and she loved them.</li>
    <li> I bought these about 2 months ago. And within the course of 2 more months, was the time of arrival for my product. So unless your impatient, i don&#x27;t recommend buying these! :)</li>
    <li> They are really great! The quality is great, which I was concerned about considering the price but I&#x27;ve had them for about a month now and use them frequently and have had no problems with them. And I really love that they come in different sizes.</li>
    <li> These are just as pictured, so pretty and well made, i would order again. Arrived just as promised. I wish they has a little pouch for storage.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend these! I&#x27;ve used them several times and they work very well! Cheap price, good quality, and fun to use!!</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I use these all the time. You&#x27;ll get your moneys worth great fun colors too. :)</li>
    <li> I would suggest buying higher quality tools if you are a serious nail artist. I would recommend this item for kids or beginners. Not the best dotting tools out there, so look else where for better quality. One of mine actually broke so threes something to think about&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Cheap, don&#x27;t apply accurately on nails&lt;br /&gt;PROS: inexpensive, colorful, comes in a nice variety of sizes</li>
    <li> these work very well they are super easy to use i love them. great for beginners. I would purchase these again!</li>
    <li> Great for creating designs</li>
    <li> This product was one that I could not find easily in the store so I went online. I am so glad I did because it was really cheep I believe I only payed a dollar something when not every in store is that cheap! They are great quality but they lost the star on shipping time. It ships in a month and for a lightweight object that&#x27;s along time! I think it was shipped from a different country, so if you can wait it out I would definatly recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these tools!! While there are work around items you can use to get dots on your nails these tools are really so much better and with the price how could you possibly go wrong? The delivery time was pretty long but it still got here before the estimated delivery window so I can&#x27;t complain. If for some reason you are on the fence about whether or to buy them don&#x27;t wait any longer-get them now! I took forever to make up my mind on them and once I finally did the wait time to get them was brutal. But now I have them and can&#x27;t get over what a difference they have made in my manicures-they add a much more polished look (pun intended lol) than using a bobby pin or toothpick does. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are cute and reliable for simple designs. Not too complicated. I use this mostly for colored dots on the nails.</li>
    <li> So worth the wait! Wasn&#x27;t the least bit disappointed with what I got. Used them minutes after they were delivered &amp; loved them! The cool watercolor design&#x27;s a plus too! ;-)</li>
    <li> It has an amazingly good price, and the variety in sizes is so useful. I work with polymer clay, and I tried these out yesterday! They&#x27;re great quality, and they come in a case.  Just GREAT. :)</li>
    <li> They are great and the best thing is they don&#x27;t cost a lot. Don&#x27;t use too much pressure. I learned it the hard way. You can get different dots and amazing artwork. If you are considering buying it then you should.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time and love that there are so many different sized dots for decorations.  This was an awesome buy for anyone who has fun with nail art!</li>
    <li> I received one that was broken, but I can just glue it back in myself, otherwise, good.</li>
    <li> I love these nailart dotters! Nice quality and looking forward to using on my next nail client~ Thanks so much :)</li>
    <li> I just opened the package and as soon as I did one of the dotter fell out. I taped it back in, but come on I just bought it and its already falling apart. But for the price I guess I can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the quality as well as how fast these came! They said 6-8weeks and I think it was 3 max! For the price I was sure when they arrived I&#x27;d most likely give them to my daughters to use but they are very good quality. Only thing I&#x27;d say is that although you get 5 two-sided ended sticks the sizes aren&#x27;t really that different and it appears you get 5 different size ends. I think I&#x27;ve read that in a review before so poo on me. Overall pretty happy with the purchase...looks like my girls get a set after all :0)</li>
    <li> i love these very useful can do many thing for them not cheep looking! amazing price i will be back!!!</li>
    <li> Came in a good time and was not broken. I can not wait to try and play with this more.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when these finally arrived.  All in tacked nothing loose.  Can&#x27;t wait to start using them!  So excited!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> i didnt like this..... when i ordered it there was two of the same for because the pink was missing? i mean, hello common sense, replace the pink with a different pink, not replace it with a color that is already thre such as white</li>
    <li> I am learning some cute designs with the dotting pens.  I am sure, with a little more practice we can achieve salon quality designs.  Thrilled with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I use these with my clay and for the price, it was fantastic.  I really appreciate the quick delivery time and the pieces have helped immensely in my clay work</li>
    <li> I love the nail art design tips I have only had them for a few weeks and I have already done quite a few cute designs! Comes with many different sizes to create some unique nail art!</li>
    <li> Just as its described in the picture. All the ends are different sizes. They work just for what i needed them for. Such a great purchase for the price!</li>
    <li> Came in early and in perfect condition. Love love love. Doing my daughters nails tonight, we will have lots of fun with these</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved these dotting tools! I use them for almost every nail design and they are so easy to use! They make you create awesome designs so easily! Highly recommended for all those nail art beginners! Theres a really thin one that can be used to make lines if you have the patience I love them! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like but don&#x27;t mind at all was when one of them got nail polish all over it and I tried to clean it with acetone the shininess from it came off but its okay! Does the job right!</li>
    <li> My daughter likes them that she can now try new designs.</li>
    <li> Great price dotting pens. I haven&#x27;t tryed them as of yet but once I purchase some nail paint I will surely get back on this update</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I needed and wanted! I was sooo excited when these came in the mail. They&#x27;re made to be sturdy and are easy to use. 100% exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no complaints! They arrived on time, nothing was broken or damaged, and they paint beautifully. I plan on buying these for my cousins.</li>
    <li> These pens are too cute! They work well and look great! Very pleased! Also they came in a good amount of time!</li>
    <li> Got it for my 12 year old. It takes some practice I guess. Looks easier on You Tube! Would be nice with some instructions.</li>
    <li> I paid less than 1.50 for these so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. they came earlier than expected which is awesome, the quality is pretty good except 2 of the 10 metal parts came loose. it wont be a problem though since I can just put some super glue in the holes to make them stay. Also I don&#x27;t know if my eyes are playing tricks or if the sizes aren&#x27;t that different but it seems like there is only like 6 or 7 different sizes between the 10 dotter heads. I am still pleased regardless. 4 out of 5 since 2 came loose right out of the package</li>
    <li> I like them.  I like making designs on my nails and now my daughter is learning how to do it herself.</li>
    <li> First time getting dotting tools. These are perfect! They make designs so much easier! I am very happy with the tools. They are super stylish too.</li>
    <li> Great quality nail art tools, the carry/storage bag is very helpful.  These make nail art super easy and super fun.</li>
    <li> Just received my dotting tools yesterday and i didnt waste time in using them... they work great havent used them all but ill get there so far there great, easy to handle, easy to clean, none were broke which was a plus, i like the little protective case they come in too.  thank you will purchase from seller again.</li>
    <li> Well organize package and same as picture of the item. It was well cared no damage to the product I brought. Totally new and was ready for use. Thanks you!</li>
    <li> It works great on my nails! i love it so much. i can actually do my nails good now. yay!</li>
    <li> I would of given 5 stars but they took so damn much to arrive. Other than that there great different sizes of dots and durable I&#x27;ve had them for about 4 months now and nothing has gone wrong. They work great everytime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted dotting pens for a while, and was glad to find these for such a good price.  As soon as I got them, I ripped them open and used them - and they work great.  Be advised, there aren&#x27;t actually ten different tips.  There are five pens, and five different tips (each one has a different size on each end, and then a \\&quot;standard\\&quot; size on the other end), but even still, five sizes will get a lot done!</li>
    <li> A little pricey but these work perfect for detailing. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I love my dotting tool pens! They arrived in good condition and have been using them for my polymer clay creations and on my nails and they work beautifully. One of the ends of the dotting tools came loose but just added super glue to it and it works great.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, variety of sizes, and a case? Almost perfect. Almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it would be nice if the sides were angled to prevent them from rolling. But for $2, there&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;very little room to complain!</li>
    <li> Working perfectly. Love them.</li>
    <li> high quality for price. definitely reccomend</li>
    <li> when i bought them i was expecting much because they were only 2$. When I recieved them in the mail i was thrilled at how cute they were. They work great as well.</li>
    <li> Been looking to buy a set of dotting tools, only not so expensive. I use them all the time. Great price for so many dotting tools!</li>
    <li> The first time I used them, they fell apart. You get what you pay for I guess, which wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
    <li> I ordered them valentines day and I haven&#x27;t  got ton them.  I hope they get here soon!!!! I really want to do my nails.</li>
    <li> Two of the pieces fell apart moments after taking them from the packaging. Other than that, they do what they&#x27;re expected to.</li>
    <li> Really inexpensive tools to help with my nail art! I love them and would highly recommend them to anybody who&#x27;s wanting to experiment with designs. Comes with a little pouch to keep the pieces all together and great for traveling, too! Exactly what I wanted :)</li>
    <li> Bought these for my Girlfriend as a mini suprise and wow!!! Quality and Quantity along with the price are outstanding!!! Will definatly buy again but will need to see more product choices. Over all great value and great Product. If you are looking for quality and quantity at an amazing price this is where to go.</li>
    <li> These are great for making dots in nail art, which is what I bought them for. I don&#x27;t know what other purpose I would use them for.</li>
    <li> Great product, shipping takes forever though!</li>
    <li> My favorite set of tools!  They did break after ALOT of use but for the price you can&#x27;t ask for a better set of dotting tools! They also make great Christmas presents/ stocking stuffers!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Yes, I received 5 double-sided dotting tools, but not all are different sizes. All of mine were of very similar size, not the variation of sizes like in the picture.</li>
    <li> 10 tools, but seems like 7 are the same size. Doesn&#x27;t matter...I only use the largest 3 anyway.</li>
    <li> Great deal on these! After seeing so many cute nail art designs on Pinterest, I wanted to try some myself. This was a great kit for the price, and was delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> really nice in this price.</li>
    <li> I Love These Dotting Tools! The Shipping Was Fast! I Ordered It On Saturday And It Came Thursday. Btw It Came In My Mailbox In A Small Cardboard Envelope.

    <li> I got this for the lady who dose my nails,she really likes it. Came on time looks good made well.</li>
    <li> The dotting tool were a little smaller than they appear in the picture. Also they take a while to ship but they work.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, and delivered quickly just wish some tips weren&#x27;t the exact same size. Still does what i needed it to do.</li>
    <li> Product is of poor quality. The peices started falling apart as soon as I took them out of the package.</li>
    <li> Super cute and works great!</li>
    <li> It is an essential for nail art!! Love that this set has two different sizes on each one. They also go from large to small.</li>
    <li> These nail art dotting tools are perfect! So inexpensive, and you get ten different sizes! They are nice quality and feel sturdy. You can create hundreds of cute and creative designs with these tools. Great for children, adults, or anyone who loves nail art! Shipping takes a while, but they are definitely worth the wait.</li>
    <li> One.of. the dotting tools were broken besides that they work.perfectly.fine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these nail dotting tools forever! I went to various stores looking. Then I went on amazon and instantly found them. I looked at different ones and finally decided on this one. They work like magic! Cleaning them is very simple-- just swipe a napkin over them and your done!! They creat perfect dots and are long lasting. They are a bit small in size though-- but are fine for what I need. 5 stars is great!! You should definitely get these.</li>
    <li> I love it! I was worried it would break or not be too good to be true, but it really is great quality! So so happy!</li>
    <li> Great price and great quality! Love these dotting tools! They work perfectly.</li>
    <li> These are so perfect. They vary in size on one end of each of them and the other side are the same size. It is awesome and I love them. I have used them like 4 times and every time just with practice I improve and it is really cool.</li>
    <li> Love these dotting pens ... I use them for my polymer clay charms .... Work great !!!!</li>
    <li> Got here faster then expected. So cheap it was practically free lol Same product other sellers sell for MUCH more! Great for Dotting nail polish or Clay details.</li>
    <li> great for nail art. look just like advertised. big to teeny tiny dot sizes. some are duplicates or so close you cant tell.</li>
    <li> my daughter really likes her dotting tools</li>
    <li> I love this product! Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. They came three weeks early and the price was great.</li>
    <li> They work... I mean... It depends how you use them. It&#x27;s not like they don&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s fine. (11yo daughter review)</li>
    <li> Thank you!!  Quick, easy, and exactly what was promised.</li>
    <li> They work, but each tip is the same size.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Bought for my girlfriend. The dabbers fell apart right out the bag!! Rather not waste my time and money returning these so my girlfriend&#x27;s friend super glued them back. Next time I will look for something sold in America</li>
    <li> Fabulous deal! Came quick &amp; are super cute :) Work great, too.</li>
    <li> My only complaint would be there is not ten different sizes, there are a few that are the exact same size and make the same size dots, and the large dotting tool is actually more of a medium. They are well constructed, and seem to be very durable. Still work great creating flowers, dots, bubbles, etc.</li>
    <li> I love these nail tools!  They are great and come in various sizes! I even put dots on my baby&#x27;s nails it was so much fun!  Quick delivery also.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, good quality for a cheap price</li>
    <li> These were great dotting tools. I love them, Thank you so much for these. They work awesome. Best dotting tools I ever had.</li>
    <li> Wow! For the price they are great. The metal part on one fell off, but super glue fixed it. I use it for my sculptures and they are perfect!</li>
    <li> Great, I get to do so many designs and just play with them. really happy with my purchase, delivery was really fast</li>
    <li> I give it four stars because although its a GREAT product it took forever for it to arrived as in it took two months! I only paid two bucks for it so I was expecting it to arrive in two weeks but it took forever. Overall, I love this product. You can create multiple designs. I love how their five different dotting pens and each have different sizes. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s looking to give their nails a makeover.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to use in my polymer clay pieces. I work with small pieces, and these were perfect for the job.</li>
    <li> use all the time! super cheap too! :)</li>
    <li> Love them! I don&#x27;t use them for nails though...  I use them for Polymer Clay, and they work great! Super cheap for the quality, I still don&#x27;t understand why they were so cheap! $2.08+ free Shipping! The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like is that they took almost 2-3 weeks to ship!!!</li>
    <li> Nice product easy to use would recommend for those who are into nail art. Took a little longer to receive</li>
    <li> Super cute tools, exactly what I needed. Had to wait for a while, but worth the wait! I&#x27;m able to create way more because of these tools!</li>
    <li> Great tool! I love how there are different sizes and they work just great, one of the heads fell off, but it popped back on, otherwise, great product!</li>
    <li> We are very satisfied with this product. You can do many designs for your nails using different colors of nail polish</li>
    <li> they broke but i just put it back together</li>
    <li> I just got my dotting tools in the mail a day early so that is a plus! Overall I like the product! Seems like a great product and the price was not too bad. Only issue I may have is that two of the dotting tools look like the same size but it could just be my eyes playing tricks on me. I know a lot of people who have invested in this product and so far they love it! I agree the product is great!</li>
    <li> I needed some polymer clay tools for my granddaughter and found these through a link on youtube. So glad I did. The tools are beautiful and my granddaughter loves them.</li>
    <li> Overall I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the actual product. They only came with 5 different sizes because each size was duplicated on the other tool. I did like the design of the handle I think it&#x27;s called it was cute and stylish. But again overall they were just too small to make a good design with. Though the seller was nice and reasonable I ended up having to keep them so I was not very impressed!</li>
    <li> I love them! For the price I got them, it&#x27;s a steal. The product is good quality, but the wait was a month long. That&#x27;s expected when they are all the way from Singapore. Worth the wait though!</li>
    <li> The tools I received did not match the picture, my green tool looks nothing like the one in the picture and I did not receive a very large sized one like the green one. I was looking forward to that size and still want/need it. Other than not really getting what the picture showed they work great for the sizes I have, just not enough size variety and no very large one like expected.</li>
    <li> Love to do nail art- so I loved these tools and they were a great price- told my friend to order some</li>
    <li> I really like how they worked and they were easy to work with and easy to clean also nice product</li>
    <li> This product is everything it says it is. The only problem is the wait. It took about 3 weeks to a month. But still definatly worth the money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind spending for this as it was very little but 1 of the tip has already been glued back in</li>
    <li> Took forever to get to me...took so long I forgot I had even ordered it!..Poor quality...guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Nice product, works well ,easy to clean . Come on time.comes in small case so it is easy to store.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my dotting tools. They are small but for my first time using my tools, it was awesome. It shipped fast also.</li>
    <li> Perfect for granddaughter. So inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I got a $1 bill included with my package, so basically I only paid 56 cents for these! One of the tips came out of its socket, but I fixed it with glue. I wish they were labeled so u could tell the difference between tip sizes more easily because they are so tiny. But all in all, this was a real steal of a deal.</li>
    <li> Item was great! Shipping came quick but I&#x27;m not sure if the dots are supposed to be really small. There like the size of the pointy end of a needle. But besides that they work great and it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
    <li> I havent recieved anything at all</li>
    <li> exactly as described not flimsy</li>
    <li> I did not receive the 5pcs 2-ways Acrylic Uv Gel Tools</li>
    <li> needs to be delivered earlier!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for a gift to someone that does nails. They seemed to like them.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the picture and arrived earlier than expected!&lt;br /&gt;I bought these to use when I make polymer clay projects and was looking for a nail art tool a while ago and because there are 10 different sizes I can use them for both things I want!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted, and was a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> What a great deal!  With 2 girls, there will be lots of painted toes and fingers in the future (and I refuse to pay for a professional for a kid).  This allows  you to paint flowers, polka dots, etc.  Color wipes off easily if it hasn&#x27;t dried, and there are a reasonable number of sizes (I wish there was one just a bit bigger)</li>
    <li> Its a great tool when im painting my.nails I love it !</li>
    <li> It took about three weeks for the order to arrive, which was not a problem but all 5 of the pens have the same sized tips on one side meaning I have 5 options for sizing when it should be ten. Seem to be a decent quality, I did have to glue one of the metal cones into the glass, but they serve the purpose I purchased them for.</li>
    <li> Love them! They get the job done!</li>
    <li> Love the color, strong, work great, excellent price.</li>
    <li> They are excellent in working with clay.</li>
    <li> Does what they need too!</li>
    <li> i love this kit, it&#x27;s so cheap and so convenient!</li>
    <li> Came in yesterday and I love em! Great quality!</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools! They came quicker than expected and are exactly as pictured. I could not be happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love these they are quality and add some nice design to my nails easily. I will say that the only reason I would not give 5 stars is because its not all the ends are different. So what you see in the picture is what you get the other end is all the same size and shape so its 6 different sizes total. Other than that I still love them and would recommend them if you are considering purchasing.</li>
    <li> as said. good deal. well priced.</li>
    <li> A must have for nail art enthusiasts. You can create so many fun and unique designs. very east to use!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my granddaughter who loves doing her nails DAILY. She loves these tools ,as they are perfect for her to do designs just like what is done in nail salon. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Great value for the money</li>
    <li> loved them relly cool totally buy them,  i really recommend them.  too cutee and loved the colors . nice making the dotts.</li>
    <li> horrible texture , the dotters barley dot, I would get something else cause this was a waste of money and time!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are really cheap and fun to use. Easy cleanup as well! I might have to get a pair for a girlfriend of mine for her bday!</li>
    <li> True to size n as pictured. Highly recommended for use of bejewling or designing. Good quality for less. It also comes with more sizes depending on the job at hand. Very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> There are everything I wanted, for a great price! I did my nails the day I got them and it made the dots for my design perfectly.</li>
    <li> Even though this took forever to ship, it&#x27;s worth the wait. They do what a dotting tool is suppose to do and they look pretty cool.</li>
    <li> it came sooner than it was suppose to .it comes in a case and  its just like the picture</li>
    <li> Great idea, simple but requires some skill.</li>
    <li> I received them sooner than I thought I would, already used it &amp; there just like the pic they even come in a nice case to hold them in . I love the patterns and the colors. There definitely cute and useful.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!! :)</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter and she has been enjoying making designs with them. A cute little tools for at-home manicures.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these nail art tools because she can design her own nails and not pay the high price at the salon</li>
    <li> Neat little dotting pens for making dots on stuff. I like how there are assorted sizes. Works way better than the toothpick I used to use.</li>
    <li> I received this sooner than expected and am very satisfied with the product, I need to experiment a little more on using them but they are definitely great dotting.tools and have all the sizes you would need.</li>
    <li> AMAZING QUALITY AND AMAZING PRICE! LOVEEEEE THESE! I would buy these again! They work great! I&#x27;m very satisfied!!!!! :) Thank you!</li>
    <li> just got these in the other day, haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them but can say they look just like the picture and can honestly say i didn&#x27;t expect them to look that nice but I like a lot</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter since she started to want to paint her nails. The work wonderfully. They are just as pictured and works well. My daughter and her friends have a blast doing their nails. It was delivered on time too.</li>
    <li> They work okay. I just can&#x27;t ever get them to make the perfect circle. Maybe it&#x27;s just me. I would get these. Very affordable. But don&#x27;t waste you money if your not good at making designs..</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and the product is amazing, loved it. Great for nail designs, the doting sizes are not to different from each other but once you get a hold of the am mount of nail polish you need for each size you will be able to see more difference.</li>
    <li> I got these last week and they&#x27;ve been taunting me from my nail polish box since then.  Last night I gave in and got to work.  I LOVE these.  I did A LOT of dots on all my nails.  My right hand looks just as good as my left.  My daughter was jealous of my cool nails and is now doing her&#x27;s too.</li>
    <li> I still use them and i bout them in 2013. Love them!</li>
    <li> i rated it 3 stars because it takes too long to get shiped to my house and i still didnt get it!</li>
    <li> They took a few weeks to get here, but I am extremely pleased with this purchase. Although 2 of the dotting tools are the same size, I really don&#x27;t mind. For the price, this is an EXTREMELY good value. They seem to be good quality and makes nail art a breeze. Definite investment for any nail polish fanatic!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Seller is nice too.</li>
    <li> daughter in law uses these to do fancy nail decorating on the granddaughters fingers.  I am supergrandma!!!  a good thing to be.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment.......sweettttttttttt I can&#x27;t wait to start using this item now that I have the dotting tools my daughter wants my.</li>

    <li> I love these dotting tools! They are a great price and even come in a nice pouch to keep them in. I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It works okay, I mostly use 1 size. If I could do over, I would order a package of only 1 or 2.</li>
    <li> Shipping came fast. I love the set very nice set doesn&#x27;t feel cheap I&#x27;m very happy with it. I will be buying more for my daughter :)</li>

    <li> I have just gotten into the nail art for me and my girls and we are having so much fun with all the added bling, not to mention all the compliments. these help add the bling and make some of the designs.</li>
    <li> i tried making a dotting tool by using a toothpick. this makes my nail art official and feel like a home professional</li>
    <li> These are so much fun they really are easy to use. I think ill get some for my nieces and even my sisters.</li>
    <li> my daughter  loves this  tools  i got this for her as a birthday gift  would consider buying again  thank you</li>
    <li> I like the product. I have only used it once so I am still no sure how good it is. It makes great dots if you are a beginner :)</li>
    <li> Fabulous!! NOt just for dot painting, but also for embossing. Fantastic price for some very nice tools (8 sizes in all)</li>
    <li> I really like these. They came in all sorts of cool sizes.</li>
    <li> these are perfect. couldn&#x27;t of ask for better quality, especially since it was so cheap</li>
    <li> Love doing my nails and these tools come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;Such a great price too!</li>
    <li> love it  thank you so much</li>
    <li> One of the silver things to make the dotting fell of but I can still put it back on and it stayed but anyways other then that it was really nice , it got here really fast</li>
    <li> These are fun to use. Work great.</li>
    <li> Work exactly as described I&#x27;m satisfied! All I need now is a steady hand!</li>
    <li> these dotting tools work very good, but they came out to be all light pink, even though they work very good i was a little disapointed that they were not colorful</li>
    <li> One of the Pens broke after a few uses. But other than that it is a great product to have!</li>
    <li> It took a while to recieve it but I guess the long wait was worth the price of it.. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love these as well.  They go well with the brushes I have bought.  They help painting designs on nails look much prettier then the brushes.</li>
    <li> I was able to make cute polka dots on my nails and cute little hearts for Valentines Day... My aunt loved it so I got one for her too!</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to handle.  Comfortable to use.  Much nicer than what I had expected.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to make designs freehand on their nails.</li>
    <li> you really need to have a vision of what you want before you start...LOL or you&#x27;ll just have dots everywhere</li>
    <li> I use them every day. Excellent quality. You can&#x27;t beat this deal!!</li>
    <li> I hope to use these to put designs on my nails myself. And these were a perfect price. Arrived faster than I though.</li>
    <li> shipment came on time I bought this product because I wanted to learn how to do designs on toe nails and finger nails. I would consider them to anyone</li>
    <li> Just what I had expected to get and my daughters love them.  Shipping took a long time but from another country I guess it&#x27;s what you have to do.</li>
    <li> My daughter is obsessed with nail art and these tools are the best. She uses them most of the time she paints her nails. Product arrived just as said!</li>
    <li> Love my dotting tool set! Great buy for the price! I was using bobby pins and chop sticks as dotting tools for a while and am so excited to own a real set. They work great and there is a decent variety in sizes.</li>
    <li> At first I was very sceptical about how they were going to look since everyone was complaining about the dots being the same size and some coming bent but mine came in perfect shape! The tools have the same size dot on one side of them and then different sizes on the other side. They are very cute looking and get the job done right! They said it would arrive July 29th and I was upset because I ordered these in mid June, but they arrived wayyy before the deadline! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase(:</li>
    <li> i love it, it came on time, and totally works there isn&#x27;t much else to say, it does exactly what you expect it to</li>
    <li> When I first learned about all the things I could do with nail art these were the first item I bought.  They work well.  There are basically 6 different sized since the bottom is the same size on all of them.  I had the tip fall out of one end but the seller made it right quickly.</li>
    <li> Works as stated fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is sold on online stores for more money, these are what I see all over instagram. These are great! Love them!</li>
    <li> I got them earlier than expected , they worked great at first , but a week later they all started to break, the ends would break off and it was a mess, now I have to go buy a new different set</li>
    <li> Awesome for decorating and I love the style</li>
    <li> i am someone who always has to have my nails painted, and i never had the propper dotting tool to make certain designs. I found these and i thought the price was great, and free shipping!!! They are very easy to use, and have a cool design in them. The only i have a problem with is, i wish some of the dots were bigger and smaller, also one the other side they are pretty much the same size, and there is no need to have five tools the same size</li>
    <li> I love these they are great! instead of buying from any craft store for over 5.99 and more you can get these as less than 2 bucks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used these before decided to give em a try. Love me&#x27; no need to be a genius to know how a perfect circle every time. ;)&lt;br /&gt;I did my first session with hot pink background and black dots with sparkley nail polish in between. Came out perfect.</li>
    <li> Bought for a really good price. The shipment took a while and didn&#x27;t get it until two months after I purchased it but I&#x27;m so glad I did. They work wonderfully</li>
    <li> Shipping arrived early&lt;br /&gt;very inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;quality is amazing&lt;br /&gt;i would invest in this product if you are good at nails!</li>
    <li> I love this . Helps soooo much ! And I&#x27;m not all good at nail art stuff and this made my nail art look absolutely awesome came two days after I orderd it so if you are into nail art and what not . This is for you .</li>
    <li> The nail dotters took a few weeks to get here, I actually forgot that I even ordered but I&#x27;m very glad that I did. I do my nails as often as once a week and I almost use these nail dotters. None of them have broke on me during the past year. I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> I use these for polymer clay.  They work extremely well.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it.  Great Price,  great product.</li>
    <li> Good quality for such a cheap price.</li>
    <li> So mine came a few days before the expected date and when i opened my mailbox i saw a packege and it was the tineset packege so when i opened it it was 5 dotting tools dont expect them to big because there super small</li>
    <li> perfect dotting tools for nail art and applying nail gems to fresh painted nails. nice little set and colorful, looks neat on my makeup area</li>
    <li> I love that there&#x27;s so many dotting sizes.  Easy to clean, easy to handle.  I&#x27;m glad I bought these.  No more toothpicks!</li>
    <li> This product helped me so much in my work. I orderen in November 23th and still like a brand new one. Good quality, everything I wanted</li>
    <li> I got these I&#x27;m the mail today. I haven&#x27;t used them yet. But one of them is rusted! Im not going to return them because of that for the price. It&#x27;s not really a big deal. But other than that they look nice and I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> exactly as described arrived as the seller expected time, great seller, recomended</li>
    <li> These are same quality I found at large beauty products chain......except these were a lot cheaper.  The shipping was super fast and the price was just right.</li>
    <li> This is my first time attempting to use this type of decal tool on the nails. I love them. So easy to use and clean. I love the double tips, saves on space and convenience</li>
    <li> Purchased 10 sets for a Girl Scout event.  Each set has 5 dotters.  Each dotter has two ends.  On one end, each dotter has a different size from very small to larger.Largest is under 2mm.  The other end has the same size dotter on each.  Probably the same as the smallest or second to smallest size.  Bottom line - good set for doing nail art.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received my Oder! I ordered on may 9 and I received it a little over a week later when I was suppose to receive it in the middle of June!! So awesome!! The product is really nice too! It&#x27;s good quality, durable and exactly what I was looking for to do nail art :) good job seller!!! Keep it up!!</li>
    <li> They are easy to work with, easy to clean. I have never used dotting tools before so I have to get used to working with them, but for a first timer like me they are comfortable and easy to grip. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> These have helped me do designs on nails here at home and love it. I highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased when I got them in the mail they are so pretty and come in handy when I&#x27;m doing nails .. Perfect price and fast shipping :--)</li>
    <li> Kinda what i expected for the price... Its nice to have different size dotting tools, i use them for polymer clay projects, not for nails.. So they come in handy having a variety of many different sizes. The quality is normal, there not horribly made, but they arnt spectacular, they are something you could go buy from the market or a beauty supply place and be about the same quality, but for the price, you cant beat this!!! Shipping was rather fast, i actually got it within two weeks, when they said it could take a couple weeks i was like, oh man ima forget i even ordered this, but i was kind of shocked when it came so quickly. Id reccomend it to anyone using it for nails and or crafts. Def worth it!</li>
    <li> I love doing my own nail art and making little flowers and designs. These little dotting tools are so helpful and you can create so many designs with all of the different sized pens!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Great quality. Was not damaged at all. Packaged great... came in a reusable plastic case. Makes PERFECT dots. I also use them to make 5 petal flowers (different sizes :-) ) Would recomend highly!!</li>
    <li> I got them to work with polymer clay, my daughter wants her own now for her nail art, received promptly &amp; at the great price, looks like i&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Worth buying!</li>
    <li> They are very cool :-) would definitely recommend to anyone interested in making dots/art designs</li>
    <li> Took a month to get them but so worth it n.n ive had them for a couple months now !</li>
    <li> I receive this product really fast, and they are just what I wanted</li>
    <li> These came in the mail today and so far I LOVE THEM! I&#x27;ll use them for polymer clay and for my nails. I really love how they look and the sizes of the dotters are PERFECT. Great for nails and clay. For some reason, they were only $0.01 when I ordered them and came with free shipping which is a great price. Now it&#x27;s like $1.98. I was really lucky to buy them at such a low price for these! 👍👌</li>
    <li> I live in Venezuela and I am getting is just the products, everything went well, delivery times were respected and everything is in good condition, greetings, blessings and successes, recommended 100%, thanks.</li>
    <li> great product!! shipped in about a week and was in good condition. only problem was there are actually only 6 different types of dots</li>
    <li> Received merchandise in a timely manner...Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I like the product and they did ship within the allotted time however. it did take some time because of where it is shipping from so keep that in mind. If you can practice patiences for it to ship everything will work out.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Also came much sooner than they estimated.</li>
    <li> It took some time to get use to them but they are very light and easy to use</li>
    <li> Omg there amazing i love them</li>
    <li> Took a little while to get these but other than that they work as expected.</li>
    <li> It came really quick. I love the different sizes they offer. Easy to use for my nail tutorials i watch on youtube.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Was going to be a christmas fift but ended up giving early bc of when it arrived. Decent quality and good buy.</li>
    <li> It came pretty quick. I thought they were going to be bigger thought. They are small yet still good quality.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and the product works very well ... Something fun  to do with your kids</li>
    <li> My lil sis loves it so much useful for her arts and crafts</li>
    <li> I particularly like these small dotting tools. I use them in polymer clay work and they are amazing for making tiny details. Very happy.</li>
    <li> These came in rather quickly,  which is always nice! It was exactly what I ordered, and only one dotting tool had on end that wasn&#x27;t a ball, just a straight end. Considering the price, I definitely won&#x27;t complain!  I actually use the straight end to wipe off stray polish on my cuticles. :)</li>
    <li> I enjoy them look 5 million years to ship. Good quality though !</li>
    <li> great gift for preteen/teen girl that likes to design their own nails</li>
    <li> So excited to have finally received these! Great item. Good quality. Super happy with them!</li>
    <li> It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The most amazing and helpful thing I have ever bought ever, and for super cheap too! All my friends are jealous of my nail art &amp;#34;skill&amp;#34;, which I wouldn&#x27;t have any of if it was not for this product.</li>
    <li> super awesome quality and great price !</li>
    <li> Awesome!! even though it did take time to receive, well worth it!</li>
    <li> Such a good deal for these as I use it when painting my nails ;)</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were a great price - I make jewelry, and these are perfect for texturing and fine detail work.  They are more durable than what some other reviewers seem to be saying, and only two of the tips are the exactly the same, but that&#x27;s fine because they can be back-ups.  I SUPPOSE  I can use them for nail art, too!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This product is great and sturdy it came in brand new with no bends at the tips, it also shipped really fast. recommended if you want to use these because with a dotting tool you can do and practice different designs on your nails will all colors of polishes. even though i have never used dotting tools before these i got tired of using a toothpick because it&#x27;s not the same!!! its easier with these and they are cute too :)</li>
    <li> They are a big help when I do my nails. Thanks. But only 5 are different sizes. All the other ones are they same size.&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen the dotting tools that come in the \\&quot;nail art\\&quot; kits sold at Walgreens and Walmart, etc, and they seem to be of cheaper quality than the ones in this set.  They have a nice weight and are comfortable to use, and they clean up well when you&#x27;re done.  I&#x27;m pretty sure they all have the same size at one end, and the opposite end is different, but how many different sizes do you really need?  One has more of a point than a ball at the end.</li>
    <li> Worked well, came all in one piece. The only thing is that 5x2 is a little misleading because the bottom side of each of these is all the same size, so it&#x27;s really only 6 different sized dots. Still a great product for the price!</li>
    <li> i just whant a dotting tool for my nails and for i could do some cute and easy art nail and some doots</li>
    <li> I figured this would be a handy set for nails and for clay crafts I do. Price was right so I ordered. Nice array of sizes in this set. Was disappointing that the one tip was broken. I can fix it with super glue but shouldn&#x27;t  have to ya know. Not worth the hassle of returning it so I&#x27;ll just be happy with my good deal.</li>
    <li> My daughters have been asking for these tools for months.  They are on a nail decorating frenzy.  Fit the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> I thought they were bigger.</li>
    <li> These are great for doing detail work with polymer clay.  You can grab hold of very tiny pieces and move them without squishing them with the tiny little points on these.  It&#x27;s like having teeny little fingers.  Wonderful for miniature work.</li>
    <li> As I practice, I will get better.  However, the first time around I was able to already have a little fun with my nails.  These are so inexpensive that you&#x27;re not out a whole lot to give it a shot.  I took these with me when we had a &#x27;beauty day&#x27; with my 3rd-4th grade girls and did nails.  They loved the effects we were able to create.</li>
    <li> I bought the dotting tools from this seller, and I have to say that I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I ordered some other items on the same day, and this product was by far the quickest one to get to me! The dotting tools came in perfect condition, and they work wonderfully. The plastic is very sturdy and lightweight, and there&#x27;s a ton of dot sizes to choose from! They&#x27;re perfect for both my nails, and the smaller nails of my younger sister. I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> They are really nice can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
    <li> I use this product for embossing as well as for dotting. Great quality for a reasonable price. Better than expected value for the money</li>
    <li> I use these tools all the time, the set include different sizes what makes them extremely useful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Great item. Some of the sizes seemed to be the same so there isn&#x27;t a hige variety</li>
