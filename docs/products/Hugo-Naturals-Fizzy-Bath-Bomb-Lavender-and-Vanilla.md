      <li>It smells good and makes your skin kinda smooth.</li>
      <li>it bubbled up wonderfully, but left me feeling like I needed another bath.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>If you want a cute bath experience and have silky smooth skin afterwards I encourage these!</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>:)  It also smelled like heaven.  </li>
      <li>The fizz is okay and not what i was hoping.</li>
      <li>I would prefer faster and more fizz</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Lots of fun!!  </li>
      <li>Most Hugo products are fabulous.</li>
      <li>Super awesome, made my skin feel super soft.</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t as strong either.</li>
      <li>Draw a warm to moderately hot bath and then drop this in.</li>
      <li>This was HUGE.  </li>
      <li>Relax enjoy bathe breathe</li>
      <li>It also is a really pretty purple color which was pleasantly surprising because it looked kind of grey in the product picture on my computer.  </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m used to a brand that makes my skin feel silky and clean)  </li>
      <li>It smelled nice, like a very soft herb-y calming smell.</li>
      <li>But the way they make your skin so soft is amazing.</li>
      <li>I love the fizz bath balls so much.  </li>
      <li>Wonder filled fun bubbly bursts.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much science, so this was entertaining for me.</li>
      <li>Loved it, shipped quick and is a lot bigger than I thought.</li>
      <li>Other than that it made my skin super soft and smelt awesome!</li>
      <li>I bathe almost every night in a mixture of Epson salt, Bob&#x27;s Red Mill Baking Soda and this beautiful natural scented Lavender/Vanilla fizz bomb.  </li>
      <li>but if you would rather have less fizz and longer lasting then this might be a good choice for you! &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s because it is more condense than the LUSH brand.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
      <li>For the quality of this product, the price is worth it.</li>
      <li>The smell and price was nice but it took a long time to fizz out.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about its relaxing or skin healing properties, as I was sliding around the tub instead of relaxing, but I did come out smelling good and slightly sparkly.</li>
      <li>overall it was okay.</li>
      <li>This was the first bath bomb I had ever tried.</li>
      <li>Will be getting more off these in the future.</li>
      <li>First off, dropping it in the bath resulted in nothing.  </li>
      <li>I dropped one into a tub after filling it with hot water and it just sat there.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered several bath products from Amazon and this one is just OK.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite products to use in a long hot bath.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product based on positive reviews.</li>
      <li>the bath tub became very slippery, which I thought was funny.</li>
      <li>I have to say that it was pretty fun to play with in the tub, and I&#x27;m an adult (well legally).</li>
      <li>Has a nice smell but it fell apart when I opened it and made a mess on the bathroom floor.</li>
      <li>Got this for my wife and she really enjoys them.</li>
      <li>This is a gift item can really tell you about it.</li>
      <li>I picked these up as part of the subscribe and save plan, so much for that idea.  </li>
      <li>But from having no prior experience of baths and bath related accessories, I liked it.</li>
      <li>Had to order few more.</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous different products and this by far is and will be my favorite for years to come.</li>
      <li>It left my skin soft and the bomb itself is more of a lavender color rather than a grey</li>
      <li>The best part was pulling it out of the water and seeing it foam like crazy then sticking it back in the water</li>
      <li>My skin is also very soft after using this product.  </li>
      <li>the bath bomb is pretty big</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fizz like a LUSH bath bomb but don&#x27;t be fooled by that!</li>
      <li>Try Lush than make your mind up</li>
      <li>Once I have tried a lush bath bombs I will update my review and let you guys know the differences to me.</li>
      <li>I tried these because my wife like the bath bombs from Lush, which are pricey.  </li>
      <li>from a Lush bath bomb.  </li>
      <li>I was using Deep Steep previously, and that product also has several nice fragnances, but it was leaving my skin dry and itchy.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for intense color, go to LUSH, but I never liked too much color because it stains tubs.</li>
      <li>There is no residue left in your tub after use( I have heard that happens with some of the lush ones).</li>
      <li>Overall though, while this is 20-30% cheaper than Lush products, my wife did not like it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t bother, especially if you&#x27;re accustomed to the likes of a LUSH bath bomb.</li>
      <li>Will stick to LUSH for bath bombs in the future.</li>

<li> Second, it did not completely dissolve.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No fizz. No scent. After 30 minutes in the tub about 10% of the bath bomb dissolved. Most Hugo products are fabulous. I use their lotions, soaps and bath salts every day since they are vegan. I purchased this product based on positive reviews. Will stick to LUSH for bath bombs in the future.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products to use in a long hot bath. Soothing essence plus skin softening oils. For the quality of this product, the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> These are awesome..can use like 3 or 4 times also and smell amazing. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> the bath bomb is pretty big and I used it for 2 baths. the scent isn&#x27;t that nice though. overall it was okay.</li>
    <li> I tried these because my wife like the bath bombs from Lush, which are pricey.  This was a little cheaper so I thought I would try them.  They do not compare well.  First off, dropping it in the bath resulted in nothing.  It slowly started to dissolve but there was none of the fizzing, splashing, etc. from a Lush bath bomb.  Second, it did not completely dissolve.  Half of it was sitting in the tub when it was drained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did give off a pleasant smell that translated well to her skin.  Overall though, while this is 20-30% cheaper than Lush products, my wife did not like it.</li>
    <li> Just received the bath bombs today. This will definately help with relaxation with the scent of lavender and vanilla. Draw a warm to moderately hot bath and then drop this in. A must have for your bathing regimine.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Works longer than any bath bomb I&#x27;ve ever seen and it&#x27;s cheaper than almost all of them.</li>
    <li> Fizzy un great scents a staple in my household.  Wonder filled fun bubbly bursts. Good, soothing. Relax enjoy bathe breathe</li>
    <li> I break the ball up and just use chunks at a time per bath.  I bathe almost every night in a mixture of Epson salt, Bob&#x27;s Red Mill Baking Soda and this beautiful natural scented Lavender/Vanilla fizz bomb.  I have tried numerous different products and this by far is and will be my favorite for years to come.</li>
    <li> The lavender vanilla didn&#x27;t smell that great and this brand fails in comparison to Lush products. Try Lush than make your mind up</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. There was no &amp;#34;bomb&amp;#34; like effect in my bathtub.</li>
    <li> This was for my mom she loves bath fizz.  This was HUGE.  :)  :)  It also smelled like heaven.  Lots of fun!!  :)</li>
    <li> I picked these up as part of the subscribe and save plan, so much for that idea.  I dropped one into a tub after filling it with hot water and it just sat there.  No Fizz like other products.  Ten minutes later, when the water was getting cold, it still hadn&#x27;t dissolved and I ended up breaking it up with my hand in order to release any oils it contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much zero fizz compared to other products and the scent that was released when I crushed it wasn&#x27;t as strong either.</li>
    <li> it bubbled up wonderfully, but left me feeling like I needed another bath.  (I&#x27;m used to a brand that makes my skin feel silky and clean)  I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several bath products from Amazon and this one is just OK.  It smells nice and does make some fizz in the bath.  I think it probably lasts longer than the normal bath bomb, but fizzes less.  I would prefer faster and more fizz but if you would rather have less fizz and longer lasting then this might be a good choice for you! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The fizz is okay and not what i was hoping. The color concentration is poor when your in your bath.It smells good and makes your skin kinda smooth.Good product , not what i was expecting</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother, especially if you&#x27;re accustomed to the likes of a LUSH bath bomb. Hardly any fizz or scent AND it made the tub dangerously slippery. I bought some as stocking stuffers for my husband &amp; after one use returned the rest.</li>
    <li> I never had a bath bomb before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I have to say that it was pretty fun to play with in the tub, and I&#x27;m an adult (well legally). But from having no prior experience of baths and bath related accessories, I liked it. It smelled nice, like a very soft herb-y calming smell. It turned the water purple and the bath tub became very slippery, which I thought was funny. The best part was pulling it out of the water and seeing it foam like crazy then sticking it back in the water and it was just a purple ball again. I don&#x27;t know much science, so this was entertaining for me. I don&#x27;t know about its relaxing or skin healing properties, as I was sliding around the tub instead of relaxing, but I did come out smelling good and slightly sparkly.</li>
    <li> Total relaxation and skin rejuvenation - don&#x27;t think twice.  They&#x27;re awesome!!  Great for a gift or for treating yourself!  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the fizz bath balls so much.  I wish I would have ordered more, but they were a little expensive.  But the way they make your skin so soft is amazing.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and she really enjoys them.</li>
    <li> This is Amazing. Smells soon good. Bought it for my Girlfriend and she loved it. Had to order few more.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the lush bath bombs BC they are freaking expensive( hey I&#x27;m in a student budget) so I purchase these &amp; let me just say that all three scents smell amazing! I have a little basket in my restroom on the vanity and I keep all three scents in that basket and when you walk into my restroom that&#x27;s all you smell, it smells so good! As soon as you put it in the tub of water it dissolves and foams and it smells really good. There is no residue left in your tub after use( I have heard that happens with some of the lush ones). Must of the time I cut the bath bombs in half and save the other half for another day. Once I have tried a lush bath bombs I will update my review and let you guys know the differences to me.</li>
    <li> This is a gift item can really tell you about it.</li>
    <li> Super awesome, made my skin feel super soft. Loved it, shipped quick and is a lot bigger than I thought. Still awesome.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t very good, didn&#x27;t dissolve, didn&#x27;t smell nice.</li>
    <li> Hubby likes these too.</li>
    <li> Bought these as gifts for my daughters.  They loved them!!!</li>
    <li> This was the first bath bomb I had ever tried. It does have a really nice scent, but that&#x27;s about all the good I can say for it. There was really very little fizz from it.  Made my own from a youtube video and had much better results!</li>
    <li> I gave this bath bomb as a gift so I cannot attest to it&#x27;s actual use. But it smells SO good; I could smell it from inside the box when I got my package! It also is a really pretty purple color which was pleasantly surprising because it looked kind of grey in the product picture on my computer.  Now I want to get another one for myself!</li>
    <li> Has a nice smell but it fell apart when I opened it and made a mess on the bathroom floor.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fizz like a LUSH bath bomb but don&#x27;t be fooled by that! It&#x27;s a slow fizz but I think it&#x27;s because it is more condense than the LUSH brand. If you&#x27;re looking for intense color, go to LUSH, but I never liked too much color because it stains tubs. If you want a cute bath experience and have silky smooth skin afterwards I encourage these! They are very cheap! All of their fragrances are great :)</li>
    <li> What a relaxing bath and take care of the dry alligator skin just after one use . Will be getting more off these in the future.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t fizz when I dropped it in, and to break it up and dissolve it I had to bust it against the bottom of the tub. Other than that it made my skin super soft and smelt awesome!</li>
    <li> I like it other than the after smell. smells like my stepdad&#x27;s poop. its really big too.</li>
    <li> The smell and price was nice but it took a long time to fizz out. I suggest cutting it in half</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing! It&#x27;s not overwhelming, it&#x27;s very relaxing. It left my skin soft and the bomb itself is more of a lavender color rather than a grey so that&#x27;s a big plus.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Fizzy. Bubble bath bliss</li>
    <li> This is now my very favorite bath product. The smell is very pleasant and not overpowering.  My skin is also very soft after using this product.  I use scissors to cut off portions of the &amp;#34;bath bomb&amp;#34; into the tub, and can usually get at least four baths from one bath bomb.  I was using Deep Steep previously, and that product also has several nice fragnances, but it was leaving my skin dry and itchy.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it!  Great stocking stuffer!</li>
