    <li> It definitely cuts down on irritation but I didn&#x27;t re order.  After my face adjusted to the new razor I really didn&#x27;t need the conditioner.  If your face is sensitive, this works pretty good.</li>

You don&#x27;t need a lot of it, and it keeps the skin from chaffing and getting irritated very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually can&#x27;t use an electric shaver, with this and the new shaver I purchased, it&#x27;s great. No irritation at all.</li>
    <li> I need this for my electric shaver and can not find it in any store in my area.  I have been using this product for years and just love it.</li>

    <li> Thank you. Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;My dad only uses this shaving conditioner.</li>
    <li> This review is not so much about the product as the company and the marketing behind the product.  The product itself is good and does the job as designed.  But, after 4 years it has become too expensive and as a result I have had to give up my beloved \\&quot;Cool Skin\\&quot; razor.  When I first got my razor the Shaving Conditioner (and the replacement heads) were available locally in places like Target, Walgreens, Walmart, etc.  First, after two years the replacement heads disappeared from the shelves (but they were still available on-line at a comparable price).  But last year the Shaving Conditioner disappeared from the shelves.  It couldn&#x27;t be found in any store in my area.  I had been paying just over $6 for it at Walmart.  Now, on-line the price is from 50% to more than 100% higher (plus shipping in most cases).  Even direct from Philips it was out of stock for a time.  This made it just too hard to get AND TOO EXPENSIVE!  It was a great product for an outstanding razor but I have had to lower my expectations with a lesser razor.  If you can afford it, keep buying it but make sure you have enough stock on hand - it isn&#x27;t always available when you need it.  As I said in the begining, it isn&#x27;t the product; but the product support from Philips.</li>
    <li> Just what we ordered.  Thanks  We&#x27;ve had this razor for a couple of years and love this razor, and this shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This product is actually squirted into the razor.  I thought I could squirt it on my hand and apply to face before shaving. Again not reading the description fully before ordering.  I did find a way to use it tho and it works ok.</li>
    <li> Product seem to go old if it sits a long time, but wishing they would make it easier to buy at other locations.</li>
    <li> It works well with my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It may be a little expensive compare to other conditioners on the market, but it is different in terms of the feel after application.</li>
    <li> I truly enjoy Philips Norelco HS800/14 Nivea for Men Anti Irritation Shaving Conditioner system.  The product through Amazon are over $1.00 cheaper than brick-mortar stores</li>
    <li> I have a very tough beard and very sensitive skin.  This is the only electric razor that works for me.  Using Nivea makes so I don&#x27;t even feel the shave and my skin feels great after.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I get a very smooth, comfortable shave using this conditioner in conjunction with my Norelco razor.  I would not use my electric razor without it.</li>
    <li> I own a Philips Norelco water /shower electric shaver and it has the Nivea lotion that makes it so wonderful .</li>
    <li> Tough to find in the stores. I&#x27;m glad to get a quick ship from this vendor. Thanks so much. I</li>
    <li> could not find at any local stores in my home town , just what I needed to use with my shaver !</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Unfortunately Norelco is not making it any more. I will miss being able to use it.</li>
    <li> muchas gracias, compre desde Venezuela sin ningun contratiempo, me llego la mercancia sin ninguna novedad y a tiempo correcto, gracias</li>
    <li> I have used an electric razor for a number of years, but now enjoy it more.  Shaving with lotion is a completely comfortable experience.  Why didn&#x27;t some one think of this concept before?</li>
    <li> this cream is excellent  never had such a close  smooth shave i finish shaving faster without any missed spots  will buy again</li>
    <li> Great product and my husband loves it.  The only drawback is that you have to purchase via sources outside of your local grocery store or pharmacy.  This  makes it difficult to purchase in a quick, efficient and timely fashion.  All who sell the product do not support the refill purchase for the conditioner.  Bad news!  However, the product is excellent.</li>
    <li> Glad that both amazon and Norelco stock this item. I don&#x27;t always use it but when I want a really close shave with the electric shaver it does its job.  So many electric razors do not have this and I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t.</li>
