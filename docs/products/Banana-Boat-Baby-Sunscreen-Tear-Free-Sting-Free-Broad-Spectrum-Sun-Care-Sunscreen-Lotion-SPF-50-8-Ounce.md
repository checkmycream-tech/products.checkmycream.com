      <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT...</li>
      <li>Very happy with this cream.  </li>

      <li>IT&#x60;S THE BEST QUALITY!</li>
      <li>Best baby sunscreen I have found in three years with twins.  </li>
      <li>this one is the best.</li>
      <li>So the best blocks have either titanium or zinc.  </li>
      <li>so it really is great for babies!</li>
      <li>This is the best value sunblock (uses titanium dioxide/zinc oxide rather than chemical sunscreens) I have found.  </li>
      <li>Very good.</li>
      <li>Good stuff and will be using it again this summer!</li>
      <li>I use it on my face &amp; body and my fair skin never gets burned!</li>

      <li>This one works great and lasts quite some time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen works great for my daughter.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is great.  </li>
      <li>Also works well for myself. :P</li>
      <li>I bought it because it gets a good rating from Environmental Working Group.</li>
      <li>But it smells like good.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if it is a good sunscreen since I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>works good.</li>
      <li>good size and good price</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I can recommend this sunscreen to those with babies and want to get out of the house for more than 5 minutes at a time!</li>
      <li>I can wear it close to my eye area where you need the protection the most!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>We love this!</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re aways touching there face!</li>
      <li>It works amazing, I reapply on his face often but he has never gotten burned.</li>
      <li>Also, after much research, I believe the best ingredients are either titanium or zinc, or both.  </li>
      <li>It comes out of the tube fairly runny, but does not spread easily on your skin.</li>
      <li>My favorite sunblock, and&lt;br /&gt;I love the price!</li>
      <li>I wish it was more non-sticky.</li>
      <li>Very rich and creamy and doesn&#x27;t use chemicals.  </li>
      <li>(most sun products available are chemicals that absorb into the skin and change the UV to heat).&lt;br /&gt;-Stays</li>
      <li>It really works good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on easily, without a greasy or stinky smell.  </li>
      <li>Spreads and absorbs easily and no scent</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is perfect for sensitive skin because of the gentle SPF ingredients used, zinc oxide &amp; titanium dioxide.</li>
      <li>Works just fine under makeup.</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>Besides sun protection it keeps my skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>They are so burned and in so much pain!!!</li>
      <li>It smells great (basically, unscented), doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky, and costs less than many competing</li>
      <li>(this is much more cost effective especially in summertime/pooltime)</li>
      <li>I love the fact that, even though it&#x27;s safe to use on my grandbabies, it&#x27;s strong enough to work on me!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really bummed because most sunscreens make my face sting</li>
      <li>We have used it several times on our daughter while outside in the pool, and have been very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>i highly recommend if you are in the water for more than 2 hours at a time, and do not want to use chemical sunscreen.</li>
      <li>As a physician, I&#x27;m already aware that physical blocks are always superior to chemical blocks.</li>
      <li>This is a rather large container which is good because I&#x27;m constantly applying sunscreen on my toddler and running out.  </li>
      <li>This really is tear free.</li>
      <li>Very practical, fast delivery, love it</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, the ingredients are generally safe.  </li>
      <li>I bought it for the zinc oxide sun protection which is better for my sensitive</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s useful.</li>
      <li>:) Works well for my 7 month old.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen works fine for my 28 months old baby-girl, and no allergy occured which mentioned in some comments.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Will send it back for sure-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they did this to be more natural, the only problem is that the new formula doesn&#x27;t protect against sunburn.  </li>
      <li>Usually, going for the \\&quot;baby\\&quot; sunscreen is a fail-safe; if they&#x27;re recommending you  use it on a baby, it better be gentle, water proof, and it better block the sun.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little hard to spread on your skin and rub in, and the smell&#x27;s not the greatest, but it seems to work just fine.</li>
      <li>Although I love how much sunscreen you get for the price, I do not carry this in my diaper bag because it is just too big.  </li>
      <li>because clearly it takes me a while to learn the true value of a product - and every time I have worn it I have come away burned.  </li>
      <li>they are all safe for use on babies 6 months or older (younger if advised by a doctor)</li>
      <li>But it works very well.</li>
      <li>I really like this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have not too much of the sun block smell.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>on much better even when wet (though you should still reapply as directed).&lt;br /&gt;-Begins working immediately since it doesn&#x27;t need to absorb into the skin</li>
      <li>I was going to go with J&amp;J brand sunblock but decided against it since there is so much stuff going on with them putting toxins in their products.  </li>
      <li>Good for sensitive skin, we use on our entire family - young or old.</li>
      <li>not organic, but just as good of a value sunscreen without the high price of organics, and without the toxic component of other lesser grade sunscreens</li>
      <li>However, the low price, large quantity, and natural ingredients made it worth more than the three stars I would have given it for average coverage and a somewhat-hard-to-keep-closed lid.</li>
      <li>If your fancy high end sunblock or suncream does not have the Titanium or zinc, you just waisted money.  </li>
      <li>I use this as a guide to make sure my little one has sunblock on all over and there is no patches missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far, the major flaw for me is that my makeup slides right off when using this.</li>
      <li>love the 50spf and no strong smells</li>
      <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
      <li>with the new formula we got burns both times we used it, even with reapplying.  </li>
      <li>I got a new tube of the sunscreen before going on vacation and could not figure out why we are reacting to it, then I compared the labels.</li>
      <li>Long days on the lake we have to re-apply, but so worth it.</li>
      <li>I reapply frequently and still burn like I put nothing on.  </li>
      <li>Advantages to sunblocks such as these:&lt;br /&gt;-Superior for sensitive skin as they aren&#x27;t absorbed rather stay on the surface and physically reflect the UV away from the skin</li>
      <li>If your child has sensitive skin at all, go with another brand.</li>
      <li>He has sensitive skin and this never gave him problems.</li>
      <li>Considering my experience with this product as an adult, I would never recommend that anyone use it on their baby or child, esp.</li>
      <li>I purchased this use on my face as I have sensitive skin and the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; sunscreen ingredients make me break out.</li>
      <li>so I frequently go through sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I used this on my 1 year old&#x27;s body with no problems.  </li>
      <li>My baby doesnt have a sensitive skin...</li>
      <li>My young daughter remained sun-free at the park with this on, while Mommy got sunburned (Mommy had no sunscreen on).  </li>
      <li>protected my 6 month old (at the time).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A big bottle of about 236ML, enough to use for some time.</li>
    <li> The active ingredients listed on Amazon are not the same as those listed on sunscreen itself.  The tube lists titanium dioxide 3.1% and zinc oxide 4.0%.  So if you are allergic to zinc oxide don&#x27;t buy this.  Don&#x27;t know if it is a good sunscreen since I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Very practical, fast delivery, love it</li>
    <li> love the 50spf and no strong smells</li>
    <li> One of the few &amp;#34;major&amp;#34; brands with oxides for protection and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out! A great value.</li>
    <li> We use this sunscreen for both adults and children (2 and 4 years) in our family. I like that this sunblock is less pasty compare to other zinc or titanium based ones and is not too pasty. You can still see a bit of white and anyone can tell that there is sunblock on. I use this as a guide to make sure my little one has sunblock on all over and there is no patches missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been to beach with this and after almost hours didn&#x27;t get any burn or tan. SO I think it works.&lt;br /&gt;My children say it doesn&#x27;t stink their eyes. We haven&#x27;t had any break outs with this either. We almost always take a shower after we come back home from being outdoors. That might have helped with  breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have not too much of the sun block smell.&lt;br /&gt;Good sized package, Amazon pricing is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients:-&lt;br /&gt;Titanium Dioxide 3.1%&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide 4.0%</li>
    <li> As a physician, I&#x27;m already aware that physical blocks are always superior to chemical blocks. So the best blocks have either titanium or zinc.  If your fancy high end sunblock or suncream does not have the Titanium or zinc, you just waisted money.  My wife and I use this block. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin, we use on our entire family - young or old.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that burns easily, so finding a sunscreen that works without causing irritation is difficult. Usually, going for the \\&quot;baby\\&quot; sunscreen is a fail-safe; if they&#x27;re recommending you  use it on a baby, it better be gentle, water proof, and it better block the sun. However, Bananaboat&#x27;s Baby sunblock did not work for me. At all. I used this on two occasions where I visited the beach in HI. The first time I applied the sunblock twice to dry skin every hour and a half and still got severely burned (pain for 3 days, swelling, headache, fatigue). The next time, figuring I just didn&#x27;t apply it often enough, I applied the sunblock 3 times over a period of 3 hours, once every hour. It was less severe but I still got burned enough to vow never to use this product again. Maybe it would have worked if I stayed out of the water all day, but even when applied to dry skin and letting it soak in for 15-20 minutes before getting it wet, it failed. Considering my experience with this product as an adult, I would never recommend that anyone use it on their baby or child, esp. at the pool or beach.</li>
    <li> I used this on my 1 year old&#x27;s body with no problems.  It was too harsh to use on his face because he broke out.  So I just buy a facial sunscreen to use on his face instead.  My husband &amp; I use this as well with no problems.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen works fine for my 28 months old baby-girl, and no allergy occured which mentioned in some comments. Also works well for myself. :P</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this one very much, it&#x27;s too ropiness, and seems too white which is not easy to use</li>
    <li> We have a 9 month old that has a birth mark on her face that we need to be very careful of in the sun. We apply two or three coats of this sunscreen on her mark (and one coat everywhere else) and have seen no sunburn anytime we have gone outside. We usually spend 30-45 minutes walking to and spending time at the park, so that is more than enough time to actually get a burn. Therefore, I can recommend this sunscreen to those with babies and want to get out of the house for more than 5 minutes at a time!</li>
    <li> To thick hard to rub in</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen.  Very rich and creamy and doesn&#x27;t use chemicals.  Besides sun protection it keeps my skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I bought it for the zinc oxide sun protection which is better for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily, without a greasy or stinky smell.  there&#x27;s really no notable fragrance to this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good.It&#x27;s useful.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve changed formula and added zinc oxide that causes allergy in my baby and me. This was the only sunblock that did not cause rash and hives! They don&#x27;t show the change on the amazon, but look at the picture of the tube - ingredients are different from the ones listed on amazon. I got a new tube of the sunscreen before going on vacation and could not figure out why we are reacting to it, then I compared the labels. I am so frustrated.</li>
    <li> I believe it was expired when delivered. (Although you could see where the expiration sticker had been taken off). My son got burnt 15 min after being in the sun.</li>
    <li> I was going to go with J&amp;J brand sunblock but decided against it since there is so much stuff going on with them putting toxins in their products.  So I decided to try this brand.  It&#x27;s great.  It&#x27;s about twice as much for just a tad bit less and works!  Plus it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I am an adult with sensitive skin and this is the only &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; sunscreen that has worked for me.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This really is tear free. I can wear it close to my eye area where you need the protection the most!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately even waiting the 15 minutes after application and reapplying every hour, sunburn is still an issue.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I can use on my face and my 4 year old.  It works amazing, I reapply on his face often but he has never gotten burned.</li>
    <li> This is the best value sunblock (uses titanium dioxide/zinc oxide rather than chemical sunscreens) I have found.  As far as I can tell, the ingredients are generally safe.  Advantages to sunblocks such as these:&lt;br /&gt;-Superior for sensitive skin as they aren&#x27;t absorbed rather stay on the surface and physically reflect the UV away from the skin (most sun products available are chemicals that absorb into the skin and change the UV to heat).&lt;br /&gt;-Stays on much better even when wet (though you should still reapply as directed).&lt;br /&gt;-Begins working immediately since it doesn&#x27;t need to absorb into the skin first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;-Takes longer to apply and more difficult to rub into skin so it&#x27;s not visible&lt;br /&gt;-More difficult to remove (you may have to use soap and scrub a little)&lt;br /&gt;-If you become wet it may be slightly visible giving you a white/pink appearance&lt;br /&gt;-More expensive than chemical sunscreens&lt;br /&gt;-Applying when you&#x27;re already wet or sweaty will make you look like a melting white mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips-&lt;br /&gt;-For easier application apply before sweating&lt;br /&gt;-Scrub facial hair with a towel after application to remove white residue&lt;br /&gt;-Lightly &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34; with a towel after application to remove excess and minimize the &amp;#34;white look&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-The Banana Boat Kids, Baby, and standard sunblock have the same active ingredients in the same concentration and the inactive ones are in the same order, suggesting the products are all the same just different packaging/marketing.  Buy whichever is cheapest they are all safe for use on babies 6 months or older (younger if advised by a doctor)</li>
    <li> We love this! Other reviews might say it goes on and looks white, but if you RUB it in then no problem!! ;)</li>
    <li> One bottle among the four lotions I bought spilled. The lid just run off the body of the lotion. .</li>
    <li> OMG... this is horrible!!!! My baby doesnt have a sensitive skin... but when I put this on her face... OMG she broke out so much, received the worst rash I have ever seen! How is this possible and what in the world is in this thing... shouldnt this be sensitive towards a babys skin? What toxins are in there? Horrible. I felt so bad for my baby. Will send it back for sure- the company should definitley look into this...this shouldnt be happening. Will not purchase and not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I think it has some greasy</li>
    <li> good size and good price</li>
    <li> When I first had my baby, I purchased some very expensive all natrual sunscreen.  The bottle was tiny.  We live in California, so sunscreen is required almost all year round.  This sunscreen is great.  The bottle is very large, sunscreen is thick and unscented, and my baby has never had any type of reaction to it.  We use this sunscreen almost everyday.  Although I love how much sunscreen you get for the price, I do not carry this in my diaper bag because it is just too big.  I have smaller bottle that I use for travel.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat buyer of this product. Be prepared to spend a little bit of extra time rubbing it in, as it tends to leave white smears. I am giving this 4 stars, as one of my three children did end up with a little bit of red on their neck after less than 15 minutes outside. I paid extra attention to that area, and the product was carefully applied.</li>
    <li> She doesn&#x27;t get irritated by this and doesn&#x27;t even get pink. Remember to rub head down in case they pull their hat off to protect scalp. I offered mine up to help another.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly on my red headed child.  She burns even with some other sunscreens.  This one works great and lasts quite some time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this use on my face as I have sensitive skin and the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; sunscreen ingredients make me break out. The sunscreen in this is Titanium dioxide 3.1% and Zinc Oxide 4.0%. Since it is still winter, I don&#x27;t know how well it works as a sunscreen under the summer sun or how well it will stay on if you sweat. It is greasy, but all sunscreen is. It comes out of the tube fairly runny, but does not spread easily on your skin. So far, the major flaw for me is that my makeup slides right off when using this. By lunch time it looks as if I never applied any at all.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that Banana Boat still uses a physical sunblock in their baby formula. This and Nuetrogena where the only two products I could find. (this is much more cost effective especially in summertime/pooltime)</li>
    <li> works good. protected my 6 month old (at the time).</li>
    <li> Works great and does not irritate my toddler&#x27;s eyes.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT... IT&#x60;S THE BEST QUALITY!</li>
    <li> We have used this for years to avoid sunburns.  Long days on the lake we have to re-apply, but so worth it.</li>
    <li> Use this daily on our 4yo. He has sensitive skin and this never gave him problems. We buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> This did not rub into my daughter&#x27;s skin at all.  It then gets all over her clothes and on her hands and then into her eyes!  Do yourself a favor and skip this!</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended this and it has worked well.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works great for my daughter. I&#x27;m quite happy with the results and the quality. No skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Havn&#x27;t used it yet. But it smells like good.</li>
    <li> Product was what I expected. Good price. Big tube :) Works well for my 7 month old. Doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell or anything</li>
    <li> Make your face look like white ghost !</li>
    <li> The dermatologist told me that the best sunscreens are cream, and not oil.  Also, after much research, I believe the best ingredients are either titanium or zinc, or both.  This cream has titanium, and not some of the other less desirable ingredients  that  the other products have.  Very happy with this cream.  You almost have to get the baby sunscreen to get the ingredients you want.</li>
    <li> Best baby sunscreen I have found in three years with twins.  No sting, stays on well, soaks in well (not greasy or white.)</li>
    <li> I bought it because it gets a good rating from Environmental Working Group. It&#x27;s a little hard to spread on your skin and rub in, and the smell&#x27;s not the greatest, but it seems to work just fine.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve changed the formula;  the active ingredients used to include 4 types of sun protection and now only include titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.  I&#x27;m sure they did this to be more natural, the only problem is that the new formula doesn&#x27;t protect against sunburn.  I have used this since my daughter was a baby and we have never gotten a burn;  with the new formula we got burns both times we used it, even with reapplying.  I&#x27;m really bummed because most sunscreens make my face sting and this is one of the only ones that didn&#x27;t, and worked... but not anymore. :(</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is perfect for sensitive skin because of the gentle SPF ingredients used, zinc oxide &amp; titanium dioxide. I use it on my face &amp; body and my fair skin never gets burned!</li>
    <li> I wish it was more non-sticky. I like it overall</li>
    <li> This gave my daughter a horrible skin rash on her face, necks and arms.  If your child has sensitive skin at all, go with another brand.</li>
    <li> Thick sunscreen, no stinging or burning, stays on well even in damp or wet conditions. My go-to choice. I don&#x27;t wear this under makeup, though, it&#x27;s best for working or playing outdoors. Will make skin somewhat white, even when rubbed in really well, unless you only use a tiny amount. I don&#x27;t mind though.</li>
    <li> My young daughter remained sun-free at the park with this on, while Mommy got sunburned (Mommy had no sunscreen on).  So I know it works.</li>
    <li> We surf and are outdoors a lot. We&#x27;ve tried about a dozen &#x27;natural&#x27; or chemical free sunscreens and very few of them last in the water. this one is the best. i highly recommend if you are in the water for more than 2 hours at a time, and do not want to use chemical sunscreen. I believe this one is zinc, which is a physical sunblock</li>
    <li> we received it in time for our vacation. package wasn&#x27;t damaged (actually came in a box).  Next summer, we will buy this again!</li>
    <li> My wife and I purchased this for our daughter, after reviewing several sunblocks.  Our pediatrician told us to find one that had minimal ingredients, specifically  &amp;#34;Titanium Dioxide&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Zinc Oxide&amp;#34;.  When I saw the label this had just those two items, I purchased it.  We have used it several times on our daughter while outside in the pool, and have been very happy with it.  It seems to hold even in water, and she has not been burned once yet.  I like the minimal ingredients and that they matched the specific ones our Pediatrician told us to find.  All in all, can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t contain parabens or oxybenzone. The sunscreen ingredients are mineral based so it means that it goes on white and you have to work to rub it in. But it works very well. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with burning for myself or my daughter after spending 4 hours at the beach. I would recommend it if you are looking for an affordable sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t contain parabens or oxybenzone, and that works well.</li>
    <li> Not too thick or thin. Spreads and absorbs easily and no scent so it really is great for babies!</li>
    <li> I used this on my son all last summer (who was around 1 yrs old at the time). It really works good. We went on vacation last summer and with this on, he didn&#x27;t get burnt or even any sun while the rest of us did!! We were on the beach a lot all week and this worked wonders for him! And it didn&#x27;t seem to burn his eyes or make them red, and with a 1yr old they&#x27;re aways touching there face! Good stuff and will be using it again this summer!</li>
    <li> Unbelievably terrible sunscreen.  I live in Hawaii so I frequently go through sunscreen.  This is without a doubt the worst sunscreen I have used.  Heck, even the bottle looks sunburned.  I have gone through the entire tub - because clearly it takes me a while to learn the true value of a product - and every time I have worn it I have come away burned.  And it&#x27;s not like I am putting it on, and then sitting in the sun for 18 hours.  I reapply frequently and still burn like I put nothing on.  Rather than buying this product, I recommend you go to the grocery store, buy a tub of crisco, and marinate your skin in that before hitting in the sun.  How this is considered a product for those with the most vulnerable skin - babies - is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this one star because I think I have to give it at least one star for it to register on the site and because banana boat deserves at least a star for the gall of releasing a product this contrary to what it is advertised as.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product if you want skin protection.  Do buy this product if you hate your children and think it&#x27;s time for them to learn a lesson on the power of the sun.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t put this sunscreen on my dog!!!! We went to the beach today and my aunt bought this for my little cousin and brother and everywhere they put the sunscreen they got burned! They are so burned and in so much pain!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite sunblock, and&lt;br /&gt;I love the price!</li>
    <li> not organic, but just as good of a value sunscreen without the high price of organics, and without the toxic component of other lesser grade sunscreens</li>
    <li> I love the fact that, even though it&#x27;s safe to use on my grandbabies, it&#x27;s strong enough to work on me! It smells great (basically, unscented), doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky, and costs less than many competing brands.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit harder to rub in, than some brands, but I don&#x27;t mind that when I&#x27;m just using it at home. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with burning or wear-off, that others describe, but I do reapply VERY often, observe expiration dates carefully, and take other preventive measures (like long-sleeved shirts and brimmed hats), when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the difficulty in blending, I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. However, the low price, large quantity, and natural ingredients made it worth more than the three stars I would have given it for average coverage and a somewhat-hard-to-keep-closed lid. While I do prefer other brands for other uses, I do like this for my daily &amp;#34;at-home&amp;#34; go-to product.</li>
    <li> Like it. However, it hardens too soon as 3 seconds when you put it on hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Works just fine under makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a rather large container which is good because I&#x27;m constantly applying sunscreen on my toddler and running out.  He doesn&#x27;t get burned wherever I apply it so I know it&#x27;s working but wish it blended in easier.  The sunscreen is always visible on his skin and he looks like he&#x27;s coated in white paint.</li>
