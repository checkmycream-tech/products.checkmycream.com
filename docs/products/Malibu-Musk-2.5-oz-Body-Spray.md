    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years and now it&#x27;s being discontinued. I&#x27;m looking for input from anyone that knows of a fragrance that comes close to the malibu musk scent. I&#x27;m very disappointed that I won&#x27;t be able to purchase the Malibu Musk anymore. The best clean fresh scent ever, even after wearing it all day.</li>
    <li> I must have received a bad batch of perfume, because it doesn&#x27;t smell right.  I always order through Amazon and have never had any issues.  This time the perfume just didn&#x27;t smell like it should.  I  usually order between 4 and 6 bottles at a time, which lasts me 4 to 8 weeks.  I am disappointed...</li>
    <li> The smell takes me back to high school. Light and fresh.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this and can&#x27;t figure out why they ever stopped making it.</li>

    <li> Great!  glad you had this item, since Walgreens ran out of it.  thank you..  DMR</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walgreen last year... And I fell in love with this body spray. But I could not find it anywhere again after I used up my last can. I just placed an order on amazon. Let&#x27;s see if I get the original or a some fake kind...fingers crossed. It&#x27;s a very beautiful and long lasting smell...</li>
    <li> Great scent a little lighter than I remember but very nice. Smells like a subtle pineapple and a warm day on the beach. The only thing that comes close is Aqua di gio.&lt;br /&gt;shipped very very quickly, great seller ( malibu lover )</li>
    <li> My 35yo daughter&#x27;s favorite back when she was in her teens, LAUGHED and still LOVES it when I sent it to her!</li>
    <li> Love this spray if only the price will go down, I remember back in the 90&#x27;s  buying several of these small ones for a dollar each, well, I love the fragrance and this how much it cost now.</li>
    <li> I cant find this in the stores anymore so it was nice to be-able to get this product. The only thing that I was not really satisfied about was the cost of shipping so I most likely wont be ordering this again. The cost of the product was reasonable even though the cans are smaller and the same price as the bigger ones,but I can deal with that. But shipping cost way to much</li>
    <li> Was happy to find it again. I used to wear this and always received compliments. It is a clean,  fresh scent. Kind of perfect for Spring and Summer.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles for my friend and I.  Brought me right back to my youth...  Smells the way it did in the 90s :)</li>
