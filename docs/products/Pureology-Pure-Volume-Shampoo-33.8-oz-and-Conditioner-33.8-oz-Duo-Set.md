      <li>If you want the silky feel than many woman see on the hair models in magazines and comercials, than maybe his is not your product.  </li>
      <li>My wife and daughters love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>probably more.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent too.</li>
      <li>I love pureology.</li>

      <li>It feels like it&#x27;s more water downed.</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have never had that happen with authentic Pureology products.</li>
      <li>The softer and shinier my hair gets from products, the more I lose my styling abililty.  </li>
      <li>It did make my hair have more volume</li>
      <li>Made by the company that developed the original Pureology, this stuff is awesome.</li>
      <li>First, I have to say that I have used this product before and loved it.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair clean and shiny!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, good service, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I am a thrifty gal at heart, but if something is really that superior, I thought I had to try it..</li>
      <li>I even did the little test on the product website to find out which product is best for my hair type, and made sure I bought the &amp;#34;extra care&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>So I bought this huge bulk quantity size, after seeing the great deal this company offers for these products.  </li>
      <li>and I ran out of my favorite shampoo and conditioner, didn&#x27;t know where to find it locally so got on line and found it for a great price.  </li>
      <li>I am not losing my hair, but I have baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I picked Volume Purelogy because I have baby fine hair and wanted it to look fuller, yet what I needed was hydration because I had color treated hair with highlights.</li>
      <li>It came quickly, wrapped well and even had a hand written note with an emory board included!</li>
      <li>Gives my hair alot of volume and super shiny and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>I buy shampoo &amp; conditioner from the beauty supply store, the huge bottles sell for over $60.00 each.  </li>
      <li>I am a HUGE fan of pureology products.  </li>
      <li>you are looking for cheap, this is not your brand.</li>
      <li>Yes, I do notice that there seems to be a light coating on my hair once I used the volume shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Why would they ruin such a great product?</li>
      <li>Exact same product at a spectacular price!!</li>
      <li>The conditioner does not have as strong of a smell but neither one has a nice smell as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazon, please do not let this seller list reviews for the original product.  </li>
      <li>My hair is super baby fine</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t happen with their original volumizing formula.</li>
      <li>do you really have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t respond to most volumizing poducts?  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Old stock. I sent it back</li>
    <li> I did not think there was a difference in shampoos, except WEN, which I do not consider a shampoo, but this product shows silky hair from the first treatment. I had dryed out, dyed out hair and thought there was nothing but deep conditioning in my future- this product makes my hair shinny and silky without the ten minute conditioners - highly recommended for anyone&#x27;s hair, in any condition.</li>
    <li> Made my hair knot up and feel like the product being sold as Pureology from this seller was not the same product that I had from the salon purchased bottle. Is it a fake? I would like my money back to be totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> My daughter said it fits her hair. Be careful it may not fit others. If want buy it, then try first.</li>
    <li> It is my belief that the product that comes in these bottles IS NOT PUREOLOGY.  I have used it for years, and this acts nothing like it.  Pureology only takes about a nickle-sized amount to lather up; this takes a TON.  Then after using it only a couple of times, my hair looked dry and frizzy and I&#x27;d just had it cut.  It does not even smell the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased from a different seller in past and that was okay.  From now on though, due to this instance, I do not think I will try to buy this type of product on-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Amazon is allowing me to return this for a refund - THANK YOU AMAZON!</li>
    <li> Preserves color and smells wonderful.  Pricey, but you only use a small amount and it lasts a very long time - months.  Best value this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo &amp; Conditioner for my hair!  I am always thrilled to be able to get the best deal on pricing for the real product on Amazon!  It will take me about a year to use the entire 33.8 oz shampoo and about a year and a half to use the entire 33.8 oz conditioner, both of which make the price an awesome deal for superior products!</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo, but very heavy on the hair. Even thin hair will feel weighed down.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of pureology products.  I switched from Pureology to Matrix when I ran of out product but quickly switched back when my hair felt greasy and heavy.  I purchased the liters and transfered the product to travel sized containers to take up less space in my shower.      I can go 2-3 days without washing my hair when I use the shampoo.  I could probably get away with 4 days if I curled my hair and brushed it out each day.  It has a great smell to it and makes your hair feel so clean.  It&#x27;s great to use in the winter when your hair scalp feels dry too.</li>
    <li> Pureology PureVolume not only smells awesome but I love how it makes my hair feel.  If you are looking for something lightweight I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This shampoo formula has been changed and not as good as it used to be.</li>
    <li> I again purchased this for my mother, this is her favorite Shampoo!!  I used to sell PureOlogy before they sold it to Loreal...It wonderful to buy the 33 oz. for my mom with the pump...it will last her for a Loooong time!! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and purchase the larger bottles 33.8oz. I am extremely disappointed as their formula has changed. I cannot comb through my hair after it is washed. I have to use a seperate detangler. This didn&#x27;t happen with their original volumizing formula. My hair feels dry and brittle. If you are use to the old formula, DO NOT buy the new one! You&#x27;ll regret it. I encourage anyone who uses this new formula to send an email to the company to voice your concerns. I did!</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when I used this \\&quot;new formula\\&quot; version of Pureology (as states on the bottle)... I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and it has been the best by far... But this new version leaves my hair feeling like straw.. It&#x27;s awful! It&#x27;s back to the drawing board to find a new shampoo/conditioner ... I&#x27;m not happy at all!</li>
    <li> I had been using this for at least 4 years. The FIRST time I used it I felt such a significant and positive change to my hair, I was hooked. I had NEVER had such a dramatic experience with a hair product in my life - my hair actually came out feeling like &amp;#34;salon hair&amp;#34; at home. It was soft, shiny and felt so healthy. I have recommended the Pureology brand many times over that time, particularly since I have always had long hair that people routinely compliment.  I buy shampoo &amp; conditioner from the beauty supply store, the huge bottles sell for over $60.00 each.  They would last me almost a year even with long hair. The last bottle I bought had a little sticker on it that said &amp;#34;New Formula for More Volume&amp;#34;.  Having established confidence in Pureology over the years, I had no concern.  I purchased the bottle of &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34; shampoo in plenty of time before I ran out with the old bottle. When I finally got to using it, it immediately (and shockingly) made my hair feel like DRY STRAW while I was lathering up and my hair is now horribly frizzy and unmanageable when  it dries. No more compliments, as I have become a walking advertisement for &amp;#34;what not to use&amp;#34; for your hair.  Well, there is only a 30 day return policy and since I went over that waiting for my previous bottle to finish, I became stuck with this expensive bottle of garbage. SUCH A WASTE.  I thought I may have gotten a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34; , but seeing the reviews, I can see it isn&#x27;t just a bad batch because they have destroyed what used to be a good product.  I don&#x27;t know why they diminished the quality of this product so badly. I won&#x27;t be using it ever again. BYE-BYE Pureology!  03/14/15 Since I wrote this, I heard that another company had purchased Pureology just before my horrid experience.  Apparently the new company has changed the formula.  Such a shame to destroy such a good product.</li>
    <li> My salon closed a while back and I ran out of my favorite shampoo and conditioner, didn&#x27;t know where to find it locally so got on line and found it for a great price.  It came quickly, wrapped well and even had a hand written note with an emory board included!</li>
    <li> I love Pureology and I loved being able to by it in bulk and save myself some money. I will order it again if they have it.</li>
    <li> This product is good, but I feel for the money you can get cheaper alternatives that work just as well.  Pantene is one of them.</li>
    <li> I am updating my review from a 5-star to a 1-star today because I recently found out that the Pureology brand was bought by L&#x27;Oreal, a cosmetic company infamous for their refusal to stop cruel and needless animal testing on their products.  This is probably why they changed (updated) their packaging last winter.  The old packaging was labled VEGAN and the new containers have dropped that.  Now I ask you, why would a company buy a perfectly wonderful 5-star brand and then change it for the worst?  To 1) kill the competition, or 2) reduce overheard to increase profit margin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks  alot,  L&#x27;Oreal, for ruining the best hair products I ever used. But I&#x27;ve found your replacement- Color Proof!  Made by the company that developed the original Pureology, this stuff is awesome. Even more pricey than Pureology is the only draw back. On the plus side, it sets a new standard in hair care AND its VEGAN and CRUELTY-FREE.  And I found it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for cheap, this is not your brand. But if you want the best product for color-treated hair at the best price I have found anywhere, you will love it.  No weird chemicals, no animal testing, makes hair beautiful and great-smelling. Protects color even in south Florida sun.  I especially like the mega-size with the pump.</li>
    <li> I have looked for great shampoos and conditioners all my life and this by far is the best.  I am skeptical about paying so much money, but for Pureology it is all worth it to me.  I barely have to use any to get my whole head lathered and the conditioner feels like nothing, yet my hair is always tangle free afterward.  I was hesitant to spend $100 on 2 bottles, but I would bet the bottles last me at least a year, probably more.  I&#x27;ve bought samples that aren&#x27;t as big as my hand for almost $10/ea. My one concern is about the conditioner though...I&#x27;ve used a sample and the color and smell seems a bit different from what is inside the big bottle and although the big bottle works well, I feel the product inside the sample was better. The sample and the big bottles are the exact same product...who knows. thumbs up from me!</li>
    <li> came on time, I was surprized a bottle of this size didn&#x27;t include a pump.   so if you order this hope you have a pump. wish the pricing was lower</li>
    <li> Liked the shampoo and it did give volume, yet my hair felt dry after using it. I needed a shampoo/conditioner that hydrated. I picked Volume Purelogy because I have baby fine hair and wanted it to look fuller, yet what I needed was hydration because I had color treated hair with highlights. It did look fuller with the Volume Purelogy.</li>
    <li> Some people are blessed with thick and wavy hair, whereas others, like me, have fine and lifeless hair.  This product gives my hair the look and feel of a lot more volume, so what more could I expect!  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosalie</li>
    <li> I have read many negative reviews for the pure volume shampoo and conditioner.  Some say they cannot comb through their hair, their hair is like straw, etc. etc.  I ask those shoppers...do you really have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t respond to most volumizing poducts?  I am not losing my hair, but I have baby fine hair.  The softer and shinier my hair gets from products, the more I lose my styling abililty.  Soft, shiny hair, on me, is flat and does nothing for me as a &amp;#34;crowing glory&amp;#34;.  Yes, I do notice that there seems to be a light coating on my hair once I used the volume shampoo and conditioner.  But it is so worth the final result.  My hair finally looks full and stylish.  My best friend asked me if I had hair extensions added to my hair since it looks so much fuller than it usually does.  If you want the silky feel than many woman see on the hair models in magazines and comercials, than maybe his is not your product.  After all, if your hair is that thick and luscious, you have no worries; you can get more volume with a good brush, dryer or rollers.  I cannot.  So I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for at least two years now... I absolutely love it! I was reluctant to try pureology because of its price... It is worth every penny! It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair after using it for awhile (I&#x27;ve been using it for over two years) and it doesn&#x27;t fade my hair color. Could not speak more highly of a shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> This is not the true Pureology you buy in the salon.  It left my hair feeling like straw!  I am so mad I was duped into paying $88 for this.  I will be filing a complaint with Amazon and my credit card. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this works great. A very&lt;br /&gt;clean and crisp smell.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was sooner vs. later and handled efficiently and professionally.</li>
    <li> These are horrible, cheap, fake products that damaged my hair. I usually buy direct from the salon and thought I could easily have these shipped. WRONG!!! The shampoo competent stripped my hair and the conditioner is just as bad.&lt;br /&gt;I  am returning the items and expect a full refund. Selling fake or watered down products is offensive and wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I would give less than one star if I could.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Gives my hair alot of volume and super shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Love LOVE Love Purology  but have a difficult time finding it at Salons...Thank you for selling it on line!!!!!</li>
    <li> The squirter did not work and the bottle leaks. Wasted quite a bit by leakage. Would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> After major surgery two days in a row, my hair was in very bad shape and it was recommended I use Pureology PureVolume Shampoo and Conditioner.  My hair is completely back to normal after using this for two months.</li>
    <li> The product is what is to be expected as a fine shampoo and conditioner. It took three weeks and an email to receive it! I won&#x27;t use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I love pureology, plain and simple. I always come back to this shampoo and conditioner. Seller was great, so much more economical to buy 1)on amazon, it&#x27;s wayyy less expensive than I ever see in a store or another site and 2) the big sizes. I did the math back when I was deciding whether to commit to spending that much on shampoo and conditioner, but if you like it you get so much more for your dollar.</li>
    <li> I have been using Volume Pureology shampoo in these big bottles for several years and ran out. I saw this on Amazon and bought the volume shampoo and conditioner and while it smelled similar it is not the same shampoo that I have been using. I lathered my shoulder length hair up and it stuck together almost like glue and I could not really lather it up a second time and couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair. I rinsed it and had to use tons of conditioner to make it soft again and tangle free. I tried two more times later in the week and the same thing happened. I went back to the little Pureology shampoo that I had left in my old bottle and I did not have any problems. I am sending both the shampoo and conditioner back, this is crapola!!!!</li>
    <li> Product was changed or something.  The shampoo must have a new chemical make up.  Not sure what happened but it made my hair stiff</li>
    <li> The contents of these bottles, was &amp;#34;bogus&amp;#34;! I have used Pureology products, for a very long time. I know what it should look, smell and perform like! It made my hair unmanageable and stiff! Had to quit using it! WOULD LIKE TO RETURN BOTH, IF POSSIBLE!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for several years.  What I got this time is not the same.  When I apply the shampoo to my wet hair my hair becomes a bundle of knots which then requires a lot of conditioner to smooth out.  This is not what I have had in the past which makes me wonder if what I purchased was real Purelogy.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. Lives up to it&#x27;s name Pure Volume.  I have super straight fine hair and it really helps add volume and body. Nothing beats salon quality hair products. Love the scent too.</li>
    <li> Pureology is the ONLY shampoo/conditioner that I use! Leaves my hair clean and shiny! Great product and at a great price! Can&#x27;t go wrong with Pureology!</li>
    <li> The conditioner &amp; shampoo I received were not anything like the Pureology product I&#x27;ve purchased in the salon. The shampoo I received through this company left my hair feeling coarse and dry. The fragrance was different as well. I feel hoodwinked in purchasing this product as it is obviously not the true Pureology volume shampoo brand portrayed as.&lt;br /&gt;*Update: Just returned both the conditioner and shampoo as they were not the authentic product and stripped my hair badly and had to pay an additional $20 in shipping! What a SCAM!!! I even went to a salon and purchased the actual product and they were NOT at all similar in any way...texture, fragrance or color. Obviously not Pureology product!! They would not reimburse shipping fees for their false product. I will not ever purchase from this company again and I recommend you purchase your products through another company. If nothing else to avoid the possible return shipping costs!</li>
    <li> I have been using Pureology products for years and can tell you these are cheap fake knock offs not the real thing. The shampoo wouldn&#x27;t lather and after using the conditioner my hair was tangled and I had a hard time getting a brush through it. After blow drying, my hair was flat, dry as straw and smelled like plastic I have never had that happen with authentic Pureology products. I returned these the next day after I received them. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I do not usually write reviews, but I though I had to share my experience with this purchase. I usually find reviews very useful. I used this product before and liked it. But this last order, the shampoo (which says it is a new formula) scent is not the same (not as nice) and as soon as I put it on, my hair feels dry and stiff. I can&#x27;t even put may fingers through my hair while washing it. It is horrible. I do not know if is because is a new formula or not really Pureology.  The conditioner scent is the same and it makes my hair come back to life after putting on the shampoo (thankfully). I only used it for two weeks and finally stop using it. This product is so expensive, I feel bad to throw it away so it sitting on my shower:( Very disappointed with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> love it, tried Keratin shampoo to but this one is much better.  It helps keep the color while making it feel fuller.</li>
    <li> GREAT  PRODUCT  BEEN USING FOR YEARS  PRICE IF YOU BUY IN STORE OR  SALON YOU PUY DOUBLE</li>
    <li> I received what is likely expired product. I want to ask if I could return as well. I have been using this product for five years, and first time purchased online through Amazon retailer. Suddenly, the soap did not lather, and the shampoo left my hair feeling really dry and icky (IN THE SHOWER). This is NOT normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner wasn&#x27;t as bad, but I can tell it is not as potent as it should be. I have to use a leave-in conditioner just to make my hair feel soft again. Sadly, I am going to not be able to use these 33oz containers, my hair cannot take it!  Shame too, because this stuff is so expensive!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and have used several volumizing products over the years.  This Pureology set has added more fullness to my hair than any other product I have tried.  It&#x27;s wonderful !</li>
    <li> I love it.My hair is super baby fine &amp; I was having a problem with breakage, got a sample of the shampoo &amp; conditioner. The breakage stopped immediately! So had to buy more. The shampoo does seem to tangle my hair but using a tiny amount of conditioner (not even the size of a dime) gets rid of every tangle. Leaving my hair even softer than it naturally is</li>
    <li> The product was just what I wanted and it came with pumps for dispensing.</li>
    <li> I never used to pay this much attention to what shampoo I use. But recently whether it is the heat or what, my scalp started itching a lot. Now, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but on second day I am starting to have feeling that I have flees. So I&#x27;ve opted for more natural shampoo and it seems to work better. Its still not perfect but much better. I love the scent of it and as a matter of fact the conditioner reminds me a lot of my favorite parfum \\&quot;Vanilla fields\\&quot; by Coty, that I&#x27;ve used 10 years ago. Every time I use it, it brings me back. I love it.</li>
    <li> I had a horrible experience this morning when I opened up my brand new bottle of Pureology Pure Volume shampoo (I bought the bundled set of shampoo and conditioner last week).  The shampoo made my hair sticky and heavy and coarse, and felt like I was washing it in hand soap or something worse.  I was afraid I was going to do permanent damage to my hair.  It wouldn&#x27;t rinse out, and I had to use my husband&#x27;s Herbal Essence Shampoo just to get it out of my hair in any reasonable way.  I have no idea what was wrong with the formulation of this particular bottle of shampoo -- but I&#x27;ve bought it before from Amazon.com and never had this issue.  I don&#x27;t know if shampoo can go bad, or if it&#x27;s something in this particular lot that was mis-formulated.  I need to figure out ASAP how to return it and get my money back.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Used for years. Speedy delivery from seller.  Great price compared to salon or stores.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo and conditioner.  I use for color treated hair but my daughter swears by this product for her very long naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Exact same product at a spectacular price!!</li>
    <li> It did make my hair have more volume but it made it feel like straw and made it look damaged (broken off).</li>
    <li> Not at all quality Pureology products that I have used for years - so disappointing! After using the products purchased from this seller for a month or so, my hair texture became dull and lifeless. Now I am stuck with large quantity of a worthless product. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these products.</li>
    <li> This Pureology Shampoo and Conditioner may be a bit on the expensive side, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. The smaller bottles (around 10-12 oz) last for 3-4 months because you don&#x27;t have to use as much product. I went with the larger bottles because the price per ounce was better. Also cheaper than you can get in the salons!</li>
    <li> Price was right.  This is the product I use and it is nice to get it at a good price delivered to the door.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I have used the products for over a year now and are very satisfied.  The price however has gotten out of control!  We are not sure we&#x27;ll be spending the $ anymore!  Very close to $100 for shampoo and conditioner is getting a little crazy!</li>
    <li> Shipped even earlier than expected. That&#x27;s a plus. Yet does not seem to be the same product you find in the salons. Graphics on bottle were not the same as well as directions. Does smell the same. Just not the same performance.</li>
    <li> I wanted to order the biggest quantities of the shampoo and conditioner that I could because I have used it for so many years and have always loved the way it made my color not fade and how good it smelled and generally what it did for my hair!   Well this must not be the real thing because I can&#x27;t even use it!  My hair looks and feels like straw and I hate it.  Now I am out $80.00 and have no recourse because I did not use it for about a month after I got it.  This is really unacceptable and aggravating.  Why would they ruin such a great product?</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and have tried everything. These products are worth the price because they definitely add volume. Buying in large sizes saves money. The other pureology styling products I have treid are great too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been using this product years ago since it came out. I can always find a better deal on amazon</li>
    <li> I love pureology. I usually use the hydrating but I needed some volume and this shampoo is perfect, smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
    <li> This is not the real product I don&#x27;t even use what I bought because it makes my hair feel like glue is in it. They messed with this product and I know this because my parents buy from a salon and theirs is the best. What I got was totally different. I should make Amazon give me my money back. Don&#x27;t but online.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughters love this shampoo.  It is a little expensive but they only have to use 1/4 the amount of shampoo they normally would so these bottles last us for a number of months</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo by far.  It lasts forever, way longer than other cheaper shampoos I have tried (the liter lasted me over a year, while other cheaper brands, like Aveda, were gone in 6 months).  You just need less because it&#x27;s so concentrated.  It smells lovely and the smell survives most of the day.  Also, my fine hair has more volume and styles more easily than with other products I have tried, with less styling product.  Definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Not as  good as the regular shampoo.  It feels like it&#x27;s more water downed.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews that this is not the actual Pureology product.  I have used the shampoo for years and this shampoo was terrible!!  It dried my hair out terribly.</li>
    <li> I have used and loved Pureology for years so was thrilled to find the shampoo and conditioner on Amazon at such a great discount.  However this is not the same product I have used.  The shampoo was extremely drying and left my hair matted.  The conditioner felt more like hand lotion than conditioner.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> First, I have to say that I have used this product before and loved it. I have a hard time finding Pureology and decided to try online. I was wary buying such an expensive hair care product online, because you never know if you are getting what you pay for, but was very happy with this supplier. The product showed up on time, and it was legit.</li>
    <li> Company was purchased by Loreal Cosmetics and they changed the formula.  Smell is different and it didn&#x27;t lather up as usual.&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt wiry after shampooing.</li>
    <li> My stylist had recommended these products for my fine, thin hair.  It gives my hair body without weighing it down.  This product was fairly expensive at local stores, but the prices at Amazon make it more affordable.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the seller and ran over to Ulta as soon as the product arrived to verify that it was real.  It&#x27;s the real deal.  I was concerned about the dryness because I saw complaints about the shampoo drying hair out.  I can see how if you only use the shampoo it would dry your hair out but the combination of the two gives me a healthy volume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky but this shampoo rocks.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years and my hair never gets tired of it. My hair is easily weighed down but this product NEVER feels heavy.  I love the liters and a good price here.  I keep coming back.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have ever written, but am angry enough to spend the energy to prevent someone else from making the mistake I made.  I have ordered many bottles of pureology in the past, but this last order with this &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; type was terrible! It was like washing my hair with honey.  It was all tangled &amp; matted.  It was harmning my hair instead of washing/helping it.  I don&#x27;t know if they replaced this solution with an off brand and used the pureology bottle, or if its expired or what...all I know is I just flushed money down the drain.  Im trying to return, but is saying Im outside the return window.  I can&#x27;t help I just got finished with my current bottle, and opened this for the first time yesterday morning! Im really upset</li>
    <li> Hi, I like the product very much. But is has chemical in it like any other. I am changing my habits slowly for things a bit more natural. Otherwise, good service, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner.  Expensive, but worth it if you want your hair color to last longer.</li>
    <li> Both shampoo and conditioner are expired and cannot use either one, wasted money</li>
    <li> I have never used pureology, however my coworkers who have smelled it an said it seems legitimate.  After 1 use I believe it is the real thing, unlike what other are saying. That being said I purchased through the vendor that amazon fulfilled. [...]</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever been this excited about initially trying a hair product, and consequently never more disappointed! As I am leaving my carefree, drugstore brand 20&#x27;s and turning 30 soon, I decided to go out on a limb of trying some more sophisticated beauty beauty products to omph up my thin, long, straight, flat hair. I heard rave reviews of this product online and from friends and family, Including my hairdresser who was appalled I wasn&#x27;t  already using it religiously. I am a thrifty gal at heart, but if something is really that superior, I thought I had to try it.. I even did the little test on the product website to find out which product is best for my hair type, and made sure I bought the &amp;#34;extra care&amp;#34; version. My hair is now a completely unmanagable mess!! Not sleek or shiny at all! You know how your hair is supposed to feel all silky and slippery after conditioning?... Yeah.. None of that at all! It feels like there is glue in it or some sticky polymer that causes my ends to knot all up and need a jackhammer to comb through. Any humidity at all causes a halo of frizz! No volume at the crown where I really want it.  I desperately hate this product and wish I wouldn&#x27;t have let myself be heckled into wasting so much money on it! It may work for different hair types, but certainly not mine! :(</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if I am extremely unhappy w/ the shampoo &amp; conditioner or the other products, but I wanted to warn you just the same.  I purchased the line of Pure Volume products.  I got the shampoo, conditioner, masque and blow ampliphier.  I have been using Aveda and Bedhead, which I love, but have had issues w/ my hair being very dry.  I heard so many wonderful things about Pureology, I thought I&#x27;d try it. Boy am I sorry I did.  My hair is even more dry than it was and feels like straw.  It looks like I just woke up out of bed and didn&#x27;t brush my hair.  It feels very waxy, sticky, brittle and dirty.  I am going to give the shampoo and conditioner one more try w/ out the other 2 products, but right now I am EXTREMELY disappointed.  I look like I have 80s hair.  If you are going to try this product, I don&#x27;t recommend you try the entire line at once.  This product is way to expensive to give these results!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been using Pureology Volumizing Conditioner for years, and we both love it! I finally got fed up with her taking my bottle when she ran out of hers...So I bought this huge bulk quantity size, after seeing the great deal this company offers for these products.  As I said, we have been using this for several years, and really love how it makes our hair feel, smell, and the volume it gives. I can assure you that I&#x27;ve never found it for a better price anywhere else. Try it---I think you&#x27;ll really like it. ---By the way, my order arrived just 2 days after I placed it!, I could not ask for a better price or better delivery service!</li>
    <li> I love the real thing, but this is a knock-off.  Amazon, please do not let this seller list reviews for the original product.  Yes, it is awesome; but this is like washing your hair with Dove bar soap!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in these bottles but it&#x27;s NOT Pureology! I&#x27;ve been using Pureology for over 10 years and it&#x27;s never leaved my hair in this condition! Very matted when wet, hard to untangle with multiple leave-in conditioners applied. And the result after it&#x27;s dry? Just that!! DRY!! My hair is - was - in excellent condition. This stuff is awful!! Do NOT buy!!</li>
    <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the shampoo.  It didn&#x27;t lather up well at all and leaves me wondering if there was a formulation change as I&#x27;ve used it before and liked it.</li>
    <li> Prior to my wedding in August, I started using salon brand shampoo and conditioner and what a difference it made.  I started with Kerataise (too expensive), then lanza (left my hair greasy).  Then my stylist reccomended purology to me and it is wonderful.  It keeps my hair feeling like silk with no residue or making my scalp dry or itchy.  You only need to use a very small amount and my hair is fairly long.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have bought this brand of shampoo and conditioner. When I used it for the first wash it felt like it stripped my hair of moisture and left it feeling like straw. I thought the conditioner would help but even after using the conditioner there was no way I could comb out my hair when I got out of the shower. I have thin, straight, long, color treated hair. I used some pureology instant repair leave in conditioner on my hair and then I could barely comb through my hair. Much of it being pulled out. This conditioner and shampoo does not moisturize well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not good either. The shampoo smells medicinal or like weeds or something. The conditioner does not have as strong of a smell but neither one has a nice smell as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had just dyed my hair before starting to use these products. I usually have to dye my hair every 4 weeks because the black hair color I use will never stay in longer than that. Well, using this shampoo and conditioner my hair color is extremely washed out after only 2 weeks of use. It totally took the color out of my hair. My hair is looking very brown now. I have never used a shampoo and conditioner that has stripped the color from my hair so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor did ship the product quickly and I received my order within a few days but I would never buy these products again. I&#x27;m going to stop using them altogether now. It seems like they are just damaging my hair rather than helping it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as far as seeing any volume. There was absolutely no difference in the look of volume of my hair while using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in these products. I would get my money back but they are not guaranteed when purchased online.</li>
    <li> As stated in other reviews, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like the one I bought at a salon.  Conditioner is consistent with salon product.  I have very fine hair, after shampooing it feels like straw so conditioner is a must.  A little product goes a long way for shoulder length hair.  It has added volume and overall may purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Reasonably priced</li>
    <li> We love this stuff and pay $60/bottle at our salon and Ulta store. This was a terrific deal and we will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Great Product increases the volume in your hair and helps maintain color in treated hair.  Leaves hair soft and product is not harsh.</li>
