      <li>This is ok if you can find someone to help you pierce your ear but for do it yourselfers just go to the ear piercing places and let them do it right.  </li>
      <li>When I recieved it, it was clean, sealed in a package.</li>
      <li>The order was packaged just right for shipment, it arrived in fine shape.</li>
      <li>but you really need to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get infected) while keeping the earring in</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not really painful as earlobes don&#x27;t have an abundance of nerve endings.  </li>

      <li>This works okay, but you need to get it right the first time.  </li>
      <li>It did it job and did it right very recommended to buy it is safe and all.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and the stud is nice and sharp for a clean shot.</li>
      <li>didnt even know at first!</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t fun having them hanging off my ears.</li>
      <li>, if you don&#x27;t have a very steady hand yourself, have someone else do it for you!</li>
      <li>Very very well made.</li>
      <li>Ordered 2 .......1 worked OK but did not apply the back to the earring.</li>
      <li>It worked pretty well</li>

      <li>At first I thought it was broke</li>
      <li>incase a daughter or friend wants another piercing!</li>
      <li>And package was easy to open.</li>
      <li>so I could do my daughters second hole for her ears,,,They are easy to use...</li>
      <li>Mine came with a sparkly crystal - a nice little surprise.</li>
      <li>I am a little thrilled I will convince a friend to do my pierce</li>
      <li>Stainless Steal earring and everything.</li>

      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>you so much</li>
      <li>but it was fast.</li>
      <li>Very flimsy.  </li>
      <li>It sees clean and as soon is possible</li>
      <li>This was quick and simple and practically painless.</li>
      <li>but if you look at it carefully it&#x27;s not complex to figure out.  </li>
      <li>I might buy a new one...</li>
      <li>After my new dangle comes I&#x27;ll have had this one in almost two months.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>the gun is okay, extremely small and the push barrel got jamed so</li>
      <li>The only reason why I don&#x27;t like this product is it doesn&#x27;t really pierce your ear!</li>
      <li>and it shouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near $5.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t use it and won&#x27;t bother sending it back because shipping to return it costs almost what unpaid for it.</li>
      <li>I even fixed one for my mother.</li>
      <li>I can only wear real silver and never had a single problem with this one.</li>

<li> I can only wear real silver and never had a single problem with this one.</li>
<li> It took a long time to work up the courage to do the second ear.  </li>
<li> This was really cheap (cost very little too) and difficult to push through, you really need someone to help if you&#x27;re going to buy it.  </li>
<li> so it is a little hard to clean it.</li>
<li> I mean really, it was the SAME thing.</li>
<li> When using these my friend had to pop the earring back out of if with a pin because it was jammed in both of the ones I bought.</li>
<li> You center it, bring the middle section together and just push the plunger.  </li>
<li> but its only the price I payed so I should have expected it .</li>
<li> but you have to wiggle the back part down to get it off.  </li>
<li> and they only have rubber backs and they  don&#x27;t line up w ea other because the post hangs down when you put it in.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a little tricky but would definitely buy again.</li>
<li> it was a little tricky trying to get the kit back off me.</li>
<li> It is also very tiny and hard to handle and get properly into place</li>
<li> I found it more painful and unwieldy than a piercing gun.</li>
<li> One of my ears closed up and needed to be pierced again</li>
<li> The other earring would NOT press through the gun.</li>
<li> This product is VERY cheap in every respect, poorly designed/made, extremely difficult to use and is manually operated - it is not a &amp;#34;gun&amp;#34;, ie: it doesn&#x27;t have a trigger, you have to squeeze the device together yourself and it may not even go through all the way -- meaning you have to force the stud through yourself.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I found this piercer difficult to use.  It&#x27;s not spring loaded and I had trouble removing the stud once the piercing happened. You basically have to squeeze it until it pierces your ear.  I found it more painful and unwieldy than a piercing gun.</li>
    <li> Had no problem with this put it to my ear punch it and done</li>
    <li> One of the earrings was paired with a back that was too big!  Terrible!!</li>
    <li> finally arrive it !&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are the greatest things. reminds me of when we were 14 year old rebels swiping them from the drug store and piercing our ears in the car.&lt;br /&gt;The surgical stud doesn&#x27;t even look that bad. After my new dangle comes I&#x27;ll have had this one in almost two months.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t hurt, it was easy to find the ink marking I had made in my lobe.&lt;br /&gt;After I pierced it it was a little tricky trying to get the kit back off me. But I have never taken the earring out since.</li>
    <li> Finally came, worked no complaints of product</li>
    <li> Nice to have on hand incase a daughter or friend wants another piercing!</li>
    <li> worked great i ordered two one got stuck for a second but was all the way pierced so not a big deal</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I would use it but I gave it away after I decided not to. It does come with a ear ring stud already in it and it is sealed.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm. Perfect for self piercing. Would recommend...  Easy to use...</li>
    <li> Ordered two to repierce my ears and one broke while I was trying to use it.  It is also very tiny and hard to handle and get properly into place</li>
    <li> It was great product i pierce my baby ears</li>
    <li> I have purchased a couple of these, and they work great, are sterile, and the earrings is of quality. I can only wear real silver and never had a single problem with this one. As with ANY piercing, make sure to keep it clean with peroxide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would recommend, if you don&#x27;t have a very steady hand yourself, have someone else do it for you! I messed one of mine up cuz my hand jerked and I didn&#x27;t get it through right... :( Other than that, GREAT PRODUCT! :)</li>
    <li> When using these my friend had to pop the earring back out of if with a pin because it was jammed in both of the ones I bought. Wasn&#x27;t fun having them hanging off my ears. Plus, I don&#x27;t know what the earrings are made of, but it feels as if my ears are fighting infection or an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Never used.  Made in China.  Some of the instructions on how to use this product did not translate.  Very flimsy.  You have to push the pin through the ear yourself.</li>
    <li> This works okay, but you need to get it right the first time.  Once the ear was pierced, the earring back was hard to separate from the piercing gun, and it is painful trying to get it to release.  It got the job done.</li>
    <li> I pierced my cartledge with it and worked amazing I&#x27;m so glad I got it</li>
    <li> the gun is okay, extremely small and the push barrel got jamed so the gun was hanging on my ear. painful</li>
    <li> This is ok if you can find someone to help you pierce your ear but for do it yourselfers just go to the ear piercing places and let them do it right.  This was really cheap (cost very little too) and difficult to push through, you really need someone to help if you&#x27;re going to buy it.  And I&#x27;m not sure how sterile it is.</li>
    <li> Very gud smells of injection lol :) buy this save urself madd bread son jus no where your going to poke iight</li>
    <li> I bought this same one, for cheaper. Its a one time use gun and it shouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near $5. I mean really, it was the SAME thing. Stainless Steal earring and everything. And i got free shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought these so I could do my daughters second hole for her ears,,,They are easy to use...I would buy thses again.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I don&#x27;t like this product is it doesn&#x27;t really pierce your ear! I tried for 2 hours straight to shove the ear in my ear and it didn&#x27;t go through!</li>
    <li> I have been needing to re-pierce a couple of the holes in my ears where the earlobe was torn. This was quick and simple and practically painless. I even fixed one for my mother. It is so much trouble to find someone to pierce your ears. Half the time, they don&#x27;t get the holes even. This worked great!</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fast shipment. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy to use , peirced my friends daughters ears and it did hurt her a bit but it was fast. Would recommend.the studs are cute too</li>
    <li> Cheep, easy, no problems!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results of using 2 of these on my left and right ear lobe. The order was packaged just right for shipment, it arrived in fine shape. And package was easy to open. And the product was just as advertized and worked properly when I used them to pierce my ears...Very Happy would do business again..Thanks...</li>
    <li> So easy to use.  You literally just put the piercer in the ear and squeeze and that&#x27;s it.  The only I will say is that when you try and remove it once it&#x27;s pierced it&#x27;s a little tricky but would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be great. But I was wrong. You can only use the earings it comes with and they only have rubber backs and they  don&#x27;t line up w ea other because the post hangs down when you put it in. I won&#x27;t use it and won&#x27;t bother sending it back because shipping to return it costs almost what unpaid for it. Disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This product was fantastic! Very very well made. Easy to use and the stud is nice and sharp for a clean shot. Very pleased. Reusable as well which is a plus. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Works awful! The gun gets stuck together when you pierce the ears and you have to snatch it apart.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Invest in a better quality, autoclavable metal device. This product is VERY cheap in every respect, poorly designed/made, extremely difficult to use and is manually operated - it is not a &amp;#34;gun&amp;#34;, ie: it doesn&#x27;t have a trigger, you have to squeeze the device together yourself and it may not even go through all the way -- meaning you have to force the stud through yourself. Also, the stud is VERY short - not good for fleshier/thicker lobes or... wherever. ESPECIALLY not good for self-piercing! Wish I could have given negative stars.</li>
    <li> these are great love them</li>
    <li> This item is so little . but its only the price I payed so I should have expected it .</li>
    <li> It did it job and did it right very recommended to buy it is safe and all. I might buy a new one...</li>
    <li> It was not a good product. My own faught . Should have bought a better one.  I will know better next time.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work.  stud went in crookedly</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use - I recommend it to everyone.  One of my ears closed up and needed to be pierced again and this was perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions but if you look at it carefully it&#x27;s not complex to figure out.  It&#x27;s a little tricky centering the hole perfectly so you might want to enlist the help of a friend.  You center it, bring the middle section together and just push the plunger.  It&#x27;s not really painful as earlobes don&#x27;t have an abundance of nerve endings.  You could never get me to lance my fingertip to get a drop of blood, but i pierced my ear without hesitation.  A couple of seconds and the earring stud is in place.  The front part of the applicator releases but you have to wiggle the back part down to get it off.  Mine came with a sparkly crystal - a nice little surprise.</li>
    <li> This product works in that it pierces your ear...well, actually you pierce your ear.  You have to push hard to get it through your ear lobe and if you are squeamish it may be tough.  It took a long time to work up the courage to do the second ear.  I would recommend you get a piercing gun and do it that way if you are the least bit squeamish.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, like at all. and I don&#x27;t really mind because yanno, it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> Works good, my ear was already partially open. It like snapped in like a staple.</li>
    <li> It sees clean and as soon is possible i ll try it I am a little thrilled I will convince a friend to do my pierce</li>
    <li> Package was open when arrived. Nothing was in the package.</li>
    <li> Ehh it was okay. It would&#x27;ve been better if I didn&#x27;t have to squeeze it myself lol. I might as well have pierced my ear with a needle.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 .......1 worked OK but did not apply the back to the earring. The other earring would NOT press through the gun. It was basically garbage. NOT at all happy with this item.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use definitely worth it</li>
    <li> This was actually awesome! Although there are some drawbacks, it was painless and easy! I pierced my cartilage with this and it didn&#x27;t even hurt! When I recieved it, it was clean, sealed in a package. I took it out and the blue thing that pushes the earring fell out. At first I thought it was broke but it wasnt, its not connected to the gun. I just put it back in. I iced my ear well before I pierced and when it went in I didnt even know at first! Its been almost a week now and I have no infections. But, the earring is bulky so it is a little hard to clean it. I take the back off of the earring (this part hurts quite a bit but you really need to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get infected) while keeping the earring in and then I put cleaner on a q tip and make sure I get cleaner in there good. Overall this is a great product and I will repurchase!</li>
