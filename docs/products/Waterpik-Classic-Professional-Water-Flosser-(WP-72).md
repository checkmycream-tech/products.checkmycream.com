<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A bit noisy, but it delivers !  Several tips,water pressure adjustment feature...a good dental tool to have in your arsenal - don&#x27;t forget to floss!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the waterpik for many years.  They each have lasted  several years.  My dentist is a big proponent of this tool.  It is a good idea for everyone to use one.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I have used them for more than 20 years</li>
    <li> This model is very quiet but powerful.</li>
    <li> This is my second of these over a period of years.  The equipment held up very well.  Like it a lot and it has improved my dental health - less annoying that flossing too.</li>
    <li> More than I expected! Wonderful! Didn&#x27;t realize it took the place of regular flossing. Cleans. Refreshes.</li>
    <li> Had 1 for years and used it daily. This 1 is more compact and like that greatly. Works great as I knew it would.</li>
    <li> Smaller than my older one and just as powerful. I am consistently surprised how much stuff it removes.</li>
    <li> I love this water pic. It&#x27;s a reasonable price and works just as good as the higher priced ones. It&#x27;s easy to use and store. I should have bought this sooner.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and I use it twice a day!</li>
    <li> Lowest setting of unit is still a high shot of water. This replaces an older Waterpic and was recommended by my husbands dentist. He is using it but grumbling about the water pressure. I think he may try to re-engineer it. He probably should have gotten the unit with more settings.</li>
    <li> Why the heck did I pay $40 for this. I never use it.&lt;br /&gt;As water picks go, it does the job. Very noisy, high pressure even on the lowest setting. It comes with a couple heads but they all seem to do the same thing. Mostly just a fun way to have waterfights after brushing our teeth. I actually got it to flush my tonsils, but it is much too strong and hurts and gags me even on the lowest setting. It works fine for teeth but does splatter water everywhere because its at such pressure.</li>
    <li> works well, but no instructions</li>
    <li> Portable and easy to use. A bit on the loud side but most units are.</li>
    <li> Purchased it as a gift for my husband and he says it works great.</li>
    <li> Wish it came with a lid</li>
    <li> Love it!  I had one before when I wore braces and somehow in the shuffle of moving it disappeared.  It makes my mouth feel so clean!</li>
    <li> It would have been 5 stars but the water container does not fit easily on the base unit. Takes a lot of work to get it on properly.</li>
    <li> A fun little contraption.</li>
    <li> Works well, but don&#x27;t put the water pick down on anything below the level of the water tank - it will syphon out water all over your counter.</li>
    <li> This is a great little machine.  Never ceases to amaze me how it can still flush out left-over debris from between the teeth even after flossing and brushing.  A must have for good oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Holds plenty of water for thoroughly rinsing teeth. Leaks slightly under the unit, but not badly enough to return. Would have given it five stars otherwise. Easy to connect reservoir to unit, and can be removed without a fight, Pics are more difficult to remove. Very strong pulsing, I&#x27;m using it on #1 and it is easily as strong as #3 or 4 on my older models.</li>
    <li> This water flosser really does the job.  Makes my mouth feel clean and fresh</li>
    <li> A little bit noisy but it works Excellent!</li>
    <li> This replaced a similar model that looked identical to the new version. The new version works fine, but appears to be very cheapened.  It is noisier, shakier, and puts out less pressure than the one it replaces. Hopefully it will have close to the life of the original.</li>
    <li> I am so loving this item. It takes a while to get use to it but what a difference it has made in my oral upkeep. Wish it was a travel one, so I could use when out and about. Very happy with this item. Love the feel of cleanliness throughout all my teeth. I use to floss 15 times a day or maybe exaggerating but every single time I ate anything. This seems to have lessened that necessity.</li>
    <li> The person I gave this to is satisfied.</li>
    <li> Slight leak when not in use, otherwise would have been 5 stars. Does a great job &amp; pressure is good</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Better than expected.</li>
    <li> It works and does the job but I am not impressed.  If I have to choose again, I will try a different brand as feels a lot more clumsy compare waterpik.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an excellent machine.  It is much more powerful than my old one, which took some getting used to.  the only gripe I have is that is is very loud.  However, that is something I can live with.  Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> You really see and feel the difference after use. Large water basin makes it so you don&#x27;t have to constantly refill. Does take up quite a bit of counter space, however. Very loud as well.</li>
    <li> I will try this unit soon,  My old one lasted 12 years.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  No frills and does the job.</li>
    <li> These work well and don&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> Cannot live without it!</li>
    <li> It neither exceeded or failed my expectations and was at the price I was willing to pay. So that&#x27;s a positive transaction.&lt;br /&gt;The picks/Probes are a little shorter that my previous WaterPik so they&#x27;re not compatible and that was a drawback making my old inventory obsolete. Better research on my part might have avoided this surprise. Otherwise its a good device that works fine.</li>
    <li> Does a great job and is quieter than older models</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how to review it....we needed a Waterpik to clean under crowns and braces.  This works just fine.</li>
    <li> This is the third Waterpik that I have had in 20-ish years and I use it twice a day. 20 years ago I started with a basic model, similar to this one, then upgraded to a slightly glitzier blue model, and then got this one. This machine is no joke! I didn&#x27;t realize how underpowered the upgraded blue model was, or had become. Granted, I had nursed it along well past its prime (cracked reservoir and tubing), and it probably had  been going downhill for a while. I always had the blue model set on the firmest setting and thought I was doing so well (my dentist was only moderately impressed). When I used this for the first time, I had to put it at the very weakest setting and I realized my gums had a long way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great machine with an appropriate price. No frills,  but it will do the job very well. If you have been using an older machine for a while, consider replacing it.</li>
    <li> I first used waterpik with my braces in high school.  The only thing that helped my railroad tracks clean.&lt;br /&gt; I thought I was buying the right replacement unit--my last one went was good for about 3 years, but the tubing broke.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this is not that unit.&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s jet-engine noisy. It&#x27;s obnoxiously loud, so much more than a hair dryer, so you&#x27;ll need to wear ear plugs.&lt;br /&gt;2. It shakes a lot.  It vibrates a great deal which was also a surprise,&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s difficult to get the filled water cup plugged into the gasket on top of the unit. This phenomenon is worse when you&#x27;re tired.&lt;br /&gt;4. The control buttons are cheaper and more, well, plasticky.&lt;br /&gt;5. The units cost less at Walmart.  Bloody hell.&lt;br /&gt;But, we all need Waterpiks to keep our teeth clean, as they do just that.</li>
    <li> This flosser is great! It&#x27;s very soothing and does an amazing job cleaning up my gum line!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the best model of the entire line. The tank is big enough that you don&#x27;t run out of water, you can get replacement parts for a reasonable price, the pressure is easily adjustable. What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
    <li> Overall, its fine...except for attaching the water container to the base; it can be vexing!  My wife and I complain that at times it is  difficult to align the two components together.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my son who just got braces. Much easier for him to keep his teeth clean. Beats traditional flossing any day!</li>
    <li> This product works fine but I had to purchase it because my last device that I purchased two years ago was squirting water out the hose.  I could have bought a replacement hose but felt a new device would be better.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, my water pick sounds like a jack hammer.  A little loud as some people described would be fine but a jack hammer???  I had such high hopes for it to help with dental care but it is going back.</li>
    <li> Very effective for clean teeth &amp; healthy gums.  I especially like that the water reservoir is clear instead of blue, as everyone does not necessarily have blue decor.</li>
    <li> Great Product. I&#x27;ve always used Water Picks, this was a very nice model for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> A great device to help make up for not keeping up with your  teeth along the way.&lt;br /&gt;You will enjoy the ease of use, and the results are all you could expect.</li>
    <li> gift for elderly aunt...she&#x27;s happy!</li>
    <li> Great product so far.</li>
    <li> I tried different water picks n this one seems the most powerful.</li>
    <li> For people who hate to floss, this water flosser is ideal, and, in my opinion, even better than flossing with dental floss. My wife and I had an older unit of the same model, WP-72, that finally wore out. This new one works like a champ, i.e., even better than the old one we had. We would heartily recommend this unit to everyone who, like ourselves, don&#x27;t like to floss but need to flush out the debris.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much as the model with the blue container.  Looks too clinical and harder to handle.</li>
    <li> This was my second water pik. The first one was a different model, a handheld cordless, and it was unsatisfactory. But this one is great! It&#x27;s powerful, it works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to and my dentist is happy with me for using it. I recommend it 100%!</li>
    <li> Long term Water Pik user. Not loving the design, too large a foot print and an unwieldy eyesore on the side of my sink. First use was somewhat problematic until I learned to apply considerable pressure to firmly seat the water reservoir on the unit. Reservoir is way too</li>
    <li> Too loud. Cleans well.</li>
    <li> Used this for irrigation of nasal after surgery.  Worked great.  Good value.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected but I guess you get what you pay for. The stream stutters and when the machine is on it automatically squirts out water. So instead of pressing a button to start the flow, pressing the button stops the flow. Kinda funky, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to - sprays water in between your teeth to get crud out - so it gets 3 stars.</li>
    <li> It really gets the crud out from between the teeth.</li>
    <li> I purchased my waterpik because my dentist recommended that I use one to help with my gums and my overall cleaning. This is the third waterpik I have purchased.  My second one was purchased 5 years ago.  I was considering ordering a replacement hose but it was a little complicated for the model I have.  The replacement hose should work well on this model though.  I don&#x27;t know how long my first one lasted.  This one is a little quieter than my previous one.  Just remember to drain the water out of the hose when you are finished using.  You do this by removing the tank and holding the hose over the sink until all of the water has emptied out.  It should make the unit last a little longer.  If you have more than one person using the waterpik, you obviously will need to replace more often.  Overall, I really miss not having this to use when I go on vacation.  I had tried using one of those battery charged ones, but it did not last very long at all.  By purchasing this particular unit I don&#x27;t have to purchase any additional jet tips because I still have some left from my previous waterpik.</li>
    <li> Really good. I loved it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to my teeth.Very useful.</li>
    <li> Works fine, mouth feels fresh.</li>
    <li> This replaced the one I had which gave up the ghost after many years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this water flosser when it was on sale, and I think it was a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The many power settings are perfect, and a great range of water strength options.&lt;br /&gt;The highest setting it a bit harsh for new flossers, so it&#x27;s good to be able to select lower settings starting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s easy to snap the reservoir in, and start using it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a variety of flosser tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Loud. The pump makes quite a bit of noise, which may be an issue for some. For me it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but it was louder than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hold button to stop water takes some getting used to. Instead of pushing a button to activate the water stream, you hold down the button to stop the stream. This can take some getting used to and it&#x27;s easy to accidentally release the button and send water flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t specific to this brand, but using water flossers takes practice. You&#x27;ll want to angle it just right, keep your mouth closed, and learn how to floss without sending water flying out of your mouth and onto the mirror. It could be a bit of a learning curve to get used to, but for me it only took about 5 times before I started to get the hang of it. Just keep a towel handy to dry things off when you first try it out.</li>
    <li> Works great. Gets all the junk out.</li>
    <li> Always happy with water pik....</li>
    <li> A wonderful dental tool.</li>
    <li> I wish I had sprung for a quieter model.  I read some reviews, but wish I had read up on the other models, too.  The loudness is very off-putting, and the pause button causes the volume to increase.  (It&#x27;s hard for an arthritic old back to stay bent over a sink that long.)  The design is not all that convenient--on/off switch is back behind--I position the unit to allow maximum stretch of the stiff, curled tubing.  I do think this will help me keep my gums healthier, but when this unit expires, I will definitely get an upgraded model.  I phoned Water-Pik and asked if the unit was supposed to sound like a jack-hammer; the suggestion was to put a hand-towel under it (which I already had done.)  OH well.  If we had small kids in the house, this would be returned, but I&#x27;m not going to bother.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist&#x27;s office.  Took a bit of getting used to before I could use it without having to mop up the bathroom and mirror.  Amazing the small bits it can flush out, even when you think you got it all already.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old older model.  It&#x27;s better.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Loved this when it was working - Less than 2 months later it quit, and I am unable to return it!  The last one I had lasted over 5 years.  Piece of junk as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> this is my third  unit, its great</li>
    <li> Nice Waterpik for the price but not happy about no dust cover for the reservoir.  I had to fashion a homemade one from a piece of plastic as it is just not practical to empty, dry and turn the reservoir over and use as a cap for daily use.</li>
    <li> My dad likes it.  He uses the smaller reservoir.  I would give it 5 stars but it is noisier than the other Waterpiks that we have.</li>
    <li> This water pik really gets out the hulls after eating popcorn.  Noisy little machine but it works and cleans well between the teeth</li>
    <li> I bought my first Waterpik in the mid 80s.  I had a bleeding gum and somehow found out about the relief this device provides.  I had the first one for twenty years, which met its unfortunate end when I turned it on and there was no power.  That was because the defective GFI breaker had blown again (and in need of replacement).  However, when I went to reset the breaker, I forgot to turn the Waterpik off and I further forgot to get back to the Waterpik.  Whay happened was its pump had an internal meltdown from running dry for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second one didn&#x27;t last nearly so long. I dropped it one to many times into the sink which ruined its pumping ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m&#x27; on the third one, which was a used one already.  I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry to replace the second one that I had bought because I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying a new one so soon again.  However, I had a wake-up moment when my gum was getting infected because a piece of food was stuck deep in it.  I fortunately got it out with the second one, but it was barely had enough strength left in it after having been dropped so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The used third one however also had a problem when I got it.  The water leaked out of the handle and it was even weaker pumping than the second one had been.  Being a repair technician, I was able to get it working again after determining that it was the flow pause that was causing the problem.  My guess is that if the flow pause isn&#x27;t used, then the kind of failure the third one had would likely not occur.  (I don&#x27;t use the flow pause function, and suspect that might have been why the one I had previously bought new didn&#x27;t develop the leaking problem the used one had.)</li>
    <li> Can be hard to assemble and get working. The top has to be very firmly attached to the bottom for the water to flow. The motor is very noisy. The cord is not long enough for me to use it at the sink, so I use it over the toilet.</li>
    <li> Got it to keep a bridge cleaned out.  it works great.</li>
    <li> This item is pretty much perfect! It&#x27;s compact and, due to the coloring, doesn&#x27;t catch your eye. Aside from the extra water basin for the special deep clean, the water basin can be flipped over and used to \\&quot;protect\\&quot; everything on the base - I don&#x27;t have to worry about dust as much. That said, you do have to make sure everything is nice and dry first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was easy to open and everything was in plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concerns:&lt;br /&gt;- the pause button is a bit difficult for me to use. If you don&#x27;t depress it hard enough water will leak out. This isn&#x27;t a problem for my husband, though so I think it&#x27;s a strength issue.&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT as of 4/17/14: I can now easily use the pause function. I think it was just sticky/unused; my husband has been using the button since the beginning and after a few weeks, I tried using the pause button again (previously, I ended up spraying 3 out of 4 walls, and myself). No problems now!***&lt;br /&gt;- the handle in general. Getting the different heads on isn&#x27;t so bad but when I&#x27;m actually using it to floss, I do think it could be more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;- the noise. To me, it&#x27;s even louder when you use the pause button. My husband hasn&#x27;t complained about this problem either, so maybe I&#x27;m just being too picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a fantastic product and a fair price. You can really feel the difference. I dislike flossing as it usually makes my gums bleed - NOT an issue with this product! I actually look forward to flossing because it&#x27;s soothing and fun (and healthy).</li>
    <li> FYI: do use filtered water or the pump will get clogged up,&lt;br /&gt;and the tube will age and rupture after 10 years of twist ,can find a replaced tube here at amazon</li>
    <li> Works as well as I expected maybe a little better. Easy to fill and easy to change heads. Adequate size tank to do all my teeth and gums. A nice surprise was the size. It looked larger in the photos but takes up less space on our tiny vanity than I imagined.</li>
    <li> easy to use and set up but noisy</li>
    <li> Knocks the food right out, especially with the pointed rubber tip.</li>
    <li> I have brushed and flossed my teeth for many years, but I always wanted to try the Water Pik. I still brush and floss, but you would be surprised at how much food is flushed out with the water flosser AFTER traditional flossing.</li>
    <li> Items purchased were exactly as described! Great Seller!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this water pic.  Light weight and easy to clean</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use with the Sinupulse Irrigator and it works very well.  It is well-made and operation is easy and quiet.  It is not too large to sit on my bathroom counter top.  Had no issues setting it up and using the first time.  So I can now clean my sinuses and teeth and gums with one item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too noisy !  I wouldn&#x27;t mind a refund on this too and find a quieter one.</li>
    <li> This water pik does have some power behind it! I like that, the only thing drawback: it is loud, but it probably has to be to work so well.</li>
    <li> If you have a decent amount of dental work, like I have, done on your teeth, you&#x27;ll really want this.  I have permanent bridge and removable one, root canals and some cosmetic work.  This works great.  Just don&#x27;t do it too hard as you can hurt yourself.  I use the string floss too but this still dislodges stuff from pockets and between teeth that the string nor the brushing cannot get.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Dentist recommended I get one. Definetly feel it works better than standard floss. East to learn how to use if new to this sort of product.</li>
    <li> Bought this on sale ($34) to be a backup in case my more current waterpik stopped working.  That day came yesterday.  Broke through the manufacturer&#x27;s seal and pulled out the contents only to discovery that no nozzles were included.  Because I bought it a year ago, it&#x27;s too late to return to Amazon.  Tried to use the nozzles from my other waterpiks, but none of them work.  Need the ones especially made for this model.  So now I have to buy these hard-to-find replacement nozzles that aren&#x27;t sold by Waterpik, and also, aren&#x27;t cheap. Even if they are the right ones for this model, not sure they would work well.  Without the nozzles in place, the water pressure seems to be weak.  The unit also has a clumsier setup than the newer models. A much larger water tank rests on top of the entire unit.  When it&#x27;s in pace and full of water, I&#x27;m thinking about whether it&#x27;s stable.  Stable or not, it&#x27;s harder to get to the buttons and nozzle thing.  All things considered, wish I had never bought this. Going to cut my losses, throw it away, and get a newer model. Hard to understand why another company isn&#x27;t making a good-quality alternative and giving Waterpik some competition.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.  Dental health has improved.</li>
    <li> Sad, voltage mismatch, burned out</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. I found that you have to be careful with the hose, they will kink and break.</li>
    <li> I read others&#x27; reviews about how messing it was to use this and thought they just didn&#x27;t know what they were doing.  Well, you can put me in that category or believe me when I say that not only will you get soaked, but so will your countertop, mirror, wall, etc.  The only way I can recommend this is if you plan to use it outside while wearing a raincoat.  Oh--and be sure to not use it in the morning after you&#x27;ve put on your makeup or done your hair because you&#x27;ll have to do it all again.  I set it on low, closed my mouth before turning it on, etc. (everything per instructions).  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> It is a waterpik but very clumsy to operate, I am ordering a better water pik now.</li>
    <li> Loud but meets my needs!</li>
    <li> Compact, easy to use, good power,&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the wire attached both water tunk and waterpik was not very much soft or flexible.</li>
    <li> Good for the money. Not as strong as the whatchamacallit brand that I bought from Amazon 10 years ago, which finally stopped working.  However, that one cost about $100.</li>
    <li> Very good adjustable pressure settings Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> There is no on off switch on the flosser handle like the rechargeable flossers.  You end up spraying the mirror and yourself while trying to start and stop the pump.  Poor Design</li>
    <li> Works great.  Large water capacity.</li>
    <li> Works very well, just a little noisy.</li>
    <li> It works, but I find it difficult to attach the water container correctly.  It would be nice if there was a lid for the water container.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted and nothing more. In the big chain stores, I would have needed to buy much more than I wished to for much more money. This water flosser is exactly like my old one and does a great job. Buying on-line was the way to go.</li>
    <li> This little water look works just fine, as expected. And I was really delighted that it packed easily in my suitcase, using the little resevoir instead of the large one. A bonus as I didn&#x27;t expect the little one</li>
    <li> Efficient, portable, easy to use. My dentist is happy.&lt;br /&gt;i travel a lot and needed a Waterpik every day. This fit the job</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always owned a waterpik wouldn&#x27;t be without one but this particular one is just very very loud, that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I liked it while it lasted. Only lasted 3 months before the handle started leaking &amp; then lost pressure. I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Waterpik always has good products!  Like how there is a smaller bucket.  Since it&#x27;s only me, it&#x27;s much more practical than the big one.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for a son who was having dental challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He cannot believe the amount of food particles that brushing and flossing leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!  It has a large water receptacle....a plus....allowing you to irrigate for a couple of minutes without having to refill; of course, if you choose to shorten the process-no problem.  I had a water flosser that needed the water to be refilled every few seconds and that was a major problem/inconvenience.</li>
    <li> lasted less then a year. won&#x27;t pump. even if you prime it. very loud. reservoir on top was always tricky to get seated properly. for 35 bucks it super sucks. locking mechanism for tube clumsy and awkward to attach.</li>
    <li> Always had good experiences with Waterpik products.  However, the motor did not work.  The 800 number reps would not accept my statement that motor didn&#x27;t work.  However, they talked me into a replacement part for my old Waterpik.  When the replacement worked in my old unit, I returned the new one for full refund.  In the end, I am pleased with result - saved money and have clean gums.</li>
    <li> This my first waterpik and it will be my last. These things are loud and extremely messy. The hose is much too short so that I need to bend over to use it and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;3&amp;#34;&#x27;. If you have trouble with your gums like me this makes a world of difference for your gums. I could never go back to string floss again. I can&#x27;t recommend it because I think if you don&#x27;t have dental problems you will send it back.</li>
    <li> For years, I have purchased Waterpiks.  Until recently it was possible to find a simple plug-in Waterpik  - cord, reservoir - for about $50.  The flow could be adjusted from torrential to weak.  The equivalent now costs about $100.  I made the mistake purchasing the &amp;#34;Waterpik Classic Professional Water Flosser&amp;#34;, available for about $50.  The whole set up is bigger but much less effective.  Very disappointing</li>
    <li> This water pic is great, it has different power settings and it come with 2 types of tips (one tip type has a double for a total of 3 tips). I only use the water jet and not the gum line tip. If you have regular teeth and don&#x27;t need anything special then one tip is all you need. Give it a week and you will get the hang of using it bc the 1st week I made a big mess with the water jet, It can be tricky to control and not get all the counter and mirror wet, but once you get the hang of it, the device is very handy and works great, better than the phillips sonic care airfloss (in my opinion) bc I like the continuos jet of water that you can feel cleaning. I use it every day at night before brushing my teeth, all the food particles fall right out. If you have dental pockets or hard to reach places this will clean and make your breath fresher. The 1st week can be tough and your gums will most likely bleed especially if you do not floss on the regular. Just start at the lowest setting and work your way up to a setting that is comfortable. The kit comes with 2 cups one for water and the other if you need to measure out medicine or any other type of liquid that requires dilution. I use mouthwash in the smaller cup and peroxide with water once a week in the large cup. The only issue that I don&#x27;t like is that it can be a little loud where using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than the newer versions and quite a bit noisier, but I tend to drain the reservoir on the new models before I&#x27;m done cleaning my teeth. That&#x27;s the main reason I prefer the classic model. It gets the job done, doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg, and the last one lasted me at least five years with no replacement parts required.</li>
    <li> Better than flossing.</li>
    <li> does the job, is very powerful, so be ware of gum soreness at times</li>
    <li> This is my second Waterpik.  The last one broke at the brush near the hosing.  This is a great value and small and easy to store on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
    <li> Works as expected, except it is rather noisy. The similar model I had was not as loud and it stopped pumping after about 3 years continuous use by 2 people. I upgraded to the pro model.</li>
    <li> I found it to be a little on the loud side.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this one and the WP-100.  I prefer this one because the jet seems more powerful and because the tank is larger (meaning, for me, one tank of water is all that&#x27;s needed for a single session).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have given it five stars, but it is only a couple months old and seems to already be losing some of its power (though it&#x27;s still better than my old WP-100).</li>
    <li> This is the more powerful of the waterpik models.  Precisely what we wanted.  Even my dentist is thrilled with the results.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my older WaterPik unit which lasted over 10 years. I highly recommend it for getting great dental cleaning evaluations. It does not replace regular flossing but, if used once daily as a habit, it can greatly enhance the health of your teeth and gums. Water pressure is adjustable so you just find the level that is comfortable to you.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted to replace my older model Waterpik. Before I purchased this model I tried the Cordless Flosser from Waterpik. After two uses I returned it as the reservoir did not hold enough and the handle was just too large.This classic model has a giant reservoir and a wand. It also has several pressure setting. I love it!</li>
    <li> VERY NOISY... I use the larger container for a mixture of water and antiseptic mouth wash. I wish there was a cover to protect the solution for the 3 days it takes me to use it. Right now, I have a elasticized food cover (looks like a small shower cap) over the top of the unit for a dust cover. This entire unit  is a terrible design. If you have arthritis in your fingers, the wand delivery button is hard to keep pushed in. I&#x27;m just disappointed and disgusted with it. Problem is, I bought two - one for me and one for my husband.  I&#x27;m going to attempt to return it.  UPDATE:  product return was very easy. I selected the option that I didn&#x27;t need/want any more. I now have a return label and all I have to do is drop the units off ay my local UPS store. I do love Amazon for their customer support. BTW - I ordered two different model units because I do like the Waterpik brand. Stay tuned for my next review.</li>
    <li> The last WaterPic I bought was about 8 years ago.  I retired it because I stopped using it every day and it grew algae inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hand surgery a few months ago and found that I could not use dental floss during my recovery.  So I shelled out the bigger bucks for a new Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This model works much better than the old my old one.  I like that the pressure control is on the handle rather than on the pump.  This allows me to change the pressure without needing to concentrate on more than one thing at a time.</li>
    <li> bought this to remove a few tonsil stones... took just a few squirts of this machine to remove stones from my tonsils... it&#x27;s messy and machine shakes a ton, but it got rid of those lil buggers really easily.</li>
    <li> A bit noisy but does an excellent job of flossing...better than floss!</li>
    <li> We had one for a number of years and have wanted another one especially this style.  It is a very necessary implement to further the health of your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> It replaces on I have had for probably 30 years. The only problem is attaching the reservoir to the base is not always easy.</li>
    <li> To messy and to much work.....guess I&#x27;m lazy</li>
    <li> I like this waterpik very much.  I was having a problem and my dentist thought a waterpik would be good to use.  It  seems to be soveing my problem.</li>
    <li> Dental tape works well, but this handy machine seems to clean better between teeth. Now that Ive had several crowns the spaces between teeth are larger and I&#x27;m finding  my gums receding a bit and more food particles are getting &#x27;tween and around. The waterpik does a better clean out than flossing.</li>
    <li> This replacement for my older model water pick has some improved features.  very satisfied.</li>
    <li> its a very important part of anyone&#x27;s oral hygiene regimen. it completely cleans in between teeth and gum to remove unwanted plaque and food residues.  the benefit is immediately noticeable in the first use! I love this product. I been using this for many years now since my orthodontist had recommended it. I strongly recommended this product to anyone specially the ones that are wearing braces. I can never live without this product. btw, its an awesome weapon during water squirt gun battle with the kids!</li>
    <li> First impressions: nicely packaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros: Keeps my tooths and gums nice and clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: Takes up quite a bit of counter room ( wouldn&#x27;t dare knock a star for this though )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the Money / Would I buy this item again?: Yes</li>
    <li> great product. Right size</li>
    <li> I had a hand held water pik. It finaly died, so I wanted to try a plug in unit. I bought this one based on reviews. FANTASTIC!!!! I just got braces on, and this water pik is absolutley the best. Great water pressure that you control, multiple flossers to choose from per your needs. Great water pik, could not be happier with this product. If flooking for a great water pik/flosser, look no further, this is the one!</li>
    <li> My previous waterpik was a 1973 model and finally needed to be replaced.  I found this one and I am so pleased with the way it works. The new design is easy to use and has some nice features that my older one did not have.  Looking for this to be around for a good many years also.</li>
    <li> I had one of these when I was growing up - I don&#x27;t remember it being so loud. I wish the stream were more steady instead of burst-y. It does make your teeth feel so clean, though.</li>
    <li> This is a far better water flosser than the last one I had.  My only issue is the power settings.  I have to use it on the lowest setting because anything higher than that feels like it&#x27;s cutting into my gums.  I can only imagine how strong the highest setting is!  Otherwise, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great product...Fast delivery!!!  :)</li>
    <li> I love his Waterpik.  It cleans my mouth thoroughly and leaves my teeth feeling like I just got out of the dentist&#x27;s chair.</li>
    <li> This waterpik replaced an older one which had to be discarded only because of a pulled water tube. The new one is harder to fit on the water gasket, and thus to take off and empty. It also does not have a top cover as the older one did, leaving it open to collect dust and foreign matter. Except for this, it still does a good job of flossing the teeth.</li>
    <li> The waterpik performs very well.  I had a little trouble getting it started, called their customer service, prompt response, got it going with no problem.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, hard to fit water container......</li>
    <li> This is great for people with gum disease, it cleans below the gum line. You will wish you had gotten this sooner.</li>
    <li> the power of the water pik is good, it definitely cleans my teeth better than any other method, but the actually product is faulty- it leaks water when its not in use and you end up with a puddle on the floor</li>
    <li> We had the waterpik with the blue reservoir and it had started to lose power, so we bought this one.  We love the larger reservoir and the powerful water flow.  We do smoothies for lunch with lots of fresh fruit, so there are a lot of seeds and skins to deal with.  This unit blasts them out and keeps our gums in great shape--we love it!</li>
    <li> My hygienist recommended this as I&#x27;m fanatical about keeping my teeth healthy.  As an order person it makes sense to keep both teeth and gums stimulated and clean.  It takes just a few minutes and is simple and easy.</li>
    <li> I have felt this waterpik is excellent and now have one for both my summer and winter homes and would recommend Amazon for their quick service and cost.</li>
    <li> Glad to have it, but it&#x27;s bulky to handle.</li>
    <li> Good item, well packaged, My dentist will love that I have and use this.</li>
    <li> Worked well beyond my expectation!  Why I waited so long is a mystery to me.  Would like to say that the unit is wonderful, the noise is somewhat annoying.  Still a small issue, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this at the suggestion of my ENT doctor to clean my sinuses, it works with a separate attachment, but it also cleans your teeth sparkly clean, amazing!</li>
    <li> Better than the previous versions. This one has softer faster pulses like a small hammer rapidly pounding, versus the old on that was like a slow sledge hammer.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing, I never got used to it, and did it so rarely that I couldn&#x27;t even claim that I ever flossed. Enter the Waterpik which eliminates the whole cumbersome &amp;#34;get string stuck between my teeth&amp;#34; issue and turns it into a simple thing that I do after brushing, and my dentist has commented that my teeth are looking much better (much reduced plaque issues), so all I can say is that I wish I had had this thing decades ago. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I DO NOT recommend this Waterpik to anyone!! It is loud, clumsy and awkward. AWFUL!!  I have not ever ordered anything that I didn&#x27;t like, but this is a sure LEMON!! You will not be happy with this thing. It&#x27;s too big and the big water container does not fit well on the machine. Look for another.</li>
    <li> I think this is a very good product and I use it faithfully! It is just what the advertisement says it is.</li>
    <li> Same as one i had for past 10 years. it seems a little stiff to aleign top to bottom but works well.</li>
    <li> First time owning a waterpik, great for cleaning your teeth. Take note that you will get very wet if you do not know how to direct water out of your mouth like a fountain. Don&#x27;t put in on the highest setting, it can hurt.</li>
    <li> This is the CLASSIC model..Holds a LOT of water. Over the years they have been replacing this classic model with a sleeker looking version, but I always had to fill up the reservoir twice to get the job done. I&#x27;ve used this product since the 70&#x27;s and credit it with maintaining my big healthy smile for as many decades. My dentist always remarks on how white my teeth are and how healthy my mouth and gums are. This product is a BIG reason why. When I&#x27;ve traveled overseas, usually gone for 2-3 weeks, I only take a portable waterpik with me. Does not do the job the Classic model does and my gums will bleed a little for a week or two when I come back and use my home &#x27;powerwasher&#x27;. Toughens them up and keeps them healthy while getting out EVERYTHING hiding between your teeth and in any bridgework. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> Works great and looks nice.</li>
    <li> The crystal clear container doesn&#x27;t connect with the bottom part well. There is less power also. Disappoint about the quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 20 years. I&#x27;ve purchased more than 10 of these for friends, family and personal use.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Waterpik cleans teeth and the gaps between teeth gently and thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;-There are several water speed settings that are available for adjustment according to personal preference&lt;br /&gt;-simple to clean&lt;br /&gt;-well built product that lasts (I&#x27;ve only had to purchase new ones for myself when I&#x27;ve moved abroad)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I wish they would come out with a redesign that would make this unit smaller or better looking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve tried the travel and smaller sizes and they just didn&#x27;t do the job. This model works the best.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son who just got braces.  He finds it easy to use and very effective.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, functions well.  Exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> I have used a waterpik for many, many years.  Would not be without it!  This is an updated model to the one I had before.  It is much improved from the older model.  It is lighter and quieter.  And I love the crystal water holder that doubles as a cover for travel.</li>
    <li> The best device I ever used to clean below the gum line.  It will make my dentist very happy and I will save my teeth!</li>
    <li> I really wish there was a button for when I&#x27;m using it to pause the stream, it can be quite messy but it is effective</li>
    <li> Been using a Waterpik for MANY years.  Great for dental hygiene.  Recommend it for anyone who wants to keep their teeth and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> I love beef and turkey jerky, but it was driving me crazy getting between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Water Pic has been around for years and I know it has a great reputation for having good products, so I chose the water flosser.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  I mix water with just a little mouth wash and clean my teeth with this after brushing.  It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve done for myself in years.</li>
    <li> I have used waterpiks for many years now and have liked the results. This one works very well but is noisier than any I have had in the past. I like the design of this one better than any in the past (except for the noise).</li>
    <li> I had a Water Pik that was probably 20 years old and the plastic became so brittle it began to break apart - I ordered this Classic Professional Water Flosser and I like it rather well - I only wish the piks came out of the holder easier.  With arthritis, it is hard to remove the piks after using, therefore I am only giving this 4 stars.</li>
    <li> As described, Quality and Shipment.</li>
    <li> Warranty much appreciated.  This Water Pik is one of the few on the market that does a great job if used daily to keep gums healthy.</li>
    <li> My dentist was threatening to take drastic measures because my gums wouldn&#x27;t stop bleeding, told me I either needed to pick up a waterpik or start flossing all day long. I picked this up and I LOVE IT! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Replaces my old Waterpik that died.  I get good checkups at the dentist and quit having issues with receding gum line.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik works much better for me than flossing!  I use this model daily and can&#x27;t imagine having to do without it.  If you have any dental or gum problems, you might want to get your dentist&#x27;s input before using it.  For anyone with a healthy mouth, regular use with this product should help keep it that way.</li>
    <li> 2nd unit for the cottage. The old one is 15 years old and running fine. This appears to almost be its equal. So far no problems. I empty and clean the container after each use, unplug it and put it in the vanity. I&#x27;ve always used a cap of mouthwash in the container, which so far has not affected them at all.</li>
    <li> Why would this be made without a lid? I just don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works amazing (if a bit loud). I love the small tip for tight spaces</li>
    <li> Use it every day at night before I brush my teeth.  The best water flosser on the market, very reasonable priced, no bells or whistles but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Powerful! I have three teenage boys with braces, and brushing and flossing alone were not getting the job done. This water flosser has been a great addition to their brushing routines. We have a different colored tip for each boy to eliminate confusion.</li>
    <li> this is my second purchase of this same waterpik,, been using for years love it.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on the promised date.  It performs as expected.  I have had it a couple of months and have had no problems or issues</li>
    <li> Only cons:&lt;br /&gt;- If there&#x27;s water in the reservoir and you take the tip off the handle to store it, and put the handle in the storage holder, the water all leaks out. Very poor design.&lt;br /&gt;- The handle is so flimsy and light it&#x27;s hard to hold in one place with the pressure turned on. Very cheap construction.</li>
    <li> Nice. Returned quite a few of the water picks before trying this one and its a keeper.</li>
    <li> Works well and a good deal with fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It takes some getting used to but the first time I used it as disgusting as it sounds I have never seen so much black stuff come out from between my teeth. I don&#x27;t really take care of my teeth as well as I should but if you want to do more for your teeth and hate regular flossing because of how painful and how much blood you end up seeing this is worth the price. Honestly its as good as any $60 or $70 ones but for much cheaper. If you&#x27;re worried that it has no top for the water container don&#x27;t even worry about it. I normally fill it up almost spilling and have never spilled a drop even while its on. Its basic features are the on/off switch and two buttons on the handle itself. Its got a stop/go for water flow button and a 1-5 strength of water button. Usually I stay at the first but use the 3 when I really want some kick. I now use this every day and if you just want the basic device with only whats necessary then this is the one you want. Would recommend 100% any day. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks now but I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;One last thing is if you use a high setting it still might make you bleed but every time I used actual floss I bled multiple times from multiple places and with this i only bleed once in a while from one area for like 5 seconds.</li>
    <li> This Waterpix was a great price as well as product. I carry this flosser with me when ever I travel. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Very effective and not too pricey.</li>
    <li> works great and would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this Waterpik. I had to replace my previous one because the hand piece or whatever it&#x27;s called broke. I didn&#x27;t know I could replace just the part so I pitched it. The settings are nice and give me the right amount of pressure to get a great clean. The highest setting is too harsh, which I was happy about because I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be a strong enough jet. Hope it lasts. No reason for the small reservoir, seems like a waste of time but I use it to fill my humidifier so worked out fine!</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with food lodging between my teeth and gums for years. It usually got so bad, a trip to the dentist was necessary and I might add very expensive. This first time I used this product I could see and feel immediate results. My teeth and gums have never felt better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Waterpik guy. I&#x27;ve been using Waterpiks since the 1970s and can&#x27;t be without one at any time. I take full size waterpiks with me when I travel. But I believe the machines aren&#x27;t the same quality they once were. I bought the latest model to replace a 6 month old WP65 - now relegated to travel duties - in hopes it has a better pump. The old machines reservoir emptied in 90 seconds when it was new in December. It now takes 184 seconds. Yes, I timed them. I trashed the previous Waterpik that I had because it was taking almost 5 minutes to empty and it was less than two years old. The only solution I use in my Waterpik is a quarter cup of hydrogen peroxide added to the water. Has anyone else noticed this problem? I love my Waterpik but this is getting expensive.</li>
    <li> This is way better than the waterpik I had as a kid with braces. It&#x27;s powerful, and the gum attachment makes it great for getting under the gums with whatever solution you choose (I use hydrogen peroxide). With regular use you might put your hygienist out of business.</li>
    <li> Go for the extra couple of dollars for the Aquarius model. I have both, and there&#x27;s a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Works well and I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;enjoy the fresh feeling in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Works well, but is very loud.  Read the directions before using.  I thought the unit was leaking, but then I realized you need to empty the water reservoir after using.  I would give it five starts, but it&#x27;s LOUD!</li>
    <li> The Water Pik did not provide the results I expected.  First, it is extremely messy with water getting sprayed all over the bathroom.  Second, it did not seem to clean as I understood it would.  I think flossing might be more effective, although more painful.</li>
    <li> pressure good, on and off switch awkward, so is pik holder.</li>
    <li> First time for me and my wife using a water flosser and we must say it really works. The only negative is the noise it makes.</li>
    <li> Good Product Good protection Good Delivery</li>
    <li> For the price, this unit provides the best water reservoir and power needed to get a great cleaning job on teeth.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
    <li> The best - finally have the power I was looking for.  Easy to clean, too!</li>
    <li> I had an old style Water Pik for decades. There were finally no replacement nozzles available to order for it. I was looking for a replacement and finally decided on this unit. It is almost exactly like the classic that I loved! Except, that it comes with a periodontal tip in case you need that (dentist or periodontic specialist recommended usage only), two water containers so that you can use specialized rinses or hydrogen peroxide in a cost effective way (one is a much smaller volume), and the biggest benefit for me is that it is one-third as noisy as the old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice that I said one-third as noisy!! That means no one would call this unit quiet, but at least with a hand-towel underneath it and the door closed between the bathroom and bedroom, it does not wake up my spouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!! If you have never used a Water-Pik before, please read the instructions and start at the least aggressive pressure setting so that you do not hurt your gums. After using it for a few weeks, you will probably be delighted by how healthy your mouth feels and tastes !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. The large water container does flip upside down and fit securely over the unit to keep it looking neater with tips, handle and water tube  covered and in place between uses.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist said to find a waterpik without too many bells and whistles.  Good advice for me -- I like simple useful tools.  I like this a lot better than flossing.  Duh.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from CVS and I am impressed by how efficient and quick in comparison to a floss. As a braces patient, it helps me floss really quick. Before I bought this product, it would take me 1 hour to floss due to the wire but, now I floss in 1-5 minutes. This saved me alot of valuable time. I also have a mild case of gingivitis and flossing makes me bleed every time. With this, the first few use may bleed but, after a few times, the bleeding gets less and less. My bleeding proves how efficient it is as I would bleed naturally with a floss. But, I am quite disappointed with the disruptive sound. I am a busy person from morning to afternoon and the only times I can floss are in the morning and at night. This product makes a very loud noise as if my house was under construction. I recommend getting the newer versions.</li>
    <li> This basic model works very well. I see no reason to spend more for more expensive models.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it!</li>
    <li> It is ok just a little messy.</li>
    <li> Despite admonitions from my dentist, I&#x27;ve never been very consistent about flossing my teeth. As a result, I&#x27;ve developed something called &amp;#34;periodontal pockets,&amp;#34; which are apparently a bad thing if they get too deep. A few months ago, the dentist recommended that I get a Waterpik. I&#x27;ve been using it every day, and at my last checkup, the pockets were improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, the Waterpik looks a bit complicated, but it&#x27;s actually very simple to use. I had to get used to having to spit out a mouthful of water every few seconds while pausing the spray, but that wasn&#x27;t very hard. This model includes two of the &amp;#34;classic jet tips,&amp;#34; which the instructions recommend replacing every six months, and one pik pocket tip (for periodontal pockets and furcations), which are recommended to be replaced every three months. I&#x27;ve been using the regular jet tip, but if I need to, I&#x27;ll go with the pik pocket tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting old, and I would like to keep my own teeth till I die, and it looks like the Waterpik is helping me meet that goal.</li>
    <li> First of all, this is very loud. Second of all, mine seemed to have very little control.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to regular flossing, thanks.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my adult son that is having issues with his gums. He now uses this water flosser every evening, and says that it really cleans his teeth and gums. His wife started using it also.  My sister-in-law (dental hygienist) said the water flossers worked better than the air flossers, on teeth, so I purchased this  water flosser based on her recommendation. BW, Irvine</li>
    <li> This is a great product. To be honest this is my 3rd one.  I have problems with my gums bleeding.  If I use the waterpik at least 3 times a week, my gums get stronger and don&#x27;t bleed.  The dentist kept threatening to make me come in 4 times a year for cleaning due to the bleeding.  The waterpik solved the problems.  I would recommend this to anyone that has trouble with their gums.</li>
    <li> My waterpik works great, just what my dentist wanted</li>
    <li> It does the job of cleaning the areas of your teeth which are hard to get into with brush or floss. However, I wish they had a cover for the water bucket. Also, the operation of the water-pik is not smooth and takes some getting used to. It is important to exactly follow their instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the instructions do not clearly show which of the two flosser tubes are to be used for which use.</li>
    <li> Just like my old one that lasted 20 years. It definitely improves my oral health, especially gums.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpick flossers for years.  They have cleared more junk out of my teeth even after flossing with regular floss.  The hygienist at the dentist is always amazed at how clean I keep my teeth.  This results from brushing, waterpicking and flossing.  The only problem is that the hose on the Waterpick will last anywhere from 3 to 5 years before it breaks and loses pressure.  I have found no way to fix the hose as the Waterpick is glued together and if it is taken apart it would be hell to put it back together.  Easier to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> A disappointment to me. Works okay but the noise sounds like a jack hammer at my ear as the cord isn&#x27;t long. The last one I had leaked water all over, this one doesn&#x27;t but the noise is too much and I wouldn&#x27;t buy this model again. Why does it have to be so noisy?</li>
    <li> Came on time and works as described. My wife refused to floss before we got this and she finds it a great alternative to conventional flossing. She hasn&#x27;t experienced any bleeding which she did with regular flossing. I was an avid flossed with conventional floss before I started using this. I found it to be just as good as regular floss if not better. Its defiantly faster than flossing normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only draw back is it slightly loud, could wake your partner up in the morning if your bathroom is attached to your bed as ours is.</li>
    <li> this is an item we&#x27;ve used for years and it does a decent job on the teeth and gums.I don&#x27;t believe it takes the place of flossing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it every night.  It cleans a LOT of debris out of between my teeth.</li>
    <li> What a great design -- I have had other sizes before - this smaller one fits on counter better, and works just as well. I love the design; easy to clean reservoir.</li>
    <li> My husband and I really like this and feel it is doing a great job.  Am glad my dentist suggested that I purchase it.  I had the smaller battery charged one and this one is far superior.</li>
    <li> My Mom needed to replace her old Waterpik so I got her this. Mom says it works great, much like her old one which gave her years of good service. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how it works, I only ever used it for a squirt gun.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik model has a very strong source of water and cleans all of the food lodging in your teeth.  Would recommend this highly!</li>
    <li> I had the WaterPik ultra or mega, or whatever, and didn&#x27;t like it much.  Once the flimsy bracket that held the wand broke off, it was next to impossible to store the unit between uses.  I got this Classic version to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has a bigger capacity tank, has a nice and compact profile when assembled for storage, and the overall construction is a bit sturdier.  Both units do a good job of flossing, however, the ergonomics and sturdiness of the classic model are far superior.</li>
    <li> I have had many different water piks, but this one is the best.  Great buy as well.  If you want a water flosser this is your best bet.</li>
    <li> It works. Water jet does clean between your teeth. However, the machine could have had a better design. The ON/OFF switch is not placed on the part you hold but on the main unit...weird. And, the water tank does not have a lid...weird again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law and she is very pleased with it.  It replaced an old one she had</li>
    <li> This pik is very noisy compared to my old one.  It is hard for me to line up the &amp;#34;plugs&amp;#34; for it to pump the water for whatever reason.  It IS quite forceful and adjusting the wand itself while the water is pumping is almost a comedy of errors.  I am rather disappointed in this model since I had the Ultra pik from years ago and really enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> This product has been redesigned from the version we had before. While it works effectively (I would not be without a waterpik now--I get great reports from my dentist!), there are some things you should know before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the wand is difficult to insert into the wand holder. You are supposed to push the ring down, insert the wand, and then the ring is supposed to pop back into place, locking the wand for use. If it doesn&#x27;t pop back up or pushed back up, water will leak out at the end of the holder and you will not get a pressurized stream from the wand tip. It sometimes takes a full minute to coax the wand into locking position. I consider this a design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the construction seems kind of cheap compared to its predecessors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the water tank has a frosted interior for reasons unknown to me. I&#x27;ve noticed that if the tank isn&#x27;t cleaned frequently, bacteria build up (an orange film is the tipoff). I think this is because the frosted surface gives bacteria a better foothold than a smooth surface would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, it&#x27;s fairly noisy (noisier than previous model) in operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upsides: Bigger tank capacity, larger selection of pressures (switch is now on the wand holder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while it&#x27;s unsatisfactory in some respects, it is still an essential oral hygiene item.</li>
    <li> This is a great machine, and I have a lot positive to say about it, but there is one negative that causes it to lose a complete two stars! This machine can be a bit loud, which is a little bit of a turn off, but how else are you going to pump water at a high pressure? The ends fit on well, and there are plenty. All the way from broad and soft, to what I call &amp;#34;Murder your gums&amp;#34; are the levels that these tips go. The basin fills enough water for a quick once over, but you&#x27;ll have to fill it twice if you are on a flossing mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great news is that flossing with this machine is much easier than conventional flossing methods. Choking your fingers by wrapping floss around your fingers seems terribly archaic. I&#x27;m not a savage. The floss picks are great, but even they are hard to get back in the back, and you tend to leave them around, which is gross. This machine makes all of that easier, and according to my dentist is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big problem that I have with this machine is the button to engage the pump. It is extremely difficult to keep the button engaged and you just feel like you&#x27;re mashing a button to try to keep it going. It is nothing short of a terrible design for the button, and the button alone.</li>
    <li> Have not tried it because we did not get the pics that were suppose to be included.</li>
    <li> This is my first Waterpik and it really is a nice tool for good oral hygiene. Now I know why dentists have been recommending this for me for years. I would give it 5 stars if it could eliminate my having to use dental floss. This does not entirely replace the use of dental floss; Dental floss is still needed to remove the hardened (plaque-like) accumulation on teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this new Waterpik because I can use the standard tip to easily remove most food debris from between my teeth and the higher pressure tip to remove the remaining particles and a lot of the \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; film and finally stimulate my gums. I am happy with the ease of use and results making my final dental flossing easier for my arthritic hands/fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Be prepared for a force of water..Follow the directions and you should be able to use it immediately without pressure-washing your bathroom walls &amp; mirror. Also, it&#x27;s a bit noisy and vibrates some...Place on solid secure surface.</li>
    <li> It works great the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I find it a real inconvenience to flip the reservoir over to cover the inside from dust. Truly needs a cover like their other model but for the price of $35.00 instead of $45.00 you can&#x27;t beat it !</li>
    <li> Cleans beautifully.  Only problem is it&#x27;s difficult to place the water holder onto the base correctly.</li>
    <li> its good. My teeth feel much better now. but it is so loud when working</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I bought died on the second try - and the second one I bought, well, I haven&#x27;t given it a second try.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, but repairing cracked tubing remains difficult (this is my third or fourth Waterpik).&lt;br /&gt;For my dental issues, I can&#x27;t do without it.&lt;br /&gt;This version vibrates a little less, so I don&#x27;t have to hold it down with my other hand. There&#x27;s an&lt;br /&gt;annoying delay before water pulses out. And it&#x27;s still hard to hang up the emitter when the&lt;br /&gt;water reservoir is in place. Should be cheaper: it&#x27;s a pulsating pump, a motor, some tubing, and&lt;br /&gt;some other plastic, and it&#x27;s been decades since the the early patents.</li>
    <li> We were looking for a decently priced water flosser from Amazon and saw this had very decent reviews. I am telling you to reconsider:    - Its quite loud (like a miniature sub-pump)  - It vibrates tremendously (making it difficult to operate efficiently)  - The controls (especially the spout \\&quot;pause\\&quot; which essentially just blocks the water from leaving the spout which is hard to mash and is poorly designed)  - There is no lid for the reservoirs which is fine for use, but if left over time, you might be flossing your teeth with dust-bunnies  - Since the only way to keep water coming through the spout aside from the god-awful \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button, the water either sprays through uncontrollably through the spout which its ON, and drips out constantly when its OFF; basic physics  - The water spews out in motion with the motor, therefore is not constant, but more as a vibration    I hope this helps in your endeavor; I&#x27;ll update on other choices since we&#x27;re returning this IMMEDIATELY!    UPDATE: Oct 31 2014- so after a couple days, we are soon to send back..we thought we might give it a few more tries. Again, the issues above are about the same. The only thing is that it DOES take a lot of practice and accepting these issues to make it work. You have to be very close over the sink not to make a mess, but it makes sense that if there&#x27;s a lot of pressure, there could be a big mess no matter what. Be careful setting the pressure level too high; I cut the bottom of my mouth with it at &#x27;max&#x27; so watch out! The &#x27;pause&#x27; button is hard to get used to shutting it off, but again it takes practice.    We&#x27;re still sending back regardless, only for the fact that we can probably find a suitable &#x27;shower&#x27; version that it won&#x27;t matter the messiness but that the water pressure, though less, will still suffice for our needs + a fog mirror).    Good luck and hope this was helpful!  Best of luck!</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommened this and it works well. Keeps you from those dreaded dentures.lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several for family, you cannot have tooth decay without bacteria, and the Water Flosser effectively eliminates &#x27;em.  I&#x27;ve been cavity free for three years, and it&#x27;s because I floss, brush thrice, and use the Water Flosser.  As an old guy, with recession, oral cleanliness becomes so much more important.  I&#x27;d like to keep all my teeth, ya know?</li>
    <li> This is a product with great value for its price. I purchased it from Greece, so I paid three times its price (including taxes, shipping costs and a voltage converter) but it&#x27;s still worth it, it gets the job done. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks and I have to say that I&#x27;ve never felt my teeth so clean. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit noisey. Yes, it&#x27;s made from plastic. But if you hate flossing as much as I do, this is the most affordable way to kiss it goodbye forever.</li>
    <li> This Waterpik is almost identical to our old one, which died after 10 years. Works like a charm and helps us keep our teeth and gums in good shape. There are only two drawbacks: It is noisy as all get out, and the little spot where you park the hose and nozzle isn&#x27;t quite right, so the nozzle is always falling off. Small price to pay for such an inexpensive item. Guess that function is more important to me than form most of the time. It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> very poor water control handle !!!!</li>
    <li> Works better than my previous one</li>
    <li> the waterpik is easy to use and a great replacement.  I have used a waterpik for 20 years and my old one finally died.  So, I go a replacement.  It seems to be the same great quality as the old one.  I am hoping for another 20 years for both it and me.  Seriously, I consistently get excellent checkups when I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Just switched to this unit after using the hand held battery operating unit for several years. At first, coming from the cordless battery operated unit I was used to not dealing with a hose and the bulkiness of the battery operated unit was nice for holding onto and directing the spray. But transitioning to the smaller &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; hasn&#x27;t been too difficult an adjustment. Especially considering the payoffs are many including not having to wait for batteries to charge (or forgetting to charge it), not refilling every 30 seconds and having multiple and more powerful settings to use. This unit can be messy with the small wand and high volume of water flow. But the pause button works as I would expect it to. Also, the cleaning I&#x27;m getting is worth being careful of making a mess. I generally have a large slop sink in my laundry room where its a perfect place to use my water pick. Hopefully this unit will last for years to come as my last battery operated unit lasted just over 2 years. Also, even though it lasted a 2 years sometimes it would get really finicky. Working fine one day and other days barely putting out pressure. Sometimes it even seemed like besides not having enough time to charge, it seemed like letting it charge too long was also not good. Just never quite knew how it would act on a given day? Having continuous power with this model should never be an issue again. As far as the noise is concerned it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;ll trade noise for continuous and good power and a large water basin any day.  EDIT 12/24/15. Unit started leaking from base 13 months after getting it. It was still operational. However, lost pressure and spraying water from base. I took the unit apart and made it so it wasn&#x27;t leaking as bad (at least not spraying water from base anymore) and was still somewhat usable. Had less pressure and left a puddle after use. I went to Waterpiks website and submitted a warranty claim since unit has a 2 year warranty. Waterpik honored the warranty acouple days later and within a week and sent me a brand new WP-72 no questions asked and without returning the broken unit. Still very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is the third one I&#x27;ve owned over the years.  All are about the same, really.  They do a great job.  My only complaint with this one is that the settings seem touchier than in the past.</li>
    <li> lil loud but work fine for me</li>
    <li> Works well with plenty of power, which I like.  I use only the 2nd or 3rd most powerful of the 5 settings.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff,i use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with product</li>
    <li> Works exactly the same as the old Waterpik that I had for about a decade.  The new, clear water reservoir is an improvement.  My old one had the opaque reservoir, and it would get some pink mold/algae/bacteria/yeast (whatever it is) stuff growing in the corners without a regular scrubbing.  The new one doesn&#x27;t have that problem, it&#x27;s fine with just a rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you&#x27;re debating one of the cordless &amp;#34;irrigator&amp;#34; products, be aware that while their PSI levels may be high, they&#x27;re extremely unlikely to push out anywhere near the volume as the Waterpik Classic.  In other words, you&#x27;ll blast plaque and food just as hard, but you won&#x27;t actually wash it away as well.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this faithfully.  Helps removes particles that the toothbrush and flossing doesn&#x27;t.  She&#x27;s really happy with it!  Highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> My gums are so much healthier since I started using this water flosser.  I can feel how much better my mouth is using this twice a day.  Once a day with plain water and then once a day with 1 cap full of any mouth wash/rinse and then fill the cup with plain water.  I use warm to hot to the touch tap, it feels so much better on my sensitive gums, the first time I used cold water and the pain was so intense, shooting icy cold water into those crevices hurt.</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers have previously noted, the pressure is quite intense.  Also, you have to master the technique of having the water flow out of your mouth like a waterfall during use, which will be messy at first.  It is worth the purchase if you hate flossing like my family does, but I do wish the water container came with a lid like the more expensive models have.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the classic one that I have used for years and that failed in a couple of years of use. I don&#x27;t know why folks complain about how loud it is. This unit is the quietest one I have ever know and it works better than any of the &amp;#34;classic ones?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so important for oral care.</li>
    <li> Good product; good price</li>
    <li> Works well and the button doesn&#x27;t get stuck like our previous waterpik model.</li>
    <li> I considered this one and the portable one and I&#x27;m glad that I purchased this one. Its extremely powerful and I have to refill the tank 1 or 2 times to finish flossing, so I can&#x27;t imagine how many times i would have to refill the portable ones small tank. It also comes with 3 water heads that I find pretty useful. I have braces and the heads included seem to clean  pretty well. I saw that there is one specifically for braces that you can order but the included heads do just fine. Personally it was inconvenient to floss with string before I had braces and a total pain after I got them, this give me no excuse. I just shoot it in between each tooth, along the gum line and over the braces and I&#x27;m good to go. Sometimes I&#x27;m surprised at how much stuff comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many people have commented, this thing is very powerful. I&#x27;m able to use it on full blast now, but you definitely have to work your way up to that or else you will blast holes in your gums. It took me a week or two before I was able to use it on  the highest setting. There was a little gum bleeding when I first started using it, but after a few uses my gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore and they are really nice and pink. I have a dentist cleaning next month so I am curious to see what they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only dislike about this flosser is that its very loud. You definitely couldn&#x27;t use it while your significant other is in the room sleeping. It seems to get a little quieter the more you use it but its still kind of loud. Some people also complained that it should have come with a lid to cover the tank. The tank inverts and fits over the base. I find that it saves a little more space on my countertop. I just wipe any water droplets out of the tank and off the base to avoid mold/mildew and cover the base with the inverted tank and its all safely stored away free from flying debris and dust.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Effective.  The container used to hold water comes in two sizes and both are included.  My advice is to watch a video on youtube on how to use a water pic and you will like this inexpensive product. Be near a sink and wipe up after use.  Let it air dry after ust with hose hanging in downward direction.</li>
    <li> No problems at all so far.  I read lots of reviews on different water flossers.  None of them had perfect reviews, so was somewhat expecting a possible disappointment, but it&#x27;s been great.  I have a deep area behind my back molar that regular flossing just doesn&#x27;t do the trick with, but since using a waterpic, I have no more swelling and my gums feel healthier.</li>
    <li> Both this for a gift and the recipient loved it!</li>
    <li> Had it for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;Still works great, and great for your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;Great value.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it!</li>
    <li> 12/2016 Still working well.&lt;br /&gt;OK, so this is my first water flosser. I don&#x27;&#x27;t know if the water pressure is good, or if the ease of use is as good as other units...all I know is that I LOVE THE THING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have on occasion tried to floss and never could get it to adequately clean between my teeth, and it never felt good after I did it.&lt;br /&gt;BUT THIS water flosser, I KNOW it gets between my teeth clean, AND I can see my swollen gums receeding, and the tenderness going!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus there are some additives you can add to the water that make your mouth feel even better!  Some that claim to be able to take the calculus off underneath the gum line so you don&#x27;t have to have a DEEP cleaning by the dentist...which hurts and costs...and you bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WISH I HAD BEEN USING ONE ALL MY LIFE, I am sure my teeth would be as good as new if I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I disliked my dentist, but instead of finding a new one; I just stopped going...for 5 years!  No cleanings for 5 years.  Finally I found another and got a cleaning. They said my teeth did not look as though they had not had a dental cleaning for 5 years but much better. Don&#x27;t know if it is the Water Pic or the additives, but thought I would pass it on.</li>
    <li> I wonder if you can get too much of a good thing? This thing has a HUGE reservoir! I tend to fill it up to over 1000 of those liquid  metric things and go to town (ml&#x27;s?). My teeth never felt so good and my dentist is extremely happy. He said my gums have never looked this good.</li>
    <li> A great  A 3 in 1 product, who could ask for more. I use it daily as a floss and mouthwash.  I would recommend this waterpik.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> Great product with excellent results. Only wish we had one and used it consistently for the last 30 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;Tank leaks overstated and what we found is that with water in the tank, if you leave the handle below the level of the water, it will drain until the tank is empty. Maybe they could put the tank on the bottom and holder on top?</li>
    <li> works good...hoping to get many months of use even though appears to be made cheap but at the price a good buy.</li>
    <li> Have used one of these daily before brushing (with soft brush) for many years as I hate to floss. It is especially great for blasting leftovers from under bridges and dislodging meat stuck in hard to floss places. The old one (must have been 10-15 years old) lost velocity and was starting to get kind of funky. My dentist used to preach flossing all the time and sells expensive power toothbrushes (which I pass on). Now he says &amp;#34;whatever you are doing, keep doing it.&amp;#34; Minimal plaque and very healthy gums. Forget power toothbrushes and other fancy expensive gadgets.</li>
    <li> Wish  I had gotten this when I still had all my teeth.  I like it much more than flossing, and therefore use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Very noisy!!! Does not come with a lid. Would be perfect if it was quiet when operated.</li>
    <li> This has good consistent pressure and large reservoir, it is a  bit loud and difficult to put the pick in and out of the unit, they should have left the corner over the pick open and not tried to get three more table spoons of water in the reservoir, then it would be easy to load and unload the wand (pick). This has been an on going issue, the first version did not have a wand holder, second had a good one in front, this one has one but hidden under the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;the pulse  action is great on this one, really cleans without having to use maximum pressure setting. I recommend this product, if you have never used a water pick, you do not know what you are missing.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Wow!  A power-washer for the teeth!</li>
    <li> Leaks a little but works very well</li>
    <li> Good design, except for stowing the cord for travel; not much progress there in the last three of these I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Too noisy when operated!</li>
    <li> It is very loud and I wish it had a cover, but it works perfect, no problem for me so far. I would not buy a more expensive model, this is all I need.</li>
    <li> I like the large reservoir.  It&#x27;s too powerful and I only use it on the lowest setting.  Very loud.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT  had one years ago and this one is great!</li>
    <li> Difficult to turn on an off.</li>
    <li> This is the type of water pic I have used for years, and loved my other one. My old one was getting stained and rough from water sitting in it (lazy me!) so I have tried two other types recently trying to replace it, and was dissatisfied by both as their volumes and pressure were inadequate.  This one has the large volume and a high enough pressure that my teeth and gums feel clean.  My dentist has liked my &amp;#34;mouth&amp;#34; in the last 7 years or so I have been using the water pic regularly, and she recommends this brand to all of her patients.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the one I purchased was defective and I returned it.</li>
    <li> I love my waterpik!  I&#x27;ve been using waterpiks for 25 or 30 years and would never be without it.</li>
    <li> Works a bit clunky/ noisy, but does the job. I would guess the more expensive ones work nicer.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use straight cold tap water if you have a deep- cold- well. Ouch!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and delivery was right on time</li>
    <li> Hygienist said I need to use one so I checked out what was available and so far this works the way I know it should.</li>
    <li> The one I bought is really loud. I can&#x27;t use it due to the sound it makes. why is it making a noise??</li>
    <li> Extremely noisy. By now, one would think they would have made this more quiet.</li>
    <li> love it...does what my old did...at first my gums were sensitive and but not anymore...which indicates to me that the spot that I was concerned about are less of a concern now after using my the waterpik classic pro</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This product is everything that I expected.  It leaves your mouth feeling incredibly fresh and clean.  I truly love it.</li>
    <li> I really REALLY wish I did not waste my time and money on this. Now it&#x27;s just sitting in a corner in the hallway closet. It is loud, too many parts, sprays everywhere, overall...wth was I thinking...</li>
    <li> great improvement over the earlier model, this one doesn&#x27;t make as much noise or vibrate as much as its predecessor did.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Don&#x27;t buy the battery model</li>
    <li> I detest using regular floss and my dentist has agreed this is a very good alternative.</li>
    <li> My teeth and gums haven&#x27;t been healthier.</li>
    <li> This is a travel machine for me.  It&#x27;s compact, and fits nicely in a suitcase.  Being without a water pic for even a week is no longer an option for me.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to get use to.  Noisy but okay.  I floss and then use this product - have not used it long enough to see if it helps with gum issues but does a good job removing &#x27;debris&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Very Good Product... Did just as advertised. Also fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I have had four Water Piks in the past and this one is a real disappointment. It is difficult attaching the water cup to the base, the coiled hose is unmanageable and because of the unearthly racket it makes when running you have to wait for everyone in the house to wake up before using it. I gave it two stars only because it does work, but all the previous versions were preferable. I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> Enjoying the Waterpick. I had one before so knew I would like it.</li>
    <li> Have used Water Piks for years and would not like to be without one. I have gotten good service out of each one. This one is as good a s the rest were.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. However, the button on the handle to stop the flow of water doesn&#x27;t work very well. Every time I use it, it makes a huge mess so I only use it when I feel like I really need it. Otherwise, I just use regular floss.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, great and I am so glad I have it now. I had another one for many, many years and this one is a replacement.</li>
    <li> I love the waterpik with the exception of the cover and where the on/off switch is located. The cover needs to fit over the entire unit including the water reservoir, but doesn&#x27;t. The on/off switch needs to be located on the wand rather than the unit, creates awkward operation.</li>
    <li> I have been using water piks for over 30 years and have found this model to last the longest. I usually get 5 years out of these, but only 1 to 2 years out of the pro model.  The travel models don&#x27;t seem to last over a year for me.  I also highly recommend these as an adjunct to flossing for orthodontic patients.</li>
    <li> Works really well, but it vibrates its way off of whatever it sits on and spills water all over the place. On the plus side, my bathroom floor is extra clean. I had one over 30 years ago that did the same thing. Why have&#x27;nt they solved this defect by now? Frustrating!</li>
    <li> very nice item. I love it.</li>
    <li> This waterpik worked well for 6 months then stopped pumping water. I called for warranty support and had to demo the unit at the sink while running back and forth to the phone. I&#x27;m disappointed that it failed so quickly for the money it cost. Also worried the replacement will suffer similarly. My dad had one that worked for years - now everything is made in China :(</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.  Only reason I did not give a 5 star rating is that the reservoir does not empty completely so it must be removed to empty.  I am concerned about wear on the connection that may occur after repeated use.</li>
    <li> Much better than my old one.</li>
    <li> Excelent device. I&#x27;m ussing every day at night. Thanks for asking.</li>
    <li> CHEAPLY MADE WITH PLASTIC CORD THAT CRACKS TOO SOON AND THE ENTIRE APPLIANCE BECOMES A THROWAWAY, BUT I NEED IT.</li>
    <li> In my quest to keep all my teeth as well as have healthy gums, I decided I needed a waterpik water flosser.  It is easy to setup and use.  It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and is not noisy.  It is just what I needed to add to my electric toothbrush</li>
    <li> How anyone gets along without a Waterpik is beyond me! What do you do, use floss?!!!</li>
    <li> Works great seem to work smoother and beter than the 20 yr old one I relaced</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. That said, I have to add that it is far noisier than our older model and has been known to vibrate right off the shelf on which we use to stored it. I much prefer the older one we had but my son, who wears braces, says this one is better.</li>
    <li> Works great so far. Bought as a replacement for a lesser model of the same brand. This is more quiet and seems to operate with less vibration. All in all teeth and gums feel really clean.</li>
    <li> Some of the other reviews say this is loud. It is but it has a powerful little motor. It works really well at cleaning my sons braces. There are many different strengths you can choose from and we started on the lowest and have worked our way up. The most powerful one will actually pull drywall off of my wall where there is a crack (I&#x27;ve been playing with it).  I use the strongest setting on my own teeth and it is powerful but does not hurt. My dentist is very pleased and says my teeth are cleaner than they ever have been and so are my sons. I put a little bit of peroxide (1-2 teaspoons) in the water to keep the basin sanitary and it doesn&#x27;t effect the performance and is a great grout cleaner too. It&#x27;s best to close your mouth around the head and move around the teeth and then spit out. My only complaint is the hold button (to hold water pressure when spitting) is very hard to hold down. But I don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s a big enough problem to mark down a star. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase especially since this was a cheaper model!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Waterpik products for years. They work very well.</li>
    <li> Works OK but needs a muffler.</li>
    <li> Good price &amp; compact, but too loud during operation.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do.  A little messy water-wise, but that&#x27;s to be expected. It is effective in flushing debris from between teeth and under dental work. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This waterpik works pretty well. However, it is very loud and somewhat cumbersome to use. Really, if you want a nicer waterpik, you have to spend more. If you are after low price, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> works well. I replaced my older onewith this. After a number of years the hose breaks and the pump seals go bad.</li>
    <li> FOLLOW UP - October 4th, 2014 : I have been using it every day since it arrived and have gotten used to the sound of the motor winding down when it is under a load.  I have discovered that it is unstoppable.  Even though the motor winds down a little under a load it just keeps going and does a fine job.  Not exactly like my previous four WaterPik WP60-W&#x27;s but certainly every bit as good.  I am so glad that it is still available as I wouldn&#x27;t pay a penny for the new WaterPik \\&quot;Aquarius\\&quot; model, which I bought and then quickly returned.  I am increasing my rating to four stars and would happily buy another one if this one got lost.  It is good, does a good job, holds plenty of solution, nothing I can see to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 24th, 2014 : It is NOT quite as good as it once was.  It looks just like the original WP60 but the motor is underpowered.  As soon as it primes the pump it grinds down and produces a stream that is not as strong as the original.  It beats the hell out of the Aquarius and the Ultra but it is not as good as the original WP60.  Who knows how long it will last?  If you can&#x27;t lay your hands on an original \\&quot;new old stock\\&quot; WP60 then this one will just have to do, I guess.  I am disappointed.  Why did they change?  Probably the bean-counters.  I&#x27;d have happily paid $60.00 instead of $39.95 to have the superior quality and strong motor of the original WP60 (before being Made in China).</li>
    <li> works very well, with a background in dental I highly recommend this. love the two different size resovours, would be nice to have a cover top but does not take away from the unit</li>
    <li> I really like this Waterpik.  it is helping me keep my gums healthy and also improves my sinus symptoms.</li>
    <li> Great pic with very strong pressure, cleans in between your teeth well.</li>
    <li> Works great highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> great machine! easy to use!</li>
    <li> works well and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Dentist ordered my husband to buy one rather than try to floss around his new bridge. Seems to work well and his breath is much nicer now. He is more dedicated to using this than he was to flossing. Review also for tips (for me as I wanted WaterPik years ago).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with cleaning my teeth, and also an avid floss avoider. For years I&#x27;ve used the metal scrapers (and I still do)- but the waterpik makes teeth cleaning fun- and I use the left over water to give my sink a quick rinse. I still manage to find spots with the scraper, but the Waterpik get alot more out than just brushing alone.</li>
    <li> It is very good for my gum health. I went on vacation without it, and when I returned, my gums bled when I used it again. I wish I could take it with me.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT HOUSEHOLD ITEM  REASONABLY PRICED--  WELL MADE NAME BRAND  -- DELIVERED ON TIME  WHICH ARE --SOME  OF THE MANY REASONS --YOU HAVE SATISFIED CUSTOMERS</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this did not work at all. The pressure adjustment was either too hard or none at all. The water spills out easily. I just left it in the hotel room where I stayed. The small size was handy but I would never buy again.</li>
    <li> The pik was/is everything I expected. I was not careful the first few times and solution went all over the bathroom mirror.  The hand piece when wet is difficult to control when wet but otherwise, worth the price.</li>
    <li> first time it hurts the teeth, even on the lowest setting. The result is great and it shows in the smell of your breath and I can swear my teeth looked a bit more white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative part is that the machine makes so much noise--almost like a drilling noise, and  every time it&#x27;s vibrating while it is on, the machine moves off the edge of my sink. The water splatters everywhere and makes a mess. The stop button does need to press firmly or else the water continues to spray out and again messy. In addition, I thought the sprayer&#x27;s wire was too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is easy and it does get the tiny food particular out between your teeth that a toothbrush can&#x27;t get into it.</li>
    <li> The WP-73 met all my expectations.  It has a powerful spray, and well-regulated flow.  I particularly like the \\&quot;pik-pocket\\&quot; tip included (clever name!  I mentioned this to my husband, and said that, now I see it, I would have been surprised had WaterPik not thought of that clever name).  Suffering from periodontal disease for many years (since in my twenties), I would be missing most of my teeth at the age of 58, if not for a dental irrigator.  I have had a WaterPik WP-60, which lasted for eleven years with daily use, and it finally gave out on me.  This was the closest replacement, and I am quite pleased with it.    The only negative aspect of it, which is why I rated it with four stars instead of five, is that it is really noisy.  I have worn a hearing protector when using both the WP-60 and the WP-73, because the noise is just on the edge of where I am afraid of hearing damage over time.  Maybe not, but I don&#x27;t want to take a chance.</li>
    <li> Great for flossing. Watch out on the higher setting because it can really cut off some of your gum. I do not suggest any setting above the lowest for beginners. I can really feel the cleanliness after water flossing.</li>
    <li> Great product, my dentist recommended I get on.  Now I just need to actually use it.</li>
    <li> this is pretty much a home ear irrigation system, if you know what you&#x27;re doing. We cleared a chunk of wax the size of a pea out of his ear. Yuck, but this thing got the job done without a doctor&#x27;s visit.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended it &amp; it was fabulous.</li>
    <li> I bought the classic years ago and it is disappointing that they have not made it quieter .</li>
    <li> Works good, just has some leaks when filled and if you let it sit on the counter.</li>
    <li> 1 yr. later: if you think that 1 yr. is good enough for a water pick to las - then it is a great product! i feel 5 years is more acceptable. so i give a 2 star rating as it is still good for the teeth but unacceptable built in obsolescence! my last water pick lasted 2 years - also unacceptable to me. maybe it is just the WATER PIK products are NO GOOD anymore???  great cleaning power! but the others that say it is loud are correct! the water container is nice and big - let&#x27;s me do my whole mouth with plenty of water! i have only had this a few months, so i will update you re. BUILT-IN OBSOLESCENCE! the other water-pik unit i had i loved till the stupid tube broke and i could not repair it. this is unacceptable!!! i had a unit years ago and had it for 5 years - and never broke! shame on you water-pik! but i will update you on this unit. it cleans great and my teeth/gums/dentist sees the difference!</li>
    <li> Markedly better than the WP-100 that I had previously.  No leaks whatever, so far. Rotating head allows for easy and accurate access to all nooks and crannies.  Even my dental hygienist noticed improvements in reduced plaque and gum condition.</li>
    <li> works well - and a lot faster than flossing. Looking forward to my next checkup.</li>
    <li> Very noisy. It doesn&#x27;t have a lid so my cat likes to drink from the water tank. The tank doesn&#x27;t come off very easily so I can&#x27;t drain it daily. I ended up giving this one away and buying the better version like I had before. The upgraded version is well worth the price. I would not recommend this unless you need a cheap version.</li>
    <li> Really good for teeth that are close together.  Use it every day.</li>
    <li> This product is very bad, only used a month, it can&#x27;t not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update information: I have repaired it by myself, although it looks no beautiful as first, but can use again.</li>
    <li> Great product does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Love it but it is very loud! Does an awesome job and the love the amount of water it holds</li>
    <li> Really keeps the dentist happy.</li>
    <li> Nothing like my old water pic that i had for 20 years or so.Not happy with it &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.Not as user friendly.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as my old one.</li>
    <li> I have wanted a Waterpik for a while and finally just went ahead and got one. What was I waiting for. LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Waterpik for my grandson who just got braces and he loves it as does his Orthodondist.</li>
    <li> Spoke with my dentist about this product.  His advice:  be sure you always use the picks to spray water at a 90 degree angle to the gums.  This prevents forcing any debris under the gum line and causing further problems.  Great product!  And most important, it works!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great.......no problems whatsoever......works exactly as promised</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and, even better ! This new unit replaced a much older one but, it seems to me that this new one is much more powerful than my original one had been at the outset. And, as usual, the Amazon purchase and delivery was smooth as silk</li>
    <li> I love this type of waterpik and this one works beautifully. It is especially nice with the additional medicine cup as my old one didn&#x27;t have one.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I start using some sort of water jet to clean between teeth and below the gum line.  This WaterPix really does the job, and I do NOT have it turned to full power.  I fill the tank with the glass by the sink and keep the tank full so it is ready to use when I want. PROS:  effective, simple to use. CONS: somewhat noisy, takes some getting used to having the nozzle in place before turning it on, coiled hose can be stiff  UPDATE:  It still works great.  I can&#x27;t believe how much stuff it flushes out of my mouth after I thoroughly brush my teeth.  My dentist says to keep it up.</li>
    <li> This Water pik is very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;However, the settings are a bit forceful&lt;br /&gt;Even the lowest setting is &#x27;hard&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does get the job done</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase of this item.  It&#x27;s working as expected but takes some getting used to.  I&#x27;m hoping it will make a difference at my next check up.  Too soon to tell so I&#x27;m only giving it a 4 star right now.</li>
    <li> I am now a believer. This has increase my dental health.  This is especially good if, like me, you have deep pockets from previous dental disease.</li>
    <li> Not much wrong with this product...definitely good for your gums...I use it every day..</li>
    <li> Nice flosser. Takes some patience to get accustomed to using.</li>
    <li> has improved gum condition in one month</li>
    <li> I have used this thing once and it squirted water on the walls and everywhere.  Even though I had the button pressed, it still seemed like it just kept spraying water.  I really didn&#x27;t care for it and may not use it again until I get time to clean the water off the wall in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband whose last Waterpik started to die after 20 years of use. This one is a little more modern but works as well as his old one and he is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Works much better than the old one it replaced. It&#x27;s quieter, too. My mouth feels nice and clean after I use it.</li>
    <li> I’ve had a few of these now. I like this one because of the huge water reservoir. Works like every other waterpik.</li>
    <li> Essential to good dental hygiene.  I first discovered this product when my son had braces.  He would floss for at least an hour with regular dental floss.  When I found this water flosser, it was an answer to prayer.  He never had to floss with dental floss again and his othrodonist always said his teeth looked great and even better...we never told him my son no longer used the waxed floss anymore.  When his braces came off, his teeth had no decay whatsoever or any plaque buildup.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to give a good review.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to make use of this product. I find the devise to be difficult to control resulting in spraying my mirror and having water running down my shirt. I do not want to swallow the water that has flushed the bacteria out of my gums. I will try to learn a good way to use the devise.</li>
    <li> Quieter than our &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; waterpik and works perfectly.  Easy to set up and use. I like the crystal water canister.</li>
    <li> Works fine for me, a bit loud, , but I&#x27;m just getting used to using it. Good for two a couple or a single. A family would need more tips</li>
    <li> Received my Waterpic today. Takes a little getting use to but it&#x27;s everything it says it is.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT......MY FIRST WATER PIC LASTED 13 YEARS, I HOPE TO GET THE SAME OUT OF THIS ONE. I WAS TOLD BY A WATER PIC REP THAT I SHOULD CHANGE OUT THE &amp;#34;CLEANING HEAD&amp;#34; - THAT ATTACHES TO THE LONG TUBE, EVERY 3 TO 4 MONTHS. I NEVER KNEW THAT BUT NOT DOING THATA CAN SEND THE WATER PIC INTO NOT WORKING RIGHT &amp; THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED IN MY CASE. SO, IF WE TAKE CARE OF THEM &amp; DO THE THINGS NECESSARY, THEY WILL RUN FOREVER. I WOULD BE LOST WITHOUT ONE.</li>
    <li> Holder/stand for the water pik is hard to get to, top water basin goes over where water pik is stored so awkward to get in and out. Kind of silly because design does not add much to water storage capacity</li>
    <li> I really like this water pik. It works very well.... would highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I have an older version, which I like. This one is a cheap replacement, vibrates a lot and moves all over the counter top. The placement of the pik is poor, doesn&#x27;t fit right. I will stick with my old model.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is one of the worst products that has ever been designed. IT IS LOUD..... and I mean loud.... I am returning this as it wakes up my wife and even the kids in the next room..... it obviously uses a cheap pump that makes the ENTIRE unit vibrate (yes the whole unit moves) and my wife compared it to being as loud as a blender.... Considering most of us will use this before bedtime, I don&#x27;t think using something this loud is viable.....</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with how clean my teeth feel after using this product.  The true test will be when I have my next check up.</li>
    <li> Since I started using the Water Pic a few years ago, I have been able to greatly reduce plaque build-up and gum recession.  I would highly recommend the use of a Water Pic for anyone who has a serious dental plaque issue.</li>
    <li> I decided on this model because reviews said it had the strongest pressure, lasts longer than newer ones and is less expensive.  I am very happy with this unit, I like the looks and color and it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the counter.  The big reservoir is nice to have and turned over it functions as a lid.  I am not sure I will use the smaller reservoir much, but it is good to have if needed.  This Classic has higher pressure than my last 2 flossers (Interplak and cordless Waterpik). The cord is kind of short and I pull the unit forward on the counter during use so as not to put needless stress on the cord and fittings, a little inconvenient.  You can replace the cord and handle, but hope that will not be necessary.  I do not think it is that noisy.</li>
    <li> Voltage and plug useless in Europe. When the article is shown in your page, it should be clear next to the picture of WaterPik.&lt;br /&gt;To return items is worse. First Amazone does not accept and second, in the uncertain case that they do, After paying taxes, customs and postage, with luck you may recover half of the money we pay.&lt;br /&gt;Result: I will never ever will buy again by this mean...</li>
    <li> Very Quick response. Delivery was within a day after placing the order.&lt;br /&gt;Product is more Compact than the previous Waterpick Flosser I used for many years. A considerable advantage.&lt;br /&gt;Motor is more powerful than previously. I only need to use a low power-setting to achieve the required flossing pressure.&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if the Container could be engineered to cover the base. The unit would then be &amp;#34;Packable&amp;#34; for travel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this one a few years ago until it died and it is still the same great water flosser. The pump is a little noisy but it still does a great job at irrigating the teeth. This one comes with a small basin with a port to the pump for your favorite mouth rinse. It is very easy to clean also.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Waterpik for years and I&#x27;m very satisfied.This model works well. Although it is loud, I can live with that.The drawback is that there is no cover on this unit and the models that I have purchased in the past all have covers. When I called to inquire about this I was told that I should empty the tub after each use and dismantle it until I use it the next time. Problem is that I use it 3 or 4 times a day and this is very time consuming. The agents I talked to were very indifferent and unprofessional. I solved the problem by going to the dollar store and buying a food type of cover and using it in between usage to keep out dust and any flying thingies that might be thirsty. I hope Waterpic comes to their senses and adds a cover for this unit the same as they have for their other models.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd update on this review. I have had the Waterpik for about 11 months now.  Recently the water was leaking from the reservoir when I pulled it off the base unit.  I read somewhere that the leak maybe due to the valve on the bottom of the reservoir.  I called Waterpik and they confirmed the problem and mailed me 4 replacement valves.  Good service by them.  Otherwise the Waterpik is still working great!!   This is the 2nd update on my review.  I have had the Waterpik now for 6 months and is still working just like it did the first day.  This is an update on my review following.  It now has been just over 3 months and my Waterpik is working as the good as the day I first got it, still using it twice a day.  I have used a Waterpik in the past and when I was recently shopping for a new oral irrigation device I came across this one, read the reviews and purchased it.  I have had it for about 2 weeks and I am very happy with it.  I use my Waterpik (or other brand oral irrigation device) twice a day using mouthwash instead of water, per a recommendation from an oral hygienist years ago, so it does get a good work out.  So far, so good.  I like the fact that this model comes with a smaller, special reservoir which is great for mouthwash.  I also like the fact that with Waterpik you get a handle with the capability of rotating the tip with your finger by rotating the knob on the handle versus using your hand to rotate the entire handle.  It came with 3 tips including a pik pocket which is great for your gums.  Overall I am happy.  Now we will just have to see how long this unit lasts.  It does come with a 2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> Years ago, I used a Waterpik. This is basically the same unfancy thing under a different name (&#x27;water flosser&#x27;). Still works, still a good thing. Still tend to use just one head/attachment though. Good price compared to box stores.</li>
    <li> The stream is strong, which is good, and I can fill it up with lots of water, which is good. The two complaints I have are that there is no top, so I put something on top of it to avoid dust and debris getting inside, and secondly, unlike my first water pik (I forget the brand), this has a tendency to spritz on my clothes, so I find it necessary to wear a towel as a &amp;#34;bib&amp;#34;. Anything that is inconvenient makes it that much more likely that I will skip cleaning my teeth, which is not good. I have found water piks to be a wonderful alternative to flossing, and I have a hard time with flossing. So I don&#x27;t know what the deal is with the water spritzing, and I don&#x27;t know why there is no top, but the quality of the water stream and the size of the reservoir is very good. I hope three stars was generous enough.</li>
    <li> Blasts the junk out of your teeth &amp; gums.  My parents had one when I was a kid and I used it every once in a while.  Now that I am older - and trying to take care of what I have in my mouth.... we made the decision to get this.  Easily the best 40 bucks we&#x27;ve spent here.  This is something I look forward to every day now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Waterpik Flossers for years, and the last one was cordless/rechargeable. It did not hold up well, so I bought the &amp;#34;old standby&amp;#34;... it works great and is far superior to the latest and greatest. Sometimes you can&#x27;t beat a Classic!</li>
    <li> Works great, just as advertised!</li>
    <li> Wish I had ordered the other model.  It works well, but who likes to dry the reservoir out, take the tip out of the handle (it won&#x27;t fit otherwise) and then flip the reservoir over as the lid.  Can&#x27;t leave it open or hair or dust and stuff will get into it.  Also, the unit is very light and the cord exit slot does not have anything to keep the cord going out the slot, so it ends up under the unit making it tippy.  It would be so simple for the maker to add a clip to keep the cord in place and at the same time, they could replace the useless tiny reservoir with a lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it is really nice having the power control on the handle.</li>
    <li> there are lots of model out there to choose from ... this seemed like a good choice considering features and price ... ... i am very satisfed</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use this device daily and love it.  The device is a bit more noisy than our old Waterpik that wore out after ten years.  This one does the job however.</li>
    <li> Good price.Makes a lot of noise but worth it.</li>
    <li> Serves purpose but should have a lid on top.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel very clean after each use. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because of the amount of water that gets sprayed around the bathroom with each use. Make sure it&#x27;s in your mouth before you turn it on and keep your mouth pointed over the sink. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a Waterpik.  Very pleased with it.  No longer have a problem with food getting stuck between tooth and gum.  Gotta believe the gums are healthier.  It&#x27;s like a massage for the inside of  your mouth.  If you&#x27;ve never used one, watch the videos.  The unit itself seems to be of good quality.    Update:  My dental hygienist asked if I flossed often.  I told her \\&quot;No but I use a Waterpik\\&quot;.  She said \\&quot;Well, it&#x27;s working\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I bought this model to replace an original 20+ year old model that finally bit the dust.  This new model works well and the water pulsing is actually more powerful than the original.  Of course the water pulse strength is adjustable, and the lowest setting is perfect for me, but I&#x27;d recommend starting out on the lowest setting.  Of course your mileage might vary.  This model comes with 2 standard jet tips so if your family usage is more than 2 people you may want to order extra.  This new model is actually a little quieter than the original model but if you&#x27;ve never used one before it might seem loud.  The choice of using a smaller water reservoir is also nice.  Those that have complained that &amp;#34;water gets everywhere&amp;#34; just haven&#x27;t learned how to use the water pik correctly.  It&#x27;s a high pressure water spray and if you take it out of your mouth while the water is flowing water will &amp;#34;get everywhere&amp;#34;!  And to help that, this new model has a button in the handle to temporarily stop the water flow if desired.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and it does a great job of cleaning every hard to reach place including between my crowns and under my 2 bridges.  Time will tell on its durability, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel like I just got out of the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> thank you for fast shipping. I got the color ( gray and white) I actually wanted.  I have been using this for a many years and I think it is always giving me a good oral hygene.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great appliance for the money!</li>
    <li> This works better for the health of my teeth and gums than anything else I have ever tried.  I have been using a waterpik since I first developed gum problems while pregnant many years ago.  I use it with a bit of mouthwash.  I get compliments from the hygienist when I use it regularly together with brushing with Sonicare, and no compliments any other way. I would give it 5 stars, except the rubber fitting where reservoir connects is a little temperamental.  Still, well worth the sale price that I found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I can tell a big difference.  Teeth feel nice and smooth.  It is a little noisy but who cares.  Make sure you hold that pause button down firmly before you remove the tip from your mouth.  Great product.  Hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I tried a cordless but the water jet isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as this classic model. A must have for dental maintenance.</li>
    <li> Not happy at all with the quality, very cheaply made, it is too loud and the power would knock your teeth out!</li>
    <li> I love this one... good variety of squirt pressures, and finally a waterpik where the bowl STAYS on the base while you are moving it or pouring from it or flossing with it.... no more floods all over the sink</li>
    <li> It requires dexterity to put the water container back onto the unit after filling or washing.  I have resorted to filling another container and leaving the unit&#x27;s water container always on.  You must position it exactly to get it back.  The exact position cannot be seen.  It is awkward with the container full of water to find the sweet spot so that you can put it back on the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the reason I don&#x27;t return it is that it does a far better job than any water pick I have ever owned.  I would buy again if this unit breaks down, but would hope that they make it so that it is not a struggle to get the water container back on.</li>
    <li> not as good nor as easy to use as my older one BUT just glad there was one to be found--the old teledyne water pik was the best and easiest to use.  I seem to go through at least one per year so hope i will be able to find them in the future--guess when the name flosser was put on them the velocity was a bit reduced .</li>
    <li> It would have more stars if it were not so loud.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been less than a year, and the water pump doesn&#x27;t seem to want to pull from the reservoir anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandson who has braces.  It took him a few days to get the hang of it but now he&#x27;s like a pro.  It has really helped keep his teeth clean and get all those nasty bits of food that are stuck between his braces.  The price is very manageable and it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I use it every day.  Dentist tells me with the regimen I have now, I should be able to go all the way with my own teeth--and I only have 4 fillings and am 57.  My father bought our first Waterpik in the early/mid 60&#x27;s and forced us to use it (I hated it).  Now, I can&#x27;t wait, it gets all that junk out from between your teeth and even after brushing, and after all these years, I&#x27;m shocked at what&#x27;s still in there.  Recommend to anyone trying to have good dental health.  This particular purchase was for my nephew for his birthday.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for flossing the teeth, but I also use it in another way.  I have severe sinus problems, and I use the Water Pik for sinus irrigation, using an attachment purchased from another company.  I use this twice a day, every day.  It always lasts through the two-year warranty period, but eventually stops working, and I buy a replacement.  As an Amazon Prime member, when it stopped working this time, I was able to get a replacement the same day.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my 10+ year old Waterpic. I read a lot of reviews saying it was pretty noisy. The one it replaced was noisier than this one with only half the power. Nothing fancy about it. Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Great replacement model..updated.</li>
    <li> Bad buy. Didn&#x27;t even last one year.</li>
    <li> Works great! Only drawback is it&#x27;s super loud and vibrates - don&#x27;t try using this at midnight if you have neighbors.</li>
    <li> received as promised. thanks.</li>
    <li> its workign its working. my teeth feel very clean afterwards but I would suggest using warm water. makes a lot of noise though</li>
    <li> WTF? This thing is the noisiest, most ridiculous contraption I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Maybe I&#x27;m not well-versed in water picks, but to have a really loud device that squirts water all over the bathroom as you try to control is isn&#x27;t really my thing. Instead I got the shower water pick, which, at the very least, squirts water all over a place where water is meant to be squirted.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this machine.  It has a very loud motor and I live in an apartment complex with apartments and tenants all around me--above, to the side, and below.  Maybe I should exchange it, but this was the model I wanted.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> My wife got braces so we bought this for her. She loves it, now she doesn&#x27;t have to spend 30 minutes trying to get food out of her teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a simple, no frills water pik and works just great.  It is much lighter than the previous model I had but does not seem cheap or poorly made. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> good but &amp;#34;stop button&amp;#34; stuck in ON position - after 4 months or so of use&lt;br /&gt;I pried it up with knife&lt;br /&gt;as expected for plastic&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t use the stop button-&lt;br /&gt;just turn it on and off&lt;br /&gt;or you will have to buy a new hand piece</li>
    <li> This is my first water pik, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I really like it. The unit is small. So doesnt take up much room. I think my teeth get cleaner than when I flossed. I would buy the same one again if this broke.</li>
    <li> Like the Waterpik i used growing up.</li>
    <li> We swear by the Waterpik flossers. They&#x27;re not as powerful as they used to be, but they still do a great job. Have one great dental check up after another. Before using, always had big dental bills. LOVE this thing.</li>
    <li> I use this daily. I like the easily removable dispenser cup. You have to pay attention to what your doing when you replace the smaller cup or it will fall off. I find it easiest to look down from the top and align the black inlet with the drain on the cup, then press down, you just have to practice a few times. No deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very powerful and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it! She has braces and it helps her since she can&#x27;t floss</li>
    <li> Drippy and kinda messy.</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik that I have owned.  They always work as expected and it leaves your teeth and gums feeling better.</li>
    <li> This is noisy but it has helped me with a gum/tooth pocket. Your teeth feel very clean after using it and very easy to use. My dentist says my gums look great.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace a three year old unit for my husband. Seems to be working the way it should.</li>
    <li> Recently I needed periodontal surgery, and my hygienist recommended that I get a Waterpik.  I have been using it twice daily, and I am extremely satisfied with it.  It removes a surprising amount of particles that my electric toothbrush alone cannot.</li>
    <li> Love using this waterpik but it is LOUD.  Really really LOUD.  I live in a duplex in military housing and I have to remember to use this thing before about 9 otherwise, I feel really badly for my neighbors who probably hear it from their side of the house.  Our bathrooms are connected.  It works well, does a great job in a short amount of time.  Start on the lowest level and work up to your comfort level.  It can be deceiving and you think you can handle more but that water stream is brutal!  Also, make sure you hold the pause button before you turn it on because it will start streaming right away.  I learned that the hard way.  You&#x27;d think I would have thought of that.  But no, I did not.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awful. Used a few times, then tossed in the garbage,  after purchasing a Waterpik® Ultra Water Flosser (WP-100), which is a grade above this basic model. I previously owned the Ultra Water Flosser and loved it. I bought this one, in an attempt to save $$. The Ultra Flosser costs more, but the adage, \\&quot; you get what you pay for\\&quot;, has never been more true in this case.    In other reviews, I see complaints about the button on the wand and the noise. Those complaints are accurate to my experience with this machine. Also, it really is very, VERY loud. When I used it, my husband asked (as he turned up the TV volume) what kind of equipment I was running. You see, he thought maybe the washer was running and had an out of balance load. For all the trouble with the button, and the noise, you get......VERY inconsistent jet spray. I don&#x27;t know if this was due to the cheap and difficult to use control buttons, or if this thing had to struggle to prime the pump. Whatever the reason, the result was poor jet spray, IF I got any at all.      I would never, NEVER suggest this miserable machine to anyone. If you want a waterpik, opt for a better grade, and you will have a much better experience, in my opinion. I love the Waterpick ultra flosser.  It was my first experience with a Waterpik,  and it lasted a good 4 years or so with daily use. It operates with less noise than this one, has a very consistent jet spray and better capability to adjust the strength of the spray as well. The Ultra is worth the extra money. As far as this one... I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I&#x27;m taking the time to do this one to save others the waste of money and time that I suffered in making a poor choice.</li>
    <li> Very loud motor. Good design with good controls. Many attachments which will serve the purpose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Waterpiks for a number of years now and love them.  Even after flossing the waterpik still finds food particles.</li>
    <li> Bought for husband with gum disease.  He says the water pick works great!  His gums are tightening.  The &amp;#34;pocket pick&amp;#34; attachment could be bait stiffer but all in all would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too loud is my main complaint.  Louder than other models.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mom as she needed one according to her dentist. The first one she received leaked and a couple of the attachments didn&#x27;t fit properly. She was never able to get the high pressure out of it for it to do the job it was supposed to. Amazon was great and they allowed us to return just slightly out of the return period for a replacement. The replacement works as it should and she is much happier.</li>
    <li> Does the job that I needed it to do</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;*Nicely gets food out from between your teeth&lt;br /&gt;*My teeth are close together, so this lets me clean without having to worry about floss fitting/shredding between my teeth&lt;br /&gt;*Tip easily twists so you can adjust during cleaning to get the right angles&lt;br /&gt;*My dental hygienist said my gums and teeth looked even better than before after using this for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;*Variable pressure levels (though this could be better)&lt;br /&gt;*Big reservoir holds more than enough water (I usually only need to fill it to the 2nd or 3rd line)&lt;br /&gt;*Comes with a specialty reservoir so you can add mouthwash for a better clean (my dental hygienist recommends this)&lt;br /&gt;*Comes with extra tips (easy to replace tips, and they stay in place until you want to remove them)&lt;br /&gt;*Available in frustration free packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;*Very loud&lt;br /&gt;*No lid for the water reservoir, so if you want to keep it sanitary you have to dump the water and flip it upside down (like a cover) after every use. To fully cover everything, like they show in the one image, you would also have to remove the tip from your wand. I leave the tip on my wand and simply balance the reservoir over it.&lt;br /&gt;*I wish there was a little more control over the speed. There are several settings, but it goes from no pressure to painful pressure within the first 3 settings.&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s awkward to use at first. The first few times I used this, I ended up squirting water all over myself and my bathroom. You also have water running out of your mouth and trying to angle it so the water goes between your teeth on the inside is a bit tricky. It&#x27;s not a big deal once you get the hang of it, but the first few times you use this, you may want to wear a raincoat and cover anything in your bathroom you don&#x27;t want to get wet.&lt;br /&gt;*I wish the button on the handle turned the water on instead of off. It is awkward to press and hold when you want the water off. It&#x27;s especially awkward trying to hold that and reach for the power switch to turn the machine off. (I suggest putting the machine on the side of your sink opposite your dominant hand.)&lt;br /&gt;*Made in China&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Overall, this is a good machine, but I really wish I had just spent more money on one of the more expensive models. Most of these cons would not be issues with the more expensive models, so my recommendation is to bite the bullet and get a good one right from the start.the power switch to turn the machine off.

    <li> Would be 5/5 stars if I didn&#x27;t know about a flaw in all the previous Waterpiks I have owned - the hose/tubing between pump and wand becomes brittle and breaks after a couple of years.  Of course, I have not used this unit until hose/tubing failure.  I just bought it.  I&#x27;ve got a couple of years to go ... then, I expect I will need to throw it out - just like every previous Waterpik.  But, I will not know if they have improved the hose/tubing until it fails.    I replaced my old WP-60 with this one (WP-72).  This is my 4th unit, at least.  All discarded for the same reason: hose/tubing failure.  I have also owned the WP-70 and WP-100. This one has some improvements over my previous units worth noting.  But the hose/tubing appears to be the same.    Pros:  1. The pressure is noticeably higher than previous units.  In all before, I put the pressure to maximum for flossing, even for the first use.  Can&#x27;t do that with this one.  There is enough pressure to actually cause pain and cut gums, even after acclimation.  So this one I set at about 75% max output.  2. It is more quiet than all previous models I&#x27;ve owned.  The &#x27;clattering&#x27; of the pump is much diminished.  This is a great improvement.  3. Not an improvement but worth saying:  Does a great job, just as all before have done. (Note: In the interim, I also purchased the Waterpik rechargeable unit locally - which does NOT do a good job.)    Cons:  1. This unit does not come with the number of nozzles I am accustomed to being included.  Unfortunately, I discarded the old tongue attachment and additional standard and pocket nozzles with the old unit.  If you need more than 2 standard and 1 pocket nozzle, save the old ones from your previous unit.  Not tested by me; but, they should surely fit, as demonstrated by the standardized replacement wand assembly for all machines of this type.  2. I expect the hose to fail.  I have discarded all previous units due to failure of the hose/tubing adjacent to the wand.  There was nothing else wrong with any of those units.    Trying to repair the hose/tubing break has been futile.  I initially thought that flexing of the hose/tubing at the wand connection caused it to weaken over time.  Wrong.  The entire hose/tubing becomes brittle; so, opening the wand, cutting off a piece of the hose/tubing, and reassembly gains me about 3 days of *careful* use before it breaks again.  Splicing the hose/tubing yields the same outcome - rapid failure.    You can purchase the wand assembly with new hose/tubing for about 1/4 to 1/2 the price of a new Waterpik unit (approximate price includes shipping).  But, much more $$ for my location.  Then you must disassemble the base unit down to the pump to install the wand assembly.  You can not buy just the hose/tubing.  Why?    If this machine did not preform so well; or, if they had any real competition, I would give the Waterpik 1 star due to what the company must already know (and I expect, counts on) - the hose/tubing will fail, creating the likely sale of another *entire unit* within a couple of years.  I wonder what the extra cost would be if they used a higher quality, heavier hose/tubing between pump and wand that would last as long as the pump.  Maybe $1 or $2 per unit retail?    This kind of manufacturing with a fatal flaw in a low cost component irritates the heck out of me.  The science of plastics becoming brittle, stress fractures, and how to extend the life of hydraulic hoses is well advanced.  Why the hose/tubing installed isn&#x27;t of better quality, or why consumers can&#x27;t buy just the hose/tubing for repair is no mystery.  But, the likely answer is disturbing.    Even so, when there is no decent alternative - you buy what works.  The Waterpik does that and does it well - for awhile.    Update 2/18/15:  Not sure what to say about the common complaint from others about noise and vibration. Those comments apply perfectly to my previous machines; but, not to this new one.  Maybe simply luck of the draw.  Will update if this changes with use over time.</li>
    <li> I like the basic function of this product. It&#x27;s great for cleaning between the teeth, much better than flossing and brushing. The issue that warrants a 3star rating is that it has no water reservoir cover/lid. I use this daily and add warm water to what may have been left the day before. Without a cover dust, powder and such could collect in the water. I currently have a makeshift cover and am resisting ordering one even if they make them. The price I paid should have included a cover, it didn&#x27;t occur to me that it wouldn&#x27;t have one. I&#x27;ll happily exchange the useless small reservoir for a cover.</li>
    <li> Had it before and this is an improved version.</li>
    <li> A great product to keep your great smile!</li>
    <li> I made quite a mess while I was learning to use this, but eventually got it down enough to not get all the water on the floor instead of in the sink!</li>
