      <li>It also has a nice shine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Optimum No Lye Relaxer for more than 10 years.</li>
      <li>Just follow the directions and never ever chemically process your own hair, you can&#x27;t avoid over processing it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been relaxing my own hair for years.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve got to know your own hair.</li>
      <li>After my stylist examined the contents and read the instructions, she was impressed by the high quantity.</li>

      <li>I have alot of hair, but its very fine.</li>
      <li>I have great success with Frederic Fekkai products and love Phytodefrisant Botanical Hair</li>
      <li>From there I am able to go about 12 weeks before having to retouch.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Be sure to stay within the relaxing time limits  6.</li>
      <li>ok, so i read all the reviews and wished that i had been using this product 2 yrs ago when i decided that i would never buy a dollar store perm again.</li>
      <li>I will use it again to see if it will take more than a couple of applications to get the results I want.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product to many people, those of whom tend to disregard my recommendation once I tell them the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also in love with the Moisturizing Styling Balm cream with Quinoa Oil.  </li>
      <li>If I change to Index 1 and for sure after using the product for a 6 month period.  </li>
      <li>Make sure, with a comb (the instructions say don&#x27;t use one, but I do and nothing has happened), to straighten every hair.</li>
      <li>and I could not have ben more pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>If I change to Index 1 and for sure after using the product for a 6 month period.  </li>
      <li>The only difference between Phytorelaxer and Africa&#x27;s Best Organics Relaxer is the fact that it has calcium hydroxide in it.  </li>
      <li>I put in the product today 8/24/07, and I love it, love it, love it.  </li>
      <li>I found that Africa&#x27;s Best Organics No-Lye Organic Conditioning Relaxer System, Regular, has Guanidine Carbonate Calcium Hydroxide, Egg Protein, Soybean Oil, Shea Butter, Silk Protein, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E, Olive Oil, Mink Oil, Carrot Oil, Cholesterol, Honey and Herbs.</li>
      <li>It did straighten, maybe more than I thought it would.  </li>
      <li>I do not recommend waiting 10 weeks for a touch-up for most people</li>
      <li>My hair felt lighter and had more movement to it once she finished.</li>
      <li>I searched the web for a safe product and found this relaxer.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the outcome but not blown away.  </li>
      <li>well it&#x27;s nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is so much better for your hair.     </li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;ve been relaxing my hair for more than 35 of these years (mostly using lye relaxers).   </li>
      <li>If you have any experience treating your own hair, I feel comfortable in saying go for it--</li>
      <li>My advise to all no matter what you use is to invest in vitamins for your hair because our diet affects our hair&#x27;s growth, get weekly treatments whether you chemically treat your hair or not because course hair needs more love and humectants, and do the research.</li>
      <li>:) &lt;br</li>
      <li>whatever is \\&quot;on sale\\&quot; with satisfying results.   </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this relaxer.  </li>
      <li>so I can maintain top results with moisture and bounce.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Mum :)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
      <li>If you want more information about this company go to houseofcheatham.com  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had more hair loss from going to the salon than just doing my hair myself.</li>
      <li>The price was a blow, but seven weeks later, it still looks great!  </li>
      <li>I have to agree with many of the reviews here.</li>
      <li>My hair is more tangled after I wash it.  </li>
      <li>Would you bake your favorite lemon cake without putting in the lemon extract?</li>
      <li>I love Phyto.</li>
      <li>You pay more to remedy mishaps.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t burn my scalp like most have.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I didn&#x27;t have to touch-up my relaxer for 7 weeks!!!</li>
      <li>After using this relaxing system, my hair is beautiful, soft to the touch and truly MANAGEABLE!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll skimp on shoes, clothes, household items, etc using coupons &amp; finding sales to insure I have enough to spare for great HEALTHY hair maintenance!</li>
      <li>When I first applied the relaxer, I loved it.  </li>
      <li>The results weren&#x27;t nearly as good as the first time.</li>
      <li>The relaxer has a nice mild fragrance to it, almost a floral scent.  </li>
      <li>(Bumble and Bumble Styling Spray is another amazing product for great flat ironing results.)</li>
      <li>The quantity was ample considering that most relaxers are cheap with the amount they give</li>
      <li>PLEaSE see the link to a GREAT site for 100% natural hair care products.</li>
      <li>I first thought it to be a great investment ($60) and worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you follow the directions to the letter, SMOOTH the hair until you see your desired texture, and DON&#x27;T put it on your scalp.</li>
      <li>Great shine, soft hair,</li>
      <li>My hair was Pin straight when finished, which I loved.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and works fast while doing a good job.</li>
      <li>You know the nape of the hair that breaks off easily and does not seem to grow.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve been on the quest for a relaxer that is easy on my hair but straightens it.     </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Don&#x27;t try to do this yourself.  Have someone help you.  I&#x27;ve used relaxers since Curl Free days and 19 years old.  I&#x27;m 64 now and this will be my last straight hair days.  I am white; medium length very tight curls; can be frizzy, probably because of some gray.  It did straighten, maybe more than I thought it would.  Trying to do it yourself and keep it off your neck and ears during the smoothing process, which is a mess, is almost impossible.  As a result, I have some irritation on those areas.  Plan on trimming your ends and I think it will take a few washings to get rid of the flat, next to my head, look.  It was a procedure!</li>
    <li> I have a 9 year old daughter with thick, coarse hair. She is on a swim team that has her practicing 5 times a week for 1 1/2 hours each day. In the begining her hair began turning a dirty blond. This caused my daughter distress. We were using other boxed relaxers ie.. Dr. Miracle. The box relaxers were too strong, burned her easily, and made her hair to straightened. Another swim mom told me about Phyto, and warned me about the cost.  The cost was steep, but well worth it. I can&#x27;t take my daughter to a salon due to the fact she spends a lot of time in the pool, so I care for her hair myself. I love Phyto. It straigtens her hair as though I pressed it with the comb. It allows her hair to be user friendly. I recommend this product to many people, those of whom tend to disregard my recommendation once I tell them the price. It&#x27;s worth it! No breakage, burns, or strong odors. Buy it! Buy it! I get ours from Sephora. My only complaint: there is no way I can get 2 applications from the jar. Long, thick hair makes this impossible.   Monae</li>
    <li> I used the PhytoRelaxer Index 2 for the very first time 2 days ago.  I am an African-American female.  My hair texture is not very fine, and not very coarse or thick.  I would say I have medium-textured hair.  In the past I have used regular strength relaxers and achieved good results.  My hair is long, probably 3-4 inches past my shoulders.  Prior to using the PhytoRelaxer, my hair was in decent shape; I would not describe it as damaged.  I do not have any hair coloring or other chemical process on my hair (besides a previous relaxer).  My hair was previously relaxed approximately 10 weeks ago.  I am EXTREMELY pleased with the results I got from using this relaxer!  The relaxer has a nice mild fragrance to it, almost a floral scent.  I even left the relaxer on my hair about 5 minutes longer than the directions stated, and there was no hair breakage or shedding.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After using the product, my hair feels very soft, shiny, bouncy with lots of movement, and BONE-STRAIGHT.  I like that because if my hair is this straight after using the relaxer, it means I won&#x27;t have to relax my hair again for several more weeks.  I have used other relaxers that leave my hair with a kind of hard, brittle feeling, but with this relaxer, even after using a blow-dryer and curling iron, the softness and shininess was still there.  What I&#x27;d like to do is post another review in a few weeks after I&#x27;ve washed my hair a few times and report back on how well the relaxer lasts.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this relaxer, and I plan to use it again in the future.  The price is a bit steep, but unfortunately you can&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere else.</li>
    <li> UPDATE November 15th 2007!&lt;br /&gt;---Hair still on head!  Wonderful.  So it has been about 6 months and I am still going strong.  No breakage, shedding, or dry hair.  I must say if you are looking for a truly gentle relaxer that will give you the results you want AND leave your hair healthy, then this is a must.  I gave the price issue a re-think and I think it is a financial \\&quot;wash\\&quot;.  I find I do not have to spend time and MORE $$$ searching, tyring, and buying products over and over again to repair the damage my \\&quot;other\\&quot; relaxers did in the past. Also I am a fan of natural hair products...[...]  has a GREAT shampoo and leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my final update.  :-)  As long as I update no more asume all is good!  Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE July 16th 2007!&lt;br /&gt;---I just got a retouch, used the index 2 again (it became less stuck to my head after about 1 or 2 washes).  Still good results...NO breakage, NO shedding, NO burning!!!!  Great shine, soft hair, GREAT results!!!  I am going to change my 4 stars opinion rating to a 5...It is well worth the money.....If you incorporate this with a 100% natural hair regimen then you are sure to have healthy bouncy shiny hair.  PLEaSE see the link to a GREAT site for 100% natural hair care products. [...]  [[ASIN:B000FH8834 Morrocco Method Natural Vegan Hair Care Package]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got my hair relaxed about 2 weeks ago using this $64.00 perm (Price with tax).  so far the results are fine.  My hair did nto burn at all while it was being applied by my stylist and I have washed it a few times since then and it is still straight and soft.  The ends are looking good as well.  FYI: I am afro american with kinky but fine hair...I do not use coloring (it takes my hair out as well as most other perms), I wear my hair in a bob about shoulder length.  The only complaint I have about the product BESIDES the price is maybe it made my hair too straight; I used the index 2.  I will give it about 4 - 5 more weeks and then see how it is doing...if it is still this straight I may try the index 1 next time.  I will be writing a follow-up review If I change to Index 1 and for sure after using the product for a 6 month period.  That is the real test for me.  Hope this helped.ng...if it is still this straight I may try the index 1 next time.  I will be writing a follow-up review If I change to Index 1 and for sure after using the product for a 6 month period.  That is the real test for me.  Hope this helped.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;m a Black woman from South America and my first relaxer was  Optimum (13 yrs ago), then I switched to Mizani 2 yrs ago.  Mizani was not good for my hair.  I started to shed alot.  I first heard about Phyto in Essence Magazine when Vanessa Williams mentioned she used it.  It took me a while to work up the courage, but I decided to try it last month. I took it to my stylist and she put it in.  I IMMEDIATELY saw and felt the difference.  My hair came out bone-straight. My hair felt lighter and had more movement to it once she finished. My stylist was amazed.  She wanted to know if it was sold in larger qty. The only caution I would give is to FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, otherwise, it&#x27;s a great investment in regards to the health and beauty of your hair.  It has been a month now and my hair is still looking great.  I usually do a retouch w/ my old perms with 2-3 mths, w/ Phyto, I hope to stretch that to 6 mths. I&#x27;m never returning to other perms!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used PhytoSpecific Relaxer index 2 twice.   I like it. This is the 1st relaxer that works with my \\&quot;kitchen\\&quot;  You know the nape of the hair that breaks off easily and does not seem to grow.  Well so far this relaxer has not broken off my \\&quot;kitchen\\&quot; hair.  I&#x27;m over 45, with strands of gray. So I&#x27;m not some kid that doesn&#x27;t have a clue regarding how hair texture changes over time and with age as my hair has.     I&#x27;m your typical african american female with black nappy hair.  I&#x27;ve used Optimum No Lye Relaxer for more than 10 years. I like it but frankly it burned, and kept breaking my \\&quot;kitchen\\&quot;  I knew I needed something different, but what?  Every other relaxer on the market was like a copy of the other with some little slight twist. I knew we black women needed something different. A breakthru.      I&#x27;ve been relaxing my own hair for years.  Why do it myself vs at a salon?  For several reasons: I could not take sitting hours in the hands of non professional stylist.  They make you wait, hours. They interleave you in with others.  My time and money is important to me.  I like professionalism and so far I haven&#x27;t found a salon that knows what professionalism means.  Its unfortunate. I&#x27;ve had more hair loss from going to the salon than just doing my hair myself. I&#x27;m paitent with myself. I don&#x27;t rush, and I follow the relaxer instructions to the letter.     So I&#x27;ve been on the quest for a relaxer that is easy on my hair but straightens it.     So far after two relaxer attemtps and no hair loss. I&#x27;m sold. The price of is worth it.  I get two relaxer applications from 1 box.     Now for those who say it dries their hair.  Are you following all the steps?  You have to put on hydration milk after you do the shampoo neutralizer. You have to use all of the Products in the box. All the products are in the box are in there for a reason.  Would you bake your favorite lemon cake without putting in the lemon extract? No.  So why would you skip not using something in your relaxer box.     Also, don&#x27;t mix and match relaxer products from brand a with brand b.     Now if  your hair is curly and not nappy, then why are you relaxing it? Do you know the difference between curly and nappy? The product could be too strong for you.  You&#x27;ve got to know your own hair. If you don&#x27;t then go to a salon and sit for 2 hrs and hopefully you&#x27;ll find out if they&#x27;ll tell you. Some will not. They want you to come back and back and back.     I knew index 2 was for me, because I know my hair.  But if you don&#x27;t, then go with index 1, if it doesn&#x27;t do the job. then go to index 2.  I also called the US PhytoSpecific Company in NY.  They answered my questions.  Why should I ask folks who don&#x27;t make the product about a product.     I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> First off - I&#x27;m Black, with kinky dry hair that would always revert within 4 weeks. I mean, I couldn&#x27;t even hot curl it straight! I have an active lifestyle, and generally wear my hair in a pseudo-fro with setting lotion and almond oil during the week, and I hot curl once a week.  This is the first time I didn&#x27;t have to touch-up my relaxer for 7 weeks!!! I am over the moon!  The price was a blow, but seven weeks later, it still looks great!  It&#x27;s more than worth the money and the time saved wastin&#x27; away at the b-shop!  Please try this product!  I didn&#x27;t notice a bad smell, there was no scalp irritation.  I have become a PhytoSpecific believer!  If I had known some flowers and herbs could do this for my hair, I would have been putting roses and Italian seasoning in my head!  :)  Good look to everyone who tries this.  I really hope it works for you.</li>
    <li> Ladies I happen to be a Haitian-American woman. I&#x27;ve been relaxing my course hair for 13yrs. I wash &amp; condition my hair weekly at a salon. I believe in quality products for my hair but I too am on a BUDGET. I read reviews, asked around; finally I went to PhytoUniverse in NYC &amp; got a free hair analysis before buying the perm to assure proper use etc.  They magnify your hair so you can see it for yourself (5min.).  They tell you what you&#x27;re doing correctly and where your hair needs help. They do not force products on you. I bought the ORGANIC relaxer &amp; my hairdresser w/15yrs exp. said it was the best; expensive, but worth the outcome I wanted.  It was great, no burning, no stiffness due to proper shampoo &amp; rinse. My hair was full of bounce and life.  Straight hair allows me more daily managability, but I needed a healthier hair product. The damage Lye causes wasn&#x27;t worth the $7.99 - $12.99 do it yourself brands.     CAUTION...Just follow the directions and never ever chemically process your own hair, you can&#x27;t avoid over processing it. Let a professional do it. Do not mix using metal utensil. Read directions for Do&#x27;s &amp; Don&#x27;ts. You pay more to remedy mishaps. Comb thru more and sit longer for straight hair. Massage don&#x27;t comb for texturizer effect for soft curls.If your hair dresser is licensed she should stock it and charge you.    My advise to all no matter what you use is to invest in vitamins for your hair because our diet affects our hair&#x27;s growth, get weekly treatments whether you chemically treat your hair or not because course hair needs more love and humectants, and do the research. PS try their Revitalizing Oil treatment prior to wash.  You&#x27;ll see difference from first use. I&#x27;ll skimp on shoes, clothes, household items, etc using coupons &amp; finding sales to insure I have enough to spare for great HEALTHY hair maintenance!</li>
    <li> I love this product especially when I&#x27;m in need of a touch-up.  In the past when I&#x27;m approaching time for a touch-up,  my hair would be very brittle, dry and I would have a lot of breakage.  Since I&#x27;ve switch to   Phyto, my hair is very manageable between touch-up.  I usually get a touch-up every 2 1/2 to 3 months (10 to 12 weeks).  My hair feels stronger and I experience a lot of hair growth since I switch 4 yrs ago.  Yes its expensive but my hair is worth it and I would change.</li>
    <li> See pictures and read my blog at [...]    Meet my hair:  Super thick, kinky to the nth degree, and reluctant to surrender to most straightening methods.  As a child, just when my mother and I thought my knappy knaps were a lost cause, they were duly humbled by the power of the lye relaxer.  That was at the tender age of 11.  Lye relaxing produced a beautifully tamed mane of hair with endless styling versatility.  Yippee!!    Now, I&#x27;ve been relaxing my hair for more than 35 of these years (mostly using lye relaxers).   Until recently, the last 25 years were exclusively lye relaxer years for me.   Since 2003, however, my hair has been the source of much D-R-A-M-A for me.  That was the year that I first noticed thinning--first on each side of my crown, followed, two years later, by two thin areas on each side of my temple.   As time went on, the thinning slowly worsened.    In addition to the thinning, the texture of my hair changed.  It became very wiry, gritty, and occasionally resistant to relaxing.  Conditioning and styling products which were previously very effective soon became useless.  So, I stopped coloring and began to spend a small fortune in the search of products to restore my hair back to its former glory.  I knew the lye relaxers weren&#x27;t helping matters, but I was at a loss for real solutions.  Switching to other kinds of relaxers scared me to no end.  I feared the thin spots would go bald and the only way out after that would be a collection of wigs (sorry, not a fan of fake hair).  Knowing that my relationship with lye relaxers couldn&#x27;t go on, in November of 2009, I desperately scoured the internet for any relaxer proven safe to use on previously lye relaxed hair, but would also successfully straighten my remaining coarse hair without further damage.  That&#x27;s when I ran across the multitude of user comments about Phyto Relaxer by PhytoSpecifics.  The next day I purchased the Index 1 Phyto Relaxer kit.  Fear of losing my money ($60/two applications) andmy hair paralyzed me.  So, the kit stayed in the bag with the receipt for three weeks . ..   (con&#x27;t with pictures in next blog)  Finally, I called the company&#x27;s support line.  That was probably the best thing I could have done.  The woman who answered the phone was extremely helpful.  After asking questions and putting together information about the texture of my hair, its current condition, and hearing my concerns, she assured me that it was safe to apply this product on hair previously relaxed with lye products.  Here were her suggestions:    1. Use the #2 kit to accommodate the coarseness of the hair  2. Begin the relaxing process by applying the relaxer to the healthiest, kinkiest areas first  3. Save the weak, thinning areas for last  4. Apply relaxer to new growth  5. Be sure to stay within the relaxing time limits  6. Don&#x27;t expect the hair to be \\&quot;bone straight\\&quot;  7. Wait 8 weeks between touch-ups</li>
    <li> I just recently started relaxing my hair, phyto relaxer Index II is the best relaxer in the entire world and works wonder on african american hait. My hair was sooo silky, full and vibrant and I got so many compliments. Thank You, phyto for such an excellent product please continue to make this wonderful product I will always be a customer:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American, whose hair was natural for 2years. However, I decided to straighten with phyto #2 because I did not want to use lye based products. I&#x27;m so happy I did, my hair is beautiful and I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on my hair. I&#x27;m also in love with the Moisturizing Styling Balm cream with Quinoa Oil.  I use it with heat, and it does not weigh my hair. In fact it provides awesome moisture and shine. My hair was so straight, but the next phyto relaxer I will use #1, because my hair is fine but with a lot of body.</li>
    <li> phytospecific relaxer is a  bit pricey but the old saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for,\\&quot;absolutely holds true in this case. The relaxer worked really well, I had no burns, complications, or the dry flaky scalp syndrome when getting a relaxer. My hair was Pin straight when finished, which I loved. I was suprised I achieved the results I wanted with such ease.  My hair felt a bit dry afterwards but  after applying the milky restructurer, my hair was soft again. I am a new convert as I will definately be using phyto relaxer as part of my hair regimen from here on out. .</li>
    <li> Update 7/9/07&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, my hair has been shedding tremendously.  I have noticed some breakage in the back area of my hair, I think I know what happened there.  Overall, I am not happy with the results.  My hair is more tangled after I wash it.  It still looks nice after styled, but the constant shedding from the roots is scaring me.</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought into all the hype surrounding this product... but that&#x27;s what happens when Oprah endorses something, lol... Anyway, this was a waste of money for me as a college student but I read all these great reviews from various sources and thought it might be worth a shot. WOW, was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Coming out of almost 4 months of a sew-in with no touch-ups last fall, I thought this would be a better way to relax the naps in my 4a/4b hair, but my tresses weren&#x27;t having it. I followed the directions to the letter and had a family friend who is a cosmetologist apply it on my hair, but it came out dry and just as nappy as if I hadn&#x27;t used any straightening process at all. So I had to go get a press just to avoid looking like Kunta Kente in the intermittent humidity that plagues my university town. That press, ironically, came out beautifully and all I used was Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair balm, Redken Heat Glide, and a dab of Vonte. Needless to say, I high-tailed it to my stylist ASAP for a trusty Paul Mitchell relaxer. Yet, almost 1 year later, the frizz still has not disappeared from my hair in the area that was treated with the Phyto Relaxer... and this is AFTER having at least 3 Paul Mitchell relaxers put over that area to make it straight again! It&#x27;s like this product only loosened my kinks into frizz and just made it more difficult to straighten- EVEN WITH A FLAT IRON!!! I will never use this again nor recommend it to anyone, but I do congratulate those who were lucky enough to have success with it. I&#x27;ll stick to Paul Mitchell because the price of getting a style and touch-up cost me the same amount as a box this junk and even his flat iron is in a league all its own.</li>
    <li> I am a white woman with thick unmanageable frizzy and curly (as opposed to cute curly) hair.  I have used this product about 3 times and it is *great*!!!  I get my hair highlighted and use #2.  But I only keep the formula on the minimum number of minutes.  Pay close attention to the minutes.  Once I did not and my hair was *very dry* afterwards.  (Then I just used one of Phyto&#x27;s great deep conditioners and slept with it on my hair for the next several times I washed my hair.)   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the salon relaxing products (specifically Rusk) and this is *far* superior). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it -- When will it be available again!!!!! It sells out *fast* everywhere on-line.</li>
    <li> I like this relaxer except for the price.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it doesn&#x27;t leave that \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell in the hair that other relaxers leave behind.  Although it seems easy to do it yourself, I have a professional apply it and I&#x27;ve had no hair loss and no damage at all. I&#x27;m in and out of the salon in less than an hour.   I&#x27;m 1/4 black and my hair is soft and curly (like Shirley Temple)- cute when the weather is nice, and a puffy, frizzy mess when it&#x27;s humid.  The relaxer makes it less puffy and less prone to frizz.  I don&#x27;t like it completely straight, so I only leave it in a maximum of 10 minutes from the start of the application.  This leaves my hair wavy so that it&#x27;s easy to blow dry straight or to wear curly.  When having the roots touched up, I use the phytospecific hair oil (revitalizing treatment) to protect the hair that has been previously relaxed.  That way there is no overlap and no damage.  One more thing, my hair is a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; texture (not super fine, but not coarse either).  I&#x27;ve used both index 1 and index 2 and haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> I am an African-American female with long, thick hair.  I relax and highlight my hair, so imagine the hell I was in when I heard that you should not chemically treat your hair when you are pregnant.  I tried to go along with that, however after 8 weeks I was in dire need of something.  I searched the web for a safe product and found this relaxer.  After rinsing it out and using the phyto shampoo and conditioner I was horrified with the fact that my hair felt like straw.  I rewashed it with Keracare shampoo and conditioner and it felt normal again.  The phyto relaxer did the same thing as a cheap drugstore relaxer, however it has a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t burn your scalp.  After doing 2 or 3 relaxers myself I started to notice breakage.  But I assumed that it was from being pregnant.  I stopped doing my own relaxers when my belly started to weigh me down entirely too much.  I called Phyto and they gave me a listing of salons that use the relaxer on clients.  The salon I went to explained to me that I didn&#x27;t understand placement when it comes to relaxer.  I was pretty much overlapping the product onto previously relaxed hair.  The instructions say not to do it, but it is really hard to control that.  I continued going to the salon for the relaxers and my hair grew back.   &lt;br /&gt;Now a year later, I continue to use the salon and the product.  I am breastfeeding my son, so I stay away from the chemicals still.  I suggest this relaxer to all of my pregnant friends that don&#x27;t want to walk around with crazy hair.  I mean pregnancy makes you feel bad enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m bi-racial with VERY thick combination 3A&amp;3B&amp;3C hair, a little past my shoulders. Because of the crazy mixture of wave patterns, I wanted to use a relaxer to kind of &#x27;even it out&#x27; and make the hair less &#x27;big&#x27;.     The first time I had this relaxer applied by a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; to my healthy virgin hair (no chemicals whatsover). She ended up being horrible, disregarding some of the imporant directions included with the relaxer; e.g. she cut my hair immediately before relaxing, left it on for over 50 minutes, put it directly on my scalp, and flat ironed it right after rinsing it out and drying it. Surprisingly, there was little to no damage to my hair, though it did burn my scalp. The second time I had this relaxer applied, I had a friend help me who claimed to know what she was doing. She, however, ended up applying the relaxer to not only the new growth, but the previously relaxed ends as well as my scalp. It burnt my scalp pretty bad, but again no damage. Both times, my hair turned out to be a much looser curl/wave, though not straight probably because directions weren&#x27;t followed (no smoothing/combing). It did make my hair lie flatter and less frizzy which is what I wanted.     Now I apply the relaxer on myself and although I tend to miss some spots, it works very well at making my hair less frizzy and more manageable.    I think the strength of this product lies in the fact that it&#x27;s not damaging unlike cheap dollar store perms. I have left it on for 30 minutes past the maximum recommended time, and still don&#x27;t have any breakage to show for it. My hair does feel sort of dry at the ends sometimes, but after I condition it well it&#x27;s nice and smooth. It still has body, and it&#x27;s still strong. Just make sure you follow the directions to the letter, SMOOTH the hair until you see your desired texture, and DON&#x27;T put it on your scalp.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ve reviewed Phytospecific relaxers on this site or not, but just in case, I&#x27;ll do it now.    I absolutely LOVE this relaxer.  I use index 2 on my hair that ranges from coarse to curly to wavy.  With this relaxer, I can airdry my hair and it&#x27;s still swingy and bouncy.  With others, I would have to flat iron it to get the stiffness out of my hair.  Because I flat iron much less, I don&#x27;t have as much breakage and have been able to retain length much easier.    I&#x27;m very cheap, but after using this perm, I cannot go back to the $8 drug store kits because I know I would not be satisfied.  :)</li>
    <li> Well its been a month since I first used the phytospecific relaxer. I previously left a review of my initial treatment and promised a followup. After the first two weeks I was somewhat disappointed because my hair would not hold a shape and I could not figure out why. It wasn&#x27;t until the third week when I got my hair cut that I realized two things. First, the phyto works so well that it straightened my hair too well- it was just too straight. This is probably great for women with longer hair but for short hair it really stayed flat and straight. Second, what I noticed right away was it left my hair in better condition than it was before and 100% better than traditional relaxers. Once I got my hair cut that was the trick to it turning out so well. What I also noticed was that unlike regular relaxers that would almost revert back to the curl or wave after a couple of weeks, the phyto relaxer has not only kept the straightened areas straighter but its lasting much longer and it doesnt \\&quot;fight\\&quot; with the new growth. The true test for me, will be the second touch up which I am planning the fifth week- in the next 7 days. With short hair, its more challenging to not overlap- actually its almost impossible not to at some point. So the test will be how it holds up to the touch up. I really do think its too expensive but I discovered that for short hair- you can get two treatments out of one box. Its one of those situations where you struggle with the cost despite how great the product is. I think they would sell more if they reduced the price to around $35-$40 or less. I say buy it but beware, if you follow the directions, you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 19 year old male and I&#x27;ve been using this relaxer for around a year. My hair is naturally curly and I wanted to have it straight--flat straight. When I tried the relaxer I was not very impressed because my hair still bent downwards, but then I realized even straight hair does this. Eventually, I realized too that I&#x27;d still need to use the flat-iron to get the hairstyle I wanted--which means that I relax my hair and use a flat iron. I also use the \\&quot;Phyto 9 botanical hydrating cream\\&quot; before blow-drying and cover my hair with VO-5 protector before using the iron. I like my hair. I really do &#x3D;) &lt;br /&gt;TIP: When the hair is relaxed, it adopts the position it is relaxed in. That means that if the hair is slightly curled, it WILL stay curled. Make sure, with a comb (the instructions say don&#x27;t use one, but I do and nothing has happened), to straighten every hair.</li>
    <li> As per request by a previous reviewer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Your race (black, white..etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my ETHNICITY: african-american&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Your hair texture (fine, coarse, curly, wavy...etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;extremely thick and wavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The condition of your hair prior to treatment (relaxed, damaged, color-treated...etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;severely damaged, dry, and previously relaxed every 6 weeks for 10 years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The condition of your hair after treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;soft, shiny, NO breakage, NO weakness, NO limpness, lots of body, more elasticity than before, swinging from side to side easily, straight at the root but not stick straight at the shaft, bouncy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Length of time you have been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 year on and off. I can&#x27;t afford it when I need a relaxer all of the time, so sometimes I purchased silk elements no-lye/lye, affirm or mizani. NONE of them are like this relaxer and I&#x27;m just going to have to keep using this one consistently so I can maintain top results with moisture and bounce.</li>
    <li> Hi, based on all the reviews I had read and prior experience with the regular Phyto line, I splurged and bought the product.  I was going to have my beauty salon apply it but decided I could not wait and would do it myself.  I have a lot of experience doing my own hair relaxing with other products such as Vertical (which I loved but cannot find anymore), Anticurl, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am white, with thick, coarse, frizzy hair.  I color it.  My hair is very resilient and takes well to abuse (for example I usually dry blow dry it on a daily basis with no ill effects) but not this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions outlined completely and left it on no longer than recommended.  My hair is  straight but it is so dry, it&#x27;s pathetic.  It is difficult to blow dry as it is so hard and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the product to be difficult to apply.  For example because my hair is rather short it is hard to section off, consequently, when I applied the product to small sections I found that the hair would mat up and make it hard to smooth out.  Also, the product was blended completely to a creamy peachy orange color yet when I applied it I would find little tiny why lumps of what I don&#x27;t know.  I could not figure why this was happening.  The ends of my hair look fried and are breaking in little pieces.  Thank God I don&#x27;t mind ultra short hair which is what I will have to get at the salon in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I tried this product about a month ago and I have not seen dramatic results.  I do appreciate the fact that the product is chemical free.  I will use it again to see if it will take more than a couple of applications to get the results I want.  My hair is almost gone in the center!  I needed to take a break from chemicals, I used this with the hair vitamins and my hair is actually growning back now --- nothing else produced results ... just remember that everything isnt everything with \\&quot;black hair\\&quot; you have to do research and see what works for your hair type and these reviews could be VERY helpful to you!</li>
    <li> Although \\&quot;frugal\\&quot; has GOT to be my middle name, I am a personal believer in splurging on products that better our state of being in a truly healthful way.  After years of relaxing my hair with the standard stuff, going natural and then relaxed once again--I feel as though I have finally come close to reaching hair Nirvana!  Now, I am going to rant a bit because I think almost every single person reading these reviews has felt as though s/he has allowed their hair to be compromised at one time or another or maybe even continuously due to a lack of a better option (or simply the knowledge of a better option).  I&#x27;m one of those women who has entrusted my tresses to family members, friends, and so-called \\&quot;professionals\\&quot; that had little stake in the health of my hair.  Like most of you, I have been burned, disregarded and frustrated, until now!  I am so totally amazed by this product (line) and am definitely a (life-long, perhaps) convert.  After using this relaxing system, my hair is beautiful, soft to the touch and truly MANAGEABLE!  Gone are the days of aching, scabbed over scalp and uncontrolled breakage and shedding.  If you have any experience treating your own hair, I feel comfortable in saying go for it--order this kit and see a marked difference in the condition of your scalp and hair.  In my experiences, the contents are surely enough for 2 applications (touch-ups), so in the long run, if you have been frequenting a salon, you could very well be SAVING quite a load of dough by using this particular system.  Here&#x27;s to good hair days EVERYDAY!  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I have eczema, so my scalp is very dry and sensitive. This relaxer burned my hair so severely I though it would fall out. I developed huge scores with thick scabs after having this relaxer professionally applied to my hair.</li>
    <li> First of all I am not your typical client- I am male, and caucasion. I have very course, short lenghted, combination wavy, straight hair that gets very dry and totally unmanageable. I discovered relaxer back when the brand Curl Free first came out- so its been about 20 years of the \\&quot;relaxer rollercoaster\\&quot;. Over the years the options have been limited, brands have come and gone and I have tried them all- I mean it, all of them!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was first in line for the over the counter brands that hit the market- lye, no lye, the stand alone relaxers from Sally&#x27;s and the kits. I then tried the more expensive hard to find Paul Mitchell- and then the Rusk product. All of them were hit and miss. Sometimes the results were great and the next was a chemical haircut. I think that every box should have come with a bottle of Valium because of the stress of not knowing what I would expect. While rinsing, I would wipe my eyes in anticipation of seeing pieces of hair at the bottom of the sink.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I then wanted my hair to grow longer and as it so difficult to apply the relaxer to only new growth I started going to Vidal Sasoon on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, CA and spent $100 a pop for a relaxer and hair cut- what a rip. The process took hours and the results were not much different than what I did on my own for $90 less. The bottom line is that professional application isn&#x27;t much better. The only advantage is they can get to all areas of your head. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried the infomercial products- RIO and I think there was another thats since gone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried the perm type relaxer thinking it would be less damaging and surprisingly it seemed to do more damage than the relaxer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I went to Craigs list and in the beauty postings asked advise for a relaxer and someone responded with Phytospecific. I had definite sticker shock- $60 is really a huge price jump from the $6-$10 bucks for over the counter relaxer so because of the price I searched and searched the internet for reviews. I have to tell you I was really shocked to read so many positive reviews- I actually thought they were fake postings- maybe they are, but with so many it seemed unlikely. So, reluctantly risking the loss of $60 and more importantly another disappointment, I ordered it and received it yesterday.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I knew what the preparation was to be from reading about the application, I stopped coloring my hair about 2 weeks prior- looked like hell but thank god for ball caps. Condition my hair daily and stopped washing my hair three days before the product arrived. The last over the counter relaxer I used was about 8 weeks ago- long over due- lots of new growth, but haven&#x27;t had a hair cut so about half of my hair length is old relaxer, my worry was breakage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I followed the directions exactly- using the course version, and after rinsing and conditioning there was not one piece- not one hair was broken. I was totally amazed. I have to repeat this again, not one piece of hair was broken!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So far I am experiencing the typical flat to the scalp hair, and conditioning the heck out of it. The hair is really rough right after shampooing- really rough, and the conditioner that comes with it doesn&#x27;t seem to help when applied but keeping it on about 15 min longer than the direction say and rinsing, the hair become soft. I added more conditioner and Johnson&#x27;s baby detangler and so far it seems good. Of course, the next few days will be the true test but I wanted to post a review asap for those considering to buy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am hoping this will be the one that works, but the true test for me will be the next several days, and the biggest test will be after the next application in about 7 weeks. I will follow up but if your like me and have no choice but to relax this seems to do the least damage- and actually no damage was noticed at all, as mentioned- which at this point seems worth it but to be honest I am hoping it will last a few weeks longer than regular relaxer since its so expensive. The one down side to finding good products is they cost- but in this case you get what you pay for. Check back here for a follow up on my progress.</li>
    <li> I am black American and have combination hair...nappy, wavy and straight.  I&#x27;ve been using drug store relaxers for over 30 years (Crème of Nature, TCB, Dark &amp; Lovely, Revlon Realistic) whatever is \\&quot;on sale\\&quot; with satisfying results.   These products leave my hair evenly straight and shiny but hard and stiff immediately after the process.  I usually wash my hair after a few days (I like to give it a rest after relaxing) and use a good conditioner to soften and detangle.  From there I am able to go about 12 weeks before having to retouch.  In general my hair is healthy and responds well to straightners.  My biggest expense is with conditioning products to maintain my hair.  I&#x27;ll try anything and spend any amount if it works well on my hair.  I have great success with Frederic Fekkai products and love Phytodefrisant Botanical Hair Relaxing Balm...this stuff is amazing if you like to wash and go (air dry) and it works wonders with blow drying/flat ironing too.  (Bumble and Bumble Styling Spray is another amazing product for great flat ironing results.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I forked out $60 to try Phtyo2 after reading all the rave reviews.  I am satisfied with the outcome but not blown away.  Yes, Phyto2 did not smell bad, it did not burn my scalp and it did straighten my hair but no better than Dark and Lovely or TCB, and my hair was still hard and stiff afterward. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has been several weeks and my hair is doing great, but again no different from when I use Dark &amp; Lovely.  I guess I am lucky that my hair responds well to ANY type of relaxer so I doubt I&#x27;ll be spending another $60 for Phyto2...I&#x27;d rather buy two tubes of Phytodefrisant Balm and continue to with my $7.99 drug store brands.  I hope this helps someone with similar hair as mine.  If you do well with drug store brands, Phyto results are not that different...spend the money on their other products that nourish and condition your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read nothing but smashing reviews about this relaxer and decided to spend the 10 bucks and try it my self. I have alot of hair, but its very fine. It used to get fairly straight with relaxers but as of the past few years its become basicly resistant to any chemicals I use on it. &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatly this was no expection. It made my curls looser, but not straight or even wavy for that matter. I got the same results from this as I had with any other 10 dollar relaxer.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most expensive relaxer I&#x27;ve ever used and it is worth every penny.  I first heard of it as being Oprah&#x27;s relaxer so I decided to hunt it down.  One of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done.  I have very coarse, thick \\&quot;horsehair\\&quot; that usually defeats most over the counter perms after a few washings.  Not Phytospecific&#x27;s relaxer.  My hair stayed soft AND STRAIGHT no matter what the weather or I did to it. And it&#x27;s the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been.  No other relaxer ever did that for my hair.  In fact they usually made it worse! I absolutely love the Phytorelaxer and I am officially addicted.  If it were less pricey, it would get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on various websites and magazines.  I wanted to try Phyto because of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; tagline.  Like other people, the price tag made me nervous...never the less, I tried it.  First, I had to use the entire mixture, no half stuff for me. I have very thick hair. It didn&#x27;t burn at all...which was surprising! It did take 5 shampoos to get the mixture out and my hair was hard.  The reconstructor is great!  I may try some of the haircare line.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleasd with the results but I&#x27;m not sure if I am willing to fork out 60 bucks every six weeks and do the work at home vs going to a salon and paying the same amount to let someone else do the work.

    <li> Race: Black American  Hair type: 4b (kinky, tight curl pattern, medium diameter)    Pros: Gentle on the scalp; easier to control straightening, so hair does not have to be bone strait; smell is not as strong as with other relaxers.    Cons: Breakage over time; claims to be \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; are not really valid; expensive and can be difficult to buy and find a professional who will apply it.    This is the first relaxer that I used after having been natural for more than 8 years.  When I first applied the relaxer, I loved it.  It did not burn, and my hair felt full and strong.  It had life and body. Now I&#x27;ve been using the relaxer for about 10 months.  I&#x27;ve experienced alot of breakage in the past two months.  When I first had the relaxer applied, my hair was about 2 inches past the shoulders.  After 10 months, I was hoping to gain at least 3 inches of length, but I actually lost about 1 or so inches off the longest part of my hair and even more in other parts.  I finally got it cut to about chin lengh with layers to even out the breakage.  I&#x27;ve decided to give this up and go with another relaxer.    I believe that this a form of a no-lye relaxer.  The inductor (orange liquid) contains guanidine carbonate, which is used with calcium hydroxide to create an alternative to sodium hydroxide or \\&quot;lye\\&quot; relaxers.  No-lye relaxers feel gentler on the scalp but can sometimes be drying for the hair over time.  I believe that this is what is causing my breakage.     Note: I am in no way a professional, but I do like to research anything that I put on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first relaxer I&#x27;ve ever used at home and it works great. It&#x27;s really easy to use and works fast while doing a good job. Hair looks naturally straight not cardboard straight. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I used Phytospecific Relaxer on my virgin hair during the summer (2006). I first thought it to be a great investment ($60) and worth the cost. After use, I found my hair to be relaxed but not \\&quot;bone straight\\&quot; as I&#x27;ve experienced with other relaxers which is what I desired. My hair is very soft and fine and quite sensitive to chemicals so I was in search of a product that would straighten my hair and not leave any damaging affects. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the 2nd treatment (September 2006), I soon found that my hair was experiencing breakage around the temples and severe breakage at the nape of my neck. I quit using the product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this product works for some but as mentioned earlier, my hair is quite sensitive to chemicals and unfortunately, I experienced hair loss! So, it&#x27;s back to the drawing (or growing) board for me!</li>
    <li> I used this relaxer for the first time after using many brand name ones. I was impressed with the results. It leaft my hair with much needed moisture, and very shiny. I normally apply the realxer myself at home, but I choose to go professional to really capture the promises that this product states. The smell was not noticeable, which was good since most chemicals are so harsh and strong. It didn&#x27;t burn my scalp like most have. The quantity was ample considering that most relaxers are cheap with the amount they give I think that it was worth the price! I&#x27;ll be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with many of the reviews here. it doesn&#x27;t burn you hair and this is the softest I have had my hair after a relaxer. I love this one because it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as the others nor does it strip your hair like many of the others. The milk conditioner in the end is marvelous. I have to say this is the best I have used. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been doing hair professionally for over 10 years. I have used several relaxers on myself and clients. I first heard about this in a mag interview with Vanessa Williams and was intrigued. It took me some time before I decided to buy. I am African American and have very thick hair. My hair is not \\&quot;nappy\\&quot; but it is coarse and is hard to evenly straighten. This product DELIVERS. I read some reviews from some people who I beleive bought the wrong index. I am still watching the results to see if it can deliver long term health, but it&#x27;s been about a week and my hair is manageable, and it is STRAIGHT. The only thing that I would say is that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft as it has with the lye relaxers, so I&#x27;m still watching...I do however like the fact that although my hair is straight it did not take away from the thickness. It also has a nice shine. With lye relaxers sometimes in an endeavour to get it straight, it ends up stuck to your head with no life and volume. This is totally opposite. Yes, it is pricey, but my hair is worth it, and I&#x27;m not an advocate of clients retouching every 4 weeks. For the health of any hair, I encourage my clients to try and go 6 to eight weeks. I know I wait about 3 months, so that should defray costs.</li>
    <li> Ok, I have thick, thick, thick, coarse African-American hair. I have tried different relaxers all my life and they would just not work. I thought that I would be destined to a life of braids because my hair was sooooo unmanageble. Hair dressers would huff and puff while doing my hair and wonder why they could not tame it. Seriously, I have the worst, most resistant hair imaginable.    After I had taken my braids out I waited a week and put this relaxer on virgin hair that was used to regular braiding for about 2 years. I must say I was not impressed at first. It was straight but not bone straight. I believe this is due to the damage that was done by keeping my hair in braids for so long. Also, this product does not break the bonds in your hair like regular relaxers, it relaxes the tight coil curls. This is so much better for your hair.     After 8 weeks I did a touch up and the roots were seriously striaght. When my hair was wet you could see a definate difference betweeen the new growth and the rest of my hair. 10 weeks after that I did another touch up and I was amazed at how good my hair looks! If you have hair like mine you will need to smooth it with a flat iron, I suggest a ceramic one like the Maxi-Glide that has a comb attachment. My hair has more body, it does not just lay flat and limp against your head. Using Wen cleansing conditioner in conjuntion with the phytorelaxer has also helped my hair have bounce and shine and managability. I do not recommend waiting 10 weeks for a touch-up for most people but I have been taking the Phyto brand hair vitamins for the past 4 months and and ever since then my new growth has been more manageable and stronger.I have very minimal shedding.    I am not trying to push products here but if you have hair like this and you have tried everything and nothing works and it almost brings you to tears sometimes, I&#x27;m telling you try these things I suggest. A weight will be lifted and you can enjoy having beautiful hair like otherpeople do.    This product does have a little smell to it but NOTHING like regular relaxers. It has never burned or irritated my scalp either.</li>
    <li> I bought this relaxer and did it myself at home about 2 years ago. At the time, the price was only $44 (which is still pretty steep). The reviews said it was great and I could not have ben more pleased with the product. Never in my life had I had truly \\&quot;wash-and-go\\&quot; hair. Before this with other relaxers, I could wash - but I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere for three hours at least. This relaxer cut down on my styling time, product use and actually left my hair in amazing condition  - plus gorgeous! Then the next time I went to buy the relaxer, the price jumped a whopping 40% to $60. I didn&#x27;t want to part with that much money. I thought I could \\&quot;make do\\&quot; with a less expensive brand. I tried Mizani and Affirm. NOTHING WAS LIKE MY PHYTO. So back I came and here I&#x27;ll stay. Not even the salon could replicate the results I recieve with my Phyto relaxer. Straight, soft smoooth, frizz free. Just perfect.</li>
    <li> I rated this neutral so that I could just make this comment to future reviewers: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When reviewing a product such as this, it would be helpful if you all would give the following information in your reviews: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Your race (black, white..etc) &lt;br /&gt;2. Your hair texture (fine, coarse, curly, wavy...etc) &lt;br /&gt;3. The condition of your hair prior to treatment (relaxed, damaged, color-treated...etc) &lt;br /&gt;4. The condition of your hair after treatment. &lt;br /&gt;5. Length of time you have been using this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the information we need in order to compare to our situations and make an informed decision on whether or not to try this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So far, only one review has these elements.  Future reviewers, PLEASE give as detailed a review as possible (whether it&#x27;s good or bad).  What we put in our hair is a serious matter.  Thanks:)</li>
    <li> ok, so i read all the reviews and wished that i had been using this product 2 yrs ago when i decided that i would never buy a dollar store perm again. i was using Rusk perm and i was great because i really did not like the bone straight look but has i used it it seemed that my hair would break off a lot and i was seeing hair in some places on my head that was really short. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the perm or maybe it was that bad hair color that i used witch really messed up my hair. but still my hair was breaking off every wear my husband even would say my hair is every where in the house. the daily thing was to whip my split ends from my shoulders every time i would fix my hair. so i waited my 90 days and switch to this product and it really surprised me that my hair looks as good the difference is that it&#x27;s shine, Boucher, and it&#x27;s only been 2 days but my hair is not braking off as much. it&#x27;s really a lot of money for me to send and my other relaxer was cheaper but you get what you pay for. i used all of it this time but next time I&#x27;ll use only use half and use the other half for my next time. so really i till spend the same. i am much happier with this product and now this is what i&#x27;ll use. I&#x27;m waiting for summer to see how it holds up to the Florida summers . i think it will do great monique Florida</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman with very thick, curly, wavy and coarse hair. It looks great when freshly blown dry, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to get it puffy and frizzy. High humidity and wind are my arch-enemies! My hair is a bit dry from daily blowdryer use and permanent haircolor every 4 weeks or so, but otherwise is in good shape.      In the past I&#x27;ve had a thio relaxer (the Fantastic Sam&#x27;s salon house brand), a lye relaxer (Motions brand, which fried my hair), and a thio-based thermal conditioner (Grund brand, which cost $400 and left me with bald spots and other extreme breakage. That was 18 months ago and all of it has grown out and been trimmed off).       I bought the Phyto 2 relaxer after reading lots of favorable reviews of it. My goal was to retain my hair&#x27;s fullness and eliminate the frizz. When the product arrived, I read the instructions and waited until 3 weeks had passed since my last haircolor. Then I called my stylist and hoped for the best. (No way was I going to risk damaging my own hair!)     After my stylist examined the contents and read the instructions, she was impressed by the high quantity. She left the relaxer on for the full 20 minutes or so. Because my hair is so thick, it took several washes (shampoo is included) to get all of the relaxer and neutralizer out, and she used the entire contents of the package. But it was worth it! During the rinsing and styling, she was amazed by how soft it made my hair, and there was NO breakage!     Unlike with other relaxers, my hair retained some volume and is not pin-straight AND it&#x27;s soft, shiny, and in better condition than before. It had a slight eggy-chemical smell, which disappeared the day after I washed it.     My hair is in such good shape that my stylist was able to touch up the roots 4 days later with *permanent* color. That would&#x27;ve been unthinkable with other relaxers!    I paid $60 (plus shipping and handling) for the product and $75 for my stylist, for a total of $135. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive; butconsidering the quality, I think it&#x27;s money well spent.    FOLLOW-UP (4/3/10):    I&#x27;ve had three touch-ups since I wrote the above review. The first touch-up was done approximately 9 months after the original application, by the same stylist. The results weren&#x27;t nearly as good as the first time. The new growth was dry and not as straight as the previously relaxed hair.     The second touch-up was done quite a while after the first one. This time the new growth was dry and some of the ends were kinky and fried. I thought my stylist (the same person) did something wrong.     The  third touch-up (3/6/09) was actually a new whole-head application, and it was done over a year after the previous touch-up, by a different stylist (who also has lots of experience with relaxers). Bad news. All my hair was kinky and fried AND my scalp itched hellaciously for months.    It&#x27;s been over a year now, and the itching has eased up, but all my hair is dry and kinky. Not even weekly deep conditioning and the occasional flat-ironing help much. Maybe it&#x27;s related to menopause. I&#x27;m thinking of getting my hair relaxed again, but not with Phytospecific!</li>
    <li> I agree with the person who wrote that it is \\&quot;by far the most expensive relaxer\\&quot; I&#x27;ve ever bought but it is worth it. My mum was the one who found it and I&#x27;m eternally grateful to her as it worked out fantastic. Thanx Mum :)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am used to using various box relaxers from the store (Gentle Treatment, TCB, Dark and Lovely etc) and none of these come close. I have a combination of European/Carribean hair which is thick and coarse and so I need a really good relaxer to make it soft and straight.My hair has never been this straight from a box relaxer and it actually moves! :) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is none of the usual \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation that often goes along with most relaxers. Nor is there a strong overwhelming smell that is enough to knock you out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The quantity of the contents is great aswell. There are very few relaxers that you find with enough Conditioner provided to be used again later on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the price.My personal experience gave Salon results at a slightly cheaper price yet more expensive than those sold at Walgreens. I&#x27;ll stick with the Phytorelaxer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have bought this product and it works really well.  I love it, but I hate the price of this relaxer.  Every 8 weeks I am spending $60 for 1 box.  I am not rich, and this is too costly, so I searched high and low for an alternative relaxer.  Phytorelaxer boasts about using Guanidine Carbonate, egg and soy.  No calcium hydroxide.  I found that Africa&#x27;s Best Organics No-Lye Organic Conditioning Relaxer System, Regular, has Guanidine Carbonate Calcium Hydroxide, Egg Protein, Soybean Oil, Shea Butter, Silk Protein, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E, Olive Oil, Mink Oil, Carrot Oil, Cholesterol, Honey and Herbs. I put in the product today 8/24/07, and I love it, love it, love it.  After using the shampoo in the box, I used Motions Neutralizing Shampoo, then Africa&#x27;s Best Hair Mayonnaise, then Africa&#x27;s Best Organics Olive Oil Dry Hair and Scalp Therapy.  And guess what it cost me about $25 for all of the products combined.  The only difference between Phytorelaxer and Africa&#x27;s Best Organics Relaxer is the fact that it has calcium hydroxide in it.  I think if you can find a decalcifying shampoo, problem solved.  Oh yeah I called the company and found that the ph level was between 12.5 to 13.  If you want more information about this company go to houseofcheatham.com  And for all wondering I do not work for the company, I just could not take the price of phytorelaxer anymore.  If phytorelaxer was a reasonable price, I would pick that relaxer over all others.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m black, have kinky hair, and i&#x27;ve been relaxing my hair for about 25 years. i&#x27;ve used many many types of relaxers to my dismay:- hair falling out, breaking, dry, etc. &lt;br /&gt;so i let my hair \\&quot;rest\\&quot; for about 5 years then i tried the relaxer thing again after i found phyto. i&#x27;ve been doing my own hair now for about 1 year, and it&#x27;s been great!- except for the price. my hair still feels as if it has life in it, it it is not breaking, it is not falling out. it burns like regular straightener. i use vinegar to neutralize it, then use the neutralizing shampoo with indicator to check for pink. please, there&#x27;s not enough neutralizing shampoo to get rid of the staraightener. &lt;br /&gt;the price is scary, but i&#x27;m more afraid of having my hair fall out and having to fix that.  &lt;br /&gt;soon, i&#x27;ll have to get a hairdresser though, because my hair has now been retaining it&#x27;s length and growing - and it&#x27;s harder to straighten it myself. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This relaxer got my hair the softest it&#x27;s ever been, and it stayed that way for weeks, even when I braided my hair and took them out it was still soft. And it came out really straight too, I had to smooth it for a long time though. But it never burned not once. My hair came out a nice new texture. I&#x27;ve tried no-lye and lye perms and this perm beats both of them. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was after my hair dried, my ends were frizzy  but that could have been my fought. And like I say, my hair wasn&#x27;t virgin hair. I think if there&#x27;s a salon that does these perms, get it done professionally. I highly recommend this relaxer!</li>
    <li> This is the best relaxer I have used. It does the job and doesn&#x27;t burn you hair. Definitely worth the money!</li>
