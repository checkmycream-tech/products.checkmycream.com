      <li>I have been using this soap for many years.  </li>
      <li>Lovely smell</li>
      <li>Great for my whole body including my face</li>
      <li>Love this soap.</li>
      <li>FANTASTIC stuff!</li>
      <li>After trying many products over the counter and prescribed, I have found myself allergic to benzyl peroxide and salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>u feeling very very clean</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s strong.  </li>
      <li>Very good for dry skin.</li>
      <li>She uses it regularly now and is working great</li>
      <li>this soap is so refreshing, I have been using the soap for awhile, and is mild and fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>I have cystic acne, and it has reduced the size of the cysts significantly.  </li>
      <li>My face feels extremely clean using this product</li>
      <li>I recommend this soap to anyone looking to have fresh, moisturized skin as well as remove light scarring.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s to early to tell if it&#x27;s doing anything, but it has a nice smell to it.</li>
      <li>Love the soap, gives excellent medicinal effects; such as reduction of dark pigmentation, reduction of blemishes, and possess vitamins for the skin.</li>
      <li>My face is really sensitive, so being able to use it on my face as well without any breakouts happening, makes it a winner for me as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>So definitely I will have to purchase more from the company.  </li>
      <li>I got severely sunburnt on my face within the first month and that is what prompted me to try out the soap.</li>
      <li>He didn&#x27;t recommend this exact brand</li>
      <li>Better than that stuff in stores and one bar lasts a very long time.</li>
      <li>Thanks Nubian Heritage.</li>
      <li>It is very pricey sending just one  soap to Brazil.......</li>
      <li>My skin is very sesetive, and I used this with no problems or breakouts.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It leaves my body feeling clean and when I say clean, I mean clean.</li>
      <li>A little drying so make sure you moisture after, or put on shea butter on your face.  </li>
      <li>Worked really well for the first use and cleared up my acne, but I missed one day and it seemed like I got double the amount of acne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pale, I barely count as Caucasian : )</li>
      <li>and I could see my skin become smoother and my pimples start to dry up within the first 3 days.  </li>
      <li>It does dry your skin out if you over use it, so you need to be aware of what your skin can handle and use it accordingly.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more African Black Soup in the future...</li>
      <li>Other than I&#x27;M very satisfy customer because of my nephew getting better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It reduced the burnt skin by about 90% in two weeks, smoothed my whole face and has completely removed most of my acne scars (they were not that bad to begin with).</li>
      <li>The first few times I used it I could feel my pores opening.  </li>
      <li>I believe it has helped clear up some severe dry patches/eczema on my legs.  </li>

<li> Will try some of their other soaps with my next Amazon order</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore.</li>
<li> I bought this after reading great reviews that it helps with acne, I&#x27;m sad to sad</li>
<li> My son and husband use this for their dry skin.  </li>

<li> Also the swelling is minimal and goes away naturally after a few days.</li>
<li> Yes, I still get breakouts, but they are mild in comparison to what I used to get, and they clear up within a few days instead of dragging on and getting worse with each new product I tried making it worse.</li>
<li> I am going to use this one to wash my face and the other to bathe with...</li>
<li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other soap.</li>
<li> I chucked all my other body washes.</li>
<li> It may be a little agressive for facial use as I found the hard way.  </li>
<li> I brought this one and the Honey and Black Seed Soup</li>
<li> like to keep in a little dish in the shower so it doesn&#x27;t leave a black mess on the tub or soap</li>
<li> I tried it a little too on skin spots and they seem to be fading.</li>
<li> No more looking for other products, I have found the one for me.</li>
<li> I will update my post in a few weeks.</li>
<li> My mom told me that his Rashes is disappearing slowly and less itchiness...  </li>
<li> /&gt;it is only a bit expensive.</li>
<li> Winter there was really hard on my skin.</li>
<li> I have sent the soap to nephew who suffer from some weird allergic reaction on his skin in Brazil.  </li>
<li> but I get scratch marks from the nuts or whatever those pieces are :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this soap is so refreshing, I have been using the soap for awhile, and is mild and fresh smelling.</li>
    <li> Great soap. Cleans well and conditions the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for many years.  It is great!</li>
    <li> This product is soooo amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my body feeling clean and when I say clean, I mean clean. I use this product on my face and body during my shower and I feel so revitalized once my shower is finished. My face is really sensitive, so being able to use it on my face as well without any breakouts happening, makes it a winner for me as well. I would definitely recommend getting this and using it to replace your bathing soap, but also give it a try as a face cleaner.</li>
    <li> Great product, skin blemishes clearing up, smell like a boss stepping out of the shower.</li>
    <li> My son and husband use this for their dry skin.  They absolutely love it!  I plan on ordering another soap product for myself!</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes a lot of suds</li>
    <li> Worked really well for the first use and cleared up my acne, but I missed one day and it seemed like I got double the amount of acne.</li>
    <li> The only soap I use after I discovered it period. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love the soap, gives excellent medicinal effects; such as reduction of dark pigmentation, reduction of blemishes, and possess vitamins for the skin. A product for both men and women to use, the only downside is that the bar soap dissolves faster while the liquid preserves longer so I would recommend buying the liquid instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading great reviews that it helps with acne, I&#x27;m sad to sad it hasn&#x27;t helped mine. I bought it in a three pack and will keep it for the kiddos to use. It has a really nice scent, just didn&#x27;t do what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> soap is good but I get scratch marks from the nuts or whatever those pieces are :(</li>
    <li> LOVE this soap!  it has converted me from liquid body soap to a bar again...FANTASTIC stuff!</li>
    <li> this is a very good soap and smells great leaves u feeling very very clean</li>
    <li> Great product - leaves my skin smooth and smells amazing</li>
    <li> I chucked all my other body washes. Nothing else to say</li>
    <li> The soap works great.  It has an earthy smell to it which I like and it&#x27;s strong.  The first few times I used it I could feel my pores opening.  It may be a little agressive for facial use as I found the hard way.  My face started to peel but aside from that I love it.</li>
    <li> the soap is very good, i like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;perhaps i will buy it once more.&lt;br /&gt;it is only a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> great product! buy it often.</li>
    <li> Thank Lil Wayne because I would have never bought this if he didn&#x27;t recommend it. He didn&#x27;t recommend this exact brand but regardless I like the product, it leaves my skin nice and smooth and after I take a shower or wash my hands or face my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I STILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Yes, I still get breakouts, but they are mild in comparison to what I used to get, and they clear up within a few days instead of dragging on and getting worse with each new product I tried making it worse. My cystic acne had cleared up. I may get one once in a while, but my face does not get red or blotchy. Also the swelling is minimal and goes away naturally after a few days. I use the soap 2 times a day, I put on some witch hazel with a cotton ball after washing my face. I them moisturize with cetaphil cream. No more looking for other products, I have found the one for me. I wish I knew about this years ago.  Impressive. I have only used this for about a week and I could see my skin become smoother and my pimples start to dry up within the first 3 days.  My skin is very sesetive, and I used this with no problems or breakouts.  It does dry your skin out if you over use it, so you need to be aware of what your skin can handle and use it accordingly.  Also, you should pair it with a good moisturizer after washing you face.  I have cystic acne, and it has reduced the size of the cysts significantly.  I have tried everything that there is to try, and nothing has worked for me.  After trying many products over the counter and prescribed, I have found myself allergic to benzyl peroxide and salicylic acid. I don&#x27;t know if this will take all the acne away, but it sure is a great start.  I will update my post in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this product prior to my deployment to the Middle East. I got severely sunburnt on my face within the first month and that is what prompted me to try out the soap. It reduced the burnt skin by about 90% in two weeks, smoothed my whole face and has completely removed most of my acne scars (they were not that bad to begin with). I recommend this soap to anyone looking to have fresh, moisturized skin as well as remove light scarring. I did not try it on my body because &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; affects my pH.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  I believe it has helped clear up some severe dry patches/eczema on my legs.  Lathers nicely and rinses off well.  Will try some of their other soaps with my next Amazon order</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s to early to tell if it&#x27;s doing anything, but it has a nice smell to it.</li>
    <li> This cleared up a ezema breakup on my daughters kin in a couple days. She uses it regularly now and is working great and she likes the smell. We tried other natural solutions but this is the only one that works. Thanks Nubian Heritage. I tried it a little too on skin spots and they seem to be fading.</li>
    <li> I brought this one and the Honey and Black Seed Soup and I have to say I like this one better...I am going to use this one to wash my face and the other to bathe with...I will definitely be ordering more African Black Soup in the future...</li>
    <li> My son ueses this this was his request</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other soap. Discovered this at an African Festival in Chicago. Winter there was really hard on my skin. All I can say is try it, you will like it &amp; love how your skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep in a little dish in the shower so it doesn&#x27;t leave a black mess on the tub or soap holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - this is for people of any ethnicity. I&#x27;m so pale, I barely count as Caucasian : )</li>
    <li> WASHES CLEAN--NO OILY OVERPRODUCTION</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, leaves my skin feeling good, not aggressive on oil (scalp and facial oil) so scrub a bit</li>
    <li> Lovely smell but I didn&#x27;t see any results after a month of using only this.</li>
    <li> Nice..A little drying so make sure you moisture after, or put on shea butter on your face.  My face feels extremely clean using this product</li>
    <li> I have sent the soap to nephew who suffer from some weird allergic reaction on his skin in Brazil.  So far the NUBIAN HERITAGE AFRICAN BLACK SOAP has done well for his skin.......... My mom told me that his Rashes is disappearing slowly and less itchiness...  So definitely I will have to purchase more from the company.  Other than I&#x27;M very satisfy customer because of my nephew getting better.&lt;br /&gt; It is very pricey sending just one  soap to Brazil.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God bless you and hope this Soap help others that have the same case my nephew is going through..........</li>
    <li> Great soap, have bought it before. Everyone in the family loves it.</li>
    <li> I liked this soap in the beginning. It started to break me out after several weeks of use.  You have to moisturize after using.  It will strip oils from your skin and dry you out.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Very good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Cleared up the bumps on my upper arms in 2 weeks! Smells delish! Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome soap! Great for my whole body including my face</li>
    <li> Better than that stuff in stores and one bar lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  The smell is so nice and it leathers really good.  I would buy again.</li>
