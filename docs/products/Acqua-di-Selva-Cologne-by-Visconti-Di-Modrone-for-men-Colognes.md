      <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I also enjoy the smell when he wears it!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Seems more like &#x27;after-shave&#x27; than cologne.</li>
      <li>I have not seen it in many years and decided to try it again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Acqua Di Selva for over 20 years, and it&#x27;s my all time favorite.  </li>
      <li>I use this cologne for the last 45 years ever since a girl told me I was smelling great!</li>
      <li>If you like the vetiver oil, you will love this cologne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon sells it.</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>though a family member of mine got me into it many years ago.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly a blend of lemon oil,pine,and vetiver grass all coming out in generous portions.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this cologne.</li>
      <li>Its refreshing</li>
      <li>I sampled and regularly purchased this wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I have been using it since college days; I turned 60 Friday, and it is still my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>My favorite lotion.</li>

      <li>Love it, been using it for 50 years.</li>
      <li>Fresh impact !!</li>
      <li>The problem I have with most colognes is that the top note is too strong and leaves a strong trail.</li>
      <li>So glad it&#x27;s still available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad it is still available in the United States.</li>
      <li>dayDoesn&#x27;t remind me of NYSE but more of german/swiss architecture and dimly light studies surrounded by leather-bound books..</li>
      <li>, I wish more of the line was available like soap deodorant, shave balm etc.</li>
      <li>This is good if you&#x27;re one of those guys who habitually applies too much aftershave or cologne.  </li>
      <li>Over the years it never fails to bring back so many wonderful memories.  </li>
      <li>It makes a nice aftershave and has a light fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Think outdoorsy (to an extent) but more clean cut or aristocratic in</li>
      <li>Aqua Di Silva is just a good old favorite</li>
      <li>This is not necessarily a bad thing, as many folks don&#x27;t like to be around long-lasting strong scents.</li>
      <li>Nice fresh clean scent.</li>
      <li>that the fragrance was not  as strong as when  formulated by the original company Victor.</li>
      <li>I believe if it is still available when he runs out-</li>
      <li>You can smell this lightly on yourself and someone close can smell it</li>
      <li>He liked it so much that he adopted it as his signature scent.  </li>
      <li>This is a great value and he loved that it lasts much longer than the spray--who said you can&#x27;t teach an old dog new tricks!</li>
      <li>Almost smells like you just getting out of a fresh clean shower!</li>
      <li>when I found it online, I rushed to buy it, although some mentioned that it does not smell like the original.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product more than 40 years ago.  </li>
      <li>I do recommend this original version.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still made in Italy from the original manufacturer and you get 6.8oz of it for under thirty bucks.</li>
      <li>The scent did not even resemble the original fragrance.</li>
      <li>Not spicy, not citrusy, just clean.</li>
      <li>clean, and refreshing yet still masculine, my favorite for years, my wife loves it too</li>
      <li>And at the right price!</li>
      <li>Its advertised as &amp;#34;ACQUA DI SELVA For Men By VISCONTI DI MODRONE Eau De Cologne Spray&amp;#34;.. I absolutely despise splash-ons since you tend to use more..  </li>
      <li>Its very close to my Adventure perfume, though it has a bit more lemon/fruit in it.</li>
      <li>This is the finest, most pleasant and cedary-citrusy cologne ever made...and one of the few that I am not allergic to.</li>
      <li>Fresh, clean.</li>
      <li>It just has the most romantic, captivating scent.</li>
      <li>Fell in love with this (and HIM :)) and still do, just as much,all these years later.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Acqua de Selva for many years and there is always a clean, crisp fragrance that makes you feel fresh and ready to go.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s statements from other reviewers saying that Acqua Di Selva isn&#x27;t as good as when it was originally by Victor.</li>
      <li>I find the smell basically the same and refreshing scent with a pine like edge!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Update 11-20-15. Been using this product since 1968  however in recent years noticed  that the fragrance was not  as strong as when  formulated by the original company Victor. The new product lacks sustainability when applied to your skin. Fragrance is gone in minutes. I do apply it to clothing for a lasting effect. I did prove my theory by buying some new old stock by Victor and comparing. The original is longer lasting. Maybe the new company can reformulate and charge a little more. I will pay. unbelievably quick shipping great product thank you.</li>
    <li> After years of search for an alternative to the Adidas Adventure fragrance I knew from Germany, I finally found this perfume and love it! Its very close to my Adventure perfume, though it has a bit more lemon/fruit in it. People may say that you smell like sunscreen but I love it. Its refreshing and I love the faint fragrance of lavender that cheers me up in the morning. Until Adidas will decide to resurrect the gold old Adventure, I might stay with this &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; perfume.</li>
    <li> I have explored a lot of popular colognes for men, including some very high end colognes, and I always go back to this one for my gifts to my boyfriend (which are really gifts to myself). This used to be a very expensive cologne in it heyday, and now you can get this wonderful cologne very inexpensively. I like the cologne better than the aftershave (the aftershave is more subtle). It has a complex layer of notes, each one of which becomes more and more subtle, but all of which are masculine, musky and woody. The problem I have with most colognes is that the top note is too strong and leaves a strong trail. This one is great from the beginning to the end when it fades away on my pillow. You have to get close to really notice it, so it doesn&#x27;t take over a room when a man walks through, but it leaves enough of a trail that it catches your attention if you notice scents on men.</li>
    <li> I use this cologne for the last 45 years ever since a girl told me I was smelling great! Men, start smelling great today!</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find Acqua Di Selva in stores. My barber from Sicily has a giant bottle on the counter with a mister that looks like a bug sprayer and applies it generously after a shave or haircut.    This bottle is very larger at 6.8 oz. Most department store colognes are only about a third of this size. Great scent, great value!</li>
    <li> This is cologne&#x27;s sent is very unpleasant. Almost as bad as when you walk through the miasma of perfumes at a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne taught me a lesson -- never buy a cologne without smelling it first. I was lead awry by all these positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent offends my senses.</li>
    <li> Not as I remembered it  Yawn</li>
    <li> This product was so much more than I had expected.  First of all, I did not know that it still existed, as I had gotten it for my boyfriend back in the &#x27;60&#x27;s (who is now my husband of 42+ years!) and, well - it exists!  Secondly, the size was listed but I did not relate the ounces to an actual bottle size, and was VERY surprised when it arrived and it was enormous! The price was excellent, and it arrived very quickly. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who has been using Acqua Di Selva spray cologne since the late 50&#x27;s!  It&#x27;s not easy to find in stores and when you can, it&#x27;s overpriced.  This is a great value and he loved that it lasts much longer than the spray--who said you can&#x27;t teach an old dog new tricks!</li>
    <li> This is a clean, fresh, &amp; manly Italian sent. I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this cologne.</li>
    <li> I think they changed the formula. By the time I finish my breakfast, the scent is gone</li>
    <li> This was my father&#x27;s fragrance of choice, and it was added to my arsenal in high school in the early 90&#x27;s. I came to inherit several of the mini bottles we had around the house , which were several years old at least. The cologne always got me a favorable response from women of all ages, and always made me happy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to 2013, and I&#x27;m experiencing enjoyment of all things related to the wet-shaving hobby. Have added several aftershaves and colognes to my collection - especially those of timeless appeal like Acqua di Selva. My logic was that going back to this old favorite would be that special \\&quot;icing on the cake\\&quot; to my morning shave and grooming regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on Amazon. I always look at those \\&quot;it ain&#x27;t made like the old stuff\\&quot; style reviews with a degree of skepticism.  Why would anyone mess with a winning formula? And, can people really remember these nuances that distinctly?  Undeterred, I ordered a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first opening, I realized there is truly a difference. I am not familiar with the terms scent aficionados use, but the overall impression is this is an approximation or diluted example of the original.  There was a depth to the one I remembered that would just grab and captivate the senses. This lacks that punch.  Like one of the fragrance components is lacking or in amounts too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experimented with application both dabbing to the neck and spraying on via atomizer.  After drying a bit, the classic Acqua Di Selva comes out, but it doesnt last long enough or carry. Ymmv, but I find that some of my inexpensive OTC aftershaves like Pinaud and Brut even last longer.  Always have applied fragrances sparingly, but remembered performance of the old version of this,  2 small dabs of this would last most of a warm day, and it would clearly be recognizable on your shirt collar at the end of day. No such luck with this version. Subtle is good for a day-to-day mens fragrance, but this is just too subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I suspect this is just a matter of the product having had the formula tweaked to be less potent, so it can profitably be sold by the current manufacturer at this price point.  Nothing new with that concept. It is not a distasteful cologne in any way, but in my humble opinion they just don&#x27;t make it like they used to. It will stay in my rotation, but my interest now is to acquire a vintage bottle of it to try.ust too subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I suspect this is just a matter of the product having had the formula tweaked to be less potent, so it can profitably be sold by the current manufacturer at this price point.

    <li> No other way to describe the scent except &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;. Not spicy, not citrusy, just clean. And not overpowering like some men&#x27;s colognes can be.</li>
    <li> Favorite of mine for years. Best price anywhere &amp; delivery was perfect!</li>
    <li> This is the finest, most pleasant and cedary-citrusy cologne ever made...and one of the few that I am not allergic to. I have been using it since college days; I turned 60 Friday, and it is still my favorite.  I LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;The original by Victor of Milan must have had a higher % of the essential oils of the fragrance however, because this newer version of it by Visconti Di Madrone seems watered down and does NOT last as long. I still use it, but why weaken a perfect product??</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Never overwhelming</li>
    <li> I have been looking for many years to find this again!!  I first smelled it in the mid-seventies and fell in love with it!!  It is the most intoxicating men&#x27;s scent ever!!  I&#x27;m so surprised and thrilled to finally find it again!!  Thanks to Amazon my man will have the most sensual cologne in the world!!!  Thanks so much!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this cologne about 10 years ago. Out of maybe 15 or 20 more expensive, more modern fragrances this one has grown on me the most, at least as a casual, everyday scent. I feel like I&#x27;m dressing up with all my other colognes, but with Aqua di Selva it&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve just gone out and harvested some rosemary or lavender or cooked a meal with heavy herbs. Every other cologne I&#x27;ve tried has a synthetic, unnatural, formal quality to it, including other older ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not well suited for anything other than casual use though. And it&#x27;s not a good pick if you want a strong penetrating smell. It&#x27;s like a more natural form of Obsession Night,Polo Modern Reserve, or a Barbary that I don&#x27;t remember the name of.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked this for 30 years. We&#x27;re both still good.</li>
    <li> My husband has worn various colognes but this has always been his favorite....such a clean scent.  He gets compliments on it from both men and women and some of his men friends have asked that I order bottles for them. We can&#x27;t find it in stores, but Amazon has it and with a good price.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call this a very woodsy cologne but Acqua Di Selva is highly overlooked these days.Think outdoorsy (to an extent) but more clean cut or aristocratic in it&#x27;s nature.It&#x27;s mostly a blend of lemon oil,pine,and vetiver grass all coming out in generous portions.There is moss present but just a dab of it.This never was a heavy scent so it&#x27;s not a potent projector.You can smell this lightly on yourself and someone close can smell it but that&#x27;s about it.On my skin it lasts around 4 to 6 hours but it also depends on how much you apply.Great cologne though a family member of mine got me into it many years ago.It&#x27;s not the only cologne I wear but it gets used often.I&#x27;ll give it props though Acqua Di Selva is very neutral regardless if you wear it daily at work,a date or social event,or just a special occasion.A very delightful smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay why is the VICTOR reference ridiculed in my eyes?&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s statements from other reviewers saying that Acqua Di Selva isn&#x27;t as good as when it was originally by Victor.Here&#x27;s the funny side to this explanation...there was no such fragrance manufacturer named Victor.Victor was just a fragrance brand line name created by Visconti Di Modrone.The Victor subsidiary was around for many decades but only a handful of scents were released under the Victor line.I should know I used to buy the Wall Street EDT by Victor back in the 80&#x27;s and if you look at the back or bottom of the box it says Visconti Di Modrone.I will make the statement that I wish Visconti still made Wall Street also though...hope to see that scent come back one dayDoesn&#x27;t remind me of NYSE but more of german/swiss architecture and dimly light studies surrounded by leather-bound books..But Acqua Di Selva still smells the same as I remember.It&#x27;s still made in Italy from the original manufacturer and you get 6.8oz of it for under thirty bucks.The questionable statements from other reviewers are new users either trying to sound knowledgeable with no actual experience or they&#x27;ve just never read the back of an older box.5-stars...great stuff!they&#x27;ve just never read the back of an older box.5-stars...great stuff!</li>
    <li> When I first met my husband, about 45 years ago, he had just returned from Vietnam and when we went out on our first date, he was wearing this.  Fell in love with this (and HIM :)) and still do, just as much,all these years later.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed to receive what I believe is a defective or fraudulent product that Amazon will not allow me to return or receive a refund on.  I&#x27;m very familiar with this cologne, as it is the only cologne I&#x27;ve ever used and I still have a partial bottle that has the correct fragrance and smells completely different than  the product that I was sent.</li>
    <li> Acqua Di Selva, one of my old favorites was a huge disappointment. The scent did not even resemble the original fragrance. I am not sure what the reason for the difference is, perhaps the brand name was sold to a discount perfumer.</li>
    <li> My husband loved and wore this once when he was in the Marine Corps. An army friend of his, had it shipped to him from Philadelphia, and let my husband try it, while they were stationed in South Korea. He only wore it the one time, around 23-24 years ago, and he had been looking for it, with no luck, ever since then. This is a great deal on a great product. 6.8oz is A LOT of cologne for a good price- and it is lasting well. Unlike body spritzes, you only need a little - and it goes a long way. I now understand why he loved it- I do too. I love when he wears it and hugs our nearly three year old son, who then smells like it too. It&#x27;s cute. It arrived packaged well and came within the expected time frame. I believe if it is still available when he runs out- he&#x27;ll definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> My  husband has use this product for years.  It is priced better on Amazon than other fragrance online ratailers; it is also very difficult to fine in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I have frequently bought this product from this company and and have been completely satisfied everytime.</li>
    <li> First purchased in England in the 70/s for my friend.  Hard to locate but everyone i have given it to fell in love with the product.</li>
    <li> We remember this fragrance from way back in the early 1970&#x27;s. Nice fresh clean scent. Almost smells like you just getting out of a fresh clean shower!</li>
    <li> This is what real men smell like.&lt;br /&gt;It takes me back to the 1960&#x27;s when men were men.</li>
    <li> Used this in College in the last century  It was made by Victor o of Milano. Figured I would try this and it  smells the same. The aroma is refreshing, fresh and zesty, just  like the old days.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this for years, hard to find but amazon makes it easy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Acqua Di Selva for over 20 years, and it&#x27;s my all time favorite.  It was delivered on time and the price was great.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who is from northern Italy.  His father used this and he used it on and off.  When he moved to the US a few years ago he had a hard time finding it in the department store or any store in general.  I bought it on amazon and it was delivered timely.  According to him, the scent is just like the one he purchased in Italy and it&#x27;s much cheaper from Amazon.</li>
    <li> A blast from the past! This smell takes me back to the sixties! I find the smell basically the same and refreshing scent with a pine like edge!</li>
    <li> Not the original by Victor but smells sweeter almost the same but I could be wrong they must have went out of business cause I got a hole bunch at Odd Jobs on 32 st in NYC 15 years ago and still had some left to compare them.</li>
    <li> Good delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> This smelled like bad alcohol. Not at all the real deal! Rip off</li>
    <li> Finally found a source for my all time favorite cologne...thanks</li>
    <li> This bottle has lost its potency&lt;br /&gt;The smell hardly detectable within few minutes of application&lt;br /&gt;It is waste of my money&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return it and get refunded</li>
    <li> For 30 years this has been my favorite cologne for men. I can remember buying it at Bigsby and Kruthers in Chicago in the 1980s. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon sells it. It just has the most romantic, captivating scent. Very Italian, urbane, sophisticated. If you like the vetiver oil, you will love this cologne.</li>
    <li> Be warned, this is a splash on,, not a spray.. Its advertised as &amp;#34;ACQUA DI SELVA For Men By VISCONTI DI MODRONE Eau De Cologne Spray&amp;#34;.. I absolutely despise splash-ons since you tend to use more..  Other than that, I like the smell.. Its mellow.. I have used this Acqua Di Selva earlier and I can vouch that its definitely not how it used to be.</li>
    <li> Worth buying and seems to be the real deal...</li>
    <li> After Aqua Di Selva (By Victor) being my &amp;#34;trade mark&amp;#34; cologne since 1963 I was highly disappointed with the new Modrone label version, the original  blend by Victor would last and last, this watered down perfumed inside the bottle will be imperceptible after you splash it on, seems they are saving on &amp;#34;fixer&amp;#34;, total waste of money, will go for either &amp;#34;Pino Silvestre&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Agua Brava&amp;#34; next time.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled they still make this.  I am allergic to many fragrances but not this one.  I have used this since I was 20 years old and I&#x27;m now 70!! It is very light and everyone seems to love the smell.  It never overpowers.  Over the years it never fails to bring back so many wonderful memories.  I always have two bottles in linen closet.</li>
    <li> Aqua Di Silva is just a good old favorite and I&#x27;m glad it is still available in the United States.</li>
    <li> just like I remembered it from years ago. Fresh, clean. The right thing to put on after a shower just lounging around</li>
    <li> clean, and refreshing yet still masculine, my favorite for years, my wife loves it too, I wish more of the line was available like soap deodorant, shave balm etc.</li>
    <li> Great fresh clean sent!</li>
    <li> You know how they say that first impressions are lasting...well, they are, but not this time.  I just gave this a second chance after not touching it after the only time a used a 2 years ago, and I like it now.  Big citrus/sweet basil opening and drys down quickly to a grassy-green scent that is very pleasant before it quickly disappears.  Not for everyday, but I do like it suddenly.</li>
    <li> My father (RIP) used to use Acqua Di Selva when I was young and I used to love the smell of it. when I found it online, I rushed to buy it, although some mentioned that it does not smell like the original. I concur, it does not smell the same. Maybe this is a newer version of it or I don&#x27;t know, but it is not the same, very close but not the same. With that said, I like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> This aint no Hip hop cologne, gentlemen only. Love it from back in the day. Will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years....fresh smell...vigorating</li>
    <li> Acqua Di Selva is my husband&#x27;s all-time favorite men&#x27;s fragrance. We haven&#x27;t seen it in stores for a long time, so we&#x27;re glad to know that it&#x27;s avaiilable from on-line retailers.</li>
    <li> This product is not as I expected. Seems more like &#x27;after-shave&#x27; than cologne. I&#x27;ve used it previously and the &#x27;cologne was more long lasting and much stronger smelling. wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I first wore it in the 70&#x27;s when my sister brought it back from Italy. Still has the great smell I remember - so glad they have brought this cologne back.</li>
    <li> I use one bottle (among others) almost every 6 months. I do recommend this original version. very reasonably priced from Amazon.</li>
    <li> While in college during the 70s, I worked in menswear at a local department store, where we sold Acqua Di Selva by Victor. I sampled and regularly purchased this wonderful product. However, my recent purchase suggests that this cologne; under the Visconti Di Modrone label; is not as long lasting as its Victor predecessor. The fragrance captures the earlier formula, but the scent is not very long lasting. I actually like this lighter formula. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as many folks don&#x27;t like to be around long-lasting strong scents. However, this might be a buying considerat</li>
    <li> My husband has been using aqua di selva since the 60&#x27;s and he still gets compliments on the odor. It is very pleasant and sexy.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  A great Christmas gift.  So glad it&#x27;s still available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product more than 40 years ago.  I have not seen it in many years and decided to try it again.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and at the right price</li>
    <li> I love the scent and so does my significant other.  Lasts for hours, not over powering, citrus based.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. Discreet, as every men&#x27;s lotion should be.</li>
    <li> This fragrance was first brought to market in 1949.  My dad, a young WWII veteran then, received it as a gift when it was new.  He liked it so much that he adopted it as his signature scent.  In fact, although he wore cologne only on social occasions, never for work, this was the only one he ever wore for the rest of his life.  We could always buy it for him for Father&#x27;s Day, because a bottle would always last him a year.  When I found out several years ago that it was still in production, my olfactory memory told me I had liked it when he was still living, and I decided to try it.  Although it is only one of a half dozen fragrances in my rotation at any given time, it is definitely a favorite.  The fact that it has been around so long, and little is being spent on marketing, makes it an excellent value.  It is much less expensive than the more trendy fragrances and every bit as appealing.</li>
    <li> Amazing !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Acqua de Selva for many years and there is always a clean, crisp fragrance that makes you feel fresh and ready to go.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent everyday cologne with a wonderful scent: parts pine, lime, and powder with an undercurrent of herbs to my nose.  The scent is very clean, and if scents can be described in terms of color, I&#x27;d call this one green.  While the smell isn&#x27;t all that long-lasting, it fades to something pleasant and warm while not retaining anything overpowering or out of balance.  This is good if you&#x27;re one of those guys who habitually applies too much aftershave or cologne.  I&#x27;ve receive nice comments from women when I wear Acqua Di Selva too.  If I&#x27;m going to wear one EDC when I go anywhere, this is it.</li>
    <li> Love it, been using it for 50 years.</li>
    <li> Same old Aqua Di Selva. I love it. Fresh impact !!</li>
    <li> I purchase this cologne for my father every year for his birthday and he just absolutely loves it. I also enjoy the smell when he wears it! Great buy!</li>
    <li> My husband wore this fragrance when we were dating - one of the many things I loved about him!  Now he can wear it again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I first became aware of this fragrance when I worked at its ad agency in the 80s.  From the simple, classic packaging to the crisp, clean, masculine scent it is a thorough classic for a gentleman of taste and sophistication.  It occurred to me the other day that Don Draper of MAD MEN would definitely wear this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the young men today:  Retro is in, especially in fragrance.  You can&#x27;t miss with this classy blend of citrus, wood, and a ghost of spice.  And at the right price!</li>
    <li> Lemon citrus with other wood notes. Unique indeed, and the price is now right for a classic Italian cologne. This light cologne is hit or miss in terms of wow factor. I absolutely love it. Current formulation smells same as vintage 70&#x27;s/80&#x27;s variety. But it fades too rapidly.</li>
    <li> Give this one a try.  It makes a nice aftershave and has a light fresh scent. Eau de Cologne is a classic, look it up.</li>
