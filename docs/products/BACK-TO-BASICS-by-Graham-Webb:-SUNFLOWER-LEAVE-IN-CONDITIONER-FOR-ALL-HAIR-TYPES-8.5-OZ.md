<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really don&#x27;t want to give this a good review because it has been taken off the market and I don&#x27;t want the prices and availability to not be there for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I wish this product Graham Webb would go back to basics on the market. I have scalp and allergy problems and for me this is it.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  It came recommended for keeping my dog&#x27;s fur in good shape.  It takes out the tangles, smells good and leaves him soft and fluffy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I have used before. I was thrilled to be able to order it through Amazon as it is unavailable in my area. It was packaged extremely well and sent to me super fast!</li>
    <li> I have spent more money on salon products but nothing is as good as this. Good price, quick delivery, GREAT product.</li>
    <li> I bought this leave-in detangler because it was rated so high on here. However, it doesn&#x27;t work very well on long hair.</li>
    <li> I originally discoverd this product almost a decade ago and fell in love with it immediately. It spoils my hair. It is perfect for using pre-beach or pre-swim to add extra conditioning protection. I also like to use it to add a little more softness to my hair post-shower. The wonderful scent alone makes you want to apply it often.</li>
    <li> African Americans with natural hair will love this conditioner.  I have very tight, kinky hair and the comb glides through my hair like butter after spraying this product.  It&#x27;s very hard to find so I hope it&#x27;s not discontinued.    Kim</li>
    <li> It has taken me 8 years to find a detangler/leave-in conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s hair that works and does not leave her crying from knots and tangles. I love this product, I bought 3 bottles and keep one at her grandmother&#x27;s house too. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years - was upset when I heard the retailer wouldn&#x27;t be carrying it anymore as it was discontinued.  Happy to find this retail source.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is fantastic! It not only &#x27;erases&#x27; the tangles from your hair, but eliminates the static fly away problem. I even gave this to my granddaughter to help with brushing her hair after she washes it and she loves it, too!     A definite must have for your hair care needs!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for well over 10 years.  From time to time it disappears off the market only to come back in new packaging.  This is an annoyance to not have the product for a while and then hard to find it in the new packaging when available.  But, it is fantastic stuff and worth the annoyance.  This latest bottle was extremely hard to hold and spray.  You would think they would test the bottles before launching in the market place.  I take this to my salon and my hair dresser has  problems using the bottle as well - so it&#x27;s not just me.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner makes my hair so soft and shiny! It also helps with high humidity!   I love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so Upset they discontinued this product. so when i went on line an found it I was so excited! This is the best leave-in conditioner ever in existence!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It detangles and makes styling effortless. You cannot use to much...your hair never feels heavy or looks greasy. It is amazing on thin and thick hair. I cannot do without it!</li>
    <li> Bought this product in a Publix in FL several years ago, right after I had my hair colored and read that I should use a leave-in conditioner in the pool or ocean.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else since but on Amazon and it was almost 3 times what I paid for it in the store.  It does last a long time, but for the money I can get &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; in a drugstore or grocery here, with smoother results.</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner ever made!!! I have really curly hair. Other products either weigh it down or frizz it out! Sunflower defines the curls and remains soft!!!</li>
    <li> I like the back to basic leave in hair condioniter. I have been using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Will keep useing it as long as i can get it. I guess i&#x27;m going to order more as i can find it now. Thanks</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years...was apparently discontinued for awhile and has now returned.  It works wonder for my very fine,thin hair.  Not too heavy and does not weigh hair down at all!</li>
    <li> This item was not the detangler I was looking for. It was just a conditioner that left hair hravy!! The back to basic sunflower detangler was an amazing product. This is NOT for me!!</li>
    <li> I love this leave in conditioner. I have been using it on and off for over ten years since it has been hard to find at times and I&#x27;ve tried other products. I recently got re-hooked after using a John Frieda product. Their highlight activating shampoo and conditioner for lighter blondes has sunflower and white tea in it and reminded me so much of this product that I just had to go and find more. So happy that Amazon carries it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and not happy it is no longer being made.  I grab it when I can and will be sad when I can no longer buy it.  Great for my hair and does not weigh it down.</li>
