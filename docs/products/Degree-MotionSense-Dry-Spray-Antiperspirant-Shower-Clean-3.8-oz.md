      <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with how it&#x27;s working!</li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>I purchased this after all the great commercials I kept seeing on it and have been a user of Degree antiperspirant for years.  </li>
      <li>Lol</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and it lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but they just don&#x27;t keep me smelling good after a workout.</li>
      <li>I find that the deodorant I used to use Mitchum for Women does just as good of a job than using this stuff.</li>
      <li>I would have given this product one star just based on that but felt it wasn&#x27;t fair considering it does work</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful and clean</li>
      <li>I never can remember to keep the caps handy for things like hair spray and deodorant spray so loved this</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>Which is awesome as this deodorant really works to control sweat and odor for 24 hours as it promises.  </li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t think of any to be honest.</li>
      <li>Nice try.</li>
      <li>It will make you cough and is very strong.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and refreshing</li>
      <li>The shower clean has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>But, the best part is that after 3 uses so far, NO RASH.  </li>
      <li>Also, after you spray it, you feel as though you&#x27;re choking because the gases are so strong!</li>
      <li>It is overwhelming when sprayed and made me choke and have to leave the bathroom.</li>
      <li>I Like This Better Than Wipe-</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>The tube does do better job.</li>
      <li>It works well as an antiperspirant but the application is challenging.  </li>
      <li>Whatever they use as the propellant is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>If you do try this make sure you use in a well ventilated area.</li>
      <li>I hope you come up with a better formula of this.  </li>
      <li>I bought this when my Dove spray ran out, because I thought the Degree would work even better.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>6 inches away from body, choke on the fumes, cough, cough some more and done, time to get dressed.</li>
      <li>It smells better, doesn&#x27;t feel slimy after application...</li>
      <li>In terms of protecting myself against body odor, it does an OKAY job.</li>
      <li>Would be better used as an air freshener</li>
      <li>I think the Dove (which is cheaper anyway) works better than this one.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know what more you could want from a deodorant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a healthy woman and don&#x27;t have any lung problems.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure about whether or not I wanted to give this three stars or what.</li>
      <li>It really does release the great smell fragrance after perspiration happens..</li>
      <li>So tried spring a bit more at the cost of coughing a lot</li>
      <li>This deodorant really works and it smells very nice.</li>
      <li>first test was actually a really good one.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a pretty good product</li>
      <li>Clean smell...lasts all day!</li>
      <li>overwhelming odor very strong to much perfume</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, its a fine product.</li>
      <li>So that morning I spray on the deodorant and leave for the airport at a bright and early 4:30am.</li>
      <li>The smell is not overpowering and it does a great job and last all day.</li>
      <li>Those great scents mixed with sweat still smell horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s a spray, the smell seems to linger better and protect better against odors but get ready to hold your breath while you spray it on.</li>
      <li>Yes it goes on easily and dries quick.</li>
      <li>And I work in a hot kitchen all day and perspire most of that time.  </li>
      <li>I think it works even better than the traditional kind.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m SUPER excited about this stuff</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m SUPER excited about this stuff</li>
      <li>The ONLY THING I like better about the Degree is the fact you can slide a button on the top and lock the lid in place.</li>
      <li>Just a quick spritz under each armpit.</li>
      <li>Still smelled exactly as it did when I applied it!</li>
      <li>and I can say, that somehow, this deodorant keeps me stink free for 48 whole hours.</li>

      <li>I like the scent OK but would like to try other options as I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>of the product descriptions are definitely right.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do a good job at keeping me dry or keeping me smelling fresh all day.  </li>
      <li>This is an effective product, that will keep you dry and fresh.</li>
      <li>The shower clean scent smells really good, however I don&#x27;t think the spray gives you the same protection as the solid.</li>
      <li>It does go on clean and there is no residue on your clothes; even my nice black work dress.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin and cannot use deodorants containing aluminum chloride which is the main ingredient in most of these deodorants.</li>
      <li>When I spent time in England, I noticed they had effective antiperspirant spray deodorant.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m paranoid but I think it makes me sweat more on my back because it prevents sweat in my underarms?</li>
      <li>You cannot use this while wearing anything sleeveless, especially darker clothes, for example a shift dress or a tank top.</li>
      <li>can hug my boyfriend without worrying he&#x27;ll smell my armpits, even in the morning when we first wake up.</li>

      <li>I really like this product, doesn&#x27;t leave you wet feeling and more importantly, the convince.</li>
      <li>Soft and smooth to touch.</li>
      <li>The scent is clean &amp; fresh but is a little strong</li>
      <li>With the fact that the stick lasts long (on my arm pits and for the tube) its a better bang for your buck in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The Can itself says last up to eight weeks this may be true but for the price I don&#x27;t think that is worth it.</li>

      <li>I use it as directed and don&#x27;t use too much either.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times and each time I&#x27;ve had a coughing fit.</li>
      <li>I have to say, for $5 I am very dissatisfied with this product.  </li>
      <li>I tried applying lightly and from varying distances with similar results.</li>

      <li>Also, sorry this was kind of a novel, I&#x27;m just really excited!</li>
      <li>Not for this one, though, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try (albeit with some trepidation as I wasn&#x27;t sure how its other ingredients would treat my skin).  </li>
      <li>The main reason I&#x27;d use this is because the deodorant gunk won&#x27;t get on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If only there were a different scent that I&#x27;d like better, this might be my holy grail deodorant/antipersperant.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used spray deo for years.  I like this one.</li>
    <li> I feel like this keeps me very dry in comparison to my regular deodorant. Unfortunately it leaves very bad flaky, almost crusty, residue. It&#x27;s sort of crystalline in appearance. I tried applying lightly and from varying distances with similar results. If the product isn&#x27;t fully dry, it will transfer to your clothing. I also find that I have to apply fully unclothed to avoid getting residue on my bra or clothing. It makes a faint cloud that lingers for 15-30 seconds, so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally breath it in or get it in your mouth like hair spray. I also have long hair and it&#x27;s difficult to keep some of the aerosol cloud from landing on my ends. I imagine it leaves unnecessary residue on your floor, counters, or vanity too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to give this product a completely bad review because it&#x27;s effective as an antiperspirant and I like the smell, however the residue is unacceptable to me and I can&#x27;t stand the aerosol delivery. I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my money trying it, but I will probably not purchase an aerosol deodorant in the future.</li>
    <li> This really does work. I spray it on my underarms in the morning, then by the end of a 90 degree day, I&#x27;m dry. Maybe I&#x27;m paranoid but I think it makes me sweat more on my back because it prevents sweat in my underarms? Well, dry pits were my goal, and this helped achieve that.</li>
    <li> Very good protection.</li>
    <li> If you do try this make sure you use in a well ventilated area. It will make you cough and is very strong. After a couple of hours this does wear off. I started to sweat and it felt like I was wearing nothing. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant a lot. But not much bang for your buck. The Can itself says last up to eight weeks this may be true but for the price I don&#x27;t think that is worth it. It does dry quick and seems to keep me smelling nice,very simple to put on but I feel like I could buy a deodorant stick and have it last twice as long. I would recommend and would buy again but I think for The majority of the time I will stick old school.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but the price was twice what I can buy in the store.</li>
    <li> Soft and smooth to touch. Clean smell...lasts all day! Awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> I was unhappy with this product.  It has an overpowering, not very pleasant perfume odor;  I like to wear perfume, but this product would overpower any perfume I would like to wear.</li>
    <li> It was strong enough to last me a day and a half but the smell while applying it is just to strong for me to handle.  I&#x27;ll have to stick to the no spray deodorants.</li>
    <li> This has worked out perfectly for me. I have limited use of my arms so have been looking for something to use independently and not rely on another person for help. This is it! I would, however, suggest a mask since the spray does go pretty far and not good to breathe. The shower clean has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after all the great commercials I kept seeing on it and have been a user of Degree antiperspirant for years.  I have to say, for $5 I am very dissatisfied with this product.  Any time I try to use it, it tends to make me choke and gasp for air.  I use it as directed and don&#x27;t use too much either.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the scent or the fact that it&#x27;s a dry spray or what, but I&#x27;ve been very dissatisfied with this product and wish I had known how bad of a product it was before purchasing it.  Also, I&#x27;ve noticed, not only does it choke me when first putting it on, but it really doesn&#x27;t work well.  It really doesn&#x27;t do a good job at keeping me dry or keeping me smelling fresh all day.  I hope you come up with a better formula of this.  It seems like a good concept which made me want to try it, just seemed like poor execution.</li>
    <li> I finally found something that works and that gets rid of the problematic white lines on my clothing.</li>
    <li> I hope this never goes away.... I love this stuff.  When I spent time in England, I noticed they had effective antiperspirant spray deodorant. I always wished they would bring that over here to the states.  It smells better, doesn&#x27;t feel slimy after application...AND it makes me smell fresh all day. If you are prone to sweating, I highly recommend this product.  I still sweat, but I am never worried about smelling.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t clump up in my pits.. all around awesome product.</li>
    <li> Makes me sneeze.  It has a very annoying smell!</li>
    <li> so far I am really liking this spray on antiperspirant. The trick is to find an amount that works for you all day and only spray that amount on&lt;br /&gt;The first day I wore it I sprayed very little on and it didn&#x27;t last all day, the 2nd day I sprayed a little more then the day before, and it lasted my entire work day. And I work in a hot kitchen all day and perspire most of that time.  It really does release the great smell fragrance after perspiration happens.. I didn&#x27;t believe it until the second day.. and when I went to take my shower after working all day I still could smell the deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;So the key is getting to know how much you need to spray on in order for it to work all day.  I had no issues with the &amp;#34;cloud&amp;#34; that other reviewers spoke of.. I just didn&#x27;t go crazy with it and I think that is key.</li>
    <li> This product works fairly well, I would say it is comparable to your average antiperspirant as far as keeping you dry.  Frankly, some antiperspirants work really well for some folks and not at all for others; if you are having issues staying dry this is worth giving a try.  It does not leave a residue or leave your skin feeling super tacky and wet, such as after using a roll-on.  The major drawback to this product is how insanely over-fragranced it is.  I apply it right under the bathroom fan and immediately have to vacate the bathroom for at least five minutes just to be able to breathe without choking on the fragrance that has seemingly permeated every last little bit of oxygen in the room.  I would have given this product one star just based on that but felt it wasn&#x27;t fair considering it does work okay.  The overpowering fragrance, while only temporary, is enough to keep me from purchasing this product again but there are some pros to it, in that it keeps me dry in 100-degree heat and goes on clean without any residue or leftover stickiness.  If you have issues staying dry I would suggest giving this a try, just do so in a well-ventilated area!</li>
    <li> I bought this when my Dove spray ran out, because I thought the Degree would work even better. The ONLY THING I like better about the Degree is the fact you can slide a button on the top and lock the lid in place. This is critical for taking the bottle with you when traveling! I never can remember to keep the caps handy for things like hair spray and deodorant spray so loved this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps me from sweating but man my pits REEK within a few hours. I have to respray. I think the Dove (which is cheaper anyway) works better than this one. I&#x27;ll be purchasing the Dove for myself when this runs out. My man uses the Dove for Men spray deodorant and loves it.</li>
    <li> So unfortunately stick deodorant took me on a turn for the worse. Unfortunately I began to break out horri</li>
    <li> I read reviews about this before buying the product so I thought I would write my opinion on it after I used it. It is NOT worth it. As others have pointed out it does choke you. I tried spring a little but I get sweaty and wet after walking 10 mins to work in 80 degree weather. So tried spring a bit more at the cost of coughing a lot and I started getting white residue. Spraying a lot lasts longer but 7 to 8 hrs probably. The tube does do better job. Can&#x27;t wait till the spray can is over.</li>
    <li> This actually did last for 2 days! I was even athletic on the second day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. You can&#x27;t breath while you spray it and doesn&#x27;t last at all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> overwhelming odor very strong to much perfume</li>
    <li> Well, it definitely works! It goes on nice and dry, doesn&#x27;t leave any white spots anywhere; even on black clothes. It smells nice and refreshing I guess, nothing to fawn over. It&#x27;s a deodorant that does what it supposed to do; no more, no less.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this but it definitely doesn&#x27;t really live up to it&#x27; claims. I tend to sweat a lot, even when I am sitting at work and regular deodorants protect better than this one. Because it&#x27;s a spray, the smell seems to linger better and protect better against odors but get ready to hold your breath while you spray it on. It is overwhelming when sprayed and made me choke and have to leave the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Yes it goes on easily and dries quick. I&#x27;m not a fan of the spray however. The spray gets all up in my sinuses and throat and I feel like I could be getting cancer from it perhaps. It goes something like this: lift arm, spray 6 inches away from body, choke on the fumes, cough, cough some more and done, time to get dressed. It doesn&#x27;t work that well either, my pits feel gross as we speak and I sit at a desk all day.  Time to go back to what  I was using which was still Degree but in a normal stick. Nice try.</li>
    <li> Whatever they use as the propellant is overwhelming. I&#x27;m not over using it. Just a quick spritz under each armpit. I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times and each time I&#x27;ve had a coughing fit. I&#x27;m a healthy woman and don&#x27;t have any lung problems. Recommend using it in a well ventilated area. I would not recommend it for anyone with respiratory issues.</li>
    <li> This is an effective product, that will keep you dry and fresh. The reason I gave it three stars is, that it does leave white residue on your clothes. You cannot use this while wearing anything sleeveless, especially darker clothes, for example a shift dress or a tank top. The white residue will be visible right under your arm. I tried only applying a little product, but after getting dressed is still transfers onto the fabric. A second issue is, that when you spray it a big cloud comes out and you have to hold your breath, so you don&#x27;t inhale. I&#x27;d recommend it for anybody who wears sleeves, because the product does work very well. I for one just cannot deal with the residue.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it claims.  But I had to throw my bottle away because the spray makes me choke, messes with my sinuses, and gives me a major headache.</li>
    <li> Remember the 70s or 80s?  Remember your older brother fogging up the bathroom to where it had to air our for half an hour before you could even BREATHE in there?  OMG!  This is ridiculous!  If you&#x27;re not going to use it outside, don&#x27;t use it!  It&#x27;s everywhere, lands on everything, you have to leave the room!</li>
    <li> The shower clean scent smells really good, however I don&#x27;t think the spray gives you the same protection as the solid. Also, after you spray it, you feel as though you&#x27;re choking because the gases are so strong! Definitely not good for the environment. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again, and wouldn&#x27;t recommend either.</li>
    <li> I normally use Degree Motion Sense stick but I thought I would try the Shower Clean Dry Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the product descriptions are definitely right. It does go on clean and there is no residue on your clothes; even my nice black work dress. The smell is pleasant and it lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this during days that were highs in low 90&#x27;s and lows in high 60&#x27;s with humidity that hovered between 70-90%. I am working an office job 9-5, but I am fairly active. My pedometer logs about 8 miles a day and I go to the gym 5 days out of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not enjoy putting it on in a closed space like a bathroom. You definitely breathe in the fumes which is fairly unpleasant. By about 6pm, I start to notice that the feeling it faded; I am still protected from smell, but my armpit begins to feel more sticky which is so unpleasant in this humidity. I ran a 5k with this deodorant and applied some before hand, it lasted through the run just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a fine product. With the fact that the stick lasts long (on my arm pits and for the tube) its a better bang for your buck in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, doesn&#x27;t leave you wet feeling and more importantly, the convince. Save yourself from going out and making impulse buys.Lol</li>
    <li> Love it, it keeps my underarms dry the whole day.</li>
    <li> This deodorant really works and it smells very nice. The dry aspect of the product leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh. I was prepared to be disappointed, but instead I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> To start off with, I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything in my life; but I wanted to write one for this spray because it has improved my confidence leaps and bounds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 25 year old woman and I&#x27;ve dealt with sweat and stink my whole life. In highschool it was obtrusive amounts of sweat with no stink, in the last 6 or so years it has been very little sweat but OH MAN THE STINK. No matter how much I washed or scrubbed, I would stink within 30 minutes of getting out of the shower, even without doing physical activity. I don&#x27;t know what happened to my body, but something changed and I&#x27;ve tried every deodorant under the sun to make the stink go away; this included extra strength, clinical strength, natural deodorants, crystal sticks, powders, and a million other things. I could of paid off half my student loans with the money I&#x27;ve spent on deodorants in the last few years. I did a lot of research and just chalked it up to genetics and that I would have to live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve been praying for spray deodorant to become popular in America because I hate using stick deodorant (you&#x27;re just reapplying bacteria to your armpits!) so when I found the dry spray I snatched it up. I didn&#x27;t really have any hope that it would actually work, since nothing has to date, but I wanted to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first test was actually a really good one. I was flying to DC for my birthday to stay with some friends for a few days, and for a lot of us, airports can make you super nervous and rushed (which in turn makes you a sweaty mess hot mess...at least for me..) So that morning I spray on the deodorant and leave for the airport at a bright and early 4:30am. I make it to DC and to my friends house and then we proceed to go out on the town until around 9pm that night. After we get home and get into our PJs I realized as I took of my shirt that...MY ARMPITS DIDN&#x27;T STINK! After ALL OF THAT! I think I almost cried. I could, for the first time in my life, wear the same shirt two days in a row if I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can hug my boyfriend without worrying he&#x27;ll smell my armpits, even in the morning when we first wake up. I CAN DO OVER SHOULDER HUGS! I can wear sweaters and jackets and layers and not have to worry about sweating and stinking through them. I can reach for things in crowded public places. I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying deodorant 3-4+ times a day or have to wash my armpits 2-3 times a day. I don&#x27;t have to wash my jackets every 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a shower every other day and I can say, that somehow, this deodorant keeps me stink free for 48 whole hours. It does not, however, keep my all that dry. I still sweat a little bit, but I will take sweat over stink any day of the week. And like others have said, spray this stuff in a well ventilated room because you will choke on it if you breath it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m SUPER excited about this stuff and I&#x27;m very pleased with how it&#x27;s working! It will be the only deo I buy until it does stop working for some reason. Also, sorry this was kind of a novel, I&#x27;m just really excited!e same shirt two days in a row if I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can hug my boyfriend without worrying he&#x27;ll smell my armpits, even in the morning when we first wake up.

    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure about whether or not I wanted to give this three stars or what. Actually, this is more like 3 and a HALF stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll break this down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I Like This Better Than Wipe-On Deodorant:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Main Reason) It doesn&#x27;t muck up your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really the worst thing about wipe-on, wet deodorant is that it WILL get on your clothes and have the armpits of your shirt smell like whatever deodorant you swiped on. I don&#x27;t like dry deodorant because it cakes on your skin and crumbles up, and it&#x27;s just...blech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Reasons I Like It Better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ummm, I can&#x27;t think of any to be honest. In terms of protecting myself against body odor, it does an OKAY job. I find that the deodorant I used to use Mitchum for Women does just as good of a job than using this stuff. The main reason I&#x27;d use this is because the deodorant gunk won&#x27;t get on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s a pretty good product and I might buy it again depending on how long the can I got will last me (I got it as a free sample) and how expensive it is in the store.</li>
    <li> It sprays on dry &amp; leaves no white marks on clothing, it smells fresh and keeps me dry all day. The scent is clean &amp; fresh but is a little strong so I use this when I&#x27;m working out, cleaning house etc &amp; not wearing any perfume.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered this &#x27;dry spray&#x27; that it&#x27;s JUST antipersperant... so...you get to be dry and... um...STINK like BO..  I thought it might just be &#x27;me&#x27;..so a couple of my friends used the spray I bought..um..didn&#x27;t last even 12 hours...yep..they were &#x27;kinda dry with breakthrough wetness&#x27; and &#x27;full on  body arm pit ODOR a few hours after an eight hour shift at work. YUK&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this product. It works well as an antiperspirant but the application is challenging.  Safety warnings state to keep away from face and eyes so you don&#x27;t inhale it but even turning your face the other way doesn&#x27;t help. I still am inhaling quite a bit and have to walk out of my bathroom to get away from it. It&#x27;s hard to apply it when you can&#x27;t look at where you&#x27;re spraying it and how much you&#x27;re actually applying.  I&#x27;m going back to a stick so I&#x27;m not inhaling a ton of chemicals...</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about how much protection it would offer. I have to say, I think it works even better than the traditional kind. I was always famous for not giving my traditional deodorant enough time to dry before putting my clothes on and then having marks all over them. With this spray that&#x27;s no longer a concern at all, it really is instantly dry. The smell is not overpowering and it does a great job and last all day. Don&#x27;t know what more you could want from a deodorant.</li>
    <li> Great. Goes on dry and weeks for 48 hours! Smells wonderful and clean</li>
    <li> I used degree fresh energy motion sense in stick form and got this dry spray as a sample a while back. The stick was bad for me and this isn&#x27;t much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: goes on dry enough depending on how far away you spray it--curious to see how it feels right after shaving. Has a nice scent. Packaging is not obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it definitely leaves residue as any other deodorant does. I like to spray closer to 4 inches away rather than the 6 they recommend and either way you can see it under you arms. The spray gets in the air and inhaling it chokes you up. Rubs off on your shirt so no improvements there. Those great scents mixed with sweat still smell horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed. Would be better used as an air freshener but then I would probably choke to death.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and cannot use deodorants containing aluminum chloride which is the main ingredient in most of these deodorants. Not for this one, though, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try (albeit with some trepidation as I wasn&#x27;t sure how its other ingredients would treat my skin).  It does go on dry as promised. I like the scent OK but would like to try other options as I don&#x27;t love it. I am still getting the hang of a spray deodorant and fogged my little bathroom with me and my husband coughing and desperate to leave the fumes of the deodorant after a too-vigorous application. But, the best part is that after 3 uses so far, NO RASH.  Which is awesome as this deodorant really works to control sweat and odor for 24 hours as it promises.  If only there were a different scent that I&#x27;d like better, this might be my holy grail deodorant/antipersperant.</li>
    <li> Love it! Held up through a tough workout. I didn&#x27;t have time to head home and shower before going bra shopping. Still smelled exactly as it did when I applied it! Yay. I&#x27;ve tried degree before and wasn&#x27;t a fan and the only one that seemed to work was Secret. So I moved on to natura deodorants but they just don&#x27;t keep me smelling good after a workout. I tried Dove&#x27;s spray and that smelled awful after a few hours and even worse after a workout. I highly recommend this</li>
