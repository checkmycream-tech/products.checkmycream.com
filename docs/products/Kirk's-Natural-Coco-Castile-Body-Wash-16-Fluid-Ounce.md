      <li>My skin feels clean and smells great and is so soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product; all natural, non-drying, great lather (!), delicate fragrance and a great price.  </li>
      <li>My skin is left feeling great with no film.</li>
      <li>I have to say I was surprised at how quickly I received my order and delighted that there were additional products under the Kirk&#x27;s label.  </li>
      <li>I prefer this over the original castile soap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep with the original one.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different soaps and shampoos because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It smells very fresh--not floral or fruity.</li>
      <li>Very mild body wash which doesn&#x27;t dry out ones skin.</li>
      <li>The only thing is I can&#x27;t decide which is better as a final rinse- Kirk&#x27;s Castille Soap or the Body Wash, so I use both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this as well as the Kirk&#x27;s bar soap and hand soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super rich and thick...</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t Ned allot to do the job as a small dab of it into a wash cloth more than suffices.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural body wash give this a try.</li>
      <li>and no mess.</li>
      <li>It is hard to get excited about soap, but I like it.</li>

    <li> Wonderful fluffy lather that cleans well with a delicious scent that lingers on your towel.</li>
    <li> was a little disappointed in this product. I use the Kirks castile bar soap and like it a lot but while the body wash lathered up well it left my skin dry. won&#x27;t be buying it again. will stick to the bar soap</li>
    <li> I have the bar soap and wanted to try the body wash, although have not used it yet; but looking forward to using and if it is anything like the bar of soap I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> We tried another brand of castile body wash and did not like it but then found this product and love it!  Will definitely order this again plus its made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Very mild body wash which doesn&#x27;t dry out ones skin. Don&#x27;t Ned allot to do the job as a small dab of it into a wash cloth more than suffices.</li>
    <li> The soap has worked wonders for my husband who has/had chicken skin rashes.</li>
    <li> GREAT for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;good product!</li>
    <li> This stuff goes fast in our house, absolutely the best body wash made.  Leaves a nice fragrant sheen to the body.  The only thing is I can&#x27;t decide which is better as a final rinse- Kirk&#x27;s Castille Soap or the Body Wash, so I use both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars, another great Kirk product.</li>
    <li> It is full of fragrance</li>
    <li> I like this better than the bar soap which was very irritating and drying toy skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different soaps and shampoos because I have very sensitive skin. This is by far the best I have found. I highly recommend this as well as the Kirk&#x27;s bar soap and hand soap.</li>
    <li> Very good body wash, leaves skin soft.  Nothing harmful in it.</li>
    <li> We had been using a very expensive soap that had to be ordered along with a bunch of other stuff to get a reasonable price. Hard water has been a problem. I lucked into this soap, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it. It is foamy in all kinds of water, and it does indeed rinse thoroughly. As a bonus, I have been using it as a shampoo, and I got rid of a dandruff problem I had been fighting for years.  Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I  have ordered this body wash many times now and I absolutely love it. It smells great, you get a ton of lather with just a small amount, and it lasts forever. My skin feels clean and smells great and is so soft. I LOVE this stuff! I can use this entire 16 ounce bottle over a 2 month period. That is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY recommend!</li>
    <li> I truly love this soap. At first the smell was a little hard to get used to (I purchased the scented version....ocean breeze something or other) but it grew on me after a while. The soap was quite creamy and had a great lather!! A little goes a long way. I prefer this over the original castile soap. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural body wash give this a try.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Used on 58 day Alaska RV caravan with wash cloth to be sure no soap film remained.  A great BO preventing soap, turns hard water softer!</li>
    <li> I have used the Coco Castile Body Wash for several years now ... love it.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap, lathers up exceptionally well, will order again. My husband&#x27;s mother always used Castile soap when he was a little boy, and he loves the body wash as well.</li>
    <li> Good lather, but my husband says it&#x27;s not the kind of smell that brings out the caveman in him....Guess I&#x27;ll keep some in stock then 😆lol</li>
    <li> Even though this is natural it&#x27;s a little harsh for my skin</li>
    <li> Great for my extremely delicate skin!!!! Lathers great, no fragrance (great!) and no mess. I have to alternate soaps depending on the season/weather and Kirks is the one I use the most.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s super rich and thick...a little goes a long way. It has soft cushy bubbles (more what I would call a froth, not a lather) and smells the perfect level of soap &amp; water fresh. Not too fragrant. But just refreshing. Not drying on the skin at all. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Darn good soap.  Leaves my body and hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I have many body  wash, this was the best! I love the lather and it doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>
    <li> I use this body wash everyday.It smells great and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh. The body wash lathers with only a small amount of soap.</li>
    <li> Has a fragrance to it. The original liquid soap does not. Same size, cheaper price. I&#x27;ll keep with the original one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on Kirk&#x27;s Castile bar soap since my mother introduced me to it almost 30 years ago. Imagine my surprise when I learned there is a body wash! I eagerly anticipated receiving this purchase and I was not disappointed. The body wash is fragrant, but not overpowering..... It smells very fresh--not floral or fruity. My skin is left feeling great with no film. If Kirk&#x27;s would reduce the price, I&#x27;d probably buy more often! Like it a lot!</li>
    <li> I recently found the Kirk&#x27;s Coco Castile bar soap at my local pharmacy.  When I went back to buy more I was told that they no longer carried it so I went online.  I found it at a great price through OxKom on Amazon.com.  I have to say I was surprised at how quickly I received my order and delighted that there were additional products under the Kirk&#x27;s label.  In addition to the bar soap I decided to try the Coco Castile Body Wash.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product; all natural, non-drying, great lather (!), delicate fragrance and a great price.  I will definitely buy again from OxKom / Amazon Marketplace.</li>
    <li> Not only is it a natural product, but it feels wonderful on my skin and has a light scent of cleanliness, I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> gift for my husband Kirk, he liked it</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Clean feel, clean body.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> Smells good, cleans good, and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue!  Just what I was aiming for.</li>
