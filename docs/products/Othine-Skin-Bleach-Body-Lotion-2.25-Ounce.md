### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT, IT DOES</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>I rather just wear a good amount at night when the skin will take it in the best.  </li>
      <li>This product is great</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>This is great stuff to use before a superficial peel.  </li>
      <li>I’m so happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>I can’t put into words how happy I am with this product.  </li>
      <li>Its very effective, but shouldn&#x27;t be used for a prolonged period, once lightening is achieved, yo should maintain your complexion with SPF 15 and a milder skin product.</li>
      <li>so every morning for 5 days a week I put it on for an hour it is getting lighter but more instructions would be awesome</li>
      <li>It can get your skin really bright, but once you stop taking it or don&#x27;t protect your skin, it seems your skin color actaully is darker than what is was before you used it.</li>
      <li>but it’s good to know that I have a remedy</li>
      <li>Then put a nice amount of this stuff on before bed.  </li>
      <li>Magic in a jar this stuff is great and it work quick.</li>
      <li>Love love love this product.</li>
      <li>It was okay...</li>
      <li>I love this stuff all hyperpigmentation fading away.  </li>
      <li>and it worked great and fast</li>
      <li>most products like this don&#x27;t work</li>
      <li>I was soo glad that I did.</li>
      <li>Too oily but the works fine.</li>
      <li>So far so good...</li>
      <li>Great for men who have that dark around the beard area skin from shaving!  </li>
      <li>Great cream must use everyday to see results but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>About a week before, wash face with warm water and pat dry.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first</li>
      <li>I bought this because it has such high reviews and recommendations in many places online, but I am NOT impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly unusual because I have super sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for 2 weeks straight</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It absorbs well, and I like how the cream is white going on, but then disappears when absorbed.  </li>
      <li>It lightened my dark spot but only in patchy speckled kind of pattern.</li>
      <li>Not the quick results that I expected to get with this product.</li>
      <li>Just for your reference of this review, I am a 35 year old Caucasian woman.</li>
      <li>but I used it for complete year on my skin.</li>
      <li>My marks are almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so product in hand, I began trying to regain my lovely pale complexion back.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for the last 3 month and it has worked fine with time on eliminating my dark marks.</li>
      <li>even got rid of a burn scar on my thigh is barely visable.  </li>

<li> My marks are almost completely gone.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so product in hand, I began trying to regain my lovely pale complexion back.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for the last 3 month and it has worked fine with time on eliminating my dark marks.</li>
<li> even got rid of a burn scar on my thigh is barely visable.  </li>
<li> but the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t tell you how long to leave it on your skin for</li>
<li> It might work for a tiny spot but don&#x27;t use it if you have a larger dark patch.</li>
<li> /&gt;First off, the reason I need it is because I am very white however over the last couple years my face is turned dark and orangish.</li>
<li> I will not be using this long term</li>
<li> I had tons of dark on my face, even a spot that was a big clump of them together</li>
<li> It speeds fading up to a point and after 3 weeks of using it religiously i still had dark spots.  </li>
<li> It still left dark spots and now because of it being all speckly</li>
<li> My neck was extremely dark because of medical conditions, but it is already getting lighter.  </li>
<li> I had some dark patches on my face a used several products over the counter nothing I used work until I found this stuff</li>
<li> The only downside is that it has Hydroquinone.y lightened up my dark spots and not the rest of my face, which would have left me with an uneven complexion.  </li>
<li> This lotion don&#x27;t seem to work as U expected but if U had patient maybe U would know it works</li>
<li> Keep in a dark dry place, because the cream will turn colors.</li>
<li> It cleared up my blemishes and did not lighten any other areas of my face, which would have left me with uneven skin tone.</li>
<li> so I do an hour I have dark skin around my mouth like a freaking mustache</li>
<li> I have used this product for year and a half.</li>
<li> , my face is still dark and orangish, but i no longer smell onions!  </li>
<li> Now I have just a few spots of discoloration on my skin</li>
<li> I use it everyday the results aren&#x27;t rapid or drastic just yet.</li>
<li> i,ve been using this for like a month and see some diferences but its no magical</li>
<li> I was left with some ugly dark spots on my face.</li>
<li> I believe the product works slowly because of how my skin processes things I don&#x27;t believe it has anything to do with the product.</li>
<li> it looks worse than before.</li>
<li> that was the wrong color for my skin.&lt;br</li>
<li> (why I seemed to be smelling a faint onion odor all day)</li>
<li> and you have to avoid the sun like mad.  </li>
<li> I broke out badly after an allergic reaction to some makeup.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Magic in a jar this stuff is great and it work quick. I had some dark patches on my face a used several products over the counter nothing I used work until I found this stuff and it worked great and fast won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> It takes about a week to 10 days to see a visible difference. It definitely lightened my freckles. Expect some skin discomfort (itchiness/dryness). I would purchase it again.. I bought the 2.25 Oz container and I&#x27;ve only used about a quarter of it with my results..I&#x27;ve used the product for 2 weeks straight</li>
    <li> I have used this product for year and a half. I know the suggested use says stop after three months but I used it for complete year on my skin. There was no change in my skin tone or Texter, it cleared up my blemish area.I believe the product works slowly because of how my skin processes things I don&#x27;t believe it has anything to do with the product. This product is great and I would recommend it to anybody who has age spots Sundamage or any body blemish you need to et rid of. Just for your reference of this review, I am a 35 year old Caucasian woman.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff all hyperpigmentation fading away.  even got rid of a burn scar on my thigh is barely visable.  acne scars gone.  Miracle drug and did not lighten my skin just the marks.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it has such high reviews and recommendations in many places online, but I am NOT impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the reason I need it is because I am very white however over the last couple years my face is turned dark and orangish. Only my face, and not because of sun exposure.  It literally looks like I put on foundation (only to my jaw line) that was the wrong color for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so product in hand, I began trying to regain my lovely pale complexion back. I used it as directed but have seen NO results at all! I have used it for over a month and finally gave up.  The only thing it did was make me smell onions all day. I couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first (why I seemed to be smelling a faint onion odor all day) but then it clicked, it&#x27;s this cream!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my face is still dark and orangish, but i no longer smell onions!  Good luck!</li>
    <li> have used the product for a longd time.  It works well for me.</li>
    <li> This is also another item that I haven&#x27;t used myself, but a friend is using it , and she loves it..</li>
    <li> It was okay...did not do what I thought it would do for me...still using to give it a chance to work...</li>
    <li> Great for men who have that dark around the beard area skin from shaving!  this stuff works like a charm!!</li>
    <li> Made me break out had an issue with initial charge charged me twice wouldn&#x27;t allow refund</li>
    <li> i,ve been using this for like a month and see some diferences but its no magical it does work but maybe with 2 creams or 3 you,ll get the tone you want but it does work</li>
    <li> With this product its a win/lose situation. It can get your skin really bright, but once you stop taking it or don&#x27;t protect your skin, it seems your skin color actaully is darker than what is was before you used it. Its very effective, but shouldn&#x27;t be used for a prolonged period, once lightening is achieved, yo should maintain your complexion with SPF 15 and a milder skin product. Keep in a dark dry place, because the cream will turn colors.</li>
    <li> This crème works and works well. I broke out badly after an allergic reaction to some makeup. I was left with some ugly dark spots on my face. The Asian man at my local beauty supply store told me about this crème. I purchased it and  after 3 weeks I was soo glad that I did. My marks are almost completely gone. I&#x27;m so elated cause nothing I used worked like this. It cleared up my blemishes and did not lighten any other areas of my face, which would have left me with uneven skin tone. Also I had NO BREAK OUTS from it. Highly unusual because I have super sensitive skin.  Love love love this product. The only downside is that it has Hydroquinone.y lightened up my dark spots and not the rest of my face, which would have left me with an uneven complexion.  I am so elated. I can’t put into words how happy I am with this product.  I paid $6 at my local beauty salon.  I purchased a mirror to put on desk at work cause I cannot stop looking my face.  I’m so happy with the results.  The only thing that bothers me about this product is that it has hydroquinone. I will not be using this long term but it’s good to know that I have a remedy should I ever need it.</li>
    <li> I am and African American teenage. I had tons of dark on my face, even a spot that was a big clump of them together and it looked like one big one. I&#x27;ve been using the product for the last 3 month and it has worked fine with time on eliminating my dark marks. Now I have just a few spots of discoloration on my skin</li>
    <li> Not the quick results that I expected to get with this product. It speeds fading up to a point and after 3 weeks of using it religiously i still had dark spots.  Overall it does work just not as well as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Too oily but the works fine.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday the results aren&#x27;t rapid or drastic just yet.</li>
    <li> I had heat damage caused by metal frames from my glasses and tried all the costly products, only been using for a month and can see the dfference! I apply it twice a day</li>
    <li> I been using this product about 5 times a week but the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t tell you how long to leave it on your skin for so I do an hour I have dark skin around my mouth like a freaking mustache lol but there&#x27;s no hair there so every morning for 5 days a week I put it on for an hour it is getting lighter but more instructions would be awesome</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 6 weeks now.  My neck was extremely dark because of medical conditions, but it is already getting lighter.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great cream must use everyday to see results but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> This lotion don&#x27;t seem to work as U expected but if U had patient maybe U would know it works</li>
    <li> It lightened my dark spot but only in patchy speckled kind of pattern. It still left dark spots and now because of it being all speckly it looks worse than before. It might work for a tiny spot but don&#x27;t use it if you have a larger dark patch.</li>
    <li> So far so good...no irritations...most products like this don&#x27;t work but this one does....</li>
    <li> This is great stuff to use before a superficial peel.  About a week before, wash face with warm water and pat dry.  Then put a nice amount of this stuff on before bed.  It absorbs well, and I like how the cream is white going on, but then disappears when absorbed.  Don&#x27;t bother with putting it on during the day.  I tried this and you have to avoid the sun like mad.  I rather just wear a good amount at night when the skin will take it in the best.  Remember to exfoliate or washing and then put on moist skin.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT, IT DOES WHAT IT SAY&#x60;S IT WILL DO.</li>
