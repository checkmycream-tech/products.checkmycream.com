      <li>I bought so many because I wanted a couple for working out.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about these!</li>
      <li>Great headband for my natural hair.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>, they fit my head without sliding off.  </li>
      <li>I use these on a regular basis and they are great.</li>
      <li>Most headbands slide up my head til they come right off, not these.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight hair, so I don&#x27;t know if that is the problem.  </li>
      <li>I have to do it every time I wear it though because it goes back to it&#x27;s original size eventually-which I guess is a good thing?</li>
      <li>Great for doing a high bun on naturally course hair.</li>
      <li>SO I bought these because we think it would look good if he pulled his hair back</li>
      <li>These no-slip grip hair holders keep my thick curly hair out of my eyes perfectly and discreetly.</li>
      <li>Stays put on my head all day long, love the product, love the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality product.</li>
      <li>Very nice, since it can be dressed up or down.</li>
      <li>The no slip surface is nice and I can see how it would work great for younger girls or teens but for me they were too tight and in order to keep it on my head I had to wear it close to my hairline.</li>
      <li>They say no slip and maybe for some hair they don&#x27;t, but for me they slip right off.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re strong, last long and look good.</li>
      <li>I wear as a headband or as a large hair tie.</li>
      <li>They do slip and are a bit large.</li>
      <li>I bought these in hopes that they could keep my hair out of my face during workouts, including something as gentle as yoga.</li>
      <li>I really like these for workouts.  </li>
      <li>I really like these</li>
      <li>and we think it might be because he has so much hair.</li>
      <li>put it on and it was super squeezy and almost immediately, started sliding back from the front and up at the nape of my neck.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes, but these headbands did not deliver.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I gave this product two stars because I expected them to be comfortable and to stay in place while exercising.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a 4C natural.</li>
      <li>Slips less after hair is freshly washed.</li>
      <li>However, I convinced him to grow it out a little because when he does his already burgundy-ish hair becomes golden in some places.</li>
      <li>I have the no-slip ponytail holders and love them, but I am not happy with these.  </li>
      <li>Product is nice and tight in my thick hair.</li>
      <li>I have straight hair that&#x27;s fairly thick, so maybe my large head wasn&#x27;t a match for the no-slip?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Maybe for someone who has no trouble with slippage and just wants extra security for high-intensity workouts/sports/etc, but if you have an odd head and think these will stay on... they won&#x27;t.</li>

<li> I have been wearing these headwraps for a long time.</li>
<li> When I was reading the reviews for these headwraps, I thought to myself - naw, maybe the other reviewers writing this might just have big heads.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s less afro-like and frizzy when he goes outside.</li>
<li> Plus it&#x27;s less coarse when he lets it grow.</li>
<li> I cannot wear it all day as a headband because it feels extremely tight after several hours and gives me a headache.</li>
<li> You&#x27;d think with the bands being so tight they&#x27;d stay in place, no such luck.</li>
<li> The product is what I expected.</li>
<li> If I wear them really close to the hairline then stray hairs stick out behind the headwrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> These would not stay on my head for even five seconds before slipping up.</li>
<li> The silicone lining on the inside of the headband helps to prevent it from constantly slipping although it depends on the texture of my hair from day to day.</li>
<li> so I won&#x27;t take stars off due to my mistake</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t fall off as much as other elastic or cloth bands without the silicone on the one side.</li>
<li> I was hoping to double them up and use them in a messy updo of a tutorial I saw on YouTube, but these headwraps/headbands do NOT stay in place!</li>
<li> I have a big head, but these are exceptionally small and almost shoot off my head.</li>
<li> His hair is very thick and wavy and coarse and he always cuts it short.</li>
<li> They are too tight, and they do not really stay in place on my head.</li>
<li> They are too tight and do not really stay in place on the head.</li>
<li> I thought these would help with the way headbands seem to rise up on the back of my head and slowly slip off.</li>
<li> So, all in all, I find it a little annoying that I have to stretch them out, but I like them :)</li>
<li> it is shaped odd and fill head bands always just immediately slip backwards and off.</li>
<li> Tight, but will stretch out with use.</li>
<li> and yes, the ARE tight.</li>
<li> Just really tight.</li>
<li> They are tight but that is why they work so well.</li>
<li> They stay put and they are tight but not to tight on your head.</li>
<li> I read the reviews about them being too tight</li>
<li> Too tight.</li>
<li> They do stretch out a little bit after a while as does anything with elastic.</li>
<li> Wasted my money on these</li>
<li> They were a waste of money.</li>
<li> I have to to stretch them out over a few days before I wear them.</li>
<li> Waste of money for me.</li>
<li> I have trouble with headbands staying on my head-</li>
<li> have very thick long hair and wear a ponytail when exercising.  </li>
<li> very tight.</li>
<li> I wanted the headwrap to hold my bangs and small stray hairs away from my face to avoid sweat while in the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> They usually slide off by the time I walk to my car to drive to the gym.</li>
<li> I should have believed everyone else when they say these run small - and aren&#x27;t stretchy at all.</li>
<li> not too tight on my head, but then again my hair is very thick.</li>
<li> So disappointing, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
<li> Mine is thick</li>
<li> Holds hair up if your hair is not too thick.  </li>
<li> Not too thick.</li>
<li> Guess my head is too big :(</li>
<li> Sadly, the no-slip grip wasn&#x27;t so on these, at least for me.</li>
<li> Weird I know.</li>
<li> Wrong.</li>

    <li> Being a stay at home mom, these are perfect for when I am with the kids all day and cleaning house. Product is nice and tight in my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift and they worked out well. I like the no slip grip.</li>
    <li> Great headband for my natural hair. Stays in place</li>
    <li> These no-slip grip hair holders keep my thick curly hair out of my eyes perfectly and discreetly. They&#x27;re strong, last long and look good. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My teen daughter and I both use these head bands to keep our hair out of our eyes especially during work out and sports! it&#x27;s a good band but it would be even better if it was thicker!</li>
    <li> I really like these for workouts.  They don&#x27;t slip and they keep the hair out of my eyes.  They are tight but that is why they work so well.</li>
    <li> Tight, but will stretch out with use. Very nice, since it can be dressed up or down. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought these would help with the way headbands seem to rise up on the back of my head and slowly slip off. Its annoying and uncomfortable. Sadly, the no-slip grip wasn&#x27;t so on these, at least for me. I have straight hair that&#x27;s fairly thick, so maybe my large head wasn&#x27;t a match for the no-slip?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and it was super squeezy and almost immediately, started sliding back from the front and up at the nape of my neck. Makes no sense!!</li>
    <li> horrible i was very disappointed. when i was trying to put it in my hair it broke off. it doesn&#x27;t deserve a star at all. it doesn&#x27;t look how it seems</li>
    <li> Holds hair up if your hair is not too thick.  Mine is thick so it was only so so on holding it up.</li>
    <li> In a pinch, these head bands would work, but for every day use, they would leave me with a headache.  They are too tight, and they do not really stay in place on my head. they tend to roll and once they roll.. the sticky part is on the outside and it&#x27;s no longer no-slip.  I had high hopes, but these headbands did not deliver.</li>
    <li> I have a big head, but these are exceptionally small and almost shoot off my head.</li>
    <li> Great grip! Would recommend. 👍 planning to buy more. My daughter loves them too. Hope they have more colors. 👏</li>
    <li> These worked good on my head. Didn&#x27;t slip at all</li>
    <li> They say no slip and maybe for some hair they don&#x27;t, but for me they slip right off.  They were a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I use these on a regular basis and they are great. They stay put and they are tight but not to tight on your head. They do stretch out a little bit after a while as does anything with elastic. I would buy these again and again.</li>
    <li> I like these and they don&#x27;t slip but they give me a headache when I wear them. Too tight. But they keep your hair back. Not too thick. Just really tight. Guess my head is too big :(</li>
    <li> Maybe my head is too big? The no slip surface is nice and I can see how it would work great for younger girls or teens but for me they were too tight and in order to keep it on my head I had to wear it close to my hairline. This look is unattractive. I will never wear this out of the house and now I have to search for something different.</li>
    <li> I like the scunci no slip head wrap.  It does not get tangled in my hair and it keeps my hair together nicely.  I cannot wear it all day as a headband because it feels extremely tight after several hours and gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> These would not stay on my head for even five seconds before slipping up. The no-slip texture was not at all effective.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is supposedly American and Filipino, but we all swear that he has some African in him. His hair is very thick and wavy and coarse and he always cuts it short. However, I convinced him to grow it out a little because when he does his already burgundy-ish hair becomes golden in some places. Weird I know. Plus it&#x27;s less coarse when he lets it grow. Okay sorry, I know I&#x27;m babbling on and on. SO I bought these because we think it would look good if he pulled his hair back so it&#x27;s less afro-like and frizzy when he goes outside. I bought so many because I wanted a couple for working out. I read the reviews about them being too tight and yes, the ARE tight. They cause a crazy headache almost immediately! BUT I just stretch them across the back of a chair I have overnight and it&#x27;s fine. I have to do it every time I wear it though because it goes back to it&#x27;s original size eventually-which I guess is a good thing? They do stay on and the quality is great. They have a rubber grip and sometimes I buy headbands and after a couple uses, the grip peels off, these haven&#x27;t yet. In my boyfriend&#x27;s case, he says the bands never hurt from the beginning and we think it might be because he has so much hair. So, all in all, I find it a little annoying that I have to stretch them out, but I like them :)</li>
    <li> very tight. I have to to stretch them out over a few days before I wear them.</li>
    <li> Bands do not stay in place</li>
    <li> They do not stay in place even with the grip strip</li>
    <li> I have been wearing these headwraps for a long time. They stay in place and do a great job! I will continue to purchase and use for years to come.</li>
    <li> I thought these elastic bands would be great to stay in place, but they slip off my head.  I have the no-slip ponytail holders and love them, but I am not happy with these.  I cannot get them to stay in place no matter what I do.  I have very fine, straight hair, so I don&#x27;t know if that is the problem.  There is no texture there to keep them in place.  I was extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cheap! The elastic started pealing immediately.</li>
    <li> These are very good for styling and holding dreads i recommend for men and women</li>
    <li> I am a 4C natural. I use these elastic bands to achieve the imfamous Afro puff. They are perfect and have lasted a whole year. I am increasing my supply in case I lose any.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about these! I was hoping to double them up and use them in a messy updo of a tutorial I saw on YouTube, but these headwraps/headbands do NOT stay in place! They also gave me a headache from pushing in on my skull. You&#x27;d think with the bands being so tight they&#x27;d stay in place, no such luck. So disappointing, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> The silicone lining on the inside of the headband helps to prevent it from constantly slipping although it depends on the texture of my hair from day to day. Slips less after hair is freshly washed. Doesn&#x27;t fall off as much as other elastic or cloth bands without the silicone on the one side.</li>
    <li> I gave this product two stars because I expected them to be comfortable and to stay in place while exercising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick long hair and wear a ponytail when exercising.  I wanted the headwrap to hold my bangs and small stray hairs away from my face to avoid sweat while in the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is that the headwrap slides back toward the ponytail and come off with vigorous exercise.  If I wear them really close to the hairline then stray hairs stick out behind the headwrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed and still looking for a solution so I don&#x27;t have to use multiple barrettes.</li>
    <li> Too fat for my personal preference but they worked well so I won&#x27;t take stars off due to my mistake</li>
    <li> The product is what I expected. Fits my head. I wear as a headband or as a large hair tie.</li>
    <li> The rubber part that&#x27;s supposed to be &amp;#34;no slip grip&amp;#34; cracks and breaks after only a couple uses.</li>
    <li> Great for doing a high bun on naturally course hair. It does not slip.</li>
    <li> Waste of money for me. I bought these in hopes that they could keep my hair out of my face during workouts, including something as gentle as yoga. They usually slide off by the time I walk to my car to drive to the gym.</li>
    <li> They are too tight and do not really stay in place on the head. it is good size just for my 8y.o.-daughter. She is happy!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews too often, I just read them. When I was reading the reviews for these headwraps, I thought to myself - naw, maybe the other reviewers writing this might just have big heads. Wrong. I should have believed everyone else when they say these run small - and aren&#x27;t stretchy at all. Wasted my money on these and now they go to the trash.</li>
    <li> Nice item at a very good price.</li>
    <li> not too tight on my head, but then again my hair is very thick. nevertheless, i use products that keep my hair moisturized, and i thought these might just slip all over the place.  to my delight, the no-slip grip held up!  if slippage is your concern, get these</li>
    <li> I really like these, they fit my head without sliding off.  Most headbands slide up my head til they come right off, not these.  I also use them as a ponytail holders.  I purchased in colors also</li>
    <li> I like these but they slip off all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Fine for wearing around the house but wouldn&#x27;t attempt out.</li>
    <li> Stays put on my head all day long, love the product, love the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality product.</li>
    <li> I have a short pixie style and needed something to change up the look. These headbands are great, they stay in place so I don&#x27;t have to readjust throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with headbands staying on my head- it is shaped odd and fill head bands always just immediately slip backwards and off. I thought maybe the grip on these would hold... but it doesn&#x27;t. Maybe for someone who has no trouble with slippage and just wants extra security for high-intensity workouts/sports/etc, but if you have an odd head and think these will stay on... they won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> They do slip and are a bit large. I went back to name brand bands that don&#x27;t slip!</li>
