<ol>
      <li>The product has always been an excellent.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my dad and he was very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>These razor blades look like something that was found in great granddads bathroom after his death at 110!  </li>
      <li>What can I say, this is an excellent blade for me.  </li>
      <li>He said the blades were very good.</li>
      <li>these are great</li>
      <li>That was a really great idea.  </li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>Great blades..</li>
      <li>the price is good.</li>
      <li>So glad I thought to look online!  </li>
      <li>Was using the 7 o&#x27; clock yellows, which I liked quite a bit.  </li>
      <li>About as good as the comparibly priced Shark Super Chrome.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think we can find a better blade than them :)</li>
      <li>The blades I purchased were manufactured in the India plant and I am pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>How do I safely dispose of used blades?</li>
      <li>I have used them in India for many years</li>
      <li>The price is right and it will give you a good shave</li>
      <li>Having used various high-quality blades; I can say that, for me, these are very good blades indeed.</li>
      <li>both of which are very good DE blades, however the platinum gives a smoother shave and longer lasting blade.</li>
      <li>When you compare the price and the quality of these blades its a easy five star rating.</li>
      <li>Provides a close smooth shave.</li>
      <li>cheap to do this.</li>
      <li>I am posting a one star review because of the company who filled the order.</li>
      <li>I heard good things about the Russian made blues, and couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>
      <li>I thought Super Platinum meant they would NOT rust.  </li>
      <li>It will be a toss-up between these two when I need to buy more blades unless I find one of them on sale or some other blade along the way that I happen to like better.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad razor, but I prefer the Gillette Blue Steel better.</li>
      <li>I have a thick bread..fast shipping and a great price..</li>
      <li>As for me, I&#x27;m buying more of the Blue Steel.</li>
      <li>I would have liked a place to put the used (but still sharp) blades.</li>
      <li>What really got me though was that they were in an envelop with one postage stamp</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a wide rage of DE blades and, at least for me, these have been the best ones I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on the fourth pack now and the blades are super sharp and comfortable, like the blades from the sampler that I tried.</li>
      <li>I would normally rate these blades 5 stars, but the blades did not come in a disposable plastic container that would accomodate used blades.  </li>
      <li>Well when I received my blades I was given 3 boxes of 7 and 4 loose blades that we&#x27;re not in original sealed packaging.</li>
      <li>I like the super platinum blades far better than the green or yellow line of gillette blades.</li>
      <li>Blade is sharp and smooth and works like a charm.  </li>
      <li>The first three of the five five-packs that I bought contained blades that felt like they had been used to cut open boxes.</li>
      <li>Next time I am buying blades that are specifically labeled stainless, or rustproof, or whatever.  </li>
      <li>the individual razor blade wrapping clearly says &amp;#34;not to be sold loose&amp;#34;.</li>

<li> These blades do a good job cutting through tough stubble and keep their edge for much longer than any other blades I&#x27;ve used so far.  ...cheaper than other Pt coated blades too.</li>
<li> Sharp blades, somewhere in the middle.</li>
<li> I have no idea about the condition of the loose blades, for all</li>
<li> These are indiviually wrapped, but loose in bundles of 5 held together with an elastic band.  </li>
<li> Be careful they are sharp.</li>
<li> the blades are sharp and the shave is close</li>
<li> Where they are made matters, they are not the same, not necessarily better or worse but not the same.</li>
<li> (I have dark tough facial hair so that is saying something!)</li>
<li> These just come in small cardboard boxes.</li>
<li> Dull and painful to shave with.</li>
<li> If your like me and hate spending money on the mach blades try this.</li>

    <li> Sharp blades, somewhere in the middle. I get a smooth shave (3 passes - with, against, across) and usually can skip two days of shaving afterwards with little stubble coming back. (I have dark tough facial hair so that is saying something!)</li>
    <li> Great blades..I use them twice and toss them away....cheap to do this. I have a thick bread..fast shipping and a great price..I will by these again..</li>
    <li> these are great you can get 4 shaves out of them. the price is good. the blades are sharp and the shave is close</li>
    <li> When you compare the price and the quality of these blades its a easy five star rating.I like the super platinum blades far better than the green or yellow line of gillette blades.</li>
    <li> The first three of the five five-packs that I bought contained blades that felt like they had been used to cut open boxes. Dull and painful to shave with. I&#x27;m on the fourth pack now and the blades are super sharp and comfortable, like the blades from the sampler that I tried. I have now idea what to expect from the last pack, and I will not be buying these blades again.</li>
    <li> I thought Super Platinum meant they would NOT rust.  Next time I am buying blades that are specifically labeled stainless, or rustproof, or whatever.  I will never use Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock blades ever again.</li>
    <li> These razor blades look like something that was found in great granddads bathroom after his death at 110!  They were individually wrapped (haven&#x27;t seen that since the 50s) and taped to a poorly cut up piece of light cardboard. And, some of the blades have rust and corrosion on them.  Definitely belonged to late,late grandpa.  What really got me though was that they were in an envelop with one postage stamp 55cents after I paid 3.99 for postage and &amp;#34;handling&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really sleazy product and presentation.</li>
    <li> So glad I thought to look online!  Like the blades. Wish they came in a plastic case with room for used blades on the back. That was a really great idea.  These just come in small cardboard boxes. How do I safely dispose of used blades?</li>
    <li> The product has always been an excellent. I have used them in India for many years and I found the same quality in USA as well. I don&#x27;t think we can find a better blade than them :)</li>
    <li> What can I say, this is an excellent blade for me.  About as good as the comparibly priced Shark Super Chrome.  It will be a toss-up between these two when I need to buy more blades unless I find one of them on sale or some other blade along the way that I happen to like better.  Having used various high-quality blades; I can say that, for me, these are very good blades indeed.</li>
    <li> Was using the 7 o&#x27; clock yellows, which I liked quite a bit.  I heard good things about the Russian made blues, and couldn&#x27;t resist.  I&#x27;ve tried a wide rage of DE blades and, at least for me, these have been the best ones I have ever used.  Blade is sharp and smooth and works like a charm.  Try them out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Will do again!</li>
    <li> I am posting a one star review because of the company who filled the order. The standard box has 5 blades however the boxes this company has have 2 bonus blades for a total of 7 per box. Well when I received my blades I was given 3 boxes of 7 and 4 loose blades that we&#x27;re not in original sealed packaging. There are two problems with that 1 the individual razor blade wrapping clearly says &amp;#34;not to be sold loose&amp;#34;. 2 I have no idea about the condition of the loose blades, for all I know they could be used or tampered with. The company wraps them in sealed packages for a reason why weren&#x27;t they shipped that way. Don&#x27;t bother calling amazon to complain, all you get is someone in India-which ironically is where the blades are made-who has a relatively low grasp of the English language and is no help at all.</li>
    <li> Great. Provides a close smooth shave. If your like me and hate spending money on the mach blades try this. Be careful they are sharp.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad and he was very happy with the product. He said the blades were very good.</li>
    <li> I would say their sharpness is between 7 o&#x27;clock stainless (green) and 7 o&#x27;clock sharp edge (yellow) both of which are very good DE blades, however the platinum gives a smoother shave and longer lasting blade. The blades I purchased were manufactured in the India plant and I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> These are not the Russian blades as shown, these are the blades from India.  There are multiple complaints on here about this but Amazon doesn&#x27;t correct it.  Where they are made matters, they are not the same, not necessarily better or worse but not the same.</li>
    <li> Not a bad razor, but I prefer the Gillette Blue Steel better. The price is right and it will give you a good shave so give it a whirl to see if you like them. Each persons face and stubble is different and you may give it a 5 star on the shave. As for me, I&#x27;m buying more of the Blue Steel. The 3 stars is for the shave only. The quality of the razor and delivery are 5 star.</li>
    <li> I would normally rate these blades 5 stars, but the blades did not come in a disposable plastic container that would accomodate used blades.  These are indiviually wrapped, but loose in bundles of 5 held together with an elastic band.  I would have liked a place to put the used (but still sharp) blades.</li>
    <li> These blades do a good job cutting through tough stubble and keep their edge for much longer than any other blades I&#x27;ve used so far.  ...cheaper than other Pt coated blades too.</li>
