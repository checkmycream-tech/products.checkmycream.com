      <li>In summation: The  absolute best, most innovative , &amp;#34;Great Hair Day&amp;#34;, product within all professional hair &amp; styling sprays (+ heat protection, setting spray , blow out spay,  hold, flexible hairspray to ever hit the product shelved!  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold my fine hair as well as I would like it to.</li>
      <li>Works great, isn&#x27;t heavy, and smells really nice.</li>
      <li>This product is almost magical in it&#x27;s ability to provide effective soft hold.  </li>
      <li>It almost feels like you&#x27;re just spraying a light mist over your hair for no reason.</li>
      <li>This whole line of products is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Light and flexible.</li>
      <li>My hair feels great and seems to flex back into shape if I scrunch my hair a bit.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find a lightweight hairspray that I loved as much as Aveda Air Control, but this has quickly become my new favorite!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a significant investment, but one</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be true.  </li>
      <li>Having fine, straight hair, I don&#x27;t have a huge need for super hold hairspray, I just want a light hold to use as a finishing spray.</li>
      <li>This is seriously the best hairspray I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This innovative, multiple use medium hold, flexible product gives outstanding results whatever way you choose to use.</li>
      <li>I use this hairspray to set hot rollers and then lightly spray my hair.</li>
      <li>I have medium-long, fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>I have straight fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I already reviewed this fantastic product, so I bought it in large and travel size.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>Holds great and does not make hair stiff.</li>
      <li>I also use the LP Restore thermal protection spray, which gives just the right amount of shine and keeps my hair from being damaged by heated styling tools.  </li>
      <li>It seems to hold all day just the right amount.</li>
      <li>If your hair is hard to hold, then this styling spray/hairspray is a great product to try.  </li>
      <li>I know how much of a mark up is on hair care products, but these are worth the price.</li>
      <li>I love having a hairspray that keeps the overall style of my hair while adding flexibility to have the hair move around.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally willing to make.  </li>
      <li>And it hasn&#x27;t ever gotten flaky on me if I run a hot iron over it after spraying or anything.</li>
      <li>Thus is my hands down favorite!</li>
      <li>At a much higher price I expected more than what I received</li>
      <li>For the price of this I expected much more.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
      <li>I really like the Living Proof products</li>
      <li>I will stay with my Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;Express Dry&amp;#34; hairspray that really works.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair manageable thru out the day and really tames the flyaways (Which I have a lot of) .  </li>
      <li>This spray defines and holds my curls really well.  </li>
      <li>It does not hold very well.</li>
      <li>I would never spend that much on hairspray until I tried this.</li>
      <li>It is just the right amount of hold while still being soft.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it on Amazon, since other brick stores in my area which sell Living Proof don&#x27;t seem to carry this.</li>
      <li>Ok but not worth the money</li>
      <li>I hate having &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; hair, but most light hair spray couldn&#x27;t give effective hold.  </li>
      <li>and I live in Florida which is saying a lot!).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought it would be different or better then my regular &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; hair spray but it wasn&#x27;t and it was way more expensive than I would like for something ok.. not great...</li>
    <li> Living Proof products are bar none - they are the reason I can hold my pin up styles so long and restyle easily without a flaky mess.</li>
    <li> I go crazy for this hairspray. I usually wouldn&#x27;t purchase hairspray this expensive when they have decent ones out there for much cheaper, but when I read that Kim Kardashian used it on her wedding day and saw her pictures I was so curious that I caved and bought it. :)&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, so I just have my cheap drugstore hairspray on hand for when I just have my hair up or something, and then use this for when it&#x27;s down and I want to give my hair that look of soft movement but with the ability to bounce back to how I styled it. The bottle will last me much longer this way.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is quite thin and I usually find that finishing sprays either don&#x27;t do enough for it (it&#x27;s so fine, it really needs some muscle behind the spray to keep it in place), or heavier sprays weigh it down. This spray has really been the best ever for me. It seems to hold all day just the right amount. Oh! And it hasn&#x27;t ever gotten flaky on me if I run a hot iron over it after spraying or anything. I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be loyal to this brand for a very long time!</li>
    <li> From a Self-confessed, so called &amp;#34;Product Junkie&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used numerous other professional Top line hair sprays.  This innovative, multiple use medium hold, flexible product gives outstanding results whatever way you choose to use. This highly diverse product can be used on  WET  &amp; DRY hair as a:  styling tool ^ volume ( with flexible hold), Blow out spray, setting tool for:  Hot rollers, velcros, flat/waving iron, or your choice if hot tools while providing heat protection , shine, a flexible, hold with no stickiness on both wet &amp; dry hair. Use on WET hair, as a setting spay, heat protector, shine induced.  In summation: The  absolute best, most innovative , &amp;#34;Great Hair Day&amp;#34;, product within all professional hair &amp; styling sprays (+ heat protection, setting spray , blow out spay,  hold, flexible hairspray to ever hit the product shelved!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> Great sprays! Gives hold but not sticky. Allies you to run fingered through your hair and still maintain style. Looks natural even on thin hair. Thus is my hands down favorite!</li>
    <li> I have medium-long, fine, straight hair. I wasn&#x27;t able to make this stuff work as a styling spray: it just didn&#x27;t give me the kind of manageability or volume I was hoping for. However, it is a really nice finishing spray. My style lasts all day and isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff, which is how other sprays can make it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find a lightweight hairspray that I loved as much as Aveda Air Control, but this has quickly become my new favorite! Having fine, straight hair, I don&#x27;t have a huge need for super hold hairspray, I just want a light hold to use as a finishing spray. This works great for that purpose and has an AMAZING smell. It also works great as a heat styler with velcro rollers--I just put the velcro rollers in, get  short blast of my blow dryer and a quick shot of hairspray.</li>
    <li> Ok but not worth the money</li>
    <li> Not too heavy, I like using it.</li>
    <li> Best Hairspray I&#x27;ve tried in a long time</li>
    <li> It is Ok. Makes hair a little sticky if you put to much on your hair, but if you use just a little, is OK. Not better than other, cheaper hairsprays. I will use it because I bought it, but I will not buy again, nor recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray</li>
    <li> I really like the Living Proof products but I do not like the smell of this hairspray.  Too bad because it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I use this hairspray to set hot rollers and then lightly spray my hair. Never feels stiff or sticky. It is the best I have ever bought. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Nice flexible hold.  It is just the right amount of hold while still being soft.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a year or longer. I use it as a styling spray on damp hair &amp; sometime on dry hair. Living proof makes wonderful products.</li>
    <li> I am not a hair spray sort of girl,  but I feel in love with this hairspray.  It keeps my hair manageable thru out the day and really tames the flyaways (Which I have a lot of) .  Without a doubt it is my favorite hairspray</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this when it was included a sample with another Living Proof product.  By far the BEST hair spray I have ever used.  I hate having &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; hair, but most light hair spray couldn&#x27;t give effective hold.  This product is almost magical in it&#x27;s ability to provide effective soft hold.  My hair feels great and seems to flex back into shape if I scrunch my hair a bit.  Awesome product.  So glad I found it on Amazon, since other brick stores in my area which sell Living Proof don&#x27;t seem to carry this.</li>
    <li> You can spray, and touch your hair to style it a tad more, spray, and move your hair yet into another place, and spray more.. it doesnt get sticky. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love this spray...the best styling spray I have ever used.....just spray on you dry hair and put in place.......great stuff</li>
    <li> My hair is normally shiny, but this spray made my hair dull, frizzy, &amp; dry. I was extremely disappointed.  Please do not waste your money on this item.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite hair spray. I am a professional stylist, and I am hooked on Living Proof, paying retail for their products kills me, I normally can buy professional products for wholesale price, and I know how much of a mark up is on hair care products, but these are worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great light-weight but strong hold spray.  It smells great too!  I&#x27;ll buy more!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I received a sample of this when my other product did not arrive...... And I absolutely love it! I would never spend that much on hairspray until I tried this. I am hooked. Holds great and does not make hair stiff.</li>
    <li> Its perfect! Not stiff and sticky. Yet provides flexible hold for your hair. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> This hairspray is lightweight and holds well.  The fragrance is a bit stronger than I would like.</li>
    <li> Did not perform as promised. At a much higher price I expected more than what I received</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite hair spray. Good hold! No crunch! Amazing smell!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have very thin hair and this spray gives my hair body without weighing it down and making it flat.</li>
    <li> Great hold without stiffness.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I already reviewed this fantastic product, so I bought it in large and travel size.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This whole line of products is amazing.  I have straight fine hair.  I rely on this for blow outs and volume.  It&#x27;s expensive but a must have for me.  Of all the living proof stuff this is my favorite.  Granted, I&#x27;m no Jennifer Anniston, but my hair looks good for a Mom.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair soft yet it hold without looking stiff.</li>
    <li> Works great, isn&#x27;t heavy, and smells really nice.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!  Perfect</li>
    <li> It does not hold very well. I heard about it on the Today Show where they gave it glowing remarks. After I spray the front sides of my hair the hair falls forward anyway. For the price of this I expected much more. Even cheapie Suave hairspray does better than this product. I will stay with my Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;Express Dry&amp;#34; hairspray that really works. Don&#x27;t waste your money on &amp;#34;Living Proof&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best hairspray I have ever used. I love having a hairspray that keeps the overall style of my hair while adding flexibility to have the hair move around. My secret is spraying the hairspray on a brush, and brushing it through my hair. Works like a charm every time! It&#x27;s super lightweight but has a lot of flex, but if you&#x27;re looking for uber hold, this may not be the best hairspray for you.</li>
    <li> I use this hairspray as a styling spray and as a final hairspray.  After using Living Proof No Frizz shampoo and conditioner (really good, btw), I apply the LP Prime Style Extender from roots to ends.  I then use this styling spray on wet hair and let it air dry overnight.  In the morning I use a curling iron to create loose waves.  This spray defines and holds my curls really well.  I can honestly say that I can&#x27;t feel any product in my hair, it&#x27;s absolutely invisible and yet it definitely holds my hard-to-hold hair even into the next day.  After running my fingers through the curls to loosen them up a bit, I spray Flex Shaping Hairspray over my finished style for extra security in high humidity.  When the humidity is normal or low, however, I don&#x27;t need the additional spritz.  And this spray doesn&#x27;t smell of chemicals the way so many hairsprays do.  Using these Living Proof products, I have a good hair day almost every day.  Using the shampoo, conditioner and primer means that I can go several days without having to shampoo my hair.  These products promise that they will keep the hair cleaner longer and for me, they have lived up to that claim.  This hairspray is not sticky or stiff and it doesn&#x27;t flake, giving very natural hold that lasts.  The Prime Style Extender is supposed to increase the effectiveness of styling products and keep the finished style in place for several days.  I&#x27;ve found this to be true.  I&#x27;m so impressed by this line of hair care products that I&#x27;ve switched up my regimen.  Being able to skip a shampoo or two keeps my color treated hair fresh and bright.  I also use the LP Restore thermal protection spray, which gives just the right amount of shine and keeps my hair from being damaged by heated styling tools.  All of the LP products have lived up to the hype.  Yes, they are expensive but I&#x27;m no longer wasting money on inferior products that end up in my hall closet (where the products I don&#x27;t use go to die).  I&#x27;m really happy I&#x27;ve had great hair days using these products (something unheard of for me).  It&#x27;s a significant investment, but one I&#x27;m totally willing to make.  If your hair is hard to hold, then this styling spray/hairspray is a great product to try.  Oh, and I get absolutely no frizz whatsoever (and I live in Florida which is saying a lot!).  I definitely recommend this LP spray.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair spray. It works especially well after you have styled your hair. I would also buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold my fine hair as well as I would like it to.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Holds my hair firmly but softly.  Great soft spray and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Did not work in my hair, but I have especially difficult hair</li>
    <li> This product worked ok but I could not stand the scent. I am sure that some may either not mind it or even rally love it but it made me feel sick. As I said, it did seem to work ok, however, I have purchased drugstore products that were just as good &amp; they did not cost half what this did. Even if I liked the smell, I would not spend this much money for a product that only performed average.</li>
    <li> this works great on my fine hair and really adds to the hold of a curl</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray!  Light and flexible.</li>
    <li> I just discovered this product line, as I ws given a few samples with my purchase from Sephora.. I have fallen in love with their hair products.</li>
    <li> expensive but worth it.  Took a while to get the product</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in this product... There&#x27;s not much to it. It almost feels like you&#x27;re just spraying a light mist over your hair for no reason.</li>
