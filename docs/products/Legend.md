<li> The only negative is that it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of staying power.  </li>
<li> Its not filled to the full size of the bottle you have to scrape off the black to see for yourself.</li>

<li> So small you can use it only once</li>
<li> To small for how big it looks in picture</li>

<li> No I am not satisfied with this product</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t what I saw really not happy with it</li>
<li> but the disappointment is that although the bottle is small there is a partition inside of it.</li>

    <li> No I am not satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> This is amazing fragrance.  Cant keep my wife off of me and I love it.</li>
    <li> Opinion(3rd cologne review of 4): good scent, but not the best. I like that isn&#x27;t overbearing. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t grate on your nerves. I like it, but don&#x27;t love it. This is a scent you can try in the sample size if you don&#x27;t want to go all out and buy the larger bottle.</li>
