<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This did &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me! I am allergic to latex, which is the glue for faux lashes. I actually have blond straight long lashes. So, I curl, and apply my waterproof marcara first. This holds the curl. Then I had a really fun time tryng my 3D lash mascara. What a great product! Just do each eye separately.  My eyes looked luxurious, and sexy. Gorgeous. I looked at a few fiber mascara brands, I&#x27;m glad I choose this one. I have sensitive eyes, along with an optic nerve disease.  The medicine (drops) I use at night dry my eyes, and in morning painful and blurry for awhile. This does not affect my eyes, or add to irritation whatsoever. This is not difficult, it is using marcara, just switching to two tubes. Most women use multiple mascara anyway. This is a must for super sensual, finished look. Im happy!!!!</li>
    <li> I would have given this a 5 star rating because it definitely gives the volume.  Unfortunately, the fibers irritate my eyes.  I can only imagine if one wore contact lenses... This would not work!</li>
    <li> This was easy to use (I&#x27;m not much of a makeup guru) and lasted all day, it did not fall off or smudge. I oil cleanse my face every night and it came off super easy. I really like that its made with natural ingredients. It made my eyelashes look fuller and longer, overall i really like it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!!! It works so well. I have long thin eyelashes so this gives it volume and length! I get sooo many compliments. Really recommend this!!! And shipping was fast too(:</li>
    <li> I bought this without unreal expectations. I expected it to be a generic &amp;#34;younique 3D lash&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s as good, if not better than the brand younique! Works great! Shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> This mascara makes my thin lashes look long and full. It&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on all day without flaking or smudging.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  So easy and fun to use.</li>
    <li> Let me just start off by saying what great customer service this company has or the seller,  either way I was very impressed with the follow up emails they sent and the helpful hints.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is very interesting, easy to follow the instructions and works pretty well. I only gave it a 4 star because it didn&#x27;t stay on as well as I had hoped it would,  based on other reviews. When it comes off it leaves tiny little flecks of black on your upper eye and below your eye. But that didn&#x27;t happen until 7+ hours. I do have naturally long Lashes and maybe that was the problem, they were hitting my upper eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;For the money, the great customer service and the practical use that provides a dramatic look with minimal effort, I suggest you try this. I&#x27;m telling my sisters about it!</li>
    <li> My lashes never looked so fuller and longer ... I love Simply lash product , I can use it everyday and it last all day without any fuss and smear, it works great for every day use and for special occasions!! Love using it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying 3D lashes and I have to say.. I&#x27;m really impressed! I&#x27;ve never really been that into makeup, but this might just change that. Lol. The packaging is beautiful - simple and elegant...and not a cheap case by any means. Seems like it&#x27;s very well made. I don&#x27;t notice any irritation, although I did get a few bits of fiber in my eyes (although somehow I always manage to get some form of makeup in my eyes, not matter what it is...lol). All in all, I&#x27;m super impressed. PS - I&#x27;ve tried false lashes and... no. Those are impossible for me to put on. This, however, I can do myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Included a photo of regular mascara and this one. Huge difference! Ignore my uneven eyebrows - like I said not hugely into makeup, so I&#x27;m still learning.</li>
    <li> I tried 3D fiber mascara today for the first time and I was shocked at how long and natural my lashes looked. I&#x27;d given up on wearing mascara at all because my lashes are short and blonde...invisible. I&#x27;m still getting used to the dramatic difference. As long and lush as false eyelashes..which are way too much trouble. 3D gives you the same effect--although I&#x27;m still tweaking it a bit. The real surprise for me was that it works on both top and lower lashes...so my lashes look natural, not the least bit fake. So far I love this stuff. But will check back after a couple more tries.</li>
    <li> This is the best 3D mascara that I have ever used. Also, it&#x27;s the easiest to use. I have bought this product several times. My lashes look amazing. I will buy this mascara as long as I can. It&#x27;s amazing. I run between 3 and 5 miles a day and it never runs, smears, or wears off.</li>
    <li> I love it. I never seen my eyes lashes that long and beautiful with any other mascaras.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian with thin short lashes. This is a miracle mascara. Now I can get amazing lashes without having to try those false sticky ones. I&#x27;m never going back to anything else but this.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! The first time I applied it, it looked amazing but was uncomfortable and hurt my eyes. After trying the product out a few times I realized it was because I didn&#x27;t coat the fibers with enough gel. I now usually coat them with two layers just to be safe. My eyelashes look like falsies they are so long and thick. I am in love with this product!</li>
    <li> Totally in love with this product!  Easy to apply and the my lashes look amazing! I&#x27;m so happy that there&#x27;s an alternative to false lashes.</li>
    <li> I really like it!! Works nice and I love the results</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> the product irritates   my eyes because I have  sensitive eyes but other  than that I love it. It makes  my eyelashes look way  longer an beautiful,  I have  never had a  mascara make  my eyelashes so huge!! I&#x27;m  so excited about this product.  Their brushes are usually too  big for my lashes and end up  smearing all over my lids,  However, I&#x27;m completely impressed with this mascara.  I like the small, flexible brush  that can comb through my  lashes.The price is good not  bad at all. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I kept seeing the Younique mascara and wanted to try a fiber lash mascara but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay $35 for it so I found this one and was nervous about buying it but I love it. I use 2-3 coats and my lashes look amazing. One tip would be to curl your eye lashes first. My lashes look long and think.</li>
    <li> My lashes look great. It&#x27;s easy to use and the packaging Is perfect..</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this mascara!</li>
    <li> This is a lot less messy than the other ones I have tried... It waterproof and long lasting...</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! Does everything it says...I&#x27;m completely hooked!</li>
    <li> I love having full, realistic looking lashes.  I have worn individual lashes for years on special occasions, but this product allows me to get that look without having to go have individuals applied.  It wasn&#x27;t difficult to use and seems to clean up pretty easily.  I love the look.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great!! I wasn&#x27;t about to spend over $35 on the other brand, so after the great reviews about this, I gave it a try. I love it! It&#x27;s great because I can either make my lashes appear simple (1-2 coats) or I can make them really stand out (3-4 coats). I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product and much easier to apply than I would have thought.  Stays on even after sleeping with it on. Much cheaper alternative to lash extension and so much easier to apply than the false lashes.</li>
    <li> I am certain that for a person who already has a decent set of lashes this product would work well.  However, being older and needing to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; where there just aren&#x27;t that many lashes to begin with, I will tell you the mascara is &#x27;noticeable&#x27;.  I simply wanted a natural look and the fibers in this really add thickness as well as length.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to keep working with this product, perhaps limiting the amount of fibers applied by brush. I think it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
    <li> Awesome! The first time I used this, I knew I loved it! I have short eyelashes, and this really gave me longer lashes. Easy to apply and comes off when you want it to. I apply in the morning and I am all set for the day! Never tried 3d lashes before because of the price, but wanted to try it and now I am hooked! Will buy more and would recommend!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I am inspired to write my first ever product review. I really didn&#x27;t think this stuff was going to work as pretty much nothing I have tried has really worked, My eyelashes are almost non-existent, I have to curl them with a lash curler as they are dead straight and I usually have to pile on layers of mascara to get it to look like anything is there at all. I opened the packet and following the instructions, cautiously applied one layer  to my lashes and it looked pretty good, lashes were very long and thick and curved beautifully upwards, I wanted to add another coat as my lashes are so thin but thought I had better leave it to see what happened. I went to sleep and when I got up in the morning the lashes still looked great - no flaking, no smudging just perfectly curved and glamorous. I applied another coat and they looked even better, outrageously good actually. I have been working 24/7 on a project with a deadline and haven&#x27;t touched them for 2 days and they still look like I have just walked out of a beauty salon. I still can&#x27;t believe or understand how this product works but I am sold.</li>
    <li> Excellent. My eyelashes look amazing. Longer and fuller.  As a bonus it cleans off really nicely too.</li>
    <li> The gel climbs and overflows. I will be purchasing A different brand from now on.</li>
    <li> Love this product, my lashes are long, dramatic( if more then 1coat) and fierce. I will be a repeat customer for life!</li>
    <li> The supposed to be gel came out dry I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like.  Clumps up!!</li>
    <li> Like all fiber mascaras I have bought and used, this particular  3D mascara seems to work better after a couple of uses, maybe because of less clumps in the mascara tube?  In any case this fiber mascara does seem to stay on better than most, I&#x27;m guessing because it&#x27;s waterproof.  The &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; that works best for me is to apply very little of the fibers after the transplanting gel, which keeps the clumps down. (The little dry brush that comes with the kit is helpful too!)  My final review is that I would probably buy this mascara again, as long as the price stays reasonable (under $24) and it&#x27;s waterproof!</li>
    <li> This mascara is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It keeps a curl, it doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake and gives amazing volume! I&#x27;m still working on getting all the length I want, but that&#x27;s on me. I&#x27;m still working on a learning curve. Lastly, this seller is awesome! She contacted me as soon as I placed my order and also contacted me the day it was supposed to arrive. I will absolutely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> One word.... Amazing!!!!! I literally have long lashes now!</li>
    <li> When you get older your lashes become so invisible.  This product is amazing and it doesn&#x27;t look fake just winderful!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Not as great as I thought and the fibers will fall into your eyes and I was constantly brushing them off my cheeks. Maybe if u spend more time with it though and give your eyelashes at least 5 treatments... I just can get my eyelashes bigger and fuller using my walmart (whoever) brand mascara.</li>
    <li> For the Price it&#x27;s a very very good product. I really love it.</li>
    <li> This mascara actually make my lashes look more longer.. I did notice a difference with and without it. I notice that it is kinda lumpy after applying but I hope to play around with it more and maybe I can find a better way to apply it without looking so lumpy. Overall great mascara!</li>
    <li> Amazing...what a complete difference...</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I was given a UTUBE video of HOW TO instructions and it works exactly as video said it would. I am very pleased with the results of just one try.  &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> At first I was confused as I had never seen 3D mascara before! But this is amazing!! It is so much better than glue on lashes!  Make sure you read the instructions on how to apply properly. I didn&#x27;t and wasted some. Once I read the instructions it was wonderful! Great for weddings, photo shoots or just special occasions!</li>
    <li> I buy tons of stuff off of Amazon, but I don&#x27;t write reviews unless the product is spectacular.....and this really is.  I have Almond-shaped eyes with straight thin lashes. Most of the time I don&#x27;t wear mascara because I like a natural look and most mascaras are clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not like other mascaras!!!!  When I first put it on, I thought oh, no too dark and too much, but I then took a regular eyelash brush (no mascara) and brushed them out and omg!!!  Looked so natural and so pretty.  I&#x27;m only going to use this mascara from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my brows (thin) and wow!  Worked.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this w/o brushing it out though, but that&#x27;s b/c I&#x27;m light with blonde hair and it&#x27;s too harsh for me.  Some people like that look and it looks nice with their dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Works great and easy to apply! Have paid more for this product but won&#x27;t anymore! This product works perfectly!!</li>
    <li> Very happy will order again</li>
    <li> I love this mascara :) I used it for the first time yesterday and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble applying. This really makes your eyes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; which is the goal! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This concept is good. My problem is I always feel like I have something in my eye. Yes I did seal them. It did make my lashes Fuller but I just couldn&#x27;t get the length out of it like I thought I would.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used such a product however I found it simple to apply and easy to use.  It made my lashes look longer and much fuller.  I did not experience irritation nor did my eyelashes start falling out -- which has happened to me when using some mascara brands in the past -- as my skin and especially my eyes are very sensitive to synthetic, chemical based make-up. The case and presentation is professional. I think it is one of the classiest products of its type out there today!</li>
    <li> I like this better then younique</li>
    <li> Can I just say WOW!!! Just got this in the mail a day earlier than expected and immediately tried it out. I only applied one coat of gel, fibers, then gel again on top of my normal mascara as instructed and what a huge difference. In the picture I attached the top is me with my normal &amp;#34;lengthening&amp;#34; mascara. Then bottom 3 pics (forgive the creepy eye shot) are with the 3d fiber lashes right now. It made a huge difference!!! It&#x27;s soft feeling and smells good lol. I will be showering later and will see if it really hold up in water and will let you all know. I hate applying false lashes and scared of reactions I have seen to eyelash extensions. So far this is a great alternative that has some nice natural ingredients. Yay for this purchase!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to apply and many compliments. My friend also purchased and she also likes it.</li>
    <li> The masara gel is alittle drippy but it does add volumn to lashes. I used adouble coat to ensure the look of thicker lashes.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed Cosmetologist and make up artist and I am always looking for new products to try on my clients. I love product!</li>
    <li> I love it thank you so much! I will definitely be buying again soon.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time and love it. I wanted to enhance my lashed without buying false eyelashes and so far they bring my lashes to a whole new level. Plus it is easy to apply. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> So happy with it :D! Works great!</li>
    <li> This is marvelous, and just as good as the add says. A novice may have to do some practicing, but overall is just great!</li>
    <li> Worked 12 hours in the sun had only a few fibers fall off .</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. It takes longer to apply but its worth it. I wear contacts and so far i havent had any problems</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara.  I ended up buying it for my mother in law who frequently tries to use false eyelashes. I demonstrated it for her and she is so excited. I definitely recommend this product, even for daily wear.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter to try because she has complained about her lashes thinning some, she always had nice long thick lashes. OMG!!! We were both amazed!  So now I am back to order myself some. Great product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mascara!!!</li>
    <li> It works well, I would buy again. (:</li>
    <li> Awsome product. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s $19 first of all. I have to apply at least 3 times to make my eyes look in the way I wanted too. The fact that it&#x27;s $19, I expected more than what I got. Now, I go back and use my drug store mascara, the $8 one, it works the same. Kinda waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love it, I have received a lot of good compliments using this new mascara</li>
    <li> Glad I read all the reviews.  Great mascara!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and it really works.  We all have bought products  that claim to do what they say but found out we wasted our money. This does exactly what it claims too do. The company is great to follow up and make sure you received the product and are a happy customer.  I appreciate that. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> It does what it says. My lashes were fuller and longer. However,  my eyes are very very sensitive and the fuller lashes translated to actual discomfort for me. I constantly felt like something was in my eyes. If it weren&#x27;t for that, which truly is a personal issue, I would have rated higher.</li>
    <li> You can decide how long you want your lashes.  I played with it and did three coats and they were long!  You need to start with a coating of  &amp;#34;your favorite mascara&amp;#34; so this is in addition to your normal mascara not a replacement.</li>
    <li> The Simply 3d fiber lash mascara is the best out there.  Not only is this mascara fabulous, I&#x27;ve received phenomenal customer service directly from the owners.  When I purchased the Simply lash science 3D volume mascara, I was so impressed with the packaging &amp; details.  I&#x27;m not a fan of false lashes; I can&#x27;t ever put them on correctly, but they will in time cause damage to your own lashes &amp; going to have your lashes glued on also can cause major damages.  Simply 3D gives you the same results of false lashes, but comes of very easily with simple remover.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s one of the best products out there.  Trust me, I&#x27;ve been a mascara &amp;#34; junkie&amp;#34; my whole life looking for something that&#x27;s easy to use, gives you the long lashes &amp; comes off easily.  I highly recommend this products!!!</li>
    <li> I just received this product today. I was so excited to try it! Now the question is worth it or wasted. Yes it is pricey for a mascara, but I must say it is well worth it and far less cheaper than getting professional falsies! As for me I was tired of wearing falsies, the irritating glues that ultimately thinned my already sparse short lashes... I wanted to try to regrow what was left and vowed to never wear falsie again... I continued searching on the internet, for a mascara that would give me dramatic bold looking eyelashes, guess what I found it ladies, 3D Mascara! Takes no more than 10 minutes to apply if you want natural length and volume, and if you prefer a bold look like me, just apply the product evenly 1 or 2 times more:  a light coat of your favorite mascara, apply gel and fibers, repeat until desired length and thickness, that&#x27;s it!  it&#x27;s just my honest opinion! I am a verified user and not paid to endorse this product, just here to tell you it works!</li>
    <li> This product has turned my pale short thin eyelashes into these thick long lashes that I just love!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this gorgeously presented amazing product as it has not only achieved the promised results but has made this tired looking mum feel prettier.&lt;br /&gt;I am no make up pro but this was very easy to apply and took very little time out of my busy morning.&lt;br /&gt;Yes. Loving it! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It works and adds length and volume but it&#x27;s in addition to mascara... It&#x27;s not waterproof, but overall I like it and will probably order again</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe its hypoallergenic...really made my eyes itch!! Gave it away</li>
    <li> I Really liked it, not heavy on my lashes, no bad chemical odor. I tried a cheaper version that my friend had and it gave me a headache. This one did not.I dnt wear everyday bit on my mini vacation I put in on and swam with it on beach and pool. Lasts pretty good. Of course I wasn&#x27;t surfing or diving.</li>
    <li> Barely extends my lashes and the fibers keep getting in my eye even after putting on the gel mascara thing</li>
    <li> Really work&#x27;s!! I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love love this mascara.....incredible company.....caring staff ...with lots of tips on how to get the best use of this product.....easy to use .....big thank you to Jaimie</li>
    <li> I tired for the first time yesterday. I put a mascara lightly, let it dry for awhile, then I applied the gel and fiber mascara. The fiber fell all over my face. It made my face looks like I have black hairs on all over my face. It was really annoying. I read the reviews before I purchased it. I guess it works for a lot of people but not me. I rather buy a really good 20 dollar mascara. Is there a trick to use this product? I followed the instruction, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I would like to return the item but I don&#x27;t know how well that&#x27;s gonna be since I used once.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I was doing it right , my eye lashes looked longer as I wished but some how the little dry stuff from it fail in my eyes , pain n uncomfortable.. Wished they have note on every single massacra so I w know which one should add on first .. But still like it  + Update : been for months since I bought it ,after my first review ,Louise  ,(guess thats customer service )contact me immately ,asked me what was issued that I was not 100 % happy with my purchased and than showed me how to use it ,not just 1 times but back and forth a lot of times .. wow ,so impress with the service and ,caring ..and yes ,finally I knew how to do it :) Thanks Louise ,ur service is the best ..W like to do business again</li>
    <li> Hate It!!!!!! It is awful to put on!!! Will stay will my other brand!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I just got it this morning and was glad because I have a party to attend tonight. I just finished my makeup and wow this product is truly amazing. All the reviews that were positive were so spot on. It&#x27;s like putting on false eyelashes but without that hassle! I am about to order another to have as a backup. If you want great looking long full lashes you must get this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought the Younique brand from a friend who held an online party. I loved it except the fibers clumped up and seemed to dry up. Plus it was expensive since shipping was also charged. I figured I would buy something similar for cheaper on Amazon, get free prime shipping, and receive it quicker. However, the gel in this is really goopy and messy. The fibers are perfect. Luckily, I still had the gel left from the Younique brand so I am using that along with the fibers from this set. I will probably not buy this brand again. Amazon had many to choose from - I will try a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> Amazing results. I have very short lashes and this product makes them seem so long. I love it.</li>
    <li> i really like this. It makes you lashes look fake. the product last about 3-4 hours then you would have to reapply. over all satisfied</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The package is beautiful and classy and the instructions are simple and straight forward. I tried it right away. My lashes are quite light and thin. It gave it that volume and dark color that I wanted. Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am very impressed with the 3d lashes.  The second time I used it I liked it even more, I felt like I did a better job applying it.  It made my lashes a lot longer and fuller.  Very excited about this product.  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Thick lashes in no time.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I have very fine, short lashes.  This product is the first that gave me long, lush eyelashes ( I&#x27;ve tried many).  I&#x27;m very happy and I would wear it every day if I could.  Also I had no problem removing the mascara.  I will be ordering it again and I&#x27;ve told my daughter and friends about it.</li>
    <li> I have used the other brands and I  absolutely  love the simply  brand . I have small eyes and the other  brand  would rub off. Simply is water proof  and I  can wear it all day and not have to apply it again. Coodos to you Simply.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Not the easiest to get off. Not as dramatic as I expected when Compared to other mascaras.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! I&#x27;ve tried other products similar to this and after the first few applications it would turn very sticky and make it harder to catch every lash.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was thinking about trying this stuff from another retailer which was more expensive. I saw it on amazon and that it had great reviews son I decided to try it. I love this stuff does what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> Great product! Last all day and no raccoon eyes!</li>
    <li> It so awesome. It look nature and pretty</li>
    <li> I had never tried fibers before.  It&#x27;s interesting.  I read the instructions and did exactly what it said.  Worked fine.</li>
    <li> Adds a lot of length and volume. A bit time consuming but worth it</li>
    <li> It is amazing. I thought I had lashes, but now they are really dramatic. I will be getting one for my two daughters. I found the youtube video really helpful.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I have ever used!  Love it love it love it!!!! Will never use any other again!</li>
    <li> Love this! Quality as good as more expensive brand:)</li>
    <li> Awful I bought this because ofthe great reviews. It&#x27;s so Messy! I have used Loreal for years it&#x27;s so much better. I threw this away.It flakes you look like you have black eyes. Just so awful.</li>
    <li> ...this is it! Best mascara ever! SO glad I bought this. Super easy to apply, no irritation, no flaking- goodbye glue and lashes!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the more expensive 3D lashes</li>
    <li> This mascara is awesome!!! It was delivered quickly as well! Will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Was very easy to apply. Looks very natural if you use the brush in between gel applications. It makes your eyes standout and really pop!  No problem with lashes falling out. Love your product!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Really works. Use wax, my favorite mascara, gel, fibers, &amp; gel again to seal. My lashes are enormous. Very easy to remove with a gentle eye make-up remover. Will be buying this brand again. Price is very reasonable &amp; works as well or better than the competition. ❤️</li>
    <li> Bought this in hopes of just using mascara rather than wearing false lashes for my sister&#x27;s upcoming wedding. Long story short - false lashes will not be needed. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other fiber lash mascaras, specifically Better than Falsies by Two Faced. While I liked the effect, I did not like how sticky it made my lashes or that it would leave little fibers on my lid. This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve tried, and I am something of a mascara junkie. No stickiness, no little black dots on my lid, and no raccoon eyes (even after a long night of dancing) ... Just LONG, voluminous, curly lashes. I&#x27;ve had several people ask if I have been wearing false lashes. Girls at work have since ordered, as well as my mom, and I definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I am not one to post reviews...but oh WOW!! Where has this been all my life?!! Amazing! It&#x27;s not at all clumpy if you use the brush that comes with it and brush the lashes right after you apply the fibers. It looks amazing and the loose fibers wisp away off the face with a brush. This will be a purchase I will make forever! A++ in my book!</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time and fast....my lashes are awesome. ...I love it! !! ...I really appreciate that. ...THANKYOU. ....</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! I&#x27;ve always wanted longer lashes but didn&#x27;t want to go the way of false lashes. When I heard about Simply 3D being made from natural ingredients I was excited to try this it. I was pleased to find that it was a really simple process to apply my new, natural lashes! It was like adding feathers...beautiful new wings!!! Love it💖  The first picture is one coat of regular mascara, the second with  regular mascara and one coat of simply 3-D lash.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!! So glad I tried it. It is absolutely smudge and waterproof. Can wear to the gym with no problems. Lashes look lush and very natural. Great product</li>
    <li> I have only used the gel and lash fibers for 2 days and I do like how it makes my lashes look more full and longer. However, it seems it takes a lot to get enough fibers on the brush to deposit it on your lashes. I am not sure if the gel is making the fibers stick more to the brush so that they do not deposit on to my lashes, or if it&#x27;s the brush? I am comparing this to another fiber product I bought that goes directly over your mascara, (a gel product did not come with it). The brush seems to hold and deposit more fibers on the lashes compared to the tube of fibers included with this product. I will keep using as I love the gel included with this product! It really helps to curl my lashes to give a more wide-eyed look.</li>
    <li> Had to buy several more for the family.</li>
    <li> Yeah I now have gorgeous lashes! Take that Renee Keggy from high school.  I was soo envious of her super long,  thick eyelashes back then.  She used to trim them because they rubbed up against her eyeglasses. Haha!</li>
    <li> This is definitely something that requires a little practice, and I&#x27;ve found that applying while mascara base is still wet works better. Otherwise, this worked really well!</li>
    <li> Great service. Fast delivery. Product itself was unsatisfactory for me personally. I was hoping to achieve thicker and longer lashes but this product only somewhat elongated my lashes and separated them making them look less full than my natural look. Returned.</li>
    <li> I have short thin lashes from wearing strip lashes far to long.  The 3D fiber lashes not only thickened but lengthen my lashes looks natural and beautiful. I&#x27;ve gotten more than a few compliments, I will never wear strip lashes again!</li>
    <li> I loved it !!! Amazing</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I had eyelash extensions but developed an allergy to the adhesive. When they took the extensions off my natural lashes were trashed (note, think twice before getting extensions). I found this product and it is amazing. Adds length and volume like crazy. Easy on and off and the sellers send great tips and how tos. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have tried all the others and this one is the best.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara it is easy don&#x27;t have to use t2 or3 coats some of the fibers fall off when applying still think it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This is my first time I&#x27;ve ever used any type of fiber lashes. My very fine lashes are now long and luscious. WARNING don&#x27;t put the fiber close to your eye lid. Place by looking down and apply on the tips of your lashes this will prevent the fallout of the fibers into your eyes. Just take your time.</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be waterproof smudge proof and it is not did i get the right one?</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a great fiber mascara. I was amazed how well this one worked.. And I have tried many. It has been amazing for me..</li>
    <li> It is amazing!  If I had to change anything, it would be the shape of the gel brush.  I prefer the curved style.  This one is straight.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I use this every day now. Perfect for dramatic looks. I already have long lashes, so this makes them look like fake lashes.</li>
    <li> Really Great Product - easy and super looking!</li>
    <li> I like the way this makes my lashes look when I want to glam it up a bit!</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing ladies! You have to try it! I thought the fibers would make my lashes heavy, but no, they were soft, touchable and gorgeous! A must have for sure!</li>
    <li> First time using 3D mascara, and first time trying it out, I am amazed! This mascara is awesome!</li>
    <li> It was okay. They were a little more voluminous but nothing dramatic. I kinda wanted more but it wasn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
    <li> Even though there are three short steps per eye, it is still quicker than just using a fiber mascara and trying to get the same effect. That was taking longer and didn&#x27;t achieve the results.  This is a fun product that works!</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift and she said it was good and she loved it</li>
    <li> This mascara is great! Love the case, and the tool for brushing eyelashes! It defines my eyelashes and separates them. Giving a natural look.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this kind of product .  Since receiving it I&#x27;ve used it several times and was quite pleased with the results .&lt;br /&gt; My lashes were both polar and noticeable and look very attractive .</li>
    <li> If you want a good quality fiber mascara I would spend a little more money.  The glue is to thick and when I put the fiber on it just doesn&#x27;t look natural.  Spend more money on a different product.</li>
    <li> Just as good as Younique 3d fiber lash but cheaper! I love this product!</li>
    <li> Great product. This mascara really does add length to my existing lashes. I got asked multiple times if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes!! It does take some practice to get them just right, and you definitely only want to apply the fibers to the tips of your lashes (I learned that the hard way). You will get fibers all in your eye if you don&#x27;t. Apply multiple layers of gel and fibers for best results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great! I have thin, short lashes that are blonde at the tips, and I have never been able to apply false lashes with much success, so I was very interested in trying a product like this but also leery as I have friends that use all-in-one versions and noticed they get a lot of fiber shedding on their faces throughout the day. Wowza! This stuff almost doubles the length of my lashes along with regular mascara (I use It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara by Elizabeth Mott). I don&#x27;t think it quite achieves the same look as falsies, but that could have more to do with the density of my lashes in the first place. It does, however, make a huge difference over mascara alone. Some days I apply this stuff without any other makeup just because I love how much more feminine it makes my eyes look. I have had no problems at all with shedding or fibers getting into my eyes, and it wears easily all day without having to re-apply. I&#x27;m glad they included the eyelash brush for separating your lashes, as it definitely helps to create a more natural look. I don&#x27;t have to do anything out of the ordinary to remove it either, I just use a soapless microfiber makeup remover cloth and after a few wipes it&#x27;s gone. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I don&#x27;t have much time and this is quick and easy! It stays on even with the eye drops I have to put in four times a day. It adds just the right amount of pop to keep up with my little boys&#x27; beautiful eye lashes, but not too much to look like I am going over the top. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time as promised in good condition. This product is great! I find it&#x27;s not irritating as well. The difference in my lashes is noticeable but not too over the top. I love it!</li>
    <li> Yes, very pleased. Will buy it again. Thanks</li>
    <li> I used many fiber lash mascara but this one was worth the price plus I got it the second day I order it in a nice box plus it&#x27;s container is super cute and keeps my mascara in place. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was I accidentally tilted the transplanting gel and a lot came out. I don&#x27;t know if it is waaay too liquid or it had a lot! Lol but I got so worried I don&#x27;t want to waste it. Be careful! Do not tilt it while applying it! &amp;amp; the fiber tube when you&#x27;re ready to apply it is like you take a lot of fibers and it has nothing to prevent it to take out a lot! Becareful with that too. Those last two were my only two issues but the mascara is perfect! I do recommend it! Just be more careful than me while using this product. Ps I wish the fiber tube had something to prevent taking out a lot and the transplanting one something to prevent leakages! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I got contacted by Louise from simply and I got a replacement mascara :) their customer service is awesome! I tried to update my review but for some odd reason it didn&#x27;t got posted up. Louise tried tremendously to help me get a replacement through amazon customer service but they said they did not had the product in their stablishments. I am super happy with this purchase! I am still using the product almost every day.</li>
    <li> Love this so much I bought two more for my daughters</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, I&#x27;m glad I tried it and ordered 2 gave one to my grandaughter easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Works great I like it</li>
    <li> This does make my eyelashes look longer, but even being super careful I find it difficult to not get too much fiber on my lashes. It does smudge under my eye at the end of the day. Nice mascara, but not special as stated and I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the $32 version sold by younique if not better! I love this and will definitely order more! I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Just like the Younique product.  No problem with application and it stayed on all day.  Haven&#x27;t tested it to see how waterproof it was.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she raves about how good it is. Even the case it comes in is impressive.</li>
    <li> I have used a similar product in the past, but it was sticky and hard to remove. This product goes on with ease and stays on all day. The results  are long and full lashes .Removal is simple with warm water and some regular make-up cleanser.  Great product and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I just used it, and looks incredible!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have super little lashes and I used differents mascara to make them longer and curly some times I was very disappointed because I just made them heavier than anything but with this they look awesome!!! I really recommend this product it&#x27;s so easy to use and LOVED IT for that.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It&#x27;s better than falsies and much easier to put on. I do get complements all the time.</li>
    <li> The fibers kept falling into my eyes even after I watched the video.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Length lenght length and not messy just be careful until you get use to it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used---and I think I&#x27;ve used about 6 different lash lengtheners.</li>
    <li> I love this product-it really does make your lashes pop-so awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take an application or two to really get the hang of it, and I&#x27;m still off &amp; on with being able to apply it with little to no clumping-but since I&#x27;ve had it come out almost perfect I know that has to do mostly with my skill level-and not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks I&#x27;ve experienced are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. During application some fibers almost always fall into my sink, if I dont clean it up then, it&#x27;s a pain to get it off later since its waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You really need make-up remover to get it off at night, which I don&#x27;t normally use so it&#x27;s a bit of a pain but worth the extra hassle for the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other comment is that the fancy case it comes in seems unnecessary &amp; they could probably shave a few bucks off the price if they nixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again that&#x27;s a small issue in light of the beautiful lashes this mascara give me!</li>
    <li> Thought this product would make my sparse lashes look fuller.  It did plus longer and quite spectacular.  Much easier than trying to glues lashes on.  You can wear it every day because it doesn&#x27;t look theatrical.  Great product.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this product. Taking your time is important to avoid clumps. It seems to last all day without flaking. I do start with one coat of my regular mascara and then apply the fiber mascara. I use coconut oil as a make up remover and it does a great job of gently removing the mascara.</li>
    <li> I seriously LOVE this product and I never say that! I did get the fibers in my eyes the fist time using it. I did this by not using enough of the gel to seal it &amp; by using it to close to my eye rather then focusing on the end of lashes. Either way I love it!!!! So do my friends!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> per female friend - give more volume to lashes, but it kinda clumpy</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara, I gave it 4 stars because when I first started using it I kept getting the fibers in my eyes but now I close my eyes when and I put the fibers on and they haven&#x27;t gotten in my eye since. I would recommend this product fast shipping and everything.</li>
    <li> I use the double mascaras (the white first, black after), so I am used to having long lashes. I usually put my regular mascara on first for the day, and after work I will use the 3D Lash Mascara to reapply the look. Works perfectly. Great color and length. And it stays!</li>
    <li> Fabulous!!! Easy to use. Wonderful results!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It gives me the lashes. I have always wanted.  I tried false lashes several times and could not get use to them. With this 3D mascara I don&#x27;t even feel like I have anything on while looking glamorous at the same time.  Great product! Thank You!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews on products but the Simply 3D Fiber Lash Mascara deserves a great one! First of all, the packaging it arrived in was quaint and very nice. The gel smells good, It&#x27;s black, which I prefer over the white transplanting gels that some companies sell. The fibers did not cause me any irritation, once you apply the transplanting gel to seal the fibers in I didn&#x27;t experience any fallout. I worked out and sweat all over with this mascara on and It didn&#x27;t bleed at all, which was very impressive. I&#x27;m asian and have short, sparse lashes so I was looking all over the market for a product like this that fit all my requirements- waterproof, volumizing and lengthening. I&#x27;ve tested other Fiber Lash Mascaras in the past, but none of them really catered to all my needs. This product goes above and beyond. It doesn&#x27;t look spidery or clump my lashes together either like some mascaras do. The product was also extremely easy to remove. One of my pet peeves is when mascara takes my lashes with it, but all I needed was a little water, a cotton pad, gentle rubbing, and all of my mascara is removed! I have attached pictures of my lashes before and after ONE LAYER of the mascara- the difference is HUGE! You can also layer the mascara for even more volume/length, but I find one layer is enough for casual wear. I recommend this product to anyone looking for long, voluminous lashes. The seller was very responsive and the package came with detailed instructions and tips. Very happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara l have ever used, I&#x27;m so upset with this product. It&#x27;s messy and is nothing I expected. I expected better of this product but got worse instead.</li>
    <li> For the most part I really like this mascara. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple days now and it definitely does make my lashes look longer and thicker, more than with any other mascara I have tried. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with irritation or the fibers falling into my eyes or on my cheeks throughout the day. And it also removes pretty easily with cheap Equate oil-free makeup remover. But it does take awhile to apply, (I like to use 3 layers), if you look closely the fibers are visible which I think defies the part of the mascara looking natural, and I really wish that the mascara would hold a curl better. I have pretty stubborn straight long lashes, and despite curling them before applying they didn&#x27;t hold much of the curl. Which, because they are so long is kind of problematic for me, if I wear my glasses they rub against my glasses all day. But overall I&#x27;m impressed with the performance of this mascara and I would definitely recommend it if your current mascara isn&#x27;t quite cutting it.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have only used it once, and have never used something like this before, so I think I need to get the hang of it. But my first attempt went just fine. It didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eyes which is great.</li>
    <li> I was completely unable to apply false eyelashes. This stuff is fantastic. I love the fullness I have when I use the product. It&#x27;s easy to use, and tried and tested, is waterproof!</li>
    <li> The first fiber mascara I bought was the younique one and it was great. I bought this one because it was cheaper thinking all fiber mascara was the same, NO it is not. It worked great for about the first few uses then it just didn&#x27;t work anymore. It didn&#x27;t build my lashes up as well after a few uses, they weren&#x27;t as long and full as the first few uses, plus its harder to take off. (than younique) It tore out some of my eye lashes. I suggest spending more money to get better and longer quality. Customer service was great, they sent me emails giving advice and asking if I received my mascara but the product sucked. I make my purchases based on reviews and I don&#x27;t understand why the reviews are so great for this product unless I just received a bad mascara.</li>
    <li> WOW!  If you ever wanted to achieve the look of fake lashes without all the annoyance of actual fake lashes then this product is for you!  seriously, this stuff is AMAZING!  My lashes have never looked more long and more thick.  The application is surprisingly easy and really only takes a few minutes, but its worth the extra effort in the end!  People actually stopped me and asked me if my eyelashes were real...when does that ever happen?!?!?!?!?!?!  Just a quick FYI, I would invest in some eye makeup remover.  It does the job a little bit better than your average soap and water. This is seriously the best!</li>
    <li> I have deep set eyes with very short lashes and Simply Lash Mascara makes my lashes so long and thick that I feel like I am wearing false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other fiber mascaras and this is by far the best!! I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! It totally makes your lashes look amazing.</li>
