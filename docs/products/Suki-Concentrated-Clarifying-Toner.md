      <li>It smells nice and feels a nice refreshed feeling on the face, temporarily.</li>
      <li>Seems this combination of ingredients is what my skin needed: Vit C, lavender, chamomile, rose, calendula, aloe...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll ever be able to go on living! :)</li>
      <li>And the cleanser is nice too :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the most amazing brand of face products I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I love Suki products and have used them for over a year now.</li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>Love the fact there are peptides in this, but wish the ingredient content would be labeled on the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I love suki products.</li>
      <li>But the last two...are absolutely wonderful.  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE Suki</li>
      <li>/&gt;She then started using them and has had the same, wonderful results.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell and feel of this toner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad the glass bottle didn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>so well - love</li>
      <li>I love the smell...</li>
      <li>wonderful products, especially this toner and their exfoliating foaming cleanser.</li>
      <li>Great natural toner!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;i love the fact that the ingredients are so clean that you could eat it!</li>
      <li>It contains so many great natural ingredients, you can even tell there are no chemicals or alcohol added just by smelling it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s scent is on the strong side.  </li>
      <li>I use it throughout the day just for a quick pick me up!</li>
      <li>It made my pores huge</li>
      <li>I gave it 3 stars because if feels nice during application and, again, for the scent, and being gentle.</li>
      <li>I was really happy to see a vendor that actually cares about their customer&#x27;s experience!  </li>
      <li>As for the shipping -- I am impressed that the vendor is sending me free samples for my trouble.  </li>
      <li>The results would probably be better is he would use it consistently</li>
      <li>I bought the foaming exfoliating cleanser first and since have tried many suki products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;what&#x27;s nice is when the bottle&#x27;s empty, you&#x27;ve got a handy spritz bottle.  </li>
      <li>After reading so many positive reviews about this product, I decided to take the plunge and order.  </li>
      <li>of course, I immediately ordered the full size set of these items.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t even care how expensive it is because you can NOT put a price on keeping the skin on your face healthy and beautiful!</li>
      <li>I use this toner every single day and it makes my moisturizer sink in so much better and makes it work more effictively.</li>
      <li>I think that the balancing toner and the balancing day moisturizer are the two steps of this product that make the real difference -- with the cleanser, you&#x27;re probably fine going with something cheaper like Cetaphil if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on all 3 of the products.  </li>
      <li>This smells wonderful and really helps with a lot of issues like dryness, irritated skin and dull skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is very herbally, but light.</li>
      <li>Some worked better than others, but none of them really helped all that much.  </li>
      <li>I cannot be enthusiastic enough about this product.  </li>
      <li>My face is soft and smooth, with no redness, and the acne I had along my jawline is almost gone, in a matter of days!</li>
      <li>After moving from Southern Cali to the PNW my treatment for rosacea was no longer effective.</li>
      <li>and I smooth 3-4 pumps onto my face and make sure I keep smoothing it on and patting it in until it&#x27;s dry</li>
      <li>I tried many different things and had some good results but nothing complete and lasting like with the toner.</li>
      <li>And regarding the scent: I like it very much.</li>
      <li>They seem to be very high quality and because I am concerned about what I am putting on my skin, the cost is worth it.  </li>
      <li>first, then I spray 4-5 sprays onto a cottonball and swipe across my face to make sure I get any left over makeup residue off.</li>
      <li>but I think it may be starting to...will give it more time.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>which really makes sense, because your face includes your mouth!</li>
      <li>After continued use, followed by a moisturizer, it continues to be the toner I reach for first.  </li>
      <li>My face is clear and smooth and even toned.</li>
      <li>My skin is very pale with a lot of red and this toner is the best product I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>toner paired with the other two products I mentioned makes my skin GLOW and makes it soooooo CLEAR and CLEAN!!!</li>
      <li>Better than most other products out there that are double or even triple the price of this product.</li>
      <li>In fact, I do have one filled with witch hazel toner, which I use to calm minor skin irritations elsewhere on my body</li>
      <li>I have very oily and blemish prone skin</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Yet it is so gentle, it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes when you spray your face.</li>
      <li>This toner is very soothing and calming.</li>
      <li>then, have the appropriate serum ready to work in a drop or two of that while the toner&#x27;s still wet on your face.  </li>
      <li>Such a nice and simple step to add to any regimen.</li>
      <li>My cheeks are starting to get more sensitive</li>
      <li>I have since become a fan of many other Suki products.</li>
      <li>This gentle, natural product goes on first after washing your face.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;d highly recommend using the whole line (cleanser, toner, serum).</li>
      <li>I been using Suki for the the past 2 weeks and this skin care line is amazing.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without them now!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend all of the SukiFace products.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this for people with combination skin or oily skin.</li>
      <li>at least half the bottle left which is impressive to me considering how much I use it!</li>
      <li>It definitely has not dried me up or broken me out at all, love the light fresh scent...</li>
      <li>once you&#x27;ve dried your face after using the appropriate suki cleanser, mist your face 8-9 sprays and don&#x27;t use a cotton ball.  </li>
      <li>I have normal skin with reddish tones.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Hours later, my skin was still fresh, soft and NOT OILY!</li>
      <li>I can go all day, blotting only once or twice, with fresh, soft, non-oily skin and my makeup looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face felt clean and refreshed without being dry or tight, and lightly moisturized after using the balancing day</li>
      <li>My 16 year old son even uses them and they have done wonders on the blemishes with no irritation too!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Overall, I really like Suki products and have purchased this toner twice for myself and gave it as a gift to my mom (who likes it too).  Given this, I think it is quite clear I&#x27;m a fan!  Typically, I spray this on after I wash my face.  I also find myself spraying myself for a refresher through the day, as sometimes my skin gets oily or I just need to wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of packaging, I like the glass bottle and have saved the last few I&#x27;ve gone through and filled them with other sprays.  In fact, I do have one filled with witch hazel toner, which I use to calm minor skin irritations elsewhere on my body (I have sensitive skin).  Its formula does not irritate my skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s scent is on the strong side.  Although its scent does not bother me, I could see others who are sensitive to scents might not liking this.  My only personal vice with is its price.  I know, Suki uses high quality ingredients, which does justify the price to an extent, but I&#x27;m on the hunt to find a toner that can deliver Suki level results for less money. I may never find that, so I will continue with this toner.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but good things to say about Suki! wonderful products, especially this toner and their exfoliating foaming cleanser. This toner is very soothing and calming. It contains so many great natural ingredients, you can even tell there are no chemicals or alcohol added just by smelling it. The smell is very herbally, but light. I use this toner every single day and it makes my moisturizer sink in so much better and makes it work more effictively. Definitely will repurchase again.</li>
    <li> I am 40 years old and have a lot of trouble with acne and blemishes.  My skin is very pale with a lot of red and this toner is the best product I have ever used.  I have tried several products and this produced results within 48 hours.</li>
    <li> This review is for the entire Suki for oily skin system (Exfoliate Foaming Cleanser, Balancing Toner, Balancing Day Lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled with my extremely oily, congested &amp; blemish prone skin all of my life (I&#x27;m 44).  I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap grocery store brands, to expensive department store brands, to exclusive salon lines (both natural and conventional skin care lines) with little success.  Some worked better than others, but none of them really helped all that much.  I was still so oily an hour after cleansing and putting on my makeup that my face would be shining like a beacon and my makeup would be melting off.  I went through package after package of oil blotting tissues every day trying to stem the tide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Suki.  Even with just the little samples that I received, I could tell the difference.  My face felt clean and refreshed without being dry or tight, and lightly moisturized after using the balancing day lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours later, my skin was still fresh, soft and NOT OILY! My makeup stayed in place.  of course, I immediately ordered the full size set of these items.  They&#x27;re not cheap, but they are so worth it.  I can go all day, blotting only once or twice, with fresh, soft, non-oily skin and my makeup looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while, I can see that my skin texture is also beginning to improve.  Several enlarged oil glands on my forehead, which a dermatologist said would have to be professionally removed (which would leave scabs for a couple of weeks) and would then most likely come back later, are now diminishing by themselves.  Some have disappeared entirely and others have gotten a lot smaller and less noticeable.  And that&#x27;s after less than a week of using the Suki products.  I have had no blemishes since I started using this system daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing line of products.  I will be a devoted user for life!  If you have troubled, congested, oily skin, do yourself and favor and get the sample set of this line and give it a try.  It&#x27;s a miracle!skin, do yourself and favor and get the sample set of this line and give it a try.  It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews about this product, I decided to take the plunge and order.  This product just didn&#x27;t agree with me.  I have combination skin, which this product is formulated for as stated in the description, however, it left my skin feeling extra dry.  In addition, after using this product for a few weeks, I started to break out.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> As soon as I started using the Balancing Toner along with the rest of the system, I immediately saw an amazing difference in my skin. My skin is not oily, but not dried out either as other products have made it. My face is soft and smooth, with no redness, and the acne I had along my jawline is almost gone, in a matter of days!</li>
    <li> I bought the foaming exfoliating cleanser first and since have tried many suki products.  They seem to be very high quality and because I am concerned about what I am putting on my skin, the cost is worth it.  This toner is great!</li>
    <li> I love the smell...it seems to dry my face out though.  I have normal skin with reddish tones.  Love the fact there are peptides in this, but wish the ingredient content would be labeled on the bottle.  Also, shipping was very, very slow.  It took almost a month to get and then, they shipped it in a bubble wrapped small package, so the plastic cover was smashed off and the product was leaking.  I&#x27;m glad the glass bottle didn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m not impressed.  There are other products out there that are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/3/12  UPDATE:  I recently received an email from this vendor asking me to re-evaluate this product.  I was really happy to see a vendor that actually cares about their customer&#x27;s experience!  I have continued to use this product and do notice my skin is firmer and brighter.  After continued use, followed by a moisturizer, it continues to be the toner I reach for first.  As for the shipping -- I am impressed that the vendor is sending me free samples for my trouble.  Not many companies actually read AND FOLLOW UP on reviews of their items.  I will continue to purchase this item from this vendor.  I changed my rating due to the vendor&#x27;s concern and the fact I really do continue to use the product!</li>
    <li> I cannot be enthusiastic enough about this product.  It is absolutely amazing.  I have a long, long history of really bad acne, and I&#x27;ve basically tried everything out there.  I&#x27;ve been on numerous antibiotics, accutane, tried every form of over the counter face washes/moisturizers/toners... either they were too harsh and just made everything worse, or they would just not help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most amazing brand of face products I&#x27;ve ever used.  I received it as a gift, and I was very skeptical of something \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and natural... until two days later, my face was looking absolutely amazingly different.  My sister asked me if I had started using foundation, and I told her no, I&#x27;m just using Suki face products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She then started using them and has had the same, wonderful results.  I think that the balancing toner and the balancing day moisturizer are the two steps of this product that make the real difference -- with the cleanser, you&#x27;re probably fine going with something cheaper like Cetaphil if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on all 3 of the products.  But the last two...are absolutely wonderful.  And the cleanser is nice too :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please please buy their products!  If they go out of business from not being well publicized enough... I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll ever be able to go on living! :)</li>
    <li> Everyone in my family uses this.  It is anti-acne, anti rosacea, and anti-redness.  I use it twice a day under my moisurizer.  Yet it is so gentle, it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes when you spray your face.</li>
    <li> Great natural toner!!! The pump spray is the perfect dose! Smells great and leaves skin refreshed!! The face wash is even better!</li>
    <li> This is the only toner I&#x27;ve ever used that not only provides a terrific lift any time of day, but actually reduces acne.  The whole Suki line is terrific, and cruelty-free.  I switched from Origins, which I thought was the best.  I will cut back on groceries before I stop using Suki products.</li>
    <li> BEST toner I&#x27;ve ever bought and used.  This stuff is amazing and hydrates my skin so well - love the nice after glow.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I cleanse with the Lemongrass Cleanser first, then I spray 4-5 sprays onto a cottonball and swipe across my face to make sure I get any left over makeup residue off. After word I spray 3-4 sprays directly on my face and pat it in with my hands....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my face is still moist with this I use the Balancing Day Lotion (Formerly the Velvet Facial Cream) and I smooth 3-4 pumps onto my face and make sure I keep smoothing it on and patting it in until it&#x27;s dry (I don&#x27;t press or rub really hard, just light swipes and pats until it&#x27;s soaked into my skin) and voila!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner paired with the other two products I mentioned makes my skin GLOW and makes it soooooo CLEAR and CLEAN!!! MY acne is vanishing and any redness I&#x27;ve had on my face is nearly gone! This stuff has ingredients in it that are anti-inflammatory and help reduce redness and swelling (Which comes with acne) I LOVE LOVE LOVE Suki products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even care how expensive it is because you can NOT put a price on keeping the skin on your face healthy and beautiful! PLUS a little bit goes a LONG way with Suki! LOVE SUKI!</li>
    <li> It works! I&#x27;ve used it for a few days, about 3xday. I spray it on cotton to wipe my face focusing on the trouble rosacea red &amp; pimple areas and I also spritz it on my face afterwards and it quickly drys up. After moving from Southern Cali to the PNW my treatment for rosacea was no longer effective. I tried many different things and had some good results but nothing complete and lasting like with the toner. I noticed an almost immediate improvement the same day. Now it has been 3 days and wow! My face is clear and smooth and even toned. I have actually tried several of its ingredients individually and separately, again with just-ok results. Seems this combination of ingredients is what my skin needed: Vit C, lavender, chamomile, rose, calendula, aloe... And regarding the scent: I like it very much. It appeals to my earthy soul. Thank you! I will be ordering the other items in this line!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this toner. It goes a little quicker than I&#x27;d like, but I like the ingredients, so I&#x27;ll keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. I&#x27;m in my late twenties, and suffer from some occasional acne. This isnt oily or drying and smells good. I would recommend this line!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It soothes my skin, removes all impurities, smells great, and best of all does not dry out my skin at all. I have since become a fan of many other Suki products. I have both rosacea and oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love suki products. I have very oily and blemish prone skin and these are the only products that have helped me get my skin under control.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have if you want to acquire and or continue having even toned, glowing, flawless beautiful skin. SUKI is truly amazing!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used.  At 35, I still get cystic acne.  This is the only toner that keeps it in check, and doesn&#x27;t strip my face dry.  Natural, cruelty-free and made in the USA!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this stuff (and several other suki products) ever since my local co-op grocery started selling it a few years ago. once you&#x27;ve dried your face after using the appropriate suki cleanser, mist your face 8-9 sprays and don&#x27;t use a cotton ball.  then, have the appropriate serum ready to work in a drop or two of that while the toner&#x27;s still wet on your face.  also since it&#x27;s packaged in glass, don&#x27;t drop it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;suki is indeed expensive stuff, but i&#x27;m very satisfied. i&#x27;d highly recommend using the whole line (cleanser, toner, serum). they don&#x27;t seem to make sense without each other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what&#x27;s nice is when the bottle&#x27;s empty, you&#x27;ve got a handy spritz bottle.  i use mine for aromatherapy concoctions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love the fact that the ingredients are so clean that you could eat it! which really makes sense, because your face includes your mouth! ~ ;)</li>
    <li> I been using Suki for the the past 2 weeks and this skin care line is amazing. I was using Philosophy but it seems they changed the ingredients and my skin was not responding well and I discovered Suki and omg its amazing this is now the only thing I will use from now on</li>
    <li> I use the Suki Cleanser so I figured I would try out the toner. I really do not how to assess the product because it doesn&#x27;t really do anything. It smells nice and feels a nice refreshed feeling on the face, temporarily. I did not see any change on my skin and any affect on my face. I gave it 3 stars because if feels nice during application and, again, for the scent, and being gentle.</li>
    <li> This has helped my teenage son&#x27;s acne considerably. The results would probably be better is he would use it consistently but alas you can only lead the horse to water!</li>
    <li> My cheeks are starting to get more sensitive and I wanted a product to calm that down. I&#x27;ve only been using this a couple months..not sure it is helping, but I think it may be starting to...will give it more time. It definitely has not dried me up or broken me out at all, love the light fresh scent...I use it throughout the day just for a quick pick me up! Still have at least half the bottle left which is impressive to me considering how much I use it!</li>
    <li> I love Suki products and have used them for over a year now. My 16 year old son even uses them and they have done wonders on the blemishes with no irritation too! I highly recommend all of the SukiFace products. Can&#x27;t live without them now!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything good for my skin. It made my pores huge but I was skeptical about such an expensive product doing the opposite of what it claims but as soon as I stopped using it they went back to normal. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite toners! It sprays evenly and helps keep away the breakouts. We&#x27;ve even used it on cuts and scrapes because the white willow in it helps with pain and inflammation. Highly recommend this for people with combination skin or oily skin. I&#x27;ll sometimes use it on a cotton round rather than just spritzing it, to wipe away anything I may have missed with my cleanser - particularly if I&#x27;m wearing a foundation, or want to touch something up. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and really helps with a lot of issues like dryness, irritated skin and dull skin. Such a nice and simple step to add to any regimen.</li>
    <li> This gentle, natural product goes on first after washing your face. I follow with the Suki balancing day lotion. Great products.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!! Balanced out my skin and cleared up my pimples. Better than most other products out there that are double or even triple the price of this product.</li>
