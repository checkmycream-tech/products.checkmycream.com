      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have used this product exclusively for many years.</li>

      <li>For example, all genuine Pureology products are sold exclusively in salons or spas.</li>
      <li>This is a great product that I have used for many years due to my hair coloring.</li>
      <li>Love the large containers.</li>

      <li>this conditioner has gotten more expensive over the years, but I have yet to find another conditioner that makes my hair lay as nicely, so I&#x27;ll keep paying for it as it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
      <li>thanks all beauty&lt;br /&gt;WOW!  </li>
      <li>I understand amazon can grant sellers request to certain damaging review however.</li>
      <li>This has been my conditioner for over 8 years now, and despite being an experimental beauty junkie and having tried numerous &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;exclusive&amp;#34; conditioners, this one still delivers the most consistent results.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to get results.  </li>
      <li>You know that feeling you get in your hair when you purchase a new shampoo or conditioner for the first time</li>
      <li>This is one of the only conditioners that detangles and leaves my hair tingly clean.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;In order to protect Pureology salons and to ensure that consumers only receive the highest quality Pureology products appropriate for their specific hair needs, Pureology continues itscommitment to aggressively combat diversion:&lt;br /&gt;Exclusive product coding is used to track the movement of Pureology products.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is worth the extra cost.  </li>
      <li>Every time I try something new, it doesn&#x27;t measure up to my Pureology Hydrate.</li>
      <li>It was completely sooooo not pureology!</li>
      <li>A complete mix of fraud!</li>
      <li>and it makes your hair so soft?</li>
      <li>With this conditioner, it not only smooths out everything, but keeps my hair from getting damaged by occasional hot roller/straightener use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Pureology states on all its collateral and print material, &amp;#34;Genuine Products Guaranteed Only in Salons.&amp;#34; This means if you buy our products in a supermarket, drugstore, or any other outlet other than a salon or spa, we cannot guarantee that it is an authentic Pureology product that will perform as tested&lt;</li>
      <li>Salon professional products you find outside of a salon or spa are considered to be &amp;#34;diverted.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>

<li> ALL BEAUTY PLUS or SALON PLUS, refunded me in full after I informed her that I will be getting in touch with loreal corporation regarding her illegal activities.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of the only conditioners that detangles and leaves my hair tingly clean. It is also rated low on the EWG&#x27;s Skindeep website.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Bulk is the best way to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Pureology is the best hair product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the best love it buy it you will love it too....it makes your hair and scalp feel wonderful  ...Linda</li>
    <li> Great product shipped right on time</li>
    <li> love this product! Tried others and it they just don&#x27;t match up to pureology!</li>
    <li> Been using for years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> On September 29, 2013 I placed an order from the above seller, the item arrived on time and as expected.  I was very happy to have finally found a legitimate pureology seller. On February 24, 2014, I place another order, unfortunately the product that arrived was a nightmare! It was completely sooooo not pureology! A complete mix of fraud! When I contacted the seller&lt;br /&gt;ME:  The item I received is NOT genuine not even close to what pureology hydrate condition is supposed to feel on a hair ,smell or texture. I am contacting you to request refunds.&lt;br /&gt;SELLER :sorry to hear we sell about 100 a week its are biggest seller .. never had a problem .... yes please return and we will give u a refund on the product .. thanks all beauty&lt;br /&gt;WOW!  if she sell 100 counterfeit 1/2 gallon pureology condition @$83.99 each that&#x27;s $8,399.00 a week - $33,596 a month, $403,152.00 a year! $403,152.00 a year! Is what pureology by loreal is losing annually! She can well afford a lawyer for selling a counterfeit product and profiting in piracy! So I contacted loreal to make an initial inquiries on the product coding, pureology used product coding to track the movement of pureology product.&lt;br /&gt;It turns out my 1/2 gallon is definitely not a pureology and ALL BEAUTY PLUS or SALON PLUS is not a authorize retailer! I also inform loreal about amazon deleting and concealing my previous review of ALL BEAUTY PLUS or SALON PLUS by doing so amazon.com is participating to illegal counterfeit product and profit  piracy! I understand amazon can grant sellers request to certain damaging review however. I feel it is not right. People needs to know. ALL BEAUTY PLUS or SALON PLUS, refunded me in full after I informed her that I will be getting in touch with loreal corporation regarding her illegal activities.  The goodnews is she didn&#x27;t want her counterfeit item back, when I contacted loreal, I told them that the counterfeit item is still in my possession and they ask me if they send a pre-paid shipping label, if I&#x27;ll let them have it, I told them it will be my pleasure! I provided them the full name, address and all amazon information of the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Pureology provided this link to me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DANGERS OF DIVERTED HAIR PRODUCTS&lt;br /&gt;Diversion is when products are sold in &amp;#34;unauthorized&amp;#34; places.

    <li> this conditioner has gotten more expensive over the years, but I have yet to find another conditioner that makes my hair lay as nicely, so I&#x27;ll keep paying for it as it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner. Have used this for years!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same as what I get when I purchase at the salon</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years now.  I hope they never change the formula as it is perfect the way it is.</li>
    <li> I have used this product exclusively for many years. Every time I try something new, it doesn&#x27;t measure up to my Pureology Hydrate. Love the large containers.</li>
    <li> This has been my conditioner for over 8 years now, and despite being an experimental beauty junkie and having tried numerous &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;exclusive&amp;#34; conditioners, this one still delivers the most consistent results. Deeply penetrating moisture, not just superficial softness. Allows my hair to move, withstand brushing and heat treatments, all while maintaining a healthy sheen and minimizing frizz. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> First bought a small bottle from the salon as this stuff rocks.  I have thick, colored hair that is turning grey, the greys are wiry and unruly.  With this conditioner, it not only smooths out everything, but keeps my hair from getting damaged by occasional hot roller/straightener use.  The value of this bottle is great.  It does NOT come with the pump.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I have used for many years due to my hair coloring. It helps to protect the color. Very consistent product.</li>
    <li> I always use this conditioner.  It keeps my hair healty.  It makes it a lot easier to comb after washing also.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is worth the extra cost.  It doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to get results.  It leaves my hair silky and manageable unlike other conditioners that are either too heavy or not enough.  As with the shampoo, the fragrance is so refreshing too.</li>
    <li> You know that feeling you get in your hair when you purchase a new shampoo or conditioner for the first time and it makes your hair so soft? thats what this conditioner does every time I use it (every shower) I discovered this product a few years ago when a friend let me try some of theirs. I was too cheap to buy a bottle of my own, however after trying it I have not and will not ever buy another brand again! Please give this a try.</li>
