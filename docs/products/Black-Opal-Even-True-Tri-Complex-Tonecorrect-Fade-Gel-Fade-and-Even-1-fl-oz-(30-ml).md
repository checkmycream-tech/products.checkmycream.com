<ol>
      <li>This product is non-oily and therefore perfect for acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>and im flawless!!!</li>
      <li>I am convinced this absoulutley one of the best fade gels I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
      <li>Very good.  </li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>Lol</li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There has definately been a GREAT improvement in the clarity of my skin.</li>
      <li>As for now, my skin is doing great</li>
      <li>Lol yes it did,I could not find it</li>
      <li>Wonderful product for outstanding price.</li>
      <li>and I thought I would try it since the review was good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not just good for the face</li>
      <li>The product was good.</li>
      <li>The product is amazing.</li>
      <li>It is very light, but I don&#x27;t like that look on my face and neck.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>:) :)</li>
      <li>love this product, I&#x27;m planning on ordering another one.</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now with Amazon I can find it in just a click and at a better price.</li>
      <li>Worth the money!!</li>
      <li>Not as potent as the original.</li>
      <li>That makes Even True even better.</li>
      <li>If you are trying to do that, go for something like Caro Light, G&amp;G, L&#x27;Abidjanaise, Nadinola, Idole, etc....  </li>
      <li>I used this along with the Back Opal blemish wash and it works great.</li>
      <li>with most hydroquinone products, I did experience a reddening effect and some dryness upon the first month of using this gel.</li>
      <li>The 50% improvement I see now is good enough.</li>
      <li>After use of a full bottle, I see no results whatsoever and will not use this product again.</li>
      <li>and I have tried so many products to try to get the scars to fade, but none really work.</li>
      <li>Even True is a great drug store/over the counter skincare product for vanishing dark spots and balancing skin tone.</li>
      <li>This is a much appreciated addition to inventory of things that make my life as easy as one would like to have it.</li>
      <li>I love BO products, I used to use the old version</li>
      <li>Worth every penny</li>
      <li>For the most part I have clear skin</li>
      <li>One of my bras made an unflattering mark right underneath my armpit.</li>
      <li>Seen major results within two weeks (skipped many days).</li>
      <li>I have been using Black Opal skincare products for over 20yrs and have been pleased with most of them.</li>
      <li>but it was discontinued, but this one appears to be working just as good on my dark spots.</li>
      <li>As a user fir black opal for years, I liked the old formula better but this will do.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need as much concealer as before!</li>
      <li>These are all products I&#x27;ve personally used and have lightened from :).</li>
      <li>I wish I could give this no stars, even one star is too much!</li>
      <li>1st degree burns on my whole face: literally!</li>
      <li>As a person who depends a lot on external sources for my professional fulfillment, I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Works if used consistently and with sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I use this product and no joke I could see results after the first use.</li>
      <li>This product is a very watered down version of the original, maximum strength, dual fade complex gel, which work wonderfully and quickly...</li>
      <li>I saw results straight away.</li>
      <li>I was using it every night but think maybe it just wants me to take a break for a while.</li>
      <li>and  that is why I did not see much improvement.  </li>
      <li>The mask really does gently exfoliate revealing brighter skin.</li>
      <li>I did not buy the whole system, just the fade gel.</li>
      <li>Also, this product seems to &#x27;pill&#x27; when other products are applied over it, such as make-up and sunscreen, which limits it to nighttime use only for me.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I will purchase this product again, as I feel it is a decent product for a good price!</li>
      <li>would imagine that age spots would become much lighter with daily use of this product, since they are mostly located on the upper surface of the skin.</li>
      <li>I had so many dark scars on my face</li>
      <li>I used the previous version of this product with much better results.</li>
      <li>Speaking from a woman who has had black spots on her face for most of her life.  </li>
      <li>I tried many others and nothing beats Black Opal.</li>
      <li>I order two every month, and I have ordered several times from thus user, the items came quick and were as described.</li>
      <li>I was going to buy the older version of this serum which was discontinued by the company [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Great for pimples which are usually the cause of the dark marks in the first place.</li>
      <li>My scar did not completely disappear in two weeks, but they have definitely significantly fade in color.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this fade gel to anyone who has normal to oily skin.</li>
      <li>However this too is AMAZING to say the least.</li>
      <li>I would recommend buying this item because when I used it before it made my whole face clear</li>
      <li>Maybe a few more months</li>
      <li>I only use the black opal deluxe finishing powder in medium 03</li>
      <li>So, this one is supposed to be new and improved.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
      <li>In the past, I sometimes would have to go to 3 or more stores to find it.</li>
      <li>I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like this new product, because I really loved the other one in the short little round jar, but I like it even better.  </li>
      <li>B003YIDJFI Black Opal Advanced Dual Fade Gel 0.90 Oz.]]</li>
      <li>I have a light brown birthmark on half of my face, so ive become a fan of lightening creams during my lifetime.</li>
      <li>I have many dark spots on the border of my hairline, and some of the products that I have tried &#x27;stained&#x27; my white (I am salt and pepper)</li>
      <li>Wish the manufacture use black or amber bottle to minimize hydroquinone reacting to natural light.</li>
      <li>Awaiting on results to see if it will clear my spots.  </li>
      <li>and it is almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>The product was old..</li>
      <li>It has even the tone of my skin considerable.</li>
      <li>works good on my third bottle due to the fact that is over use it because it work.just a little will do the trick tho.</li>
      <li>This is a magic potion for us black women !!!</li>
      <li>Which is not to say it doesn&#x27;t have a slight odor-it does, but seems to dissipate quickly.</li>
      <li>Love black opal but this product is fast, sensitive enough for my skin, and doesn&#x27;t fade dark spots to white spots.</li>
      <li>I am only five days in after creating a new scar/hyper-pigmentation on my face from an epilator.</li>
      <li>I had to alternate the usage, skipping some days in order to give my skin plenty of time in between to get accustomed to the new product.</li>
      <li>Its only been 1 month and my skin is COMPLETLELY clear.</li>
      <li>The scar was so noticeable and embarrassing because it was rather large, almost midnight black and just above my lip.</li>
      <li>I have a few dark spots on my neck and after applying this for more than 6 weeks, the area around the darks spots have lightened and the dark spots are still there.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is a very watered down version of the original, maximum strength, dual fade complex gel, which work wonderfully and quickly...within seven to ten days. I used this product for three months with absolutely no results. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product. I wish I could give this no stars, even one star is too much!</li>
    <li> I saw results straight away. Great for pimples which are usually the cause of the dark marks in the first place.</li>
    <li> This version does not work as well as the previous version. I have a few dark spots on my neck and after applying this for more than 6 weeks, the area around the darks spots have lightened and the dark spots are still there. While the area around the spots that I was trying to lighten did get lighter with the previous version, the dark spots did disappear. I am not pleased with this version at all.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work sadly, I&#x27;m almost finishing the pot but nothing... Maybe a few more months but I cannot be bothered.</li>
    <li> Lol yes it did,I could not find it no where but amazon had it!! Im xstatic n thank you!!</li>
    <li> Finished the entire bottle but did not see tone correction.  May be I don&#x27;t have severe hyper pigmentation and  that is why I did not see much improvement.  Wish the manufacture use black or amber bottle to minimize hydroquinone reacting to natural light.</li>
    <li> Works if used consistently and with sunscreen. Great price. The sparkles/glitter can be annoying at first, especially if you are not interested in such nonsense; however, I got used to them and realized they&#x27;re not really noticeable.</li>
    <li> Very good.  It has even the tone of my skin considerable.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this fade gel because I was desperate to get rid of my acne scars. It does contain hydroquinone which I am NOT a fan of however I saw other skin lighteneing ingredients like licorice which I did research on.I decided to use it as a spot treatment because I didn&#x27;t want an unnatural complexion. So I applied it with a cotton swab only to my dark spots and next morning I noticed my marks were pinkish-purple(lol if u get me) it did start to fade overnight. Its week one of using this and my marks are now pink so I&#x27;d say it is fading. Will update u guys by week 2 as it does state improvement in 2 weeks!!! Stay tuned...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;There has definately been a GREAT improvement in the clarity of my skin. I don&#x27;t need as much concealer as before! I&#x27;m now using the black opal brightening scrub to help speed up the process. The mask really does gently exfoliate revealing brighter skin. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Final Update**&lt;br /&gt;Ok guys! I am convinced this absoulutley one of the best fade gels I&#x27;ve ever come across. Its only been 1 month and my skin is COMPLETLELY clear. I had to wear concealer because my marks were so bad now I only use the black opal deluxe finishing powder in medium 03 and im flawless!!! No exaggeration.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing. Seen major results within two weeks (skipped many days). I&#x27;m brownskin with purplish dark spots which are now as we speak clear. This product vanish dark spots while toning my skin. Love black opal but this product is fast, sensitive enough for my skin, and doesn&#x27;t fade dark spots to white spots.</li>
    <li> Finallyy something that is working for the shadow on my upper lip due to waxing!</li>
    <li> love this product, I&#x27;m planning on ordering another one. It does what it&#x27;s promised. Recommended by my sister-in-law. I use it at nightime.</li>
    <li> I have a light brown birthmark on half of my face, so ive become a fan of lightening creams during my lifetime. I have previously tried out some forms of creams that contain hydroquinone, but that were oily and caused breakouts. This product is non-oily and therefore perfect for acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;As with most hydroquinone products, I did experience a reddening effect and some dryness upon the first month of using this gel. I had to alternate the usage, skipping some days in order to give my skin plenty of time in between to get accustomed to the new product. As for now, my skin is doing great and I do see overall gradual fading. Since my birthmark resides in the deeper layers of the skin, I cant fully lighten it, but any improvement is beneficial. The 50% improvement I see now is good enough. (I have been using the product for 2 months now).&lt;br /&gt;I would imagine that age spots would become much lighter with daily use of this product, since they are mostly located on the upper surface of the skin. The same thing can be said for hyper-pigmentation spots. I highly recommend this fade gel to anyone who has normal to oily skin.</li>
    <li> So, this one is supposed to be new and improved. I was going to buy the older version of this serum which was discontinued by the company [[ASIN:B003YIDJFI Black Opal Advanced Dual Fade Gel 0.90 Oz.]] but, the price keeps going up on that one. This one seems to be working just as well. I did not buy the whole system, just the fade gel. I am only five days in after creating a new scar/hyper-pigmentation on my face from an epilator. The scar was so noticeable and embarrassing because it was rather large, almost midnight black and just above my lip. It has shrunk in size and it dark brown with some of my normal skin tone showing through at spots now. I can actually cover it with makeup now without it showing through like before. Black Opal solved my epilator nightmare! I will stick to cream hair removal on my face for now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lightening gel for a few weeks and have also been wearing sunscreen (spf 50) daily. My dark spots have lightened and my skin did not break out from this gel-based product. It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as some of the prescription lighteners and the various OTC products as well. Which is not to say it doesn&#x27;t have a slight odor-it does, but seems to dissipate quickly. I have many dark spots on the border of my hairline, and some of the products that I have tried &#x27;stained&#x27; my white (I am salt and pepper) hair yellow, but this has not happened (yet). I will update if this occurs.&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving this a 3-star rating because of the slight glitter/sparkle tint that they have added. It is very light, but I don&#x27;t like that look on my face and neck. Or anywhere else, either! Also, this product seems to &#x27;pill&#x27; when other products are applied over it, such as make-up and sunscreen, which limits it to nighttime use only for me.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I will purchase this product again, as I feel it is a decent product for a good price!</li>
    <li> I like this gel a lot! I had so many dark scars on my face and I have tried so many products to try to get the scars to fade, but none really work. I found this and I thought I would try it since the review was good. My scar did not completely disappear in two weeks, but they have definitely significantly fade in color. Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> This is a much appreciated addition to inventory of things that make my life as easy as one would like to have it. As a person who depends a lot on external sources for my professional fulfillment, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I brought this product to lighten some scarring on my legs. After use of a full bottle, I see no results whatsoever and will not use this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff takes forever to work. I remember the Dual Fade gel worked in about 2 weeks. I&#x27;m 2 months in with this stuff and see just a slight difference using it on the same areas I used to use the Dual Fade gel. I was using it every night but think maybe it just wants me to take a break for a while.</li>
    <li> My husband has chronic eczema, and he needs the fade gel for his skin. As a user fir black opal for years, I liked the old formula better but this will do. Has nothing to do with this user. I order two every month, and I have ordered several times from thus user, the items came quick and were as described. Will order from them again</li>
    <li> This product is very dangerous if not used as directed!!!  Only apply a very SMALL AMOUNT to your discoloration and dark marks!  DO NOT APPLY THIS TO YOUR ENTIRE FACE!!!!!  I applied this product to my entire face and, omg, I ended up with 1st degree burns on my whole face: literally! I had burns and blisters on my whoooole face :(. And this was simply from one application!  Stay away from this product if u are looking to change the color of your entire face and body. If you are trying to do that, go for something like Caro Light, G&amp;G, L&#x27;Abidjanaise, Nadinola, Idole, etc....  These are all products I&#x27;ve personally used and have lightened from :). However, you MUST EXFOLIATE for a total of 8 weeks before you even think about applying skin lightened to your skin, otherwise, none of your lighteners will work.... not one bit!!  Well, I hope my info has helped you all. Good luck! :) :) :)</li>
    <li> This product worked well for me. My skin is very sensitive so I had to use a little water on my face after applying because before I got small bumps do to irritation.</li>
    <li> works good on my third bottle due to the fact that is over use it because it work.just a little will do the trick tho.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I have been using Black Opal skincare products for over 20yrs and have been pleased with most of them. Even True is a great drug store/over the counter skincare product for vanishing dark spots and balancing skin tone. It lives up to it&#x27;s name. It works even faster with the Black Opal cleanser and fade creme. This product is a challenge to find in my area. In the past, I sometimes would have to go to 3 or more stores to find it. Now with Amazon I can find it in just a click and at a better price. That makes Even True even better.</li>
    <li> Not as potent as the original.</li>
    <li> I used the previous version of this product with much better results. The gold &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; is annoying if you&#x27;re using it on your face.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for outstanding price.</li>
    <li> This is a magic potion for us black women !!! This literally works within a week if used as directed.  I had horrible marks that I had for years that I hid with makeup and because of this product I get continuous compliments.  I still use it now and again if I have any discoloration.  Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I love BO products, I used to use the old version but it was discontinued, but this one appears to be working just as good on my dark spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Black Opal products for about 10 years now (mainly the fade gel and complexion bar). I was a little apprehensive about buying this product because I&#x27;ve only used the one in the small round bottle. However this too is AMAZING to say the least. For the most part I have clear skin but sometimes when I get a pimple it tends to leave a black mark on my face. I use this product and no joke I could see results after the first use. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week in a half now and all of the spots are almost completely gone. It&#x27;s not just good for the face I use it wherever there&#x27;s discoloration on my body. One of my bras made an unflattering mark right underneath my armpit. I&#x27;ve been using the fade gel on it and it is almost completely gone. You definitely will not be disappointed with this product. I tried many others and nothing beats Black Opal.</li>
    <li> Umm I&#x27;ve been using for about three week and no results I&#x27;ve purchased this item before and I saw results in about 4 weeks I&#x27;m just patient because this time around I have acne and sun damage so I know it&#x27;s gonna take a little longer. I would recommend buying this item because when I used it before it made my whole face clear but because I have acne issue I&#x27;m back in the situation</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Only thing that works for me.</li>
    <li> The product was old..The color was a dark brown and I know that the color is supposed to be a lighter color..so I won&#x27;t order from here again if they&#x27;re not checking the products before shipping</li>
    <li> The product was good. It seems to be doing the job.</li>
    <li> I got this gel to brightenup some dark patches on my face. Especially around my mouth and my chin area. I put on on the gel overnight, went to sleep and avoided the sun for two days (but use SPF when I go out). It seemed to have made my skin red and darker around the areas I have put it on. I am going back to my glycolic acid-retinol routine which gave me slow but steady result.</li>
    <li> I used this along with the Back Opal blemish wash and it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a short period of time, but when you use it faithfully, it will definitely show results and I&#x27;m definitely seeing them.  I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like this new product, because I really loved the other one in the short little round jar, but I like it even better.  The pump only squirts out a little bit at a time which makes it less messy!!  Kudos on this mixture.  It truly does work.  Speaking from a woman who has had black spots on her face for most of her life.  I&#x27;m now working on some chin spots and watching them slowly fade, it&#x27;s simply awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it people! Lol</li>
    <li> Like the smell.  Awaiting on results to see if it will clear my spots.  I&#x27;ll let you know hopefully in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> It only lightern the dark spot a little bit. Would not recommend.</li>
