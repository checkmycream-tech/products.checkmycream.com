    <li> This is the second time using this product  as a leave in conditioner when growing my hair back. I believe in this product and recommend this if you want help in restoring your hair back to good health.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It is getting harder and harder to find. This product makes your hair just wonderful. My hair is long and I wash it every night.

    <li> Totally retexturized my thin fragile hair. One application made it strong and thicker.  I put mine in a spray bottle which made it easier to apply. Thank God I found this stuff.</li>
    <li> LOOK AT PICTURE OF ITEMS IN MY ACCOUNT REVIEW - - SENT ME APHOGEE NOT FOLICURE AS ORDERED - - I AM NOT GOING TO BOTHER TO RETURN ITEM - - TO MUCH OF A PAIN!!&lt;br /&gt;NOT A GOOD WAY TO DO BUSINESS1&lt;br /&gt;CHRIS ADAMS</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but I felt compelled to write this one. I have suffered from traction alopecia for many years. After years of wearing extensions my hairline was pretty much non-existent. My hair on both sides of my head was smooth down to the skin bald except for a few stray fine hairs. My hairline was about 2 inches back from its normal place. That created the need to wear wigs because I had no other alternative. I have invested thousands of dollars in &#x27;for women&#x27; products and they didn&#x27;t work for me. I thought maybe I needed something stronger so I researched 5% minoxidil and thought Id give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I am ecstatic to write my days of having no alternative but to wear a wig are rapidly ending. I didn’t really see any results the first two months. After the beginning of the third month I started seeing what looked like a dark shadow on my scalp. I actually though my scalp was getting sun through my wig. . That&#x27;s how clueless I was. I still continued to use the product because I was determined to use the 3 month supply until the end before I made a judgement. I started noticing around that same time that my face was developing very fine peach fuzz like a baby’s skin but still I didn’t put 2 and 2 together.&lt;br /&gt;Since I was coming to the end of my supply I decided to try a different product so I went to the beauty supply store and a consultant recommended a product called Folicure. She said it restored her customer’s hair who were undergoing Chemo. So that sold me and I decided to give it a try.  That evening I used an ampule of the Folicure along with my regular nightly dropper of Lipogaine. In the morning I was in a state of shock. Apparently the Lipogaine has been working and the Folicure thickened the new growth. The dark shadow was hair that was just growing and the combination of the two products was magic.  I have the hairline I had when I was 7 years old. That’s over 30 years ago.  My hair is growing in so thick I am just astounded.Only my family members have seen me without my wig and they can’t believe how thick my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;Now there is a downside and that is, I have had to have my face waxed twice because the peach fuzz I mentioned earlier gets thicker. I feel like Chewbacca with this hair growing on my face. Now it’s not thick man hair, but seriously having a hairy face is not close to cool. However, until I get my hair back to its totally thick glory, I will wear a lumberjack beard if it means my hair is returning.  I’m kidding, but maybe not. Anyway, If this review helps any woman out there (or man) who has experienced the sadness of losing their hair, I hope this review helps you. God bless ;)</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Gives me volume without making my hair feel heavy.  Glad I found it on Amazon because it is discontinued now.</li>
    <li> this product is helping my hair thicken back up, I will keep using it until I get the growth I am working towards</li>
    <li> Alcohol is the first ingredient fyi.  I didn&#x27;t like this product at all.  Water consistency and not like other leave in conditioners that I prefer that don&#x27;t have alcohol.</li>
    <li> Have used this for 20 years.  Hope they don&#x27;t quit making it.  When I first started using it, after about 6 months....friends thought I had had a hair transplant.</li>
    <li> the conditioner Folicure had spill all over the bag and the receipt and label was all wet so I call right a way to the company that send it to me and they toll me that they will send me another one in about 5 days and that was very nice.</li>
    <li> I have found that all of the folicure produce work really well on my hair for deep conditioning and treatment as well as provide a great soft feeling.  The folicure for fine and thinning hair helps with my edges for growth.</li>
