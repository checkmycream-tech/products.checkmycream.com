      <li>Nice, but not what I what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the Boticario de Havana #300 body lotion.</li>
      <li>Most people have no idea what I am talking about when I explain it.  </li>
      <li>LOVE---</li>
      <li>Love this product for genetal use.</li>
      <li>There is more of the scent in the candle not the spray.  </li>
      <li>I will be buying more</li>
      <li>Most fragrances bother me &amp;amp; I love this for my hubby, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
      <li>clean and fresh...perfect for summer!</li>
      <li>I got the lotion as a gift and loved the scent so much I decided to give this a try</li>
      <li>It is fresh, clean and very appealing.</li>
      <li>This is a unisex scent, not too sweet but memorable.  </li>
      <li>It wears well and is light to the skin.</li>
      <li>It smells very fresh</li>
      <li>i like this cologne alot, it doesnt last all day on me but it stays on a good bit.</li>
      <li>I think that it should have more scent and less alcohol, but the product is good.  </li>
      <li>N to too sweet - just right.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is worth the price</li>
      <li>Like freshly showered.  </li>
      <li>More masculine than unisex.</li>
      <li>I bought the personal fragrance, paying more than Amazon has it listed for, but it was worth it.  </li>
      <li>Awesome as a little bit  of the spray and lotion lasts and lingers for a long time.</li>
      <li>my whole house to smell like this!</li>
      <li>but I think it smells more like male.</li>
      <li>and I am aware of the gentle fragrance throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Delicious long lasting down to earth crisp scent.</li>
      <li>Not cheap at all, but amazing quality and results.  </li>
      <li>I also HIGHLY recommend the lotion, bath oil, body balm, shower gel and the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
      <li>It also very original, I&#x27;ve never smelled anything remotely like this.</li>
      <li>Scent is amazing, but the poor longevity kept me from giving it a full 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Would definitely buy again, but would check the price on Amazon first!</li>
      <li>It is light, slightly floral with a bit of spice.</li>
      <li>so much I researched whether it came in a cologne, and low and behold, here it is!</li>
      <li>(didn&#x27;t see in the description online anywhere), and hoped it was perfume rather than EDT since EDT generally does not last on me.</li>

<li> I can&#x27;t find anywhere on the bottle if it is a eau de toilet, but I suspect it is.  </li>
<li> Previous perfumes I have liked have disappointingly evaporated within a short time.  </li>
<li> It lasts a long long time, longer than any designer perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn!</li>
<li> My only complaint about it is that, for me, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way without being overpowering.  </li>
<li> I do like wearing this for less formal occasions.</li>
<li> Smells nothing like the amazing reed diffusers, this scent is awful... smells like rotting orange zest.</li>
<li> the item arrived as seen, it had no cap, I found that weird.</li>
<li> It drives my husband crazy!</li>
<li> And he has hated every perfume I&#x27;ve tried over the years</li>
<li> Very disappointed!!!</li>
<li> The fragrance came with no box, not even a cap and smelled terrible.</li>
<li> Concerned about ordering through Amazon if the companies they use are so terrible!!</li>

    <li> My daughter received the body lotion as a gift and we loved the smell.  I went to the store where the gift was purchased and sampled all their products they had in stock.  I bought the personal fragrance, paying more than Amazon has it listed for, but it was worth it.  A little goes a long way without being overpowering.  It smells very fresh and I am aware of the gentle fragrance throughout the day.  Previous perfumes I have liked have disappointingly evaporated within a short time.  Would definitely buy again, but would check the price on Amazon first!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent..clean and fresh...perfect for summer!</li>
    <li> I love it!  Will order another. N to too sweet - just right.</li>

My only complaint about it is that, for me, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I can&#x27;t find anywhere on the bottle if it is a eau de toilet, but I suspect it is.  I took a chance on it when ordering it (didn&#x27;t see in the description online anywhere), and hoped it was perfume rather than EDT since EDT generally does not last on me.</li>
    <li> Love this product for genetal use.</li>
    <li> This has a wonderful smokey scent to.  Sometimes you can smell the lemon.  It is fresh, clean and very appealing.</li>
    <li> The fragrance came with no box, not even a cap and smelled terrible. Contacted Amazon and company contacted me - they wanted pictures, which I sent and then nothing. Concerned about ordering through Amazon if the companies they use are so terrible!! Very disappointed!!! DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!</li>
    <li> Most fragrances bother me &amp;amp; I love this for my hubby, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME!!! I get compliments on this EVERY time! I got the lotion as a gift and loved the scent so much I decided to give this a try and it&#x27;s become my signature scent and is the only perfume I wear. I also have allergies, and this does not bother my allergies or my eyes at all. Not saying that w/be the case for everyone but doesn&#x27;t irritate mine. It lasts a long long time, longer than any designer perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn! It also very original, I&#x27;ve never smelled anything remotely like this. It drives my husband crazy! And he has hated every perfume I&#x27;ve tried over the years, the price is unbeatable on Amazon also! Do not hesitate to purchase this! I also HIGHLY recommend the lotion, bath oil, body balm, shower gel and the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances a man can get ! Very refreshing with emphasis on the citrus side ! You feel very clean with something like this !! Love it !! :0)</li>
    <li> Delicious long lasting down to earth crisp scent.</li>
    <li> The smell doesnt last long at all.</li>
    <li> Ok. Great shipping... just doesn&#x27;t smell like the candle.... which is why I ordered it. Nice, but not what I what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the Boticario de Havana #300 body lotion. It wears well and is light to the skin. Now I layer it with the similar scent of this fragrance. It is light, slightly floral with a bit of spice. Awesome as a little bit  of the spray and lotion lasts and lingers for a long time. Great combo!</li>
    <li> this is a unisex fragrance but I think it smells more like male. the item arrived as seen, it had no cap, I found that weird.</li>
    <li> This fragrance always solicits amazing questions about what I am wearing.  Most people have no idea what I am talking about when I explain it.  I then go not to talk about all the related products.  Anyone I know who has come into contact with any of the products in this line are hooked. Not cheap at all, but amazing quality and results.  Get all their products....</li>
    <li> LOVE--- I will be buying more --Want my whole house to smell like this!</li>
    <li> This is a good cologne but it doesn&#x27;t have quite the scent that it should.  I ordered Havana because I have the candles of the same scent.  There is more of the scent in the candle not the spray.  I think that it should have more scent and less alcohol, but the product is good.  I don&#x27;t know if it is worth the price so I can&#x27;t say I will ever order this again but it is nice.</li>
    <li> Scent is amazing, but the poor longevity kept me from giving it a full 5 stars.</li>
    <li> A great light scent for summer.  Although it is marketed as a unisex cologne, my wife has given me 100 percent ownership.  I do like wearing this for less formal occasions.</li>
    <li> Scent is not the same as room diffuser, which is a shame.  More masculine than unisex.</li>
