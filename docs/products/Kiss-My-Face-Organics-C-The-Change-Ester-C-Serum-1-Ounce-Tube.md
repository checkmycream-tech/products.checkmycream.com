      <li>it feels great on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Great product, and</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells great (people complimented me on how I smelled when I hugged or greeted them, assuming I was wearing a citrus fragrance)...</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice film layer of moisture on your skin and dries without feeling sticky!  </li>
      <li>but this is a really good product.</li>
      <li>It smells good, it works well</li>
      <li>The moisturizer alone was really good, but I did not see any difference until I started using the serum.  </li>
      <li>You’ll love your skin again!</li>
      <li>Has a nice citrus smell too.</li>
      <li>Liked it and would buy again.</li>
      <li>It smells great and is super lightweight.</li>
      <li>It is very light</li>
      <li>In the grand scheme of face products, although it can be pricey, it is nothing compared to what you CAN pay so</li>
      <li>I love this serum.</li>
      <li>This serum is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>love Kiss My Face.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>My skin is healthy looking and my pores have shrunk.</li>
      <li>I had to purchase more.</li>
      <li>I really love it</li>
      <li>love the way it feels on my face</li>
      <li>Both products feel good, smell good and are totally non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>It smells really nice and fresh; it&#x27;s light and refreshing on the skin.  </li>
      <li>My Face products and see what&#x27;s available.</li>
      <li>but that would not be true.  </li>
      <li>The first batch I got through Amazon was fine.  </li>
      <li>It smells great, like fruit loops, but the smell fades quickly if it&#x27;s not something you fancy.  </li>
      <li>This product has a nice feel when initially applied</li>
      <li>and I am quite sure it helped reverse an early onset of two horizontal wrinkles between my eyes.  </li>
      <li>You have your face all your life, it&#x27;s worth taking care of it.</li>
      <li>A very reasonable price for C-Ester serum -</li>

      <li>it does make a positive difference.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s OK not a wow product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve learned this from DermTV and other reputable dermatologists, that C-Ester serum absorbs 100 times better than just regular vitament C serum.</li>
      <li>I think it works really well and does everything it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>My Face Organic Under Age Ultra Moisturizer really makes a difference.  </li>
      <li>Give the whole line a look over.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I have used so many different products on my 60 something year old face and nothing has worked as well as this.  </li>
      <li>Also, this doesn&#x27;t make me break out (which most other products do -</li>
      <li>So now, as I&#x27;m finding more areas that need some help, I will check out the other Kiss</li>
      <li>I have tried highly advertised and well rated products that did nothing for me.  </li>
      <li>Have been using it for a month and must say that it performs as well as the product that cost nearly 4 times as much.</li>
      <li>Now the skin has returned to its normal color and the lines are almost completely gone.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You will notice a certain glow to your skin the next morning if you use this at night under your night cream.</li>
      <li>and I like using natural serum on my face.</li>
      <li>the puffy skin under my eyes was back to normal!  </li>
      <li>I saw the wrinkles fill in with very white skin which looked new, like it had somehow been stimulated to fix itself.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive, combination and overall fussy skin).</li>
      <li>My face looks smoother, a little less wrinkly, the pores seem smaller and the tone is more even.  </li>

    <li> Works well to reduce wrinkles and plump up the skin</li>
    <li> Like it a lot.  Skin seems brighter and dark spots starting to fade.  Has a nice citrus smell too. Will order again. I thought I was getting one tube,  actually got three.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about six years now.  I really love it and I am quite sure it helped reverse an early onset of two horizontal wrinkles between my eyes.  When I started using this I saw the wrinkles fill in with very white skin which looked new, like it had somehow been stimulated to fix itself.  Now the skin has returned to its normal color and the lines are almost completely gone.  I have tried other C and Ester C products and always come back to this one.  It smells great, like fruit loops, but the smell fades quickly if it&#x27;s not something you fancy.  It is very light so it won&#x27;t weigh down your face lotion or makeup.  In the grand scheme of face products, although it can be pricey, it is nothing compared to what you CAN pay so give it a try.  You have your face all your life, it&#x27;s worth taking care of it.</li>
    <li> I am afraid I am going to sound like a TV infomercial but this is a really good product. I have used so many different products on my 60 something year old face and nothing has worked as well as this.  My skin has a tendency to look a little like alligator skin and this product in conjunction with Kiss My Face Organic Under Age Ultra Moisturizer really makes a difference.  My face looks smoother, a little less wrinkly, the pores seem smaller and the tone is more even.  I have been using the two products for a month but started to see results after a few days.  The moisturizer alone was really good, but I did not see any difference until I started using the serum.  Both products feel good, smell good and are totally non-greasy.  I have tried highly advertised and well rated products that did nothing for me.  I wish I could say I look 20 years younger but that would not be true.  I can say that it is the best product for me that I have used and it does make a positive difference.</li>
    <li> I used this every night.  Great product, and it feels great on my skin.  Dont have any complains for it.</li>
    <li> The smell is not pleasing to me.  I can&#x27;t say I used it long enough to see if it works.</li>
    <li> Obvious benefits of Vitamin C aside, here&#x27;s what I thought about the serum itself...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too sticky to put on under make up (it actually makes makeup roll into these little particles and rub off when you put this on under foundation and are attempting to rub in foundation)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great (people complimented me on how I smelled when I hugged or greeted them, assuming I was wearing a citrus fragrance)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it religiously since the summer (about 6 months) and no noticeable change.  I basically just like how it smells and I like what I *like to* think it&#x27;s doing for my skin at the cellular level... lol.. time will tell!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time.  Both by purchasing it at a local story and from Amazon.com.  The first batch I got through Amazon was fine.  Smelled the same, looked the same and the box was identical (writing on the inside).  This batch from another supplier looks suspect as it does not look nor smell the same and no writing/printing inside of the box.  You can see from past purchases where I received the previous order from and also the Under Age Ultra Moisturizer were from a different supplier than this order.</li>
    <li> love the way it feels on my face</li>
    <li> This product has a nice feel when initially applied and I like using natural serum on my face. However, this leaves an extremely sticky residue on my face afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  A very reasonable price for C-Ester serum - especially since the ESTER is what you need in a c serum, otherwise you&#x27;re wasting your money.  I&#x27;ve learned this from DermTV and other reputable dermatologists, that C-Ester serum absorbs 100 times better than just regular vitament C serum.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I had been using Derma E&#x27;s version of this for a couple of years but I cannot find it anymore so I decided to try this. It smells good, it works well and it is all natural and cruelty free. Not tested on animals, no animal ingredients and vegan friendly.&lt;br /&gt;You will notice a certain glow to your skin the next morning if you use this at night under your night cream. You only need to use a small bit, it goes a long way and soaks in quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I love Kiss My Face.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after seeing it online from Oprah. I tried and could not belive it, the results were a pleasant surprise! I had to purchase more. I use this product with the &amp;#34;Clinique Dark Spot Corrector&amp;#34;. I The results are wonderful. My skin is healthy looking and my pores have shrunk. I would definitely recommend this product. You’ll love your skin again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup and have never had problems with my skin.  The way my face looked never really bothered me.  Until I entered my 50s, that is .... A few months ago I started noticing bags and puffy skin underneath my eyes.  Ugh! Weird and so unhealthy-looking.  I stumbled across a review for this Kiss My Face product and impulsively decided to try it -- something I don&#x27;t usually do (buy products I&#x27;ve never even heard of based solely on reviews; in fact, I never really bought products, other than moisturizers -- to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; my face -- but the 50s seem to be changing that :-/ ).  I started using this Ester C serum and WITHIN DAYS (!!) the puffy skin under my eyes was back to normal!  I was amazed and delighted!! This product is awesome. So now, as I&#x27;m finding more areas that need some help, I will check out the other Kiss My Face products and see what&#x27;s available. The great job that Ester C Serum did on my eyes was close to miraculous -- I&#x27;m sold. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Finally a face serum that does not cause breakouts.  I am always happy with Kiss My Face products. Give the whole line a look over.</li>
    <li> I swear by this product and apply it to my face every night.  It smells great and is super lightweight.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this stuff is awesome!  I tried it and now would not stop using it!  It leaves a nice film layer of moisture on your skin and dries without feeling sticky!  works great for me!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a replacement for my current C-serum and came across Kiss My Face. Have been using it for a month and must say that it performs as well as the product that cost nearly 4 times as much. Great value.</li>
    <li> Liked it and would buy again. I think it works really well and does everything it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s OK not a wow product.</li>
    <li> This serum is fantastic!  It smells really nice and fresh; it&#x27;s light and refreshing on the skin.  Also, this doesn&#x27;t make me break out (which most other products do - I have sensitive, combination and overall fussy skin).</li>
