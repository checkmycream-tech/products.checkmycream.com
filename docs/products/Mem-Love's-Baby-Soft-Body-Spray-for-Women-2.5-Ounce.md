    <li> I placed this order for my wife and it arrived earlier than promised and was exactly as advertised. I would recommend this supplier.</li>
    <li> Smells just like I remembered it. It doesn&#x27;t last a really long time, maybe half a day. The scent is light and delicate and great for the Summer.</li>
    <li> Perfect light scent for our lil granddaughter and her room. She&#x27;s 20 mos.... And she likes her mommies pretties!!</li>
    <li> Great to deal with. Love it !</li>
    <li> So so very happy to finally have found this long lost favorite.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for my daughters birthday on the 25th and I sure she will love it.</li>
    <li> Smells like baby powder. Does not last long. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> My 7 yo granddaughter LOVES it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE loves baby soft perfume.  I can only get this a Walmart during Xmas season.  And having to stock up on it is nuts.  Now I can order a BIGGER bottle any time.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne! Reminds me of when I was a young college student.</li>
    <li> Just like I remember, very feminine, soft and beautiful. This is more of a cologne than a body spray.</li>
    <li> I just love the scent.  It makes a great Body Spray for after showering because it smells like baby powder.</li>
    <li> i have loved this product, since it first came out, now I&#x27;m buying it for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it never changes...makes everything smell like baby. I love it. All the kids get a spritz on their way out the door!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this all the time and are unable to get in the stores. She was happy she found it.</li>
    <li> The perfume didn&#x27;t come in a bottle, but bubble wrap. It has a really strong alcohol/offensive something-or-other, but it fades off eventually, leaving a baby powder-ish scent.</li>
    <li> This item comes in a jiffy bag and no box.  Why would you package using the glass in China when we have glass factories here.&lt;br /&gt;It was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like I remember..</li>
    <li> I love it it came in about three days at standered free shipping and it was early and I love it it&#x27;s amazing it fades a little but not much it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Just as I remembered it to be . I&#x27;m glad I could finally find it again. I love the powdery scent. One of the few perfumes I can use that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my allergies and give me a headache. If you are looking for a scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering this is the one.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it! Can&#x27;t find in retail stores except during the holidays. We&#x27;ll be back again!</li>
