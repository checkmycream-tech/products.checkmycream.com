      <li>This Boraxo is the best product she has found for cleaning aircraft sealer off her skin.  </li>

      <li>Presto, perfect soap dispenser.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great!  </li>
      <li>The best there is period.</li>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>This works perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Best hand cleaner ever!</li>
      <li>It still works great and does an excellent job.</li>
      <li>Great price on a great product.</li>
      <li>It was great to remove the grime and grease from handling steel.</li>
      <li>All in all, a great purchase.</li>
      <li>Always and forever love this soap!!</li>
      <li>The soap can scrape up any grime and makes my hands smell really good.</li>
      <li>and I had forgotten just how good this stuff was.  </li>
      <li>Just love the smell and does a great job cleaning.</li>
      <li>Boraxo works great and is super affordable.</li>
      <li>gone to get good clean hands.</li>
      <li>My crew I work with are always using it and love it also.</li>
      <li>Of course, it&#x27;s also great for men (and women) when you really need to get the dirt off after working in the yard or around the house.</li>
      <li>This for me is hands down the best hand soap ever made.</li>
      <li>This item was fine.  </li>
      <li>Gets your hands really clean.  </li>
      <li>It is powerful, and yet it is easy on the hands and does not screw up the drain like some cleaners do.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been around forever, the same exact hand cleaner I used 35 years ago, and its still the absolute best, hands down(pun intended) use a goop type to get grease, gas, or sharpie or paint, use Boraxo to finish and for everything else.</li>
      <li>Then follow up with Boraxo for that super clean look with out the greasy feel.</li>
      <li>Boraxo is a surprisingly good facial scrub.</li>
      <li>One more thing: Both orders came in so fast</li>
      <li>It cleans your hands pretty well from dirt and light grease and oil.</li>
      <li>and it was the best thing going for taking off the old black grease that was used on the grain harvesters.  </li>
      <li>That alone proves to them that it must be toxic.</li>
      <li>but their price is easily 4x higher.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like Chinese medicine, where you eat an animal&#x27;s foot to make your feet walk better.</li>
      <li>The first use.</li>
      <li>I bought it from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it in local stores any more.</li>
      <li>Huge 5-pound box is a good buy compared to buying the little containers locally.</li>
      <li>but if you need something to get oily, dirty, grime off your hands, this is the very best.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t see this very often in the store anymore</li>
      <li>so I won&#x27;t have to do without it in case it might not be available in the future.</li>
      <li>If you do get this industrial size then you&#x27;ll need to get something like a large shaker like you see in old diners that has either parmasian cheese or red pepper flakes to use it easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure where they get all these powdered hands, and how they dry and powder them, but your hands feel great afterwards.</li>
      <li>Used in lots of high end</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I find that the grit is just right, not to course and just abrasive enough.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin so soft and silky feeling!</li>
      <li>My kids won&#x27;t go near the stuff because it&#x27;s decades old.</li>
      <li>I did not find it the first place I went but found it at a local true value for the same price as online minus the shipping cost.</li>
      <li>Times have changed, and that grease is no longer used, but a good hand cleaner is still appreciated after doing dirty jobs</li>
      <li>box, so I took and empty, plastic peanut butter jar, washed and dried it, drilled holes in the screw-on cap and filled it with the powder.</li>
      <li>I sometimes use it 3 or 4 times a day and it does not dry my hands out.</li>
      <li>it is mixed with a whole bunch of other things, the box that I actually received was a different color</li>

    <li> This was ordered for my sister.  She works in an aircraft company.  The sealer that they use on the planes makes her hands very bad looking.  This Boraxo is the best product she has found for cleaning aircraft sealer off her skin.  She recommends this product to everybody with dirty jobs.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find Boraxo locally anymore, so I found this on Amazon. Huge 5-pound box is a good buy compared to buying the little containers locally. It&#x27;s gonna last a while so I had to put it in an airtight container so it wouldn&#x27;t turn into a brick from moisture.   I&#x27;ve used a lot of different hand cleaners (16 years auto mechanic) and there are a few that outperformed Boraxo by a bit but their price is easily 4x higher. Boraxo works great and is super affordable.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations of the hand soap and is like the one that I used to purchase in the stores</li>
    <li> This for me is hands down the best hand soap ever made. My hands get FILTHY with all types of dirt and grease daily and this soap gets them clean. I find that the grit is just right, not to course and just abrasive enough. I sometimes use it 3 or 4 times a day and it does not dry my hands out. My crew I work with are always using it and love it also. FOR ME THIS IS THE DEST HAND SOAP I HAVE EVER USED.</li>
    <li> This soap works like it always has.  I bought it from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it in local stores any more.</li>
    <li> I usually have alot of messy projects going on and the typical liquid soap just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore, so i finally broke down and bought this soap. I dreaded the grammar school memories of powdered soap but after using this stuff for i awhile, im having a hard time figuring out why i didnt get it sooner. It has no problem cutting through oils or paints, and now i dont have to mix my regular hand soap with a harsh chemical cleaner like goo gone to get good clean hands.</li>
    <li> Gets your hands really clean.  Need a dispenser to use.  Used in lots of high end \\&quot;authentic\\&quot; restaurants.</li>
    <li> I got this soap because I work as a ranch hand and get a lot of animal s*** on my hands.The soap can scrape up any grime and makes my hands smell really good. I guarantee it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is wonderfully old-school soap. It works well, especially for grease and such. It&#x27;s impractical to use it out of its 5 lb. box, so I took and empty, plastic peanut butter jar, washed and dried it, drilled holes in the screw-on cap and filled it with the powder. No danger in mistaking the contents either as I placed a Boraxo sign on the outside. Presto, perfect soap dispenser. My kids won&#x27;t go near the stuff because it&#x27;s decades old. That alone proves to them that it must be toxic. In an attempt to satisfy them regarding its safety, I did some research and there&#x27;s nothing toxic about it. I also learned that some people, women I suppose, use it as a sort of skin softener on elbows and the like. My kids don&#x27;t like the grainy texture to it, but that&#x27;s partly why it works so well. Great price on a great product. I avoided shipping costs by buying two boxes. The net cost was the same as buying one and paying shipping. I sent the second box to one of siblings.</li>
    <li> My secret will now be out to women (and men)... I&#x27;ve been using this for years as an exfoliating scrub (just mix with water) - all over AND for my face. It makes your skin so soft and silky feeling! Of course, it&#x27;s also great for men (and women) when you really need to get the dirt off after working in the yard or around the house.</li>
    <li> We used Boraxo on our ranch when I was a youngster and it was the best thing going for taking off the old black grease that was used on the grain harvesters.  Times have changed, and that grease is no longer used, but a good hand cleaner is still appreciated after doing dirty jobs and I had forgotten just how good this stuff was.  It is powerful, and yet it is easy on the hands and does not screw up the drain like some cleaners do.  This is my second order, and though a big box like this will last a long time, I bought extra so I won&#x27;t have to do without it in case it might not be available in the future. One more thing: Both orders came in so fast I could hardly believe it.  All in all, a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Best hand cleaner ever!</li>
    <li> I ordered the product because I had previously purchased Borax for hand cleaning when I worked in a welding shop. It was great to remove the grime and grease from handling steel. Now that I am retired I decided to get some so that I could use it when working in my gardens. It still works great and does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> This powdered type hand soap is an alternative to the liquid type if you chose. you will need water to get the soap to liquify though, to desolve the soap, but it does not have harsh chemicals like other hand soaps do.It cleans your hands pretty well from dirt and light grease and oil. You can purchased a dispenser for not to waste the product.And the five pound box should last a while when using the dispenser.I do recommend this product and amazon, you want be sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every type of hand cleaner over the years, sometimes you need a specific type of cleaner for a specific type of mess, now enters Boraxo. It&#x27;s been around forever, the same exact hand cleaner I used 35 years ago, and its still the absolute best, hands down(pun intended) use a goop type to get grease, gas, or sharpie or paint, use Boraxo to finish and for everything else. In the shop, on my jobsites, this is my entire crews go to hand cleaner. 35 years off being impressed with this product</li>
    <li> This item was fine.  On a different account at Christmas we ordered Lord of the Rings for $100.  Turns out it was from the UK and useless in the USA because of coding.  Nothing could be done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure where they get all these powdered hands, and how they dry and powder them, but your hands feel great afterwards. It&#x27;s like Chinese medicine, where you eat an animal&#x27;s foot to make your feet walk better.</li>
    <li> Just love the smell and does a great job cleaning.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!  Only a small portion does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;I think I will order a dispenser for my washroom!</li>
    <li> The best there is period.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Always and forever love this soap!!</li>
    <li> This works perfect for me. I use cream type cleaner for the heavy dirt, wipe it off. Then follow up with Boraxo for that super clean look with out the greasy feel.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t see this very often in the store anymore but if you need something to get oily, dirty, grime off your hands, this is the very best.  It&#x27;s Lava on steroids.  If you do get this industrial size then you&#x27;ll need to get something like a large shaker like you see in old diners that has either parmasian cheese or red pepper flakes to use it easily.  Get at the Dollar Store.</li>
    <li> this stuff is not pure borax it is mixed with a whole bunch of other things, the box that I actually received was a different color and it is chapter and easier to just buy at the hardware store. I did not find it the first place I went but found it at a local true value for the same price as online minus the shipping cost.</li>
    <li> Boraxo is a surprisingly good facial scrub. It cleans without overdrying, and refines the pores. Visibly. The first use. I&#x27;m not kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great; I wish they would keep making it!</li>
