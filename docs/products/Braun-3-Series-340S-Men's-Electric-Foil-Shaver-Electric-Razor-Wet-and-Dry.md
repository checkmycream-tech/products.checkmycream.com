<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nothing beats an actual razor blade for a close shave, but this is pretty good for the occasional, sort-of-reasonably-close shave.  I like that it can get completely wet.  And the sideburn feature works very well.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. I like and gladly recommend this electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other brands of rotary shavers and they all scratched my neck skin since I have a sensitive skin! So I started using razors 7 years ago and I&#x27;ve been almost comfortable with them. However, I could not shave everyday due to the same problem, SENSITIVE SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;last month I saw this offer and after some research I realized that foil shavers give better results for sensitives skins. I got this one for less than 50 and since I started using I&#x27;ve had no rash or scar on my neck or face and guess what!...I shave everyday. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> This works great. I&#x27;m a wet shaver, but for quick clean ups this thing is awesome. I charged it when I got it a few weeks ago and have used it at least 8 times without needing to recharge.</li>
    <li> I guess I like it very much</li>
    <li> Keeps my face nice and smooth I absolutely love this shaver.</li>
    <li> The shaver works well!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new electric razor and was very happy with my purchase. Great on sensitive skin and for the price, love it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> First electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Not sure if my beard is too thick or grows in too many directions, but I had a hell of a time getting a close shave with this.  It was possible, but it took for ever and my neck was in pain at the end of it.</li>
    <li> nice,but it is not the cheapest in the history</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! He says it&#x27;s the closest shave he&#x27;s gotten from an electric razor. Glad it was a success!</li>
    <li> Recommended , the best is really good.</li>
    <li> Its vibration feels very powerful in hands, and it&#x27;s much more efficient than my previous shaver!</li>
    <li> Received in good condition n  like it very much 😊👍👍</li>
    <li> Excellent battery and cut.</li>
    <li> It is the best non blade razor I have ever used.  It is not a blade, and not as close as a blade. I use it when I am in a hurry.</li>
    <li> it misses n the corner of the base of your neck, doesnt completely get all the hair.</li>
    <li> Husband is happy. Said it works well for a speedy 20 second shave. But not to wait more than every other day otherwise shaving is faster. It is less irritating to his skin which was the original purpose.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present for my husband and he loves it.  He has given up using razors all together because he finally is getting a close shave with an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor, but surprisingly its smaller and less expensive battery only model gives a somewhat closer shave.  My beard was asking for a change in the way I cut it so I shifted back to an electric.  I had a Nerelco that did a reasonable job, but I wanted a screen shaver.  The price on this model was so good I went for it.  I&#x27;m not disappointed, but I&#x27;ll keep the battery only model I&#x27;ve had for years as a back up for those occasions when I really want a close shave.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver for the price. I&#x27;ve had other Braun and Norelco shavers before. The Braun units just seem to work better for my face.</li>
    <li> does not shave clean is beard has a 2 day growth</li>
    <li> most of time you need to shave 3 time around for completely clean</li>
    <li> great rzr.. I&#x27;m going to buy this style going forward.. and half the cost of my 3d whatever rzr.</li>
    <li> This shaver works great for the price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> works 100 times better than my old Norelco triple head. I shave every 2-3 days. provides a much smoother shave than any of my previous razors.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver for the price.  I should have bought a replacement head while I was at it.  Just wasn&#x27;t thinking!!</li>
    <li> i bought it for my friend...</li>
    <li> The shaver does a decent job, but it does miss spots. With very coarse hair a razor is necessary for prep before using the Braun.</li>
    <li> The razor has worked great. There are many more expensive models but I cant see them working much better than this one. I am well pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily as a travel shaver, after I converted from electric to blade after 40 years of electric shaving.  Largely from the glowing reviews this shaver received here on Amazon.  Thing is I get a faster and equally close, if not closer shave using my disposable Panasonic ES3831K electric shaver that is kept  in my car&#x27;s glove box.  Now when I travel, I usually travel with the Panasonic which I use morning and evening.  If  I miss one of those, then I typically shave with a blade, because the blade handles longer beards better than electric shavers.  I keep the Braun at home when I want to shave intra-day for touch-up, and even then I often skip the Braun if I&#x27;ll be driving, and then get the Panasonic out after getting in the car.</li>
    <li> is not really a close shave. have to press  on my skin hard to get the shaver to cut wiskers on skin</li>
    <li> Coming from a Remington shaver, I&#x27;m not very happy with this one. While the price is reasonable, if your facial hair grows fast, and is thick, I find that this shaver just does not do the job. I often have to go over parts of my face several times to get even a remotely good shave, which causes irritation. It is not because the blade is dull, since I just got this shaver. I would recommend looking at others such as http://www.amazon.com/Remington-R4-5150A-Titanium-Rotatry-Technology/dp/B007GZ72X0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1429274038&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;remington+shaver which is less money, and in my opinion gives a better shave.</li>
    <li> Great shave at a great price.  Wet -dry is the only way to go.  I use this razor with shaving cream for a very close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor and after watching reviews and doing research, this is the winner in my book. I used it twice and it gets closer than my andis barber clippers do. It has some weight to it, has a great build, and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3July2013&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and I can say with cofidence that it&#x27;s not that great. It leave hairs on the neck just like other reviewers say. It skips patches of hairs most of the time and I don&#x27;t notice till i get to work smh. It does very well on the face though I must admit, but when it comes to the overall picture it&#x27;s 2 stars on the neck and 5 stars on the face which equates to 3 total stars. I should&#x27;ve saved for a 200 dollar shaver.</li>
    <li> This was among the worst products I have ever bought. Lets cut to the chase on why, it fails to do its job. It cant remove any hair on my face wet or dry. I have even read the Manuel to make sure I was using the product correctly which I was. Don&#x27;t Buy the product because you will just end up returning it like I did after having the product for 6 hours.</li>
    <li> Belongs to son, he&#x27;s pleased</li>
    <li> This shaver works pretty well for an electric shaver. It comes close to a blade shave but not quite; although I was not expecting it to be as close as the real thing anyways. I have to shave every day so i do one day with my blade and the next day with this and its fine. I have not had to replace anything on it yet and I have used it Dry and Wet as well. Keep in mind that it seems to do better in the wet as opposed to dry but then is not as quick as you would like since you need to use shaving cream and such. Comes with lube for the blades and you are supposed to replace the blade cartridge every 18 months. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Really awesome shaver, always shaves really close and doesn&#x27;t tug.</li>
    <li> It does not shave close enough for me.  It always feel like I missed a spot (especially in the neck area) no matter how careful and long I shave.  I tried using it both wet and dry... it does seem to shave a little closer in the wet mode. However, I was just expecting a closer shave after all the research I did on Braun Series 3-340s Shavers.</li>
    <li> it can&#x27;t shave the beard in the shortest time</li>
    <li> just soso. not as good as i imagined</li>
    <li> Think is the lowest, the result has been the price, very disappointed</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. I always buy Braun because they are the best. I had a series 1 for almost 5 years. The series 3 is amazing! Smooth shave every time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my college bound nephew for Christmas. He reported back that he really likes it. I have a thick beard growth and I have used Braun razors since I was in college also. Takes some time to figure out how to consistently get a clean shave, but once you do, it&#x27;s magic.</li>
    <li> it hurts the first time you use, but when you find a proper way to use it, it will be better.</li>
    <li> This shaver is honestly very mediocre.  It does a poor job for me.  I am an African American and I have short curly facial hair.  From the first shave in order to get it to cut close enough I have to press it deeply into my skin.  This is both wet and dry shaving.  I have read online that replacement blades are actually better than the ones that are shipped with the shaver so I will be trying those to see if it helps.  I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> only used it once, and it worked fine. I will know more on a later date.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver and impervious to water. After you use it just remove the foil shave head and wash it out under warm water. I keep it charged all the time by perching it on its charger, but I think you could go a couple of weeks between charges. I recall one reviewer saying he seldom charged it. This shaver has a sideburn and mustache trimmer that is a nice touch, just be careful when you get close to ears, nose or any body part because it can nick you. It can be elevated and retracted so make sure it is retracted until you&#x27;re ready to do trimming, and then keep it facing the opposite direction. It will keep your sideburns and mustache nicely sculpted. I like the look, feel, and ease of use of this shaver. It is an outstanding value and an excellent example of the latest shaving technology. You can even use it in the shower, or shave with cream of gel for a real smooth shave, although the lubrication somewhat defeats the cutting ability of the shaver. If you want a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow or stubble effect, shaving with cream is the way to go, and it makes for a relaxing, comforting shave. I&#x27;m really glad I discovered this shaver because it has saved me tons of $ on straight shaver blades. This shaver is strongly recommended; it delivers a smooth, clean shave and you will not be disappointed. One or two trips to the store to buy standard shaving blades will pay for this electric shaver. You can use it to shave body hair with decent results, but again, watch out for nicks with the retractable sideburn trimmer. This shaver is primarily designed for facial shaving.</li>
    <li> This product is effective.</li>
    <li> it is no match for a blade.takes a long time to get a close shave.even so ,it is really not close.i would not recommend it...i have yet to find an electric shaver that cando what it puports to do...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for about 40 years, which included Remington, Norelco, Panasonic, and Braun models.  My previous unit was also a Braun Series 3-340 shaver which held up well and was still working when I bought this current edition.  The reason I replaced the older unit was that I had dropped the shaver a few times and the sideburn trimmer had fallen apart as a result.  After 5 years of use, the shaver still shaved well and its&#x27; battery was still going strong.  This current model shaves my usual 3-day growth extremely well and is quieter than the previous unit.  I love how the blades/head hug the contours around my chin and jaw.  It is also easier to clean than my previous shaver, easier to handle, and comes with a head protector and a charging stand.  I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 3 weeks and so far have got around 8 shaves off the first charge which is impressive.  Time will tell how the unit holds up and how long the battery lasts but I am well pleased so far and would definitely buy one again.</li>
    <li> very good, I care much</li>
    <li> Replacing my old Braun after many years of service. The only brand I would ever buy. The new one shaves perfectly and needs recharging only every few weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a ten year old electric that I used for a quick touch up between blade shaves.  I&#x27;ve used this one by itself for the last few weeks and I find that it does a reasonably good job.  The initial charge experience was a bit strange,because the green charge light does NOT stay lit throughout  the charging process.  I thought that there was a problem, but I contacted Braun Tech services and found out this was normal.  The initial charge took about seven or eight hours and I now charge it for about an hour once a week when the red low battery light turns on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself shaves relatively close on face, cheek, and chin areas.  I find that I need to spend a lot of time with the trimmer on the neck and upper lip area.  I generally daily shave after my morning shower.  I do NOT use this in the shower though I think you can.  It cleans easily under running water and there is a small brush that helps.  It appears to be well sealed enough to use in the shower, but that&#x27;s just not my routine.  It&#x27;s not as close as a blade shave, but it does fine for me.  It has improved after a few weeks as my face has adapted to regular use of an electric again.&lt;br /&gt;There was a little redness and irritation on my neck for the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a reasonably priced alternative to the electrics with the fancy cleaning systems that can cost $200-$400.  I just can&#x27;t see spending that amount of money.  I also think that it&#x27;s crazy to spend $3 or $4 a week for disposable razors or blades.  This is a much more environmentally friendly and economical alternative in my opinion.  I look forward to years of regular use. though I may hang on to my blade razor to use once a week or so for a really close shave.  It should be noted that the manufacturer recommends changing the screen and cutter assembly about every eighteen months.  These seem to be fairly available on Amazon at a cost in the mid $20 range.</li>
    <li> Great close shave, long lasting battery, easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;First time user of non-Phillips shaver...happy I made the switch! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves it.  This is his first electric shaver and he thought he would never own much less like an electric shaver because he has only heard complaints from other men about how their shaver pulls their hair.  He now enjoys shaving.</li>
    <li> The 340S-4 is a nicely designed package. It only operates unplugged. If you are plugged in the razor will not operate. Why??&lt;br /&gt;  The 340S-4 gives only a fair shave leaving enough beard that I can feel it after a thorough shave.&lt;br /&gt;  Not recommended. Not up to Braun standards.</li>
    <li> Kept trying it for about a week thinking that I just needed to get the hang of it... finally gave up and went back to my trusty Mach 3</li>
    <li> My husband has a mole on his chin and he has a hard time saving around it. This shaver is gentle and worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Braun is the best shaver. It can cut beard in any corner on my face and neck. And Its foil and cutter is very well designed  to be safe and use long. So I am not afraid of shaving my beard by my Braun shaver every day. One advice I want to give is its body little think to handle easy and be cheaper in price. I love Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> Seems like it is very well built…  It is attractive and very easy to use, the pop up trimmer works great…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the foil type razor just does NOT work well for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure what makes one razor work well for one person, but not another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have very thick and fast growing whiskers, maybe that makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the only type of electric razor that I have found that works well for me is the rotary, lift and cut style from Norelco.</li>
    <li> May be shaved Braun Series 3-340s&lt;br /&gt;Is a product you know and love.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.  I bought it to replace one that he&#x27;d used for 7 years.  It does not irritate his face and shaves very closely.</li>
    <li> it is great and so fast of the shipment.</li>
    <li> amazon American is very very good！&lt;br /&gt;The Chinese people&#x27;s congratulation！&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very very good！ 给美帝点赞！&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;直邮中国 1号发货 5号收货 DHL给力！</li>
    <li> This is my first time shopping experience. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great Item! Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> Was a little disappointed with the feel of quality. Had an older one same model, new one feels a little cheaper made. The shave was as good as the older model. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> my first electric shaver.  it&#x27;s very convenient! i could use while i take a shower. and can use shave gell, easy to clean, it&#x27;s AWESOME</li>
    <li> The product arrived sooner than stated and my soon loves it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is horrible compared to the last one I bought. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Excellent wet and dry, compact, light and very accesible price</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Braun shavers.  I bought 2 of them, because my beard is like cutting a wire brush so I need 2 so I can switch off when I&#x27;m shaving. But thats not the best part this was the best deal on the price I&#x27;ve found. I am a Braun fan and have been buying Braun&#x27;s for years but this price WOW! But this Braun is one of the best models, plus the trimmer blade is an under appreciated feature. Using a trimmer saves the foil and in hard to reach areas like sideburns and upper lip area the best. Gives better definition. As you can see I really believe in this product.  This new Braun recharges much faster than other models. Initial charge took half the time as any other shaver. (My brother-in-law&#x27;s). Of course he is taking his back and getting a Braun.</li>
    <li> For those of you looking for an electric shaver. The Braun 3Series is an excellent choice.  It performs well, no tugging at your skin and the design fits nicely in your hands.</li>
    <li> I was always a triple head shaver user for years. I thought I would try a foil shaver. The Braun got good reviews so I tried it. The battery on the Braun last a very long time before it has to be charged. The shave was close but not any closer than my old triple header. I found I had to go over my face a few more passes than the triple header to get all the whiskers and sometimes I will feel a long hair on my face that the Braun missed a few times for it to get that long. Also when shaving without a shirt I feel the cut whiskers bouncing off my chest and I can scrape up a small pile of cut whiskers on the counter by the bathroom sink. The triple header collects the cut whiskers better. I gave it 3 stars because it is not a bad shaver but I will be returning to a Triple header.</li>
    <li> The best.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever owned! I have very sensitive skin and can run this all over my face without any irritation whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it dry, I have used it wet. I usually do wet because it makes shaving smoother. However this is so smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, I actually prefer dry shaving with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good shaver that you can&#x27;t go wrong with.</li>
    <li> I have a medium beard, and this shaves almost as close as a three blade vibrating razor.  I use it wet with shaving cream, and dry, both with good results.  NOT ONE NICK OR BURN in the 6 months that I have used it.  Hold a charge well.  Good price, imo.</li>
    <li> Barber soft and smooth</li>
    <li> smooth, quiet, colse shave, love it</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described, fast shipping, great seller, A++</li>
    <li> Work as described. I could not ask for more..</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this razor. If I don&#x27;t shave twice a day it will not cut one days growth of beard. Takes about 15 minutes to shave and is very difficult to clean. Works better wet with shaving cream I would not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the highly rated Panasonic Vortex ES8249. The Panasonic has 4 blades and is extremely well built. It also comes with an automatic cleaning station. Why did I end up returning it and keeping the Braun instead? The Panasonic does provide a very close shave however I found that I have to go over certain areas several times to accomplish a close shave. The Braun has only 3 blades however I was able to get a closer and faster shave with the Braun with just 1-2 passes. I have been able to get a razor close shave with the Braun within 3 minutes. I found the shave to actually be more precise and closer than the Panasonic. The Panasonic would take me over 5 minutes. The build quality of the Braun is excellent. It is built like a tank and very comfortable to hold. It has a rubber liner that makes holding it very secure and comfortable. It is actually much quieter than the Panasonic. The Panasonic has a very loud high pitched sound....similar to a hair trim clipper that barbers use. The one complaint that I do have is that Braun should have included a protective cover for the blades. It does come with a protective travel case however a guard is a must to protect the most delicate part of the shaver which is the foils. The price, performance, build quality and low cost of maintenance makes this an excellent value. The replacement blade/foil runs around $20 compared to $50 for the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a back-up to my 7000 Series Flex.  It is a great razor for the price.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this shaver since the last time I used an electric shaver was when I used my Dad&#x27;s when I was 16.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the excitement ended after my first few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I used the shaver exactly as shown in the instructions and held it at a 90 degree angle to my face. It seemed to be working and I heard the &amp;#34;lawn mowing&amp;#34; sounds as it should be. However, the shave was not close at all. Within an hour I could feel stubble, as opposed to not feeling stubble for 6 hours using a conventional razor.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it another try a day later after a bit of growth, same thing.&lt;br /&gt;It received 2 stars just because it&#x27;s easy to hold and I don&#x27;t look half bad with minor stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the prongs you insert from the cord of the charger base into the electrical socket don&#x27;t have the one wider prong, so it kept falling out of the socket!&lt;br /&gt;Poorly manufactured.</li>
    <li> Bought a new model after years of good service from another Braun.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. My husband says it is a wonderful shaver and its a snap to get ready in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome.  Clean, easy shave.  Quiet.  One charge lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I really like it. It is a very comfortable shave and close. As people have said, it is a bit challenging to shave around the neck, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a problem specific to this electric razor. I&#x27;m hoping I get better at it.</li>
    <li> bought one for myself and one for my son both of us love them</li>
    <li> great first shaver for grandson</li>
    <li> Horrible.....don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. It can clean the beard thoroughly and it is very powerful.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it.So far works pretty good</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I had to ship it back.</li>
    <li> Works as well as any foil-type shaver.  Haven&#x27;t used it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; but it works fine as a dry shaver. This replaces an old Braun foil shaver I had before.  I like the fact that this is a rechargeable, so I&#x27;m not limited to the length of the cord.  It does a decent job for that quick shave when you don&#x27;t have time to use the razor (or rush and knick yourself with the razor).</li>
    <li> Good product, overall. I&#x27;ve used Braun for many years, and have never been disappointed. This one, so far so good after  a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;I read comments about the delicate ON/OFF button, so I&#x27;m being very gentle with it.&lt;br /&gt;Past Braun shavers were very solid.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Easy cleaning; dry/wet; close shave (for me); long lasting charge; if similar to older models quality, it will last for many years to come. I noticed that weight has been added to the blades for an easier-faster shave (simple, but brilliant engineering); much quieter than my older Braun shaver, that was very old and I still keep as a backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Cannot use it while charging as with older models... not a big deal, though.</li>
    <li> I think Philips is better.</li>
    <li> Excellent, and management functionality allows a shave lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
    <li> Best shave with an electric shaver ever</li>
    <li> Very good product，I like it!</li>
    <li> Very good, very clean shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 years.  It doesn&#x27;t do a great close shave.  My previous Remington did a better job.  The charge lasts pretty long though.  All in all it was decent, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I think I bought well at a good price.. : )</li>
    <li> very good! made in China</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor. I am very pleased with it and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> yes, I do like it for the handiness of it, but I&#x27;ll have to get use to it. I&#x27;ve always use a regular type razor, takes less time to shave. with the old way,  but I do like it.  yes I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Shaving is very good, can charge for a long time, is clean, it is recommended to use.</li>
    <li> I got a Braun shaver more than 15 years ago for my husband for Christmas and he loves it so much (still) that we got this one for our son who now loves his too!</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, used a norelco rotary for years and swore that I would never go back to a foil shaver but this one works great. Easy to clean and can be used with gel or cream. My norelco might of been a tad quieter but not by much. Love my new Braun.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVER AND WOULD BUY AGAIN AND PROMPT DELIVERYGREAT DRY OR WET</li>
    <li> Every day &#x3D; 2 min.  Skip a day  ,or two &#x3D; 3 min.  45 min. shave time per charge.  re-charge 1 hr.</li>
    <li> Does a great job haven&#x27;t tested if it&#x27;s water proof because, i&#x27;m sacred but; does a good job at shaving.</li>
    <li> Very good Hope to have more products to China</li>
    <li> Great razor..I have aways liked a Brauns razor.. Glad I finally found one..been looking for quite awhile..amazon is the best</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, works well with shaving cream. Tends to leave a few hairs behind when dry shaving, but overall works very well between razor shaves. Would recommend to others!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for my type of beard.</li>
    <li> Help my colleagues to buy, very good, very satisfied, packaging is also good</li>
    <li> Very Happy with this purchase for my husband. Hard to find a good shaver.</li>
    <li> Very good. Although not very quiet, but very comfortable.</li>
    <li> too big but it&#x27;s $48. :)</li>
    <li> Good shaver, good price.</li>
    <li> The Braun 340 works ok but doesn&#x27;t give me the close shave that I usually get&#x27; So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to any of my family or friends. Even though I come from a family of 10 brothers.</li>
    <li> This shaver&#x27;s power is so strong that if you hold it too long your hand will  be  numbness . Except for this ,I think it work well.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I thought it was terrible and that I had made a huge mistake! I shave my whole head and was tired of trying to find a razor that worked well, so I tried this.  As I said before, first time was terrible and took forever to get a reasonably close shave, however, the second shave was quick and easy and just what I was looking for in a razor. I have had this for a month now and would buy it again! Couldn&#x27;t tell you why it was so useless that first shave and then improved, but it did!! Hope this helps! Steve</li>
    <li> Good Staff, very light weight.</li>
    <li> i bought this shaver for a christmas gift for hubby.  after 3 months it would barely cut and he shaves 2xs a week.  i bought it because it was a mid-range priced shaver, wrong choice.</li>
    <li> My husband thinks it is great.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son. He likes it but doesn&#x27;t love it. Prefers the remington his mother bought him.</li>
    <li> Good price and good product</li>
    <li> It is good for gift my friends</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband, and he loves it!  Each day when he uses it, he tells me how much he likes it!</li>
    <li> Powerful motor, smooth cutting, water is basic, am satisfied with everything.</li>
    <li> good quality,but without a portable case is a little inconvenient</li>
    <li> A good medium priced razor that has lasted my husband about six months... I hope it keeps on ticking for the promised 18 months it is supposed to last (the foil and cutters, that is). You have to work at a perfect smooth shave about the same as all other electric razors, but it gets the job done and one charge lasts a week for his usage, which is nice.</li>
    <li> the noise is too loud</li>
    <li> is not sharp and strong,I should buy another one</li>
    <li> After reviewing several electric shavers, I bought this one as a Christmas gift. My guy has very sensitive skin, so I was worried about the shaver irritating his skin. Also, he&#x27;s not someone who is going to read through manuals and follow specific cleaning directions. I wanted a shaver that&#x27;d be easy to clean and delicate on skin. At first, I considered a Panasonic shaver due to the simple rinse-under-water cleaning method. But for the Panasonic, several reviews mentioned the need to replace foils and blades every 6 months. In addition to this, they were also displeased by the expense of such foils and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Series 3-340s checked all the boxes and exceeded my expectations. The closeness of shave is as good as a five blade Gillette razor, with no irritation. I really can&#x27;t tell the difference in the shave between the shaver or the razor. In terms of the battery, he charged it for half the day on Dec. 26th, and he&#x27;s used it nearly every day since (today being 1/10) and the battery is still working strong from the initial charge. The shaver is very easy to clean by shaking it under running water. Also, the manual states to replace the foils every 18 months, plus they are half the price of the Panasonic foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expected him to use it so often, let alone call it his favorite gift. All around, we are both extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Bought two as gift and they like it!</li>
    <li> nice item, fast express</li>
    <li> There is something wrong with the recharging function.  The first shaver died after a week or so and I could never get it to come back on regardless of how long I left it in the charger.  The replacement sent never worked at all.  I haven&#x27;t received its replacement as of yet.  Not holding my breath.</li>
    <li> It was supposed as a Christmas gift for my husband, but the internatinal post was so slow. However, it shaver is wonderful so it fix the problem of being late. My husband finally throw the older one which was from his friend.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a shaver that would work for me. As a black man, I have found that electric shavers don&#x27;t appear to be too well suited to the grain of my hair, which is a little thicker than others.  I have been using a 3-head rotary shaver for years, but wanted to try a different type. I was a bit skeptical of Braun shavers, as I tried one in the past and was not too impressed.  However, on the strength of some of the reviews I read, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been disappointed. The shaver does a great job of leaving my face feeling smooth and clean in what seems to be much less time than the rotary shaver did.  It is also washable, which is a must for me.  I have been using the shaver for 3 months now, and I am still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tried a wet shave, as I haven&#x27;t found anything that I can use for a wet, electric shave. Suggestions from other reviewers is welcomed.</li>
    <li> works very well,  but I sometimes hear a little noise that I did not in my previous shaver&amp;#62; I wonder if it indicates something is not quite straight in the body of the shaver.</li>
    <li> Product worked as expected</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this shaver.  It had a lot of good reviews so I bought it anticipating a great shaver.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go for one of the more expensive Brauns.  It charges quickly, and has a strong motor but does not shave that close and it takes forever to grind my beard off.  Sometimes I just give up and pull out the safety razor.  The Remington rotary that it replaced had a very weak battery from the day I purchased it and sometimes wouldn&#x27;t even finish a shave, but it did cut closely and relatively quick.  I guess I am going back to safety razors.</li>
    <li> On time, good review, good product, good price and does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> I should have switched to electric sooner!  Works very well, especially in the wet mode.  Cleans very easily.  Not quite as&lt;br /&gt;good a shave as the new blades, but when you&#x27;re retired, who cares.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this unit!!</li>
    <li> Great razor !  Easy to clean ,  not like the rotary razors that clog up !</li>
    <li> Excellent razor for the price. I have used a Norelco wet razor for years and prefer this one for less money.</li>
    <li> Works well and the price is right</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver. I have only used it for dry shaving, however I have a really sensitive skin and this shaver didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I am pleased with that aspect of it. Battery also seems to last quite a long time, I would say a week or so with regular use. Only reason I give it 4/5 stars is because I wish the base model included the additional tool for under-nose shaving, which I think 380 has. But overall I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product after reading many five star reviews from women using this on their legs. Sadly, I have been using it for around three weeks and it is just as much work as shaving with a non-electric razor. The beard trimmer works well but doesn&#x27;t offer a close enough shave for legs (not that I expected it to) but the head barely cuts the hairs at all.</li>
    <li> I shave both my head and beard on a daily basis. This razor works well for both. It is comfortable, quiet and gives a better shave compared to the Panasonic ES-RT51 I had been using.  The battery lasted for a week on one charge.  The trimmer works well, and the unit cleans easily. I am very happy with this razor and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it, I use it twice a week and I am still on the first charge (almost a month).  Price dropped by 50% now but that doesn&#x27;t take away from quality of item.</li>
    <li> NO, NO, NO. I had two pair of these and the head broke on both of them. Ant worth your time. I HAVE A BROKEN ONE AT MY BED AND CAN&#x27;T USE IT.  I hate to keep returning them but i have to.. Shame. Must be a deftct. I have to re-order and then return these old ones so they will honor the 30 day warnity .. I don&#x27;t want to just be short the money.. I have used Braun many, many times but this is a big NO&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Works fine but only cuts day old beard well. Otherwise takes a long time to cut. Replacement blades only work for 3-4 months before they need to be replaced. I use it to shave my head too so the may be why blade life is so short.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t purchased a new shaver in over 5-6 years, and this made me enjoy shaving again.  My old shaver had started to irritate my face, but this one is so perfectly smooth.  The closeness of the shave is much improved over my previous, more expensive shaver.  Compared to the $200 models, I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re sacrificing a lot here.  Highly recommended, and I wish I wouldve bought this years ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my old 340 for about 8 years and loved it.  when I got this new one, it reminded me of how good the old one used to be.  wow..</li>
    <li> Works pretty good, and for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it. Shaves under the nose closer than my last shaver, works wet or dry. So if you like shaving in the shower, this will work.</li>
    <li> A good value for the money, but not the best that I have used in the under $100.00 category.</li>
    <li> One of the better shavers I have ever used. I like the lack of bells and whistles. I never liked the swivel-head technology, nor the self-cleaning technology. So I am glad this model does not have all the numerous features of higher cost shavers.  Seems to provide one of the closest shaves as well. This is a great case of &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34;, and it falls within a very reasonable price range. So thank you Braun for making such a great product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver after many years with an old Bruan of similar design.  Cleaner uses same cartridge and is replaceable.  This shaver has worked better than advertised from the first day and only has gotten better the longer I use it.  I have talked two of my friends into purchasing the same unit.  Can not go wrong with these shavers.</li>
    <li> Had one for many years. Felt it was time to update with a most satisfactory product.</li>
    <li> Over 40 odd years of shaving I&#x27;ve tried several electric shavers and none of them lived up to the hype or claims.  It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the Braun was on sale at Amazon and I was really &amp;#34;itching&amp;#34; to try a newer generation electric shaver.  So I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this electric shaver does everything the manufacturer claims.  It really works well and I&#x27;m very pleased that I bought it.  It&#x27;s easy to use, provides a very close shave and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  I really can&#x27;t find a downside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works well with just a day or two of beard stubble.  If I let it go any longer it seems to have some trouble with the longer whiskers.  But, Braun also tells you that&#x27;s the case, so fair enough.  My job doesn&#x27;t require that I be clean-shaven every day so I don&#x27;t.  But this electric really makes shaving, which I really don&#x27;t like doing, much easier and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality product, it feels substantial in the hand, comes apart easily for cleaning and will provide numerous shaves between charges.  The attached trimmer works well, too, though I haven&#x27;t used it a lot.  I also haven&#x27;t had the need to use the shaver in &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; mode, such as in the shower.  Braun recommends shaving before washing your face and that seems to be what works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good electric shaver that really works well and is reasonably priced, you&#x27;ll have a hard time finding a better one.</li>
    <li> Shaves better wet than dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I have a bald head and it shaves real close down to the grain the way I like it leaving my head smooth and clean. I use my Andis liners first, then go back over my head with the Braun shaver for a crisp look.</li>
    <li> Holding the hand caught the center is easy to use. The cutting forces than the Philips equipment seems to be good.</li>
    <li> Works great if you need to shave your head. You&#x27;ll need to get it short with another set of clippers then finish it off with this. Don&#x27;t forget to use Lectric Shave though!</li>
    <li> I went from a much more expensive Philips rotary shaver to this one.  The primary reason being that the rotary shaver just wasn&#x27;t getting the hairs that are in the more challenging contours of my face, like the upper lip area right under the nose.  Only a foil type shaver seems to get the job done for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve traveled the world on business, and one thing you always see in duty free shops at every big airport are electric razors.  I&#x27;ve bought several over the years and most of them cost multiple times what this model is being sold for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor performs as advertised, and the build quality is better than I had expected at this price.  My facial hair grows quickly.  I keep this razor in my car for times when I am away from home or on the road for extended periods of time and unable to conveniently use a straight razor and oil to get a proper shave.  I am more than satisfied with the quality and price.  It came with a handy stand, and a plastic guard that protects the blade and most importantly, prevents the razor from accidentally turning on as it rolls around in your bag.  When this one wears out, I&#x27;ll likely buy another of the same model.  Does it perform like a $300 razor?  Probably not, but with the price and relative quality of this model, I sometimes wonder why I ever bought all of those expensive razors.</li>
    <li> great shaver, trimmer, recharges fast</li>
    <li> Works great been using Braun razors for years. Great price.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the performance of this electric razor. I get a very close shave even on my neck which is difficult for me with other electric razors. I use Lectric Shave for a very smooth close shave. Hope this razor hold up.</li>
    <li> Use this on both my head and face, gets the job done quick and extremely well, closer shave than a blade with no cuts! Charges very quickly as well.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3-340S shaver is excellent. Now I know how good my skin feels after a perfect clean shave. It removes even tiny bits of hair unlike the lousy razors. It&#x27;s also easy to use with and without shaving foam. The shaver comes with a dock; the dock has a separate charging slot which enables us to charge the shaver when docked.  The design is perfect and gives a good grip. Cleaning is very easy too.  Overall, a very good buy. Absolutely satisfied.</li>
    <li> My grandson was &amp;#34;very&amp;#34; happy with this.  It was a hit!</li>
    <li> A very  close shave with few passes on my coarse medium whiskers.  I read many reviews of this and other shavers before purchase which led me straight to this Braun.</li>
    <li> Finally my husband got a shaver that works!  It does not cut his face and so far is holding up great!</li>
    <li> the stand is not as i saw in the picture and its much smaller.  nothing wrong with the item apart of the bad idea of the ad for the item.  hope everything is real in the future.</li>
    <li> Very good!Shaving is easy and clean!</li>
    <li> 价格verygood.o(╯□╰)o。。。。。。。。</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave, great quality. Battery lasts long between charges. For the money, way better than a similar Panasonic model I&#x27;ve owned that costs more.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in 35 years. This thing is awesome! I use it dry and get a very close shave, rivaling the best available razors I&#x27;ve used. No skin irritaion at all, even going against the grain. I truly didn&#x27;t expect this quality of a shaver!</li>
    <li> Blades were SHARP, be careful.</li>
    <li> Worst razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. Does not work when plugged in to charge, so if you run out of batteries mid-shave, you&#x27;re SOL.</li>
    <li> This does not shave! Is it even on? Seriously I spent 20 minutes trying to shave a patch on my leg. Any patch! Did not cut at all! After trying to scrape my skin to get closer to the hairs in shaved them so little bit that it didn&#x27;t even make a difference! Even at the closest shave from this thing it looks like you didn&#x27;t shave at all. You will never get a smooth shave with this. The best it can do is leave you with obvious stuble like your hair grew back 2 or 3 days after a shave, when you shave! Seriously it&#x27;s just a vibrating price of plastic with decorative metal at top. Return!</li>
    <li> had a panasonic that was great but there was only one website i could find online to buy the rechargeable batteries and they did not last for long so got tired of wasting cash&lt;br /&gt;purchased this braun with high hopes, i was impressed with the first shave!!!  was QUIET which was nice,well designed (feels nice in your hand)&lt;br /&gt;very clean shave and even clean shaved the neck area that the panasonic could never tackle, had to finish this area with a bic......so far very happy with purchase and used for a week without charging yet!!!</li>
    <li> Gave as gift to son, he used it once when home for Christmas and said he really likes it.  It was easy to use and did a great job for him.  Have not heard anything since.</li>
    <li> Ok so far....i rate it a 3</li>
    <li> The best in the range of 50 box</li>
    <li> not as good as PHIPH,not very clean .</li>
    <li> Nice razor. I like it. Watch out for the &#x27;frequently bought together&#x27; advertising. This model does not use the Clean and Renew system, so there is no need to buy the refill kit.  I took Amazons word for it and bought all three items advertised. Now I am stuck with the $20.14 refill kit. Like the razor, not happy with the advertising gimmick. Anybody want to purchase it from me?</li>
    <li> I love it. Works as intended and very nice that you can use it wet. I&#x27;ve always been pleased with Braun&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> This shaver is not half bad, I was able to get it on sale for about 40 bucks. I use it as a wet shaver with shaving cream and it glides pretty smooth. If you have a few stubborn hairs that grow right against the skin you might need 2-3 passes. Overall for the price you probably won&#x27;t find a better shaver. If you buy it make sure to rinse the blades at the top before you use, they come with a liberal application of oil.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> Everything turned out okay, Thank You FJG</li>
    <li> This works great for my husband. Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> my last braun razor lasted almost 10 years, i hope this one does as well. i like it, just wish it had a cleaning station like my last one does, it says to just clean under hot water, but i feel it doesnt clean it as well. but in the past 3 months of owning, i have not had any issues</li>
    <li> It is a lot easier than shaving the old way with Gilette.</li>
    <li> it is nice and beautiful.</li>
    <li> good price good quality</li>
    <li> Better using gel than cream.  Handy razor,easy cleaning.  Would probably buy again because of good price and free shipping.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a birthday gift for my husband.  Provides a close, comfortable shave.  Stays charged more than a week.  He is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Compare with Philips RQ1150x, it sounds and shakes more. But it also shaves better and quicker. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Works great so far (1 week). Much quieter than old Braun. I like the charging stand. Long-time Braun user. Old Braun still works but after 4 years felt it more cost-effective to upgrade rather than buy another  new head.</li>
    <li> This electric razor replaced another Braun razor that was about 10 years old. The old one was kept in good working order. This 340S-4 works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it arrived, charged it up and started using it. No lotions, creams.....just a dry face and the razor. Works well......even on 3 day stubble. My old razor would barely touch the stuff. My kids comment on how much smoother my face is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only had it a few weeks so cannot comment on it long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a razor that shaves clean and does not cost a mint, check this one out.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. He hates shaving every morning and it sucks he has to since he doesn&#x27;t grow much facial hair but the military is boss. I figured with an electric shaver, he could just take 3 minutes and shave while hes in the truck waiting for formation. I&#x27;ve read for daily shaving, foil shavers are best. For longer hairs and less frequent shaving, rotary is best. But I had a heck of time finding an affordable foil shaver until I found this one! So far he loves it! Very smooth, easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t take up hardly any counter space. He says he likes how it conforms with his face well and charges fast.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my Dad. It works great and does the job much better than other electric razors he has had.</li>
    <li> Very good shave, and my colleague like it.</li>
    <li> BEST one out there!&lt;br /&gt;We have purchased and returned SO many of these!!&lt;br /&gt;This one was different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even good for a women&#x27;s &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; shave!</li>
    <li> It truly meet my need! I love it</li>
    <li> I am an African-American male and this shaver by far is the best shaver I have ever owned. Most shavers I tried seem to target thinner &amp;#34;Caucasian&amp;#34; hair, they don&#x27;t take into consideration that there are us people with extremely coarse hair on their faces. I have natural curly hair, and this shaver gets the little stubbles the other shavers would leave behind. I have tried several other brands and I had to return them all because they didn&#x27;t do the job. This shaver hands down is the best and the price is right. Money well spent!!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor.  Close shave, and is really quiet.  Glad I made the choice to buy this one, husband is very pleased with it.  Does not irritate his face like his old rotary razor did.  It also works for the women who want a better razor than what is out there currently.  Works well on face and legs.  Had to get one for both  of us, and don&#x27;t regret it one bit.</li>
    <li> Holds charge much longer than one week they claim. I&#x27;ve used it every other day for three weeks and still doesn&#x27;t need a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I have trouble removing small thin hairs on neck. I look presentable but nothing like a razor shave. Would definitly buy again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut well.  Leaves whiskers when you go over it.  When you don&#x27;t shave for one day, next day it feels like it&#x27;s pulling hair out by the roots.  Worst razor my husband ever had.</li>
    <li> This is a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my father-in-law. It is a perfect shavor and he loves it very much.</li>
    <li> This is a very good  razor. Cuts effort lessly.good product for the price. Larry</li>
    <li> good to use, recommend strongly.</li>
    <li> I think it is really nice. I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable Value and incredibly effective!</li>
    <li> Holds a charge for a long time, works great wet, gives a pretty close shave in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> To me,it&#x27;s a little bigger.</li>
    <li> It is a great shaver with great price. Before this one, I used an old Phlips shaver. I feel this Braun 340s is better at least for myself.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.I would have liked a carrying case with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Had an earlier series BRAUN and loved it too...but when it came time for another cutter and foil change, this Series 3-340s was priced not much higher than replacement parts, so I bought it...Man am I happy!  This one works even better than my old unit when it was new...Better battery life, and closer shave...You know from the picture I honestly thought the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; (cutter and foil&amp;#34; were the same basic configuration as my old unit, But I noticed that while the foil is pretty much similar, the cutting head is TOTALLY different...anyway the net effect is a closer, quicker shave.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the redesigned side burn trimmer.  The trimmer slides up like the old one, BUT the actual cutting surface is at a 90 degree angle away from the shaver, and while it might &amp;#34;sound&amp;#34; strange&amp;#34; - it WORKs better...better visibility of the trimmer and &amp;#34;target&amp;#34; surface, and less skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I also considered the 3-360/80, but I have never had trouble trimming below my nose, and THIS unit works fine for that without the need for the extra &amp;#34;lever&amp;#34; that the more expensive units have.</li>
    <li> i was happy to use it for the 1st time tiil i reach the neck area. No matter how many passes wet and dry  the hair was still there. Now if i need to use also my regular razor this machine is worthless. I  relied on the score it has on amazon. What a disappointment!!!</li>
    <li> Tends to miss hairs and I feel like I spend more time using this electric razor versus a straight razor. Good for quick trims though.</li>
    <li> yes works really well.</li>
    <li> No good, you have to go over several times for closer shave. Becomes useless after a short time. Not effective in shaving around the neck. Wastage of money.</li>
    <li> Really love this Shaver.Works really good.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut close enough and misses a lot of neck hair.</li>
    <li> It works perfect. I got the smoothest shave ever. I like it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this shaver.  Would buy again  - The head appears to be the same as my more expensive razor.</li>
    <li> I picked this braun after my last one gave out after almist ten years. I didn&#x27;t want to get another self cleaning one as i didn&#x27;t use the feature regularly on the last one. This one shaves closer, and does a better job on neck hairs.</li>
    <li> It is ok. I can not get a close shave from it.</li>
    <li> Other than the price (I paid $75 for it when it can be purchased at a regular price of only $39 at walmart), I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts great and has a good feel.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Panasonic LA-93 for several years.  I like to use shaving cream, and Panasonic was making the only electric shaver designed to use it.  The Panasonic worked well, but was noisy.  When I was due for a new blade, I saw the Braun Series 3-340s on sale at Amazon.  I had used Braun shavers before without much success.  The new Series 3 works well with shaving cream and is much quieter than the Panasonic.  The shave was just as close as the Panasonic.  The Series 3 shaver cost less than new blades for the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I have it for a year and it works perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  Easy to use and holds a charge for a long time.  It cuts long and short hairs and does not burn.  I like it better than the Norelco I replaced.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my dad and he likes it very much. Less noise and clearer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working nice, on dry skin it&#x27;s not that perfect</li>
    <li> Great shave with a simple product</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, and comfortable than my previous Philips, will recommend anyone to buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve previously had a 190 Series from Braun, and it was fine. Cheap enough to through away in a couple of years. But I wanted to try this one, so I spent the extra money. Wow! What a difference! Done shaving in just minutes, instead for 15-20!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the electric razor for a month.  Overall, very happy with the shave.  Not &amp;#34;military&amp;#34; close, but many spots are very close.  Some spots aren&#x27;t, but I chalk that up to my face contours.  Charges quickly.  Cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It missed five stars because I occasionally have to bust out my metal razor to get the occasional hair on my upper lip or the really soft hair toward the edges of my face/neck.  It doesn&#x27;&#x27;t seem to cut them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe some pre-shave splash would make it 100%, but I&#x27;m not going to do it.</li>
    <li> My favorite shaver at the best price ever</li>
    <li> Dose not cut that close</li>
    <li> It is a very handy shaver to have on hand and works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Really convenient to be able to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> Be rather baffling returned single.</li>
    <li> This is the second one bought.  Head sometimes pops off when shaving.</li>
    <li> Works very well, I love it.</li>
    <li> I like this razor, and I&#x27;m used to using a blade!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not as good as the one type of 320s-4 which was made in German. and it&#x27;s made in China,not in German,which somehow makes me upset. and it doesn&#x27;t shave clean as the one i have.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected. Seems solid.</li>
    <li> This razor is perfect.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and once with a pretty good stubble and I had very little to no razor burn. It works great and I highly recommend this razor</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Bought this Braun to replace the Panasonic wet/dry shaver that I had for 8 years. I wanted this specific model to trim longer hair such as my mustache and sideburns being that I was in the military. The long hair trimmer went out within the year. The shaver works fine wet or dry and can hold a charge well even after several years. I gave 2 stars cause I had to go out and buy a separate trimmer.</li>
    <li> very good bettle and quality but the nosice is a bit loadly</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco triple header razors for over 20 years and decided to try this Braun.  I am amazed at the closeness and comfort of the shave I get with it.  Should have switched a long time ago.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift and the receiver comments on its effectiveness every time he uses it.  Like the updated technology and quick charge feature.</li>
    <li> I only use Braun shaver cause it last longer than others. This one works great! Recharges quick! Easy to clean! Smooth shaver!</li>
    <li> Bought this razor for my elderly father.  It is simple to use, the price was right and it is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me this razor a few years ago as a Christmas present.  I had picked it out.  Since then I&#x27;ve sent back two of them for warranty replacement.  The failure is always the same - the motor won&#x27;t come on.  Today razor #3 has failed.  I&#x27;m done with Braun.  I&#x27;m going to open this one to see if I can figure out what the problem is but I&#x27;ve already ordered another brand.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent Braun product!!. The price is superb. The performance exceptional.It is easily on a par withother Braun products I have had in the past. Meets and or exceeds on all fronts.</li>
    <li> Huge improvement over my old shaver which was also a Braun and lasted 5 years.  It was one of the cheapest available, charges in just a few minutes (the old one took all night!!) and reduced my shaving time by 10 minutes each day.  Very happy!!!</li>
    <li> Not a good shave and very noisy</li>
    <li> Good!Dad liked!Shaving is very clean</li>
    <li> Not as great as I expected. Had a single head before so the triple was a big jump. Kind of wish I had stayed with the single. A couple times the whole head would pop off (surprise). That&#x27;s just bad design. Perhaps I was just pushing too hard. I don&#x27;t understand the design of the head cover either. I just expected more from Braun. The single head gave me just as good of a shave as this triple head. Oh, well... live and learn.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading reviews, and boy am I glad I did. It works really great dry, and lasted a long time after the first full charge. I&#x27;m sure I will get years of use our of it. Well worth the price</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat Braun for electric shavers. I have tried all brands</li>
    <li> It gave me a surprise, I love the amazon</li>
    <li> Over the years I have had many electric shavers. This shaver has exceeded my expectations. The shave very close. I get many shavings on one charging. I would recommend this shaver to anyone who wants good value along good results.</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver. I usually shave my beard once every two days so have to say this product does shave considerably well. No issue in using it outside of US, all you need is just an universal adapter.</li>
    <li> I had been using one of this item and it is awesome so I gifted it to my brother-in-law. Hope the quality of the product is same experienced by him</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because he wanted to be able to shave in the shower. It works well and gives a good close shave wet or dry. A fogless mirror is a great addition to this purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington shavers for years, but since they started coming from China, the build quality has been steadily declining.  They recently redesigned the screen and cutter to make it cheaper to produce and rendered it virtually useless.  I decided to jump ship and paid quite a bit more for a Braun, thinking they might still be made in Europe.  WRONG! They&#x27;re made in China like most everything else these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been using the Braun Series 3 model 340s for the better part of a year now and here&#x27;s what I found.  It seems to take half again as long to complete a shave as the older Remingtons and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to remove all the hair from the neck area just below the chin.  Granted, that&#x27;s not easy to do, but the Braun has a special screen and cutter in between the main screens that&#x27;s supposed to get the longer hairs.  It doesn&#x27;t cut them and tends to pull them instead.  My four-o&#x27;clock shadow appears a little after noon time.  Now, my beard is neither heavy nor dark in color, sad to say that it&#x27;s mostly gray these days.  The battery doesn&#x27;t stay charged as long as previous shavers I&#x27;ve had, probably due to the additional time it takes to shave with this one.  We&#x27;re talking less than a week, while I&#x27;ve had others last 10-11 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Braun has a 60-day money back guarantee, but be advised that one of the requirements is that you need to send it back in the original packaging.  Stupid me, I threw it out before I read the paperwork.  This shaver is going to need the screen kit replaced in a couple of months, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bother, I&#x27;ll just try another brand.  Not sure what, though...</li>
    <li> Although I  mostly used Panansonic wet and dry I decided to give a try for the Braun equivalent. Previously owned Braun shavers too, I always  thought that Panasonic can make a better and closer shave. The Braun 3 Series is a pleasant suprise. I can get a nice close shave even dry mode. The wet shaving is to be discovered in the future.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think I made a good choice and I will keep this shaver as long as possible.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for a short while (about a month) and would give it high marks for a good shave as well as being easy to keep clean.  The only drawback I experience is that it is noisy compared to my old Norelco rotary shaver but that is to be expected in the two different types of mechanical design.  All-in-all this shaver is worth the price (so far).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this to all the people who are unhappy with the closeness of this shaver. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I felt I had to write this particular product. I  purchased the Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver in April of 2013. In the past I had always been a rotary Norelco man. I wouldn&#x27;t even look at a screen shaver. I was under the misconception that rotarys give a close shave. Was I mistaken. This shaver gives the closest and I mean closets shave I have EVER had. It&#x27;s funny, when I first bought it I felt that i got a comparable shave as my old rotary which consistently left stubble in the hollow areas of my neck which was something I became accustomed to. So after a month of use I figured not much difference, but I might as well keep using it since I paid good money for it and it did give me a comparable shave. Well, I&#x27;m glad I did. After 2 months of stubble, all of a sudden NO MORE STUBBLE ! I can only attribute it to my skin adapting to the shaver. Getting to the bottom line, If you don&#x27;t get immediate results don&#x27;t throw in the towel consider waiting an extra month or so to allow your skin to adapt to this shaver. Ypu&#x27;ll be glad you did because you will be rewarded with a close shave. All I can say is good bye Norelco.</li>
    <li> Solid build. Effective.</li>
    <li> After years of using a 3 head shaver, it died and I ordered this to replace it. Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not shave close to skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Misses hairs and it takes many many passes to get some of them.&lt;br /&gt;- Oh so noisy.&lt;br /&gt;-Takes twice as long to finish a shave as other 3 head shavers I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months I gave up and bought a Philips Norelco AT830/46 Shaver 4500. Like night and day. That shaver is quiet, twice as fast and gets a nice close shave without missing hairs.</li>
    <li> Ok for tattoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK for quick touch up can&#x27;t beat a real blade shave</li>
    <li> finally! i have been blade shaving for decades and just wanted to try an electric shaver. this one does an excellent job</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as much good as I expected i am not ableto get clean shave with this.</li>
    <li> Powerful, durable battery, but need to shave back and forth for couple times to shave thoroughly. Nice and impressive sidebums shaver feature.</li>
    <li> GREAT THANKS AND WHAT A FANTASTIC ITEM.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good ,useful.</li>
    <li> Pretty much as expected. Better than the other style I bought some months ago. Way short of a good blade shave, but convenient.</li>
    <li> very good for use, a little noisy</li>
    <li> It works fine, but it just doesn&#x27;t give you that close shave feeling.</li>
    <li> Buy special offer, go to China for 10 days. To use, the ratio of first! Performance is good</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for more than 45 years.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten, better than on any of the previous shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is excellent too.</li>
    <li> So the razor turned out to be good. I bought it for the charger to charge my old one and ever since i have just been using this one. It does not do the work of the big boy razors ($300+) but it does what its made to do. It feels comfortable in the hand. It has a decent LED that shows battery status. It fits well with its charger stand deal if you so choose to use it. The protective cover that snaps over the blades is also nice. The packaging is mostly recyclable. I have had it for several months now and it holds a charge for a LONG time in my opinion. Yep. Thats about all i got. I dont think you will be disappointed with it if you so choose to purr chase this razor.</li>
    <li> My husband has a gift.&lt;br /&gt; Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Absolutely  good My skin is sensitive  but it makes any trouble</li>
    <li> Excellent product, my favorite brand of shavers. My skin love it.</li>
    <li> rerplaced an older one, what a difference...face smooth and no pulls.</li>
    <li> Stopped working right after 30 days after purchasing it, was good when it worked. These things usually last forever! Will change my rating if I get a response back because I want to rate it based on its quality when it actually worked.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver.</li>
    <li> So far I like it very much</li>
    <li> Shave was good , but very poor quality. Would not shut off after only on week of use. Panisonic ES8103 much better shaver.</li>
    <li> Braun is one of those name brands known for their quality and long-lasting products. My husband has had the same Braun shaver for years, up until recently it did the job but lately the blades have been dulling and it looks worse for the wear. I decided to get him a new one and I really didn&#x27;t want to spend over a hundred for one. This is almost identical to his previous razor I spent a hundred on but it doesn&#x27;t come with the cleaning unit. (The cleaning unit hadn&#x27;t worked properly in years anyhow.) For the price and having a trimmer to boot, it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m just hoping this lasts as long as his previous shaver. For all intended purposes this product does a close shave and that&#x27;s all that matters to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m beside myself with the purchase of this product. It is something that I should have purchased years ago. My barber uses a Wahl brand but I absolutely love this. And the price! Wow! Too happy...</li>
    <li> I wish is would cut soft fine hair as well as is cuts my husbands facial hair.  Bought it to use on my legs, but it&#x27;s not as good at that as it is his face so he uses it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for elderly person and I must read and follow the instructions before giving an honest review. Item is lightweight and attractive looking</li>
    <li> It works very well and the price is attractive. It works over 2 weeks once fully charged. The shape is very nice and the color looks expensive.</li>
    <li> Like many other Norelco owners, I was forced to return to the Braun camp on account of Norelco having discontinued manufacture of replacement parts for their best electric razor(s). :-( I thought this Braun unit would be an adequate substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For three months I used this Braun model, and every time I cursed it and deeply regretted my purchase of it. It chafed me, it cut me (regularly), and I could not get a close enough shave with it no matter how hard I tried. In four decades of shaving I could not remember any electric razor causing me so much grief. Now I am going to explain away the Achilles&#x27; heel of this razor AND give you the solution to the problem!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY was the problem occurring? Because I wasn&#x27;t following instructions, obviously—LOL. Yes, I was using it in the shower—which you are NOT supposed to do and I do NOT recommend you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the precautions never say anything remotely close to &amp;#34;Never use this razor on a wet face!&amp;#34;—so let us proceed under the assumption that you are merely using the razor on a (your) wet face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with a small tube of oil—don&#x27;t lose it! In the manual, Braun advises that &amp;#34;if you regularly clean the shaver under water, then once a week apply a drop of light machine oil onto the long hair trimmer…and shaver Foil &amp; Cutter cassette.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction SHOULD go something like this: &amp;#34;If you like to completely wet your face before shaving, no problem, you will LOVE the awesomely close shave you&#x27;ll receive every time. ALL you have to remember is this: Every Single Time You Shave, you MUST MUST MUST remember to apply a drop of light machine oil (from the tube we so smartly have included with this model) onto a fingertip, and then carefully rub said oil into every single square millimeter of the long hair trimmer AND all the outward-facing metal parts of the shaver Foil &amp; Cutter cassette.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr: keep the Foil &amp; Cutter cassette oiled (oil it after every wet shave!), and you will love this razor</li>
    <li> love it and it works great and my face feels smooth</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s quite good I guess nothing works as well as a multi blade razor and shaving cream. The razor itself is well made, no issues there. Cleans easy.</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for use on my head and I absolutely love it.  Takes away all the stubble and I get a smooth feel all around with little to no irritation.  I can usually do about 3 rounds of head shaving before I have to charge it again so the battery life is just fine for me.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good shaver for your head.</li>
    <li> terrible shaver. cuts up my whole face I have used several other electric shavers and this is by far the worst. This model is simply unusable barley cuts and irritates the skin.</li>
    <li> Broke after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> a gift for my dad~good</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very cost-effective products, I very like.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Shaves as close as I need.  Good build quality for the price.  Take a little more time and you can get a really close shave.</li>
    <li> Not terrible but not great at its primary purpose.</li>
    <li> It works real good on my legs.</li>
    <li> My husband, really likes it. He has never had one, shaves a lot closer than he thought and he has a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver, no skin irritation, but its not so powerful as the other brand I have.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given 5 stars, but the trimmer also is not as good as other brand shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise; its silent, compact, charges faster. Ok to buy at the discounted price (~$50), but definitely not worth the original retail price of 80 bucks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally  come to the realization that if you truly want or need a tool or a piece of equipment to do a job : SPEND THE MONEY .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $50 US you WILL NOT and CAN&#x27;T  expect this model to do the  job right .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are a myriad  of videos of youtube about this particular model showing you that it provides a clean shave but just  stop for a minute and analyze HOW LOOONG  each video &amp;#34; review &amp;#34; subject takes to perform a simple cut/shave .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRAUN, PANASONIC , REMINGTON they all know fully well that only their high end ( $100 and upwards) can actually perform well in the shortest time , YET they still offer the low end models like this piece of junk .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So , after watching more than 15 videos about this model and going through AMAZONs sub-standard shipping service ( don&#x27;t get me started about that , shopping on the site for the last  5 to 6 months have been horrendous ) I bought this and after 2 days of frustration I ended up using one of the ol&#x27; time cheap Gillette disposable razors to finish the job this P.O.S couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion : DO NOT BUY THIS . Either spend the money on the right ( high-end) models or stick to the simple ol&#x27; time razors that&#x27;s been around since before many of us were even born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERIOD.</li>
    <li> Best Braun 3 series yet. Same close shave and low maintenance like any Braun product. I like how you do not have to use the base to charge the unit.</li>
    <li> 英语&lt;br /&gt;To help a friend buy a razor, he was satisfied</li>
    <li> Good shave and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural skeptic, so I looked at some reviews before I purchased. I can tell you that it&#x27;s a great price for what you get:&lt;br /&gt;a good clean shave in 1/3rd the time it took my old Braun shaver, and less noisy. Easy as heck to clean, and I bought a spare&lt;br /&gt;cutting head for the future (after all, it&#x27;s free shipping).  For the hour it took me to read all kinds of reviews (some sounded fake, in my opinion), this is the shaver I chose, and I&#x27;m happy with it.  Yeah, I&#x27;m pretty dang picky.</li>
    <li> smoothist shave in years.  Cleans veryyyyyyyyy easy.  smooth places on my face that have never been smooth before.  yaa .</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun for 40 years. Compared to older models like 7-10 years ago, not the banana curved models of recent years (I don&#x27;t like the styling), I would say that they have less speed but more torque and that the blade assembly (blade and screen) is better, smoother when you get out of the shower still wet and hopefully will last longer but they operate fully charged only, not directly from the power outlet like older models did. I still would not use anything else although I was disappointed when many years ago they moved away from the way they were operating, shaving, imitating instead the way American brands were working, cutting your hairs.</li>
    <li> For the money this is a excellent purchase. Maybe not as quiet as a rotary but quiet enough. Don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area. Has enough power and then some. Would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing..  Best shaver I have ever had.</li>
    <li> My old Braun finally quit after I dropped it on the floor, it was 7 years old at least. After reading a lot of reviews it was an easy decision to get another Braun. Great shaver, super quiet. I expected another good shaver and I am very happy so far.</li>
    <li> Series 3-340s Wet Dry &amp; Electric Shaver Braun is very easy to use, when the sound is slightly larger, but it can be easily washed</li>
    <li> Great style and works quite well! I actually enjoy this much more than the rotating head style. This is my first mesh screen style razor and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back. Seems to get a cleaner shave with the screen than the tri-rotating head styles I&#x27;ve typically purchased.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers in the past and this one works just as well for about half the price of what I paid before for my last Panasonic.  I&#x27;ve been using the Braun for about 3 weeks now.  The main difference is the motor is a little slower than what I&#x27;m used to but the shave quality is fine.  I still do minor clean up with a regular razor but I had to do that with previous wet/dry brands as well.  Very sturdy - would recommend.</li>
    <li> The longer I keep my razor, the better I like it. So nice to get a quick shave on the way to work. Or maybe while watching TV. doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as close as a blade but I guess that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I use the Braun 340 as a wet-shaver, with a small amount of shave gel, and the results are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The 340 delivers a close and comfortable shave, in fact, the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I&#x27;ve used many different electric shavers -- Norelco, Panasonic and Remington -- and this one tops them all.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a nice weight and feel and maintenance is a snap, just rinse it after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how it performs dry because I only use it wet.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a fan of wet electric shaving, you&#x27;ll want to consider the Braun 340.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a winner.</li>
    <li> Very strong battery life, I charged the battery once about 40 days ago ,now It still works ,but the cutting effectiveness is not as good as I expected ,for the soft beards on the cheek ,it can not work very well</li>
    <li> Not good, not bad, generally meet my expectations! Simply summary: deserve the discounted price!</li>
    <li> Not good at all. Wanted to return but did not get time .. two main issues 1. Not shaving well. 2. Blades get heated so hard to use both with dry and jelly</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ll get right to the point: I was looking for a multi-groom trimmer, because I&#x27;m a guy and I like to keep everything trimmed &amp;#34;down under&amp;#34;. The trimmers I have had in the past did not do the job adequately. This trimmer works perfectly: with the adjustable blade guards on, you can remove as much of the hair as you want, and there is absolutely no pain or pulling or pinching in the very sensitive areas on a man (I&#x27;m sure the men reading this, know of what I speak). I have not used the trimmer for grooming my hair, nor do I have any facial hair, so I can&#x27;t comment on those aspects. However, for body hair trimming,  this trimmer works perfectly. And the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> Decent shave, but no where near a razor.  The skin has to be tight and without curves or it doesnt cut close to the skin.  I really am considering going back to a razor again, which is unfortunate because its so much more expensive.  But this thing just doesn&#x27;t come in the same league as even a cheap razor.</li>
    <li> very nice. I bought this Braun model based on I had the previous model for  over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it still worked but the trimmer was not sharp anymore. so based on that quality got me to  buy this  brand and model.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Just ok. It takes FOREVER to get a descent shave. I bought it for two purposes: for my daughters to shave their legs (thick, fine hair) &amp; it won&#x27;t cut their hair hardly at all! On my course leg hair it&#x27;s ok but by the time I get a semi ok shave (never smooth), I might as well have shaved with a razor. My husband uses it on his face &amp; it takes FOREVER but in the end it&#x27;s a semi smooth shave but no razor burn. He still has to go in with a razor &amp; finish off a few stray hairs. I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> A very close shave with my soft, curly beard.</li>
    <li> Works very well for the price.  Battery last through about 20 shaving sessions.</li>
    <li> One of the most useless electric razor I have ever had. Worked fine for two weeks (just outside of the 14 day return policy) then would not charge,have to send it half way across the us to get serviced. Would not recommend it anyone who wants an electric razor for more than two weeks.</li>
    <li> Patchy shave. Hard to get around the neck area so I had to use a razor.</li>
    <li> Returned - doesn&#x27;t shave closely and skips around skin surface.</li>
    <li> Read great reviews.  I completely understand its a men&#x27;s razor. However it doesn&#x27;t cut well at all. Had lite hair on leg took a lot of swipes to get it off</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby for Christmas and he said this was the best one he had used in his life, so that is almost 50 years. I would say that is a good prediction of those looking for a shaver.</li>
    <li> Except for a bit of experimenting with blades when I was in the army, I have always used electric shavers.  Most of them have been Remingtons, but I owned one other Braun several years ago.  After one shave with this one, I could not rmember why I switched back to Remington.  This shaver has given me the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had in years,  I have several &amp;#34;wild hairs&amp;#34; in my beard that grow quickly and with the Remingtons, I always had to use the trimmer to cut them down or the regular blades would just ride right over them.  The Braun cuts them right down.  Sticking with them from now on.</li>
    <li> I am really surprised that this has so many high reviews. The shaver just simply doesn&#x27;t work. I contacted Braun about it and they had no response. Very unhappy</li>
    <li> Awesome deal. It exceeded my expectations as I have never used an electric razor and thought it would be something I only used when I was pressed for time to use a blade. The reality is, this lightweight powerful electric razor has me putting away the blades for ever. I have used with and without gel and both ways get me completely shaved!</li>
    <li> good razor for daily use, it can be water washed, very convenient. and i bought two pairs of Braun Replacement Head 32S for it, and they fit each other perfectly.</li>
    <li> Shaves poorly and unevenly. Must be used in combination with razor. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> After using a Braun 5Series Activator for the past 10 or more yrs it finally wore out to the point that I purchased a Braun 3Seres 340S-4 and have not looked back. The 340S gives me a much closer shave than the Activator especially under my jaw and chin where my hair is every which way. I really love this shaver and am glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money for a 380S-4 which the only difference is a travel case and a button to depress the foil on one end (supposedly to get a closer shave under the nose, etc.) It would have cost $30 more for a feature I don&#x27;t really need. This shave gets my whole face very close and the trimmer works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> My Husband loves this shaver! A smooth shave and a great trimer Too! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had the equivalent previous model for several years and was pleased with it.  Then I accidentally dropped it on a hard floor and it though it still worked, it was not quite right, so I bought this one about a month ago.  It has been working great and I anticipate having it for many years, hopefully not dropping this one.  It gives me a close smooth shave without irritating my skin.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The foil cartridge arrived damaged and is scraping my skin. I&#x27;ve had it for less than a week. I thought Braun products had a better reputation.</li>
    <li> It works great so I don&#x27;t know what else I can ask for.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest...I bought this for my dad as a Christmas present last time.  I ended up trying it out because I&#x27;ve used razors ever since I grew hair on my face.  To my surprise, it gave an excellent close shave! It says you can use it even when your face is dry, but that just felt odd to me.  I tried it in the shower (since it&#x27;s a wet shaver too) and this thing just blew me away!  I got out of the shower, wiped my face dry, and touched my face...so smooth.  Granted, I don&#x27;t have too much facial hair anyway, but this Braun does a much better job at shaving than my regular old razor...now I want one for myself.  Oh, it comes with a small stand that also acts as the charger.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the cleaning dock in the gallery for this shaver.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. It doesnt always get a close enough shave but its good enough. I recommend changing the blades every now and then. It makes a big difference</li>
    <li> it is not as good as my Panasonic shaver</li>
    <li> good shave wet or dry</li>
    <li> Product is. Good n useful</li>
    <li> How many people were paid for their reviews on here because this razor is damned near useless. You have to go over even the finest of hairs over 20 times and it still leaves hair behind. Also while this may be related to my sensitive skin I got all red after using this. Very disappointing and I will be returning.</li>
    <li> I dont speak english well.&lt;br /&gt;It works good</li>
    <li> Great close smooth shave and long charge life.  Only issue is the new clear plastic shaver head cover supplied instead of zippered case that doesn&#x27;t really stay securely on. Use your old Braun zipper case which is no longer included when traveling.  Wish they still made the very compact model.</li>
    <li> very good , i  like this</li>
    <li> Not effective for me. Very noisy.</li>
    <li> This is quite an awesome shaver. My elderly father uses it by himself in a nursing home setting. Gives him an excellent shave. Threw away his other big name shaver because it sucked.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Doesn&#x27;t give a super close shave but is adequate.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this razor as a travel razor. However, when I am in a rush and don&#x27;t have time for&lt;br /&gt;my normal wet razor shaving, I use this one.  It does not have the special cleaning system of some other&lt;br /&gt;higher level razors, but I didn&#x27;t want that anyway.  I highly recommend this razor either for casual or&lt;br /&gt;emergency use.</li>
    <li> it is everything I expected and more!  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as good as my old 7505 series Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving with Braun products for many years and this model is a slight disappointment.</li>
    <li> My last electric was an old Remington that had too many things wrong with it to repair. Maybe it was just too old and beat up for a fair comparison, but this Braun is such a huge step up,  that by comparison, I must have been shaving with something from the stone age. I&#x27;m usually not a five-star kind of reviewer, but I can&#x27;t think of a reason why this Braun shouldn&#x27;t get them all. Really, really pleased with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some places I had some trouble shaving, but for the most part it shaved really close.</li>
    <li> It works well enough, however like others have mentioned do not skip a day shaving or you will regret it.  Any facial hair that has grown longer than a day has been mercilessly tugged/ripped out of my face by this thing as I&#x27;m shaving.  When consistently used it provides a good overall shave for an electric razor.  Seems like it has trouble in areas where my hair grows thicker such as my chin and upper lip so I usually avoid shaving those with this razor without going over those areas about 5 times with the precision trimmer.</li>
    <li> Have to go over the same area again and again and again, get the idea.</li>
    <li> good ^^.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you~</li>
    <li> The product is very good, very good to use</li>
    <li> Best shaver and value anywhere. The batteries are great and last for many years.The trick is to always have sharp blades and clean them often(I use rubbing alcohol). Just buy a new blade/head every 1 or 2 years and you will have great shaves at a much lower cost than buying a new shaver every few years when the blades get dull. I have owned nothing but Braun for 30 years, with shaves that do match a blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all who have read my reviews....this product gets my highest rating(along with Bosch tools!).</li>
    <li> Read some good reviews about this razor and the elimination of ingrown hair issues. I tried it for about a month and continually get ingrown hairs on my chin  that hang around for days. The most disappointing part is that you can&#x27;t return this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried shaving with a safety razor as well, and that also didn&#x27;t help the issue. My face just doesn&#x27;t agree with the razor apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s certainly a high quality product. Easy to clean, works in the shower, and probably a decent buy if you don&#x27;t have issues with ingrown hairs/zits etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - After six months, the razor will no longer turn on. It appears water got into the components and fried it. If I can get this replaced by Braun, I probably won&#x27;t use it for wet shaving again.</li>
    <li> Portable, light, quick charge, close, professional shave. Easy to clean. I absolutely love it! I had a Braun that I bought more than 15 years ago and it still ran great. I&#x27;m looking forward to many years w/this one!</li>
    <li> I went with recommendations for the pre-shave Lab Series. Together these two products make daily shaving irritation free, quick,clean and smooth</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s third Braun razor in many, many years.  He just keeps getting the same brand razor because he likes everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;It gives him a close shave.  The trimmer works very well.  He likes the agronomical design. It was a great price as opposed to brick and mortar stores.</li>
    <li> Prices are cheaper together performance is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric shaver.  It works very well and seems to be built very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Nice, clean shave- better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Left patchy spots, was not as expected</li>
    <li> Razor does a pretty good job but doesn&#x27;t do that good of a job under the chin or neck.  It&#x27;s just a razer, nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> gets very close without leaving razor bumps in my path</li>
    <li> been using braun for the last 15 years,last shaver I had been using it for about 4 years, so their product last a long time, got this one on sale for xmas and it&#x27;s worth every penny, feels very light and it gives me the closest shave I had so far with less passing</li>
    <li> nice machine perfect, all items from broun still very good, we recomended all products, all family have one of differents broun in home</li>
    <li> The Very best Shaver I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I am a 45 year old guy who has never been able to shave every day.  I usually shaved once a week with the typical 5 blade razor and shaving cream.  If I tried to shave every day, my face would break out and I could not stand the pain of shaving it every day.  I just started a new job where a clean shaven face is an unspoken rule.  I knew the old stand by manual razor was not going to work.  I started looking for an electric razor to use.  I spent time researching on line to see what I wanted to get.  I knew I wanted a braun but was not sure which one.  I chose the 340-S because of the lower price and the fact that it is a wet dry shaver.  I have had it a week now and have shaved every day but yesterday.  The first couple of days there was some burning but really nothing that bad.  This morning was basically pain free.  As for the shave, it is pretty good.  My hair grows in multiple directions and almost in circles in some places on my face so it has been tough to get them all. I also have very coarse, tough whiskers.  I think with more time, I will figure out what I need to do to get all of them shaved and close.  The places the braun does get all the whiskers, the shave is comparable to a manual razor and shaving cream.  When I am done my face is soft and ready for the day.  What more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> Great product, very satisfied, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> It is very well shave. Good</li>
    <li> Gave it to my son for Christmas and so I&#x27;m not sure how he likes it so far ?</li>
    <li> I only shave wet, at the end of my shower. I use shaving oil, but no creams. I have a tough, fast growing beard that has a grain that goes many directions. I also shave those dozen hairs on the top of my bald head once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I used a Panasonic 8103 shaver and liked it. I maintained it properly, but it suddenly started to scrape and nick my face. It wasn&#x27;t right after changing anything either. I never figured out why it started ripping up my face, but it didn&#x27;t seem to have anything wrong with it either. It may have had to do with an old guy who lost weight and the skin is looser and thinner than in years gone by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried a Philips Norelco 1250x. It was smoother and the contour forming was better, but not that significant. I thought that the rotary action would mean it would work equally in all directions. Not really. It still only works best against the grain of the whiskers - like all shavers. It was the \\&quot;best\\&quot; at cutting of longer hairs, but the worst at making a clean line when doing so. I liked it better than the Panasonic, but after a month it quit working after a recharge. It took me a few days to get to the pain of the warranty process and when I tried it, it was working. It turns out that it is over charging and shutting itself off as a safety issue. When the charge drops down to spec, it works again. That isn&#x27;t workable, except as a backup shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had a Braun shaver before and figured it was time to try. This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s the smoothest with the fewest nicks (almost never). It&#x27;s the closest, even though the others weren&#x27;t much worse. It isn&#x27;t particularly good at long hairs, but that makes it safer for the edges. It has the best trimmer, but that isn&#x27;t saying much as most shavers have completely useless trimmers. This one is actually useful. I thought the ergonomics would be worse on this shaver, but it isn&#x27;t an issue. It&#x27;s easy to hold and use in all necessary positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, the charge would last about a week and half. It slowly dropped to a week. It turns out that the orange light for low battery gives a very generous warning time - a little too long. So the battery memory was shortening. I started letting the shaver run all the way down when the orange light came on. The battery memory has returned back to normal and I&#x27;m back to 1.5 weeks between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not tried any of these for dry shaving, so this is a wet-only review. Braun recommends shaving before cleaning, but I&#x27;ve always had the best results shaving at the end of my shower. If you shave wet, I can highly recommend this Braun 340S as the best option. Of course, your beard may be different, but it is certainly and easily the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 Months of use.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and fine hair and this shaver works really well.  You do have to contort your neck/face to get the lower neck clean.  It took a couple of days for my skin to adjust and then I supllimented with Nivea sensitive skin post shave balm.  First time eelectric shaver user.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for awhile now and am very happy with it. It holds a charge very well &amp; does give a close shave. I have not experienced any skin irritation from using it daily. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Having read some of the recent reviews I decided to take the plunge and unfortunatley for me I regret that decision.  It isn&#x27;t a bad shaver to be fair and I like the fact that it can be used when wet - however it really struggled to cope with my facial hair and in particular that around the neck region.  It was for this reason that I decided to return the shave and instead opted for a replacement in this shave http://amzn.to/1L4UcN2 which does exactly what is promised and gives you a close shave no matter what the region.  I&#x27;ve had this replacement for around 3 months now and can honestly say I havent looked back!!</li>
    <li> I received my new Braun last week and immediately fell in love with it.  I have always been a Norelco razor user and have been hit or miss with the quality.  Sometimes they work great.  I had just bought a new one about 4 months ago and already it can&#x27;t cut anything.  I finally did some research and found Braun to be highly recommended.  I purchased one here on Amazon and after charging it the recommended 4 hours I used it and was quite surprised how quickly and thoroughly it cut my stubble.  Within 2 or 3 passes it was literally smooth.  I would highly recommend this razor to anyone wanting a close shave quickly.</li>
    <li> easy to learn how to use, comfortable, recharge very quickly</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:f8e2938c12335db16461032e942b00ca]]I bought this shaver to replace my Panasonic ES8103 shaver.    This is heavier at 7.2 oz as compared to the 5.9 oz of the Panasonic ES8103. It seems like the braun shaver is heavier than it actually is.  The cut this provides is a pretty good shave, though it isn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve ever used. However, for the money paid, it does the job.    The shaver has a green light to show that there is a charge above 20% and a red light that flashes when the battery is low. Compared to other shaver, I tend to miss the LED percentages that give a more accurate idea of the charge status. However, most people this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue since you have it by the sink where you could plug it in with easy.    My biggest con of this shaver is that even with cleaning the hair out after ever 2 uses, the little hair trimmings seem to pour out when I use the razor. I&#x27;ll pick the razer off my desk and hair trimmings will fall out of it and it&#x27;s frankly quite annoying. It&#x27;s enough of a problem that I turn this new shaver into the backup of my old Panasonic shaver.    I give this a 4 star since 3 stars would probably be unfair as some of my complaints probably won&#x27;t be an issue with some people.    Pro  - good shaver  - battery life seems decently good    Con  - hair trimmings get everywhere  - a little heavier than some other razors    *If I&#x27;ve helped, let me know by hitting \\&quot;helpful\\&quot;*</li>
    <li> good shaver good price</li>
    <li> Only one month of use, but it works great. Gives a nice shave either wet or dry (I am finding I prefer wet with a little shave gel). Cleans easily. Stands up to two days of growth without a problem. Charge easily lasts the week. I was a little anxious having used Remington for nearly 20 years. This seems at least as good. Nicer pop-up trimmer than my old Remington. Very effective.</li>
    <li> It was much better than I expected. I have had for a month and I am shaving on the first charge. I had tried electric razors in the past but soon gave up on them because of skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Had Braun for 30 years.Wonderful equipment. Simple and dependable.</li>
    <li> Removed from package, turned it on and shaved.  Immediately threw away my fairly new Norelco Aquatec Triple Header.  The Braun works.  That simple.</li>
    <li> It is great! My husband loves it very much!</li>
    <li> skin allergic after use, need to be adapted.</li>
    <li> good This is very good product!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver! Used it for 3 weeks on the first initial charge! The battery lasts forever!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned another braun shaver and this one seems just as solid. Battery life is longer than I expected, but I&#x27;m sure will deteriorate over time.  So far, met or exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using this shaver! I have had a few circular bladed electric shavers in the past and did not think they worked well enough compared to a normal razor wet shave but this Braun shaver has replaced my normal razor. I think its the linear style blades that make it easier to trim hairs since you know where the cutting edges are. It has a long battery life, lasted a whole week when I was traveling and I didn&#x27;t need to charge it at all. It&#x27;s easy to clean and has a super high quality construction.</li>
    <li> This item is very good, I have had electric shavers before, but never seems to work that well.  But I thought I would try the Braun, because I was tired of cutting myself with the regular razor, the Braun works very well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who is recovering from a stroke and has always used a blade. He likes the size and weight of this razor, and it seems to do a good job. It is easy for me to clean it for him.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this.  Does not shave near as close as I anticipated.  I do NOT recommend</li>
    <li> No thank, I like to keep my own 14 years Braun.(model 6225)  Because my real shaver made from Germany. If the battery is worn out....then I can order a new parts and fix it by myself. Because I&#x27;m saving my money and I&#x27;m very comfortable and close shave. That&#x27;s why I like to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappoint at Braun, because all new shavers are made from China. You have no idea what happening that stuff are falling apart or missing. I won&#x27;t buy it from China. Sorry Braun...</li>
    <li> When producing an electric shaver, you want to be the best razor. This is not and not by a close shave which is the problem with this razor. I have used a Norelco for years but when it died I switched to a blade and shave four times a week. I now have to shave daily and decided to go with the Braun. Not only did I not have a close shave, it wouldn&#x27;t get the neck hair at all. And yes, I held the razor at a 90 degree angle to my face. I tried a dry shave, wet shave, and even with cream. The cream gave the best results but I still had hair on my neck when done. I guess it&#x27;s back to Norelco.</li>
    <li> Goog product. Excellent brand. Recommended&lt;br /&gt;The support of a good brand is a guarantee. The size is ideal for carrying.</li>
    <li> I am bald so I wanted a razor that I could shave face and head.  The Braun 3-340 works great.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. He is partial to Braun anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought I would like it because I could use shaving cream with it, I have always used a razor and shaving cream because thats what I have done since I started shaving. To my surprise I actually prefer to use the electric shaver without cream, seems to do a better job that way. Think of it this way, if you are taking the time to lather up with shaving cream you might as well continue to use a regular razor and cream because your not saving any time.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, good price.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, it works ,perfect!</li>
    <li> My husband Loves this Razor I bought him for Father&#x27;s Day.  He says it&#x27; better than any electric razor he&#x27;s ever tried or owned; even more expensive brands/models ...  It cuts very close and smooth and takes very little time or effort.  He uses it two or three times a day for &amp;#34;touch up.&amp;#34;  I think he just likes having a new toy.  I&#x27;ve never seen him get so excited or use his other electric razors this much ..... The price is very competitive and I like the two year warranty.  From my research it appears that Braun has very good customer support to go along with the two year warranty.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I had a Braun 8000 series that lasted me a good 15 years before it literally fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is pretty decent. Cleaning it is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like is that it will not function while it is charging. Also cannot figure out why the area where you charge it has 3 prongs, yet the charger cable that comes with it only connects to 2 of them.</li>
    <li> Does not sha ve at all well.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money. Does great on one day&#x27;s growth. And no skin irritation. I did expect to like this but hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver in 30 years.</li>
    <li> Very poor shave. Leaves patches everywhere. Had to go over areas multiple times and it still would miss hairs. The neck is the worst, it doesn&#x27;t do very well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for nice design but it doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it would be a much quicker alternative to shaving my legs with a regular razor.  I&#x27;ve never used electric razors before and was highly disappointed in this.  I did not get a close shave and it took 3 times as long.  My husband will be able to use it when he&#x27;s home from work without having to pack his more expensive razor back and forth.  So ladies, for now- stay with the old stick razors- they are faster and a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It seems as good as the 8000 series I had for years.  You don&#x27;t need to spend money on cleaning cartridges</li>
    <li> I have 2 of them and they work very well.</li>
    <li> Misses lots have to go over an over an over, never again...</li>
    <li> Much more silent than my old braun with wetable feature</li>
    <li> Great shaver, good value! I was in doubt if I would buy this or the one with a self-cleaner. I can keep this one clean brushing regularly and also washing the head with boiling water, not a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;I had a simpler model before, also from Braun. This one makes a good job, and it is fast to shave.</li>
    <li> This product is superior in every way. I have used Braun for years, and decided to upgrade for a closer shave, and this product exceeded all expectations. I used to shave twice a day and still looked like I had not done so, and then I used this razor, and now I only have to shave once a day, and this is the smoothest I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who wants to purchase a quality razor without the extras. This one recharges fast, and holds the charge a full week with no problem. The battery life light is very useful!! I have nothing negative to say about this razor.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this product. Nice basic razor.</li>
    <li> It is pretty good for the price</li>
    <li> Would give it negative 100 stars if I could. Received this new and it couldn&#x27;t even shave a single hair. Terrible. Would never recommend.</li>
    <li> As expected, it runs with more noise, but works better than Philips.</li>
    <li> gave it as a gift to a friend and he likes it</li>
    <li> good!! great!!&lt;br /&gt;i love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a really good product.</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;Works great!  Gives a nice, clean shave.  The trimmer works as it should.  Battery lasts pretty long on a single charge. It looks good and feels right in my hand.  Auto voltage of 100v to 240v makes it suitable for travel.  Can be used dry or with shaving foam or gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;The triple cutting system (a trimmer in between 2 foil shavers) takes getting used to.  Although it shaves quite nicely, it feels unusual on my face.  I have to shave at an angle when I prefer to use just the foil shaver and not the trimmer in the middle.  Also, because of the triple blade design, the shaver head is pretty bulky.</li>
    <li> Shake violently, but shaving is very clean, there is a chance to get caught in the beard, so.</li>
    <li> the product used and dirty arrived at the top, I had to wash it with hot water to feel calm.</li>
    <li> Great shaver overall. I don&#x27;t think the pop up trimmer is as good as my Remington one but I do like the actual shaver and the stand up charging station that my Remington didn&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> only used once, but good so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a week now.  This razor is much quieter than my previous Remington razor which made a lot of noise.  It has a great gripability and it is better at catching some of those longer hairs on my neck.  It does seem like this one doesn&#x27;t have the same amount of power as my Remington as it takes more passes with the razor to get a good shave.  No regrets as the quiet is well worth it (I can now listen to the radio while I shave).</li>
    <li> Excellent....good power</li>
    <li> Have had this for about 3 weeks.  Great razor for the price.  This is the third Braun electric razor that I&#x27;ve owned.  The only reason why I replaced the other 2 was them not holding a charge.  I think they averaged about 12 years before replacing.  Let&#x27;s see if I can say the same with this one.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco with rotary heads, gives a much closer shave..</li>
    <li> Great shaver. I use it daily and it works great.</li>
    <li> It is light in weight and quiet and does not take up much space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would like it better if the light came on when fully charges</li>
    <li> I use the product and shave every other day. I don&#x27;t seem to get as close a shave as I had expected. I have been using for several weeks. What I do like is the trimmer. It works good around my beqrd and mustache. My old Remington seemed to give a closer shave,however.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, I use it to shave my head, I also shave my face, but I still use the gillette once in awhile on my face.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic shaver. This is my first electric shaver. I was tired of cutting myself accidentally once every few weeks using disposable razors and decided it was time to shave in the 21st century. I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Extremely close shave, as close as a new disposable razor without the risk of nicks.&lt;br /&gt;* Wet or dry. Works great with a tiny bead of Edge shaving gel which I put on the foil before using.&lt;br /&gt;* You can press as hard as you like and it will never cut you.&lt;br /&gt;* Very well designed. Feels sturdy in the hand. The charging base is compact and light, yet feels stable.&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to clean the head, easy to replace the head when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;* Cleverly designed foil head. The outer foils shave the stubble while the center part of the head cuts the longer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;* Convenient trimmer on the side for any remaining stragglers and tidying up sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;* Comes with a protective cap which is convenient for travel.&lt;br /&gt;* The battery life is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;* High speed shaving elements for a quicker shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s a little heavy, but that contributes to the solid feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly preferred this shaver to the Panasonic rotary shaver I tried.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave good and take very long time to feel the result, I just start using this brand at the time , but I have good experience with different brand</li>
    <li> My dad is happy with this gift.</li>
    <li> Great price! Perfect!</li>
    <li> This type is good enough for me.</li>
    <li> really like this razor had a Norelco before but this Braun shaves me faster and closer I am very happy with my purchase of the Braun</li>
    <li> Great shaver!! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have tried many shavers in my 50+ years of shaving. This one works the best! Great shave very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> unless you are shaving a peach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it after one shave.  It couldn&#x27;t even shave the stubble on my neck.  Took almost 20 minutes.  That&#x27;s crazy!  I bought it to save time.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor. It feels solid in the hand and gives a pretty close shave. I have a pretty thick beard and no electric razor shaves me as closely as a blade, but this one does an acceptable job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve mostly used it dry, but have used it wet and it works fine both ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note on the trimmer function: when the trimmer slides up, it only cuts on one side.</li>
    <li> The best razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 20 times and already the blades are dull. I&#x27;m back using a razor, but keep this charged for the trimmer. Just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good price.</li>
    <li> So I just got it yesterday and I was pretty excited to try it out because I have always had problems with blade razors, I always get cuts no matter how much gel I use or how easy I try to go. After using this shaver (also with a shaving gel) today I honestly didn&#x27;t get a single cut and for a guy with a light beard like me it was a pretty close up shave pretty similar to the one I get using Gillette. One thing I dislike but I am sure why it happened yet is some redness on my neck, now I have read on previous reviews that it this happens after the first time you use it but I will have to use it again and see to say myself. I would also like to mention that I have a pretty sensitive skin, every time I use the Gillette I get some I don&#x27;t know what to call it rashes? and this is one of the main reasons I am trying electric razors and until now I didn&#x27;t get any so we&#x27;ll see. I really like the build of this razor it&#x27;s kinda, it feels really rugged in hand. 60$ well spent.</li>
    <li> 1st best seller! good!</li>
    <li> Hand very fast, my father like it very much</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice Price.</li>
    <li> Not that much good to use. Not that clean takes longer time to make it clean than the others.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift to my father, it works a little noisy,but works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun Shavers for nearly 20 years and have always found them to be a good product.  My last shaver decided it was time for retirement and quit.  I ordered a new 3Series 340S-4 and this is by far the best shaver that I have used.  It gives a very close shave without the burn.  I hope that this last for the rest of my time as I doubt it can be replaced.  Thank you Braun.</li>
    <li> best price!!! thank you</li>
    <li> It works great I need a new one and the price was right. Charged it and when time for a shave it was ready and I like the trimmer also. The replacements are at a good price. You wont go wrong with this unit.</li>
    <li> It is really not a pleasant story. When I received the second one, I found it was from Wal-mart with a much lower price. What a fool I am</li>
    <li> This is a good electric shaver. The battery life is great. Not as close a shave as I&#x27;ve gotten from my previous Braun shavers but very good. This one (3rd Braun I&#x27;ve purchased) was much cheaper that the last one.</li>
    <li> Razor performed as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Had to purchase an adapter plug to use the 2 pin American plug.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with product</li>
    <li> good！！amazon is great！</li>
    <li> Good use especially can be used in the shower.</li>
    <li> The battery lasts forever, and that is a huge plus. When I first purchased it the blades would cut my hairs nicely, but now it seems to be having a hard time on a few scraggly hairs. The fact I can use it in the shower makes it worth the price though. Fairly quiet for a shaver.</li>
    <li> Shave close and has been very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Always been a big fan of Braun foil shavers.  I owned many of them.  They are the only brand that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation on my facial skin. Panasonic and to a less extent Remington irritates my skin. Sometimes I  can see reddish spots on my skin after a close shave with the Panasonic.  With my Braun I have never notice such irritations no matter how many times I go over an area with it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways more to this specific shaver and what makes it fantastic.  This new shaver now has a trimmer blade in between the two foils.  Before, if you beard is long you have to use the side trimmer to cut it short and then use the foil to shave it clean. Now I use the the foil/trimmer on top to do one shave and be done with it.  On top of that the battery last a very long time on a single charge.</li>
    <li> Much better than Philips.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. But not perfect. I allwise have to finishing the shave with a regular shaving knife</li>
    <li> Purchased this same model in the past about 3 years ago, and recently purchased one for my dad. It&#x27;s affordable, gets the job done and the replacement cartridges are easy to source. No complaints really!</li>
    <li> It is OK.  I have only used it for dry shaves.  It takes a lot of passes before I am finished.  Therefore, it takes longer to shave than with a straight razor.  Also, I always find after finishing shaving that there are places where I needed to go over again.  Perhaps when doing a wet shave things will go better.  The battery holds a charge for a long time before recharging.</li>
    <li> Tried many electric shavers over many years and none would do the job on my tough beard.  This one cost half of what my last one cost and it does a great job and does it quickly.</li>
    <li> Works well. I used foil razors in the past. I am happy with the way it shaves my beard.</li>
    <li> Im verry happy with my new shaver.</li>
    <li> And it is well used . My husband likes. Is an essential item for men.</li>
    <li> My father likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Close shave, and the trimmer works well.  Nice solid feel.</li>
    <li> great razor, would buy again</li>
    <li> My beard is not very heavy, but this razor doesn&#x27;t cut worth a darn!!  A waste of money.  Do NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this shaver by my barber but it&#x27;s simply not remotely usable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started to shave my head bald - thought this would be a good razor to use in&lt;br /&gt;the shower for that purpose.  (my head is already bald, just not &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34;).  Even with&lt;br /&gt;a 99% bald head, it simply does hardly any cutting of the stubble.  Not talking HAIR,&lt;br /&gt;just &amp;#34;5-O&#x27;Clock shadow&amp;#34;.  To get any cutting to happen, you have to PUSH and I&lt;br /&gt;mean push HARD.  And then you&#x27;ll end up with red marks everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this shaver at all.  tried it on my face and same result - virtually NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now shave my head with a plain old Gillette Fusion razor and get the result I want.</li>
    <li> On the positive side, the razor appearance is very nice, and it has an ample charge system.  However, it does not give the close shave I came to expect from a modern razor. I have to go over under neck areas, etc a few times.  If I had purchased it locally, I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> As good as my expensive Panasonic, if not better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned (and still do) many electric shavers: Panasonic, Norelco and Braun. This one give me the best shave of all . .. by far!</li>
    <li> I have used it once now. The shave is almost as close as a razors. Love it.</li>
    <li> Works good, however, it appears it will not run while plugged into AC power.  This will be an issue once the batteries start getting weaker.  My last Braun shaver still works fine but the batteries are getting old.  With the previous unit, when the batteries get low I can just plug it in and shave.  I suppose Braun would say this is a safety feature to prevent shock if used in the shower.  Of course, the shaver&#x27;s usable service life will be reduced and you&#x27;ll get to buy a new one, or new bateries...good luck with that.</li>
    <li> This razor is grate, I have had to Braun before&lt;br /&gt;340s-4 is best one yet.I can go two days without&lt;br /&gt;Shaving pick razor clean as whistle</li>
    <li> will not work on my beard</li>
    <li> I stand by the notion that the best shave you&#x27;ll ever get is a straight, manual razor. However, since I hate having to cut my face to hell everyday and deal with buying expensive replacements every so often, I figure I&#x27;d give an electric razor a chance. It took me a while to determine which was better, a foil or a rotary, and I ended up going with foil cause it cuts closer and is irritation free (for me at least). I bought this foil razor after reading a lot of reviews, because for the cheap price, it had pretty high ratings. It looks sturdy, feels sturdy, and is definitely not loud. The trimmer is pretty nice too, and I definitely advise using that first on your hair if you more than stubble growth, otherwise you&#x27;re in for a painful ride. I&#x27;ve used this both dry, wet, with foam, in the shower, and it&#x27;s wonderful, but I will say the absolute best shave I got was with foam. After shaving with this thing and shaving gel, it was exactly like a shaved with a straight razor, except with half the time and discomfort. Shaving dry is nice, but you can just see a bit of shadow on your face, but it all depends on the kind of facial hair growth you have. Battery life is....as expected? I shave every single day in the morning for about 4-5 minutes with this thing, and i&#x27;ll have to recharge it by the end of the week, assuming I started on Sunday. For me that&#x27;s no issue, and the charging takes a mere 1 hour, so it&#x27;s barely an inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Highly recommend, if you have doubts, no worries, this thing is worth the money. Though be sure to keep tabs on this one, cause the price fluctuates between 59.99 to 49.99 and sometimes they give coupons for it too. Enjoy the product!</li>
    <li> This is the best deal for any shaver.  I have owned the expensive ones $200 plus and this is exactly the same item, but at a quarter of the price.  Buy this one over the expensive models and you will not be disapointed.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this since his birthday early in the year (2013) and it works like a champ.  Very pleased with the performance and durability.</li>
    <li> Moved to a Panasonic after my last Braun and now back to Braun.  It is very comfortable, quiet and lasts up to two weeks on a charge.</li>
    <li> Gives a very nice and close shave. This is my first Braun razor (I have had several electric razors) and I am converted to this brand. Close shave. Feels more durable. Only downside is that it is a little bit loud. I like the stand and that it comes with oil for the blades.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! Product solid, good Braun Shaver. I&#x27;m pleased!!!</li>
    <li> I got his as a gift for my husband and he was really happy with it. It doesn&#x27;t cut him like some of his other razors and we were happy with the price</li>
    <li> Nicely constructed unit but only got one good shave.  The shaving head dulled quickly and takes twice as long to shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco electric razors for years. Lately, the replacement heads are as much as a new razor from a different manufacturer; such as this Braun. The economical, or third party heads, are not as good as the original Norelco heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor and paid less for it than for a replacement head for the Norelco!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dubious about its performance, I was surprised that it cut my shaving time by about one third! Possibly because of the length of the cutting heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the shave is near perfect, but the heads are new of course. Time will tell the tale, however the new heads for this shaver are considerably less expensive than for the original equipment Norelco shavers. Or, you could just buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> very good,very clean.fast</li>
    <li> I love it. This is good product. Perfect!</li>
    <li> fast sand.&lt;br /&gt;i will go had</li>
    <li> Made a great gift! It has a classy design and gets a very close shave!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver....the cut is as good as using a bladed razor.</li>
    <li> Husband likes it but says it&#x27;s kind of awkward in some spots.</li>
    <li> Smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Pretty good！！！！I bought this for my friend and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Worked until the top came apart in my hands while cleaning, and for the life of me, I can&#x27;t get the shaver back together.  Very frustrating.  Just missed the 30 day warranty, so it can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
    <li> Having used a regular razor for many years, I thought that electric razors were never able to get as close a shave as a bladed razor. One day while shaving and cutting myself for the upteenth time, my wife decided to bring home an electric rotary razor for me to try,needless to say I was unimpressed and disappointed. Back to the store she went,but this time returning with the Braun Series 3 foil shaver. Expecting the same results with the previous rotary shaver,I charged it up and the next day tried it out. WOW...this thing is absolutely amazing I thought. I never imagined that getting a close shave with an electric was possible until now. Goodbye manual razors forever ! I also bought some of the Remington Shave Stick and found that these two products work well together providing a smooth,close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Less than two months and this saver lost a center post with spring that activates the center cutter. I can not use this shaver anymore and Amazon only allows 30 days for this item to be returned. So I&#x27;m stuck. Braun is supposed to be an responsible brand. Very surprised and disappointed.</li>
    <li> Feel good, a little big noise at work</li>
    <li> Have had it for a short time, but it&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. I can heartily recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good close shave and great battery life. Unfortunately, the foil is very thin when compared to higher end shavers and damages very easily.  Plan to handle it very gently, as any small bump or bounce can ruin the foil and render the shaver unusable.  Replacement heads are available, and at the time of this review cost about $25.  In the long run, you may end up paying the price of a higher end shaver to keep this one running.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shaver and i like it, it could shave clear, and you can use about two weeks with one charge, if it work with lower sound will be much more better.</li>
    <li> Does a good job; slower than I expected</li>
    <li> I found the Braun Series 3-340 to be an excellent shaver. It gives a fast, close shave that duplicates my experience with my more expensive Series 7 model. I recommend this model.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver. I use it to shave my head and never had a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I have a moderate beard; so I am most interested in the trimmer. This does work fine. I remain a little concerned because the trimmer on my previous 3 came apart. Oh, yes. The shaver does appear to work fine on the few non-bearded areas of my face &amp; neck.</li>
    <li> This thing shaves as close or closer than a real razor.  It takes a little longer because it saves so close and the hair has to be shorter for it to cut it but it is awesome.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my legs. Much better than a woman&#x27;s shaver: sturdy with a long battery life. The sideburns attachment is great for when I go too long between using it.</li>
    <li> The Braun is comfortable to use as it fits my hand well. It is cleaned with soap and water, a definite plus. The only minus&lt;br /&gt;is the shave it gives is hit and miss. Sometimes after shaving I can still feel stubble and this is not good. I have a&lt;br /&gt;difficult face to shave closely and this shaver leaves just a bit to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;I would give a positive recommendation with the caveat that its not the absolute best shave.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, nice shaving</li>
    <li> Excellent for me. Unique machine that care my skin</li>
    <li> Price was a factor in choosing this Broun shaver. Wet &amp; Dry ? I was curious to find out how it worked. It is good, especially to clean it, just a few pass under water and zip, all clean. I usually shave dry. One charge may hold 5 good shaves, not a full 7 day week as advertised. It gives a close enough shave, but not as close as other more expensive Broun shavers I&#x27;ve owned. However I&#x27;m happy with it, It is a very good buy. // Gas...</li>
    <li> nonei am not required to comment on my purchases is you intend for me to ever buy again.  go to</li>
    <li> My grandson loves this shaver. He had trouble with chaffing on his neck from other razors. This one does not do that</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grandson.  He wanted a wet/dry razor and we were looking at them in a department store.  I didn&#x27;t like the ones they had, so I came home and got on Amazon and found a much better one and a lot cheaper too.  He says it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever used.  Says it cuts not pulls the whiskers out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchase 2 Braun 340 wet/dry shavers. Good shave considering my beard is very thick. However, both of the shavers have failed after about 12-18 months. The on/off switch on both of them broke. Luckily I found the receipt from the 2nd one. Braun claims it&#x27;s under warranty. So I&#x27;m sending it back 08/27/2012 for repair. I purchased the second on 04/16/2011. My 9 year old electric Norelco is still working, so it&#x27;s my current shaver. It too is a wet/dry shaver. However, it is not as close as the Braun. So Braun will have one chance to fix the problem or I&#x27;ll start shopping for a new shaver. Quality of both Braun shavers are similar however, the craftsmanship and longevity is less then desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to review as of 09/13/2012. August 27, 2012, I mailed back both Braun Shavers with a note to Braun that they both had the same problem and purchase reciept to the most recent purchase. The On/Off switch wouldnt function. I even offered to pay for the repair of the older 2nd shaver. Well today, FedEx delivered two (2) brand new Braun 340-s Wet/Dry shavers. No charge for either.  Braun replaced both of them. Thanks Braun for the replacement shavers and let&#x27;s hope that they last a long time.</li>
    <li> this is one of the nicest electric razors I have ever owned, and I have had a few.  It will shave almost as close as a blade. It rinses nicely, is easy to hold, and is pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> I liked this for the first couple weeks I had it, but I couldn&#x27;t get a consistent close shave (especially on my neck), so I&#x27;ve switched back to a razor. I still use it occasionally and enjoy the fact that it is waterproof.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 340S several weeks ago to replace my old Japanese-made Panasonic ES8066.  I bought that between six and nine years ago--not sure exactly.  The trimmer on it has gone bad and has pinched my skin several times causing large painful bumps when shaving my neck.  Otherwise it still works pretty well though the battery-life is about half what it was when new.  I have definitely gotten my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the designs of the current Panasonics and they are no longer made in Japan.  So, I considered buying either this Braun or a Philips AT830 as a replacement.  The Philips costs about $15 more than what I was able to buy the Braun for in local stores (not Amazon).  I have never owned a Philips shaver.  I like their quietness but doubt one would shave as close as a foil shaver.  And, the head design would make it more difficult to shave precisely around my goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Braun shaver that was heavily marketed about ten years ago.  It was compact for travel and I initially liked the design.  But, it was not a good shaver.  It had a single cutter and was like trying to mow your entire lawn with a string trimmer.  There was just not enough cutting area.  The battery was wimpy.  It could be used while plugged in, so that helped negate the battery problem.  It only lasted a little over a year.  In spite of this, I decided to go with the Braun 340S given their 60-day trial period.  I have only used the shaver dry.  If I wanted to shave with the muss and fuss of gel or foam, I would just use a blade.  Mostly I use soap and water to do an extra good cleaning of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my workhorse Panasonic, the Braun&#x27;s motor runs slower.  This gives the impression of being weaker.  However after a week of shaving one side of my face with the Braun and the other with the old Panasonic with a new foil my impression is the Braun may shave slightly closer.  Shaving time seems about the same.  I think the Braun gets neck hairs better.  But, you have to work at them.  I used to use the Panasonic&#x27;s trimmer for my neck before it quit working properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing the Braun foil-cutter assembly is recommended every 18 months.  Philips recommends 12 months.  Panasonic recommends 12 months for the foil and 24 months for the cutter.  These costs definitely add to your total shaving costs, especially if you don&#x27;t search for a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design of the Braun including the grip-ability of the rubber on the sides and the ridges on the front and back.  The curve of the body helps keep the head positioned properly against your skin.  The trimmer is straightforward and does a good job.  After several charges, I get up to 12 days of shaving on a charge.  Some reviews criticize the lack of a travel case for this model.  But the plastic head-cap offers good protection including blocking accidental pressing of the On Button.  If you don&#x27;t have a case, you could just stuff it in one of your clean socks during travel.  It fits well in the velvet case I still have from my old Panasonic so, for me, there is no issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I rate the Braun 340S as 4-stars.  It is as good as, but not superior to, anything I have used.  Reviews lead me to believe other shavers may be superior, e.g., the Braun Series 7.  But, for 2.5x the price of this shaver I doubt they are worth it.  A blade shaves closer but for me not enough so to be worth the fuss of lathering up other than for special occasions.</li>
    <li> Just got it one day ago. The shave is perfect. I can shave very clean. But there is a sort of weird smell coming out from blades when I shave. Sort of metallic smell. I don&#x27;t smell anything from Philips shaver that I bought last time. Only Braun has it! Other than the weird smell, everything is fine so far.</li>
    <li> I have been in the Army for 21 years.  I have shaved my face countless times with all sorts of razors.  I have watched others use electric razors and wondered if they would give the same shave I was used to with normal razors.  Within the last year or so it has been getting harder to spend the money they are asking for razors.  I have been using this Braun razor for about 2-3 months and am kicking myself for not buying one sooner.  Granted, this does not give the babies bottom shave of a normal razor, but it is very close.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my decision to buy an electric razor and I am even happier that this one was so inexpensive and works so well.  I would recommend this razor to ANYONE!</li>
    <li> really good electric razor...use it daily</li>
    <li> General performance.Not so bad</li>
    <li> Relatively good product. May not be suitable for low hair growth person...</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t cut my beard, wet or dry. Had to re-shave with a blade. I couldn&#x27;t send it back fast enough.</li>
    <li> My significant other loves it!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had any problems with the shaver, it has a smooth cut that dosen&#x27;t pull my whiskers when I am using it</li>
    <li> My husband uses this every morning saving him time and the hassle of a regular razor.  He likes it.</li>
    <li> The shaver pulls at the beard and takes way too many passes to get a smooth shave. It is taking twice as long to shave now as it did with my previous Braun. I would not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Finally replaced my old Braun shaver from almost 10 years ago, that&#x27;s still working but no longer has blades. This is a newer, and seems to be better version. Cuts easily and cuts low. Battery does as advertised and lasts a week!</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY shaver that will cut my facial hair and not make my face irritate! I listened to all of the reviews and finally understand why they were accurate. I would HIGHLY recommend this product if you have sensitive skin or any skin type really.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor, but it cannot be used as a corded razor.  I may consider changing my rating down the road depending on how long it takes the battery to stop holding a charge.</li>
    <li> The shaver foil has irregular holes instead of circular holes, and is not as good with a two day-old beard compared to my previous model. For shaving every day it is fine.&lt;br /&gt;A good feature is that the low battery warning light is easy to notice.</li>
    <li> Shave&#x27;s great waited to shave after ordering  had a few days grow when I&#x27;ve got it TRYED immediately and received a full wonderful shave face and head</li>
    <li> My battery died within 2 months.  While it was charging it heated up and then hasn&#x27;t worked since.  Note, before it died, this shaver will not work on a dead battery even when plugged in.  My 10 year old Braun shaver still works thou, so I&#x27;m back to using that one again.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors since I started shaving 20+ years ago and am comming from a 12 year old braun.  The one that took the gel cassette.  This one put it to shame, even when the old one was new.  I don&#x27;t have a very full beard and it catches all of the hair around some scars that I have on my neck.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a close electric shave.</li>
    <li> does not shave very well</li>
    <li> THANKS FOR PROVIDING US GOOD PRICE. ITS REALLY TOOO GOOD &amp; EASY TO PURCHAGE ..............................I REALLY LOVE IT...:) AMAZONE IS BEST</li>
    <li> Can be used in case of contact with water, but for me, there are some beard can&#x27;t clean up, and charge to use time is not too long.</li>
    <li> Like the 3 series better than the 5 series I have......it is lighter and shaves just as well and is less expensive.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase the Braun Series 3 as I&#x27;ve always been a blade man but when a pack of my favorite blades hit $30 at the drugstore I decide to give it a try. This razor definitely takes a few days to get used to but I am glad I stuck with it.  At first, the friction caused some irritation and it didn&#x27;t seem to give me a very close shave particularly on the neck. I got around this by using it in the shower with some shave cream which greatly improved the experience. The irritation stopped occurring after a couple weeks and now I mainly use it dry with no problem at all. It gives me the freedom to shave on the go, is fairly quiet and easy to clean.  Plus I am getting 4 - 5 shaves on a charge which is better than expected. The shave is not quite as close a blade but really not much of a difference. Overall happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Just a little preface - I am 31 years old and have I shaved with a Gillette Mach 3 razor since I was about 16.  I do not have a cousin IT style beard, I grow with regular facial hair thickness/coverage on my chin and upper lip but I have spotty hair growth on my cheek and jaw line area. Typically, I would shave every other day with my manual razor but I have grown tired of nicks, cuts and the occasional razor burn leading me to try an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the Braun 3-340s, I have really enjoyed shaving with the razor. I was apprehensive at first not knowing what to expect or how to really shave with the electric razor. I read over the manual while I let the charger fully charge for 4 hours. The razor exceeded my expectations, it provides a nick free close shave with minimal effort. I have shaved with the electric razor dry each time without any shaving cream and the shave is almost as close has my manual razor but the elimination of shaving cream, cuts, nicks, red spots etc is more than worth having not as close as a shave. I don’t mean by not as close that I have stubble or I am unhappy but you do not get the same level of smoothness as you do with a manual razor because the electric razor is cutting just your facial hair and not also removing a tiny amount of skin with each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved three days in a row for about 5-7 minutes each time and the battery is still strong. Your battery life will be reflective to the thickness of your beard and how often you shave. The razor is easy to clean, I pop the head off, knock it against the sink a few times, brush the body (not the head) and I am good to go. I will every three days clean the razor with a little hand soap to keep it nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am extremely happy with the razor and I doubt I will go back to a manual razor again. Getting this shaver for $50 was well worth the money and I would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the razor!the razor!</li>
    <li> The razor works fine but does not work in the series 3 cleaning station.</li>
    <li> I use both rotary and foil shavers , and this Braun actually performs pretty well . All electric shavers require making a few passes to get a clean shave, but ultimately you do get comparable results to a blade. The 340s does a great job and the price can&#x27;t be beat .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and it gives a pretty good, close shave. I still prefer the results from a razor shave but medication precludes use of a blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;So, anyway, this is probably about as good as I could expect. No complaints.</li>
    <li> works fine not a extremly close shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for a month now and I&#x27;ve got to say for $40.00, it&#x27;s not bad. It cuts pretty smooth in almost all areas, though it&#x27;s tough to get areas like my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does hold a charge VERY well, I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once since buying it. It&#x27;s a bonus that it&#x27;s 100% water friendly and you can wash it and take it into the shower.</li>
    <li> I use daily, close shave - good price.</li>
    <li> close shave and good charging system. so far the best shaver I&#x27;ve tried. if the blades stay sharp it will be my shaver of choice.</li>
    <li> I like the battery life. Easy to clean, Quiet, and charges quickly. It&#x27;s light in  weight, and comfortable, as compared to my old shaver.</li>
    <li> For this price I found it here before Christmas and everyone else was selling for $30-40 more.  Then after Christmas I saw it at Target for the same price on sale so this was a good deal.  Works wonderful</li>
    <li> It was way quieter than my earlier Braun.  A nice surprise! It doesn&#x27;t seem that it cuts as cleanly on the first pass though. It just means that I have to pay more attention to some areas- under the chin and along the neck.  I like it though and it sits in the charger kinda cool!</li>
    <li> Great razor. My husband loves it! Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave...kind of important.&lt;br /&gt;I have a 3yr old (with 3 yr old blades), $20 Sansai that clearly outshaves this product.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer works.....</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Does its job better with shaving cream or foam. It has amazing Battery life. Its a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> My husband says this shaver is everything it states it is.  He is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> When I first got this shaver, I wasn&#x27;t sure it did as good of a job as my old one.  I&#x27;ve determined it does... it is just quieter than it what I noticed.  I really like the green/red indicator telling me when to recharge the battery.  That is a great feature because I don&#x27;t like to leave it plugged in.</li>
    <li> Great Product and fast shipping. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Well~. It&#x27;s not bad. but It&#x27;s not excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is just so so.&lt;br /&gt;This can&#x27;t eraze mustache and beard completely.</li>
    <li> Best Goods. I love it.!!!</li>
    <li> Garbage, don&#x27;t waste your time with this shaver. Doesnt cut hair. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor, I haven&#x27;t used it wet yet only dry. But it does a great job for my needs. Being a Braun, I knew that it would be a good product.</li>
    <li> Since it is 220 volts,I can use it  in my Country (Uruguay)&lt;br /&gt;I recomeend this shaver machine,with its rechargable battery</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a decent razor.  Working from home means I don&#x27;t have to shave very often, so when I do, I use a blade.  I use this for business trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing to note:  It does not operate when plugged in!  This is a change from past.  Not a big deal, just remember that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shaving heads to me are a little wierd.  The middle sits a little low and it feels different from the last version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, cut is very close, as always.</li>
    <li> This shaver is nice, but sometimes I think the blade is faster for me.  It seems to not be much of a time saver to go electric unless you shave and drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can usually shave for a full week on one charge.  The shaver is well built and I like the option of using the cord or charging stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detail trimmer isn&#x27;t great and I would suggest you use a dedicated detail trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe is the cheesy plastic protective cover for the foil.  If you breathe on it wrong it falls off.  Not good when you are traveling and have this stuffed in your bag.</li>
    <li> Pretty good does leave patches if you&#x27;re not thorough though the trimmer is legit thoough</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor. I have nicked my self for the last time.  Easy to use and clean.  This is one of my grooming rituals</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I have been in the market for an electric razor for awhile. I was looking for something that is portable and have a great battery life. On a single charge, this razor lasted about 3 weeks with me shaving once every day.  The included dock and travel cover to prevent accidental operation is great. I get a very close shave with the blades. After shaving I wash the razor and the blades with soap and have no problems. The side burns trimmer is also very accurate and sharp. It&#x27;s a great electric razor with many great features for the price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a soft beard and this razor will not cut it once its more than 1/32 of an inch long.</li>
    <li> Works great and is a better value than the Model 380s-4.  I&#x27;ve had both shavers.</li>
    <li> The last time I used an electric shaver I was 15, about 14 years ago, and I HATED it. It cut me, pinched me and pulled my facial hair. I was apprehensive to buy another one. I did a lot of research on what kind of head I should get if I have very sensitive skin, especially on the neck, what features I needed, etc. I decided on the 340s instead of the 380s because I don&#x27;t need an extra 3 LED lights for battery status not do I need a head locking feature. That&#x27;s the only difference, according to what I read online. And everything online is true, right?&lt;br /&gt;It does everything as advertised but it just camp seem to get some of my neck hair. I have very sensitive skin, especially on my neck, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, even when shaving dry. It&#x27;s a great and comfortable shave. Just wish it could get the little tiny neck hairs. I would give 5 stars if it got my neck hair, which in all likelihood is not the fault of the shaver but my neck contours and how fine the very bottom hairs are.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like I&#x27;m doing something wrong when I rinse the shaver under water and it was difficult to trust in that I could do that the first time. Have tried shaving dry and with shaving cream. Both work great but when I used the shaving cream, it seemed like the shaver had a difficult time picking up some of the hairs that stuck down on my skin. Works better dry for me.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it.  Nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> does not cut as well as a Remington am sorry i purchased this razor....</li>
    <li> An excellent razor.  Charges quickly and holds the charge about a week.  Shaves closer and smoother than any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Cleans quick and easy everyday.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Shave was like a baby&#x27;s behind. So soft. Price was reasonable. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for a year now. I broke off the back plate where the trimmer is located while I was trying to clean it out. This caused the trimmer blades to come off track and was irreparable due to me snapping a plastic piece. I sent it into their customer service center and they replaced the entire back plate for free and shipped it back to me for free. Works like new!</li>
    <li> This product gives high performance for its price. You will never regret it ..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more than wonderful and I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> quick Remove beard,smooth,better than Phillips</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use an electric razor because every time I did my face always ended up very dry and/or torn up.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my skin or the razors I&#x27;ve chosen, but since I have been using the Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver I have not had ANY of these problems.  It&#x27;s super easy to clean, it charges quickly, and it fits well in my hand while shaving.  Oh, and the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. This shaver is excellent - it provides the best shave I have ever had from an electric shaver, and it comes about 90% as close as the shave I have been able to achieve with disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;2. The shaver works dry, wet (with just water), and wet (with shaving cream).  It can also be used in the shower without any risk of damage.  I found that it cuts best with shaving cream after wetting your face with warm water, but I have dry shaved with it as well and it does quite well.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is VERY easy to clean.  The directions recommend adding a drop of oil to it once a week if you clean it under water, but that is a small inconvenience for the ease of cleaning achieved by running it under water while running.  It takes somewhere between 15 - 30 seconds to thoroughly clean the head.  Ease of cleaning was one of the major reasons I had not recently tried an electric shaver, but this makes it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None that I can think of now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything i had read and heard about. Great shaver,  gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I really like. I&#x27;ll take good use.</li>
    <li> Very pleased so far. Has held a charge and shaves very close. Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I chose this razor because I needed one for a closer shave for my spouse.  I also wanted to get away from the rotary shaver as it was too hard to take apart and clean.  I saw this had excellent ratings.  The shaver gave a close shave except for a few stubborn neck hairs.  The biggest problem I had was the cleaning.  I would tap it each time and very little came out and the pieces that came out were little balls of hairs.  I took the thing apart to clean better but had a hard time getting the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; out and putting the pieces back together was not easy.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3-340 provides a pretty good shave without razor burn. I work a job that requires me to be clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;Much more silent than my old braun with wetable feature.</li>
    <li> Shaving finish is very good, the noise is slightly big, but acceptable.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price! Easy to use and does a great job!</li>
    <li> it serves its purpase</li>
    <li> It is not the best shave, by any means but for the price it just ok. would not recommend it to others</li>
    <li> Its pretty nice. It does take a few passthroughs and i would highly recommend you do a wet shave with shaving cream for the best results. i found it works better on harder surfaces, so like i get an amazing shave on my chin, but it lacks on my cheeks and even the mustache area. if you are looking for a pretty smooth shave, this is perfect for you. If you want no visible hair (black dots), then just bite the bullet and use expensive blades. I use it in the shower with some sort or shaving cream/soap, then use a mach 3 to do the mustache area. It&#x27;s a close shave if you do it like that.</li>
    <li> A great product.&lt;br /&gt;They are very well used.</li>
    <li> Not everything I thought it would be. Great wad going for much more outta this. I do love the trimmer on it, but as far as it giving a great shave, not my first go to. I actually take this one with me while traveling for work. I often stay overnight at a hotel (working on the train) and I&#x27;m not willing to loose or forget my other one.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! I use it dry in my arms and legs. Very efficient. I love it. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great. Close comfortable shave fast. Lets see how it holds up over the next year. Had my last Braun for about ten years</li>
    <li> yes, my face is very soft and honestly this shaves as close as the 4-5 blade razors.  I bought new blades for 19$ for 4 and thought wow, that&#x27;s ridiculous.  So I did a little research and bought this and am very glad I did.  Shaves extremely close, is quiet, the battery lasts for at least one week (using daily) and it has a great little trimmer for sideburns or neck hair.  If you want an electric razor, spend no more, look no more. this is it.  It also is waterproof and specifically states you can use with shaving gel/foam and or soap.  I don&#x27;t but you can, probably ladies would be interested in that.  Its much better than the braun I had 30 years ago, but not much has changed.  I guess when its not broken, braun isn&#x27;t going to fix it.  That is impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/2014:  OK, I have been using this for several months now, and thought I would update.  First off, the good:&lt;br /&gt;1- Shaves good --IF CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;2- Great battery life, (1 week plus)&lt;br /&gt;3- light weight&lt;br /&gt;4- nice charger stand&lt;br /&gt;5- easy to disassemble and clean&lt;br /&gt;6 trimmer works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is not cleaned (rinsed out with blade off), every 2 days or so, you will notice the quality of the shave declines rapidly.  It will get to the point it almost does nothing.  So its imperative you keep this cleaned out.  The other issue I have is that the trimmer is very awkward and kind of ungainly.  Its good for trimming side burns, but its almost worthless for trimming around ears or neck because of the size and angles that the trimmer is mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all for under 60$ I am very impressed and very happy.  Initially I was going to remove a star, but as I think about it, my big issue is that I need to clean it?  I mean that is a given, and how can I deduct for that.  I point it out so that you are aware of it and you keep yours cleaned vs thinking its not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my father as a Father&#x27;s Day gift.&lt;br /&gt;He said it could shave clean and rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it. So I am considering give 5 stars for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I have bought it again for my friend, and the package is on the way.</li>
    <li> The best shaver I have used so far. Completely waterproof and gets a close shave - would recommend.</li>
    <li> Quite, shaves close and very comfortable on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Charge lasts almost a full month (I don&#x27;t shave on Sat &amp; Sundays).</li>
    <li> It is very good and better than the one I am using.</li>
    <li> Let me say first, that I am a female reviewing this product. I actually think this is the best buy I have made in a long time. I have used this shaver on my legs and underarms with really good results. I have never used it wet/in the shower or with shaving cream or gel. I have always gotten the best results using it on dry skin. It cuts pretty well even when I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs in a few days. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it shaves as close as conventional razors for me, but I don&#x27;t shave my legs every day and that could definitely make a difference. On my underarms, I feel like it&#x27;s just as close as a razor. I have owed this shaver for a few months now and there is no sign of it losing power or not cutting as well. I would recomment it to any women who doesn&#x27;t like the hassle of shaving. It doesn&#x27;t give me the best shave I have ever had, but it works for me. I mean, you can shave your legs while watching tv! Who doesn&#x27;t want that?</li>
    <li> More power, less charge time and great shaving.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. I liked the high rating and decided to buy it for him. Very quiet and smooth shave.  The longer hairs on the neck are a small problem.  He says it works better than his other Braun.</li>
    <li> one of best electric shaver i used</li>
    <li> everything is working well as i wanted.</li>
    <li> Ok this is my first time I used  a electric shavers and I love it .my face is so nice and smooth</li>
    <li> Really love this Shaver.Impressive!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried it dry, wet and with shaving cream.  It won&#x27;t win any awards for a close shave.</li>
    <li> I gave this guy a college try, but this is by FAR the worst shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had in my LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the foil head smells weird right out the box.  I assume it wasn&#x27;t used or anything like that, but that didn&#x27;t exactly leave me feeling assured about the quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it in, and a few hours later, came back to the house to give it a shot.  I really should&#x27;ve taped this, to show you HOW POORLY it cuts hair, how you have to go over the same spots OVER AND OVER.  Even when I used the trimmer to get rid of my 4 day old beard, to give the shaver the benefit of the doubt, it STILL missed hairs and leaves an uneven, irritated mess especially around your neckline.  I have irritated skin around my neck and mustache area now.  From a 5 minute shave with this garbage.  NEVER AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning this piece of crap.  I expected better from Braun.  Previously I was using a simple 20$ beard trimmer and THAT was far more comfortable than this nonsense.  I think most of the people that vote on this thing are either company shills or poor consumerist rubbernecks that haven&#x27;t ever had an actual GOOD shave in their life before (probably used to 10 cent Bics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to trimmers/razors we go.</li>
    <li> Better than my $150.00 rotary.</li>
    <li> This replaced a shaver I have had for a long time but the other set was on its last leg.  This one is average at best.  Does not give a very close shave and I only have to shave once a day.  It does not do that good of a job.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s very good! I&#x27;ve bought 4 for my friends!</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun electric shaver.  My previous one I had for many years (10+) and it finally died.  This 3-series works great, at a reasonable price here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works good in showed and with shaving jell.</li>
    <li> The razor has done a very good job on my beard. Great electric razor I would recommend the purchase if you are looking for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> Had one to two days delivery but it took seven days to get to me after three phone calls.  think I should have went the next step up cause the razer  doesn&#x27;t cut real well. but if you spend the time it will give you a pretty nice shave.</li>
    <li> After the cutting head wears, replace it with the better designed and manufactured replacement head.</li>
    <li> Use the Braun 340s in the shower. Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used - and for less than $40. The battery is very good - can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  It&#x27;s impossible to get a better shave for the cost of this razor!  It&#x27;s not my first Braun razor and definitely will not be my last.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s gift for dad,pretty good.</li>
    <li> Very good item and seller, Thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;SO nice</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty unreasonable to expect any electric razor to give a close shave in a pass or two; manufacturers can&#x27;t possibly know how fast a &amp;#34;pass&amp;#34; will be, or at what angle whiskers are growing. One always has to do many passes over cheek or neck from different angles to get a very smooth result. That&#x27;s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic user for 11 years. Have always gotten a very close shave. First one lasted 3 years. Last one has lasted 8 years...and without changing any foils or blades! (And my beard is no softer than anyone&#x27;s.) So Panasonic has been good value for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Panasonic has gotten incredibly expensive, and they all have &amp;#34;arc&amp;#34; shapes which is opposite what a face needs...and they went down the &amp;#34;ultra high rpms&amp;#34; road, which I believe is wasted wear and tear...not to mention loud. 13,000 new whiskers can&#x27;t possibly find themselves into the same foil hole in a second&#x27;s time. At most a dozen, and likely far less. So a couple hundred rpm ought to be more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was part of my theory when I went looking for alternatives to the Panasonic price tag. I&#x27;ve tried rotary models (Norelco) which work quietly but don&#x27;t give nearly as close a shave (although they do the job enough to go to work and such). And I&#x27;ve tried a Remington foil model, but found that Remington gets their money not up front but on foil replacements--the foil warps and then tears/breaks after 3 months.  Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this time I tried Braun. Didn&#x27;t need any fancy clean-and-lube features (skin has a little oil on it anyway). This Braun 340s is very nice. Much quieter than the Panasonic, slower speed, low-frequency rumble...but the shave is just as good. Could even be superior, although I&#x27;m comparing a new Braun to an 8-year-old Panasonic. Still, it takes me no longer to shave than it ever did. Braun says their foils have hole openings that aren&#x27;t uniformly round, and that probably helps the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An admittedly bizarre-sounding side benefit which no one ever mentions is that the low rumble vibration of the Braun is low enough frequency that your face can feel it. It&#x27;s a bit like a face muscle massage (compared to the Panasonic). Sounds ridiculous? Yeah, well, the face has a lotta muscles, believe it or not; keeping them &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; and flexible has been shown to keep a face from sagging and making a guy look like a 100-year-old basset hound before he&#x27;s all that old. If I care enough to want to shave, I care enough to not have jowls before my time. The Braun feels good on the muscles. (I don&#x27;t know, maybe I need it because I grimace too much.) For what it&#x27;s worth....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Braun shaver has a solid, durable feel to it. Has a small charging stand that&#x27;s all you need. Seems to charge quickly. The side-burns/moustache trimmer is superior to the one on my Panasonic. It&#x27;s just as easy to dump whiskers out of the Braun. And (sorry to be so graphic, but) the whisker dust is a lot less fine, courtesy once again of the lower frequency. You can see the diff very easily.  And there&#x27;s a lot more of it when it&#x27;s dumped out--which means my Panasonic was chopping whiskers into a dust so fine it was losing that dust out the foil holes...onto the bathroom counter, my shirt, etc. I never knew it until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I like the Braun a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t speak about how long the battery, foils or blade will last, as I&#x27;ve only had it about a month. Feels durable. Since you can also get a better deal with a Braun,  I expect this 340s to give me equal (maybe superior) value to the Panasonic models I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my Panasonic&#x27;s battery was still lasting through a full shave every day (which it wasn&#x27;t), I wouldn&#x27;t have shopped for a Braun. But if, like me, it&#x27;s time for you to consider a new razor, I&#x27;d recommend this Braun 340s. Good machine.</li>
    <li> You will love this razor.  Had the first model for 6 years, now enjoying this one as much.  Clean the razor head often it will pay off with a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Works Real good, gave me a great shave.</li>
    <li> Simply put - best shaver I ever owned.  Glad I just pulled the trigger and bought it.  You won&#x27;t find a better shaver for $50.</li>
    <li> very good， I will buy again！</li>
    <li> Awesome ... years ago I had another brand rotary shaver and never liked it ...  have a small battery Braun for backpacking always loved it... Since I am into the &#x27;scruffy&#x27; look when I shave every few days  up to a week  it has become difficult with manual blades clogging up and shaving difficult.  Just received the new Braun 3 series .... WHY DIDN&amp;#34;T I BUY THIS BEFORE NOW!!!  Works great! Doesn&#x27;t wreck my skin... may give up scruffy for clean shaven!</li>
    <li> I like it, but the only problem is that the cutting performance is not as good as the regular blade. But still, good quality, worth the price.</li>
    <li> During the short period I had this shaver, it worked extremely well and the design was sleek. I have no idea what went wrong with it, but it crapped out on me after a few weeks. Amazon was awesome enough to refund it since it was within 30 days. Went with the 320S-4 after that since I do mostly dry shaving anyway.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Does well what is made for.</li>
    <li> If you expect to buy an electric razor and beat the closeness of a manual razor, your expectations might be too high, but this razor is capable of producing a near manual razor shave for only 50 bucks at the time of this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can run my hands over my face against the grain, and feel no stubble when used dry. It does struggle in some tight spots and needs more passes in them. My Wife took what we named the face on face test. She was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging dock works well. The plug for the wall outlet is bulky. It comes with some oil, a plastic cover, and a small brush too. No travel case or cleaning agents in case you were wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using lotion seems to feel better, but the dry shave didn&#x27;t irritate my 37 year old skin, so no need for me. The trimmer works well too. This has to be the best trimmer under $50 by far, and it beats many from 50-100 that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice looking and solidly built. Replacement heads are 20 bucks, or even less if you buy a 3 pack. That&#x27;s just another added benefit as rotary usually runs 10 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy. Just take the top off and almost all the hair comes out. Use the brush for what&#x27;s left. Wet shave cleanup seems best with vinegar or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have my Wife try it out and report back since I saw some female reviewers to confirm how well it works for them.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he really likes it.  He&#x27;s had Braun shaver&#x27;s before.  They last about 3 years with a change of heads.</li>
    <li> I have owned three shavers, first a Norelco, then a Remington and most recently a Philips. The Philips was by far the best of the three brands and gave my light beard a decent shave (I have difficulty growing a full beard, with gaps in it in my cheeks where hair refuses to grow.) Since it was time to replace the shaving screen and cutters, I went shopping for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Braun 340-S-4. I was attracted by a favorable customer review on Amazon by someone with a similary light beard growth, and also by the price ($59.95), so I gave it a try. I didn&#x27;t opt for the pricier 380-S which seems identical except for a carry case and a setting to retract two of the 3 cutter screens for shaving under the nose (my 340-S works fine under my nose with all 3 screens.) The shaver arrived, was easily charged, and I have used it for almost thirty days now. It finally glowed red on turnoff about five days ago to indicate the battery was getting low and I recharged it overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPRESSIONS: It shaved my face comfortably and remarkably close, closer than my Philips when it was new. It is quieter than any electric shaver I have used, cleans up easily under streaming water, and I air dry it overnight with the shaver screen head assembly removed. Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry completely before next use, and I was used to doing this with my old Philips.) The shaver has a clip-on plastic screen guard which also covers the power button for safe traveling (so much for needing an unnecessary plastic carry case with the 380-S) and I keep the guard on the shaver when it isn&#x27;t being used. There is a nice, lightly-weighted stand to keep the shaver upright on your counter when not being used and it has rubber tips on the bottom to keep it gripping the counter firmly. The stand also has a connector to connect the charger cord so it will automatically charge when on the stand (I don&#x27;t have a nearby outlet on my bathroom counter so I charge it in the living room when necessary.) The trimmer slides up into position with a push of the thumb and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say? Braun has made a wonderful, capable, quiet and convenient electric shaver that shaves my beard type comfortably and close. It&#x27;s priced well and I&#x27;m impressed. I haven&#x27;t tried to wet shave with it and see no reason to start.</li>
    <li> Good shave with Remington gel.</li>
    <li> Best $50 I&#x27;ve spent ...amazing shave</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my base model Norelco that needed a new head.  After a break-in period of about a week, I was pleasantly surprised at the performance of the Braun.  It shaves much closer much more comfortably and the trimmer actually works.  It holds a longer charge and allows you to finish a shave even when it&#x27;s running down.  Much better product.  Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works fine on my delicate skin.  Gives a close shave.  What more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with a cover which actually protects both the head and keeps the power switch from being activated accidentally in my luggage.  A small but useful thing.</li>
    <li> This is by far the smoothest electric razor I&#x27;ve used hands down. The product is super easy to clean and is a steal for the price. I love that you can wet or dry shave with it too! If you&#x27;re shaving everyday, it does a fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars, is the fact that if you don&#x27;t shave for a day or two, it will not give a close shave, and I generally have to use a regular razor to get all the spots its missed.</li>
    <li> Works Good. The Shaver comes with a cradle so once charged its good to go for up to 45 minutes. I never used in the shower but the instructions say you can. You can also use with foam or gels. Top pops off for easy cleaning. Its fully washable to get wet or rinse out under water. Comes with a 2 year warranty</li>
    <li> I bought it for my brother and after the 4th use it didn&#x27;t turn back on again.&lt;br /&gt;The people at soap were very kind and helped me with the return and the refund right away.  I know it is a great product but maybe it was just bad luck this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Braun products, order this one a week ago from Amazon and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s never taken me so long to shave off 24hrs worth of stubble. And I really had to press in deep just to get it half way decent. I still had to finish me neck with a regular razor. I would try something else.</li>
    <li> I have had to purchase about five or six different shavers over the last three years or so and this was the first Braun&#x27;s shaver that I have bought. I found it to be average in regards to its ability to shave me. However, after about three (3) and a half months the shaver broke on top in the middle and I have to replace it. I had gotten the impression that Braun was one of the better shavers and would give a closer shave than its competitors shavers but I did&#x27;nt find that to be the case. I found this shaver to be average and it did&#x27;nt do any better than any other razor that I have had.</li>
    <li> Literally everything I didn&#x27;t want with an electric razor. Extremely close in some areas and left rough patches in others, intense razor burn that lasted all day, and took a very long time to shave my whole face. Worst razor I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Thank you....five stars</li>
    <li> I would consider buying this product again. Great for daily used and to carry on trips. bery smooth and no stubbles after. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Works great! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Not so easy to cut the mustache on the jaw. In general, it worth its price.</li>
    <li> The razor does not do the job that I expected out of it. Weather I use wet or dry I still have to use a razor after. I don&#x27;t have a rough beard but I am one unhappy camper with this razor</li>
    <li> Excellent cutting. Easy to use both innthe shower and out. Easy to clean....fast charging. Would recommend as a good first shaved.</li>
    <li> My Norelco of, oh, let&#x27;s say 14 years because who can tell, finally started to go on me and I decided it was time to upgrade, after enveloping myself in the bevy of reviews and opinions in this apparently gargantuan electric shaving community it became clear a foil shaver would resolve my irritation issues - or so I was told. Well I&#x27;m happy to report in a time when we are constantly lied to this was not the case, the shave is much faster, very close, precise, and the attached trimmer is miles better than the rarely-used apparatus on my old one. I&#x27;ve even taken to using it for back hair and keeping the sideburns in check, it&#x27;s so good the first time I cut off more than I thought it could handle yet the trimmer sliced through the sideburn like a hot knife through butter. The sole reason I dock a star is the planned obsolescence, which is something I will always hold against a product, the reason Norelco lasted through three and a half presidential terms is the ability to use it while plugged in, thus bypassing the dead battery, Braun has chosen to gloss over this feature. I am left wondering if I can rip it apart to replace the battery, google indicates I can take it apart, but indeed it seems replacing the battery is another matter entirely and I expect Braun would devour two legs and five fingers to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with the closeness of shave, the lack of irritation, and the features of this shaver, and dissatisfied with planned obsolescence.</li>
    <li> My shaver [[ASIN:B0021AG0Z6 Panasonic ES8249S Nanotech 4-Blade (Arc 4) Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System]] that I&#x27;ve been using for the last 2 years won&#x27;t charge properly and since it was still under the warranty (22nd month) I sent it to Panasonic for replacement. I didn&#x27;t know how long it will take for me to get the replacement so I started using the disposable manual razor blades such as Gillette Fusion/Mach 3 etc. My skin probably was used to electric shavers by now and couldn&#x27;t handle the manual blades and I had so many cuts, burns and bumps from those. Plus these are expensive and a rip-off. Long story short I wanted some cheap electric shaver which would serve me for a few weeks and I thought I will try a different brand other than Panasonic to see how it compares with my original razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main criteria were -&lt;br /&gt;1) Wet &amp; dry shave - I have thick facial hair and shave daily and I prefer the wet shave, even if its just rinsing with water&lt;br /&gt;2) Foil shaver (eliminates all Norelco products) - read everywhere that foil shavers give closer shave than rotary so I&#x27;m sticking with foil for now&lt;br /&gt;3) 120-240 V for travel purposes&lt;br /&gt;4) Under $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were only a few shavers that met this criteria, among those under $50 were Braun 340S-4 and Remington F5-5800A. Braun was $48 + tax after a $10 coupon and Remington was $44 + tax. I decided to go with Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m super impressed with the shaver. When you switch it on the first thing you notice is that how silent this is compared to the Panasonic. The shave is so close and soft without any cuts, rashes or skin allergy. I feel the closeness of the shave is better than Panasonic has ever been, even when it was new, and Panasonic is rated very high here on Amazon. This shaver is essentially the same as 380S-4 (which has an additional switch for closer shaves under nose, neck etc., comes with a pleather pouch and has 3 indicators for battery charge vs. two on 340S-4). Panasonic was never good near the neck area and this Braun does so much better than Panasonic. Probably because Braun has a narrower head (3 blades) vs. the wider head of Panasonic (4 blades). Perfect scenario were less is more! It takes about 5-6 minutes for a very close shave, which also I think is lesser than what Panasonic used to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a trimmer which can be used for sideburns or moustaches but I don&#x27;t like the design and location of where it is (its on the back with a sliding mechanism) and I usually use a disposable razor for that. It also comes with a small stand where you can attach the power cord and I use it as the charger/stand. This is a major convenience for me since I was used to just putting the Panasonic back in to the cleaner/charger. The cleaners are mostly a waste and running the shaver in water with liquid soap is more than enough. There is also a plastic head cover which protects the head while traveling, but I wish it case with a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for two weeks so I can&#x27;t comment on the durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is not the same as Panasonic (well its cheaper). The power switch feels flimsy and I have a feeling it won&#x27;t last very long. Especially if you do wet shave and clean your shaver every few strokes in running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 stars. Just for that super close, soft and smooth shave! Also in the long run these are cheaper than Gillette blade refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Update May/2014 --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic sent me the replacement for ES8249S under warranty. They actually sent me the latest one [[ASIN:B005DKKBP6 Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc5 Men?s Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Multi-Flex Pivoting Head and Automatic Cleaning System]]. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but kudos to Panasonic for standing behind their product and warranty policy. I&#x27;m still using Braun now because the shave is so smooth and close.</li>
    <li> This razor is extremely comfortable. I have shaved with 5 blade manual razors and rotary shavers, but I always end up with red bumps on my neck. I play violin, so I would get ingrown hairs and a burning pain that lasted all day, no matter how often or gently I shaved. With this Braun, my neck only gets a little red, and any irritation is gone within half an hour. My only problem with this is that I have trouble getting a close shave on my neck and along my jawline, because the hair grows in all different directions. Perhaps I just need to adjust my technique. Either way, the comfort is worth it in my book.</li>
    <li> Compared to the Braun 190s-1 which I have been using for the past 7 years, this shaver is quieter, more comfortable and smoother on the skin and provides a closer shave.  Unlike some other Braun shavers, this one does not have a swivel head, which is fine.  The instructions state that it should be charged for 4 hours the first time and subsequent charges take 1 hour (after it is completely discharged).  It has a plastic case that covers the shaving head and start button.</li>
    <li> The razor does what it is supposed to in a satisfactory fashion. Overall squarely mediocre in operation, it&#x27;ll give a nice shave eventually it just takes more patience and passes than the electric razor i had years ago, which to be fair, was a rotary style and more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like and intend to use this razor until the head needs replacing so it isn&#x27;t horrible. In my experience it works best in this order by application; wet shaver &amp;#60; dry shaver &amp;#60; just out of the shower and patted dry/warm dry towel. In the shower it ran downright poorly so if that is your intention i would look at other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reason for purchasing was equal parts a preference for electric and frugality. With a standard razor (mach3) i used to go through a blade every 4-5 days @ ~$2 a blade that is $150+ a year. So this razor will pay for itself in a couple months and the same could be done with a top of the line model with a few more months. Used daily or near daily it doesn&#x27;t take -much- longer to get a good result, but it does sap away a minute or two extra each morning. After a long weekend i would recommend a standard razor around if time is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt, pull hairs or anything like that, just misses a few every pass especially on my neck and corner of my jawbone. Looks and feels nice, battery seems good. Considering the price i basically flipped a coin between a 3-4 star rating, it really is a good value, just not great one for my face. Every face is different after all.</li>
    <li> Good but blades razor is better</li>
    <li> Like it a lot, ues it other day</li>
    <li> A great product.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the effectiveness of the shave I receive. I used a Remington for thirty years and was very disappointed in how quickly the heads got dull, Not in the earlier years, but they cheapened the quality and it got dull very much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lead to believe that Braun was of better quality, but so far I am disappointed in the speed at which it shaves. One has to keep going over the area to get a clean shave. I am not going to buy a $200.00 Braun to see if I get a better shave.  If they are as proud of their shaver as they say, they can sent me one and prove it to me. I also believe the replacement heads are very expensive. I am thinking about going to a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very satisfied with amazon&#x27;s delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 20 dollar electric shaver I bought at walmart. Unlike that one, it holds a charge very well, and it is a much closer shave. Not quite razor close, but pretty darn close, and much more convenient than regular razors. I have never used the wet functionality, but I like the option. Just a warning: do not skip a day, and if you ever skip two, best keep some good old fashioned cheap bic&#x27;s on hand. Maybe it&#x27;s impossible for an electric shaver to shave this close and have the ability to cut a couple day&#x27;s stubble. I don&#x27;t know. But since owning this one I have, out of necessity, become much more consistent in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great at first. I&#x27;ve owned two of them recently. Neither lasted longer than a year. I&#x27;ll not try a third time.</li>
    <li> My father and man a gift, and satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Very glad to be purchased at an affordable price&lt;br /&gt;I would like to propose with his friends.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave, easy, quick</li>
    <li> It works well.&lt;br /&gt;Valuable!</li>
    <li> This product is no better or worse than the electric screen razors from the late 70&#x27;s or early 80&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve always preferred the clean-shaven look.  I generally go for the blades in the shower with soap on the face.  This razor will do in a pinch if you follow it up with a blade if the hair gets long and you need to shorten it before you put the blade to it.  I&#x27;m Irish.  Don&#x27;t consider my facial hair very thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product as an adjunct to a blade.</li>
    <li> The price is quite good</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically to shave my head. I have always used a Gillette Mach 3 and the last time was the last straw. I was tired of cutting my had and thought I would give this a try. Holy Shi*! This thing is awesome. It shaves my head to a smooth soft finish and never cuts or nicks it. I have used it wet and dry and both ways work great. I will never and I mean ever go back to shaving my head with a bladed razor after using this Braun! Customer for life..</li>
    <li> Excellent device complies with my exectativas, recommend it to all who like quality ..</li>
    <li> Not used an electric razor since the 70&#x27;s and hated it. What an improvement !  Does a great job with ease and easy cleanup.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive quiet and effective day to day. Not good on a two day beard</li>
    <li> It looks nice and&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it yet so rating may be wrong&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;yes-as far as we know</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun electric shaver. After about 5 years, the old one had a battery that would not charge well, so I opted for a new one. I have used electric razors for years and find this one to be effective and convenient. The wet or dry feature allows me to choose to shave wet or dry...(and it does make a difference). Anyway, I think this is a quality razor and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can say that this shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned and that&#x27;s something coming from a guy who is 53yo. Mainly owned Panasonic before and they tend to go blunt quickly. This new Braun seemed to catch the stubble much better over all contours, getting close under the nose and clearing away longer hairs. Had a very good feel to it, let alone my smooth as a baby face. Results are as close as a disposable shaver blade. Single charge lasts longer than any other cordless shaver I have owned. The charger plug is small and the base unit is small. The cord is stretchy curled so you don&#x27;t end up with a long wire all over the place. 6 months ago I bought the single foil Braun Traveller battery shaver and was very impressed with it. It also shaved very close. However, after constant use over 6 moths, it is not shaving as close as it once did. I&#x27;m hoping this new 3Series will keep doing its excellent job for many more months.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun razor that I have owned. To me, the are the best. This Braun really holds a charge for a long time. It is very comfortable, easy to clean, and ergonomically designed to fit my hand and face. It does not come with any case if you travel. You could probably find a small camera type case if you need to travel with the Braun. This has a reasonable price compared to the other models of Braun.</li>
    <li> The skin burns a lot after the shave.</li>
    <li> The battery in my old Norelco stopped taking a charge after 9 years. It still worked plugged in, but it badly needed a new head, so rather than invest anything in it I decided to get a new shaver. This Braun had good reviews, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works fine on my checks and most parts of my neck, but I find it very difficult to shave up to and around my goatee without butchering it. Hold the shaver in one direction, it doesn&#x27;t get the whiskers right next to the goatee. Hold it in the other, and it grabs and pulls goatee hairs. It&#x27;s even harder to shave the little areas I need to inside the goatee. As a result, it takes me 3 times as long to shave cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks like they advise to see if I got used to it, but I&#x27;m giving up. I&#x27;m taking them up on their money back guarantee and buying another Norelco rotary blade shaver instead.</li>
    <li> This comfortable ergonomic wet / dry shaver does all you&#x27;d need done on your face, seated and close.  It gets around the soul patch almost without looking.  I had a smaller flat Braun 20 years ago and loved it so much over the years that I resoldered in a new battery after the first 5 years out of maybe 15 yrold before it died all the way.  Glad to see and hold this Braun, works like a champ, battery lasts almost a month.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND IS VERY PLEASED WITH HIS NEW BRAUN SHAVER.  HE ALWAYS PREFERRED BRAUN AND THIS ONE IS JUST AS GOOD AS EVER.  IT IS A QUALITY PRODUCT AND DOES THE BEST JOB.  IT ARRIVED IN A TIMELY FASHION AND HE IS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS SHAVER AND AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Takes significantly longer to shave than equivalent price Phillips Norelco. I&#x27;m tempted to return this but don&#x27;t really want to go through the pain. Might wait it out, and if I get really annoyed by unclean and long shave in a few month I&#x27;ll just go buy a Phillips Norelco or a Series 5 which I heard is significantly better than Series 3.</li>
    <li> best , quietest, smoothest electric shaver till this day. If it ever messes up, im buying the exact same on again. thanks again.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised.  I like the way this shaver works and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I have used it for about five weeks and so far it has been doing a very good job</li>
    <li> Worst electric razor I have ever owned!  I have been buying electronic razors for 30 years and this is terrible.</li>
    <li> This is my first foil shaver and it works great, much better than any of the rotary shavers I have owned.  I always had a hard time getting a good shave on my neck with the rotary but not with this Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> I previously sent a review of this product. I shaved at least 12 times with this shaver and had the same result. Did not cut regardless of theposition of the unit.complained to Braun and they sent me a new head at no charge Should have ordered a Norelco rotary instead.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, smooth face results in a fraction of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for up to a week</li>
    <li> I have facial hair that grows in many directions. I&#x27;ve owned many different types of shavers in the past, but I am returning to Braun again. They are the best.</li>
    <li> When I first used it to shave my beards, I push it hard to my face, it hurted me, my face got red all day. Then one of my fried said that the way you use it was wrong, you should move forward and backward in your face. That is the correct way to use Braun 3-340s to shave breads. I just love it very much.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3-340 provides a pretty good shave without razor burn.  I work a job that requires me to be clean shaven.  For years this requirement has produced razor burn during the week and scraggly growth on the weekends.  This razor ended the cycle.  The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, but it is close enough.  The Braun 340 takes about twice as long to get a good shave as with a razor and has a really hard time shaving my neck, but other than that, it&#x27;s fantastic.  I highly recommend this to anybody who has sensitive skin that is irritated by shaving.  At the same cost as a pack of the razor blades I use, giving it a try was a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Had lots of hair left regardless of how many passes we took.</li>
    <li> Pay attention to what some of the other people are saying, this razor does not give a close or even shave at all.  When you are done you look and there are patches of hair all over your face.  You have to go over and over and over until your neck and chin are raw.</li>
    <li> Really can&#x27;t beat this shaver in this price range. Performs as good as more expensive shavers.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old shaver, a similar model Braun, because after a few years the cutter had officially become not so sharp anymore.  I really am a Buy American kind of guy for most things, but nothing made in the USA has lasted like that Braun shaver.  This new one has been going strong for months.  I had a few Remingtons over the years and they would get dull quickly and some would destroy their foil cutter given only a little stress.  I&#x27;ve never seen a Braun eat its own foil cutter no matter how much travel abuse it receives.</li>
    <li> This shaver met and exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Does everything advertised for a great price. I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a good deal and a great cut.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric shaver after reading all the positive reviews on Amazon.  I stopped using electric shavers 15 years ago because I have a very tough beard and none of them worked great.  Apparently, after 15 years they still don&#x27;t give me a close shave and I have to go over my face way too many times just to look decent.  If you have normal or light stubble this will work good.  If you are like me and have strong scruff, I would only buy this for vacation travel or toss it in your car for an emergency situation.</li>
    <li> good product, very reliable.</li>
    <li> Shaves close and charges fast.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric shaver...works perfect. Great battery. I have sensitive skin and only very minor irratation....once....and that&#x27;s because i am obsessive and re shave areas.....o can&#x27;t stand even one straggler hair...hmm.....i take this on weekend trips..battery lasts . no issues....&lt;br /&gt;I have used both wet and dry...i think dry odds best for me.....super value asks price....arrived in two days!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a good shaver, but not that good. It is so good that it feels like you shaved using a razor blade.</li>
    <li> Efficiency is very high</li>
    <li> Best, most comfortable electric shaver I&#x27;ve used to date. If this ever kicks the bucket, I&#x27;m getting another. Just get it.</li>
    <li> Had an older model for many years; it finally &#x27;bit the dust&#x27; [the battery did not charge well anymore].&lt;br /&gt;The new model looks &#x27;flashier&#x27; and it does its job reasonably well, but not as good as the old model&lt;br /&gt;in my opinion. Still, it works well and gets the job done. Tried it in the shower and it works fine there.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it over many other brands.</li>
    <li> this is the best electric shver Iv&#x27;e ever owned in over 60 years of sporadic use.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves quickly and as close as a blade. I see no reason to pay for a more expensive shaver (which I have owned before)I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Other than the fact that it is NOT made in the U.S.A,it is a good buy and works well ,charges fast</li>
    <li> I spent months deciding if I should buy this.  I have an old braun.  ok it feels better on the face.  It is smoother.  It shaves as well as the old one.  It doesn&#x27;t shave any better.  It is a nice shave but I have a heavy beard and I can still see a 5 oclock shadow when done.  I admit even a sharp blade can&#x27;t clean shave me well and anyone who says this shaver leaves a smooth skin shave is wrong.  I use it daily but I have yet to find any shaver that leaves smooth skin on a heavy beard.  Still I am glad I own it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated close-shavers because of the knicks and bumps they result in. This one warns that you need about a week to get used to it and sure enough that was basically it. Plus it cuts close enough to clean the face, but not so close that in-growing hairs result! The sideburns trimmer works really well too for either a not-so-close shave or to get any hairs that the shaver misses (about 1%). Being a wet-dry is also great - helps with a quick cleanup (and I don&#x27;t engulf it in water, so no worries about short-circuits or rusting - so far anyway).</li>
    <li> To help her husband bought one, and my dad bought a direct mail, very convenient.</li>
    <li> Shaves take forever. I have to go over the same areas over and over and over. Eventually my face is smooth, but who has that kind of time? Back to razors.</li>
    <li> Loud, and ergonomically not as comfortable as expected.  I do get a very close shave, but it takes twice as long as my old N... did.  Not displeased but it could be better.  Perhaps newer more expensive models are better.</li>
    <li> first electric shaver i ever had that actually worked. worth every bit of the money. $19 remingtons?? that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re worth!</li>
    <li> Great razor!  I (mom) am able to easily shave my special needs adult son without him being fearful of getting cut.  Very easy to use (for someone who never had to use an electric razor before!) and clean.</li>
    <li> Decent nothing to rave about.</li>
    <li> The review was delayed.&lt;br /&gt;Now I could see a lot of busy products.&lt;br /&gt;Quite a good product ...&lt;br /&gt;The sufficient value.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver, easy to clean, light weight and very quiet.  This is the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Really amazing razor. Definitely the best one I&#x27;ve ever bought.  It was my first non rotary razor and its given me such a close quick shave. Handled a one week beard like it was nothing</li>
    <li> My father-in-law loves this.  He says it&#x27;s hard to find an electric razor that doesn&#x27;t have three round razor controls.</li>
    <li> Waste of product does not shave close or good garbage unfortunately im sorry to be so blunt</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Very strong battery easy to clean and a great shave.  My 13 year old Braun, though still working good,  is resting and awaiting an emergency call, which if the new is like the old one, I would have to blow off the dust if it was needed for duty.  The older Brauns, manufactured in Germany, were, in my  opinion, the best razors made.  We can only hope the new ones last as long.</li>
    <li> Garbage. Takes three times as long as a regular razor. I keep going over the same area and the hair is still there. Electric razors are a worthless gimmick I want my 70 dollars back.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun and the best one I&#x27;ve had. Braun is the best!</li>
    <li> This elected shaver is great. I have had bad experiences with products like this in the past that were at this price point. This one is different. It has a foil shaver which is great for stubble, and also another razor on the back that works better on longer hair. I bought this because my face is easily irritated when using a regular bladed razor and I usually get too lazy to shave every day. After receiving this, I can shave every day as it doesn&#x27;t take long. You don&#x27;t need shaving cream or anything. It also is a really close shave for a foil shaver and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like regular bladed razors. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Although this takes twice as long as a regular Gillette shave it does shave close only trouble I had was in the neck area will it perform poorly, and if your like me wet shaved don&#x27;t cut so I dry shave, and I found out how to get a even closer shave, and more comfortable shave go out, and buy your self a electric pre shave I use lectric preshave, and this little product made it allot easier to shave my neck, and remove neck stubble. nice little product sometimes I even shave in the car on my way to school due to the convince of it.  The reason I give it 3 stars is because it just seems impossible to get a decent wet shave using this machine, the shaver seems to just glide over very annoying, so I just avoid wet shaved altogether with this product</li>
    <li> one excellen buying experience. good product, not use now. good package. very fast international delivery time, to china. very good.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery, courier rapidly. After receipt of stuff very satisfied, feel thick, powerful, has a gift, a good business!</li>
    <li> Good razor cathes hair under chin better than norelco</li>
    <li> It sails along the skin with the greatness of ease!</li>
    <li> i was little confused about how close shave this will give me but after buying this electric shaver first time for my face i was really happy and it was more than what i was expected , gives me really close shave almost like Gillette shaving blades plus best thing about this electric shaver is zero cut . im glad that i bought this shaver .</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver, can be used wet or dry, I would definitely recommend. I use with shave gel and it works like a charm</li>
    <li> This is a gift for a friend. He said Good to have, easy use, very good product accrording my friend&#x27; comments</li>
    <li> Not satisfied with logistics.The razor was clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my adult son who has sensitive skin and it has been a godsend.  It shaves much closer than any other electric he&#x27;s tried so there&#x27;s no need to keep going over the same area again and again.  Great quality, as usual, from Braun.  I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s ever had this close of shave in his life.</li>
    <li> works perfect io like it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use even once.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Works good but I go over the same spot a few times in order to get all the straggler hairs. Over all good price and good buy!</li>
    <li> very reliable and well built, no battery fade over time, completely waterproof, very close shave. best shaver under $50 without a doubt. if i could say anything about this shaver is it takes a few passes to get all the hair, and im not sure if its powerful enough for the thickest beards.</li>
    <li> Takes way too long to remove stubble from face  and never gets it all off.</li>
    <li> This shaver has been okay.  I’ve used it both wet and dry, and I think it works better wet, but it’s also harder to clean that way.  It does hold a charge well - the last time I charged it was three weeks ago (using it almost every day) and I don’t need to charge it yet.</li>
    <li> this my second Braun, the first lasted about a decade but no longer held much of a charge. this seems well built, can be cleaned with water (which I have not tried), works reasonably well on a longer 2 day beard, trimmer works well, I like the flashing warning light when the charge is getting low and the shaving head is kind of &amp;#34;spring loaded&amp;#34; and floats with the contours of your face which is nice. I got about 2 weeks or more of shaves out of the initial charge so the battery life is great.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver works great! I have thick unruly facial hair &amp; this really gets the job done. It doesn&#x27;t cut or scratch your face the way cheaper electric shavers do and leave cut/scratch marks on your face after you shave. I shave with it every other day &amp; so far so good.</li>
    <li> an electric shaver that simply delivers powerful results in such a short time. an art all by itself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift. Seems great!</li>
    <li> Not used，But it looks good.</li>
    <li> Best shaver...beats all ladies&#x27; shavers I&#x27;ve tried.  And I&#x27;ve tried several.</li>
    <li> Not sure why it was so popular, perhaps the price.  I found the shaver to be lacking and after four uses I have already purchased the shaver I should have bought instead of this one.</li>
    <li> My husband says that it is much much better for skin and faster than shaving with blades and foam. But he has to finish shaving  with blade because this shaver doesn&#x27;t work conveniently on the neck</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a close shave. I prefer the ones that work both ways. With and without the cord. The trimmer for long hair must be held at a certain angle to cut certain areas. The older models worked at more angles. The protective cap is loose and easily come off and possibly cause damage. Guess I was spoiled on the older models.</li>
    <li> Not as great as advertised.  Probably better than the Norelco shaver, but still a chore to use and tough to get a decent shave comparable to traditional methods.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used. I have used wet electric shavers with shaving gel for the last 7 years. I went through three Panasonics and one Norelco. I never was completely happy with the results and lack of close shave compared to a blade. However, I no longer can use a blade due to sensitive skin. This Braun provides me a comfortable and very close &amp;#34;smooth skin&amp;#34; shave.</li>
    <li> This works really well, I have thick facial hair and it does a good job over the other electric razors I have owned.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with the first one but the replacement works fine.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver ever!</li>
    <li> it is ok, not that clean.</li>
    <li> This razor works fine.  My only disappointment is that it does not work while plugged in.  I assume this is a &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; feature, since this razor is designed for wet and dry operation, to keep Braun from getting sued by someone who tries to plug it in and use it in the tub or shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous razor was a Braun Series 3 that looks almost identical, except it is gray in color instead of blue.  That one worked either on battery or while plugged in, but was not advertised as waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small complaint, I know, since the battery will get me through a week or so before I need to recharge it.  I would just prefer to have the option of using it while plugged in- don&#x27;t want to get caught with a dead battery when it approaches the end of its useful life, and not be able to shave until it has sat on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, however, the waterproof feature is nice for cleaning.  I can empty the compartment of whiskers after a shave and run it under the faucet for a few seconds, and it is as clean as when I took it out of the box.  For me, this is much less hassle and more efficient than the models that come with a stand for charging and cleaning.  Those cost 2-3 times as much, and you still have to deal with frequently changing the cleaning solution- which evaporates quickly and is also expensive.  I even tried mixing my own (rubbing alcohol with a bit of aftershave), which works well and is less expensive, but is still more of a hassle than it&#x27;s worth to me.  It is far simpler to just run this razor under the faucet briefly after a shave.</li>
    <li> When it&#x27;s not tugging on hairs, it&#x27;s missing them entirely. This shaver can&#x27;t decide if it wants to cut so short you get razor burn or leave you looking like someone with a last name of &amp;#34;Scruffins&amp;#34;. I have no idea why the reviews are so high for this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried wet shaves with and without shaving cream; multiple types of shaving cream; and even dry shaves. The worst shaver/razor I have ever used. If I could leave 0 stars, I would. I gave it the full six weeks they recommend and my skin hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;adapted&amp;#34; and I can no longer return it, convenient of them to recommend such a long introductory period.</li>
    <li> good condition and satisfactory!!!</li>
    <li> Do not short beard well-mowers</li>
    <li> Shaving results were pretty good, but how many there will be some tingling skin.</li>
    <li> Powerfull, sharp shave, the head is a little big but i got use to it.  Nice buy</li>
    <li> Husband hasn&#x27;t used it wet, but holds a charge for a long time and he says doesn&#x27;t pull on his facial hair so he&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> really love the long hair trimmer design.</li>
    <li> My Remington foil shave is now dead, which I did like it lasted a few years till I dropped it again and messed up razor holding component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: May 14, 2016: Still functioning just fine, I would hope so for most stuff today since quality these days have dropped in standards.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my friend,it is great.</li>
    <li> Not as good a shave as I was expecting. Have to go over same area several times to get clean shave, a two day groth seams to be a problem with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Dependable not not that close of a shave.  Medium quality.</li>
    <li> What a dissapointment.  I have a Panasonic ES8103S and didn&#x27;t want to pay for the pricey replacement cartridges and saw this on sale for $40 so I gave it a shot.  It&#x27;s Braun, can&#x27;t go wrong right?  WRONG!  The cheap plastic pieces that hold the vibrating springs together fell off within the first week.  Not just one of the 3, 2 of the 3!  I didn&#x27;t realize until the next morning when my shave was terrible.  I&#x27;d post a picture if it wasn&#x27;t in the trash.  Back to the trusty Panasonic it its!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was working (for less than a week), it did the job pretty well.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t continue to work.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun shaver.  All of them have shaved well.  This is the best so far, I use it on my head as well as my face and it give a good close shave in both areas.  It is easy to clean, either by running water, or by the brush that is included.  Replacing the head only once every 18 months is a big plus in my book.</li>
    <li> good quality with made in china. Come very quick. Unfortu there is no shaver bag included. Good stuff. worth that money.</li>
    <li> very good i like it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i love it&lt;br /&gt;good&lt;br /&gt;goood&lt;br /&gt;goood&lt;br /&gt;goooood&lt;br /&gt;goooood&lt;br /&gt;good im da hehe heh heh e</li>
    <li> This ones right in the middle of the 3 series. Can be used for dry shaving or with cream(shaving cream, not butter) unlike the lower 3 series. I dont know whats the difference between all the 3 series, but i went with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts close the first pass. My old braun 5 series(~8years old) crapped out, used to take 4 passes to cut as close as this new 340s does.</li>
    <li> This is my second one and I really like it. Does a good job charges fast and is durable. The foil stays good for months.</li>
    <li> I like Braun shavers and I have had many of them. I was very excited that this one was both a wet and dry shaver however it turned out to be a waste of money. The Shaver stopped turning on (even though it said is was fully charged) after 4 months. Honestly just keep your money and find a different product.</li>
    <li> VERY CLEAN AROUND MOUTH, BUT FOR THE NECK, IT&#x27;S USELESS</li>
    <li> It is OK but nothing to brag about.  Will not purchase another.</li>
    <li> Good shaver.....it doesn&#x27;t get every hair the first try. I like the you can rinse it out. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> It is nice but there are better out there... but for something quick it is worth it!</li>
    <li> only had this for a couple of shaves now. closer shave than any razor i&#x27;ve ever used minus the irritation. awaiting the durability of this product and ease of servicing</li>
    <li> The cutter knife is mading China, but not the original from German.</li>
    <li> I have always liked &#x27;BRAUN&#x27; shavers, but find just about any/all electric shavers to be marginally (compared to manual razors) -- ineffective!</li>
    <li> Great and still working at its best!</li>
    <li> I have had decades of good shaves with Braun electric razors, so when my ten year-old Braun died (switch failed) I wanted another Braun. That model was no longer made, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds on a new razor.  This has turned out to be a very comfortable, close-shaving razor and I&#x27;m pleased with it so far.</li>
    <li> No need fansy shaver. This product is just simple and effective. If you don&#x27;t have alot of facial hair like me this is more than enough.</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun shaver user for over 20 years.  The one I bought in 2005 was still going strong but my charger cable got damaged and I could not find a replacement.  I decided on impulse to just order a new shaver.  I had been curious about wet/dry shavers and I saw that this one was around $50.  I took a chance on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does a surprisingly good job.  I use it in the shower just after washing my face.  It works just about as well as any electric shaver I have used.  I still use a blade razor to shave my neck.  I use the Braun to get the cheeks and chin area that are very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design of the shaver a lot.  It fits great in your hand and has a great grip to it.  I like the charger cord that coils like a phone receiver cord.  It is so much easier to handle than a long straight cord.</li>
    <li> i use it in the shower everyday don&#x27;t worry it really is water proof</li>
    <li> This redesigned Chinese-made Braun gives me the best shave I have had in several years. It&#x27;s my THIRD Braun shaver, all in the 300-series. Avoid the gimmicky wet/dry system shavers. They are a waste of money and the refills will bankrupt you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model is a barebones middle-of-the-pack offering but it does a GREAT job and it&#x27;s priced very right. Although it&#x27;s all plastic drive mechanism may not last as long as the previous Braun designs, who wants a 5-year-old plus shaver anyway? For those who claim they cannot get a close enough shave with this model, I ask &amp;#34;What kind of Brillo pads do you have stuck to your face?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver head floats and has a nice springy feel as it glides over your face and provides a smooth and close shave. It takes a few passes but the results are outstanding. The sideburn/mustache trimmer is also extremely effective. It provides for a nice, clean cut line - a big improvement over older models. I like the feel of the ergonomics and shave angle that the grip provides along with the lightweight travel recharger that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part that sucks is the cheap, sloppily fitting, doesn&#x27;t-stay-attached protective plastic cover. Geez, Braun, include a cheap carrying case already! Otherwise, a winner on all counts! Get one!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my hubby for fathers day and he was not satisfied. He said a regular shaver shaves better than this one. Maybe electric shavers are not for him!</li>
    <li> This works so well! It holds its charge for a long time and it works so well in the shower. I get a better shave with this than a razor. I don&#x27;t have razor burn either. I have been using it equally in the shower (wet) and out of the shower (dry). It performs so well! Very impressed. If you want an extreemly comfortable shave that is super close, use it in the shower with shaving cream. Buy a shower mirror too!</li>
    <li> Absolutely PERFECT!  As advertised and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I used shaver once or twise in a week an charged 2-3 times in a month. after 30 (aprox) charge charger stopped working...</li>
    <li> My fiance loves his shaver. He stated the only problem is the shave is not as close as he would like it to be. But, overall a great shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> I always used Remmington. this one is better.  It shaved closer and easier to keep clean. a good buy for the price</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Much nicer than my previous Bruan with self cleaning system.</li>
    <li> My husband has a very thick beard and this product works great. He also has sensitive skin. It has held up well.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially my neck and upper lip, simply cannot take a blade to either area. I could not be happier with this electric shaver, I shave my face, problem areas included daily without issue. Leaves a clean close shave. Battery life is insane.</li>
    <li> I live in Europe so the electrical plug is for the UK not for the EUR!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Haven´t tried yet under the shower.</li>
    <li> Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband.  He really likes it. Said it shaves very close without going over same spot multiple times. He loves that it&#x27;s wet/ dry</li>
    <li> It gives a close comfortable shave. (No it is not razor close but it is fine form daily use).  It is easy to clean and the trimmer works well. Charger is reasonably small and compact.  I have had it for about a month and am very satisified with it.</li>
    <li> I have a very tinder neck and this is the first elect. razor that did not burn my neck!&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Good deal, holds the charge, light weight, very ;manageable. Fits the hand well.  Would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I was happy using my OLD Braun shaver (not cordless of course!) for many years, and I still use its trim feature occasionally.  In the meantime though, I switched to a Remington cordless for daily use.  I didn&#x27;t like it nearly as much, but reluctantly continued using the new Remington because I was determined not to &amp;#34;wear out&amp;#34; my old Braun shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately - or should I say fortunately(!) -- the Remington wore out after a few years and so, based on my satisfaction with the old Braun shaver, I was motivated to search for a new Braun shaver ...and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package and saw that it was &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; though (not in Germany or the USA say), I started to worry that the quality of Braun shavers may have been compromised over the years.  But my initial fears were groundless because it has been working perfectly.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, gentle on the skin, and gives a nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t vouch for the &amp;#34;Wet Shaver&amp;#34; feature as I have no intention of using that anyway.  But I can certainly vouch for its use as a &amp;#34;Dry Shaver&amp;#34; -- it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> great price for good quality. its the most basic shaver but for a regular shaving it is more than enough. advise to buy to everyone.</li>
    <li> i used it and like it very much</li>
    <li> not as loud as i thought it would be. clean and close shave. feels good in the hand. still getting the hang of the whole &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34; but the dry shave comes as close to my safety razor as can be</li>
    <li> The two tiny foils just do not get the job done. I have to go over the same area countless times before I finally get a reasonably clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;One larger foil would have been so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the sideburn trimmer.</li>
    <li> Have only used this item dry &amp; have had no problem.  Close shaves with no irritation and is a great value.  Would recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> The best razor I&#x27;ve had by far. I previously used one of the 3D Sensor Phillips that cost be over $200 for a year and a Norelco that cost me over $150 for a couple years. This I got for under $60 and it&#x27;s extremely better than either of those. I use to get razor burn with all other razors I used, which I thought it was pretty much unavoidable for me. I got this razor and my razor burn marks are disappearing and I no longer get razor burn. I would recommend putting on blade lubricate before every shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright.  I don&#x27;t like it as well as my old Braun 7526 shaver.  You have to really press down on your face with this shaver to get a close shave.  My 7526 shaves close by just gliding across your face.</li>
    <li> My husband has been a Braun user for thirty years, but this model is terrible...lost him as a brand consumer!</li>
    <li> sideburn trimmer could be improved</li>
    <li> MY father love it so much</li>
    <li> I hope there are more goods can ship to China directly.</li>
    <li> i love it, high quality, low price.</li>
    <li> Very good, I like, thank you</li>
    <li> unsteady in stand - plug for charger too wide for easy use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers last 20 years. I think they know what customers want. I can recommand this product to you.</li>
    <li> Husband likes this.  Its good quality.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend love it!</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great buy.  The short hair trimmer works great for neck area, while the shaver gets a smooth close shave.  Don&#x27;t need to say much more.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver.  Does a great.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband.  He&#x27;s been very happy with it. Works well.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a 3-year old Norelco that they no longer make new heads for. I purchased this shaver due to the high customer ratings. Sadly, my experience has not been very good with it. It doesn&#x27;t cut any of the small whiskers on my chin or jaw. I always have to use a manual razor to get all the spots that this shaver missed. Sometimes I even use my old shaver, with a head that is over 1 year old, to get the stragglers.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Does a good job.</li>
    <li> Hubby doesn&#x27;t like it at all....doesn&#x27;t do the job...</li>
    <li> It is ok but you have to pass many times on the same area to get the wanted results and I think that is a big hassle</li>
    <li> Doesnt really shave that good, I will not recommend this product to anyone, for the money I paid it should be a better product.</li>
    <li> My son got this, so I&#x27;m not sure how good it is - I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints, so it must be fine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver for my brother.  He is very particular.  He ended up returning the shaver but&lt;br /&gt;I do not believe his opinion would be fair judgement of the product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this electric shaver for a while now. Works very well, probably needs to be replaced every 3-4 years (though that&#x27;s without never changing the head, perhaps can stretch it for longer). For the price in particular it&#x27;s very tough to beat.</li>
    <li> In my case, the shave was not good. I had a Panasonic for years and after it finally broke, I thought I would try a Braun. For me, at least, this one did not work out well. In addition, the head of the razor kept popping off. It was very frustrating. Even if I tried to hold the top on with my finger, it would still pop off and the blades would be left to just rattle around inside it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I don&#x27;t have a lot of luck with razors or shavers. And I see it received other positive reviews. If you don&#x27;t suffer many problems with these products as I have done, then certainly, your experience may be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, unlike most shavers, this one didn&#x27;t chew up my neck and leave marks. It just didn&#x27;t shave it very well either.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best electric shavers I have ever used I use mine mainly for shaving my head and I received the closest shave ever about equal to using a regular razor blade type shaver thank you Braun for a great product</li>
    <li> I switched from a Norelco to Braun.  I am very happy I did.  This shaver holds it charge for more than a week and I get a very close shave.  I also like the charger base which keeps it upright on your counter.  It also looks cool.  I will definitely by another one.</li>
    <li> This shaver was a big dissapointment for me.  I had to take it back after one use . It would simply not remove the hairs on my face!  Took multiple pass throughs each time with all the different types of movements  I could think of.</li>
    <li> The razor is not good...voice is very loud,and it doesn&#x27;t works well &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;</li>
    <li> this razor is awesome</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver as the gift for my father of Father&#x27;s Day.Dad speaks highly of it, it looks cool and it&#x27;s convenient , easy to use the Braun shaver .A satisfied online shopping.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut!  I bought it for my husband as he has always wanted an electric shaver, but this was a total disappointment! He never mentioned anything after using it a few times, but I noticed he quit using it.  I tried it on my leg to see how well it worked.  I went over and over and over and over one spot with zero results!  We live in HI and return shipping is ridiculous so basically we are just out that money. I really wanted my husband to love it :(</li>
    <li> Perfect electric shaver</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver for the money!  Full charge lasts several shaves. Very happy with the shaving performance too. Get shaver for the money!</li>
    <li> This purchase was made to replace my son&#x27;s 9 year old electric razor(also a Braun), it was less than half the price of his old one, and it is just as nice...he loves it! He was concerned that it didn&#x27;t have the long hair trimmer, like his old one, because they don&#x27;t specify that in the features at the top of the product page...but it does have this feature. They should list this more prominently in the product description on the page...I almost didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason, but I went to Braun&#x27;s site and looked up the model # to find the complete list of features. It also arrived in 2 days, which was quick considering I don&#x27;t have a Prime membership!</li>
    <li> I use this razor daily to get a close shave.  The trimmer edge is also very nice to trim my sideburns.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t like electric shavers as they never give me a clean shave, but this shaver is great.  I would recommend it</li>
    <li> It does the work but looks bulky and material looks cheap. I had a Panasonic used for six years feels better than this and still works great. Only find out that the battery cannot last as long as before and seems its time to need a new one.</li>
    <li> The best shaver I have ever owned. Close thing to a real razor blade shave.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 3-340s Wet</li>
    <li> great razor my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Good shave, trimmer worked well and the battery lasted over a week on a single charge.</li>
    <li> Cheap and good.Works nice.</li>
    <li> Does not work well at all on a beard that is more than 2 days old. Have to switch to a regular razor and doesn&#x27;t do that well on a day old beard either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charger stopped working. Won&#x27;t charge the shaver now so I can&#x27;t even use it. It will be less expensive and less trouble now to buy something else and it will be a different brand.</li>
    <li> Good !&lt;br /&gt; Shower and clean cutting and to be able to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I should get for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day. so, selected it!! I will present.</li>
    <li> My second Braun.  The other was almost 20 years old.  This shaves smooth, easy and comfortably.</li>
    <li> Does not do a close shave.</li>
    <li> Not as close shaving as I would like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little hard on razors since I generally dislike shaving, and really only shave when the beard is getting itchy or if I want to clean up. That said, I&#x27;m willing to spend the time it takes. The problem I have is that the 30 year old Norelco that I have never had serviced is better at removing 4-5 days growth than this Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of are as efficient as using actual hair clippers and a finishing with a normal, manual Gillette wet razor. All that I was hoping for was a quick, even reduction. It&#x27;s not quick, and it&#x27;s not even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does eventually get the job done, but sadly, it&#x27;s actually slower than the hair clippers and Gillette method, even with waiting for the water to soften my beard for the wet shave.</li>
    <li> Good Shaver. Good trimmer. Kind of noisy but not obnoxious. Close shave but I&#x27;m used to electrics.</li>
    <li> Does what I want. Fairly quiet and holds a charge a decent amount of time. Still too new to rate durability.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts close enough for smoothness but doesn&#x27;t give me razor bumps or pimples like a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;Easy cleaning. I just rinse with water and wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;Easy recharge.&lt;br /&gt;Takes me less than 2 minutes to shave my face now and I don&#x27;t need shaving cream or feel the need to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t shave in the shower I can easily see any spots I missed.&lt;br /&gt;After shaving I just rinse my face instead of cleaning up shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy and convenient I don&#x27;t mind shaving every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;What are cons? :3</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a pretty good clean shave. No skin irritation. If you get it do not get the blades that Amazon recommends along with the shaver, they are the wrong blades. This shaver requires the 32S/32B foil cassette not the 30b ones amazon is suggesting.&lt;br /&gt;I did not realize this until I purchased them and they arrived, from S. Korea! So now I have to send them back.</li>
    <li> This Braun 340S-4 is so much better than my previous Braun shaver.  The old on still works over 10 years.</li>
    <li> Best unit of all their shavers. I&#x27;ve used their other high end models and this lower priced one out performs them.</li>
    <li> I get a smooth shave with this. The price was excellent. Am tempted to buy another even though I don&#x27;t really need another one now.</li>
    <li> Some things never change! Perelli makes the best tires, Sony makes the best TVs, Leica makes the best cameras.  And Braun makes the best shavers, offering the best construction and design, sharpest blades, the strongest motors, the greatest longevity, and the closest shave in the business!&lt;br /&gt;Specifics, you want? Okay!&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you notice upon opening the &#x27;tamper proof&#x27; packaging is the robust construction and materials used for this shaver. It feels &#x27;solid&#x27;, like it could easily survive several drops to a tile bathroom fall without so much as a scratch.  If you&#x27;re REALLY observant, you&#x27;ll see why. While constructed largely of plastic and other synthetics, they&#x27;re the same industrial grade materials used in your Nikon and Canon DSLR bodies and lens housings. Even the molded handle is the same tough, &#x27;grippy&#x27; rubberlike compound as the handgrips of your Nikon D7100, and exhibited similarly excellent ergonomics. While I haven&#x27;t subjected the shaver to any MIL-STD-810J shock tests...nor do I plan to...these are TOUGH materials, designed to last! My &#x27;old&#x27; Braun shaver &#x27;resigned&#x27; after 15 years of loyal, unwavering service. How&#x27;s that for &#x27;product longevity&#x27;!  The entire shaver housing, including the encapsulated power switch, side trimmer, and motor to cutter head coupling  are fully sealed and waterproof. This shaver is intended for both wet and dry shaving. I&#x27;ve tried it in both dry and in the shower (using only Ivory handsoap for &#x27;shaving creme&#x27;) and performance is exemplary however you prefer to shave; \\&quot;baby&#x27;s butt smooth\\&quot;...every time! All the more impressive given that my Nixon-esque beard is more like high-carbon steel wire, case hardened to Rockwell C-70, than actual human hair.  The powerful motor in this instrument cut through my facial flora more like a laser than a razor. By contrast, Panasonic and Remington best just &#x27;couldn&#x27;t cut it&#x27;, their motors sounding anemic; as if they might \\&quot;stall under load\\&quot; at any moment, and worse, after 15 minutesuse, they still left me in need of a shave! The Braun, as I said, left my face perfectly clean and smooth, without ANY burning or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I am delighted to confer upon the Braun Series 3, 340S-4 shaver my very highest recommendation. In my opinion, and the opinions of MANY other lifelong customers, Braun shavers have always been the very best you can buy, and it looks like they always shall be!</li>
    <li> My previous shaver is also a Braun from the 5 series. I have been using it for over ten years. The reason for getting a new one was the inside battery (not replaceable) needs now recharging after two-three shaves. The Braun 3 Series works very well. Between recharges it takes about 15 days. Of cause with the time , as any battery, the charging will be more often. The cut is perfect for an electric shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was disappointed with the lack of  a travel case. I didn&#x27;t pay attention when I ordered it, considering that as  a given. All my previous shavers, Philips, Remington, Norelco and Braun came with a travel case, some sophisticated, some simple but it was part of the package. Cutting corners to increase a little bit of the profit gives a black eye for the Braun brand..</li>
    <li> its good but not as good as i hoped for, still i like it alike.</li>
    <li> Works great. Price is more than fair. No more skin irritations.</li>
    <li> Had used a rotary razor in the past. This is only the second foil type head razor I have owned, and it is by far the best, closest shaving razor I have used. I highly recommend this product for those of you considering making a switch to a electric razor.</li>
    <li> 1st electric razor and does just OK.  Find it takes longer to shave than with a razor if you want as smooth as a shave (or as close as possible) to a razor.  No irritation, easy to maintain and operate.  Just wish it shaved closer.  I do not have a heavy beard, so was hoping for a closer, cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> Battery Died after only 1 year and little use.</li>
    <li> This shaver is not quite to top of the line from Braun but it really is nice. I have tried it in the shower and it does a great job on my beard. It is easy to clean and it keeps a charge for a week at a time. l ordered the extra foil so that I can keep shaving without missing a beat. Nice buy.</li>
    <li> YOU IT DAILY.  SOMETIMES IN THE SHOWER AND OTHER TIMES DRY.  I THINK IT IS A LITTLE HEAVEY .  STILL OUTSTANDING.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor daily for the past few weeks .... and so far, all is going very well.</li>
    <li> it works well I like it so far my beard is tough and it takes it down to a smooth finish</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for my husband, as it was the least expensive in the Best Electric Shaver Reviews I read. I figured that if he didn&#x27;t like it, I would use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first time he used this shaver, he raved about how well it worked! He dumped his 3 other electric shavers, and said that he will never own anything but this device. Even though it was the least expensive listed in the BEST reviews.....it works!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the performance of this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you have very coarse facial hair it has trouble with mine, gets it down to a point where it is easier to use regular blade razor to finish the job.</li>
    <li> Reliable with long lasting charge and shaves as close as I need plus cleans easily plus the trimmer is something that I really have come to appreciate. I take it on all my business travels!&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was for my father-in-law but I have owned mine for almost 4 years.</li>
    <li> It worked well for about 4 months, then refused to turn on. I can&#x27;t find the paperwork that came with it, so it looks like I&#x27;m out the purchase price. I won&#x27;t be buying another Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s well built, priced well, looks great and is easy to clean and charge.... but i just don&#x27;t like the shave it gives me... maybe im too used to razors but i still have stubble after using this thing...im keeping it to use at work and it serves its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t expect a close shave... maybe all electric shavers are like this but it just doesnt sit well with me that my face still feels kinda rough after shaving... also sharp contours around the jaw line are really hard to get to with this razor, requires pulling the skin over your jaw line to a flat surface to shave the hairs.</li>
    <li> Works great around the mustache. I&#x27;ve used the sideburn shaver a lot, that works well. Seems well designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s absolutely horrible at shaving my neck. I have to go back with a manual razor for that.</li>
    <li> very good product for the price.  feels very solid.  shave very clean and quiet.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, the price is satisfactory, and meets all the quality is good.</li>
    <li> Awesome Razor.  Still, I have yet to use an electric razor that shaves as good as a regular (Shick/Gillette) razor with shaving cream (or in the shower.)</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price. If you want something simple this is for you but if you want something really fancy go for the series 5 or 7</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have thicker facial hair than most. But I have tried wet and dry and it didn&#x27;t give me a close shave at all. Went back to disposable blades.</li>
    <li> absolutely the worst electric shaver that I have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> This product does not work very well in thick hair or hair longer than 1/8 of an inch at least in my case.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I updated from version ! to Version 3.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice rolling head shaver that can be used wet or dry.  My husband uses it dry and is quite happy with the close shave he gets.  A charge lasts a long time also.  Easy to use and easy to clean.  A tad expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> it is ok, not close in neck area, last Braun I had was much better</li>
    <li> Fined my Panasonic gives a better shave, but always liked Braun.</li>
    <li> This shaver is really good when new. Shave close and the battery last for 4-5 light shaves before recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any electric shaver, I need to wait how long the blades will last and how much it will cost. How long the battery will last etc</li>
    <li> Fantastic . Love the shave.</li>
    <li> Did not see any ratings in CR for most of the shavers on the market.  Have owned well reviewed Panasonics for my last two razors.  They have been fine, but I didn&#x27;t really like the \\&quot;vertical\\&quot; orientation of the trimmer,  In addition, although I have gotten a fairly close shave it takes several passes. and the replacement screen/blade combo is fairly pricey.  I purchased this razor for about $20 more than the screen/blade combo for the Panasonic and overall prefer it to my more deluxe Panasonic.    The Good  - It provides as a close shave with less passes in comparison to my Panasonic  - I like the trimmer better  - I like the stand  - It appears to be marginally quieter than the Panasonic (possibly because it is operating at lower speed)  - Replacement parts are slightly less expensive  - Still can shave wet if you desire and easy to clean with water  (although it \\&quot;shakes\\&quot; out better than my Panasonic so I don&#x27;t need to clean it as frequently)    The only feature you give up (that I value) is the much more precise indication of amount of charge remaining (however you can easily finish your shave when the light comes on and it recharges in about an hour)</li>
    <li> The fianc&amp;eacute; loves this</li>
    <li> super good.&lt;br /&gt;the only difference between 340 and 380 is whether there is a travel pouch or not.</li>
    <li> my father in law like it very much</li>
    <li> This electric wet and dry shaver works great on my face. I have to shave every single day if I want a hairless face. I really like how smooth my face ends up and I don&#x27;t have any outbreaks on my neck like I did with the other shaver.&lt;br /&gt;However- The removal of the head is not easy. I have to squeeze the ends in order to remove to clean.</li>
    <li> excellent product, especially since i had 2 different brand and way more expensive ones in the past and by far this is the best shaver. Also amazon does great as always</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-50s, and I&#x27;ve been shaving for a good forty years. I&#x27;ve shaved with the single blade &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razor, the Sears brand of Norelco, the real Norelco, Remington, twin blades, triple blades--you name the blade and brand, I&#x27;ve probably tried it. Include in that list a variety of shave creams, soaps powders, and methods. Each one left my face bleeding and feeling raw; the LAST thing I wanted anyone to do was touch it. Television ads left me confused over how any guy could stand to have a woman run her hands across his face after a shave. (Of course, I know they&#x27;re models and it&#x27;s advertising, but still...) I have always had a very heavy beard. Shaving every morning is a necessary evil, and if there&#x27;s an important evening event, I have to shave twice a day. (My skin usually needs a couple of days to recover from that.)&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Braun Series 3, hoping that a wet shave electric shaver might be the answer. Is it ever!! I still shave every day, but the closeness of this Braun shaver allows me to shave at 5:00 am and still look good for an evening engagement. My face probably hasn&#x27;t felt this consistently smooth since I was eleven years old. I know this, because I can finally actually touch my own face without it feeling irritated, and definitely without any stubble...at all.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a very heavy beard, sensitive skin, and are tired of frequent cuts, razor burn, and just plain shaving irritation, this shaver is absolutely the answer. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product, it arrived as described so no complaints!  I purchased this as an open item.  The description said &amp;#34;packaging damage&amp;#34; and yes, there was.  I think the initial reason why the package was open is because the cover for the shaver blades does not fit properly, that was not described before hand.</li>
    <li> When the shaver turns on it works very well.  However, after about a week the shaver started acting up.  It turns itself on &amp; off and runs the battery down.  Other times I will have to press the button over and over to get it to turn on.  I used the 3Series for several years and when the old one didn&#x27;t hold its charge anymore I decided to purchase this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Braun replaces it because it shaves really well when it works.</li>
    <li> Use it every morning and I ordered it for short hair and it is nice and quite and great for my short growth.</li>
    <li> A Note Upfront - THE RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT FOIL AND CUTTER IN THE AMAZON AD IS THE WRONG ONE.  You need a 32b, not a 30b (No, that&#x27;s not a bra size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned Norelco, Remington, and Braun, and the Braun is the best.  This is my third Braun series 3.  The Braun shaves closer and with less irritation than either of the other two.  Also, the Remington eats it&#x27;s foils with disturbing regularity--I was routinely replacing them every 3-4 months when the foils ripped.  The Braun foil lasts me more than a year and I have a very heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve had with the Braun--and this has happened with both of my previous razors--the trimmer has broken after 4-5 years, requiring me to buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> Works great! Nice close shave if you take the time to do it .</li>
    <li> I bought this item in Jan/2014 and the trimmer is already broken and its been less then a year and it is not from heavy use. It is uncomfortable to use with broken trimmer.would not order this item again.not sure if its still under waranty</li>
    <li> Good performing razor. Close, comfortable shave and good charge life (at least a week). However, as with my last Braun 3series razors, the charging cord connector does not stay firmly attach to the razor. Very poor design unfortunately carried over from previous models. Overall I am pleased with the shaving performance, option of wet shaving/cleaning and charge life of this and my past Braun razors from Amazon. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the $30ish remington foil shaver for years--having bought 2 to have an identical one in my travel bag (I travel for a living). (This way, I could interchange parts). I had the MS370. (Divorce is final and now that wife can&#x27;t spend everything, I have more than I did.) I splurged for this one ($65 ish and then a $10 off coupon.) (Yeah...big spender!)  I&#x27;ve had this Braun shaver a month, but wow! What a difference! After scouring reviews, I thought this one had the best reviews for the price, so I tried it.) (There was another one similarly priced, though I don&#x27;t remember the brand/model. The Braun had the $10 coupon, so I went with that one.)  I&#x27;m sold. Package says 18mo without a new head--so I hope that happens. In the meantime, shaving in the morning is now actually pleasant--even with a slightly longer growth or moist skin  from the face cream I put on the previous night. Course, the head is only 1 mo old too... (Hmmm.) I don&#x27;t know how much better those $100 plus models are with the good reviews, but having tried this Braun, I fully expect to buy another one for my travel bag now. On a scale from 1-10, my experience went from a 2 with the Remington to a 9.  The new blades/foil replacements are a rip-off, so I kept my Remingtons on longer. The Braun ones cost the same $22 ish. The Remington&#x27;s might have lasted 18mo&#x27;s...but, I&#x27;m now much more inclined to spend a tad more overall to get the great shaving experience. Takes that little bit of dread out of the morning routine--for $30 more of the actual shaver. Good luck.</li>
    <li> This does a good job but I am disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have a case.  I must have missed that point when shopping for a shaver.</li>
    <li> I like the Braun shaver (3Series 340S-4) very much.  It shaves well and is easy to clean.  I usually use just a brush and it cleans up well.  The charge last a very long time.  The only negative is that the shaver won&#x27;t run on when it is being charged, so you cannot use it when the unit is plugged in.</li>
    <li> it will be a good shaver if they didn&#x27;t come with a missing head</li>
    <li> It is reasonable price, good performance. When you choose it, you did not disappointment. It is reasonable price, good performance. When you choose it, you did not disappointment.</li>
    <li> It was a great purchase for my husband who has COPD and finds it difficult for some chores that others consider normal.  Shaving for him was difficult - but no longer.  The Braun was perfect.</li>
    <li> i love it. it is very very good&lt;br /&gt;i want to recommend people to buy,&lt;br /&gt;this quality is so good!</li>
    <li> Great product. Have used this before and it does what I need it to do. Very reliable. Just beware that this seller will require you to sign for the delivery which will delay your shipment a day or two unless you are home during the day. Otherwise this shaver is one of the best. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, but I use a razor after anyway. Just be ready for slow and delayed shipping.</li>
    <li> Been using electric shavers for over forty years and made the mistake of thinking that all were alike. With that in mind, I usually purchased the less expensive shavers, think Remington, etc. I decided to splurge on a better shaver and chose Braun because of consistently good reviews. This model is not the top of the line but what a difference. It&#x27;s gives a great close shave without irritation and very quiet. When you get a more efficient shaver, you spend less time shaving too. Well worth a few extra dollars. What took me so long?!!?</li>
    <li> it met my expectations and I would recommend it to friends. it gives a close shave&lt;br /&gt;and is very easy to maintane</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my 1st electric shaver, (60 years of blades)  I really do not have a base to make a review, other that it works with a little work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is a smooth shave</li>
    <li> It works great.  It gives a nice, smooth shave, and does not&lt;br /&gt;irritate in the least.  It is easy to clean, and is much more than&lt;br /&gt;I expected for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> my husband said it is worth to buy.&lt;br /&gt;BUT when i got it ,the airpouch were all broken，luckily ，the shaver‘s  package was  well.&lt;br /&gt;I think there is a need for greater packaging.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave well after like 20 uses and irritates face. I&#x27;m back to shaving with a DE and I&#x27;m never coming back. It shaved very close at first, but no longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve opened the head and cleaned it with water or the brush after each use and left it open to dry, applying oil once every 5 or so times. Is that bad maintenance? If so, I&#x27;ll give another star.</li>
    <li> Head keeps popping off while shaving.</li>
    <li> Not as close a shave as hoped for, but a lot less mess and a  faster shave.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. I bought this as replacement for my female panasonic shaver. Price about the same, but this is more powerful and much better grip. Blade is sharp. Permanent attached extended blade is good for longer hair trim. Easy grip makes it more maneuver and size right for female use. Female have more coverage and the battery last long enough per use.</li>
    <li> It is good for the price</li>
    <li> The good performance at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;But the noise is.&lt;br /&gt;The price performance is satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Met all my expectations. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  It doesn&#x27;t get extremely close...but I&#x27;m not sure what to really expect from an electric razor.  Doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin, so that&#x27;s a plus.  The battery charges quickly, and lasts a long time.  Many shaves on just one charge.  I also like the &amp;#34;travel guard&amp;#34; that it comes with.  Basically, it&#x27;s a clear, plastic guard that protects the blade end and keeps the power button from being pressed if you have it packed in your luggage.  Overall, a good shaver.</li>
    <li> Really awesome product, gets just as close as a razor. the only thing that sucks, ya gotta work to get your neck real good.</li>
    <li> Functionally fantastic.</li>
    <li> amazing shaver for the price, not very easy to use under the nose.</li>
    <li> My boy friend love it</li>
    <li> Provides a great shave overall but I find it often unable to pick up a straggler here and there.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my hubby, and he loves it. It seems to be fairly good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good quality and I am satisfying this shaver.</li>
    <li> At first, the device performed well.  However, it seems to struggle in tight places such as under the hose and near the side burn area.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the ease of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;However, like other foil razors, the foil wears out quickly and needs to be replaced.  The replacement foils are a bit expensive, which often makes you wonder if it&#x27;s worth replacing.  The only foil razor I really liked was the Remington Classic, but it was discontinued years ago for mysterious marketing reasons.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since switched to a Norelco PT730/46 3500 Shaver, a rotary shaver.  I like this one much better.  I&#x27;ve had rotary styles in the past, and it seems they never wear out-- despite what the documentation states about replacing the heads.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver for the money. I have been using different models of the Panasonic. They are more expensive and definetly not as comfortable or efficient. The instructions suggest shaving before your shower...for a dry shave. I use mine with a shaving gel after the shower and the results are amazing! The Braun is comfortable and leaves the face smooth and without irritation. The actual shave is fast and a charge lasts all week. It charges fast - full charge takes about an hour.  Shaver washes off with hot water...easy.&lt;br /&gt;Once you make friends with this great shaver, I bet you won&#x27;t want to give it up...I don &#x27;t.  Been using it for a few months&lt;br /&gt;And have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Easy to operate, especially for a 91 year old.</li>
    <li> Fair shave, not as good as rotary I have been using okay product</li>
    <li> I tried this razor because I wanted to see if it was better for me then Norelco.  I could not get used to using it.  I ordered new shaving head for my old Norelco and gave this razor to my son.  He likes it.</li>
    <li> This razor went for 30 days without needing a charge - amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He has a course, thick beard and extremely sensitive skin.  He&#x27;s tried other shavers in the past and always ends up hating them.  He&#x27;s been using regular razors and he&#x27;s constantly walking around with toilet paper on his face.  I knew if I found the right shaver, we&#x27;d all be so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for, what seemed like, an eternity to find a shaver that could handle my husband&#x27;s beard but still not cost an arm and a leg and would also last longer than a month.  Well, the first two criteria have been met.  This trims his beard close so he doesn&#x27;t have stubble at 3:00 in the afternoon (one of the things he&#x27;s always hated about electric shavers) yet doesn&#x27;t leave his skin red and cut up.  He also loves that he can use it wet and rinse it off when he&#x27;s done so there aren&#x27;t little hairs laying all over the place (I have to admit....I love that, too!).  It&#x27;s been less than a month so I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product but our fingers are crossed that it&#x27;ll last.  So far, though, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am a previous Braun electric shaver owner but waited much to long to replace my very old model that lasted many, many years.  When the foil started to show missing sections I had to make a decision.  Buy a new foil and cutter block or a new razor.  The cost of the new foil and cutter block made it a &amp;#34;no brainer&amp;#34; to shop for a new razor.  I read many reviews and watched several YouTube reviews on a large range of razors under the $100 mark and this one got the nod.  It shaves so much closer than my old Braun I could hardly believe it!  Absolutely no skin irritation, no need to shave wet nor use Williams Lectric Shave to get a real close shave.  It is much quieter and very ergonomic to hold.  Charging is relatively quick and because it&#x27;s waterproof very easy to clean under hot water.  I don&#x27;t have a really tough beard but I frequently don&#x27;t shave over the weekend and this razor had no problem cutting through nearly three full days of beard.  My Amazon Prime subscription also helped with my decision because of the free two-day shipping.  I highly recommend this model and I&#x27;m sure it will not disappoint!!</li>
    <li> I have always liked Braun razors &amp; this one is great.I am really impressed with it!&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it as it gives a great shave without any discomfort.</li>
    <li> This shaver had a lot of great reviews so i decided to purchase it. the price was right and I had high hopes for it. It doesnt work well in the shower or with any type of shaving cream on my face like i had hoped. it doesnt offer a close shave and does not get neck hairs well at all. I have had this shaver for over 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the two pros i have are the battery life and the warning light for when the battery is getting low.</li>
    <li> My husband really liked this as a christmas gift. He likes the way his hair grows in after shaving, and how close it can get. So far he has no complaints but only giving 4 out of 5 stars because it has only been 1 month.</li>
    <li> Bought a portable Braun and love it. Get this for home use and it&#x27;s 10 times better than another popular brand.</li>
    <li> The beauty of this Braun razor is that you can use it wet or dry - literally. Take it with you in the shower, use it with gel, or use it dry and it works! In fact, if you like a close wet shave you get with a blade, you will be surprised at how close and clean this razor leaves your face when it&#x27;s wet. The battery charge seems to last forever. With at least once-a-day use, sometimes more, the charge lasts a month or more. Extremely easy to keep clean - pop the combined grill and blade top off, rinse it and the main portion of the razor under water, and done. Trimmer is the right size and shape for easy beard/mustache care. Full beard wearers will probably want to get a dedicated beard trimmer for uniform length overall, however.</li>
    <li> Best Braun I have ever had. Smooth, quick and comfortable and a great price. Fit great in the hand and looks cool</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these Braun Series 3 340S-4 shavers at Best Buy to replace my older Braun 8985 shaver. My cleaning station was broken and the 8985 could not be cleaned under running water, so it was a pain every day to keep it clean. I figured getting a newer model that was water proof would be a great idea, boy was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the 340S-4 for about two weeks now and it&#x27;s been an awful experience. Every shave wrecks my skin, and no matter how long I shave for there are STILL stray hairs all over. When used wet, with shaving gel or shaving cream, it is utterly mediocre and takes twice as long as my old razor to finish shaving my face. When used dry it&#x27;s about as good as sandpaper and sharp rocks and there is never a point where I say &amp;#34;Yes, my face is now nice and clean shaven.&amp;#34;. The reason it has so much trouble shaving necks, as many other reviewers have noted, seems to be a core engineering problem. The shaving foils that do the cutting are spaced too far away from each other and have too much plastic bezel surrounding them, which means on any curved surface it has a great deal of trouble making contact with both at the same time. You might as well be shaving with a $20 single foil razor, which coincidentally is about the quality of shave you&#x27;re getting from the 340S-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets 1 star for being water proof and for being easy to clean under the sink. If I could have given it zero stars I would have. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Purchased this razor to replace an older Braun I have had for years.  I looked at several different brands and models and thouught this one looked best for my needs.  Major positives are&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life.  I have a relatively light beard so I can shave for maybe 2 - 3 weeks prior to recharging.  This is similar to my previous Braun which also had an excellent battery.&lt;br /&gt;Good shave.  Not as good as a razor - no electric razor is - but good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;Razor is light to hold and relatively quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I like the red light that comes on to let you know the battery needs to be recharged.  I can still shave several times after the light first comes on.&lt;br /&gt;I like the overall look of the razor.  The combination of blue and black looks neat.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I shutter to think if someone with a tough beard bought this item. I have a light beard and it takes a long time to mow down what little I grow in a 24 hour period.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 4 months, purchased it on Amazon.  I wanted to use the device for awhile before writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me start by saying I was never a big fan of electric shavers; I preferred using a regular razor with gel or foam.  The reasons that led me to making the switch were two-fold:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) razor cartridges are getting so ridiculously expense to the point of absurdity, and they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as the manufacturers claim, especially at the prices they&#x27;re charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I have issues with sensitive skin, razor bumps/irritation, and ingrown hairs on the neck.  I needed something easier on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first requirement was that the electric razor be &#x27;wet-shave&#x27; capable.  The second was a reasonable price.  This entry level Braun model seemed to fit the bill on both counts and got good reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve dry shaved with it a couple times when I was in a rush, and it does a decent job in dry mode.  But I prefer to shave wet.  I find that the shaver works nicely paired with Neutrogena&#x27;s Skin Clearing Shave cream (an actual cream, not gel or foam) on a slightly damp face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was unimpressed, but rather than blame the device right away, I experimented a little bit and found that I was going too fast on the strokes.  To get a good shave with this device, you need to be slow and deliberate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all electrics, it struggles with closeness a little bit on the neck area, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  When used with a cream and on a damp face, it gets most hairs, and most importantly it irritates the skin a lot less.  Sometimes if it misses a few I&#x27;ll make a quick pass with a disposable to get any remaining hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and think the build quality is great for the price.  It could be a little better, but given that this is an entry level device and not one of Braun&#x27;s top end models, it does an admirable job.</li>
    <li> Does a great job for the money.</li>
    <li> Great electric razor. Hubby loves it!</li>
    <li> This replaced an old Panasonic ES8243 . It cost me less than replacing the blades and foil. So far so good</li>
    <li> Bought the razor too replace a rotary from a different manufacturer because I heard good things about it. Well I will not be saying anything good about it. I&#x27;m a disabled photographer trying to make it doing wildlife and landscape work so most of the time I don&#x27;t have access to water for shaving so electric is a must. But this razor leaves hair every where especially under the chin. Not being an IT guy I have no use for a neck beard so I can&#x27;t recommend this razor at all. When I can afford it I will be going back to a rotory.</li>
    <li> I bought this and in less than 4 months the on/off push button is no longer functioning and will not start.  Shaving was not as close or smooth over the skin as my old Norelco circular style, which eventually broke after about 10 years of usage (I even replaced it with new set of AA batteries) and kept working.  The original foil also was still cutting well.  Even though I am still under warrenty I have bought another Norelco and don&#x27;t even care to get this 3series Braun back to service center.</li>
    <li> bought this in june 2015. it gives very ordinary shave. leaves hairs after shaving 5 minutes. i just bought razor from harry&#x27;s for $10 and it gives an outstanding shave. excellent german shaving blades. i feel that i wasted $39 FOR THE BRAUN SHAVER. i had a phillips norelco which gave an excellent electric shave however when i bought the replacement cartridge it was unsatisfactory. can&#x27;t believe the difference between harry&#x27;s &amp; braun in price &amp; performance.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get the hair on my neck that lays down and grows different directions. Otherwise it works.</li>
    <li> I certainly enjoyed the same day delivery.  The shaver itself does a decent job.  I suppose that after shaving with blades for 40 years it will take me a bit to get used to using an electric again.  It does a nice job, not as close as a blade but a fine job.  I don&#x27;t think that you can beat it for the price.  Easy to clean.  A full charge lasts two to three weeks.  Plus it charges very quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor for wet or dry use.  Cuts closer than my old Braun.</li>
    <li> Husband really liked it!</li>
    <li> The rear foil randomly starts violently shaking and making a loud raucous grinding sound.  Sometimes it stops grinding when I turn it off and then on, or push on the foil, or take off the head and replace it, or clean it; sometimes it continues despite my attempts to fix it, and the grinding will randomly stop.  It is 3 days past the Amazon return cutoff, so I must return it on my dime to Braun and wait 10 weeks for a refund.  I will go back to the Panasonic brand.  I had a Panasonic that lasted 12 years and the shave was closer.  That beats the heck out of Braun.</li>
    <li> Several problems with this shaver.  Main issues is that it will not turn on while it is in charge mode.  Second issue is that it is pretty weak. I have to finish off with a blade.  I would not suggest buying this... spend a little more and buy a proper shaver.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me but man this thing takes spoil long to shave with, you have to go over and over to get a clean shave, don&#x27;t use it at all</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t shave with this :-(.</li>
    <li> Good and close shave.  Have only used it dry.  Will try it wet soon. So far satisfies with the shaver</li>
    <li> Electric shaver uses first but cutting force is good fairly and is satisfied fairly in waterproof function price range ratio efficiency is fine price range ratio efficiency is fine price range ratio efficiency is fine</li>
    <li> Completely ineffective. The razor&#x27;s inability to cut hair consistently requires so many passes that it negates any time benefit from using an electric razor. It is also extraordinarily irritating. Very disappointed, Braun should be ashamed of this product.</li>
    <li> First electric razor for an older man and I am impressed with this unit. Good charge holding capacity and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Gives a clean shave, no bumps.  My hubby loves it and loses his mind when it is misplaced.  It has become a necessity to him.</li>
    <li> My husband switched to electric due to the high cost of standard blades now.  He uses this with shaving lotion and says it works better than any of those crazy expensive blades.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 9/3/2014: The razor is still working fine ,however, I have begun to wish for a cleaning device for it, its incredibly hard to clean the \\&quot;combi\\&quot; blade well to get all the hair removed, it still works fine, its just a matter of sanitation. Also I&#x27;ve realized this works best if you use it every day contrary to the manuals recommendation of waiting 2-3 days between shaves, it takes longer to get rid of all the hair in that 2-3 day situation requiring multiple passes. However every day cutting my face stays smooth of almost all stubble. I also noticed after 3 days of not using it while I was away on a trip that the charging contacts had a green \\&quot;rust\\&quot; or oxidation on them. I&#x27;m not sure where that came from because I do my best to dry the shaver out, it still charges and runs fine, but that&#x27;s something I have to look into further down the road. I still think it&#x27;s good but could probably use a bit more power to the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I originally bought this was because so far my entire life I&#x27;ve used disposable razors (my entire life shaving has only been like 5-6 years lol), and for some reason kept cutting my face. I thought of this as a great alternative, I had also heard of Brauns superior build quality. I had grown some serious stubble (+4 days) and put it to the test. It takes quite a bit longer than a normal razor, but the outcome is better, at least for me I got no irritation, and no bumps because I used it with a cooling shaving cream. Also with this, unlike normal razors you go against the grain, and if you have any tight corners in your face it will miss those and you have to pass them again, hence why it probably takes slightly longer when you first use it. However it could be a time saver, if you use it in the shower. It feels very nice in the hand, it&#x27;s very lightweight, and I feel it could last much more than 2-3 years. It also comes with a cleaning brush and machine oil for it. A slight recommendation would be up the motors power a bit, I feel it wouldn&#x27;t have missed stubble if it had a bit more power too it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: The shipping for this in the Philadelphia area SUCKED!! Google A-1 international courier service amazon and you&#x27;ll see all the bad reviews, it was guaranteed for me at 8:00 pm that night, and got it close to midnight when a suspicious unmarked car parked in front of my mailbox and shove the box in the mailbox as tight as possible, and proceeded to call me from an unknown number saying my amazon package had been delivered.

    <li> Quiet, smooth shaving and long lived battery charge. Every feature seems well designed and tight fitting. More like Apple would have designed.</li>
    <li> in short, bad at wet condition; ok in dry condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I stopped to use electrical shaver 12 years ago since I hate the painful feel after shave. I use traditional disposable 2 blades shaver ever since. They serve me good, but the only thing is I&#x27;m not a careful shaver that I always missed some spots, and I have to go back and clean these tiny area out again.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get this entry level shaver since there is a discount. After using it, I started to know what most people said in the review is true. It can&#x27;t be as clean as traditional knife one. this shaver nips less skin but still occasionally this shaver will do it. To me, I miss more spots than before. I have to repeatedly push the shaver back and forth to remove these short hairs. It&#x27;s kinda painful, physically and mentally, to do it. I think under wet condition, I can&#x27;t shave better than the dry condition. I think the problem is when my skin is wet or with shaving foam, the stainless steel web and my skin has huge friction so that when I push the blade alone my skin, it starts leaping a little. I did try to pull my face a little to solve this issue, but it didn&#x27;t help. It just leaping when I push/pull forward (always 90 degrees blade to skin surface). I also tried with all angels (blade to skin), nothing really helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consider I already forgot how good/bad electronic shaver was, I think 3 stars is fair for this one. Even though I still miss lots spots, more painful after-shave skin and need to spend more time in shaving, I don&#x27;t need to apply foam and wash face again as traditional blade method.</li>
    <li> Love the Braun. Had a Norelco, again, but you cant beat the reliability and overall quality of the Braun.</li>
    <li> Works really well especially for someone who doesn&#x27;t shave every day.  Does not irritate me, cuts longish beards better than most.</li>
    <li> This a good, solid shaver. It is very smoothe and seems to do a decent job. I still prefer the series 1 because it seems to be easier to use on my face. My wife likes the 3 series better for her legs and underarms though, so she has now inherited it.</li>
    <li> Before buying any electric razor do your homework, do you shave everyday? how thick is your beard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to shave everyday, my previous electric razor was only a single foil and it felt like it was ripping every hair out of my face! manually shaving would give me a really close shave but later on that day when the hair starts to grow back my skin would feel itchy and irritable and I would end up scratching my neck and then wouldn&#x27;t be able to shave the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, close shave, no pain (cant even feel the hairs being removed) and most importantly no irritation later that day.</li>
    <li> I bought this model to replace my fairly old Braun 7526. I had been buying replacement heads for that one through the years but i thought i might save money in the end by just getting a new shaver instead, also because the battery in my old shaver wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long any more. Well unfortunately this 340S-4 does not do quite the same job as my 7526. Even with old foil and cutters the 7526 still gives a quicker and smoother result than the 340S-4. It seems to take almost twice as long to get the same smooth result with this shaver than with my old one. I do like the overall operation of this new shaver and the fact that it&#x27;s quite compact, so i will hold on to it and it will probably become my shaver for traveling. But in the mean time i did order a new set of foil and heads again for my old 7526 which i won&#x27;t retire for a while.</li>
    <li> My son is loving this, works great for him. Much easier than razor blades and more of a bargin now he is headed to college.</li>
    <li> wirered for u s a  not u k  returned</li>
    <li> I like it, it does the job with out any issues, haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how it lasts though.</li>
    <li> Price performance is good, except that the thickness of the thin and thick beard who I was delivered. Things are good.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected...its a Braun(duh)</li>
    <li> Bought it for my Dad - he says it&#x27;s the best! So, we bought one for his nephew.</li>
    <li> Very good product, love it!</li>
    <li> To get a good beard, you will need to have time, because is necessary to pass much time in the same point to get a good job.</li>
    <li> I had never used an electric shaver before. I sent for this Braun from Amazon and received it within a few days. I used it and was pleased. It did a very good job. I will not go back to the old way of shaving.</li>
    <li> works very well  the small trimmer could be better</li>
    <li> This Braun 340S-4 is so much better than my previous Braun shaver.  The older version (5776) was flimsier. Compared with the older 5776, the construction of the 340S-4 is superior in every way.  The Cutter-Foil Cartridge is solidly designed albeit expensive.  The 5776&#x27;s Cartridge was a mess and the trimmer kept disconnecting from the main body of the shaver.  I am glad that Braun fixed this in the 340S-4 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave every day, and I shave my full head, not just my face.  I find this Braun 340S-4 to be very comfortable, close shaving, well made and non-irritating.  I have nothing to say against this shaver, but it IS on the pricy side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to rework some areas of my head and face to get the shave that I want, but I so far have not seen any shaver that did better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get three shaves from a single charge which is better than the 5776 did, but I miss the fact that the 5776 allowed me to shave while charging, which the newer 340S-4 does not (it will not charge &amp; shave at the same time).  Beware, if you sometimes fail to charge your shaver, you may get half a shave.  There is a red warning light though, and you probably have a full shave left even when it comes on, but do not ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The engineering of the 340S-4 seems well thought out and built to last, but only time will tell.  I got about a year and a half to two years of life from my previous Braun shavers.  The feature that spells certain death for the Braun shavers has been the hinge-joint which allows the shaver head to swivel as you perform you shave.  It eventually breaks rendering the shaver useless.  This doubtful advantage has been thankfully removed in the 340S-4. From past experience, I have noticed that recharge life will gradually shorten over time until the shaver becomes next to useless as well, unless you can recharge while shaving. This is normal for any rechargeable battery, but there is no way to replace this battery in the Braun shavers, so this may be the new Achilles heal of the 340S-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not miss the black carry case of the older shavers because the carry case was poorly designed anyway and would break into two pieces at the flimsy hinge.  Also the case would soon warp so that the two halves did not properly align after only a few months of use.  This 340S-4 does not have a carry case at all but rather a plastic head cover which is one piece and pretty much gets the job of protection done.</li>
    <li> Now my son can stop using mine! :-)</li>
    <li> try and you will be a fan great value too. will never go back to any other, is the best thing for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly. Product has a long battery life, don&#x27;t have to charge it every day. And it does a close stave without the need of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I just love this shaver. It gives a nice and close shave. Glides on my face seamlessly. Feels like running a feather across my face.&lt;br /&gt;Best shaver I have owned. (Y)</li>
    <li> very very poor shave on 3day beard</li>
    <li> Braun Series 3-340s Wet &amp; Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver 1 Count</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good at this price</li>
    <li> shaves at most 75% of the hair on my face  leaving random hairs all over after many, many passes..like shaving with a cell phone on vibrate.....ended up having to use my regular blade razor to fix the mess it made...junk..waste of 70 bucks or whatever it was I spent on it.....looks all fancy and high tech when you unbox it too....it&#x27;s junk.</li>
    <li> Does not do a good job on the neck</li>
    <li> Since I began shaving some 50 years ago, the shavers have mostly all been Philips/Norelcos. Norelcos are reliable, but insufficient for a person with a heavy beard and sensitive facial skin, especially in the winter months. This Braun 3-340s is superior in all respects at 25% the asking price compared to Norelco&#x27;s latest high-end electric razors.  The best shave is still a disposable multi- bladed razor ranging from a BIC to Gillette. Check the 340s vs the 380s. I can see no reason to spend the extra money for 380s.</li>
    <li> Does a great job wet or dry shave</li>
    <li> Even more than I expected.  Very good shaves and easy to care for.</li>
    <li> as described, best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Good price and beautiful appearance. It&#x27;s used 7 days shipping to China, very fast. But the item is made in China -_-||</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of those Braun shavers with the Clean and Renew and hated the mess and smell of that system. Tossed that out, replaced it with this simpler shaver and actually it&#x27;s way better, closer shave, way smaller charging base. I use it to shave my head and face, so it gets a lot of use daily. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, provides a shave as close a fresh razor.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get all of my hairs. I&#x27;m not sure any electric will. I have to make several passes and end up as tender as a blade. Which was what I was hoping to avoid.</li>
    <li> Great. Good shave &amp; very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It is nice and does what it suppose to do.  Shave clean without much hassle.  However, it is a bit bulky and noisy which is tolerable if you do not mind.</li>
    <li> The shaver is very sturdy. I like the feel of it. Also the quality of the shave is better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before. It has a close and comfortable shave. Very easy to wash. Highly recommend to anyone who like to shave often.</li>
    <li> Does a pretty good job.  I shave before I shower, then after the shower i put shaving soap on and shave again.  This helps get any extra stubble cut.</li>
    <li> Replacing a 10 year old Panasonic Wet-Dry and if it lasts as long, will be well-satisfied. So far, provides a decent shave for an electric (nothing is as good as a blade, no matter what any of them say), works well and looks nice...about what I expected for the money, as I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.</li>
    <li> It is my first shaver. I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> As described, amazing shave, performed well, fits my needs exactly</li>
    <li> I have owned two of these. Both died in about 3 months. They just stopped working. I sent the first one back for warranty repair. It came back, and worked great for 8 weeks. Then it died again.  Rather than pay the postage to send it back again, I bought a new one since there was a sale/special on it.  It died in 3 months. I loved the shave when they worked, but they just are very poorly made. I will not buy a third.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite Father&#x27;s Day gift.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun for my husband as a gift. He has used different rotary shavers before but has gone back to regular shaving so I thought the foil blade might be better. He uses shaving cream so wet &amp; dry was a plus. He hasn&#x27;t gotten any irritation which he couldn&#x27;t be happier with. I&#x27;m quite pleased &amp; he uses it daily. Thank you for a great product. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does a pretty good job. It doesn&#x27;t usually get everything on my neck, but I&#x27;d imagine some people have better success. I now use a safety razor ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RBF1PO/ ) , but still use the braun when i need a quick trim.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and my dad loves it.</li>
    <li> Just an ordinary product, nothing special but suitable for daily use. Especially, this is 110-240V voltage which is much better than their Oral hygiene products.</li>
    <li> it is as good as the previous Braun I have used. I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor.  U would recommend it to anyone who uses an electric razor.  It gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would say this about an electric razor, but this thing shaves closer than my Fusion. Can&#x27;t really say any more than that.</li>
    <li> I got this just over three weeks ago and have just finished up a 21 day review. I went from shaving maybe 2x a week to shaving every day and absolutely love this thing. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 out of 5 stars is that it did cause a slight bit of razor burn on the back of my neck (I am balding, so I shave my head and back of my neck, too) when I shaved with shaving lotion - tried various types.&lt;br /&gt;You can check out videos I posted for the review on YouTube, too.&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLSALdGExeAvAAgvao1e91VZKSqby_auOB</li>
    <li> this is the second Braun 3 series I&#x27;ve owned.  Very disappointed in this one.  Doesn&#x27;t give a close shave without multiple passes over the areas of my face and difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> nice product. But i don&#x27;t know how to use the liquid in the plastic bottle. It should be used on the net or cutter??</li>
    <li> A great shaver for a reasonable price. Close, painfree shave and a long lasting charge.</li>
    <li> Excellent. My 1st real electric shaver. As an African American man I&#x27;ve always had issues with razor bumps and ingrown hairs. Man this helps with that as long as I shave every 2-3 days. Before just using Andis to shave with I could never get a close shave. The conveince of wet/dry use is great also. Makes shaving qucik and easy.</li>
    <li> feels awesome. hefty and smooth. gets my weak stubble nice and smooth</li>
    <li> An excellent shaver. Clean and efficient. I couldn&#x27;t believe the price. Have used Braun shavers for years and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Does not give a close shave, would not recommend.</li>
    <li> very nice，thank amazon</li>
    <li> Shaves well and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband and so far it is 5-star.  It&#x27;s exactly what we expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Great shave !  Holds a charge really good, multiple shaves on a single charge.</li>
    <li> With the price less than $50, I really think that cannot buy one better than this in the world.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t shave real close</li>
    <li> Probably should have bought a nicer one...doesn&#x27;t work that great, takes way longer than just shaving.  ugh, it&#x27;s a lose, lose...  thank goodness its No-shave-November.</li>
    <li> Have a  Braun--loved it--but it&#x27;s time has come to be replaced--lasted me 15 years-- it is time for a new one</li>
    <li> Not as close of a shave as I was hoping to obtain.</li>
    <li> This a gift, Uncle like it very much.</li>
    <li> Does a good job. As good or better than any other electric shaver I have used.</li>
    <li> Simply the best for me. I have been using Braun for many years. Braun makes it better and better. And Amazon let me use my credit card points.</li>
    <li> My old Braun&#x27;s foils lasted 18+ months and the battered shaver still works after 20? years.  I am very happy with the Braun 3Series 340S-4 that I bought.  Close shave but comfortable.  Not loud.</li>
    <li> In the past few years I&#x27;ve owned a Panasonic wet-dry \\&quot;linear motor\\&quot; razor and a Norelco HQ9-head rotary. The Panasonic cut very close, but was somewhat loud and would sometimes miss some neck stubble, leaving scattered whiskers to grow longer and longer. The Norelco was very quiet and got the stubs, but didn&#x27;t give as close a shave as the Panny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 340S-4 shaves close, almost as closely as the Panasonic, but is quieter, and it picks up neck stubble well. However, it&#x27;s still very audible from the next room, unlike the Norelco. So far I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks on its first charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you need the very quiet operation of a rotary, this razor is a fine choice. The more expensive versions in the Braun \\&quot;S\\&quot; line appear to be built slightly \\&quot;prettier\\&quot; but they have features I&#x27;ve tried before and don&#x27;t want to pay for again (a \\&quot;cleaning system\\&quot; base). The 340S rinses clean in just a few seconds under the tap.</li>
    <li> Made a nice gift for a senior</li>
    <li> Last month I bought the Old Spice version of this model in red (just because it was a few dollars less when I found it), and to date, it is the best shaver I have used. I am a 58 year-old man. Not all beards and skin types are alike, and mine is of the heavy bristle (now even more stubbornly so, as most of it is gray) growing out of sensitive skin. I shave my head, too. Although these machines are developed for bristle, they work well on hair as well. My last shaver was a spaceship, which I decided to replace when it developed an extra buzzing noise and popped a spring from the cutter/foil assembly. Over-engineered with 5 heads and a several hundred-dollar price tag. It&#x27;s not rocket science, lads - it&#x27;s face-shaving, for goodness&#x27; sake! The BRAUN 340-s 4 is quieter, smoother, more compact, and cheaper than the competition. You could spend more on a higher model of BRAUN, but I wouldn&#x27;t. If your wrist doesn&#x27;t work, you might need a shaver that boasts flexing or sliding heads that &#x27;conform to the contours of your face&#x27;, or even &#x27;custom&#x27; or &#x27;comfort&#x27; settings for different beard/skin types. Don&#x27;t be taken in! This is a man&#x27;s shaving tool. Why pay more?</li>
    <li> Very good razor. I get a nice clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R.O.</li>
    <li> For the price, this razor is awesome!!</li>
    <li> Tore my skin up!  If I had kept the box I would return it.  Bad buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as a Remington I own before. Have to pass several times to leave the face without hair.</li>
    <li> Shaver arrived today. The charging cord kept falling out of the charging stand, obviously a manufacturing defect.&lt;br /&gt;So, unless I was really unlucky, this was likely a bad production run which Amazon probably needs to sort out&lt;br /&gt;with Braun to avoid a bunch of unhappy customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is an alternative to a return, if you happen to have the older model 320s-4, with a charger cord that&lt;br /&gt;plugged directly into the shaver. That cord fits the 340s-4 charging stand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> For about 30 years I have used the most famous rotary razor and finally got tired of having to go over my neck 4 and 5 times to get a good shave. First time with the braun and now I have finally found a great shave with no complaints!</li>
    <li> Received it in plenty of time and it works great!</li>
    <li> I moved from a older 5 series and this is head and shoulders above that for me. Works well dry haven&#x27;t tried wet yet. Can&#x27;t see why I would buy a more expensive model.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to find an electric shaver that I like but this one works great! I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun razor. I use it everyday. Well made and a great price.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it. I bought for him as a gift and he use it often.</li>
    <li> So far works pretty good. Doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as my previous Braun.  Maybe I can change the blades. This is very light weight. Compared to my previous one this one feels cheap but seems to do the job. I had my old one for over end years. I&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts. Gave 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as well as my old one even with older blades so it takes longer to shave.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver,thought I was getting a shaver comparable to Norelco but am disappointed. The razor would NOT shave at all. I got a light beard, That I been shaving 70 years. Would not recommend to any body.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace a really old and, at the time, much more expensive Braun after the power supply died and they stopped selling replacements.  I found this shaver to feel smoother, while still getting the job done.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, especially as I didn&#x27;t have to buy it in a &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; with those cartridges that were designed for profit and nothing more.</li>
    <li> Shaves as close to a razor (but not as close) as any electric shave I have used. It works great on dry skin and it works well in the shower. The battery life is good so far. I use it for about a week or so before I have to recharge.</li>
    <li> It works great. It can provide you with a smooth shave that sometimes a regular razor will not provide. It is great if you are very white, and you are allergic, or your skin gets too red when you use shaving creams. With the electric shaver you do not need a shaving cream, and get a decent shave without having to deal with allergic reactions, or your skin becoming red.</li>
    <li> Great quality &amp; great performance! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this almost one month for just one full charge.</li>
    <li> Outstanding close shave</li>
    <li> I hesitated for years over an electric shaver because I remember over 10 years I used one and it messed up my face so bad, I did some research, read some of the reviews and decided to give it a go since so many people said that it didn&#x27;t irritate. Finally!! It doesn&#x27;t irritate at all!! It works great. I would say it grabs 98% of the hair, sometimes a few single hairs are left behind and even with running it over them, they still don&#x27;t get cut, so I just grab the razor, again this is for a few hairs considering all the individual hairs on your face. The back trimmer works great, if you need to get a close trim but not completely smooth. The charge lasts a really long time, I sometimes charge it sometimes don&#x27;t in between, I have never HAD to charge it because it was dying. Great product, my only regret was waiting so long to get it. I got it when it was 60 or 80 dollars about 6 months ago, can&#x27;t believe the price dropped so low.</li>
    <li> Great price . Received item in just five days from back East.  Braun electric shavers I know their value as I have used them for over thirty years and am happy with them.  Just when you think that they cannot improve a basic shaver, guess what?  They can.  Very smooth shave with gel and foam - I also have used dry and the technology is great.  The only down side which by the way  is true for most electric shavers is that after about two years you need to replace the cutting head and foil and Braun replacement parts are pricey - it almost pays to just buy a new shaver.</li>
    <li> after 6+ months use, i love this one.  Works way better (closer shave) than my older Braun, which i also liked at the time.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied buying this shaver. I didn&#x27;t know electic shavers were this good. I recently purhased a Remington but sent it back for return. I read about this shaver and its awesome! Very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Given 5 stars as first off it was delivered on time and faster than I thought. Secondly, the blade mowed every hair with one shave. This helps to save time for those who shave every morning.</li>
    <li> My husband is comfortable writing the first time an electric razor and say yes.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, good price and item just as described!</li>
    <li> Good close shave for an electric razor. It hugs the face well and gets closer than I expected. The battery is very good. I have had it several weeks and I have not had to charge it yet. It is easy to clean and does a great job for the price. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Does not shave as close as my old Remington did, but it does a decent job.</li>
    <li> my father like product</li>
    <li> It has a nice close shave with minimal maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my skill and face daily without problem....  Now if Braun could make one that is more like the Jetsons to do the work for me I might add a 6th star.</li>
    <li> I used the Braun 4 times before I returned to my old razor..</li>
    <li> Just one word comes in mind. Wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly. In my opinion, it shaves closer that the Gillette Fusion.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it wet only dry but it&#x27;s nice  I used to get ingrown hairs with my ol electric all the time and haven&#x27;t had As many with this (still a few)</li>
    <li> Very sturdy construction, ergonomically comfortable to hold.  Cleans off very easily and a full charge lasts about two weeks for me, with shaves every two or three days.  Doesn&#x27;t shave a close as a manual razor, but does a good job.  If you don&#x27;t need the &amp;#34;wet/dry&amp;#34; feature there are lower models that shave just as good.</li>
    <li> great razor for the price. very happy.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t bring myself to run any electrical device under the tap, so I only use it dry.  It does a nice job and it&#x27;s surprisingly quiet.  The last BRAUN shaver I had lasted nearly 20 years.  I&#x27;m looking forward to another long-term relationship with this new one.  I just hope it has a good sense of humor and likes long walks on the beach.</li>
    <li> My last electric shaver wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and I needed a new one.  Found this one, the price was right, the features were right and delivery was in excellent time</li>
    <li> This shaver out performed the last five shavers I have had and I continue to be impressed with the close shave, both wet and dry, it gives me</li>
    <li> I have an older Braun and was hoping to improve on its performance with this one.&lt;br /&gt;This is more comfortable to shave with, produces a closer shave and is perceptibly quieter.&lt;br /&gt;Can you say &amp;#34;Happy Camper&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend it? A resounding YES!</li>
    <li> I have used an electric shaver for more than twenty years.  And, over the years, I have acquired several shavers, each of which had its strong points as well as its weaker ones.  For example, Hitachi makes shavers with roller blades much like the manual push lawnmowers, and Norelco makes the rotary shavers.  The Hitachi is great for one-day growths, but doesn&#x27;t do all that well with longer hairs.  The Norelco (Philips), on the other hand, does a great job with longer hairs, but for me, at least, is not the greatest with a one-day growth.  And, finally, my favorite was a Grundig shaver, but the sliding switch just broke, and new ones are no longer available in the U.S.A., just in Europe.  So, I am always so grateful to other reviewers on Amazon, because I can often get a good idea from them before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the case with this Braun shaver (also because I have had good service from assorted Braun kitchen gadgets).  This shaver gets the longer and the shorter facial and neck hairs equally well.  The trimmer cuts even longer hairs that crop up low on my neck without irritating the skin.  I opted for the model that works in the shower, and I have used it on my wet face just after the shower for a very close shave.  The rubber non-slip skin that encloses the shaver is a huge plus.  All-in-all, this is as perfect a shaver as I could hope for. I recommend this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Footnote: Be sure to order the Braun 32b Series 3 Combi Replacement Pack.  It has the randomly spaced holes, whereas the shaver comes with regularly spaced holes.  I expect that when I have to replace the one-piece head with the Braun 32b Series 3 Combi Replacement Pack, I will get as good or better shave.</li>
    <li> I have a medium to light beard and this seems to cut well with a slow-moderate speed, but seems slightly underpowered compared to Panasonics in the same $$ range.  Easy to bog-down.  Overall, I have been more impressed with the Pannys I have owned, and would buy a Panasonic if I could do it over, as their motors seem higher torque.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to try something other than my 10yo Remmington foil shaver, but the newer Remmingtons suck.&lt;br /&gt;I got this for Father&#x27;s Day and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I owned a Remington electric shaver for a couple of months. It was difficult to use it without it irritating the skin on my face. So, I purchased the Braun 340S and have been happy since.</li>
    <li> my panasonic ES4026 was having a tough time making it through a shave on a full charge, so it was time. I always liked the foil razors felt like a better shave to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What drew me to the braun was the middle blades as I always had kooky neck hairs n panasonic could never get them, and the braun looked liked it could handle em. so far so good almost bladelike, and trimmer is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only my first couple shaves so I will update later. For shavers under 100$ I think this is a great razor n I did a lot of reviews of what I could get locally.</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun shaver advocate for years. I found the series 3 340-s model to be excellent. Faster shave and easy to clean. Hopefully I will not have problems with the screens that were delicate and needed to be replaced frequently</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two Panasonic wet-dry shavers before this and I always had to do some touch-ups with a conventional razor, no matter how carefully I shave. With the Braun, I don&#x27;t have to do this. It provides a very comfortable and close shave... I have no hesitations about recommending this shaver, if you are a fan of wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco rotary shavers since last century, and decided it was time for a change.  My previous shaver was spinning at a diminished speed, so although this Braun shaves closer than expected, I don&#x27;t know how it compares to a NEW Norelco.  But the Braun is good, and is worth the price.  Only complaint is noise, which is noticeably louder than my previous shavers.</li>
    <li> After years of buying cheap electric shavers I decided to break down a try a Braun, but thought I&#x27;d start with an \\&quot;inexpensive\\&quot; one.  After reading many reviews, I settled on a shaver that can be used in the shower and does not have the self-cleaning feature.  Many reviews of the shavers with the self cleaning seemed less than satisfactory.  And I didn&#x27;t want to have to buy the pricey cleaning cartridges every few months.&lt;br /&gt;I had high expectations for this device and after a month of use it has far exceeded my high expectations.  It is built solidly, feels good in the hand even when wet, and gives a shave as close as a blade but without the irritation. The trimmer feature is excellent as well.  I successfully hacked an uneven piece of my mustache off expecting it to perform like my previous Remington piece of junk.  I only use it for my facial region so I can&#x27;t comment on how it would work on a shaved noggin or other body parts.&lt;br /&gt;There were a couple of reviews expressing dissatisfaction about the battery life.  I suspect that those commentators did not read the instructions regarding the initial battery charge/discharge procedure. The instructions are clear and concise (once you get past the obligatory idiot warnings like &#x27;not intended for use in woodworking projects&#x27;). Just follow the simple instructions and you should have a long and happy life of shaving. There were other comments about it being noisy.  If you consider a slight hum to be noisy, you&#x27;re spending too much time listening to Barry Manilow music.  My Remington sounded like a weed whacker compared to this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine that the really expensive shaver models would be any better than this so save your money and just buy this one! I don&#x27;t typically give anything 5 stars but I honestly can&#x27;t find a fault with this unit. If I do, I&#x27;ll adjust my review accordingly at that time.</li>
    <li> Nice razor. Shaves well.  Holds charge well. Read some reviews complaining of noise, but it seems quiet enough to me.</li>
    <li> The shaver feels like a quality product and the performance has been great. The product comes with a charging stand but the cord can also be plugged directly into the shaver. This is a huge plus because some shavers force the owner to use a charging stand or station. This shaver is also very easy to clean compared to other similar products. In the end, this is one of the best shavers at this price range. I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Still using this thing daily.  I have had it for 2 years.  Nice product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple of other model of Braun Shavers... and I LOVE THIS ONE!  Love it, love it, love it!&lt;br /&gt;It does such a better job.  I cut my shaving time by almost half!  Feels better.  I could just go on and on!  ;-)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenager and the jury is still out.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, he is happy to use it most days, but when it is really important to be clean-shaven, he goes back to the trusty old razor.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe he will get better at using this, but isn&#x27;t the point of getting something &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; that you won&#x27;t have to get better at it before it works for you?</li>
    <li> It does cut through a few days growth like it says in the description, but beyond that I&#x27;m fairly unimpressed. It does not shave as close as my old cheaper Braun single blade electric razor, and it chews up my face more. End result is less smooth, more irritated shave. I feel like 3 stars is a little generous for this product, but 2 stars is a little harsh, 2.5 stars is about where I stand on this.</li>
    <li> it doesnot give a close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this Braun Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It works as advertised and is priced very reasonably for an electric shaver of this quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using disposable 3 blade razors for years in the shower, and this Braun shaver is just as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;It is very comfortable on my skin and causes no irritation whatsoever, unlike some of the disposable (i.e. BIC) razors I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;An easy five star review.</li>
    <li> this product came when it stated it would, which is always welcome. the shave i get from this is very smooth,all the curves of my face get a good shave. clean up is fast and easy. i am just sorry i cannot give this 6 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple weeks, and it doesn&#x27;t give nearly as good a shave as the old cheap Remington it was replacing. I&#x27;ve tried wet, dry, before and after washing my face, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. It requires multiple passes to get a serviceable shave on my cheeks and jaw, but the neck and chin always have some fairly long stubble. Maybe my stubble just doesn&#x27;t suit this shaver, so I&#x27;m going back to a rotary model.</li>
    <li> Outstanding. Will use Amazon from now on. Mahalo.</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst razor on the planet, very unhappy. Right out of the box I put it on the charger, when fully charged I started shaving, I might as well shaved with a butter knife. I had to chase after it with a safety razor just to finish the job. For $80 bucks, I should have had a better shave than this. Never again will I buy a Braun razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver feels fine, and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation which is great. However, does not shave my neck well at all, I can shave my face with this. Fairly acceptable.</li>
    <li> Love my new Braun 3-340 razor.  It is smooth, and does a close shave with no irritation.  It holds a charge for several days.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver!!! It felt as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom after my first use. You cannot go work with a Braun shaver. You will love it like I am right now. Love the styling and everything else about this shaver. This shaver also cut my time in half it takes me to shave with a manual one. A shaver from Braun is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED in my book if you are shopping for a smooth close shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Braun!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 4.5 stars.  It only has one little thing I wish was better.  I&#x27;ve used cheaper Remington flat screen electrics most of my life.  I liked that I could get a very close shave with them, but the downside was that I often had irritated skin with red bumps.  That will never happen with this razor.  It&#x27;s very comfortable, and quite a bit more quiet than my last Remington.  The popup trimmer is so much better there isn&#x27;t any comparison.  The only problem is I have to spend a lot more time going over the same area if I want as close a shave as I am used to.  However, the more I use this razor, the better I like it.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I only use it dry and haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet.  It might shave a lot closer wet.</li>
    <li> It is very satisfying. This is a well shaved beard.</li>
    <li> My husband is picky but loves this!!!!</li>
    <li> Would have gotten 5 if it gave a closer shave</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried all the other electric shavers out their on the market, but this one is great! I shave my head and my face with this and they are both as smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass when I&#x27;m done and in doing both the battery has never died or even been close. I haven&#x27;t taken it in any shower so can&#x27;t comment on the wet dry part but I was always a shaving cream and razor guy for my whole life but not anymore!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping..</li>
    <li> Battery lasts forever on a charge. Great smooth shave. Has one of the less expensive models earlier. The upgrade was well worth it.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Works fine.</li>
    <li> Even though I had a Braun 8000 series for nearly 10 years, this one compares very closely to the previous shaver, in terms of performance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this model shaver from Wallyworld, but wanted to share my quick down and dirty review here, as Amazon is where I gathered my initial info while standing in the aisle.  At the time I didnt have Prime, and I needed it ASAP rather than a few days away.  So far, I&#x27;ve owned it 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this is my first real electric.  I&#x27;ve had other generic travel foil shavers, but nothing of substantial sturdiness.  This is one sturdy unit.  It has survived several drops in the shower without any issue.  You cant even visually tell its fallen to the floor.  Still hums like day one.  All well and good.  I will say, like most other reviewers, it does take several passes to get a smooth cut, especially on the neck.  I&#x27;ve found it easiest to hold the razor so its foils are up and down (perpendicular to the floor), tilt my head back, and make good horizontal swipes like I am trying to slice my own neck.  That motion gets the best results with me.  It might work with you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right, continuing the review...battery life is sweet.  I charge it once a week, and shave about 7 minutes a day, 6 days a week...sometimes wet in the shower, or dry before I get in....depending on the previous day&#x27;s growth.  I&#x27;d say it does much better dry than wet, but the unit it at home in either environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ugly is the head replacement.  You read in the manuals to replace the cutting head every 18 months.  I must have some radioactive diamond coated whiskers on my face, because my head began to have issues keeping up at month #6.  I&#x27;ve dealt with it, and attempted to clean and oil the thing to no avail for the last two months.  I broke down and spent the $27 for a new head today, and it went to down like it was day one all over again...which is what prompted me to write this review.  Having to spend $27 every six months for a new foil sucks, especially when Braun says it should last 18 months, but the time savings of electric vs manual kind of evens the score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase.  I am ecstatic about the price compared to comparable brands.  I am happy with the build quality.  I am happy with the battery life.  I am satisfied with the cut (even the annoying areas on my neck that never seem to be cut on the first or fifth swipe).  I am neutral on the cutting head&#x27;s life.  I dislike the cost of new heads at roughly $27.  The downsides are why I give the 4 star score instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Very poor shaving experience.... Lots of noise for nothing ...</li>
    <li> To buy at the best price and good use</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok but will never shave like a blade</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need to spend 200 bucks on a good electric shaver these days. I was very... surprised at the quality since I had not bought one for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is in the 60 dollar range and is worth every penny a bargain even and it so far (few months) has worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent 3 plus times as much on my last electric shaver 10 years ago, so it did last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them to shave the areas of my face that cut or have rashes over and over... and then lightly shave the rest of my face with the electric shaver. The newer swivel plastic razors in the bags, I use next lightly and the whole thing keeps my face looking clean quickly without cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course for a moderately close shave, you can use the shaver often but I found that about every 4 days on the neck and so forth, a razor was still needed.But they are always good to quickly run out the door if you are not in your rough look phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All electric shavers require a quick rinse of the face after to take off the fine dusting of cut hairs... . If you have a raw place that cuts easily and don&#x27;t like electric shavers generally... I suggest that you consider shaving with this electric shaver first in those spots and don&#x27;t touch that spot with a razor ever again, then use the good quality plastic razor for the rest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many shavers over the years, and this is the best one I remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously had another Braun, and it worked well. Except it seemed to shave too close and I sometimes got ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 340s hasn&#x27;t caused the same problem. And it shaves whiskers off with no problem,  even when I wait a couple days to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> In use for one week. Doing a nice job so far while using  it dry. Have not tried a wet shave yet. My 2-day growth required a little more repetitive work in order to get a close shave but using it everyday is much better. I would recommend for those who don&#x27;t care for a rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> I only buy a new shaver when necessary and have used other Braun shavers as well as other brands. After reading the comments submitted by other buyers, decided to try this one. Have not used it in the shower yet, but it is providing a great dry shave. It&#x27;s a convenient shaver to hold and fits your hand well.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a blade for 50 years.  A medical condition required me to make the switch.  After considerable research, I picked the 340S.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I shave in the shower, with regular soap (Ivory, it suds up well) for lubrication.  It shaves 99% as close as a blade.  Still a few awkward-angle spots that are hard to get completely, but that was true with a blade too.  No cuts, no irritation, same or less time.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with it so far (3 months).  Every two weeks, I turn it on and toss it on the bed until it runs down fully, then recharge it.  It made three weeks once, but I think it might have been slowing down a bit.  I am as picky and critical person as you can find (a perfectionist software designer) and I have to say, this product is really well designed and constructed.  I was concerned about the few critical reviews here (I checked other sources too -- overwhelmingly positive reviews everywhere, but always a few negative) but my experience has been totally positive.  If you get a bad one, send it back for another.</li>
    <li> First electric razor I&#x27;ve used in over 30 years and I may never go back.It works great  wet or dry.</li>
    <li> My purpose is not served as I expected it to be powerful in cutting the hair but turn out to be a failure.</li>
    <li> I always found Braun&#x27;s shavers to be top notch...a little over designed maybe but typical German. I think this model had some Chinese design! The trimmer on my unit fell off when I opened the package. The problem is that the entire cutter assemble is help by two 1mm plastic studs with the heads melted to act as rivets.  This looks like it is done with a soldering iron!!! Poor design, weak, and just so unBraun-like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side it shaves like Braun, works great in the shower, and the intergrated single piece head cost $20 to replace. My experience in the shower is shavers fall on the hard floor and usually the head breaks somewhere. In this case the cost is 50% of Panasonic and this shaves better. The shave is clean but the grow back seems to have a coarser feel...possibly cutter design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is first week review. Two stars off for the trimmer design and getting one in perfect packaging that was broken!!!</li>
    <li> Update 2: Six months after buying it, the longhair trimmer fell off. Because it was within warranty, their service center was good about repairing it and sending it back to me within two weeks. Was just a hassle I didn&#x27;t expect to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1: They have fixed their description on their website and removed the erroneous &#x27;works corded&#x27; copy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I just received it, and despite what both Braun&#x27;s website and the product&#x27;s description on Amazon say, this shaver does not function while corded. The whole reason I went with this shaver is because batteries always die before motors do, which is why you want a shaver you can use while it&#x27;s plugged into the wall, once that happens.  I have not used the shaver yet, but until Braun updates its descriptions to remove this misleadingly nonexistant feature, it earns a one-star.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor...I researched electric razors for several weeks and decided on this one after reading the reviews. I had a phillips norelco and it took forever to shave and left my skin irritated every time. This razor cut perfectly and my skin has not been irritated.</li>
    <li> Not a bad electric shaver and it&#x27;s a nice that it can be used wet. The problem I have with this shaver is whilst it copes easily with my facial hair it struggles around my neck area. I find myself trying to go over the same areas to remove the hairs and this can irritate my skin. However, I&#x27;ve yet to find an electric shaver that doesn&#x27;t struggle on my neck area.</li>
    <li> Had a Braun received in Dec. 2000 which was finally not taking/holding a charge well. That was commendable, in that they recommend replacing in 6 yrs. The new 340S-4 seems to shave a little closer, especially if you take care to not put undue pressure on your skin, because the springs which push against the cutting blades seem to have low tension and probably wouldn&#x27;t work as well if you put lots of pressure on them. Unlike my old one, you can wash this one clean after use, and you can also wet shave with it, though I haven&#x27;t yet. Didn&#x27;t do extensive research on different models, but it seems a major difference from 380-S is the washing system, maybe a more intricate charging display. Those items aren&#x27;t worth a whole lot more to me, especially since the 340-S can be rinsed under a faucet, and I simply rinse the head assembly in rubbing alcohol in a small plastic cup.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new shaver.  He&#x27;s owned a Braun before, but this one shaves closer and leaves his skin smooth.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cut very well...does not shVE CLEAN</li>
    <li> maybe somebody is not going to get rush of shaving,  on the face but I did, it&#x27;s good thing but for me useles.</li>
    <li> This does the job.  I love it!  It doesn&#x27;t make much sound when I am shaving my clients but it is doing job so well.  I am happy about my purchase!</li>
    <li> works well as described. great</li>
    <li> Absolutely ridiculous. You must unplug the shaver from the wall every time you use it. And if the battery runs down for any reason, you can&#x27;t use it until you recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty pathetic. My 10-year old Braun can be used just fine while plugged in.</li>
    <li> just what I needed. and great price</li>
    <li> well this is my first electric shaver I decided to buy it because my brother has a norelco and well this isn´t what I expected at all from a braun product, Im really disappointed, it keeps missing some neck stubble, leaving scattered whiskers to grow longer and longer., also I have to take a long time to shave because I have to pass it, several times on the same place to get shave.</li>
    <li> It works great for an electric razor when you need it.  I mainly shave with a razor</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with an electric razor. I have been shaving for 40 years. I agree with other reviewers who said a good shave depends on your particular face. This razor and my face were not meant for each other.</li>
    <li> bought as a Christmas gift.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am a white male with course black hair, I use this razor on my face and head twice daily. I must say, this is by far the best electric razor I have ever used. The shave 8s very close, almost as close as a traditional razor my girlfriend actually can&#x27;t tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery life is AMAZING!!! On a full charge it lasts up to 11 days, and that&#x27;s shaving my head and face twice a day! Pretty impressive. It charges quickly, full charge in less than an hour when battery is fully drained.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans easily, the foil comes off and hair washes off with ease.&lt;br /&gt;There are no hair particles left on my face or head, which I love, the foil traps them all, so I don&#x27;t have to shower afterwards as I typically do a dry shave, and there is very little irritation, 8 don&#x27;t even have to use afterhsave.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the plastic travel cover, it is ok, but seems like it could fall off if it was bouncing around in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Close shave&lt;br /&gt;-Cleans easily&lt;br /&gt;-Great battery life&lt;br /&gt;-Minimal irritation after shaving&lt;br /&gt;-Quickly charges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Flimsy travel cover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, awesome razor, I love it and plan to use it for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver is a beautiful product and performs very well.</li>
    <li> This product is a crap.. do not catches the hair as a shaver should.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok it&#x27;s supposed to be a really good shaver but I don&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t that great for me and it&#x27;s my first electric shaver</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my son.  He loves it ans wished he bought this a long time ago.  Gets a great, smooth shave.  Very happy with it and recommends it.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun Series 1 with a single foil which I thought was great, I was wrong, this 2-foil and middle trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve had.  It does quick work of even 4-day old stubble.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have never owned an electric shaver until this one.  I am aware an electric can never get as close as a blade.  However, I only wanted to knock off the stubble every other day.  For what I wanted, this works great.  Battery life is fantastic.  Must have used 15 times before recharging.  Very Happy.</li>
    <li> Good quality product and good purchase experience.</li>
    <li> Finally got a electric shaver that I can&#x27;t wait to use... Again and again, I LOVE IT 😛😛😛</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.  No need to speend $100 to $200 for later model.</li>
    <li> Great razor to replace my last Braun razor.  LONG battery life (2 weeks and no sign of fading).  Nice, close, comfortable, fast shave.  I didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my old razor was - this one really hums through the job. Lightweight, easy to hold.  Simple to clean with a quick water rinse.  Everything I expected and more, would recommend this to any burly lumberjack.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have ever owned.  I&#x27;ve only had it a week or so, so if it breaks tomorrow I&#x27;ll revise this review.  But so far so good!</li>
    <li> I admit I bought this shaver to shave my legs.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous ladies electric shavers and they are all horrible! The ladies shavers are extremely loud, only hold a charge for one or two shaves, and require multiple passes over the same area making shaving my legs way too time consuming.  Also, look in stores.  There are usually only one or two ladies shavers to choose from if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I would invest in a good mens shaver and after reading reviews chose this one.  Wow. It&#x27;s amazing how much better it is than any electric shaver I have ever used.  It&#x27;s really quiet and I was able to shave my legs every day for a week on one charge! (By the way it only takes an hour to fully recharge)  It&#x27;s a smooth shave and I love the battery indicator light on the front.  The head pivots slightly so shaving around my ankles and knees is easy and effective.  The only drawback is the teasing I get from my husband for using a mens shaver.  Oh well, the results are well worth it!</li>
    <li> For years I have wanted to try a Braun and never did - just kept buying the same old rotary shaver.  Finally, after buying the same type shaver once again a little over a year ago (and after debating between it and the Braun) and getting continual mediocre shaves, I bought the Braun 3Series.  Best decision I could make.  An incredibly close shave, so close that the next morning it still feels better than what I was getting from my almost new old shaver (with now a new shaving head).  It takes a few days for your skin to adjust it and it is well it.</li>
    <li> The plug isn&#x27;t confirm with The European! But it&#x27;s a fine reasor</li>
    <li> great as a gift, great quality, durable and shaves smooth, shipped quick, I highly  do recommend purchase of this item</li>
    <li> good clean shave when you get used to it as opposed to a rotary; holds charge well and is powerful</li>
    <li> I replaced a Braun razor I had for 10 years with this one.  My original one was over $200 so I was skeptical about the performance of this one but it&#x27;s been as good as my other Braun.  I&#x27;ve only used it in dry mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel case and my old one doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> I have always had a issue with rashes, from blade shaving, and every electric I have ever tried pulled out the hairs painfully more that cut them. But I took a chance on this about three weeks ago, and I love it! No more rashes, no more painful shaves, Just make sure to keep up on the oiling and cleaning and it works incredibly! The charge lasts for a great amount of time, I keep it in my car and shave on my way to work, and I only have to charge it over the weekend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Grt! This came on time all good. Nothing else to say but ok. Nothing wrong and came on time. Grt.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Braun after using the Phillips Norelco for several years. (Replacement heads for the Norelco were never quite satisfactory). I have use the Braun now for some months now, and this is what I have learned.  1. The Braun shaves much closer, and almost as close as a Gillette blade. 2. It takes almost twice as long to shave with the Braun versus the Norelco, because you have to go over the same places multiple times . 3. If I wait three of more days between shaving, the Braun razor sometimes pulls the hairs, rather than cuts. (Yes I do use the supplied lubricant, as well as William Pre-save). 4. The sideburn trimmers shave about the same, however the Norelco is a bit easier to use around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My disappoint with the Braun is not at the level to return the product to Amazon (even though I know they would accept the return) but enough to warrant a switch back to Norelco.</li>
    <li> i just received it today,and i loved it its an amazing shaver and trimmer,good looking and totally worth it. its the best shaver i&#x27;ve ever had. and amazon&#x27;s delivery was accurate.nice experience.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the quality shave provided by this shaver.  It provides a close shave in dry mode, and is even closer when I use shaving gel for a wet shave.  It also has a very strong motor, and yet provides about 5 days of shaves on a single 1 hour charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like wet-dry shavers and have used Panasonics for over twenty years. Yet I&#x27;ve found that this Braun requires less shave time than the last Panasonic model I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, this shaver provides a very close shave, is well made, sports very affordable price and comes from a primo manufacturer that you can trust.  That makes this shaver an EXCEPTIONAL VALUE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t discover this model about two years ago.</li>
    <li> I shave my face and head.  I used to use different brand foil shaver, then rotary, and now to this foil shaver and don&#x27;t regret it.  Gets as close as a blade more than any electric shaver I have tried.  After 3 weeks of research this was worth the price, without all the expensive bells and whistles that are not necessary in the higher models.  Beats any closeness I ever got with any other razor on my face and head, and I have steel wool for hair yet it mows right through it.  No irritation at all.  Works great in shower and on dry just use a pre-shave lotion or shave powder and results will amaze you.</li>
    <li> I have had the Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver for about a month.  I use it dry during the week.  I gives me a smooth shave and no burn.  On the week end I use it with shaving cream for a smooth effect.  I would recommend this razon to anyone looking for a great wet or dry shave.</li>
    <li> it is good，Easy to use。Liked  I&#x27;ve only been using this new Braun shaver for two months, but it has performed very nicely so far. I get a comfortable close shave in less than five minutes.</li>
    <li> Had remmington electric razors for years, saw add for the braun and thought I would try I use every day and believe I get A longer life from the charge than they say, I also get a closer shave from the braun than I ever did  from any other brand razor, I am very pleased with the performence from this razor</li>
    <li> This works OK for my light growth, which needs shaving only once per week.  Even so, on some areas, the Braun has made my skin red from the number of passes it&#x27;s taken to get down to smooth.  I would guess that it would not work better on a hairy guy, but that&#x27;s speculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like is the trimming function, which I use to pare down my beard and mustache.  It works much better than my 30-year old model, but probably they&#x27;re all better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy.  Functions are easy.  It&#x27;s fine for me.  I give it three stars because of having at times to roll over an area several times and because I can&#x27;t imagine that it&#x27;s a top performer on a tough beard.</li>
    <li> It works great! Cuts clean and close</li>
    <li> loving it&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for a while now and been working as good as the first day, very comfortable and shaves well</li>
    <li> Good,bi feilipu hao ji tiao jie.</li>
    <li> Always wanted an electric shaver that&#x27;s waterproof so you could use shaving cream. This one may not be Braun&#x27;s top of the line, but still a good solid shaver. Loved it since I got it for my birthday.</li>
    <li> it works fine, but, you need to pull skin tight to get&lt;br /&gt;close shave on one pass, otherwise, you need several&lt;br /&gt;passes to get close shave</li>
    <li> It was a cheaper option, so I guess we got what we paid for.  Wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work, as I would have to use it on my husband who has Alzheimer&#x27;s.  It turned out to work pretty well, although the top part fell off and came all apart and I had to have someone else put it back together...maybe I cleaned it too vigorously!!!!  Anyway, as far as an inexpensive (compared to others) model, I guess it suits the purpose.</li>
    <li> Not as close a razor, but good enough. Does good dry or wet. The charge is good. I also like the design of the trimmer pop-up (whatever you call it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This one is not very good product. I like the Panasonic much better. But the Panasonic has big noise. That&#x27;s why I return my Panasonic one and buy this one. It was bad decision. The shaving is not very comfortable at all.</li>
    <li> I love using a double edge safety razor and my shaving brush/soap. But some morning i need to be out the door quickly AND need to look presentable. Plus this thing is great for traveling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the Braun shines. If you only have less than 3 days growth (i have straight, thick, dark hair) than this thing will do just fine. Anything more and you&#x27;ll start feeling those annoying tugs at your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a snap to clean and i don&#x27;t think you need to waste your time with the base station nonsense. Yeah, they are nice but really its just another money sink. Those cartridges are ridiculously priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, its a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver at a big box store.  I was planning to purchase the same brand shaver I&#x27;ve had for several years, but none were available.  I saw the Braun wet/dry at a fairly good price (it came with a few extra items in the &amp;#34;package&amp;#34; deal). Had I not needed it so desperately, I would&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon and waited for delivery.  But the old shavers I had were really tearing up my face.  The cost of replacement cutters are almost as much as a new shaver!  (In the past, I&#x27;ve opted to replace cutters rather than purchase a new shaver. But having replaced cutters several times, it was time to buy a new shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my skin has changed or maybe the replacement cutters simply are not manufactured at the same high quality as they are on new shavers.  Whatever the reason, skin irritation told me it was time to make a change.  And even with new blades, my old shaver was uncharacteristically leaving hairs uncut.  I&#x27;d shave in the morning and not 30 minutes after being in the office,  inadvertently brush my face and find a long uncut hair here and there.  Even after experiencing this, I was still going to go with the same brand shaver...until I saw the Braun.  The wet/dry system appealed to me.  I was thinking that shaving gel would add protection for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this shaver with a Gillette shaving gel.  Bottom line, the shave is clean, close and comfortable.  No more stray hairs left behind.  Plus, clean-up  is easy.  Uncap the foil head, rinse it under hot water, rinse the top of the shaver&#x27;s main body, re-cap foil head, turn it on to shake out excess water, done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy that I purchased this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 12/04/15.  Since purchasing on February 21, 2015, the shaver has performed reliably each and every morning. (Initially, I used it as a wet shaver.  But, lately, I&#x27;ve used it  as a dry shaver.  Both ways give me a clean, comfortable shave.)  This morning, however, the cutting blade assembly  on the  pop-up  trimmer broke off.  All I did was extend it to engage the cutter and it fell off.  It appears that the blade assembly is held in place by a sonic weld of two plastic rivets.  Once those two rivets give out, the assembly just breaks off.  Perhaps a bit of superglue will mend it.  But really, I&#x27;ve never had any part on any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned (Norelco, Remington, or Panasonic) break.  I have to re-rate this shaver from five stars to four stars.  It still gives me a great shave, but  the pop-up trimmer should not break off in less than a year.mer broke off.  All I did was extend it to engage the cutter and it fell off.

    <li> I gave this as a gift and I think he likes it. Shaves close, not too noisy and cleans easily.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and functionality of this shaver. Having used only Panasonic wet-dry shavers before, I was not sure what to expect. This shaver is excellent so far and it it lasts longer than the Panasonic ones I will continue to buy these from now on.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. He also has the same one in England and they work very well. With some razors he gets a rash but not with this one.</li>
    <li> Braun shavers give the best shave that I&#x27;ve felt so far! Takes a bit long to shave the longer hairs but can&#x27;t argue with the results.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great razor. Shaves close and holds a charge. Better than most razors costing much more.</li>
    <li> Very compotable thing!</li>
    <li> Very good I like the fact it even works with my face wet</li>
    <li> Works well on face but not very well on neck.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast. Well packaged .  My dad my dad was happy. He had a older model that  finally  died. This worked out well.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Smooth &amp; clean wet or dry!</li>
    <li> Works great! I still have to touch up with a razor a little but that&#x27;s not the Braun&#x27;s fault. It&#x27;s difficult for anything to get a perfect shave all by itself. I definitely have way less razor burn and red bumps!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older model and it does a much better job.  Good battery life and it comes with a stand which is nice. Keeps me from buying expensive blades all the time.</li>
    <li> This electric razor has a good, solid feel.  It gives a close dry shave and the battery charge lasts for several days. It&#x27;s performance matches that of a more expensive Panasonic razor which I have but cost significantly less.  I rate it as a good buy.</li>
    <li> not impressed by this shaver strikes me as a, you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a razor. It works wet or dry. It has a trimmer. That&#x27;s about it. Nothing really fancy here. Doesn&#x27;t handle facial hair that goes multiple directions well nor can it handle very long stubble. Bought this hoping to help reduce problems with razor bumps but this hasn&#x27;t alleviated them.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide a good shave.</li>
    <li> In 40 years I never had an electric shave and luckily I only have to shave once a week (due slow and blond hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of the torture of the blades and decided to try a mid-priced discounted item like this one and I am not sure what to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works fine on top, but it just doesn&#x27;t work very well on my neck. I tried dry, wet, wet and cream and it just &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t cut it&amp;#34; (pun intended). I tried every angle possible with so many repetitions that causes more skin-stress than a Gillette triple blade would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just have a weird neck hair (it actually grows kind of sideways) because the shave works great on my face, even under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to think, but I end up re-touching with a blade after shaving, kind of beating the purpose of having an electric shave...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said: if shaves actually shave your face, then this could be a 5-star item, I give it 2 stars because of the nice finish and design and for working on my face portion of my head:) ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give it a couple more tries, maybe a different cream or foam would help....  else I will use it as a pricey trimmer only ...</li>
    <li> I have now used the Braun razor for two months. I would rate it as excellent. It holds a charge for a long time. I keep looking at the dial to see if a charge is needed and it keeps showing &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;. Does good job on my morning shaves. Has selection for sharp cutting on sideburns.Can not ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> Great overall but for some reason just won&#x27;t seem to shave my neck properly so I had to return it. Otherwise, it is amazing. Such a shame . . .</li>
    <li> Average at best. I bought it because my 15 year old Braun died and I assumed it would be as good.</li>
    <li> nice，but have little noise when using it</li>
    <li> Good  item,I like it.</li>
    <li> Works well, reasonable price</li>
    <li> My husband was very pleased to receive this shaver and likes it better all the time</li>
    <li> in general , this is a good shaver to use , good-looking with powerful battery .&lt;br /&gt;but charging accessory seems as low-class plastic and surface transparent panel is easy to get scratches . except packing , other are fine .</li>
    <li> I got this as I wanted a shaver for touch ups and daily upkeep. I had tried the ones with the round blades and found them to be lacking. So I figured for the price I would try this one with the foils esp since I read some great reviews on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the best pro is it&#x27;s price. For a good daily shaver, this is great price. The head comes off easily and can be cleaned with ease. It is also water resistant so it can be used in the shower or with a shaving gel. I found it to give a fairly close shave and not irritate the skin. It comes with a nice charging stand, sample size oil for the blades, a cover for the blades, and a brush for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some of the expensive self cleaning models in the past and tbh this does all they did for me. The one exception is I have to clean it, which is rather easily done imo. So if you don&#x27;t mind the extra min spent on upkeep of it, then def go this route and save your money for much more fun things :)</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor! I bought it for him as an anniversary present, he is currently stationed overseas and loves being able to use it either wet or dry even in the days where he has to shave multiple times there is no irritation.</li>
    <li> For the price it was a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I kinda wish I had gone with the Norelco instead. I&#x27;ve used Norelco in the past and had decent results but this Braun doesn&#x27;t come close to the Norelco level. I&#x27;ve used it both dry and with shaving creme and the cut is horrendous. Granted I&#x27;ve come from several years of using actual razor blades but I didn&#x27;t think an electric shaver would be this poor of a shave. I end up having to go over areas multiple times and its a good 5 min shave whereas the razor was maybe 2 mins at the most, not to mention irritating the heck out of my neck area...surprised I&#x27;ve not had someone ask &#x27;what did you do to your neck&#x27;. Yeah an actual razor will always have a closer shave, but this shave is ridiculous. For paying $75 for this thing I&#x27;d have never expected this poor of a shaving experience....</li>
    <li> shaves well and is very quiet.</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard to shave and of all the brands and styles I have tried, this works the best.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work that well for me. I never get what I think is a clean shave and often follow it with a razor. I actually got it during a time I couldn&#x27;t risk cutting myself, but, now that that seems over, I don&#x27;t know if I will use it very often. I will say, to be totally fair, I have yet to use an electric razor that I felt I got a really good shave with.</li>
    <li> So I have not had an electric shaver for nearly twenty years, and I was talked into this one.  Could not be more pleased with it!  The charge lasts several days, though actually I have not ever run out of charge.  I just pop it back on every 4 or 5 days and it charges in 10 minutes or so.  Great close shave which is nearly as close as a blade.  I don&#x27;t think electric shavers will every be as close as a blade, but this one gets pretty darn close and so far I love it.  Comfortable, easy to hold, quiet, and the head blades move up and down if you push on them so it is always comfy against your face.</li>
    <li> very bad not worth the money does not cut</li>
    <li> Shaves well, seems to get the little hairs that lay flat better than my old Remington, largely because of the middle cutter.  Does nto shave as close as a 3 blade conventional razor which I still prefer for a really close shave but sure is easier!  If it isnt close enough to last an entire day (for me it is) just redo, its quick.  Washable feature is great, by the way.  It seems to hold a charge ok too.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price</li>
    <li> It is good but it makes my skin red and I feel like allergic to it. Bit I think it is my skin problem</li>
    <li> First time writing a review. I got to say the product is disappointing. The outer package is intact, but the inner box is already opened. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s used or not. Replacement would be too much trouble for we foreigners, so I just keep it.</li>
    <li> I lover my new shaver i got me and my wife one we both love it for 2rozers was like 100.00 for both s.h was free it got to us real fast thay change up fast thay have a lite on front of it tell u win to chage win its done win u take your razor out of the box there will also be long box that will have your changing stand dc cord info book blade protected cap brush and blade remineder chang the blades ever 18mo. Thank u</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this electric shaver for a few weeks now and it works great.  I had seen this series priced elsewhere much higher.  It is great to use to do a full shave or a quick clean-up.  Love the additional clean line tool.  Totally satisfied with this purchase!  My wife is much happier that I can use this shaver to keep a more clean shaving look.</li>
    <li> The foil head broke after two months, just days after I could return it.  Now I&#x27;m supposed to pay 22.00 for a new one?  I won&#x27;t waste any more money. Infuriating.</li>
    <li> I get the worse shave from this razor I have had ever had. My old razor with dull blades does a much better job. The only reason I even give one star is because Amazon requires it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Father-in-Law for Christmas and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and the shave is very close and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> A Great piece of kit.  Lightweight and easy to use, does a good job and does it well.</li>
    <li> I fine it works best with a shaving cream. Good product</li>
    <li> I have owned several Panasonic and Braun shavers as I prefer foils to rotary.&lt;br /&gt;I was relatively happy with my most recent Panasonic but the battery just gave up with the unit in good condition, very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I have only had the Braun for just over a week but so far:&lt;br /&gt;1. It has cut beard better and quicker than the Panasonic&lt;br /&gt;2. The battery is still on the original charge and I have a tough beard so this is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Will try and update this review after a few more weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 20th&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so I have owned this shaver for just over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life continues to be incredibly impressive and FAR superior to my previous shaver (Panasonic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use my shave time has increased just a little, presumably because the blades are not quite as sharp as out of the box, but still getting a very good, quick and close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like the movable heads on other (more expensive) models, I have to say that I am still very pleased with this Braun and its rigid head, the three foil set-up works well and for the money I think it is exceptional value.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> good quality, reliable. Made in China. pretty good deal. worthy of buying. I strongly recommend this series as its cheaper than Series 7.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this razor if you have thick hair. This shaver doesnt shave close, and will cut up your skin in the process. After 2 weeks of trying to adjust to it, I got more razor bumps than I had before. Even when using it with shaving cream in the shower, there were still patches of hair left on my face. For dry shaving, use a good pair of clippers which cost about the same as this shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband is enjoying his shaver.  It gives a smooth shave, and now he doesn&#x27;t have to suffer with razor bumps.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an older Braun. It works great and I will stay with Braun.</li>
    <li> Took forever to be delivered.  Works OK, but not as good as my 1776 Series Braun.</li>
    <li> Whether wet or dry, it takes a helluva long time to shave with this razor -- but maybe that&#x27;s the deal with all electric razors. It&#x27;s OK for a touch-up, or in case of emergency, like a really long day at work, but a regular morning shave takes like four times as long as with a non-electric razor, which stinks because the non-electric razors really irritate my face.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my legs,  the edger will cut u so be careful.  And if u try it on longer hair (tested it on my husband&#x27;s legs) it won&#x27;t grab it.  Works best on shorter hair</li>
    <li> great item works as described fast shipping</li>
    <li> I got the razor earlier this week and it gives a great shave, but I have not had it long enough to really see if it really lives up to all its claims. I would be willing to write another review later.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I had the 3 series before, just not the -4 model. This is one of the few electrics i can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate or cut my face, even while applying pressure. I was going to buy replacement blades for my old model but the cost was half as much as the new shaver so i just bought the shaver again.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s second Braun 3.  He is extremely pleased with it and likes the wet/dry&lt;br /&gt;feature. He has a heavy beard and for a real close shave will follow up with a razor.</li>
    <li> Only issue I&#x27;ve found is you have to use very regularly.  If you miss a day or two, it tends to have trouble cutting longer hairs, especially at the neck.</li>
    <li> feels high quality tool &amp;#62;</li>
    <li> shaves much closer and faster than my 3 headed norelco and dont have to use a circular motion on my face like norelco recommends.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Good product. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this planning to replace my mk3, but I ended up preferring my mk3. I do use this for travel and to give my face the occasional break, but it defiantly is not as close as a razor and takes at least twice as long to shave. It is super easy to clean out and the battery seems to rival a nokia phone, so it is a fantastic travel razor...just don&#x27;t lose the plug as it will cost you the price of the razor. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> a really great shaver for the money.  both my husband and I use it.  we both love the ease of use and the close shave</li>
    <li> Very good razor for a decent price. I bought this just to use for Movember it it worked like a charm. Plus its washable which is an excellent addition.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son.  He told me that he gets very close and very smooth shaves with it but no nicks and no ingrown hairs.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;really disappointed in this product. i have always liked Braun shavers, but this one just is crap. it does not cut well, can shave faster with a blade[ 1/2 the time] you have to use it wet, or in the shower to get any decent results. my little braun travel shaver does a better job, and quicker.my old norelco for less than half the price is a better shaver. if i hadn&#x27;t waited so long , i would have returned it.</li>
    <li> If you are tired of looking around at shavers and you just want something easy, go with this one. I have had ingrown hairs all my life, this product works. Best bang for your buck around. Foil is so much better than rotary, I&#x27;ve tried it all. Sensitive skin, go with foil.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness... This is the greatest shaver ever. This is the only thing strong enough to cut Chuck Norris&#x27; beard and the only thing Godly enough to shave Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to anyone wanting to ditch the Mach 3. My wife even uses it on her legs and loves it.</li>
    <li> Have used this razor several times now.  Over the past 20 years I have used every major brand of electric razor.  The first brand I tried was Braun.  They were great for awhile, but at some point the quality dropped and the price jumped, so I tried other brands with mixed satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have to say, this razor is the best electric razor I have ever used.  It is by far the quietest and most comfortable electric razor I have ever used. The comfort may be due to it not cutting as closely as other razors, I&#x27;m not sure.  I seem to regain my \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; more quickly than I did with the Remington I just retired.  Even so, it is so nice to use an electric razor that does not irritate my skin that I don&#x27;t mind if the shave is slightly less close.  I don&#x27;t dread my next shave now. For what it&#x27;s worth, I do not put anything on my face before I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only question yet to be answered about this razor is how long will the blade and foil hold up before they need replacement, or how long will the \\&quot;comfort\\&quot; level hold up (which I expect will diminish as the blade and foil wear).  For now, I give this razor five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to mention, I&#x27;m finding the battery on this razor holds it charge longer than any razor I&#x27;ve owned before.  I have been careful to follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions on the initial charge and recharge of the battery.</li>
    <li> This little Braun 3 series is a decent shaver, esp. when you factor in the cost.  The fit of the components is very tight &amp; uniform.  Not too light, but not to heavy.  A slightly smaller shaving footprint might help improve shaving in tight areas (ie: sharp angular jaw lines) but overall does a great job.  I feel that my older Braun 8595 shaver is slightly superior in terms of shaving closer.  However, that being said the versatility of being able to shave with the Braun 3 dry or wet is a great blessing.  Not having to wait after you get out of the shower to shave saves me a boat load of time.  While some people prefer to shave before their shower, I prefer after since I use a pre-scrub cleaner to help get a closer, smoother shave with my very coarse hair.  Those pre-electric shaving balms do help, but not always (esp. humid weather).  Please note, I&#x27;ve only had this unit for a week and have only used it in the shower (w/ shaving gel) twice, but both times the results were surprisingly good.  Also, it felt very weird using an electric shaver in the shower.  A solid 4 out of 5 stars (due in part to its &#x27;newness&#x27; and also the fact that my older 5 year old 8595 shaver did a slightly better job).</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my Braun 340S Shaver . I liked my old Braun shaver but the new one shaves closer and is quiter . It will give me several shaves on a single charge and the trimmer works well . My only complaint is that it does not come with a case . My previous shaver had a case that was very handy when traveling . You could just drop it in the suitcase and the shaver was protected . If it only had a case I would have given it a five star rateing .</li>
    <li> It works very well on a very tough beard. I have always had problems with electric shavers getting a close enough shave. This does an amazing job.</li>
    <li> Prior to this purchase i&#x27;ve used a Norelco rotary shaver as a backup, but i like the Braun 340-s much better. It&#x27;s easy to use, cleans up well &amp; shaves a better line along the edge of my beard, I still use a blade for the most part, but when i&#x27;m in a hurry &amp; need a quick trim i use the Braun. It&#x27;s actually quieter than my old Norelco &amp; the charge lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The top part comes off sometimes and it does not shave as i expected</li>
    <li> I was previously using a Remington screen shaver, was about half the cost fo this one, had 5 or 6 of them over the last 10 years as little things would fail of the battery would stop charging.  I like this Braun much more.  It is much easier to use, feels more solid in the had, much faster to shave with, easy to clean, smartly designed to have a good feeal and be the right size in the hand avoid any points of failure, battery life is 2-3 weeks shaving every other day.  It does not shave as close as my previous Remmington shaver, but it is much faster and close enough for me.  It also creates less irritation of the skin since it isn&#x27;t getting as close.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with the braun  3 series 340s-4 wet&amp;dry Shaver,&lt;br /&gt;PROS lightweight ,  non slip grip,  easy to reach power switch ,easy to reach side trimmer , lots of power ,&lt;br /&gt;noise level within reasonable limits.&lt;br /&gt;CONS  foil shave head $18.00,no battery level indicator ,cannot operate while plugged in for charging .&lt;br /&gt;OK i have this Braun 3 series 340 shaver and I like just about everything it has to offer . although i have tried the older&lt;br /&gt;model wet shaving &amp; i could not shave like that simply for the fact the razor kept getting clogged up so i will not give&lt;br /&gt;a wet shave review on this model OK.&lt;br /&gt;OK as for a dry shave this little razor is great even if you have a full beard .i had a full beard when i got my razor from&lt;br /&gt;amazon &amp; my beard gets really thick &amp; clumpy right around my chin so what i did to save were and tare on the foil head i used&lt;br /&gt;the side trimmer and my beard simply melted away. SO guys if you are in the market for clean smooth shave give this razor a try&lt;br /&gt;makes a great gift too  PS FOR this razor to work great i start with a little pressure on my face whiskers are about 1/8 of an inch&lt;br /&gt;&amp; work my way downward along my cheeks and i get a perfect shave with a minimal of 3 passes&lt;br /&gt;OK  i HOPE this review finds you well.  THANKS.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband.  He really likes it.  Says it shaves close but never pulls at or is rough on his skin.</li>
    <li> Best shaver yet.  I am a electric shaver guy and this one works amazingly well.  Recommend this to every fave you know</li>
    <li> Product works, just as it was intended.</li>
    <li> This will be my second time purchasing this Razor. I had my original one with original blades for 3 years until i have to buy a new one. Having thick facial hair its always hard to find razor that works. I tried the norelco 3 rotary blade style and it hasnt even lasted me 5 month and the blades are dull and irritate my skin. Highly recommended especially for the price you can buy it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Piece of CRAP DON&#x27;T BUY IT. Couldn&#x27;t even remove one day&#x27;s stubble.</li>
    <li> Works great - charges fast. Easy to use. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Its a braun!  I have had other shavers, but simply fell in love with the design and quality I have come to know as Braun.</li>
    <li> What a great razor.  I have shopped and bought other razors in the past and had no luck.  This razor is for me.  Gets the tough to get neck hair and what a close shave it leaves.  Perfect buy for me.</li>
    <li> Great no more razors.  Works wet or dry. I dod get a 5 o clock shadow earlier than normal. Done</li>
    <li> I thought I would have to use it several times I would get a good shave but it worked very well the first time.It also works well on a two day old beard.</li>
    <li> The product seems fairly reliable, although the shave is not as close as my $40.00 Remington shaver gave me. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last though (I&#x27;ve had it a couple of weeks). It gets rid of whiskers very quickly compared with my last shaver.</li>
    <li> Does all that it claims to do at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My first Braun razor was a graduation gift in about 1990. That razor was wonderful and has lead to a (so far) lifelong loyalty to Braun razors. However, that first razor with its single foil has never been equaled in subsequent razors (3 or 4). For some reason Braun thinks 2 foils works better. It doesn&#x27;t work out that way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this razor three stars -- docking two stars each for problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It works ... ok. Not great. Just acceptable. I can live with it and am used to going over an areas several times to get most of the whiskers. This one sill leaves some stubble no matter how many times I go over an area. But it&#x27;s ok with me for the most part.  (-1 star)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I would dock the razor 1.5 stars for this if I could and considered a 2 star reduction. This razor DOES NOT WORK WHEN IT IS PLUGGED IN. This is very, very inconvenient. It means you have to make sure it is charged in advance when you need to use it. Usually not a problem, but when you forget, it is a very serious flaw that is inexcusable. I assume it is somehow cheaper for Braun to produce it that way, but it is highly aggravating. I would not buy this razor again if I&#x27;d known this in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this razor, know this limitation when you buy it.</li>
    <li> best price and best band , i have used the last one of series 3 for more than two years (still that one usable if i change the blade, but i choose to get a new one), best brand in the market (i bought for amazon.com, their customer service is great and fast)</li>
    <li> Good razor, good price.</li>
    <li> does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
    <li> Initial reviews helped spur me to buy this electric shaver.  Bottom line, it is a pretty darn good shaver....however, I will add its limitations:&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect this shaver to hit those hard to hit hairs etc.  It is a great everyday shaver that hits those all out hairs for many shavers....but that is all.  Do not let two or three days go by and the use this shaver...if you expect to cut those long face hairs with this shaver, it will hurt.  Good everyday shaver with its limits.....must have another close shaver/clipper for those hard to shave or close hairs.  Overall though, a very good everyday shaver that is painless under such circumstances.</li>
    <li> The shaver so far performs well, the charger stand is not up to Braun standards.</li>
    <li> I have used razors all my life. I tried Norelco rotary shavers and they didn&#x27;t work on me. I bought this Braun because I&#x27;ve grown tired of paying through the nose for replacement blades. It&#x27;s really worked out well. It gets nice and close, although I do need to take a few passes on the more curved parts of my face. The trimmer&#x27;s very effective as well. I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Great shaver!  No complaints.  The battery lasts long, the blades are sharp.  I don&#x27;t see a reason to get the more expensive one, my husband has had a few and this is the one he likes the best so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shaved but still does not shave as close as a blade. I can&#x27;t find an electric that doesn&#x27;t leave long hairs but overall it&#x27;s well made and a good value. No complaints on quality.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Love it&lt;br /&gt;C</li>
    <li> Big noise but good. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I owned a Panasonic which I paid about 25 dollars more about 2 years ago, and it never really shaved my face very well and had to use a regular razor to clean up the area&#x27;s it missed. It also started to go out at about 18 months. I have a tough beard and I really searched for a good foil razor. I have to say I am glad I did because this Braun was the right choice. I don&#x27;t recommend spending money on more expensive  razors even the self cleaning one&#x27;s because your throwing money in the trash. I know some people have given this razor less of a rating and I respect that. I just want everyone to know I am tuff to please.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought for my father.</li>
    <li> Great shaver overall but will not shave my neck properly so I was forced to send it back. Definitely worth giving it a shot — it looks like other people had more success with it than I did.</li>
    <li> This product is a total disappointment. I did a lot of research prior to purchase and every where I looked, it said the 3 series braun is made in Germany.  That&#x27;s why I decided to buy braun.  I have been using norelco for decades and decided to switch from rotary to foil. The shaving blades are not of high quality. Precision in cutting is lacking. You get a rough beard growth the next day. What else would you expect from a cheap Chinese made product!  On the positive side, it&#x27;s light weight, quiet, and battery lasts long. The trimmer is the best feature of this shaver.</li>
    <li> Very nice goods!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this piece of crap is the mustache trimmer. And I did NOT pay $50+ dollars for a glorified mustache trimmer. This shaver barely gets rid of stubble, let alone the long hairs it boasts of being able to get rid of! I spent 30 minutes with this thing with NO RESULTS AT ALL. Running over the same spot multiple times doesn&#x27;t even help. NO HAIR AT ALL WAS REMOVED WITHOUT THE MUSTACHE TRIMMER. 0/10, would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband is very like</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for years. Love them. For the price, this one is excellent. Good close shave wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Well made.  Shaves very close and smooth.</li>
    <li> Long battery life. Much closer shave than the old 3 series shavers. Best electric shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  Well worth the small price.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I ever had.  My husband has one and so do I.  It works very well on legs and armpits.  The battery is excellent.  I&#x27;ve never got it wet because I believe the blades will wear out faster.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.Comfortable,close shave,no irritation.When use with shave gel , result is amazing.</li>
    <li> I switched to electric razors around 25 years ago because actual razors gave me razor burn and my face was always bleeding after shaving.  After a couple of initial electric razors I purchased the Braun 5775 Series razor about 15 years ago and I loved it.  I still use it to this day, but it is becoming increasingly hard to find replacement blades, so I thought it was about time for an upgrade.  I received the Braun 340-S as a birthday gift from my wife and the razor burn problems have come back in a huge fashion.  It takes off all the hair (which is why the two stars instead of one), but it leaves my face a virtual bloody mess with numerous nicks bleeding after every shave (wet or dry shave).  Amazon will not take the item back at this point and I don&#x27;t really have a problem with that.  Procter and Gamble does have a money back guarantee (60 Days only) if you are not satisfied with the product.  I am currently waiting for any results from P&amp;G.    I was really hoping this razor was an upgrade from the older Braun model, being able to use it in the shower and all, but I was really disappointed with the issues of actual razors occurring all over again.  I already knew this, but it just goes to show that newer is not always better.</li>
    <li> I find that this razor does not shave my beard it takes for ever and it always a stubbly when I&#x27;m finished also it leaves long pieces of hair under my neck and under my chin</li>
    <li> shaves fast and close, and is very quiet.  wish it would run while plugged in but it only runs off the charge</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! My husband says it&#x27;s the best shaver he&#x27;s ever owned!</li>
    <li> I loved the product. I will update this review once I use the product more often.</li>
    <li> i went to a barber and got my first straight razor shave. then i went home and felt my face and felt so many hairy prickles.&lt;br /&gt;used this shaver and smoothed out my face like a babies bottom. Straight razor shave was 25 to 30 bucks without a tip, this costs double that but will last a long time. i love it. doesnt burnt he skin, doesnt pull the hair, works as described. giddy up.</li>
    <li> I bought this recently on sale for an unbelievable price. Didn&#x27;t expect it to compete with my 2 Panasonic shavers but it does. It gives a close shave in a short time for my type of beard. I do shave everyday and shave after I shower. I would say that my expensive Panasonic might shave a fraction closer but i paid $250 for that one and the Braun 340 only cost me $39.95. I decided to try it because it cost about the same as replacing the foil and cutters for the Panasonic. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week but I&#x27;m certainly impressed so far. I shave dry and since I have very hard water I haven&#x27;t use the water to clean it but it is very easy to take the head off and tap it a few times over the sink to clean it. The rest can be brushed if needed.</li>
    <li> I love my new shaver and it works better than expected.  Would suggest it to anyone who is looking for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the razor and it works just fine.No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Roger</li>
    <li> Very good shaver but not as good as my original braun old-school corded shaver.  Oh well, it works, and the battery life is very good.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best razor made for $50 Bucks...  Love it!!  :)</li>
    <li> This razor gives a wonderful shave. The wet/dry shave feature is a real convenience. My husband loves it.  Even I can use it for my legs.  It is a bit loud, but that is a small price to pay for such a great shave.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Braun products for as many years as we&#x27;ve been married and he&#x27;s never disappointed with their products.  They last him a very long time too!</li>
    <li> Does everything you could ever dream a shaver/trimmer could do.  Very well &amp; thoughtfully designed.</li>
    <li> I have always been fond of Braun products and this one is no exception. I have no doubt it will last longer than the Philips it is replacing which died in less than a year. The shave with the Braun is much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a norelco in the past but this time I bought a BraunI&#x27;ve had issues with my neck not in shape close in the past but what this razor it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue</li>
    <li> I get a close shave for a reasonable price.  This is my third Braun shaver, and each one last years and years.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun that lasted many years and when it was time to retire it, I checked out a leading consumer magazine and opted for a Panasonic shaver.  Bad move.  After a year, I&#x27;m back to Braun.  I get a better shave, it&#x27;s quieter and holds a longer charge.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers say this takes too long to shave with.  I let my beard grow for two days and timed the shave time.  3 minutes 4 secs.  Being of Italian heritage, I would consider my facial hair avg. to heavy in growth an density.  Does it shave as close as a blade? No, it doesn&#x27;t.  But it&#x27;s darn close. I know if I went through the prep and cleanup required to use a blade, it would take a lot longer, and I&#x27;m stuck with being at my bathroom sink.  I can use this electric anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;As for the battery, a blue light is on during use.  It flashes when it is getting low. Can&#x27;t give an exact number of shaves per charge, but would guess 10- 15.  When the red light starts flashing,  it&#x27;s time for a recharge.  Do not run a lithium ion battery until lit stops functioning. It is bad for the battery.  One caveat, this shaver will not work with the ac cord  attached.  Probably a safety issue, since this shaver can be used in wet conditions, like a shower.  Can&#x27;t imagine anyone using an electrical cord in those conditions, but they do give out Darwin awards.  I&#x27;ve had this shaver about 10 months. So far So good.</li>
    <li> Finally found a razor after researching and searching forever and chose this one. Got it for a great deal on amazon. My wife was complaining about my constant scruff and a normal razor was cutting up my face. I had used a rotary shaver before, but wanted to try a foil one instead. It was a good decision except for the when I used it the first time dry, my face broke out with swollen red spots. It was awful. I then started using shaving cream with it and its made a world of difference. I haven&#x27;t had the red marks since. It doesn&#x27;t cut my neck hairs like I would like, but I get a great, close shave on my face. This is a great inexpensive razor. The battery life is good, which is still going strong for almost 3 weeks since I opened the box, and the razor works either wet or dry with easy cleaning. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The shave was not as close as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Worked great for one week.  Once the charge went dead (yes, I checked the outlet for power:  it was good) haven&#x27;t been able to charge it since.  Hopefully this is just a one-off lemon and the replacement will perform to Braun expectations.  I bought my last Braun back in 2001 and it still works, it&#x27;s just getting old.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s somewhat heavy.And the noises is too much. I donn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good.However,amazon is good.</li>
    <li> best stuff that I bought ever</li>
    <li> Perfect production! A little bigger but wonderful touch. I&#x27;d like to introduce this to others .</li>
    <li> My older Braun was 10 years old and the switch as getting iffy.  This new razor has performed very well and the technology advances over the years are significant.  I believe the technology and quality of Braun continues.</li>
    <li> Great value. Works in wet and dry as advertised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy. A closer shave than the razor, within minutes and that to with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye to razor, foam,brush,aftershave. Excellent product from braun.</li>
    <li> It works good not the best it does misss hair some times when shaving and it does tug on long hair if it&#x27;s not oiled up good . .</li>
    <li> Shaver received, I very love</li>
    <li> Ive used it 3 times, all times it worked great, although I much rather prefer using shaving cream with the electric razor, without the shaving cream the machine pulled some hairs, but overall very happy with it, I charged it over a week ago and it is still running, have not had to recharge as of yet. impressive battery life span.... If I have something negative to say about the machine is that it takes me a few times going over the same spot to get some of the trickier hair on my face to come off, but it leaves my face feeling surprisingly smooth.</li>
    <li> Not a real bad shaver, but you have to keep going over your face to get a close shave.  Like the idea of shower shaving.</li>
    <li> 很好用，很不错，亚马逊海淘直邮简直就是良心。</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. It worked fairly well for the first month, but now it is pretty much useless. I have had to go over the same spot on my face 5+ times to get a decent shave, and I had given up on my neck all together. I followed the cleaning and maintenance instructions as well. I spent $50 on this, and it was definitely a waste. I&#x27;ve gone back to regular blades even though they cause redness, I need to be clean shaven for work.</li>
    <li> I was trying to replace my Norelco 1255X because the replacement head was ridiculously expensive (&amp;#62;$50) and the reviews for the updated head was really bad. I opted for this since the whole shaver was &amp;#62;$10 cheaper than the Norelco head and so many reviewers highly rated it. I was sorely disappointed that it gave me a worse shave than my 1.5 years old, worn Norelco blades. So I returned it. I don&#x27;t understand how people are giving it 4 and 5 stars. My facial hair is pretty coarse so maybe that is why it did a poor job. I haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;m going to fork out the dough for the Norelco head.</li>
    <li> I think the razor head is sharper than the Panasonic I had. The battery doesn&#x27;t last as long, but recharges quickly. You can use the recharge cord without having to use the stand.&lt;br /&gt;The literature doesn&#x27;t mention that you can use this razor with shaving cream, but I believe you can since it says you can use it in the shower. I&#x27;ve yet to try it.&lt;br /&gt;You have to take the head off to clean it, although it cleans well with just water, no brush.&lt;br /&gt;The motor sounds a little slow, and it seems to take a while to shave because of the perceived slowness.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this razor.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver. I&#x27;ve owned three or four models of another brand for many years, but the quality has slipped and when my last &amp;#34;Brand R&amp;#34; died, I decided to try Braun. The price was reasonable, it does a good job, replacement heads are cheaper than Brand R and require replacement only every 18 months, not twice a year.</li>
    <li> After years of using a lesser Braun model, I tried this one and am very pleased with the results. I get a closer shave in less time, totally irritation free.</li>
    <li> great function at affordable price , awesome!</li>
    <li> Works great.  reccommend it.</li>
    <li> do good shaving，just as expect.</li>
    <li> I do not use it yet, because it is for my friends. But it looks good!</li>
    <li> Husband loved it!  He had a different model so I was trying to find as close to that as I could because the old model is no more.  He has used it for a few weeks now and loves it.</li>
    <li> I see that this shaver works well for most people but I&#x27;m one of the unhappy minority. If I try to shave off a week&#x27;s growth, the shaver pulls badly and is generally ineffective. However, the smaller sideburn shaver works quite well.</li>
    <li> Good qulity!! and Fast delivery ^^</li>
    <li> Very strong and convenience</li>
    <li> I used the Braun series 3-340s electric shaver one time after receiving it as a Christmas gift. This was the first time I have used an electric shaver in 15 years. Since the shaver I received had a major defect I will describe my experience in two parts. First, shaving quality, then product quality comments. The shaver had to be charged before the first use. I found the shaver gave a very comfortable shave leaving my face smooth and free of any irritation. It ran quietly and was comfortable to hold. Unfortunately the shaver would not start when I tried to use it the second time. The green charging light came on each time it was turned on and blinked continually. It would not run regardless of repeated attempts&lt;br /&gt; and the operating manual comments do not address an issue of this type .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  am now pursuing the vendor for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the replacement shaves as well as the first one I will feel it is a good purchase. I will need to use it for a longer time to fairly comment on the longer term quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I had tried electric razors many years ago and always got the same result...a poor shave with way too much irritation.  I have been looking for ways to decrease the time spent wet-shaving every day and expected to use this new Braun for touch ups and weekends.  Now, I find I prefer using it and only wet-shave for important business or personal occassions.  The product is very well-made and well-packaged.  It couldn&#x27;t be easier to use and probably gives me 85-90% of the result of a wet-shave with about 1/3 of the effort.  I have not experienced ANY irritation with this razor.  It does an OK job when you are in a hurry and can do a great job if you take your time (3-5 minutes).  The pop-up trimmer is excellent too.  I am sorry I didn&#x27;t get one of these years ago.  This razor can also be used with shaving cream in the shower...have not tried this yet but expect it would be great too.  The charge seems to last a couple of weeks and fully recharges in an hour.  Also, in 18 months, you can replace the cutter for about $20 and essentially have a new razor. Clean up after a shave couldn&#x27;t be easier: the razor is a snap to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomically, the razor feels sure and steady in the hand and is very attractive and obviously well made.  I did a lot of research on Amazon and this razor seemed to have the best price vs. performance ratio of all that I looked at.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone could make a mistake with this purchase unless they have an exceptionally heavy beard to contend with.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised.....I have not used it in wet conditions but I am sure it work that way fine too. I&#x27;ve used Brauns for years and they always do well. This on is no exceptin</li>
    <li> The razor works great. The on/off switch is right where I grip the razor, so I inadvertently turn it off at time. Otherwise, nice razor for the price.</li>
    <li> Replaced a 7 series Braun that I loved and had for 12 years. The hair trimmer finally broke on it and I decided to get this new one. This had a great price and it cuts through my thick hair without a problem. Much better then my old shaver that I did take care of and change the blades. This product does feel a little bit cheaper then my old one but doesn&#x27;t everything now a days... I really like that you can get it wet but am still afraid to, lol.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor it will even cut this tough old mans whiskers close...</li>
    <li> I would give a 5 star if I had not experienced trouble in the first one I purchased. The first one simply stop working and I had to abandon it since in Brazil we don´t have any braun technical suport. The device works properly and I use it with shaving foam. Before I tried phillishave but didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaces an older 3-series model; it charges much faster (1 hour instead of 24 hours) and has floating heads which make for a faster, closer shave--and the price is still reasonable!</li>
    <li> It was a gift so I didn&#x27;t see it.</li>
    <li> Shave was fine while it worked. Bought this to replace an older Braun (9 years!) that would no longer hold a charge.  This new one quit working on the 2nd shave. It started up just fine, but the motor slowly ground to a halt and completely stopped. Perhaps I just got a defective one.</li>
    <li> not bad but had better one before and was cheaper</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace my 10-year-old Braun for underarm shaving since electric razors are gentler on the skin. Love it. So easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well with cream. And it works very well without cream.</li>
    <li> I have a light beard and I tried this shaver wet and dry - not even close to a good shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. It is a bit smaller than my previous Braun, the Series 7-790cc Pulsonic, but it seems gentler on my face while still providing a close shave. I chose it because of it&#x27;s low price, but my only regret is I didn&#x27;t spend more for the Braun Series 3-390cc which has the Clean &amp; Renew system. All-in-all I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> A product of excellent quality, fully satisfied, the product met all expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, shaved very flush and suve</li>
    <li> is excelent... good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
    <li> Beats the three headed rotary shavers. Hope the replacement head will not be too costly.</li>
    <li> arrived broke from the factory</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this shaver.  I have had for around a month and now it fails to turn on.  I will be returning it to Braun.  I don&#x27;t think all Braun electric shavers are bad.  I found a 7 Series and it performs very well.  I&#x27;m totally satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> good price,right color,right size,but this is made in china,not german,it makes me a little disappointed,i like using it</li>
    <li> This shaver works great.  I get a very smooth shave.  Its is easy to clean.  The battery last 2 to 3 weeks between charges. The best shaver I have had.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  I purchased it to replace a charger from the same model.  I have had this model for 2 years and still works flawlessly.  I would recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> The shave is good, especially when used with shaving cream.  But after a few weeks, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on after charging.</li>
    <li> it is great!! I  like it very much.</li>
    <li> Anything is good,I like it very much</li>
    <li> arrived on time，in Chinese，“非常不错！”（Good）</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but a bit tough to really get a perfect clean shave in some areas of the neck. For the price I think it&#x27;s good though</li>
    <li> i think this shaver is very good. it takes some getting used to in the beginning. works well dry as well as with gel in shower. it shaves similar to a blade shaver in the way it moves on face. it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as blades bot closer than the rotary type electric shaver. it shaves under the jar born and neck pretty well with some practice. I could never do that with the rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revision: I believe this shaver makes my face break out as did some other electric shavers I tried. I think, rubbing the metal on my face repeatably does that. (I have metal allergy) I am back to Gillette.</li>
    <li> Good product, good choice</li>
    <li> Reasonable and nice price!&lt;br /&gt;What a comfotable to use!</li>
    <li> Perfect water proof shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean shave, minimal irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very useful chargable shaver love it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a Chirstmas present for my boyfriend, and so far he loves it. Only minimal complaint is that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t shave as close in places where skin is loose (like underneath the chin on the neck). Overall, I am satisfied, and so is he.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is very good. Feels solid. Switched from a blade due to skin iritation, I use &#x27;lectric shave&#x27; and shave dry.</li>
    <li> It quit working after less than a month of use. I would like a refund of the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s suggestion that foil/cutter (Braun 30B) be ordered with this item is incorrect.  The Braun website and user manual both specify the cutter/foil cassette 32B (black) or 32S (silver) as the correct part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get power tools ready to open the package. It is apparently designed to survive a nuclear explosion intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I wonder if Amazon will refund the price for the incorrect item they suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver operates well, I believe most users will be satisfied. It charges quickly, cleans easily, and gives a close shave when used daily. If not used daily, obtaining a close shave takes a bit longer and requires more effort. I have used several shavers over the past decades--this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I decided that we were going to try another way of shaving.  This filled the bill.  We are finding out that we don&#x27;t have to shave as often as we did when we used a regular blade shaver.  That is nice.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I expected more, I had to try it more than 4 times in my neck area it is a little bit hard but In my moustache is the opposite, so easy, the battery rocks!</li>
    <li> ️husband is pleased with this razor!</li>
    <li> I get an very nice purchase, Amazon&#x27;s goods could ship outside the USA do much more benefit for me, the goods is strong power and do shave very clear. My choice is right,</li>
    <li> I had a Braun 3 series that has worked well for 5 years, but I wanted a new one. The new one that I bought doesn&#x27;t work any better and maybe give a less closer shave. I am disappointed in the new one.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun razors for years, bought my last one at least six years ago, batteries finally got weak, had to charge every third day. Now I&#x27;m back in business, love my new Braun.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 340S to replace my Panasonic ES8103S.  I was disappointed.  First, it feels like you&#x27;re holding a brick.  Second, there is no comparison between the closeness of shaves.  The Panasonic beats the Braun in almost every facet . . . the only exception is noise.  The Braun is quieter than the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic shaves closer, quicker, charges quicker, and replacement blades are also much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Husband gives two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I am trying to like this shaver. I received it as a gift after my 7000 series would no longer hold a charge. This one is quieter and lighter than my old one, but doesn&#x27;t look or feel near as solid (but it is a much cheaper shaver.) I have used the shaver for over 6 months. The first month of shaving gave a really nice shave, but since then it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as close a shave and feels more abrasive. I would say that the cutter should be replaced every 3 or 4 months. I&#x27;ve been twice painfully bitten by this shaver - the first time when I accidentally switched it off while shaving and it yanked a whisker out, the other time by the narrow joint between the foil and the cutter assembly. The major deficiencies I see with this shaver are: 1) The on/off button is right where your thumb wants to be when holding it, making it very easy to accidentally turn it off while shaving. My older 7000 series had a switch that had to be pressed and then slid upward and so it was practically impossible to turn it off by accident. 2) The plastic cover fits over the cutters and the switch, however it pops off very easily. Rarely will I find it in place even when just sitting in my drawer. The cover won&#x27;t keep the switch from being pressed. I had this shaver in my luggage during a short trip, only to find that the press of the clothes pressed the switch on even with the cover on it. When I got to my destination, the shaver had clearly been turned on, running down the battery, 3) The cutter assembly has a narrow space between the metal foil and the plastic structure around it. It is very easy for a whisker to be caught in that and the whisker will be yanked out - very painful!  In my opinion this shaver is okay for its price, but not near the quality of the older (and more expensive) Braun shavers. For its price, it&#x27;s good but you have to be willing to accept the poorly placed on/off button and beware that the cutter could painfully snag a whisker. It might be that the new high-end Brauns are as good as my old one was and I might try a new series 7 if I get bit by this one again.</li>
    <li> Works great. Hubby gets a really close shave which leads to lots more kissing.</li>
    <li> did not close enough shave for him especially on the neck area, going back to norelco</li>
    <li> Husband really loves the close shave and the fact you can use it with water.</li>
    <li> A good razor. Let&#x27;s see how it behaves when aging</li>
    <li> It looks good. But it&#x27;s size is very large which is out of my expectation. So it is not so convenient to carry on during the tourism.</li>
    <li> good product and price</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a great shaver!</li>
    <li> Braun never disappoints with their quality and performance at the right price.</li>
    <li> worth every penny!  clean close shave every time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this new Braun shaver for two months, but it has performed very nicely so far.  I get a comfortable close shave in less than five minutes.  The pivotal heads that contour to the face are a nice new feature and most notably, the motor is distinctly quieter than my last Braun shaver.  The charging stand that was included is also a nice little extra.&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about this product and there&#x27;s no reason not to highly recommend it.  Well worth the price especially when purchased on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;On a personal note, this is my second Braun shaver.  My first was a series 3 Model 5770 that performed very well also and lasted just three months shy of nine years use without any repairs or problems.  That&#x27;s an awfully good track record in my opinion and the reason I&#x27;d stay with a Braun.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend is so satisfied.</li>
    <li> The razor is OK but I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon includes 3 Braun cleaning station  refills with the combination. NOTE -- Braun does not make a cleaning station for the 3-Series so the cleaning refills are useless . I learned a leason -- do your research on a product from the manufacture --NOT AMAZON before ordering.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a year or so. The build quality and battery life are great but I just cannot get a close shave with it. I think Rotary Razors work best for me. That&#x27;s the thing with Razors, what works great for one person, might not be a close shave at all for the next person, about all you can do is buy it and try.</li>
    <li> This shaver is very good!</li>
    <li> Tried a Norelco that was just awful. Went back to a Braun because of a great product before. Very happy with this purchase. Works well and has a great warranty. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> shaves most areas well. Pulls hair occasionally. Battery life is good. Charge time is quick. seems to be built well.</li>
    <li> Never been a big fan of shavers vs blades, but the ease and convenience of this tipped me over the edge and now I love it.  Not as close as a blade, but shaves WAY closer than the Phillips Norelco I tried previously, and has so far been very durable.  (The philips died after a 3 foot fall from the sink. NOT what I consider durable.) I also find that it doesn&#x27;t cause my beard to take on patterns that make it harder to shave with a blade, which every previous &#x27;triple head&#x27; did. I like to use a blade once a weekend or so, when I&#x27;m not jamming for work. I mostly use it dry, but wet works well, too, maybe even catching some of those &#x27;burr&#x27; spots on my neck better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is MUCH better than I had anticipated - perhaps 2 weeks - and the recharge is quick.  Even after the charge light comes on, you can probably get a couple shaves out of it. You can&#x27;t use it plugged in, but it will quick charge in a few minutes so you can get at least one shave out of it. If this one &#x27;went swimming&#x27; on a sailing trip (like a suicidal norelco I once owned) I&#x27;d definitely buy another!</li>
    <li> From China Sea Amoy, affordable and practical, recommend buy</li>
    <li> It works well. and has powerful cutting force.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for almost a month now. I have been loyal to the Panasonic brand for a long time. Keep in mind the Panasonic I use is almost $200 dollars, so take the comparison with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;1) Braun is quieter than Panasonic, don&#x27;t really care not shaving in a library&lt;br /&gt;2) I get a razor close shave with the Panasonic in 5 minutes. The Braun takes twice as long 10 minutes&lt;br /&gt;3) Battery life on both is excellent. Braun has a quick charge capability I like, Panasonic doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price of the Braun I feel it is a excellent value. If money is no object get the Panasonic 4 blade arc it cuts closer in faster amount of time</li>
    <li> I started with a four inch long full beard.  After scissors I used the trimmer then shaved my beard to Amish style.  Several weeks later, I cut the rest off using scissors then the trimmer and lastly the shaver.  The razor worked better than I expected.  Smooth, no facial burn or cuts and the hair came off easier than I expected.  The clean up of the razor is easy quick.  This is an excellent razor.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product.  Takes a bit of getting used to if you have never used a foil razor.  I use a CPAP and need to shave daily for the mask to seal. The Braun gives a nice clean shave and is perfect for my needs.  As with any product, this might not be right for you.  I do a fair amount of research before I buy any product and this one had good ratings.</li>
    <li> I use this model every morning and it works very well.</li>
    <li> Tough to cut hard beared.</li>
    <li> I read all these mixed reviews about every wet dry shavers from 1 to 5 stars.  The lower star ratings are right that the unit does not get close enough.  However, for someone who is prone to ingrown hair or pimples this was good for me.  It does take a long time to shave and pressing close is needed.  As I said this shaver is not for everyone but it meets my needs.  One way to make this shavver to get close is to alternate between the beard trimmer and the shaving head.</li>
    <li> I rated 5 stars beacause it gives me a clean and close shave. I used before an antic shick flexamatic, this is as good as the Shick, I will recomend it to anyone and the price is right.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. Read many reviews and knew he would like this one.</li>
    <li> We purchased this for my dad who had a stroke.  He can use it easily and it gives a very close shave.</li>
    <li> so far, a decent shaver.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic, I have a heavy beard, not as close as a razor, but close enough.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun wet &amp; dry electric shavers for 20 plus years and older Braun shavers and I simply appreciate how well they work.</li>
    <li> Best Braun I&#x27;ve ever had in we&#x27;ll over 30 years.  Comfortable to hold, battery might go for weeks (I have a light beard), and it shaves very close and without any razor &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Generic shaver probably good for beginners, takes many passes to get just a little hair and not real good for getting sideburns. The pop up trimmer is a little difficult to extend (then sticks out way to far) and I&#x27;ve hit the on/off switch mistakenly several times (on the opposite side) attempting to extend it. The long hair cutter should be on one side rather than in the middle of the 2 normal cutters (why it&#x27;s not good for sideburns), and lastly...this shaver seems to be bigger than it needs to be. I will continue my search for a replacement shaver as this one and I won&#x27;t have a long time relationship.</li>
    <li> Poorly made. Disappointed in the build quality.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Braun and Panasonic shavers and have switched between them. I was disappointed in the quality of my last Panasonic, so I bought this Braun as a replacement. I am shocked to see how poorly this was made. I will be surprised (and happy) if this lasts more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE. The top broke off while I was shaving this morning. There is a metal grinding sound. This has not lasted more than three months. Worst made shaver I have ever used. Braun products have really gone downhill. Will never buy another Braun again.</li>
    <li> Very good, getting used to it, or at least my face. will comment afterwards, but is looking good so far</li>
    <li> This one serves it&#x27;s purpose and it&#x27;s not bad enough to return. I&#x27;ll live with it. My main gripe is I have to go over the same area multiple times to get a clean shave. It seems to have trouble with the wimpy hairs. If you&#x27;re hairy and can grow a thick beard then your results with this shaver may be better. I generally have to do a once over with the trimmer to get the leftover hairs.</li>
    <li> Was an OK shaver for the first few months. Kept it clean, the waterproof feature was nice, and it performed so-so, but not a close shave by any means. Forget about anything more than overnight stubble, could only handle less than 24-hour growth. I don&#x27;t have a particularly tough beard but this shaver really couldn&#x27;t handle it. If I exerted any extra pressure to get the stubble, the whole darn head would pop off, spilling beard shavings all over my shirt. After the third time with the head popping off, I had it. Into the recycling bin it went. Also, the recharge cord was tightly coiled, and the plug end where it meets the shaver was very loose, making plugged-in shaving impossible (which the description claims is possible). Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> This is a decent everyday shaver. Very good at not irritating the skin with a dry shave. Not much of a better shave wet. Wish it could give a closer shave wet.  If you need a very close shave go with a razor but this is good for just everyday shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver is fast and gives a great shave. Trimmer is also very handy. Holds a charge for well over a week.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a shaver this is it and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the notion of a wet electric shave seemed intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the shaver does indeed do the wet electric shave thing, it caused me far more irritation than a dry shave ever has.  So, your mileage may vary on that aspect.  On the other hand, as a dry shaver, the floating foils do a pretty good job following the contours of my face.  The head&#x27;s a bit wide though, and coupled with an inability to pivot, it means that if you need precision trimming around a mustache or a beard, you might not want this model.</li>
    <li> This product has reduced the occurrence of razor bumps to nearly zero.  It has changed my complexion and made shaving extremely easy and efficient.  It does have trouble around the adams apple on the throat.  Other than that it is a great product for wet or dry shaves.</li>
    <li> We have used Braun shavers for years.  This one is as good as the others; great results, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Dad for Father&#x27;s Day.  He always used rotary razors in the past and complained they didn&#x27;t do a good job on his tough beard.  I read for tough beards use a foil razor so after some research I ordered this one for him.&lt;br /&gt;He really likes it, he had never tried a foil razor before and says it is doing a great job on his beard.  He&#x27;s happy and so am I.</li>
    <li> The shaver was very deceiving on your add, and another thing is if the shaver goes dead and you want to use it while your plugged in while your charging it you can&#x27;t. Unless mine isn&#x27;t working popularly?????? Very discuss-ted with the shaver. Whats your comment??????</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Works exactly as it stated. Battery last for a long time. Very close shave. Great price. I couldnt be happier.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly fast growing beard. Normally, I use a razor after I shower at night, followed by use of my Norelco electric shaver in the morning. By 5 PM, the &amp;#34;5 O&#x27;clock Shadow&amp;#34; would be there. With use of the Braun shaver, I can now skip shaving at night now and only shave once a day.</li>
    <li> For the cost of my older Braun replacement foil..I purchased this entire unit. Plus it does shave good wet or dry. Give it try..</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new shaver.  The only things keeping it from being a 5 star rating is the inability to charge while shaving and it is a bit difficult to clean the head.</li>
    <li> Problems: (i) push button on/off:  too easy to accidentally turn unit off while shaving if squeezed slightly. (Slide switch makes much more sense; or relocate away from hold position)&lt;br /&gt;(ii)  the clipper mechanism:  now located on back of shaver which is much more cumbersome when switching between shaving and trimming, as unit must be rotated in hand&lt;br /&gt;(iii)  the shaving head size:  just too big to negotiate around beard near mouth&lt;br /&gt;(iv) the angled head and and size of the head:  make actually seeing where you are trying to cut almost impossible when negotiating around beard&lt;br /&gt;This is the first Braun product I have been really disappointed with. If you have the earlier Braun Series 7000 model, stock up on parts because this unit is a very poor replacement. A waste of money, I wish I&#x27;d never purchased it.</li>
    <li> Lasts a week before needing a charge, with heavy use. Close, clean, unirratating shave.</li>
    <li> Presents for 14 &amp; 17 year old grandsons.  Perfect first shaver.&lt;br /&gt;They are thrilled with the Braun 3Series.&lt;br /&gt;Makes granddad hero!</li>
    <li> Just right.  Much quieter than my older 340 that this replaced.  The previous one I bought 4 years ago wasn&#x27;t holding  a charge very long.</li>
    <li> If you want to use this for your neck hair and jawline, don&#x27;t even waste your money. This machine struggles with the curves on your face.</li>
    <li> Very good and fast shipping  The shaving is fine, but most sound This is my first razor This is the best</li>
    <li> Really good - shaves nicely, holds charge for a long time. 4 stars because I can&#x27;t quite figure out how to shave my neck properly - maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> The price is cheap, easy to clean, but not very clean.</li>
    <li> The Braun is the brand the men in my family love to use.. gives a closer shave, don&#x27;t have to keep going over your face for a good shave!</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun over the past 10 years and they all have worked great. I suggest buying another razor head because when it&#x27;s time to replace it, you&#x27;ll already have it and you won&#x27;t be worried about it not matching your particular model.</li>
    <li> best shave i have gotten from an electric.</li>
    <li> This shaver is MUCH better than his previous shaver of another type.  The shave is close and the shaver is quite quiet.  It was delivered quickly, and was the perfect purchase.  I had priced in a store, and was able to get it $30 less expensive from Amazon!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> useful and convenient.</li>
    <li> not a very close shave</li>
    <li> I can end up with a very close shave with this, but it takes a long time.  I have to go over and over the same section of skin before it feels smooth.  If I skip a day or two on the weekend or vacation, look out, because it doesn&#x27;t handle longer stubble well at all.  I&#x27;ve even used the trimmer to cut down longer (1/16th) so the main shaver will cut it on the next pass.  The shaver also does a poor job of containing the debris.  Don&#x27;t wear a black shirt, or the dust will show on your chest.  I&#x27;ve made adjustments to my routine, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to Norelco when this one&#x27;s done.</li>
    <li> My Husband loves it!  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOve  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  This razor requires going over the same area again and again&lt;br /&gt;to pick up the stubbly.  The Remington that I had was much quicker compared to this Braun 3Series.</li>
    <li> Great shave and long charge battery. The shave is as close as any foil shaver I have used. I would say my beard is about average.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a Christmas gift for my husband who had recently had a major stroke. It does an ok job of shaving but not nearly as good as what I expected.</li>
    <li> I researched the under $100 offerings pretty thoroughly and chose this over similar razors from Norelco and Panasonic.  All seemed strong but I chose the Braun 3Series because it had the fewest negative reviews mentioning poor quality and also had the lowest cost of ownership (infrequent and inexpensive blade replacement).  This is easily the best electric razor I have ever owned, though I will qualify this by admitting that I have only owned 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels solid and is comfortable to use.  It gives an incredibly close shave (not quite as close as a blade but pretty close), handles longer hairs that my old razor missed and easily plows through up to 3 days of beard growth without leaving anything behind.  I get at least 4 weeks of daily use out of a charge and while it does not have a digital indicator, there are 2-3 shaves still in it when the red light starts blinking so plenty of warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints and would unreservedly recommend this to someone looking for great value in a razor under $100.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good... the shave is really close to the skin and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> It actually shaves like a blade on certain parts of the face: under the nose, the entire chin, under the sideburns. On softer parts of the neck it shaves like an electric.[[ASIN:B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]]</li>
    <li> I have tried top-of-the-line Panasonic shavers for years and never received a close shave. I am amazed how close this shave is. If you have incredibly sensitive skin, this is the shaver for you.&lt;br /&gt;No Blade can come close to this degree of delicate yet close shaving.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a Norelco triple head that I had for many years. Read all the reviews and felt this model was the best value for the money. Have had it now a few weeks and it does shave pretty close in most places except for the jaw line.  Yet it can not match the smoothness I get with a razor.  I was able to get 4 or 5 shaves in even after the red light came on that alerts you to the fact that the charge is running low.  Reasonably happy with the closeness so I&#x27;d say I got what I expected.</li>
    <li> After coming from a very old shaver, this one is a huge improvement, but I can&#x27;t say it blew me away. It is very durable, holds a good charge and seems to last forever. It doesn&#x27;t seem to catch all the hair like I thought a brand new shaver would however. I prefer the 3 circular blades over the inline blades. On my next purchase I think I will go back to a style that has the three circular blades. Fortunately, I don&#x27;t see that happening for many years, because this one seems like it is going to last for a good long time.</li>
    <li> The head works good even on 2-3 day beard. The trimmer works but is at a different angle</li>
    <li> I replaced an electric shaver that I had had for 5 or 7 years with this shaver. I read a lot of reviews and thought I was getting something rather awesome, but to be honest, I&#x27;m not that impressed. The blade on the back is just not sharp/powerful enough to cut through a week or more&#x27;s worth of growth without a ton of passes and the same goes for the main shaving top as well. I&#x27;m seriously tempted to get the spinning kind that claim to cover more surface area and offer a closer shave, because I&#x27;m frankly disappointed with this. Note, I don&#x27;t have that much hair growth after a week&#x27;s worth of time, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m expecting some herculean effort out of this thing. In closing, this is an \\&quot;ok\\&quot; electric shaver, but absolutely nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works with wet skin&lt;br /&gt;The charger is the same for the base as well as to plug into the device directly&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had any battery issues (holds a charge just fine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not that powerful&lt;br /&gt;Blade on back could be wider&lt;br /&gt;Heavily inflated reviews (IMHO).</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied !!!</li>
    <li> Great, close shave every time. Loving this so far!</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver--may buy a second one dfor someone else</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good choice as a gift.</li>
    <li> made in china&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
    <li> It  does not cut as close as I&#x27;d like but works fine.</li>
    <li> Product is very good&lt;br /&gt;Do not regret my choice&lt;br /&gt;You should buy this really good</li>
    <li> This review is specifically for the Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver.  I&#x27;m a long time Braun fan, and have used the Braun 6820 foil shaver for years. They seem to last 5 years or so before the battery dies - and my last one just did so a month ago.  While I was disappointed that I can no longer find the model I&#x27;m used to, I researched the available options and decided to try the 340S-4.  My original order was mysteriously returned before it even arrived, so I contacted Amazon - kudo&#x27;s to Amazon customer service who helped me to get another on order immediately and even waived the next-day shipping.&lt;br /&gt;The new shaver arrived and I immediately charged it up. I like the charger base, very convenient to stand the razor on and charge when not in use. The razor is light and comfortable to hold, but noticeably bulkier than the old model. This one won&#x27;t fit in my travel kit, and it did not come with a travel case. It did come with a plastic shield to protect the foil and keep the power button from being depressed in a suitcase. The first thing I noticed when using the razor however is that the dual-foil design has the shorter foils spaced further apart with the long-hair cutter between. The model I formerly used has longer, narrower foils and is easier to maneuver over the face. A dry-shave with this razor is noticeably not as close as my previous razor. It does a somewhat better job when my beard is longer (1.5-2 days growth) than when trying to dry-shave a shorter 5:00 shadow. I don&#x27;t normally use any electric-shave pre-shaving product, perhaps that would help.  This morning I tried it in the shower for the first time as a wet shaver. I quickly discovered that it is useless without some lubricant (I soaped my face with  bar soap). Again, it did a passable job, but still not the closeness I am accustomed to. I guess I&#x27;ll keep it, but my next razor purchase will certainly be less than 5 years from now...</li>
    <li> Shaver was much less able to handle everyday growth than a blade.  It was unable to shave soft bristles growing on the neck.  More than two day beard growth was painful.  Less effective than circular shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Braun shaver, Series 1, just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Philips as good, if not better.</li>
    <li> I first used the rotary type of shaver years ago and was never satified with the shave.  Then I went to Remington (remembering the days of &amp;#34;if not satisfied, I&#x27;ll give you your money back&amp;#34;).  I think Remington and Norelco are now the same company.  I was totally unsatisfied with the Remington, complained, and did not even get a &amp;#34;sorry&amp;#34; letter in response, let alone my money back.  I then looked around and went with my first Braun.  For my beard and face, it shaved better than any electric I&#x27;ve ever owned.  After about eight years and many screen and blade changes, the battery died.  I don&#x27;t need a cleaner and all of the other bells and whistles, jsut a razor that works. So I went with the 340 series.  It works better than my old Braun, getting stubble the Remington and Norelco always missed and that my older Braun was beginning to miss. I still need to do an occasional trim with my Quatro 4 and like sometimes to switch to a reguar shave with a Quatro 4 when I want an absolutely close shave. I have to use at least a 4-blade standard razon to get any kind of a clean shave, less than that will not work.  But for me, this razor is as close to a blade shave as I can get and, even with the cost of screen replacements, I save a lot of money on Quatro replacement blades.</li>
    <li> cuts the beard, but takes much longer than with a blade, so to save time a blade is better.  also the temptation to walk around while shaving opens the possibility to scattering whisker shavings all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;being able to use the shaver in the shower with soap, shampoo, lotion is a big plus.</li>
    <li> very good，I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the wet &amp; dry shaver, I tried it both dry and then wet and it does work both ways.  I had intended to use it in the shower but changed my mind when I thought of the damage I may cause if I dropped it.  I have also noticed that using shave cream does not necessarily shave any closer but it sure is easier on the face.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance and he loves it...I high recommend this his shave is so smooth and nice :)</li>
    <li> Gave a terrible shave.  After 7 or 8 passes and still I had stubble I decided to return.  Going to try a Remington.</li>
    <li> Terrific for me I hope the same for you!!!</li>
    <li> Shaves well (not great, but well).  Sounds/feels solid.  Nice trimmer.  Shave could be closer, faster to cut all hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> The shaver is good, doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin and is well designed, but my beard is very thin so is hard for the shaver to work properly in some areas like the neck and chin (if you have this problem, be aware and look out for a more powerfull shaver).</li>
    <li> Good and convenient, easy to manage. The fully-sealed body can be used with shaving foams and gels in the shower.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a travel razor and have been using it about 6 months now. Some thoughts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Charge holds forever&lt;br /&gt;* Does an outstanding job of &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; shaves -- 1 day growth is comfortably gone without a thought&lt;br /&gt;* Wet/Dry &#x3D; easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Worthless on 2+ day growth -- better off trying to pull off the rugged look instead&lt;br /&gt;* Sideburn trimmer not very powerful&lt;br /&gt;* Charging station is not very portable, can&#x27;t simply plug the razor into a wall plug without big charging apparatus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with the buy. Just make sure to use this thing every single day, or you will need a real razor to get you back to smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the process of mailing this item back. During routine cleaning when the&lt;br /&gt;razor head was removed, parts started to fall off of it, making the electric razor&lt;br /&gt;inoperable. A replacement razor is in the process of being mailed to me. Braun is&lt;br /&gt;usually a very good and reliable product. As this is the first time this has happened&lt;br /&gt;I fully intend to keep using Braun electric razors.</li>
    <li> It works well for the price. I paid around $50 for it. It doesn&#x27;t shave my neck area that well, but I have no complaints they way that it shaves the rest of my face. Electric shavers can be expensive, so this is a good deal for the price that I paid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used disposable razors for several years. After I had back surgery two months ago, I made a few habit changes to make life a little easier during my recovery. Buying this electric razor was one of these changes-- less time spent bending over at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My impression is that even the best electric razor doesnt cut hair quite as close as the cheapest handheld blade, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m unsatisfied with this purchase. Shaving is fast and easy, and looks pretty good as well. The sideburn trimmer is an excellent supplementary feature. I&#x27;m really pleased with the battery life in particular. After the first full charge, I didn&#x27;t see the red battery light until about 3 weeks-- way longer than I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had this razor for very long, and can&#x27;t really compare it to much, but I love it all the same.</li>
    <li> I have used quite a few electric razors marketed for women, and have been so disappointed. I finally decided to check out one geared toward men, and purchased this one because of all of the positive reviews. I am so happy with this purchase. It gives me such a close shave, and I love that there is a trimmer on the other side for longer hair, which is just as effective. Very glad I got this! And highly recommend for other women looking for another alternative to shaving with a razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased for myself and for use on my legs and I wanted a low charge warning light, which this one had.  I used twice and it was never a close shave so I&#x27;m back to my old shaver.  I would rate the performance on this product very poor.</li>
    <li> Has been a great buy.  I still use it every day without any problems</li>
    <li> The  got great reviews so I fell for it.  It looks nice but it&#x27;s cheaply built.  The main area of the foil shaver does not get all whiskers.  If you skip a day or two, it misses the longer whiskers - especially in the mustache area. The trimmer portion is horrible.  It cuts about every 20th hair and you have to go over it 3 or 4 times and it still looks patchy.  If I could give it half a star I would.  Very disappointing, as it was an expensive purchase.  So I&#x27;m on the look-out now for a better product.  I&#x27;m definitely going to try a different manufacturer.  I&#x27;ll post about it as well.</li>
    <li> A nice, comfortable shave. Compares quite well with my old Wahl shaver. I have been using the Braun for approximately a month. I would probably purchase this model again.</li>
    <li> Works like a Braun!! This shaver stays at work and serves it purpose great. Even better than my old 360 that is still going strong after 8 years!</li>
    <li> This is the worst electric razor I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t come close to giving me a good shave and I&#x27;ve tried using it dry and wet.  I have to go over the same spot seven times before it is even remotely close to a razor shave and takes five times as long to shave.  Even after I shave my face raw I still have to get out a razor if I want a good shave.  Wish I had never bought it.</li>
    <li> Shaves close and doesn&#x27;t cause discomfort.</li>
    <li> The Braun 340s is cool, I like it so much.&lt;br /&gt;The logistics very fast, it just take 6 days from American to my home of Shanghai,China.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> It was just what my husband wanted.</li>
    <li> The razor was meant to be gift. Apart from functioning well gifts usually look nice but not in this case. Its works fine but the weird face my father made when he first saw the damaged package said it all …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only buy if you don’t care what it looks like … so don’t buy it for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The price is cheap, well-cut beard.</li>
    <li> can &#x27;t go wrong for the price, good shave wet and dry</li>
    <li> I am an electric wet-shaver:  I like the ease-of-use, and ability to shave after a morning shower.  (I don&#x27;t shave while showering, and like to use a mirror to make sure I&#x27;ve got all the facial hair.)&lt;br /&gt;- I always use hot-water to rinse the shaver during the shave.&lt;br /&gt;- big fan of Bigelow shaving cream (green tube), just a pea size amount works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a big fan of the Panasonic wet shaver, and I upgraded to the Panasonic ES-8103 last year (after having owned my previous Panasonic for almost 10 years).  But it seemed to start shorting-out, and the display started going out, and finally would intermittently be unable to power-on.  If you read the reviews of the Panasonic&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll see that there (actually) is a fair percentage of failures.  Not good, but hard to detect unless you read past the 5-star ratings it does get:  read, they&#x27;ve got a lemon problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went with this Braun 340S.&lt;br /&gt;* seems to shave just as close.&lt;br /&gt;* it&#x27;s smoother, less noisy, and shaves in less time.&lt;br /&gt;* has no problem with the neck (adam&#x27;s apple) area, without causing cuts.&lt;br /&gt;* is less prone to incidental cuts (compared to the Panasonic).&lt;br /&gt;* doesn&#x27;t require the recommended new blades every 6 months, of the Panasonic.  (Braun recommends 18 mos.)&lt;br /&gt;* cleanup is easier, barely requires anything more than a rinse;  where the Panasonic required extensive rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only place the Panasonic is better, as far as I can tell:  it has a better battery, and could almost last 5-6 days on a full charge.  The Braun appears it will only last 3-4 days, but I haven&#x27;t yet run it down to empty (since that is a tough battery cycle to endure, and I would hate to ruin a new shaver).</li>
    <li> Well it has been years since I have owned am electric foil shaver and the memories were not great. After going through two Remington rotary shavers (10 yrs) I thought it high time I looked at something else. I had never owned a Braun and well the reviews here on Amazon were enough to pique my interest. I was getting used to the 4 blade hand shaver and thought &amp;#34;who really needs a fancy electric shaver.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was until Amazon sent me an email for this razor: $39. No question, I ordered it. It arrived and I eagerly tried it, no prep, straight in. My rotary razors would have chugged and ground, but not this thing. It felt really smooth on my face and I could not believe the finish it left. Wow, it truly felt as close as the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier, and I am sure with care, this razor will serve me well for many years.</li>
    <li> Its water proof and looks kewl but the razor does not but all cut good, I have to go over and over the area for it to even come close to cutting it all. Not a fan at all, its like it doesn&#x27;t even have any blades!</li>
    <li> I am 78 years old. Make that 78 years young. This shaver ,of all that I have ever owned, IS the very best. Could not get as good of a shave even with my regular razor blade razor.</li>
    <li> The trimmer broke within a month. Now its so much of a hassle getting it fixed I&#x27;m just dealing without.</li>
    <li> I have this and i love the way it cleans the hair. the blades are very precise.</li>
    <li> Since I shave in the shower I wanted something that I could use in the shower. I was hoping that I could use it just as is without the fuss of lathering up as with a blade but it is more comfortable to use lather. It is not the time saver that I expected but I don&#x27;t have to worry about nicks.</li>
    <li> Shaves well, but vibrated too strong, the sound is harshness, farthermore, the Long Hair Trimmer is not very firm!!!</li>
    <li> Its not a close shave</li>
    <li> Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time my husband has had a Braun and he is very satisfied.  He says it is the best!</li>
    <li> best portable shaver i ever had...smooth face and ease to clean .love it.....can t say enough good things about this shaver</li>
    <li> So far so good. Second electric razor I&#x27;ve owned. Both have been Braun, and had good results</li>
    <li> Works great. My elderly dad loves it.</li>
    <li> When my current $120 shaver developed a problem that caused the battery to run down after about 2.5 shaves unexpectedly (started going from 80% charge to zero right in the middle of a shave), I started researching again to see what I could find at a reasonable price. I also didn&#x27;t want to spend $120 again, but wanted to stay close to $50. After trying other brands recently and only being marginally satisfied, I decided to look at Braun shavers. Since the Series 5 shavers are $150+, I started looking at Series 3 shavers. This shaver was over $60 at one local place, then found it right at $60 at another local store. Then I found it online at only $40! The best part is that it shaves just as well as my $120 shaver but at 1/3 of the price! It&#x27;s a very close shave that leaves my face &amp; neck feeling nice &amp; smooth, and left behind very little stray neck hairs (which many shavers have had trouble with on my neck).</li>
    <li> I had the original Series 3 for years and it finally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34;.  I tried the latest replacement and found it excellent.  I dry shave and don&#x27;t need the extra features but tried them and  they are excellent as well.  I  really like the head and shape of the shaver.  I highly recommend this basic shaver.  Glad I bought it.  I know I can depend on Braun for quality.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  It works great.</li>
    <li> You can almost rub your wiskers off quicker than cutting them with this razor.  I had a Series 7 for several years and the difference in power is substantial -- this one just doesn&#x27;t cut it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while, for a few months. But my skin still gets irritated every time I shave with this shaver. This shaver noise level is like a paving breaker-hammer. With that kind of noise level it should be at least shaving well but it does NOT! Avoid this Braun shaver and go for Phillips Norelco!</li>
    <li> I SHAVE PERIODICALLY WITH A WET SHAVER BUT DRY IN BETWEEN SHAVES. NOW I CAN DO BOTH WITH ONE CONVENIENT PRODUCT. IT IS WORKING VERY WELL WITHOUT CHARGING CONSTANTLY&#x27;</li>
    <li> good shaver for the money</li>
    <li> GAME CHANGER. Imagine a close, smooth shave without leaving your facial skin dry. I actually enjoy shaving now.</li>
    <li> The charging cord adapter which goes into bottom of shaver for charging is not secure. It will not click in securely and will disconnect easily thus stopping the charging process.</li>
    <li> Sweet purchase for my teenage son now that he actually &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34;. Excellent quality and ease for those younger guys who are just learning. Charges quickly and removal of his stache only takes a few minutes with no facial irritation. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Shaver seems very superior to the other I owned in the past. They have&lt;br /&gt;made them better then older models.</li>
    <li> This does not provide a good, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Remington F5800 which DID provide a close, good shave. Unfortunately after 2 years it died. Despite being a similar price, this Braun series 3 just does not measure up. 60 bucks down the drain!</li>
    <li> it need more time to clean and shave my beard and the beard always mess on the clothes, not convenient to care</li>
    <li> I love the shaver. Follow the charging instructions for the first few charges, and it will work great. Though, like many electric shavers, the blades wear out quickly.</li>
    <li> A breeze to use when I needed a replacement for an older model. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Charge lasts for using it several times. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a couple elf years now and the battery seems to be getting a shorter charge life than normal. I understand it is normal for rechargeable batteries to do that, but it is a significant decrease. Also, the cutting is good, not great. There are some parts of the blade area that just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut well. Could be a dull blade, but it was like that after a couple months in and I don&#x27;t shave everyday.</li>
    <li> Does not give a close shave</li>
    <li> Had to make the switch from razors to an electric shaver because of a pulmonary Embolism and the need for taking blood thiners.&lt;br /&gt;and not using a electric razor for 35 years i was a little worried...but after the first couple of shaves i wont be going back.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews are led me to this unit and I could not be happier...I have tried wet shaving with special cream....but dry shaving with this unit for me is the best....the added side trimmer works great on your ears and mustache too...the charge lasts a good two weeks....again great solid product....must have..just need to go over the areas a couple times in different directions and your skin is baby smooth like a razor..</li>
    <li> Great shave and easy clean up.  I do have difficulty when I shave my neck but other then that I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This razor does a very good job especially on two-day growth.  Would not go back to the less expensive brand I have used for years--Brand R!</li>
    <li> I liked this shaver until after only 2-3 months use, it just stopped working for no good reason!</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this. Price was excellent but it&#x27;s really not effective at cutting my hairs (I believe mine grow in a few different directions, frustratingly). It&#x27;s a good price but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer on the back is great, though, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Braun is Lighting shavers&lt;br /&gt;NO irritation  &amp; has smooth shaving&lt;br /&gt;has clean shave&lt;br /&gt;good price &amp;  Gift for good&lt;br /&gt;hipping is fast</li>
    <li> One of the closest shaves you&#x27;ll get from an electric.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price you pay. Battery life is great even though I don&#x27;t shave everyday.</li>
    <li> I was pleased from the first ! Packaging was first rate and all accessories needed to operate for at least a year included. The machine itself is very substantial feeling in the hand and looks like it will last a long time. My attempts to master an electric razor goes back some years and this one shows much promise. Am going to have to do some research on pre shave and after shave I suppose as the Electic seems to need different style than my usual blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a lovely shade of blue to annoy my kids. ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over 6 months now.  It still cuts well, but not nearly as well as a regular face shaving razor.  I use it when travelling - and otherwise maybe 3-4 days a week when I don&#x27;t feel like getting lathered up and shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans well, but the housing seems very plasticky and much cheaper than the Braun 9000 series razor that it replaced.  That was a great razor that lasted over 8 years.  I hope this one lasts at least that long.  The battery life is excellent on this.  When I travel, I never take my charger.  Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> It sucks. Typical electric shaver. They don&#x27;t work for crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only redeeming value is the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Bad shave, surprisingly failed to cut some of my facial hair, or any facial hair for that matter. Returned, and bought a Philips Powertouch which works awesome.</li>
    <li> did not do what i wanted</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, everything I expected</li>
    <li> I have had this almost a month now and I am liking it very much. First electric shaver in years and much better than the old one for sure. I have read about people using different lotions while shaving with this. I read where one guy uses hair conditioner and I have to say it  works pretty good for me also. I&#x27;m about 50/50 wet dry use. The cutter head pops off easily and I&#x27;ll usually pop it off a time or two and run it under hot water when shaving. Bottom line I like it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be a closer shave but just slightly better than Norelco</li>
    <li> Love this electric razor. I have very sensitive skin and this is just what works for me. Clean and smooth shave everytime. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase a Braun. I have used many electric razors before but have never had one like this.</li>
    <li> Baby good, sold to the father, he is very love. Shave the beard is very clean, the motor is powerful.</li>
    <li> After many years decided to try an electric razor. What a pleasant surprise . It shaves just great. Am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed</li>
    <li> Reliable and works well.</li>
    <li> I gave up on electric shavers about 5yrs ago. None of them would work. The only one that came close was a norelco, but it tore my face up to much. Went back to straight edge. At 72yrs old my fine skin can&#x27;t take all nicks and cuts. I bought this Braun as a last ditch effort. I should have done this a long time ago. It&#x27;s the best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was still in the box. Then I thought the cover may still be on. Nope. Then I thought it has a wrapper over the cutting system. Nope. This is without a doubt the worst electric shaver I have ever bought. It is my sixth Braun and I am using my five year old model with five year old cutters and screens. If I can&#x27;t return it I will give them a -25 Stars.</li>
    <li> Husband who has Alzheimers constantly thinks his razor needs replacing (because he forgets to clean it).  I go behind him daily to clean, and t works like a dream.  It&#x27;s easier than rotorary blade shavers for him to clean.  I&#x27;ll keep buying replacement parts for this one as he&#x27;s gone through 3 razors.</li>
    <li> This shaver is better than my previous rotary shaver which cost over twice as much. I can shave in less time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave isn&#x27;t quite as good a blade but it&#x27;s very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first charge on the battery lasted for 2 1/2 weeks versus 2 weeks the old one. It charged in an hour as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great shave for electric razor -- not quite as close as using a standard razor with shaving cream but close.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several dozen shavers over the years, spending a great deal of money on various models from Braun, Norelco, Sanyo, Panasonic, Phillips, Remington, and others, both foil and rotary. trying to find the best electric shaver for my rough beard that&#x27;ll give me a close shave day in and day out without irritating my skin.  Mostly I&#x27;ve ended up disappointed.  But ,so far, I&#x27;m on my second Braun 340 wet/dry and very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is the second one that I have bought of this series 3..  First one worked great but plastic rim holding blades broke.  Thought I would give it one more try.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my son, but it works so well I sneak into his bathroom sometimes and use it myself.  Hope he does not read this.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it and likes it but he says they all are not as good as they used to be or could be.</li>
    <li> powerful and easy to clean and use I would recomend this shaver for anyone that wants a quick close shave</li>
    <li> Nearly totally ineffective as a razor. Did a terrible job with new growth, several days growth, thick hair, and peach fuzz. Just awful at everything. On top of not being good at shaving, it caused significant irritation and redness (which has never happened with any other razor I&#x27;ve used.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have a cheap three head Norelco razor, and while not anywhere near as good as using a blade, it is at least passable for a quick shave. This Braun is worthless though.</li>
    <li> the shaver provides a close shave on the sideburns and chin area, and a decent but not great shave on ther neck area as well. the shaver runs smoothly and quietly and does not have a large cleaning station. The shaver however does not run on AC power from the war, it must be charged with a cord and then removed from the cord when fully charged in order to work.Shaver does not irritate the neck or chin area and it can be used under the shower or with running water. works best with a wet shave for me. can cut straight, short, or curly hair does not matter. Braun shavers are currently the best foil shavers out there on the market and one of the best overall shaving brands out there. its a must buy if you suffer from skin irritation and have straight, short or long hair!!!</li>
    <li> I have owned countless Panasonic wet/dry shavers over the past 15 years and replaced my last busted Panasonic with this Braun shaver.  My review compares this Braun to the Panasonic shavers I&#x27;ve had.  I have owned regular Panasonic shavers as well as the ones with the &amp;#34;Linear&amp;#34; motor.  I&#x27;ve had the Braun for about 2 months now.  I have a pretty thick beard that&#x27;s still somewhat visible after any type of shave (electric or razor) and I must shave everyday.  Regular razors tear up my skin and cause breakouts, so I have to use an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shave (while in shower):&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is so much quieter than any Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  The Braun does a nice job with a little bit of foam shaving cream (I don&#x27;t recommend shaving gels since they are too thick).  My shave comes out very close and it only takes about 2-3 minutes.  The only part of my face that doesn&#x27;t come out well is my neck.  I usually have to do some touch-ups on my neck after I get out of the shower.  I would say the Braun shaves slightly better than Panasonic and a few minutes faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave:&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving performance is not acceptable if I was going into work the same day.  It simply doesn&#x27;t shave close enough for my boss&#x27; liking.  But it&#x27;s close enough for weekends and days off.  Dry shaving is super quick.  But I would say the Panasonic shavers work better for dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other random thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;The Braun seems well made and is a bit bigger than the Panasonic shavers.  It charges in an hour using a NiCd battery and I can get about 8-9 days out of a single charge (I expect to charge the unit more often as the battery ages).  The trimmer works fine. It also comes with an international voltage charger and a protective cap for the blades to be used when travelling.  Braun&#x27;s marketing material claims this shaver will last 7 years, but I really doubt it!  This model of Braun is one of the few Brauns that can be used in the shower- most Brauns are dry shave only.  So pay attention to the specs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this shaver better than Panasonic shavers.  The problem I have with Panasonic shavers is that the rubber seals break after about 1-1.5 years.  When the seals break, water gets in the unit causing the display to malfunction and for the unit to not charge. Panasonic offers a 2 year warranty on most shavers and I sent a couple of shavers in to be serviced, but the seal ALWAYS breaks again a few months later.  Then when you get close to the end of the 2 year warranty, the dilemma is &amp;#34;Do I send it in to be serviced again and replace the blades and foil  (which are about forty to fifty bucks) and risk it breaking again, or do I buy a new shaver for about ten bucks more?&amp;#34;  I always chose to buy a new shaver.  (Of course if you use the Panasonic for dry shaving only the seals should be ok for years.)  The other problem with Panasonic shavers is the &amp;#34;Linear&amp;#34; motor, which uses a lithium ion battery and is much more powerful than their standard shavers which use NiCd batteries.  The Linear motor is so powerful that the vibration loosens up the shaver&#x27;s case and blade cartridge in a few months and causes the unit to rattle VERY loud when beng used.  Interestingly, I found no difference between the shave quality of Panasonic&#x27;s  Linear or standard shavers, but the Linear is a faster shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the 3-340s shaver although I had some difficulty getting used to the stationary head on my old shaver.</li>
    <li> Nothing to crow about for comfort and closeness, it does seem to be a sturdy unit (water proof.)</li>
    <li> Good shaver I wish it would shave as good as the Wahl shaver.  It serves my purpose I am a barber, but I could use one thats cuts a close with out having to turn it side ways or pulling out the attachment mustache trimmer!!!  Also, shaves wet, I think thats great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco rotary shavers for years and decided to try something else.  The reviews on this shaver were ok, so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my father.I also tried, very good.</li>
    <li> bought it in may 2015 and like other reviewers mentioned it stop working in June 2015.  Wish I read the other 1 star review before wasting my money.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave anything, better buy an regular shaver than this useless electric shaver!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like i have been cheated!</li>
    <li> One of the better shavers that I have purchased. I use it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because I have not tried the more pricey shavers which may be better. But this would be hard to beat at this price.</li>
    <li> i was excited to get this shaver. it was my first electric razor and i don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to so i rat this just ok in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He will only use a Braun; he is very pleased with this model as it is very easy to care for and does a good job with his morning shave.  Great shaver for under $100.</li>
    <li> Mikey likes it! Great razor for by husbands tough beard!</li>
    <li> i never used one before but this one works great&lt;br /&gt;easy maintenance and cuts very well&lt;br /&gt;very pleased and happy with it</li>
    <li> The Braun 340s works well  and is easy to operate gives a good shave and trim. I have not had any problems with it . Would recomend it highly</li>
    <li> I wrote I had not received this.  Just found it.  It was something else that was misdirected.  This is fine.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun foil shavers for many years. Tried all the other brands... Remington, Norelco, Panasonic, et.al. Used properly, this Braun (&amp; the rest of their models) provides a shave as close as any professional blade can give you. Lately I&#x27;ve been lazy and use it every other day. This gives my skin a good chance to &amp;#34;rest.&amp;#34; On my off day, I just shave my mustache area as well as just above the chin... so I look like a B.U.M. (bum-in-training). If you&#x27;ve never use a high speed foil shaver, you&#x27;ll want to try different hand grips, angles of attack and mix up your levels of pressure, depending on the specific area you are shaving at that moment. Because of the built in curve of the Braun shaver, you will find that flipping it over will give you different/better results on certain areas, i.e. under chin, mustache, etc. it actually depends on YOUR face and its unique &amp; often subtle features. I&#x27;m pretty sure John Merrick used a Braun Electric Foil and look what it did for him.... he was famous!  Buy this shaver at this low price, you won&#x27;t regret it. DC</li>
    <li> Great shaver, smooth and reliable. Not what I expected out of this foul shaver. Previous versions left me with rashes, aka razor burn.</li>
    <li> Compared to my old Panasonic, it&#x27;s lighter, narrower (less surface area) and holds a charge better. much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the more narrow head is actually a plus for me because it allows me to shave in various directions under my neck without having to resort to the circular motion.</li>
    <li> A world of difference compared to my last shaver. A much more well thought out design that shaves very well and is much more comfortable to use. Also trims very nicely. Though the charging pedestal is a tad derpy.</li>
    <li> Slightly larger than the noise, it become warm, but a good deal</li>
    <li> just OK at best,  if you don&#x27;t mind following up with a hand razer everytime you shave, then this is the shaver for you.</li>
    <li> I did not take it&lt;br /&gt;I want it before Friday because i will not be here</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days, but I&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is much closer than any of the rotary blade shavers I&#x27;ve owned over the years (Remington, Norelco).  The unit is well built and lacks the flimsiness I&#x27;ve noticed with a lot of other units&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said the shaver does require a little more attention to detail than the rotary style.  You have to attack your face from a couple of different angles to make sure you catch the grain of your stubble.  This unit also requires a little maintenance with occasional application of machine oil (not a big deal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A blade razor will shave more closely, but this is much less of an undertaking.</li>
    <li> Terrible shaving job.  Misses more than hair than it cuts.</li>
    <li> Nice and quite!  Been pleased so far.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  I agree with some of the reviews I read before purchasing it, namely that it is quiet, comfortable, works very well.  I can get a \\&quot;blade smooth\\&quot; shave with this shaver.  I have not used it with lather, but have appreciated the fact that the foil and cutter can be rinsed under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks are that it is made in China, not in Germany like my last Braun, and the recharging stand feels a little tippy (even though it isn&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> We bought this for my husband to replace a braun he has had for a good 7+ years.  He has a very rough beard and has issues with hairs that grow in multiple directions on his neck so he was worried that this wouldn&#x27;t get all of those hairs. After several weeks of use, he is very happy with how well it shaves and he has had no issues with ingrown hairs or areas that don&#x27;t get shaved as well as others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for over 50 years and FINALLY, I&#x27;VE FOUND ONE THAT REALLY WORKS. I&#x27;ve tried almost every other brand with varied results, but none of them can compare with this one. It&#x27;s sharp, quiet, powerful and the lenth of the charge really suprised me.&lt;br /&gt;I never wash it, nor use any cream or shaving gel and the cut is perfect. I shake out the head and brush the body - period.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to mislead anyone so I must say that I do not have a heavy beard. I have recommended this razor to many folks.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mach 3 razors for years. I typically shave every other day and just use bar soap instead of shaving cream. Hey, it works fine! And it only took me a minute or two to shave my face. But then I decided to try a shaver because I was tired of buying mach 3 refills. So I ordered the Braun shaver, mostly because of the name. But when I started shaving with it, I found that it missed a lot of hairs all over my face and neck. I had to go over particular areas on my face and neck over and over again. Compared to the Mach 3, shaving with the Braun took much longer to complete. I was hoping that using the Braun shaver would allow me to skip the soaping of my face step and thus make it a quicker shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 3 weeks hoping things would get better. But nothing changed. Fortunately they have a 60 day money back guarantee so I boxed it all back up and sent it to Braun. It took awhile (about two months), but they finally sent me the refund in the form of a pre-loaded credit card. Thankful that I got a refund, but hate that I have to use an exact total of $76.99.</li>
    <li> Was replacing my 10 year old+ Braun 6550 (which was the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned) and wanted something comparable.  Was not into all of this wet cleaning stuff.  Just wanted a solid performer with out bells and whistles.  The 340S-4 is it.  GREAT shave, long charge time and easy to pack up and take on the road.  Love the thing.</li>
    <li> Always bought norelco shavers.  When my old norelco died I bought a senco touch 2D wet and dry.  Just didn&#x27;t do the job.  So purchased the Braun 340s wet and dry shaver.  What a world of difference.  Braun is superior to the norelco.  I&#x27;m a Braun person now.  Of course no electric shaver will get as close as a blade, but how often do you need to shave so close you face feels like a baby&#x27;s butt?  As electric goes I&#x27;d say the Braun 340s is as good as it gets.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and beard is not that heavy.  Can&#x27;t speak for those hairy dudes with the heavy beards.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 15 years and I have used other brands but not Braun. This time I switched to a Braun 340s-4. It is beyond a doubt the best shaver I have used. Shaves are smooth, close, and the shaver does not iritate the skin. It is very easy to clean under running water. Great product and properly priced.</li>
    <li> I have used the Norelco and the Panasonic shavers.  Both were good, no real complaints.  But when I need a new shaver I went with this one based on price and customer reviews.  I am not at all sorry I did.  I shave my whole head and face so my shavers get a work-out.  The Braun delivers a close, comfortable shave - and more than that would be asking a shaver to be more than a mere shaver.  I have no problems with any of the contors the shaver must negoiate.  I certainly would recommend this to any friend who should ask my opinion about whether it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Shaving is quick and simple with this and it gives a very close shave without irritation.  Neck hair is still a little tricky but I found the the popup trimmer on this is awesome for trimming very close and finishing with the foils.  There&#x27;s not much mention about the awesome popup trimmer on these reviews but I can tell ya, it&#x27;s almost worth buying this just for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/8/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shaver, the popup trimmer flew off and there was a broken piece of plastic that held it together laying next to the trimmer.  The replacement did the same exact thing!!!  C&#x27;mon...  Ordered the 7 series and hopefully it works without falling apart or I may just have to try a new Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Good Price. But, Cuting is under 5&amp;7 Series</li>
    <li> i have tried several electric razors over the years, usually prefer rotary shavers but bought this based on recommendations.  After a month or so, i am happy with this one.  Have not used it &#x27;wet&#x27;, but for my normal morning shave it is about as good as any i have tried (Norelco and Panasonic, most recently).  Will see how long it lasts, but it seems to be a good value.</li>
    <li> This would be very good for any user of an electric shaver. It is comfortable to hold and comfortable against the face. It has a handy stand-up holder that can be plugged in to charge the shaver. The shaver can also be plugged in directly. The motor runs fast for a quick clean shave.</li>
    <li> Amazing performance! Recommended!</li>
    <li> This razor was a replacement for an aging Braun 5614.  This razor is better in a few key ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The 340S comes with a charging stand and a clear plastic cap for the shaver head (thanks, Braun!  Long overdue)&lt;br /&gt;2. The 340S is much quieter&lt;br /&gt;3. The trimmer blades on the 340S are pointed away from the shaver which makes them much easier to use.  On the 5614, the trimmer blades and the shaver head both pointed in the same direction.  That means that when you used the trimmer, you had to be very careful because the shaver head was just a centimeter or two away from your sideburns, ear, lip, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;4. The three cutter heads of the 340S all move independently of each other.  This makes the razor very smooth to guide over the face, almost like using a shaving gel.  The 5614 used a pivoting head, but all three cutters on the head moved together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5614 still gave a great shave, but the 340S is quite an improvement over the earlier models.  In my opinion, the 380 is not worth the extra $40 or so because all you get is a cheap storage bag (definitely not worth $40) and the ability to lock the cutter heads.  I had that same feature on an earlier Braun model and never used it, so I&#x27;m not sure what value it adds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver barely irritates your skin and gives you no cuts unlike other electric shaver. Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to use primarily for trimming after home haircuts and  It does an excellent job of this.  I also occasionally use it for touch-up shaves when I am going out for the evening.</li>
    <li> I go through a shaver in 2 years and this is one of the best I have ever owned. A great shave!</li>
    <li> bought this to shave my head and avoid paying $10.00 for a barber to do the same. Got it from Target.com for 50 bucks. took it right out of the box and shaved my entire head and facial hair. worked like a champ. closer than any other electric razors I&#x27;ve had. I had a remington before. always wanted a Braun but could not afford one until I found Targets deal. rinses quickly and comes with a plastic cover for the head for travelling. outstanding razor. dont buy it in the stores unless its on sale but it online and save 30 - 40 bucks. after 3 more shaves it will have paid for itself.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Panasonic wet/dry shaver. I was tired of how expensive the replacement parts for the Panasonic were. This gives me a closer shave and, when it comes time to replace the blade assembly it&#x27;ll be less expensive. Should&#x27;ve gone with Braun to begin with!</li>
    <li> Charge last a long time satisfied with it</li>
    <li> great razor for the price...</li>
    <li> My husband loves it, shipped very quickly and well packaged. He tells me it is the best shaver he has ever had.</li>
    <li> BRAUN - good, Norelco - bad!</li>
    <li> The shave isn&#x27;t that close or smooth. I feel like I have to swing back by my house part way through a shift to reshave because I start getting a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow before I&#x27;m done with work</li>
    <li> I regularly purchase from Amazon. I am not a complainer. I have no idea how this razor works because it the attachments to charge the razor are so flimsy that I can&#x27;t get the razor charged. The electric charging cord is so cheap, so Chinese that one should be ashamed. It is supposedly a plug-in for their stand. It will not fit in and stay fit in. The razor topples over in the stand. This is basically a piece of junk</li>
    <li> Looks very cool, but not functioning as looks, maybe need more time to get used to it.</li>
    <li> Ships fast, exactly as described. Gives a very comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> delivered on time. I still need to go over some areas multiple times for a clean shave, but definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair. This does really well compared to shavers of the same design and price. I would however have a real razor as a back up as even the side clippers will fail to cut some of my chin hairs. This could easily be because of my think hair and i don&#x27;t foresee this happening to everyone. But if you have thick facial hair, i would highly recommend this shaver, but have a backup razor to get a few stray hairs on your chin. To be honest no other shaver i have had can get all but a few hairs on my face, so this is definitely a good shaver.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Super buy for the money. We&#x27;ll built shaver. It has met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have not been satisfied with electric razors, I had a Remington and Norelco before and this Braun is by far the best . Gives a close shave .The back and forth action of the blade is fast and strong ,thus far its holding a charge very well. Only time will tell if it continues to perform as good as it does out of the box but I do recommend it. The price I paid on Amazon was notably lower than my local stores (you know the big chains).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as a norelco I had paid less for previous. Still a decent shavers for the price.</li>
    <li> I am retired so I only shave once a week these days. So far this razor is everything advertised and gives me a comfortable and close shave. My last Braun was 14 years old and although it still works, it is beginning to fall apart. Local retail store has this same shaver for about $80 more that what I bought it at Amazon for!</li>
    <li> great shaver, lasts very long time. only draw back to me is the double head screen does not make it easy to shave in tight areas around your ears. but no real complaints, just wish it was the single screen.</li>
    <li> dose what it says on the box</li>
    <li> did not like it. Sent it back</li>
    <li> Great shave - Braun is a good product - price is right</li>
    <li> Great! Just what they promised.</li>
    <li> This new Braun Series 3 shaver EXCEEDED my expectations! My 10+ year old Braun Series 3 shaver served me well, but after replacing the cartridges 4 or 5 times, I decided it was time to &amp;#34;retire it&amp;#34;. This NEW version has several improvements, but what impresses me the most is the &amp;#34;Floating Heads&amp;#34; feature, that cuts my shaving time in half. And it comes as close to a blade shave as I have ever experienced. Another thing worth mentioning is the quiet operation of this shaver and its lack of vibration. It made me wonder if it was fully charged the first time I used it, but it definitely impressed me. Kudos to Braun! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Can shave pretty clean&lt;br /&gt;But the central blade is not so perfect smooth. So can feel a little bit irritated when dry shave</li>
    <li> After a few months of use, I like this shaver, it shaves parts of my face that I have never been able to get with a razor, or any other electric shaver. Battery life is good, works well in the shower, cleans up fast. Would definitely recommend this razor to a friend if asked :&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> This shaver worked better than expected. I was skeptical buying a less expensive razor. This goes up against the big boys.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought mine about one year ago.  Works very well and no complaints.  One of the most trouble free shavers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I got my husband this shaver for Christmas. It was the first electric razor that he had ever owned. The reviews seemed good enough, and the price was in the middle. Seemed like a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, he immediately told me that it just didn&#x27;t get very close. I googled and then grilled him - did you shower first to soften the hair? Are you oiling the blades? Yes and yes. I still didn&#x27;t believe him and assumed he was doing something wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, he went away for the weekend. Having some time to myself, I went to shave my legs. What, no razor blades??? After searching the house, pretty much all I came up with was his razor. I thought heck, why not.  I tried on dry legs... and it didn&#x27;t get very close.  I took a shower, got out, tried to shave my legs, and... it didn&#x27;t get very close.  Now, my hair is fine and blonde.  We&#x27;re not talking a hard task here. But definitely not close at all. After 5 minutes I gave up and nicked my way through a shave with the one awful single-blade disposable razor I&#x27;d found in the back of the closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, I think we must be doing something wrong. It does cut, just not close or well. If anyone has any advice, I&#x27;d love to hear it. I&#x27;m thinking about trying to beg Amazon for our money back, or at least some of it. This was a total flop.</li>
    <li> Worst Braun Shaver ever.</li>
    <li> Works great. I especially like how it works with shave cream.</li>
    <li> Gives you a decent, close shave if you spend enough time. Someone with sensitive skin may suffer irritation. I&#x27;ll be returning to a Norelco rotary when this wears out.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Meets all of my expectations.</li>
    <li> It misses a lot of hair under my chin. I use it either dry or with shaving cream. Tried in the shower and it pulled on my skin pretty bad. Otherwise works good.</li>
    <li> It is better than my last Braun 3 series</li>
    <li> Have used only a couple of times sense i got it. I have had hip an knee replacements and&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t bend to shave my legs and I saw this and thought try it out. So far it&#x27;s worked fine wet an dry.</li>
    <li> Up to now I had only used traditional shavers. Purchasing this unit have changed my life. It no longer is a problem to shave.</li>
    <li> I trusted the brand name e-shaver Braun, because I owned one more than 10 years. It is still working perfectly. This is the second I bought it. I use this one for my travel. This shaver does a good job on my face. I feel comfortably. The power is strong enough to remove beard. I give 5 stars for its satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Exceeding expectations. I shave for work everyday. Its cold and early I hate dull razors or expensive ones that dont last. This Braun is Superbly designed I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I suprised my husband with this for a Birthday present.  I was nervous because he has a beard &amp; wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work for his neck stuble but he is so very pleased.  He is able to use it daily &amp; it has a built in attachment to trim up his beard also.  He hasn&#x27;t used it wet yet but the dry works great.</li>
    <li> I can usually only shave with a blade. I try an electric razor about every 10 years just to see if they have evolved. I can not get a clean shave with any electric razor I have ever tried. If you can use and electric you would probably love this razor. It will cut a 4 day growth with no problem. I have never had an electric that can do that.</li>
    <li> I was VERY disappointing with this shaver. It doesn&#x27;t cut well, I go over my chin several times, and it still doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair. Don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a good job with under chin hair, so i have to repetitively roll over this area. Works well with wet and dry, light, easy to use, flexible, cheap. It&#x27;s fine, but a razor does a better job everytime.</li>
    <li> About as good a shave from an electric razor as one can get.</li>
    <li> After reading a number of reviews I chose this shaver for my 17 year old son, and couldn&#x27;t be happier so far. He&#x27;s had it a month now, using it daily, and has yet to need to recharge it! He tells me it&#x27;s giving him a quick and easy close, comfortable shave. His beard is still fairly light, so we can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s effectiveness on a super dark and heavy one. The head is supposed to last 18 months, so I&#x27;ll have to get back to you on that!</li>
    <li> very nice option to give relatives as a present. I love this brand. it is very suitable to our family.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this shaver.  I love that I can go 2 weeks between charges.  Love the great shave I get.  Bought this after my previous Series 3-380s died after 10 months and was gone for over 2 weeks in warranty repair/replacement.  Hope this one lasts longer!</li>
    <li> We got this for my husband for a Father&#x27;s Day present and he absolutely loves it!! Says it&#x27;s the best shaver he&#x27;s ever had! According to him it cut down his shaving time by half. I highly recommend this as a gift! It&#x27;s always nice when you hit a home run on a gift for dad :)</li>
    <li> Item worked for about 60 days and broke.  The power switch stopped working and does not turn off until the battery dies.</li>
    <li> This razor stopped working during shaving.  There was no indication of a low battery or needing charging.  It was recharged and operated a short time, not long enough to complete a shave.  I had  only used it about 30 days.  Probably a defective battery.  Mass produced products sometimes have defective components, that&#x27;s not the issue.  My frustration is the refusal to replace a defective product. The razor actually shaved fine, but the company not standing behind their product makes it unusable.</li>
    <li> Not very effective with growth beyond a day old.</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver, and so far I like it.</li>
    <li> Husband uses it at least once a day - sometimes twice. He like it a lot. This is the second one he&#x27;s had.</li>
    <li> good, i will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was a great find. My Husband uses it every day. I didn&#x27;t tell him how much I paid for this because he knows that in the past twenty years&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent way more money on his shavers. I&#x27;m pretty sure that this &#x27;&#x27;gem&#x27; probably in its day, cost a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. -Sometimes you do find more for your money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a month and I like it.  I have used a lower priced Braun (100 series) in combination with a Norelco Rotary Razor for years.  The Norelco did a much better job with longer whiskers that the Braun, but the Braun could give a closer shave.  The new Braun seems to replace the other two.  The battery life has been very good so far.  I only use the razor dry, so I cannot comment on using it wet.  It is a solid feeling razor that seems to be well made.  The three heads make shaving around my mouth and nose easier than the older model.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband had a 10 year old shaver and traded up to this one and was sorry he didn&#x27;t do it sooner. He is very happy with this model.</li>
    <li> Holds charge for about 9 days</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun 8000 series for years, and they are 3 times the cost of this shaver. The 3-340s is the best one so far. Shaving time under 2 minutes thanks to a really good foil. Minimal indicators and such. It flashes when it needs charging. Who needs all the digital indicators on the more expensive version. Very lightweight and good for travel. Good grip. Trimmer works great on the sideburns. Cleaning is easy, the foil pops off easily and can be gently tapped in the sink. All pros, no cons. For the price, this is an excellent shaver. I highly recommend it. You&#x27;ll be very pleased with no disappointments.  Update 9/23/16. Foil/cutter lasts for about 6 months assuming you shave every day or every other day. If you wait 3-4 days or longer, you&#x27;re in trouble. Have a Bic razor ready in that case. If you try to use these foil/cutters for more than 6 months you&#x27;ll spend 10 minutes going all over your face repeatedly, so expect to spend the $26-30 on a new foil/cutter in 6 months.</li>
    <li> Quiet and makes shaving easier.  I have had sveral Brauns over the years and they always perform well.  I also feel each new one is just improved a little bit more.</li>
    <li> Love it...great shaver for the price. Not as close as a blade, but 85-90% there, and great for not being irritating like a blade.</li>
    <li> I have used an older Braun 4775 for almost 6 years.  It never gave me a close shave in my \\&quot;trouble\\&quot; areas of jaw and neck.  I assumed the newer models would have improved on this shortfall.  I was wrong, this 3 Series does absolutely no better in those two areas.  Extremely disappointed in performance.  I read hundreds of reviews and thought this 3 Series might work.  If you need a close shave, you may want to consider other options, I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He&#x27;s had trouble in the past with having really bad razor burn. I did a lot of research and found that 1) the Braun brand is best for sensitive skin 2) foil razors are better than rotary for sensitive skin and 3) this is the 2nd best foil razor on Amazon. The price is amazing too. A lot of the other ones were too expensive...like 100+. His skin is so much softer after switching to this (he used to just use the normal cartridge razors). He also used to have red, itchy bumps down his neck but those are mostly gone now. The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t get s close a shave as the cartridge razors, but he said that he doesn&#x27;t mind if it means no razor burn. I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with it.  I like the ease of cleaning the foil and cutter.  Just remove it and hold it under warm water with a little presure and it gets perfectly clean.  Getting all the moisture out is another matter.  I found that after puting the head back on the body you can vigerously sshake the razor and pound it against the palm of your hand and all of the moisture will come out.  Try it.  Don Noettl</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver feels fine, and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation which is great. The battery lasts a pretty good amount of time, and the precision trimmer on the back works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not shave my neck well at all. I can shave my face with this, if I want to have a neck beard left over. I am not sure if it is my hair type or what, but this shaver always leaves hairs behind on my neck. This forces me to go back and touch up with my previous shaver (kind of defeats the purpose of the new one). For this reason I had to knock a few stars off.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver after a Remington rotary I had for awhile seemed to be wearing out. My main problem with it is that the foil design absolutely will not pick up certain areas on my face without going over repeatedly or going so far as to position hairs with my fingernails. Thicker hair that grows straight out is no contest and this shaver handles it very well, but any thinner/softer hairs that tend to try to grow parallel to my face or quickly curl over just cannot be picked up by this shaver very easily. They won&#x27;t poke into the holes in the foils on their own, and nothing about the head design makes it easy to encourage these hairs to stand up so they can be cut by the coarse center blade or the foils. My old rotary did not shave as close, but it at least did an 80% job on my face consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short version: if you have thick/stick-straight-out facial hair, this style razor will work great. If you are more of an Eric Foreman/whispy-whisker face in any major area this thing will be a real pain in the butt to use compared to a rotary.</li>
    <li> Very  very smooth shave. If you are considering purchasing this shaver get it! Shave lasts full 16 hours.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect gift for my husband.  It&#x27;s easy to pack for travel and very easy handling when shaving.</li>
    <li> In order for this product to work well, you need to be a specific type of man. It became clear after my first use that the product was not designed for men with thicker facial hair nor men with moderately sensitive skin. This product left a very uneven patchy shave, so I thought an easy way to get around this flaw is to simply go over my face several times. By doing this, my face (neck in particular) was more cut up than ever before while using a conventional razor blade. The only reason it earns 2 stars is for design and battery life. If you have a thin pubescent beard with thick skin, this product is for you; otherwise, I recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I am frustrated after purchasing this device. After shaving, I still have to use a regular razor since I look as if I hadn&#x27;t shaved at all.</li>
    <li> ₤ for ₤ and $ for $ best straight edge shave available.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3 (mine is model 340-s) is my best electric ever, better than previous winner, Brand-N rotary.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it dry so far.  I had to use the rotary wet to get as close.&lt;br /&gt;Very non-irritating as well. Some apparent mercy in the planned obsolescence department, i.e., timed foil head replacement (a plus).&lt;br /&gt;Lame trimmer, as always. I bought a separate AA battery powered trimmer and don&#x27;t bother with electric shaver \\&quot;trimmers\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> it is very good!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a 3-series Braun I purchased in 2008.  In the five years since the last version of the 3-series, Braun has obviously made some improvements to the shaving head.  This new shaver is so quiet and smooth running, and the resulting shave is the closest I&#x27;ve gotten with an electric shaver ever. I like that the sideburn/moustache trimmer is perpendicular to your face so you can hold the shaver vertically when doing touchups. (unlike the previous version)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE----I&#x27;ve been using this razor daily since the end of March and today is the first day it needs to be recharged.  So after the initial charge, the battery lasted about a month and a half.  Very good battery.</li>
    <li> I like it and I am using it wet only, with shaving cream applied to my face. I try first time, just dry and didn&#x27;t like it very much but wet shave makes me believe this is excellent shaver for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t try yet the replacement head. No comment.</li>
    <li> This is a ggod shaver. I like this one. My trimming gets better</li>
    <li> shaving is clean ＆ 我想用中文</li>
    <li> So far it does the job! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want to give 100 points&lt;br /&gt;Good seller !!</li>
    <li> SO FAR, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS RAZOR.  EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED.  REAL TEST IS HOW LONG IT SHAVES AS GREAT AS THE FIRST MONTH OF USE.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST reason I have ever used. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item and have never written a bad review for amazon, but this was a waste of over $100.00.  One of the screens was defective and cut my face up.  I ordered the recommended screen replacement that was listed to buy and paid extra for 1-day shipping in order to take the shaver on business travel, when the screen came, it was the wrong screen replacement, it does not fit the razor.  Braun razors are one of the best, but this was the worst experience that I have had on amazon.  I am out over $100.00 and have to purchase another razor some where else.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 in 2 yrs. Mustache and beard trimmer did not last a month. Called braun no response.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY !!!!</li>
    <li> Works great for my boyfriend a great buy on BlackFriday deal if you need one please pick this up as it will be a great buy and a good quality product.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and loved the price.  I have been using it now for over 2 months and I am very happy with the shave:  close and comfortable.  The big difference from my 8 year old former Braun shaver?  QUIET!!!  Love that it purrs like a kitten.  Only complaint is that it only works off the battery, and not when plugged in.  But a quick charge for a shave is completed in 5 minutes, and the battery level sensor (green blinking light, red blinking light) lets you know when the battery needs to be charged.  So happy that I bought one for my teenage son.  He is equally as happy as I am with the shaver.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVER.....LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver, so I don&#x27;t have too much reference. However I can say that it works fine but some bristles neck in my neck always stay there. It means that it cannot reach and I need to use a blade to have a good finishing.</li>
    <li> No need to spend more on a shaver. It does the job.... efficient and comfortable.  It might take a few extra passes on your neck compared to your face, but the shave is smooth as it gets.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. I was a bit worried that the shave would not be that close but that is not the case. I consider myself to be a shaving expert when it comes to a razor and the brawn is an equal match. I feel that my skin is just as smooth with the braun if not smoother. Plus it is so easy to use with no skin irritation at all. Great product great price.</li>
    <li> After years of struggling with razor burn and ingrown hairs while using a cartridge razor I decided I needed something new. I switched to a DE razor, badger brush, and a tub of nice shaving cream. After getting my technique down things were a lot better than the cartridge but I was still getting red bumps around my lower neck. I didn&#x27;t want to give up my wet shave so I bought this electric shaver and I LOVE it.  I still get to use my nice smelling shaving cream and the shave is close to that of the DE razor with a ATG final pass and equally as close a two WTG passes but with NO irritation! That&#x27;s a win in my book.</li>
    <li> I have not had an electric razor since I was a teenager (I am now 82 years old) and since I am now on blood  thinners I had to get one.  I read the reviews on Amazon (where I do most of my shopping) and decided on this razor.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  It does an excellent job and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Looks like a well-made product. Hope I can use it for a few years</li>
    <li> Works fine. Cuts evenly, per my husband.</li>
    <li> excellent shaver. Good or OK  price.</li>
    <li> I would not go on a date, after shaving with it.</li>
    <li> Wow! Been using foil shaver for 20 years, wish I had tried Braun first. Awesome shaver. Much more comfortable, faster and closer shave.</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all, can not fully remove all the stubble from my neck, still have to use my Gillette Fusion to finish the job</li>
    <li> Awesome, holds charge well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Braun user for 30+ years and was always satisfied with their entry-level models.  This year, I treated myself to a Braun 720 to see what I&#x27;ve been missing.  After using it for 6 months, I bought a Braun 340s and am much happier with that model.  Here&#x27;s why:  Shaving:  I think Braun optimized the 720 for comfort, but went too far.  The shaver head is sprung so soft that it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting the blades next to your skin to cut your beard.  I had to go over and over my face to get a complete shave and was still left with stubble that I could feel no matter how long I shaved or which angle I used.  The shaver head in the 340s is sprung much firmer.  The result is fewer passes, less time shaving and a noticeably closer and smoother shave.  Trimmer:  The trimmer on the 720 is just plain terrible.  It folds out from the side of the body at an odd angle, sticks out a couple of wobbly inches and has a curved blade (like a letter &amp;#34;D&amp;#34;, with the curve sticking out).  What part of a man&#x27;s face curves inward in a way that will fit that shape?  Heads are round, not shaped like an hourglass!  The curve means that only the middle half-inch of the trimmer does anything and the weird angle and length mean that it is hard to position to get a clean, straight trim.  The trimmer on the 340s, on the other hand, is straight so the whole width can be used and it slides straight up from the side of the body to be close and level with the shaver head, so you know exactly how the trimmer blade is aligned without even looking at it.  The result is straight, even sideburns with one pass.  Longer hair:  I have a short goatee and the 720 shaver head was always snagging my beard (ouch!) when shaving up to the edge of it.  I don&#x27;t have this problem with the 340s.  3 speeds v. 1 speed:  The 3 speeds on the 720 didn&#x27;t have any noticeable effect other than to change the sound of the shaver.  The single speed on the 340s works just fine.  So, for me, the 340s is the better shaver on performance and ease of use.  The cost saving compared to the 7 Series is just icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, but it came wrong name.</li>
    <li> Borderline in producing good shave, also occasionally pulls on some chin hair.</li>
    <li> The razor doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.  Gave to my 16 year old twin boys who I think will be able to use.  Kept my remmington that shaves a lot closer.</li>
    <li> I hate to knock off a star here, because this truly is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from any electric shaver.  I have a very thick beard, and more than one electric razor has had to go back because it took too long to shave, or simply couldn&#x27;t handle the shave at all.  This one provides the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had (electric, that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it loses a star because it can&#x27;t be used &amp;#34;plugged in.&amp;#34; It will shave after a five minute quick charge, but if the battery dies, you can&#x27;t just plug it in and fire it up.  If you plug it in, the power button does nothing until you unplug the charge cord from the razor. Frankly, this would have been a deal breaker for me if it had been clear before I ordered. Once I had the shaver here, it wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back for an upgrade, because the shave was so good--but I want people to be aware of this!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, reminds me of why Braun is the best, and why foil shavers works so much better for me than rotary shavers. I am heavy bearded and rotary shavers just don&#x27;t do the job...</li>
    <li> I guess the NFL has a bunch of players with half shaven faces because this thing is a piece of crap.  No matter whether I tried as a wet shave or a dry shave, it would not get all the hair.  After 30 minutes of trying I finally had to finish the half-complete job with my wet razor.  I will try using it a few more times to manage a short beard, otherwise I think it will be going back.</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed.  Read quite a number of reviews before replacing my 10+ year old Norelco Rotary (cord model) with the Braun 340.  Though it seems pretty well built and fit in my hand nicely, it took forever to shave (talking 15 minutes or more) and then I usually finished it off with my old shaver to catch hair under my chin the Braun missed.  I tried dry shave, used Lectric shave, wet shave in shower, wet shave with Gel cream...none were comparable to my old shaver.  Sent it back for refund and will use proceeds to buy some new shaver heads for my old Norelco...see if I can get another 10 years.</li>
    <li> A great shaver.  I use it every day with a great shave and no problems. Got to go now.  bye</li>
    <li> Love this shaver. Use it for shaving my legs and I always get a close shave. Holds charge for a long time too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who gave it a good couple of tries before we returned it.  He said it didn&#x27;t lift the hair on his face as well as the rotating trimmers.</li>
    <li> Does not shave as smooth as expected but works well in the shower and battery lasts really long. find myself still having to use my Gillette shaving sticks for that smooth finish</li>
    <li> I had an old Braun shaver about 10 years old. This is so much better. It makes a very close shave as good as a blade. It does not need a docking station which was important to me. All in all a great little shaver.</li>
    <li> I have had three electric shavers, one by Remington, one by Norelco and this new Braun Series 3.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the latter two in hopes of finding a better shaver than the Remington. The results are that neither the Norelco or the Braun Series&lt;br /&gt;3 gives me as close a shave as the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;I have chosen to continue to use the Remington instead of the Norelco and Braun Series 3 even though the on off button on the&lt;br /&gt;Remington has lost its rubber cover, and I have had to replace the cutters and foils about every six months.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Series 3 claims that their cutters last for 18 months. I don&#x27;t see much benefit to that if the shave is suboptimal.</li>
    <li> not as close a shave as anticipated</li>
    <li> Battery life on this is TERRIBLE. Bought this for travel use but I&#x27;m returning it because I would have to charge it after every use. Before the end of one shave, the battery light is already blinking even though it is fully charged at the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it didn&#x27;t give a close shave. It feel felt stubbly after a thorough shave. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a razor close shave but definitely was expecting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice build and decent quality overall but the poor battery life kills it for me. I have bought razors have the price of this one that are better quality, closer shave, and I only have to charge once a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning this and would not recommend. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Close, smooth &amp; comfortable shave. Cuts hair close to skin without irritation. I had a older series 1 Braun (I liked) and the battery was staying full for only a few shavers. Time for a new shaver. Glad I picked the series 3. I have another Braun Cruzer 5 hair cutter and owned other  Braun&#x27;s—all dependable.</li>
    <li> I have minimal facial hair, I thought this would be a slam dunk.  I am very disappointed it just doesn&#x27;t give a clean shave.  Not even close.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver. A little big expensive but the quality is good.  Very easy to shave, u don&#x27;t need any cream.  And the battery also last longer than others.</li>
    <li> Good shaver, doesn&#x27;t get as close as I like but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 23 year old grandson. He doesn&#x27;t have very heavy growth and I saw this has good reviews. He tried it as soon as it arrived. He came out very clean shaved. He said the shaver part didn&#x27;t shave at all, but he was able to shave his face with the pop up trimmer. I am returning it because the foil shaver did nothing. I will be getting him a new rotary shaver because that kind does give him a good shave. This does nothing, and it&#x27;s not worth the price for him to shave his entire face with the pop up trimmer.</li>
    <li> Hi, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and glad I received them on time, but a little sad because I added a massage card for each item and never received it.</li>
    <li> Excelent! Much better than I thought, was afraid to buy and disappoint me, but it was well above my expectations. The shaving is very close, razor, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> nice tractor m child loved it.</li>
    <li> Its a straight forward, last minute need to shave and no water source, shaver. I am in the Army and they hate when you use electrics because they often don&#x27;t do a good job. This one gets me by without catching any comments on it. It&#x27;s not amazing and some days it refuses to catch those hairs in the corner of my jaw line but i flip it over and hit em with the detail trimmer and they get short enough to go unnoticed. I&#x27;m wary of spending more on, say, a $100 model but this one does good for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Works well for quick shave on my face, but not well on my neck. I have no problem using a blade for my neck every other day, so overall I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband s birthday and he loves it! It gives a very close, but not uncomfortably close, shave.</li>
    <li> Shaver was delivered fast (less then 2 days!). It seems to be of good quality and provides me with a very good shave everytime. One thing I wish for is a travel case which used to be included for my previous purchases of Braun shavers (5 to 10 years ago). These shavers usually lasted me 4 to 5 years with regular cleaning and foil/blade changes every 12 to 18 months.</li>
    <li> My first time using this machine in a wet shave and I like it!.</li>
    <li> Lower quality plastic parts than the similarly priced unit I purchased 5 years ago. Functionally though, all works as designed and shaves with no irritation. The larger double head is difficult to trim close to beard.</li>
    <li> I think this shaver deserves a good review. I got a fancy Norelco before and I had to pass it on the same spot at least 5 times before getting a decent shave, this one, costs half the Norelco and does its job perfectly.</li>
    <li> Searched for a few hours for a good shaver for reasonable price and got this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quickest and closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had hands down, seriously! no irritation at all (and I&#x27;m very picky about it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life and easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try before spending $100 in other shavers around....</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself few weeks ago, it&#x27;s an ok shaver for the price. The beard trimmer on back does a better job then the main blades. I keep this in my car for times when I&#x27;m running late in the morning.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver with shaving gel today and I was amazed that it shaved me as close as my Gillette Mach 3 razor.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about being cut in those places on my face that are hard to shave.  I can press hard and get those tough whiskers.  Since it is cleaned using water, it is very easy to clean and put back on the charging stand.</li>
    <li> Main thing I bought this for was the use in the shower.  Works fine but not a great shave.  Was worth the price</li>
    <li> After over 20 years, it was time for a new razor.  I stayed with a Braun, because of the incredible life my previous one had.</li>
    <li> It works well and holds a charge for numerous shaves.</li>
    <li> My two main problems with razors is I tend to let my beard grow for a few days before shaving (not long enough to warrant the beard trimmer) and my neck is difficult to shave.  I was hoping the &#x27;integrated middle trimmer&#x27; would help with this.  The first time I used the shaver things did not go so well.  The foil parts were ripping my hair out as the middle thing simultaneously assaulted my skin but I persevered, determined to finish, eventually getting it done.  On the plus side, it has trained me to never let my hair grow too long lest I have to face the wrath of this meat grinder again.  Using it with shorter facial hair eliminates the ripping, but not the sawing from that middle thing.  The long hair trimmer is average.  I am thankful for the money back guarantee and hope it goes more smoothly than my shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, this is a great gift for someone you hate who also lets their facial hair grow out for a few days before shaving</li>
    <li> Compared to other brands I have tried Braun shavers are just better in all aspects. They are well designed and well built. They feel sturdy, fit correctly in your hand and everything is in the right place. They also last a long time. So decide which model you want plus the bells and whistles you need/want to pay extra for get that one.  The 340S works perfectly and can be washed under the tap.</li>
    <li> It shaves very clean, especially with shaving cream. Waterproof, washable, what&#x27;s not to love? This is my third Braun is twenty years and I only replaced my last one because a new head for it was half the price of this shaver, so I said, &amp;#34;Why not? This one is waterproof, after all.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s how easy it was to convince myself that I wanted another Braun.</li>
    <li> This is little more than a Bic razor. It vibrates a lot but has no moving blades. it just has a fixed blade that scrapes along your skin. Sad because Braun use to mean good. I don&#x27;t find this a very good razor. Not at the price i paid.</li>
    <li> Very good product, I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth shave for hubby.  And occasionally  myself before I bought my own electric  razor</li>
    <li> Great product and brand, although person for whom this was purchased went back to his &#x27;old&#x27; shaver, says this type doesn&#x27;t do the job. (Prefers rotary blades)</li>
    <li> Took too long and too much pressure to trim beard evenly. Wasn&#x27;t worth a damn on the head, because foil clogged with hairs and skin when it got wet. I guess you can&#x27;t beat a razor. Amazon sent ups to pick it up.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, doesn&#x27;t pinch and provides a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Gives a good close shave.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a better shaver ,but is not what I expected similar to my Philco. Not big deal.</li>
    <li> It does not shave as well as I expected, I like to return it if I can .</li>
    <li> this is my first dry shave. It definitely has problems around the contours. I primarily use it for week ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Still learning to use it :-)</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;it holds a charge for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;misses at least 1/3 of whiskers after the first few passes, even with repeated attempts at slightly different angles requires touchups with a real razor&lt;br /&gt;i still end up with razor burn, either from this thing or the real razor i have to bring in to finish the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s about it.  pretty much a waste of money. :-/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 2 months now and it had been great. After a conditioning the battery by purposefully draining it a few times I decided to see how long a full charge would last. It was 4 weeks before it told me it had low battery &amp; I kept infringing it on low battery for a few more days!&lt;br /&gt;I generally shave dry, so I can&#x27;t comment much about the wet shave, but I do love that I can just rinse the razor in water when I&#x27;m done. Also, my old, dry-only, razor would destroy my face if it was sweaty or the air was too humid; this works great in a steamy bathroom &amp; when my face is sweaty. I highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> Love this shaver!  I shave regularly with a blade razor but this shaver is great for quick shaves without preparation needed for blade shaving. It gives a relatively smooth shave and being able to use it in the shower as well as cleaning it with warm water is a great convenience.  I hardily recommend this product!</li>
    <li> So far, great.  I get a nice shave, seems to be well constructed (my Remington trimmer broke).  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good close shave.  Not as noisy as my Panasonic. Good buy!</li>
    <li> This is the worst shaver I have ever owned.  What it does is make noise, what it doesn&#x27;t do is effectively shave a face.  You have to go over your beard at least 5 or 6 times to even begin to get a cut.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who is over 15 years of age with an adult beard.  As a first shaver, for peachfuzz, it just might work.  German engineering, hummmmm....</li>
    <li> this is for my teenager who did not want to use razor and he loves it</li>
    <li> Gives a close and comfortable shave, nearly as good as the safety razor wet shave I usually use. Much better than the electric shaver I had as a teenager, so I guess the technology has improved recently which is good. Anyway, this is definitely worth a second look, even if in the past you thought you didn&#x27;t like electric shaving anymore. Plus, as always with electric, it&#x27;s quicker which is nice.</li>
    <li> Have used this for the past two years. Recently got a replacement blade. Was surprised how pricey it was and I was not totally happy with the blade. For the price of this shaver you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I could not get a close shave in the chin area</li>
    <li> Convenient wet/dry use, easy to charge, quick charging</li>
    <li> about 14 days,a little slow.but I like it.it&#x27;s a good gift.</li>
    <li> So far best shaver I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> So far so good but time will tell</li>
    <li> Got it for my husband - does a really nice job.</li>
    <li> Works great, close shave &amp; easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have sensitive skin (get ingrown hairs and bumps with regular razors). I have also &amp;#34;buzzed&amp;#34; my head since I was 19 (I&#x27;m now 35). I&#x27;ve tried several different shavers over the years (albeit much cheaper ones) and have always had problems (shave not close enough, irritating, unit breaking, etc). I&#x27;m not sure how &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; is considered a close shave, but this one leaves my skin very smooth (feels just as smooth as when I shaved with a razor to me, but without the razor burn or ingrown hairs). The charging station works well; just sits charging next to my sink until I use it. I can also shave a lot faster with this thing. The little &amp;#34;clipper thing&amp;#34; between the foils is pretty cool since it will chop off longer hair before the foils cut down to skin level. I&#x27;ve been using this thing for one month now and wish I had bought something like this when I first started shaving (would have saved me a lot of time and grief over the years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, for those that shave their heads, this thing works great (for me anyway). I get a smooth shave, just like on my face (facial hairs are a lot thicker so I would it expect it to work well on my head). If I&#x27;m lazy and let my hair grow out too much (face or head), I run a buzzer over my face/head first before using this shaver.</li>
    <li> Birthday Gift, was very much appreciated and cared for.  Guess I bound the right one.</li>
    <li> My panasonic wet/dry shaver died and decided to give this one a try. So far it does its job. Performs well with shaving cream, and easy to clean under running water. I have not regretted this purchase.</li>
    <li> good seller. recommended</li>
    <li> i got it for 39.99 dollors, a very good price. i wish it could get the price  soon, then i will get  another  one  for my friend.</li>
    <li> Works great and cuts close for smooth results.  Solid feel and weight.  Great shaver for price.</li>
    <li> My last electric shaver was 55 years ago. This shaver works great. It shaves close and was easy on my 72 year old face. Its noise level is lower than I expected. The packaging was excellent. I was expecting the product packaging to be hard to open because of the reviews I read before ordering, Braun has change to a two piece plastic package for the shaver that pulls apart, no cutting required. What more can I say get it. Its a excellent shaver.</li>
    <li> i want to give this to my father as a gift</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to hold it and  use it.</li>
    <li> This is my first time to buy Braun products.  It&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> The Braun 340S-4 does a poorer job (less close) than my 12 year old Norelco.</li>
    <li> Good razor, believe Braun, the next will buy</li>
    <li> I have not tried it wet. best electric shaver I have tried in years.</li>
    <li> Best foil razor ever, right from the first use!!!</li>
    <li> Ready to use out of the box. Smooth powerful motor. I have been using electric shavers for 12yrs and this shaver has far Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> My daddy said this shaver was great!!</li>
    <li> Buy it for my boyfriend and he like it.</li>
    <li> i love it ,is very nice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth every  cent. It&#x27;s really good. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated. I shave dry every other day. no complaints from me. Love it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed my first Braun so when it died I bought another. That one I did not like so when it died I was reluctant to buy another Braun. Decided to give them one more try and with this one I am very pleased. Just the right size and does the job. Charger last a long time as well.</li>
    <li> Major problem with charging as he cord does not connect securely.  Otherwise shaves well.</li>
    <li> I read lots of reviews before buying, my Husband really likes it.</li>
    <li> Hubby needed a new razor and he loves this style and brand!</li>
    <li> Handy shaver, close shaver, and the batteries last a week between full recharges.  Recharge time is brief...and again, a shave you&#x27;ll like!</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaver, but I liked more old Remington a little more.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband...who can&#x27;t stop using it. Does he really have that many whiskers?&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s happy - so I&#x27;m happy. Great on a budget when razor blades are sooooo expensive.</li>
    <li> love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged it to use</li>
    <li> My husband had me return it.</li>
    <li> My husband says it&#x27;s better than any electric razor he has ever had.</li>
    <li> I purchased the [[ASIN:B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]] from Amazon about a month ago. I am getting older and my old Braun dry shave was to abrasive on my skin. The new one is really smooth shaving but it seems to take about the time to get the job done, I use a shaving gel, and I thought it would be faster. To date the battery seems to last a little longer and doesn&#x27;t take to long to charge and the trimmer works real good. I thought with a wet shave it would take less time to shave but that isn&#x27;t the case just easier on the skin.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for anyone with medium beard thickness. Battery lasts for a long time. Easy to clean as it can get wet, and works very well with shaving creams.&lt;br /&gt;My only complain is that it takes some time (at least for me) to get a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; shave, mostly because of how hard it is to get all the hair in the neck area all at once.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s working very well, and I would recommend it no doubt due to its price tag.</li>
    <li> My husband is a stroke survivor and I help him with shaving. This is by far the best shaver we have ever had! It shaves closer, is easier to clean, and it is so quick to use! Could not be happier!!!</li>
    <li> Electric razor was a replacement for  a tired, but very good old Braun.  Exceeding expectations.  Smooth shave, easy use.  Considered a more expensive model with all the bells and whistles, but settled on the more basic model.  Glad I did - not only considering cost, but all the premiums features would have just gathered dust.</li>
    <li> Braum makes good shavers, I have had three over the past ten years I keep coming back as they provide a nice clean shave. I don&#x27;t replace parts only the total shaver because it&#x27;s easier.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Great battery life, power and above all the cleanest shave ever. Thanks. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very light weight. Close shaved. But runs off of battery only, does not run off of AC cord. But charges quickly, should it run down while shaving.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! Would reccomend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great and worth the price. Works even better in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. My husband loves it. He recommends it. The price was also pretty good. I even got a $5.00 coupon from Amaon.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t forget to order a new head after 18 months.  Makes a difference.  I don&#x27;t use this daily.  But when I do it does the trick.</li>
    <li> This is great quality and much better than a female razor - better product and worth every cent.  I wouldn&#x27;t ever buy a women&#x27;s razor again.</li>
    <li> Works great, Exactly as it detailed. Great in and out of water. I would reccommnend this braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver to all.</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun man for years.  My old Braun has been with me for at least  years and still works except the heads are to worn to get a close shave.  So I had really high expectations for the new and improved razor.  I have to say I was a little disappointed.  I expected as a close as a shave as my last Braun gave when it was new. Didn&#x27;t happen.  I expected a close shave when in the shower with shaving cream.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell the razor was cutting at all.&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand is nice, but a little hard to get the razor to set in the cradle.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t hold the razor at the exact right angle it won&#x27;t cut.  And be prepared tp use your free hand to stretch your face to get that really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;The produce doesn&#x27;t suck, but I wish I had spent the money and replaced the heads on my old razor.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve had in years.  Cuts all my whiskers for a good, clean shave.  I&#x27;d not hesitate to recommend&lt;br /&gt;to anyone!</li>
    <li> My husband is so happy with this shaver. Is the best shaver ever. That&#x27;s he says😄</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas and he&#x27;s used it everyday since.  The battery keeps a charge for a long time and he gets a good shave with it.  He says it the best shaver he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> Gives fast and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Best Low Cost Electric Shaver So Far for Me.&lt;br /&gt;I currently have a Panasonic and recently had a Remington (until the foil cover broke) so I decided to go with the Braun, since it was under $50.  Although the Panasonic motor seems faster/stronger, I am getting a better shave with this Braun, with less passes.  So, although the Panasonic is a good shaver, I am constantly choosing the use this Braun over it.</li>
    <li> My son loved it !! Now my husband and my son-in-law want one too !!</li>
    <li> Very good shaver. i have used Braun shaver s for many years and this one continues the tradition. thank you,</li>
    <li> Delivery was very prompt.  However, I found the razor cuts only average with my medium density beard causing me to go over some areas of my beard several times..  The trimmer is OK but I find difficult to use as the barrel of the razor is very thick and wide... even with my above size hands.  Being new,, the battery charge lasts a good time, happy with that feature..  My unit did NOT come with a case which I regret... it was not indicated on the Amazon  ad.... I would have paid an extra $10 for a case..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line if I had the chance to hold the unit in my hands I would NOT have purchased such a thick size razor.... the other features I can live with....  I opted not to return the razor and live with the thick but uncomfortable barrel of the razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert S.</li>
    <li> arrived fast and works great thanks</li>
    <li> This razor has done an awesome job thus far. I love the wet/dry capabilities and get a much closer, smoother shave when using it with shave gel/cream. It&#x27;s been everything I had hoped for when purchasing.</li>
    <li> This works terribly, and I wont recommended it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, but my husband has used it the last few days and he seems to enjoy it. Gets a close shave and works well.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Gives a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> does not cut close shave, particularly in the neck region</li>
    <li> Great shaver. It is what it is. You can depend on getting what you paid for with Baun. It works, just like the ad states.I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I bought two from this machine, one for me and the other for my father.&lt;br /&gt;We are really happy until now with it.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it for all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had four Brauns, all good.  This is the best.  That&#x27;s all I have to say.  That&#x27;s all I have.</li>
    <li> a gift for boyfriend, and he likes it</li>
    <li> I have had several Braun shavers and this one definitely seems to shave better.  You don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot over and over like you did with the old one&#x27;s.  It feel&#x27;s a little more plasticky than my old Brauns and the trimmer seems a little cheesy.  Mine came with a cord, charging base and instruction manual.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas over a year ago and he still uses it daily.  I can&#x27;t speak for the comfort but he seems to like it.  We also use the trimmer for the back of his neck every once in a while...</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t shave at all...create mess..redness...had to use manual shaver again..</li>
    <li> I would say its like a razor, but without the risk of an accident and 0 skin irritation</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, curly hair which grows in all directions. This is not the razor for you, my friends, if your case is the same as mine. I&#x27;ve gone over the same areas at different angles several times only to never get what shouldve been simple cuts. Go for a more expensive Braun like the 7 series.</li>
    <li> Performance is awesome.  My only question is how long the cutting blades will remain sharp?</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver for not a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;Yes: it takes time to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34;, but then it gives excellent shaves with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Yes: it can be used wet or dry and can be rinsed out if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Yes: it has a decent sized trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Yes: it has decent battery life.&lt;br /&gt;I got this to replace an older Remington that had become less than comfortable to use.  At first I wondered about the shaver, since I really had to work to get all my beard off.  After a couple of days it settled in and now its faster shaving than the Remington.  It has two screen-heads and set between them is an older style cutter head for beard hair too long for the screens to handle.  It comes with a stand, charger, and battery light.  It also has a head replacement light: when it turns on its time to replace the shave head.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good razor and it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  My previous shaver lasted me twelve years.  I think this one may last longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of shaves,I find it does a great job on my light beard. So I can only go by my own use. I also like the side burn pop up trimmer. It&#x27;s well made, took out the 2 yr warranty with it, for under $5, why not.</li>
    <li> I have had it for over a year and still working really good.  we still don&#x27;t need to change any parts yet.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my cheapo norelco and what an improvement. This makes shaving bearable again. No more razor burn spots or lots of missed whiskers. I even went back to shave cream and throw away razors but what a drag. I hate shaving so I only shave about every 2 or 3 days. I don&#x27;t use preshave lotion. I just shave and then take my shower afterwards. This Braun shaver seems well made and is nicely packaged. It is a very good deal for $49 compared to the other options. I have not used it with shave cream and I won&#x27;t either. It sells for $79 at the big blue chain store so Amazon has it for a bargain right now. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have purchase at least 3 Shavers for my husband the last few years. None has made him as happy as the&lt;br /&gt;Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver.  He said it gives him an even closer shave than a stick razor, never&lt;br /&gt;burns his skin and I think he looks cute as can be :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Pamela Danielsen</li>
    <li> This razor gives me a very close shave. It stays charged a long time.</li>
