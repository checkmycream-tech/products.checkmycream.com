      <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I guess I can&#x27;t expect much more when opting to buy a perfume that has been discontinued.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t think of a better way to shop for a gift.</li>
      <li>I wonder how many ppl who wear it receive compliments from strangers.</li>
      <li>Love this purchase</li>
      <li>This scent is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Outstanding.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, and so does my husband, so it works for me.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>What more need be said?</li>
      <li>love this perfume, always purchase it from amazon..</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the scent when I found an advertising swatch inside a magazine.  </li>
      <li>Nice clean smell, not over powering like most scents on the market.</li>
      <li>--it&#x27;s nice a fresh smelling</li>
      <li>but my order was processed very quickly even with the holiday season pressure.     </li>
      <li>Not too strong but noticeable.  </li>
      <li>this perfume was her signature scent, I am so happy we found it and for such a fabulous price.</li>
      <li>It might be too light for some.</li>
      <li>Recommend to anyone who likes light floral scents.</li>
      <li>For a daily scent, I use Tracy Ellen perfume which you can get from Amazon for a great price or at TJ Maxx.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Pure\\&quot; was recommended as a fragrance so light, it can be worn by people who suffer migraines.  </li>
      <li>This \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; smells like a cheap, cheap lab chemical.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Pure\\&quot; describes the perfume notes perfectly, lasts a pretty long time.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean and light scented.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who likes a light and floral clean scent.</li>
      <li>My husband went wild with the smell because it is very appealing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, and suitable for anytime wear, and has decent longevity.</li>
      <li>When I wore Pure, I got many compliments &amp; was often asked what it was.  </li>
      <li>I prefer a light, clean, fresh scent,</li>
      <li>this smells so fresh, free, and</li>
      <li>It is clean and fresh without being over powering.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is simple, elegant and light.... like the scent!  </li>
      <li>Excdellent product and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
      <li>As noted by other reviewers, Pure isn&#x27;t easy to find, especially at such a reasonable price -- and thank goodness for Prime shipping options!&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I -- and more importantly -- my wife think this is a lovely, nearly unique, but not overpowering fragrance good for wearing anytime.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had MANY compliments from complete strangers over the years.</li>
      <li>Pur (no e) -- and was pleasantly surprised how much she liked it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if, like me, you don&#x27;t like hit-you-over-the-head, strong florals.</li>
      <li>Just a little goes a long way but leaves a light, beautiful scent!</li>
      <li>It fits just right with no problems at all.</li>
      <li>I am sure any woman (and her better or lesser half) would love this perfume.</li>
      <li>The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last but it is fine for the price!</li>
      <li>first bought it for my wife 5 or 6 years ago -- for some reason</li>
      <li>Take into account that if you buy this, it probably won&#x27;t be just as you expect, if you are a Pure lover, as the perfume has probably been sitting around awhile.</li>
      <li>This fragrance was given to me as a gift, because the gifters could no longer find \\&quot;Pure</li>
      <li>I really like this perfume.</li>
      <li>My very favourite perfume....</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like anything heavy &amp; musky, but I also don&#x27;t want to smell like a rose garden.  </li>
      <li>I switch off between this, and my other favorite perfume, L&#x27;Eau De Issey by Issey Miyake.  </li>
      <li>I oredered this product strictly based on the review&#x27;s on Amazon.com, like most other things I buy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This has to be where Marc Jacobs got inspiration for Daisy because that is what it smells like but less potent.</li>
      <li>I call it a classic fragrance.</li>
      <li>not an original scent, and in fact, no real scent at all), but, even the pure alcohol smell (thankfully..sorta) didnt last more than ten minutes.</li>
      <li>but the price was too high.</li>
      <li>&#x27;Pure,&#x27; has a floraly scent and somewhat reminds me of the old &#x27;Exclaimation&#x27; perfume.</li>
      <li>Buy the 3.7 oz, it will definitely last for a long time; just spray lightly!</li>
      <li>I would be VERY surprised if this happens.</li>
      <li>I checked my usual internet sources for more.</li>
      <li>I find it a little bit on the boring side, but its good for those times when one of my more &#x27;interesting&#x27; fragrances would be too much.</li>
      <li>I bought this product expecting it to be a new and refreshing scent that lasted (at least) through the morning/afternoon.</li>
      <li>The reminiscent scent of Pure is there, but with a sourness to it.</li>
      <li>Amazon is the only place I have found Pure by Alfred Sung.</li>
      <li>Not only does this perfume smell like pure alcohol (ie.</li>
      <li>Some call it an old perfume.</li>
      <li>soft and alluring.  </li>
      <li>Moment\\&quot; and (reasonably) thought that \\&quot;Pure\\&quot; would be similar.</li>
      <li>Pure was the only fragrance I would wear several years ago.  </li>
      <li>I would literally spray it on each day (hoping that maybe there would be scent that was just delayed in coming from the bottle somehow) and within five minutes, I would smell absolutely nothing (nothing good and nothing bad).  </li>
      <li>I personally think that it smells a little cheap, but keep in mind that the last perfume I tried was &#x27;Micheal Kors.&#x27;  </li>
      <li>This a captivatingly fresh fragrance for everyday or evening use.</li>
      <li>It is light and subtle.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the perfume I got is old and has soured in the bottle, but it just doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
      <li>When I sprayed on &#x27;Pure,&#x27; I could not even smell it a few hours later.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been wearing this scent for years. I just cannot get over the value !</li>
    <li> This fragrance was given to me as a gift, because the gifters could no longer find \\&quot;Pure Moment\\&quot; and (reasonably) thought that \\&quot;Pure\\&quot; would be similar. WEll. Nothing further from the truth. This \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; smells like a cheap, cheap lab chemical. Pure Moment was subtle, floral and heavenly. I&#x27;ve had MANY compliments from complete strangers over the years. I was devastated when they discontinued it and frankly puzzled as to why they keep going with this terrible terrible aldehyde product and no longer make Pure Moment. Perhaps it smells nice on some people, but I feel like a distillery whenever I try it. I wonder how many ppl who wear it receive compliments from strangers. I would be VERY surprised if this happens. This is a personal choice, of course. If you like how the thing smells on you, then by all means, buy it.</li>
    <li> This a captivatingly fresh fragrance for everyday or evening use. It expresses its name as the wearer steps out to deal with a muddled world.</li>
    <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last but it is fine for the price!</li>
    <li> So when she began to run low I checked my usual internet sources for more. A few sights had it but the price was too high. Settled on Amazon once again. Don&#x27;t know how they do it but my order was processed very quickly even with the holiday season pressure.     The price was right and the wife is happy. What more need be said?</li>
    <li> I bought this product expecting it to be a new and refreshing scent that lasted (at least) through the morning/afternoon. I was, however, disappointed. Not only does this perfume smell like pure alcohol (ie. not an original scent, and in fact, no real scent at all), but, even the pure alcohol smell (thankfully..sorta) didnt last more than ten minutes. I would literally spray it on each day (hoping that maybe there would be scent that was just delayed in coming from the bottle somehow) and within five minutes, I would smell absolutely nothing (nothing good and nothing bad).  Now, maybe it was just the specific vendor that I bought this product from (as I noticed several different vendors of this product on Amazon), but, this product is not worth it.   There isnt even a lot of liquid in the bottle.  Definitely not something to spend your hard-earned or even easy-earned money on!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  The bottle is simple, elegant and light.... like the scent!  \\&quot;Pure\\&quot; describes the perfume notes perfectly, lasts a pretty long time.  Also is great for the office and/or going out on the weekend!  Buy the 3.7 oz, it will definitely last for a long time; just spray lightly!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this perfume every year since the last 5 yrs. And every time I wear it I am asked what perfume I am wearing. All my colleagues wanted to buy it for their wives! There&#x27;s a seller for you! The only trouble is it is not easily available so I was very glad I could order it on Amazon, have done it twice already. I am sure any woman (and her better or lesser half) would love this perfume.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and as described. Can&#x27;t think of a better way to shop for a gift.</li>
    <li> I received this from my son, and he is well aware that I hate perfume that is too heavy.  I prefer a light, clean, fresh scent, like I just stepped out of the shower, and this fits the bill.  I switch off between this, and my other favorite perfume, L&#x27;Eau De Issey by Issey Miyake.  I receive compliments on how wonderful I smell all the time, which is always nice to hear.  I love the scent, and so does my husband, so it works for me.  I highly recommend it if, like me, you don&#x27;t like hit-you-over-the-head, strong florals.</li>
    <li> I oredered this product strictly based on the review&#x27;s on Amazon.com, like most other things I buy.  It was okay, but I was not impressed.  I personally think that it smells a little cheap, but keep in mind that the last perfume I tried was &#x27;Micheal Kors.&#x27;  &#x27;Micheal Kors&#x27; lasted for a really long time.  I sprayed it on my sweatshirt and didn&#x27;t wear it for a couple days, then when I went to wear it again it still smelled of the fragrance.  When I sprayed on &#x27;Pure,&#x27; I could not even smell it a few hours later.  &#x27;Pure,&#x27; has a floraly scent and somewhat reminds me of the old &#x27;Exclaimation&#x27; perfume.</li>
    <li> As noted by other reviewers, Pure isn&#x27;t easy to find, especially at such a reasonable price -- and thank goodness for Prime shipping options!&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I -- and more importantly -- my wife think this is a lovely, nearly unique, but not overpowering fragrance good for wearing anytime.&lt;br /&gt;I first bought it for my wife 5 or 6 years ago -- for some reason, I thought back then it was spelled Pur (no e) -- and was pleasantly surprised how much she liked it. (Everyone knows what a gamble it is for us men to buy fragrances that our women have not pre-approved!)&lt;br /&gt;But if you/she haven&#x27;t smelled it, I&#x27;d suggest trying to find it at your local department store and ask them for a whiff. No description you&#x27;ll find in these ratings can substitute for your/her nose.</li>
    <li> Pure was the only fragrance I would wear several years ago.  It got difficult to find so I switched to something else. But I am ecstatic that Amazon has it!  When I wore Pure, I got many compliments &amp; was often asked what it was.  I fell in love with the scent when I found an advertising swatch inside a magazine.  I don&#x27;t like anything heavy &amp; musky, but I also don&#x27;t want to smell like a rose garden.  This is a great fragrance regardless of your age.  Try it! (Also if you get a gift set that has the soap in it, put it the drawer with your \\&quot;delicates\\&quot;.  It makes them smell wonderful.)</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the service from this company. Love this perfume!</li>
    <li> received the product in great time, looked good, my daughter will be elected. this perfume was her signature scent, I am so happy we found it and for such a fabulous price.Thank you</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Pure\\&quot; was recommended as a fragrance so light, it can be worn by people who suffer migraines.  I&#x27;ve worn it for years now and this spray version is no different.  Just a little goes a long way but leaves a light, beautiful scent!</li>
    <li> love this perfume, always purchase it from amazon..</li>
    <li> soft and alluring.  Not too strong but noticeable.  Love it</li>
    <li> My very favourite perfume....</li>
    <li> This scent is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve been using it for close to ten years now.  It is clean and fresh without being over powering.  I bought it for a Mom a couple of years ago &amp; she loves it also.  This purchase was to replenish her supply.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great--it&#x27;s nice a fresh smelling BUT it doesn&#x27;t last, sadly.</li>
    <li> Excdellent product and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the perfume I got is old and has soured in the bottle, but it just doesn&#x27;t smell right. The reminiscent scent of Pure is there, but with a sourness to it. I guess I can&#x27;t expect much more when opting to buy a perfume that has been discontinued. Take into account that if you buy this, it probably won&#x27;t be just as you expect, if you are a Pure lover, as the perfume has probably been sitting around awhile.</li>
    <li> I sent my husband to buy &amp;#34;Sung&amp;#34; for me He came back wwith &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34;. I tried it and now I was loving &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34;along with my favorite &amp;#34;Sung&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  My wife loves it and I love it on my wife.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the only place I have found Pure by Alfred Sung. I am so excited that I can still get it and at a great price!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who likes a light and floral clean scent. The only drawback is that the scent does not last long.</li>
    <li> Outstanding. I would buy this item again if needed. It fits just right with no problems at all. Buy It.</li>
    <li> To my understanding this perfume is a disco&#x27;d item and I was delighted to find it . It&#x27;s truly a clean beautiful scent.&lt;br /&gt;fast shipper , will do business again</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite parfum and this is the best price around! I luv to smell....and I absolutely LOVE the price!</li>
    <li> This perfume works for me because I am one of those women who can get headaches and sick to my stomach from overpowering scents. It might be too light for some.</li>
    <li> For those of you who like flowery smell this is the perfume for you. My husband went wild with the smell because it is very appealing ohhh thank you Alfred Sung and amazon for great service and quality products.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  It is light and subtle.  Wish it had more staying power.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite of all of the Sung fragrances.</li>
    <li> This scent is one of my favorite - Alfred Sung has a great line of perfumes, but this is the one for me.</li>
    <li> This is a clean, pretty floral with notes of tangerine, orchid, lily, peony and amber in a base of sandalwood and musk. It&#x27;s light, and suitable for anytime wear, and has decent longevity. I find it a little bit on the boring side, but its good for those times when one of my more &#x27;interesting&#x27; fragrances would be too much. Recommend to anyone who likes light floral scents.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful perfume - light, floral and sensual.  Some call it an old perfume. I call it a classic fragrance.</li>
    <li> I red some reviews before I bought this BAD quality perfume for my GIRL and the worst part you will look very STUPID and CHEAP guy in front of any LADY, It is HORRIBLE ! Now I know why they are WARNING you before you buy it \\&quot; ONCE YOU OPENED THE BOX IT DOES NOT HAVE RETURN \\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Smelled like Murphy&#x27;s Oil Soap; I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I swear to you all....this smells so fresh, free, and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be where Marc Jacobs got inspiration for Daisy because that is what it smells like but less potent. Ladies do yourself a favor and grab this perfume!</li>
    <li> Received on time. Love this purchase</li>
    <li> Nice clean smell, not over powering like most scents on the market.</li>
    <li> Love it!  On time. No problems.</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume. I use it occasionally for a change. It&#x27;s clean and light scented. For a daily scent, I use Tracy Ellen perfume which you can get from Amazon for a great price or at TJ Maxx.</li>
