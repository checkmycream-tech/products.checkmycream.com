      <li>Feels great on my skin.</li>
      <li>Recommended by my dermatologist, I purchased the product and am happy with results.  </li>
      <li>It was a gift and my mom loved it.</li>
      <li>I get compliments on my skin so it must be doing something good.</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t  as good as the Neostrata Gel</li>
      <li>Still using it, but I feel good with this item.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>However, after using for more than one week, I founded it is really good.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite beauty products.</li>
      <li>Love it, will buy again.</li>
      <li>I have the weirdest, most reactive skin.</li>
      <li>Very good product that shows effects almost instantly!!</li>
      <li>I love how it can clean out my pore and brighten my skin.</li>
      <li>It made skin smooth.</li>
      <li>It increases the cell turn-over of my skin which helps prevent blackheads and leaves the skin smooth.  </li>
      <li>It also keeps my face softer and blackhead free.</li>
      <li>Originally I did not like it, because I did not see any improvements after using it for a couple of days and I needed to do additional UV protection for it.</li>
      <li>This is working amazing well, wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to give my face such a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>I love the gel, quick &amp; easy to apply, I already ordered my second</li>
      <li>Although it was the first time for me to use the AHA product, I do not think 15 irritated my skin, so I think it is safe for daily use.</li>
      <li>I ordered a stronger AHA gel...20% in a different brand because I thought stronger would be better</li>
      <li>I pretty much keep Sephora and DermStore in business.</li>
      <li>Just a small amount is required for good results.</li>
      <li>Shipped really fast.</li>
      <li>first few times will seem a bit strong and your skin will peel off but this stuff works miracles!</li>
      <li>Just to forewarn, my face broke out more for the first few weeks of use before it cleared up.  </li>
      <li>Your face will stay clear!!</li>
      <li>this AHA 15 Gel is always part of it because the high quality glycolic acid you’re getting is less irritating and more effective than lesser quality brands.</li>
      <li>I began using this product when I was 14 after I had tried everything from over the counter to prescription products to clear up my moderately severe acne.  </li>
      <li>I have every kind of skin issue possible and am too old to invest in an expensive overhaul.</li>
      <li>is comparable to other products out there at a much lower price.</li>
      <li>I would suggest using a small amount or mixing with a mild moisturizer the first few weeks of use for those who haven&#x27;t tried glycolic acid before.</li>
      <li>The Gel Plus stings the first few times, but put it on before bed, after your scrub/wash/rinse your face, and go to sleep with it on.</li>
      <li>Since I moved to here, my skin became sensitive and dry.</li>

    <li> It was a gift and my mom loved it. Shipped really fast.</li>
    <li> Product is suggested by my brother in law who is a family doctor. I love how it can clean out my pore and brighten my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent maintenance product. I use this every night. It keeps my face glowing and it controls the oil during the day. It also keeps my face softer and blackhead free.</li>
    <li> Very good product that shows effects almost instantly!! first few times will seem a bit strong and your skin will peel off but this stuff works miracles!</li>
    <li> This is working amazing well, wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to give my face such a healthy glow. I ordered a stronger AHA gel...20% in a different brand because I thought stronger would be better but it wasn&#x27;t  as good as the Neostrata Gel Plus 15...I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> wonderful! i like it, i hope it will bring me different, it looks a little small but i like it anyway</li>
    <li> Neostrata Gel Plus AHA 15 is an excellent product! I was almost heartbroken one of the times I ordered because they sent the wrong item and I was out of my Neostrata Gel Plus AHA 15. This product is an excellent AHA product whose brand has been recommend by my dermatologist for over 20 years. She swears by Neostrata! I mix up my routine a bit but this AHA 15 Gel is always part of it because the high quality glycolic acid you’re getting is less irritating and more effective than lesser quality brands. I cause that if you have not used at least a 10% AHA on your face then approach with caution. You may end up with a red, burned face or dryness and peeling. I never had any problems with this product, but as I always say, YMMV. I am not related to this product or company in any way and please remember, YMMV. This is just my personal experience with the product.</li>
    <li> I began using this product when I was 14 after I had tried everything from over the counter to prescription products to clear up my moderately severe acne.  This was the ONLY thing that ever worked for me.  Just to forewarn, my face broke out more for the first few weeks of use before it cleared up.  I am now almost 30 and am still using the product.  It increases the cell turn-over of my skin which helps prevent blackheads and leaves the skin smooth.  I would suggest using a small amount or mixing with a mild moisturizer the first few weeks of use for those who haven&#x27;t tried glycolic acid before.</li>
    <li> I love the gel, quick &amp; easy to apply, I already ordered my second bottle!&lt;br /&gt;This is comparable to other products out there at a much lower price.</li>
    <li> My skin gets brighter</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin. It feels like it is helping my skin.</li>
    <li> Since I moved to here, my skin became sensitive and dry. It getting worse than worse when I try to use more lotion to moisture it. I was so desperate to save my face. I purchased this produce and carry on to use it for two weeks. It does help to reduced the spot and my skin getting smoother and brighter.  Now I use it everywhere, if any emergency! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite beauty products.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, I purchased the product and am happy with results.  Just a small amount is required for good results.</li>
    <li> I have every kind of skin issue possible and am too old to invest in an expensive overhaul. I found Neostrat Gel Plus AHA to be an affordable and quality solution to exfoliating and reducing the size of my pores.</li>
    <li> Originally I did not like it, because I did not see any improvements after using it for a couple of days and I needed to do additional UV protection for it. I even thought of returning it. However, after using for more than one week, I founded it is really good. It made skin smooth. Although it was the first time for me to use the AHA product, I do not think 15 irritated my skin, so I think it is safe for daily use. Love it, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Dermatologist recommended it.  Works on moderate acne and wrinkles.  I get compliments on my skin so it must be doing something good.</li>
    <li> I have the weirdest, most reactive skin. It can be fine and then 2 weeks later I&#x27;ll get a weird, painful, deep acne cyst. And I always get some bad zit at least once a month. I have used every expensive skin regimen you can think of. I pretty much keep Sephora and DermStore in business. Anyway, since I stumbled upon washing my face with St. Ives scrub (the &amp;#34;Blemish&amp;#34; version) and then with Neutrogena Mens Skin Clearing Acne Wash (I&#x27;m a female but this stuff rocks) and then applying this Neostrata Gel Plus and leaving it on, I have not had one cystic acne outbreak...not even a big pimple...in 2 months...ever since I started the regimen i described. The Gel Plus stings the first few times, but put it on before bed, after your scrub/wash/rinse your face, and go to sleep with it on. Your face will stay clear!!</li>
    <li> Still using it, but I feel good with this item.</li>
