      <li>There isn&#x27;t a product I haven&#x27;t tried, particularly in the past 5 years trying to make sags, wrinkles, dark under-eye circles, etc..look better.</li>

    <li> This is the best makeup for me.  Really light, but it has good coverage to help my skin look more even.  Doesn&#x27;t get cakey in wrinkled areas. I just hate how long it takes for shipping!</li>
    <li> Received item quickly an it was as described</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Best coverage I have ever found in a foundation yet it does not feel like I have anything on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this make up it is Fabulous. The color was perfect for me. It does not break my face out. It came on time. Would buy from this supplier again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had this foundation recommended to me by a friend but I didn&#x27;t want to deal face to face with a consultant so this worked perfectly. Love how creamy and light it is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cr&amp;egrave;me-to-powder foundation for years and I love the coverage.  My daughter frequently compliments my flawless complexion when I use it.  I don&#x27;t have a flawless complexion so it provides good coverage without being heavy or too made up. I hope Mary Kay never stops making this product!</li>
    <li> The foundation arrived before the delivery date, and in great condition.  The foundation goes on smoothly, is easy to blend, and can be layered if you want more covereage.  I like the coverage this foundation gives with just one coat.  The foundation turns to a powdery finish after applying but does not settle into my fine lines.  Applies easily, cleans off easily.  My face is not shiny at the end of the day nor does the foundation wear off by day&#x27;s end.  I will very likely order this foundation again, and I do recommend it for combination oily skin.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted, very good price!</li>
    <li> Hard to get spread evenly on face.</li>
    <li> Only kind of make up I wear! Love the Crème-to-Powder Foundation.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this stuff for years and years and it is the ONLY foundation i will ever use. stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t get oily and i never break out. well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this foundation and would buy again because it&#x27;s so well make to include the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Kay got a excellent from be because the product is well worth the price with Amazon. I would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Ivory 2 was the right color and it does cover the imperfections on your face.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a product I haven&#x27;t tried, particularly in the past 5 years trying to make sags, wrinkles, dark under-eye circles, etc..look better. This one is fabulous!! The best I&#x27;ve ever used, by far.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Mary Kay but cannot always get it when I need. Great product and great service !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cream to Powder for years.  I like the way it applies so smoothly and evenly, and covers well.</li>
    <li> It was expired product. They kept the box but you can still figure out expiration if you were a consultant</li>
    <li> Excellent Mary Kay product.  I do not care for the current MK formula so was glad to have my favorite.</li>
    <li> Very good powder, feels light covers well!</li>
    <li> I like this product. The coverage is really good. I usually go over it with the mineral foundation, though, just to get a really smooth look.</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay since 1979.  At that time, the foundation was $3.00.  Through the years I have found that my investment has been worth it.  Even though it seems pricey now, I would plan to continue to use this product for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Makes my face break out and has a fragrance to it do not like</li>
    <li> The creme to powder foundation is easy to apply and never looks \\&quot;pancakey\\&quot; or unnatural. I wear make up only if going out at night. This foundation makes my skin feel better and softer after I&#x27;ve used it--doesn&#x27;t make me feel like my pores have been blocked the way some liquid foundations do. I&#x27;ve used it for several years.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my order..I paid half of what I would of paid.</li>
    <li> It covers everything perfectly, but very inconvenient to use it when I go out. There is no &#x27;applicator&#x27; that normally is sold with the powders and there is no place to put it. So, I am carrying this powder and the applicator in a plastic bag separately ;-) (also no instruction which applicator should be used with such type of powders...)</li>
    <li> You only havve to use one foundation and powder is in one. I have ben using this for years and I love it</li>
    <li> Great natural looking foundation. Does not feel greasy or wear off quickly.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ordering Mary Kay Creme-to-powder foundation. I love it! And the color looks just as the photo on the listing. Very fast delivery.</li>
