<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Love EcoTools brushes. Great soft brushes for the money. Good value. They hold up well to multiple cleanings. They do a good job for certain make-up applications.</li>
    <li> EcoTools is a brand I really trust. This blush brush is great for applying blush, bronzer, and illuminator. Very soft, luxurious brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is really the best blush brush I&#x27;ve had. Granted, I&#x27;ve only tried the ELF blush brush but the EcoTool blush brush is so so SO much better than the ELF one. First off, it&#x27;s so dang fluffy! It&#x27;s thick and poofy. The bristles are so soft but hold up, not too squishy but not too firm either. And the size is perfect, bigger than what I&#x27;m used to with the ELF brush. Putting on blush now is so fast. You dab your blush with the brush, and then you apply on your cheeks (I just dab dab dab the apples of my cheeks a couple times to get the color on them) and in literally 5 seconds you&#x27;re done. Such a great brush.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a sturdy, inexpensive gorgeously soft blush brush. YOU&#x27;VE FOUND IT!!!    I used it for blush and a small bit of bronzer and its perfect.     I would recommend this ten times over.     Soooo worth it.     Go for it :)</li>
    <li> This is the BEST blush brush I have ever used!  It picks up the blush very easily and applies evenly and beautifully!  If ever I need another blush brush, I will get another one of these without a doubt!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not a makeup fanatic, but i do use blush every day and this brush is perfect. it&#x27;s soft, easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t shed, and is very affordable. sometimes i go to sephora and see the 30 dollar brushes and i&#x27;m just like, WHY??? i&#x27;m no makeup pro, but i&#x27;d say this brush is really all you need.</li>
    <li> Very soft brush, love that it&#x27;s eco-friendly. However I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s different from the foundation brush (which I also have). I would recommend getting all your make up brushes from Ecotools! :) Affordable and very gentle on your skin!</li>
    <li> I purchased several of these for the different color blush powders I have.  They are feathery soft and have worn well even after several washes.</li>
    <li> The photo above shows the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version of this blush brush... however, I wasn&#x27;t sent that one. Mine must be the older version. Boo! I&#x27;m disappointed in false advertisements.</li>
    <li> Kind of large for precision application but definitely soft and very well made. This brush shed a little on the first use. Picks up a good amount of blush and blends well.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s soft and feels great on the skin. I am happy with this purchase. I especially love the price. High quality brush for such a low price. Love it!</li>
    <li> so so. nothing special.</li>
    <li> My old blush brush was an angled one that I got in a set a few years back, and was a little prickly. the domed brush takes a little time to get used to, but eco tools&#x27; brushes are seriously so soft and amazing. i bought this one after i got a couple others - they don&#x27;t shed, they&#x27;re not prickly, and they&#x27;re the perfect fit for my hand - not too long, not too short. definitely don&#x27;t feel like cheap brushes.</li>
    <li> This is a very soft brush, perfect for powder or powder foundation. I was looking for an alternative to the bare escentuals brushes I have. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I own the Ecotools foundation brush, powder brush, and blush brush.  The blush brush is soft and doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin.  I replaced my old blush brush that would shed bristles and scratch my skin.  This does not shed, picks up my blush powder, and glides on my cheeks smoothly.  It has a high-end feel to it.  Great quality. Will continue to add more Ecotools brushes to my collection.</li>
    <li> Feels much more expensive. Soft, full brush.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush for blush. First, the bristles are incredibly soft and has held up really well after many washings and lots of use. The shape at first seems a little strange- the brush comes to a soft point- but I find this perfect for being able to control where you want to put blush. For example, I&#x27;ll just tap the tip of the point in my product and then apply it to my face to get a more focused look, or I will sweep one side of the angled brush in product and then apply that side to my face in a sweeping upwards motion, such as for gentle contouring. I think this angled shape makes the brush more versatile. IT&#x27;s also great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever tried! The price is great, the bristles are soft, and I&#x27;m supporting a company I believe in by buying it. Great choice for a brush.</li>
    <li> Only use this brand .. Very very soft to the skin.. I have very sensitive skin .. Best brushes .. Great prices ..</li>
    <li> Great wooden handle, easy to hold, very comfortable in the hand. The bristles hold well and do not come out when using the tool.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush.  It holds the powder so well and spreads it on evenly.  And the best part is that the brush doesn&#x27;t shed at all! So many times I&#x27;ve bought retractable brushes that leave individual hairs all over my skin after each application.  This one simply does a great job!  I will definitely buy more of their products.</li>
    <li> I do not like it. It is a big brush, the handle is bulky, which is not very practical, and it does apply blush well, it seems to hold on to it. I will keep using it, but wish I have chosen another one.</li>
    <li> Bought this and other brushes probably 4-5 years ago....needless to say, these are the best brushes ever! I still have all of them. Great brand!</li>
    <li> I prefer to use this brush for pressed blotting/setting powder. I have a LOT of brushes. A lot. And have found that I much prefer a flatter brush for setting powder on my oily skin. I don&#x27;t feel that big ole fluffy brushes apply pressed powders as evenly. I keep one of these in my make up bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I also think this brush can be very versatile with blushes and bronzers, or even contour. Because it&#x27;s flat and tapered, it can fit into the hollows of your cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs are super soft, too. Great brush, great price.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for a few months and I was using it every day.  I liked that it was angled but I never was able to get my blush to look pigmented enough.  A few weeks ago, I bought bronzer and blush at MAC and I loved how the two products looked contoured together when they applied them at the MAC counter.  I tried to recreate the look with this brush, but my vibrant new bronzer and blush barely showed up!  I was loading on the product but I couldn&#x27;t get the results I wanted.  So, I went back to the MAC counter and bought the MAC 168 large contour brush (WAY smaller than this brush) and in just one swipe I was able to deposit the perfect amount of blush.  All these months, using the ecotools brush, I wasted so much product because blush wasn&#x27;t really showing up dark enough without layering it on.  This blush is OK for cream blushes and for fixing an overly heavy-handed blush application, but it&#x27;s really not great for a primary blush brush.</li>
    <li> Great product, LOVE Eco Tools!!</li>
    <li> The price for this brush is a STEAL. I love EcoTools brushes- they are economically priced but are quality brushes. I also love the packaging, I don&#x27;t have a make-up brush case so I keep the brushes in the cases that come with the product and then place them in my make up case. I use this brush strictly for my blush, but if I used bronzer I would feel confident in using it for bronzer as well.</li>
    <li> Not sturdy enough to contour like some people suggested but great for blush. It&#x27;s soft and applies makeup beautifully</li>
    <li> I really love this blush brush. It spreads my blush so nicely and the brush never sheds. I do find that when the brush isn&#x27;t cleaned every time it doesn&#x27;t work quite as nicely. All you have to do is rub a tiny bit of shampoo into the bristles and rinse it out and your brush will be good as new :) Brush does take a while to dry as well so you will want to wash it after you&#x27;re done useing it, leave it out for the day to dry and then use it the next day.</li>
    <li> really soft brush, rounded size applies the perfect amount of color to the cheeks and blends color well. if you just want a flush of color on the apples of your cheeks this is the ideal size blush brush. also works for bronzing the forehead. the handle is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space in my brush cup. i&#x27;ve used and washed it quite a bit and i have not experienced any shedding/loose hairs. this brush is just as good as my expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Nice brush for the price</li>
    <li> Yes, the bristles on this brush are very soft and it is a good quality handle, etc., however, I find it very difficult to apply my blush with it.  The bristles seem to hold onto the blush.  My two dollar e.l.f. brush worked better than this one. :(</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft and fluffy and blends the blush onto your cheeks just perfectly! I also love the reusable pouch it comes in, so I can carry it along with me in my purse!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brush that I own. I have a few other blush brushes, but none of them are as great as this one. It&#x27;s suuuuuper soft and applies blush beautifully and evenly. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Price is great, the product is awesome and the quality is excellent!  Thank you!  Will buy again!  Easy Transaction!</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t expecting much, especially when I can&#x27;t exam before my purchase.... but this item is exceed my expectation. I don&#x27;t mind to use it on my face.</li>
    <li> Love this brand for &amp;#34;inexpensive&amp;#34; brushes.  Can&#x27;t really go wrong.  I use this for blush mostly, but sometimes highlighter or bronzer definition.  It&#x27;s well made and has never lost a single bristle even though I wash it fairly regularly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little softer than I&#x27;d like, but my blush looks nice, so I&#x27;m content.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Works great with mineral make up! Would recommend this brand. I actually have mostlf this brands brushes and have no complaints. Have lasted a long time as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through some cheap brushes and some wonderful, expensive ones, and these are by far my favorite.  I recommend them to anyone, because they are made so well- they don&#x27;t shed like other brushes AND they&#x27;re soft as hell.  Love them- 10 stars!</li>
    <li> This is the first Ecotools brush I&#x27;ve owned and it won&#x27;t be the last! It is very soft, durable, and easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product which is perfect for a blush brush. It spreads the blush out evenly.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I purchased Ecotools brushes and honestly, I loved the quality and not to mention the price. Planning to get more for sure!</li>
    <li> This brush isn&#x27;t just super soft, it also works! Grabs product wonderfully. This is my go to brush of everyday make up! I clean it every week, it&#x27;s been about a year since I got and it looks like it is brand new! I recommend it and buy it to any and every friend who needs brushes or are starting their make up collection!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush, but packaged in a plastic sleeve.  Plastic and eco-friendliness do not mingle.  I am rather disappointed that a company that claims to respect the planet could not have come up with a packaging solution more in synch with its message</li>
    <li> love it, very soft brush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. The shape and size of the brush are perfect for putting on just the right amount of blush. I love the eco-friendly nature of it. I will be buying more makeup brushes from them in the future.</li>
    <li> great brush. Not cheaply made either. i love EcoTools products. Price is the same as in the store, so i just order from amazon so i dont have to go anywhere, and it gets delivered straight to me lol</li>
    <li> I have been searching for some good brushes and am happy to have found these!  They are very soft and pick up the product nicely!</li>
    <li> Soft. No shedding. Just right for bronzer.</li>
    <li> They get better w/ age and apply and pick up product the more you use it and wash it. I have never lost a hair and purchased two, I use this as a multipurpose brush - powder, blush, finishing - love this brush!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a blush brush and it does what it&#x27;s meant to do. I don&#x27;t end up with blobs on my face. It places it where it needs to be. I have a lot of control with this brush. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have purchased other face brushes before at high end shops at much higher prices, which have all left bristles on my face.  This one does not!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really not much to say here.  The brush worked great for our purposes.  We recently bought a second one.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decide to believe at the good ones. I don&#x27;t have any regret. The brush is soft and I love the case, I use to put my foundation brush there too.&lt;br /&gt;It spreads the blush evenly and don&#x27;t get too much, just the perfect amount.</li>
    <li> Its fantastic! Really great brush for beginners like me :)</li>
    <li> I got a set of these brushes and they were too big and took up space and were hard to work with. Somehow I kept this one and it is a gem. It is very soft and thick so blush or bronzer goes on very well. I didn&#x27;t push hard enough before as with most that be a bad idea and cause too much to be applied and irritate the skin. In this case it felt soft and applied beautifully.  I recommend them all, but be aware of the size and different texture. For the price they are very durable and well made.  I didn&#x27;t have room for set of them. It cluttered my makeup area. This is one of the smaller ones too.</li>
    <li> Love this product, love the line and everything it stands for. The brushes hold up very well and are great quality!</li>
    <li> I hate when the bristles fall off blush brushes (and end up on your face). This brush is nice and soft, and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old brush was one of those fluffy ones, this is more of a flatter (although not flat)/rounded brush. It still works for me!</li>
    <li> Very soft and good quality.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and I loved the way it applied my blush. BUT I just washed it with the cleaner I use on all of my brushes and the entire brush fell out of the barrel. SO DISAPPOINTED! It seems like it was really poorly made. I am returning this.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles, sturdy brush.  Cheap enough to toss after a while and get a new one too since I am not a fan of washing my brushes out.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It is soft and fluffy and gives a great application.  If it is turned on it&#x27;s side, it works really well for contouring with my bronzer.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  Great value.  Works as well as the expensive ones.  Very soft and functional!</li>
    <li> Great blush brush!!! And washes really well, never looses bristles.</li>
    <li> I LOVE ECOTOOLS PRODUCTS aré the best quality</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but this brush is a great tool - much nicer than some that I&#x27;ve bought that were double or triple the price.  I definitely plan to buy others from this line.</li>
    <li> Did a great job putting on the blush.  Very easy to use.  Applies just the right amount and easy to clean. Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This brush is so nice! It&#x27;s just so soft and it does an amazing job with blush! The little pouch it comes with is nice too!</li>
    <li> Bristles are soft and gentle, brush is handy on the same time. Easy to clean and dry fast. Very versatile because of the way how it&#x27;s sharpened. Becomes the part of my daily routine now.&lt;br /&gt;I could really recommend if you are looking for quality, good price and multiple ways to use.</li>
    <li> I like this brush a lot. Super soft. Good shape for cheekbones. EcoTools are a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Best blush brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve had it for around seven months now and still holds up good. I wash my EcoTools brushes with warm soapy water every once and a while and I&#x27;m proud to say that NONE of them have shed even one single bristle. They&#x27;re super soft too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush to go along with the eyeshadow brushes that I also purchased.  This brush is very large and very soft; something different from my previous brush, so it is taking some getting used to.  But it seems to apply the blush it a very subtle and nice way.  It gives it a very natural appearance.  My only complaint is that the brush is somewhat flat and misshapen from being in the packaging.  I am hoping it will fill out with time.</li>
    <li> Really great application and very great feeling on the skin. A little bit&lt;br /&gt;Big, so if you like big brushes get it!</li>
    <li> This brush is so incredibly soft! I love how the bristles feel. I also like how it applies blush - I use cream blush that can go on a little too thick if you&#x27;re not careful, but this gives such a beautiful light coating. Really happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my Elf blush brush, which had turned out to be a rough disappointment. I was debating between a Sigma brush or this one, and decided to give this one a try. I don&#x27;t have any other Ecotools brushes, so I was excited to receive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the package, you can feel the quality and craftsmanship. The synthetic brush is extremely soft and I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding. It also has no smell. The bamboo handle is sturdy and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tapered bristles make blush and bronzer application easy and flawless. You don&#x27;t have to spend time blending out harsh lines that other brushes create. It picks up enough product and doesn&#x27;t hold onto it, and it doesn&#x27;t dig into your powder blushes and bronzers like other rough or flat ones do where they leave the loose powder on the top, you know what I mean? I hate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this brush. For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it, even just to try it out or add to your arsenal of brushes. I have already added a few more Ecotools brushes to my Wish List and can&#x27;t wait to try them all!</li>
    <li> Love Ecotools brushes! Best brushes I&#x27;ve tried. So soft, doesn&#x27;t fall out. Perfect. Bought five of these for my friends for Christmas, put them in a makeup bag. They love it.!</li>
    <li> This brush is super soft, doesn&#x27;t shed at all, and picks up product really easily. I love it.</li>
    <li> The brush I received looks like the one pictured here from the ferule down but the shape of the brush itself is totally different. It almost comes to a point. I have no idea what to do with this brush.</li>
    <li> This the softest brush you will ever use! Delivers just the right amount of powdered blush where you want it. Can&#x27;t imagine a better brush and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Works great for the price.  I added this on my order to get free shipping.  I believe this brush can be purchased at Walmart for around the same price.</li>
    <li> there is not much to say about this brush, it is very affordable, very soft, and great for countering and blush&lt;br /&gt;because od the shape of the brush you can use it for bronzer, blush and contouring! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with all my eco tools so far.  The bristles are super soft, and my make-up is looking as good as it did when I used other, less earth-friendly brushes.  I will stick with this line.</li>
    <li> Great blush brush. Very soft bristles. The taper of the brush is best for use with blush or bronzer for cheeks. Would not recommend as a foundation brush as you would need something more stiff.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a bronzer brush and it holds the bronzer really well! Blends really nice on my face and feels soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> i love ecotools brushes.  for their quaity they could easily charge double the price.  so soft, dont suck up foundation, dont give me rashes like other cheap brushes.  just amazing. and this brush is big enough to use to bronze my neck and chest but the way its tapered makes it awesome for a thin line of dark contour under the cheek bones.  must have!!</li>
    <li> Things I like about it: The bristles are amazingly smooth, the bristles hold up and don&#x27;t start bending in different directions after a while, it gets the job done, and the price is VERY fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for anyone new to makeup, or anyone needing a basic brush for everyday use. I&#x27;m a student on a budget, and this brush has been wonderful for the price I payed.&lt;br /&gt;Sure, they&#x27;re are probably more outstanding brushes out there for alot more money, but this one is great if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any major issues with this brush! It does it&#x27;s job rather well.</li>
    <li> This brush is seriously perfect. One swipe is all I need, it&#x27;s soft and has a nice airbrush effect.</li>
    <li> Love my Eco Tools brushes, what&#x27;s a girl to do without them :-)</li>
    <li> I am surprised by all the good reviews on this product. The only thing I can think of is that one has not used a a high quality $30+ make up brush before to compare it to. This brush has few brissles, resulting in a very small amount of pigment being picked up. It is just terrible for applying my Nars blush, barely any color comes off the brush. Anywho, once again, I have learned my lesson NOT to cut corners but just get the real deal right off the bat. Now I have a make up brush that won&#x27;t be used and have to buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus of this brush and why I gave it 2 stars is, of course, that it IS Eco friendly and that is always appreciated. Also, the brissles are super soft.</li>
    <li> Very good quality.Will order this brand again.</li>
    <li> The best blush brush I have ever owned. I have been using this brush for approx. 4 years, and is still going strong after many washings. This brush hasn&#x27;t lost 1 hair!!!!</li>
    <li> Very soft, but stands up nicely for applying blush. Bought to replace a Clinique blush because of the bamboo handle and cruelty free bristles. I felt anything so reasonably priced could not possibly live up to the hype but it does. The brush is not as flat as it looks- a little more tapered just perfect for blush. A great find.</li>
    <li> Not the same quality Ecotools as it is used to be in the past but this is nothing to do with the seller cause the manufacturing company made changes. Original brush was wayyyy better. That being said this is OK brush.</li>
    <li> I use this for my powder foundation. I love how soft it is and how it makes my powder foundation blend nicely. I also give props for the fact it doesn&#x27;t shed bristles all over my face. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Even coverage, doesn&#x27;t fall apart with use, easy to clean, longer lengths make the brushes easier to hold - quite happy with product</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the best brush on the market, but it isn&#x27;t the most expensive either. No shedding so far. It is itchy on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t really hold powder product as well I as thought it would.</li>
    <li> So soft.  Applied powder so evenly.  Use it every day and love it.  Will by the same one again when it&#x27;s time.  Would recommend product and seller to anyone.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell u what a g</li>
    <li> This is a great blush applying make-up brush. The bristles are soft and smooth. One would think that a brush of this quality would cost a lot more, but the cost was very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Shopgirl</li>
    <li> Love this brush, so soft. The Ferrell is strong, and after washing it numerous times, no shedding at all!</li>
    <li> Soft and feel very natural.</li>
    <li> Soft and easy to clean. The shape is easy to use too.</li>
    <li> Help blush look more natural. Super soft bristles are perfect!! I also have the powder brush. Everyone should have these.</li>
    <li> I constantly wash my brushes and use different powder products. I love it, it lasts and is inexpensive. The design is excellent, the brush is extremely soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheap eco-friendly blush brush and this did it for me. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years now and I still use it. It&#x27;s a great brush and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an afforable blush brush.</li>
    <li> OMG I got this along with the fan brush and i&#x27;m so excited. I&#x27;ve wanted to get this fir a long time and I finally have it! the first time i got this brush it was still the original design in a drugstore but i got a defective one. The good on that particular one wasn&#x27;t strong and i guess the bristles fell off so i had to throw it D: i was devastated!&lt;br /&gt;I got this one and looked closely at the bristles and it is alot better! I guess i got unlucky with the one before but not this time. These brand of brushes are so soft and i absolutely love them! but anyway this one i got it so beautiful i love it. I love blush so i needed a good brush. I can&#x27;t wait to use this &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This is an awesome starter blush brush. It picks up a good amount of color, is easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t lose hairs if you treat it right (wet and swirl gently with a brush cleaner or clear liquid soap, rinse, reshape, and leave to dry with the hairs pointed down). I&#x27;ve been using this for several years, and although I&#x27;ve moved up from other EcoTools brushes, this one has held out really well and hasn&#x27;t given me reason to replace it.</li>
    <li> This is the best blush brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Have bought expensive Mac brushes, that just fall apart.  This is study, well made and the perfect size!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with ecotools, I seek out these products specifically, I think this brand is wonderful. The brush is perfect for blush, and arrived early.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best Blush Brush I have ever tried! I love it so much! It is super soft and does exactly what its supposed to do!</li>
    <li> Satisfied with product. Works well for the use it is intended for. Item is easy to clean and keeps well.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these were the same ones my friend bought at a local walgreens--she found cheap, eco friendly bamboo brushes that are well made and super soft. I found these bristles not to be terribly soft. They are so-so. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, and if it were cheaper to return, I would return it. It&#x27;s not worth it though.</li>
    <li> So soft it works best with mineral powder blushes. Amazing quality</li>
    <li> I love this brand and would give a better rating, but I didn&#x27;t expect that you had to be home for delivery.  I wish i would have known that before ordering.  Maybe I missed the shipping info in the small print, but know i have to stay home to receive them tomorrow or otherwise pay to pick them up fro  ups.</li>
    <li> Great soft brush only problem is they sent me two instead of one</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage, and just the right angle to glide up the cheekbone. Able to get enough blush on without it dumping on or feeling cakey. Also, feels very gentle against the skin (for those of you with extremely sensitive skin like me).</li>
    <li> I am not as crazy about this as the powder brush, but it&#x27;s still a very nice brush for the money, I find that whatever is In powder blush tends make the bristles stiff after time- a long time- even after a thorough cleaning. But I just bought another one, because you can&#x27;t beat the price and quality.</li>
    <li> This brush is sooooo soft i love it ! It are very accurate and useful. I have no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Great product and it does what is needs. I would be nice if there were other retractable brushes made by ecotools but I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the eye brushes first and was hooked. They are inexpensive but not cheap! They do the job and do it well. I own some pricier brushes and find myself reaching for this one more often! You wont be disappointed. Good brush</li>
    <li> used a few times since receiving but haven&#x27;t washed yet. Very soft and well shaped. Would buy again</li>
    <li> When used correctly - apply by dabbing with sides of brush.. bottom of bush should be facing upwards -&lt;br /&gt;it works perfectly. Not heavy and an even application. Used for 2 weeks now and no hair bristle or hair has fallen.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price for a good blush brush!</li>
    <li> This is a nice blush brush which i use every day.</li>
    <li> Great brush, takes more than overnight to dry because it&#x27;s so full and bushy.</li>
    <li> This blush brush exceeded my expectations. Eco - friendly and comes in a little pouch for easy storage. It is the softest brush I have ever felt and is completely cruelty - free. I love it. Five stars.</li>
    <li> Great price (2 brushes).  They have officially replaced by e.l.f. brushes now :)&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t dealt with any shedding and they are very dense</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and based on reviews about Eco Tools in a fashion magazine I thought I would give it a try.  The blush brush is perfect and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Considerably more at Walmart. EcoTools make quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought it and I thought be a round blush brush. This blush brush is not the same on their website. I open it came as a triangle flat brush. I tired it out and I cannot blend in circle motion. Blush brush is support to blend your makeup easy. I find it hard to blend. I dont want my blush to be a straight line bold blush. I want my blush to look natural. This blush brush is more idea for contour or highlight than a blush brush</li>
    <li> I recently changed my makeup to Laura Mercier, using this blush brush. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this and I was scared that it wouldn&#x27;t be that great because of the price. That or the quality wasn&#x27;t great. Took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;This has exceeded my expectations and I am not disappointed. In fact, I bought some of the Laura Mercier makeup brushes, when now I know I could have (and would have) purchased an entire makeup set of these EcoTools brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is so soft, so lush, thick and ...hefty? Not cheap. Looks great and feels good in the hand. Not a heavy weighted brush, so I think that&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s great for coverage and nice and fluffy and soft!</li>
    <li> This brush was better than I expected. I was surprised that the price was so low. It is SOOOO soft on my cheeks. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good blush brush at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. Good size, covers well, and the bristles stay in place. I recommend this blush brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft, so I just use it if I want to wear light brush. I also own one of the older blush brushes with the older design and I would prefer the older design because it feels fuller. Other than that, I was happy about this brush and the softness.</li>
    <li> great brush feels very smooth , dont waste money on expensive one , just get this one its worth it</li>
    <li> I love almost everything Eco Tools makes. This blush brush is really really soft, even after washing. It&#x27;s pretty dense, but not as much as the retractable kabuki or anything. The only problem I have with it is that it&#x27;s a little big for my face. I tend to apply blush on the tops of my cheekbones and in sort of a line, but if you usually apply blush over a larger area, I doubt this will be a problem. If not, it&#x27;s also great for other powder products.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush, I use it for applying blush and it works perfectly. I do wish the bristles were a bit softer, but you can&#x27;t have it for the price at which this brush is at! Overall I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had one other brush for my blush before so this brush being tapered felt weird to me when I use it. Otherwise, I really like how soft it is and the quality!</li>
    <li> So soft and nice. Glides right on and I spend less time putting make up on</li>
    <li> Bought this for contouring. So far it does a great job without applying the product too heavily. The bristles are soft, and they are easily cleaned. I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> very good . was excatcly what i order. very good quality . i will order more soon and price are good</li>
    <li> BUY IT AT WAL MART ON SALE BUT GREAT PRODUCT. I LOVE THIS ECO LINE OF MAKEUP TOOLS. JUST BE CAREFUL WITH EYESHADOE BRUSHES BC TGHEY CAN SPREAD THE POWDER TO THE SIDES OF YOUR EYES TOWARDS YOUR EARS. REALLY IT DEPENDS ON THE MAKEUP DENSITY. GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I do like this product but I also like the other blush brushes that I have. It does a great job applying the blush to my face. Also I like have many options for makeup tools.</li>
    <li> Super soft brush that works great for blush application.</li>
    <li> Really nice brush.  A plus is it is easy to only pick up a little color of your blush if you want a natural look.</li>
    <li> Super soft brush! Don&#x27;t know how hard everyone else is on here with their brushes because the bristles are holding in just fine and I&#x27;ve used it for a good while now!</li>
    <li> Nice brush, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Soft brush, nice price! I plan to add even more EcoTools brushes to my collection. They are not only environmentally friendly, but also work great, handles have good shape and feel, so soft! This applies the blush evenly and nicely. I think EcoTools has made some fabulous products and at affordable prices, which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> My moms blush brush finally bit the dust, and when I saw her using an eyeshadow brush in hand I had to put an end to the madness. It&#x27;s larger than what I use, but it blends well for her. Let&#x27;s face it--it&#x27;s much quicker than an eye brush. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use eco tools for all but one of my brushes. Great brand, great price, great quality. They wash well, and last for years.</li>
    <li> I use this blush brush with creme blush.  It picks up the blush evenly and gives me good coverage.  The blush adheres just to the tapered tip of the brush and I use the sides to gently blend it in.  I have more expensive brushes with natural bristles, but this brush works better than any of the others.  I think the firm tapered tip is the key.  It deposits the color just where I want it. I&#x27;ve learned that using a brush with cream blush uses less product, which is important because the blush I use (Nars Multiple in Malibu) is very expensive and I want to conserve it as much as possible.  The tapered tip gives me sheer coverage deposited just on a apple of my cheeks.  I gently tap it in and swirl the brush a little to get even coverage.  The blush goes on very smoothly and blending with the sides of the brush is really effective and makes my cheeks look like I have a natural flush.  I have several of these brushes for several different blushes and it works well with all of them.  This brush is also very easy to wash; just a little baby shampoo worked into the bristles and a good rinse and they&#x27;re good to go.  They also dry completely overnight.  I haven&#x27;t used this brush with powder blush, but I suppose it would work equally well.  I think the best feature of this brush is the tapered tip.  I have many expensive natural bristle brushes that don&#x27;t work as well as this one.  This is a great product.  My local drugstore no longer carries the individual EcoTools blush brushes so I&#x27;m purchasing one on Amazon.  I heartily recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> The brush i purchased was in a great condition the only problem i had with it was that it had a weird smell to it and after several washes the smell still hasnt gone away.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It&#x27;s really soft and applies the blush in a natural looking way.  A very good buy!</li>
    <li> Always 5 stars with the products.</li>
    <li> I liked this brush because its big and fluffy, the  handle isn&#x27;t too long, and its reasonably priced.  I have no complaints about this brush.  I like that the company is environmentally conscious and produces quality brushes.  The brush is soft, full and fluffy with no shedding.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good solid brush I wanted a large end, but it was my fault for not understanding the dimensions that were provided</li>
    <li> This brush is incredibly soft, feels like silk against my cheeks. Places the blush perfectly, looks soft and natural. It is an excellent value for the money and exactly what I needed. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and feels great on my face. I like the way it&#x27;s shaped!</li>
    <li> I was considering buying expensive new department store makeup brushes, but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on these instead, based on the great reviews. I got this blush brush and also the bronzer brush also by EcoTools. These are soft, and distribute the blush and bronzer well. Previously I had been using Bare Minerals small brushes that were wrong for bronzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are soft and seem durable. I will definitely purchase again from EcoTools for my makeup brush needs.</li>
