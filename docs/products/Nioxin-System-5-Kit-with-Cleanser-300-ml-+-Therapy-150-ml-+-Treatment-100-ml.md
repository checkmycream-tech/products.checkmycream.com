      <li>I read it takes a good month before your hair appears thicker or</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>It is a good option just to try the system.</li>
      <li>The product has worked fairly well.</li>
      <li>I got the product very quickly and in good condition, so I would say the seller was very good.</li>

      <li>Hoping to buy more!</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on my hair now!</li>
      <li>Works amazing.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the amount of hair that comes out in the shower.</li>
      <li>and I can accumulate a nice handful of locks during shower.</li>
      <li>She really liked the leave in spray.</li>
      <li>Both are clean, moisturized and happy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin products for many years and find this newest product to be an excellent improvement over the older versions.</li>
      <li>Almost done with my 4 weeks and have made good progress and have great results so far.</li>
      <li>i tried a lot of different products until somebody recommended me this (#5 works best for me) treatment system.</li>
      <li>I just had to order more b/c</li>
      <li>Diagoised with Hashimoto&#x27;s hypothyroidism and was losing more hair (mostly noticed in the shower when I wash my hair</li>
      <li>Noticed more hair loss than before.</li>
      <li>My hair looks fuller and shinny love this item.  </li>
      <li>i used it for two more weeks....</li>
      <li>I have a thyroid condition which has caused my hair to start thinning on top.</li>
      <li>I would say try this for sure.</li>
      <li>I used Nioxin many many years ago</li>
      <li>It gives your hair volume and healthy look</li>
      <li>I gave it a three star rating because I am still trying to find the balance to maintain healthy manageable hair without washing it every day.</li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t do any better than Nioxin.  </li>
      <li>I had the 4 kit before (it tingled and smelled minty), but my hair more closely matches the 5 description</li>
      <li>Please make sure that you&#x27;re not allergic to any of the ingredients before you use these products and use with caution.</li>
      <li>But I can tell you have to stay with it to see more results</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>They must have really changed whatever it was that they were doing, because this stuff doesn&#x27;t have the nice minty smell and it leaves my hair looking greasy!</li>
      <li>the only thing good about it is that it smells good...</li>
      <li>Nevertheless this product yields True Results!</li>
      <li>She has a condition that causes buildup on her scalp after 48 hours and the 3 step Nioxin process has made a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do not feel comfortable to recieve cortisone shot or any streroid at all.</li>
      <li>Now I am using the clarifying shampoo coupled with a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>And this price is great especially when compared to what I used to pay at the hair salon for it.</li>
      <li>and so far so good.  </li>
      <li>So far so good...  </li>
      <li>Loved the first use made my hair feel stronger very clean, soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>and I used it for a week and the first thing i noticed was that i was loosing incredibly more hair throughout that week...</li>
      <li>clean and fresh&lt;br /&gt;Decreases</li>
      <li>I continue to use the shampoo as I&#x27;m going for a clean scalp.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re supposed to use the three products when you clean your hair.  </li>
      <li>hair loss&lt;br /&gt;Scalp feels clean and not irritated</li>
      <li>I moved the final spray solution into my own mist bottle which works better in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>Not the original formula...used to tingle and leave your scalp feeling cool, clean and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>I have tried thickening shampoos, special oil shampoos, spray in thickening products, etc.</li>
      <li>This has completely stopped the breakage and my hair feels and looks amazing.</li>
      <li>the shampoo is still 75% full.  </li>
      <li>It would be good for occasional use.  </li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good hair growth product</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>It leaves my scalp pleasantly tingling, but not painfully burning like other products.</li>
      <li>I tried this kit for the first time yesterday and I&#x27;m a believer after just one use!</li>
      <li>This is such a nice combo.  </li>
      <li>The scalp therapy works better as a hair conditioner than the old version did.</li>
      <li>Unsure if the product does what it says it does yet as far as thicker looking hair, but it does feel healthy.</li>
      <li>After using this shampoo and conditioner for the first time, my scalp, face and neck broke out in large, bright red blotches.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>Price was right.</li>
      <li>I went through the Nioxin product selector a number of times, varying the parameters, and always ended up with System 5, so I had the right one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been tested more than once with no other reactions.</li>
      <li>Excited to see the long term results :)</li>
      <li>really seems to assist with the thinning hair- be certain to go to the manufacturers web site to make sure you get the right system for your particular condition and hair</li>
      <li>I used to have very poofy and frizzy hair, but my hair is now much more tamed and soft since I&#x27;ve started using this.  </li>
      <li>I have curly hair and my previous conditioner could make it look pretty good.</li>
      <li>Bought my first batch on this site and then went to Sally Beauty and got a comparable product.</li>
      <li>Thinning seems to be improving, but I might upgrade to system 6 to see if the results are more obvious.  </li>
      <li>I also noticed that my scalp isn&#x27;t as oily as it usually is - which is awesome, because now I can usually go an extra day in between shampoos which is also helping heal my hair faster and saves a lot of time!</li>
      <li>First of all, let me clarify...</li>
      <li>I have noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>sure enough, it works!</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and smooth after washing it.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s working pretty well.</li>
      <li>Also made my scalp itchy during the first day after I wash my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using a different hair system bought from a salon, rather than online, and it works much better.</li>
      <li>It says on the website it&#x27;s normal to experience a little more hair loss for the first two week, but heck, mine lasted for 3 months!!!</li>
      <li>It requires a very little amount to get good coverage.</li>
      <li>pretty much how it was before she started the meds.</li>
      <li>satisfied and will keep using it as long as it keeps working.</li>
      <li>I had been taking an antibiotic that I believe was the catalyst for losing large amounts of hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find System 2 at the time.  Thought I&#x27;d try this, but it&#x27;s not even close to the same.  Guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a System 5.</li>
    <li> Cleans well and is odorless</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a hairdresser I visited while out of town to help with hair thinning due to hormonal changes.  I used it for a month and discontinued use because it turned my hair to straw.  It did not help the hair thinning problem, but one month may have been too short a time to see any improvement.  In any event, anything that made my hair, however little there is of it, look that bad was definitely not worth continuing.  I threw it away.  When I returned home my regular hairdresser was horrified I had used it and told me she would never recommend it and the other hairdressers in her shop agreed.</li>
    <li> I bought Nioxin Sys 5 from my hair salon for $44.  I bought the same system here for only $19 from Beauticonic!!  I will never buy Nioxin from my hair dresser again.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 days so far.  I like the shampoo and conditioner but wonder why they give us only 5oz for the conditioner.  The shampoo is 10oz and you&#x27;re supposed to use the three products when you clean your hair.  My conditioner is just about out yet the shampoo is still 75% full.  Either I use too much conditioner , which I don&#x27;t think I am, or it&#x27;s purposely a smaller quantity so that you&#x27;ll need to buy another system when the conditioner runs out.  The final step is to spray a vitamin mix onto the scalp.  The liquid comes out in a solid stream instead of a mist.  If you spray too much it will just drip off your head.  My complaints are the amount of conditioner supplied and the spray bottle.  I moved the final spray solution into my own mist bottle which works better in my opinion.  As far as my hair, I like the feel and shine since I&#x27;ve been using everything.  It&#x27;s hard to say for me if my hair is fuller since my latest hair cut was left a little longer, but two people have complemented on the look and feel of my hair..  I will use everything contained in the box and then decide if I will continue.  The whole idea of this system is to promote hair growth which after 30 days might be difficult to judge since my hair will grow regardless if I use this system or not.  I&#x27;ll likely ask people close to me what they think after the 30 days.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year, and my hair has become stronger. I will keep buying this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been only using this system now for awhile and so far so good.  I read it takes a good month before your hair appears thicker or at least I think that&#x27;s what it said.  It is better than other products I&#x27;ve been using so I&#x27;m going to stick with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin products for many years and find this newest product to be an excellent improvement over the older versions. It requires a very little amount to get good coverage. The scalp therapy works better as a hair conditioner than the old version did.</li>
    <li> Very good product and price</li>
    <li> I am 54 and living in the desert. This system has taken my hair from being dry and dull to healthy, thick and shiny. And my scalp no longer itches with dryness. I get so many compliments on my hair now! And this price is great especially when compared to what I used to pay at the hair salon for it.</li>
    <li> If you are worried about your hair or scalp you can&#x27;t do any better than Nioxin.  This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is really strong and cleaned my hair too well, making it dry.  It would be good for occasional use.  The conditioner is excellent and not greasy at all, I&#x27;d recommend it.  The scalp treatment made my hair fuller because it dried it out so much, it stood straight up, not recommended.  I went through the Nioxin product selector a number of times, varying the parameters, and always ended up with System 5, so I had the right one.</li>
    <li> The product has worked fairly well. I still feel my hair falls a lot but not as much before starting the product.</li>
    <li> After using it for about 6 months, my hairdresser whom I had not seen in a year noticed an increase in hair.&lt;br /&gt;Product  seems to works well.</li>
    <li> To be totally honest, I am not sure this is working. Bought my first batch on this site and then went to Sally Beauty and got a comparable product. I feel like maybe slightly less hair falls out when I wash or brush it, but I do not think it is growing faster by any means.</li>
    <li> sorry- this did not perform as advertised for me.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Not only is my hair fuller but it is at it&#x27;s healthiest. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good hair growth product</li>
    <li> everything came as expected.....</li>
    <li> Diagoised with Hashimoto&#x27;s hypothyroidism and was losing more hair (mostly noticed in the shower when I wash my hair - I count the number of strands in the hair collector in the shower to keep track of progress). I used this alternately with a ketoconazole shampoo (for hair regrowth prescribed by a dermatologist) for 3 months. Noticed more hair loss than before. Also made my scalp itchy during the first day after I wash my hair. It says on the website it&#x27;s normal to experience a little more hair loss for the first two week, but heck, mine lasted for 3 months!!! After switching back to my original cheapo suave clarifying shampoo, I almost immediately saw less hair in the shower. Now I am using the clarifying shampoo coupled with a sulfate free shampoo. I am not saying there might not be outside factors that influenced the hair loss. But I&#x27;m not sure if I am going to give Nioxin a try in the near future.</li>
    <li> I have just recently start using this product over the last 3 weeks and think it may be too early to see any progress.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me clarify... I am not allergic to anything but dust mites... I&#x27;ve been tested more than once with no other reactions. However, after my very first use of these three products (cleanser, scalp treatment, and scalp therapy), I noticed my shoulders, arms, forehead, and chest were covered with hives, and there were a few on my stomach as well. I was itchy and irritated! I have never reacted to anything like this before... not fabric softener, laundry detergent, lotion, soap, perfume, etc... so this was a major shock for me! I was extremely disappointed that these products caused such a reaction. I was looking forward to having thicker, stronger hair. However, sadly, I will not have such hair by use of these products. I will just let my hair grow naturally and hope that it will work out in the end.</li>
    <li> I used Nioxin many many years ago &amp; I loved the way it made my hair feel! They must have really changed whatever it was that they were doing, because this stuff doesn&#x27;t have the nice minty smell and it leaves my hair looking greasy! As a matter of fact, I think I will ask for a refund! I&#x27;ll never use it again!</li>
    <li> I have literally used this product only twice since receiving it, so I can&#x27;t say how well it works yet.  But, I have noticed that it works well, in that I don&#x27;t lose as much hair as with other shampoos.  My hair feels soft and smooth after washing it. I got the product very quickly and in good condition, so I would say the seller was very good.</li>
    <li> Have been using Nioxin for approximately 11 months. After about 6 months saw a noticeable difference with additional hair growth. Use this at least twice a week and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I stopped using this product....i though that maybe because i&#x27;m spending so much it&#x27;s going to be a quality product.....and I used it for a week and the first thing i noticed was that i was loosing incredibly more hair throughout that week...but i was like it&#x27;s probably the process of how it works...i used it for two more weeks....exactly as directed (i even watched the tutorials online) and i kept loosing the same amount of hair which was like 4x as much as what i used to loose when i used selsum blue.....so i stopped using it completely for about a week...started loosing less hair now....and i tried using at least just the conditioner and it made me loose hair again...so i was like screw this $20 POS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and now it&#x27;s sitting in my bathroom collecting dust...total waste of money.  the only thing good about it is that it smells good...but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really too soon to see any difference yet, although the first time I used it I did lose a lot less hair.  Lots of lather with shampoo and leaves my hair feeling great, but so did my last shampoo.  I&#x27;ve got my fingers crossed that it will ease my hair loss, but I think it&#x27;s Mother Natures way.  In any event, I will order again hoping for great results.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this and she has very curly hair.  It seemed help by strengthening her hair.  She really liked the leave in spray. Shipped on Time.</li>
    <li> I am working on a thinning issue with my hair. Only time will tell if this is worth it. Hope it does the trick.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time. This product delivers what it says it does. My hair has gotten thicker in one month. I have to stop using it in between so that my have does not get to thick. Overall would recommend to all</li>
    <li> Nioxin seems to have strengthened my hair and I also like that it doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals. My hair feels much healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the system for a few weeks and so far I can&#x27;t tell a difference. But at it we shall keep, hopefully with lea jumpers along the way.</li>
    <li> Almost done with my 4 weeks and have made good progress and have great results so far. Hoping to buy more!</li>
    <li> Unsure if the product does what it says it does yet as far as thicker looking hair, but it does feel healthy.</li>
    <li> So I had an allergic reaction to it, I got red blotches on my arms as a result of using this. My hair didn&#x27;t grow back fuller or anything. I used it for about a month and I will never again purchase this. Not worth the price. Also, even if I didn&#x27;t have such a bad experience with it, it really isn&#x27;t a good value in terms of how much product you get in the bottles.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Price was right. I can see and feel the difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have a thyroid condition which has caused my hair to start thinning on top. I have long, thick hair but seeing a bit of scalp really bothered me. I have tried thickening shampoos, special oil shampoos, spray in thickening products, etc. I came across Nioxin and I liked the fact that there were different formulas for different hair types and varying degrees of hair loss. No &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;. I chose No. 5 for my slightly thinning, coarse and color treated hair. I only need to wash my hair once a week so have only used it twice so far but I can tell the difference. Especially using the Therapy spray all over my scalp (I lift up sections and spray along the roots) before blow drying. This tends to rough up the roots so that they appear fuller and cover more. I sometimes use the Therapy spray on dry hair before styling, making sure to rub it in and fluff the hair to help it dry before teasing and putting on hair spray. I like this product and will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> The shamoo requires only one wash and rinse. My hair isn&#x27;t falling but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s growing back either. The products make the hair thicker so I guess I don&#x27;t notice the thinning so much. I gave it a three star rating because I am still trying to find the balance to maintain healthy manageable hair without washing it every day.</li>
    <li> first time i tried it i get  a bad red line on my face because my hair was touching my face it took me all day with hot face and that big red mark on my face  ... PS: i have never had any product&#x27;s allergy till this weird product i regret spending my money on it</li>
    <li> I dont feel any tingle? Do they leave that ingredient out of 5?  I had the 4 kit before (it tingled and smelled minty), but my hair more closely matches the 5 description... 4 has a mousse for the final step and 5 has a scalp Tx spray.  No tingle, but it might still be working for hair loss-my bald spot doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting worse ...or better .</li>
    <li> I used to have very poofy and frizzy hair, but my hair is now much more tamed and soft since I&#x27;ve started using this.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that I am not losing as much hair.  As for additional hair growth, I can&#x27;t really tell.  Overall, I would recommend this product, and buying it online is much cheaper than buying it at the store.</li>
    <li> I get this all the time, it works GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this from couple of years,I trust this product. Takes care of my hair in all seasons.</li>
    <li> i was recommanded this through a friend. I have aoreta apolecia pretty bad. I do not feel comfortable to recieve cortisone shot or any streroid at all. This shampoo really makes my hair stronger and helps with it not breaking, but unfortunately I still have spots where hair wont grow. I will try other products also</li>
    <li> Not the original formula...used to tingle and leave your scalp feeling cool, clean and refreshed.  Not anymore....also has a medicinal fragrance.  It may still have the same therapeutic properties but I&#x27;m choosing something else.</li>
    <li> One of the problems with this package was that the conditioner was almost half empty when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scalp treatment makes my skin (area around where hair grows, and my hands) blush and get very red when I massage it on my scalp. I have curly hair and my previous conditioner could make it look pretty good. After applying all these three products, they give me frizzy hair. I like the shampoo though.</li>
    <li> Head definitely feels and smells cleaner at any given time.  Thinning seems to be improving, but I might upgrade to system 6 to see if the results are more obvious.  Good product.</li>
    <li> it really does slow hair loss. i stopped using it 2 times and both times the hair loss increased dramatically.</li>
    <li> My mothers a hair stylist and has always reccomended this product for people that want longer, thicker hair. I just wish we could get bigger bottles, cheaper</li>
    <li> really seems to assist with the thinning hair- be certain to go to the manufacturers web site to make sure you get the right system for your particular condition and hair</li>
    <li> This is such a nice combo.  It really brings your hair to life. Makes it really soft &amp; easier to style. Even if you are not losing any hair, it is a great product !</li>
    <li> Step 3 doesn&#x27;t smell very good and I always smell it on me when I am working out. Also, I have been using it for the last few weeks and have not seen much results... I&#x27;m hoping that will change soon...</li>
    <li> Worked the 1st time I uses it. Noticed less and less  hair falling out with each use. I am on chemo infusions and had 8 surgeries in 7 months and saved hair I had and slowly growing back and stI&#x27;ll on my yinfusions. Yeah!</li>
    <li> My hair sylist told me about this product and it is rare theyhave this specific one in the beauty supply store. I have noticed a difference after the first use. But I can tell you have to stay with it to see more results</li>
    <li> Every since I was a child I had a relaxer. As I age my hair started to then out mainly the edges. I decided to go natural to see if my hair would thicken back up. Within a month of using Nioxin my edges are filling back in. Nioxin is the only product that has worked. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working pretty well. Doesn&#x27;t leave residue, and hair loss has slowed since i stopped using other products and started using this.The scent took some time to get used to though</li>
    <li> The system is really easy to use and the entire kit lasted me about a month and a half.  I&#x27;m a 25 year old male and I have fairly short hair.  Great as a starter kit to see how it works on your hair but I personally recommend shopping around on amazon and getting the litter sizes (and the bigger size for the Scalp Therapy) as they last a whole lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my hair is thickening.  I have noticed a little fill in where I was starting to loose hair in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied and will keep using it as long as it keeps working.</li>
    <li> Works amazing. Everyone is complementing me on how shiny and thicker my hair is! I have a thousand layers of hair from bleaching it too much and the breakage was unreal. This has completely stopped the breakage and my hair feels and looks amazing. This will be my shampoo for life!</li>
    <li> I tried this kit for the first time yesterday and I&#x27;m a believer after just one use! I can already see a big difference! My hair looks and feels thicker and fuller. Excited to see the long term results :)</li>
    <li> Loved the first use made my hair feel stronger very clean, soft and manageable.  Still thinning but hoping that stops soon.  Also found my color lasted longer as well</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I had postpartum hair loss about 2 months after I gave birth. It REALLY gave my hair a thicker appearance and strengthened my hair at a very scary time!! I got through it and now still use Nioxin... My only (small) complaint would be that the scalp therapy conditioner is too small. Wish it was larger so it could last as long as the shampoo. Nevertheless this product yields True Results!</li>
    <li> Not only did my hair loss seem to subside (maybe would have anyway), but it left my hair soft and healthy, but not too heavy or flat.</li>
    <li> I tried the product for 3 months and did not see a hint of difference. All products are not for everyone. I recommend that you try the product to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> My hair looks fuller and shinny love this item.  If you want fuller looking hair I think you should try this.</li>
    <li> I have dry and color treated hair and I can accumulate a nice handful of locks during shower. I noticed difference after using these 3 products after the second time. Less hair are falling out during shower and around the house. I switch between this system and regular shampoo since this is fairly expensive for the amount I get.</li>
    <li> Seems to be healing my scalp and stopping hair loss. I&#x27;ve been using the system for 2months and will continue.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife b/c she was losing hair due to her medicine the doctor prescribed, her hair stylist told her to buy it and sure enough, it works! Her hair loss has stopped and it looks a lot thicker now, pretty much how it was before she started the meds. I would say try this for sure. I just had to order more b/c she swears by it now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the system for a few weeks now. Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the amount of hair that comes out in the shower. It seems to be the same. I don&#x27;t find the conditioner to be very conditioning. My hair feels rather rough after using the shampoo. I&#x27;m going to give it a few more weeks to see if there&#x27;s any difference.</li>
    <li> this product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo and conditioner for the first time, my scalp, face and neck broke out in large, bright red blotches. I do not have allergies so I was shocked to see this reaction. Please make sure that you&#x27;re not allergic to any of the ingredients before you use these products and use with caution. Perhaps test products before you shampoo/condition.</li>
    <li> It fully meets my expectations. I ordered it by a recommendation of my hairdresser. Now I&#x27;m going to use it permanently. But bigger bottles will be required. It is a good option just to try the system.</li>
    <li> So far so good...  I got it quicker than I thought and it is doing what it says.  I don&#x27;t se growth yet but my hair feels fuller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin before and the ones I bought on Amazon did not feel the same as the salon bought ones. I continued to give it a try anyways; about two weeks into it, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. The shampoo and conditioner did not smell very good, not the way it used to anyways. I also noticed a change in the quality, it&#x27;s just not the same. I guess if it works for you, that&#x27;s great, but it did not work for me. I&#x27;m using a different hair system bought from a salon, rather than online, and it works much better. I feel like I wasted money buying Nioxin online; I will no longer be purchasing hair products online.</li>
    <li> AWESOME! NO HAIR FALLING IN THE BATHTUB</li>
    <li> This product was the worst I have tried on my hair. I purchased this kit because I read it would grow and thicken your hair. It did the opposite to mines.</li>
    <li> I had been taking an antibiotic that I believe was the catalyst for losing large amounts of hair. I also regularly get blonde highlights and have naturally coarse, thick, long hair that can tend to get dry due to processing &amp; flat ironing. The combination of losing hair (pretty much the worst thing that can happen to a person looks-wise) and the dry/damaged issue got me pretty depressed. I started using Nioxin about 2.5 weeks ago and have noticed a dramatic improvement in the texture and health of my hair. It&#x27;s MUCH healthier and looks shiny and thick. I used to have a lot of breakage and lots of small, broken off hairs on my counter. Now, those are totally GONE. No more breakage at all. I also noticed that my scalp isn&#x27;t as oily as it usually is - which is awesome, because now I can usually go an extra day in between shampoos which is also helping heal my hair faster and saves a lot of time! This is the first product that I&#x27;ve ever used that has made an impact on my scalp - which I can only assume means that the product is doing its job and treats the source of the issue (scalp health and balance) that produces great looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed a decrease in hair loss (but this is medication related, so I can&#x27;t imagine that a shampoo/conditioner could rectify that issue?) I am now off the antibiotics, so I&#x27;m hoping that the hair loss will subside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used pretty much every expensive, professional hair product at my salon - Schwartzkopf, MoroccanOil, Nuema, etc. and there is nothing that holds a candle to Nioxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the conditioner bottle is TINY in this kit and am already running low after a couple of weeks. Long, damaged, coarse hair requires more conditioner! The manufacturer of Nioxin should consider making the conditioner the same size as the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly because I have a problem scalp (tend to get a lot of build up, itchy), not because I am experiencing hair loss. But I do want to note that the clump of hair in the drain is noticeably smaller, about half the size or even smaller. I like the fact that it was designed to treat the scalp and the hair. Both are clean, moisturized and happy. As an added bonus my hair texture looks shiny and smooth (vs. dry and frizzy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair soft&lt;br /&gt;Texture is smoother (vs. frizzy)&lt;br /&gt;Smells clean and fresh&lt;br /&gt;Decreases hair loss&lt;br /&gt;Scalp feels clean and not irritated&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well&lt;br /&gt;Designed for the scalp and the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cost&lt;br /&gt;Takes a lot of time to rinse the conditioner (I&#x27;m lazy)</li>
    <li> I have had good results with Nioxin in the past and wanted a new supply. The price was great and although I was afraid I would get an open box, the package arrived plastic wrapped so I new it was new. Will order again.</li>
    <li> i started loosing hair, it was very bad, and i was desperate. i tried a lot of different products until somebody recommended me this (#5 works best for me) treatment system. It was impossible to admit, but had actual results after 2 times of using it! It gives your hair volume and healthy look right away.&lt;br /&gt;Now, i only use this Kit. Nothing else works with me. But it is essential to use all three products together.</li>
    <li> My sister and I have notoriously dry scalps, we both also have very thick hair. At my last cut &amp; color session my stylist (who also has really thick hair) said she uses Nioxin once a week to clean her scalp. With that recommendation I set out to find a product that works for me. Unfortunately, the product descriptions are hard to apply when I don&#x27;t have excessively thinning hair. Based on best guess I went with System 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;Oh my cats! My hair hates the shampoo. I immediately feel like I&#x27;ve turned my waist length curly hair into a straw bale. I continue to use the shampoo as I&#x27;m going for a clean scalp. It works, but I have to be excessively careful not to over scrub or I tear out an incredible amount of hair while working all of the tangles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing! My hair adores the conditioner, and a shockingly SMALL amount is needed to completely condition. I do let it sit on my scalp for 3 minutes as suggested on the bottle. It leaves my scalp pleasantly tingling, but not painfully burning like other products. It also has a slightly peppermint smell that I find pleasing as well.  For all the trials that I go through with the shampoo, the conditioner is my reward. If my scalp is feeling especially dry (I&#x27;m a swimmer and am in chlorinated water many hours a week), I let the conditioner sit an extra minute, and the itchiness is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave in scalp treatment:&lt;br /&gt;It works. The biggest CON however is the smell! I can only use the scalp treatment every other week. I often wind up with headaches because I can&#x27;t abide the scent. My sister however doesn&#x27;t struggle with it, and we use the treatment every time for her. She has a condition that causes buildup on her scalp after 48 hours and the 3 step Nioxin process has made a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Keeps scalp clean&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes dandruff&lt;br /&gt;Stops Itching&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner does its job exceptionally well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo can cause excessive tangling&lt;br /&gt;Smell of leave in scalp treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will continue to use the product for the foreseeable future, it&#x27;s making a positive impact for us.</li>
