      <li>Love it, has good tension, doesn&#x27;t tangle, is lightweight, works on a lot of hair types.</li>
      <li>It adds a nice polish to my hair.</li>
      <li>My old stylist used them and told me about how awesome they are and I had no choice but to purchase one after seeing the results.  </li>
      <li>It is incredibly lightweight which makes it a great brush for us gals with long hair who require 15+ minutes to blowdry.  </li>
      <li>The cork handles make these very light weight.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very light.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Is comfortable for client!</li>
      <li>Love love love this brush.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
      <li>My hair likes this brush a lot better that my plastic-bristled drugstore brushes.</li>
      <li>can anyone recommend a better brush.</li>
      <li>it is static electricity.</li>
      <li>Its great for coarse hair, it has good grip.</li>
      <li>The brush is ultra light weight, and hence very easy to hold.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect size for me to create smooth sleek hair with a tiny twist at the end.</li>
      <li>Although I live in Prague, delivery was fantastic, got it within 10 days!!!</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and it well constructed.</li>
      <li>I have curlier, fine hair</li>
      <li>have fine hair now.</li>
      <li>This brush makes it sleek and frizz free.</li>
      <li>cause it sturdy and comfortable to use</li>
      <li>(Which btw, I purchased a cheap replacement in the week</li>
      <li>As a hairstylist I find these brushes indispensable.</li>
      <li>Since my old one is still in good condition, I&#x27;ll just hang with it and return this one.</li>
      <li>Because they are light, they don&#x27;t fall out of my hair as I&#x27;m waiting for them to cool.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with large barrel metal brushes -</li>
      <li>It is a good brush like for ten dollars</li>
      <li>I think the price would have been justified had the size been right for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also considering purchasing the large round brush, however am in no rush since I am very happy with the medium brush.  </li>
      <li>Professional finish.&lt;br /&gt;Would absolutely recommend- a good value for the money.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t go as far as to say that it is the reason my hair is shinier and healthier as I have upgraded to a nice blowdryer and several great hair products all around the same time I got my Ibiza, but I can&#x27;t really discredit it either.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful brush, the price doesn&#x27;t bother me if it works but for my thick, wavy hair, it just didn&#x27;t work for blowdrying.</li>
      <li>Assuming this lasts for a good long while, I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Keeps had soft and shiny and the grip makes it easy to separate the strands and not get all tangled</li>
      <li>Very light and glides down hair easily.</li>
      <li>Lightweight, pretty, easy to use and hold above the head.</li>
      <li>First i ordered the blonde bristles for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>and I should have bought the large brush.</li>
      <li>After drying my hair initially, I use them as large curlers, winding a section around the brush and rolling it to the scalp, hitting it with hot air from the blowdryer, then leaving them in to cool.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money, but the improvement is noticeable.</li>
      <li>Dosen&#x27;t pull out your hair and really hold the hair while you  are drying it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still learning to use it, but it really does make a difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
      <li>Nice looking brush but bristles are too stiff.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brush.  </li>
      <li>though she doesn&#x27;t normally care about hair products, she loves the brush too.  </li>
      <li>At first, you&#x27;re like, how can a single brush cost so much?  </li>
      <li>I hesitated to spend this much money on a brush, but I have no regrets.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure your hair is about 70% dry before you start to use the brush to complete your blow dry and style.</li>
      <li>Well let me tell you this brush is worth every single penny.  </li>
      <li>All natural bristles.</li>
      <li>The bristles have just enough pull on them so your hair doesn&#x27;t slip out when you are blowdrying from root to end, but not too much to the point where you are yanking your hair out from the brush.  </li>
      <li>but worth every dollar I spent.</li>
      <li>It is horribly stiff and nothing smooth about using it.</li>
      <li>I purchased the brush last week, and received it today- before Christmas, and after emailing in to request an address change (as Amazon had auto-selected my old address.)    </li>
      <li>Much worse than my cheap old 60% boar</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush and Ibiza brushes in general.  </li>
      <li>The brush bristles are firm with out being hard and is easy on my sensitive scalp.</li>
      <li>A little expensive but superior to the cheaper brushes.  </li>

<li> And then, sadly, when I left my brush at the gym-</li>
<li> It is a bit expensive (especially with all added costs, wat, customs etc)</li>
<li> the barrel on this is too small and my hair just gets tangled in this thing.</li>
<li> Dense bristles make it hard to grip my wavy hair.  </li>
<li> and the comb is hard.</li>
<li> All in all, I have tossed my DryBar brush aside (and it was expensive too!), and only use this one.  </li>
<li> I have medium length layered hair that is medium thickness and has subtle ombre.</li>
<li> Had a terrible hair day after using this and sent it back.</li>
<li> Expensive</li>
<li> I recommend the company and the product to anyone who comments on my hair or asks me why I was so sad to lose a hair brush.</li>
<li> I just couldn&#x27;t believe how horrible it was to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I saw this brush on the website for beautydepartment.com...they suggested it for bangs and it works like a charm! Love it</li>
    <li> ibiza brushes are my favorites! being a hair dresser i go through alot of brushes but i always go back to ibiza! great quality</li>
    <li> Nice looking brush but bristles are too stiff. Feels like it is pulling at my hair with each application.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair now. Maybe this brush should be recommended for youth with very thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Easy to break it and great, glossy, hair from the taught construct of the bristles. The handle is easy to hold and there is not a connection point at the base so hair does not get tangled when blowing hair out.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brush, the price doesn&#x27;t bother me if it works but for my thick, wavy hair, it just didn&#x27;t work for blowdrying. I&#x27;ve had better luck with large barrel metal brushes - the barrel on this is too small and my hair just gets tangled in this thing. Had a terrible hair day after using this and sent it back.</li>

Because they are light, they don&#x27;t fall out of my hair as I&#x27;m waiting for them to cool.  They don&#x27;t get tangled in the hair, and leave a great wave.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer of Ibiza hair brushes.  My old stylist used them and told me about how awesome they are and I had no choice but to purchase one after seeing the results.  Since then, my bangs have been well behaved.  I bought one for my mom for mother&#x27;s day; though she doesn&#x27;t normally care about hair products, she loves the brush too.  And then, sadly, when I left my brush at the gym- I knew I had to replace the brush immediately.  I purchased the brush last week, and received it today- before Christmas, and after emailing in to request an address change (as Amazon had auto-selected my old address.)    I recommend the company and the product to anyone who comments on my hair or asks me why I was so sad to lose a hair brush. (Which btw, I purchased a cheap replacement in the week I was out a round brush, and now I have a cheap gym brush I can leave behind without being sad...)    LOVE THIS BRUSH and excellent excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Love! Very light and glides down hair easily. It adds a nice polish to my hair.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this brush.  A little expensive but superior to the cheaper brushes.  Dosen&#x27;t pull out your hair and really hold the hair while you  are drying it.</li>
    <li> I have a couple of these brushes in different sizes. I got the largest one first thinking it was best because that is what was used on me at a salon and she obviously has blow drying talents I&#x27;ve yet to obtain. This is the perfect size for me to create smooth sleek hair with a tiny twist at the end. I have medium length layered hair that is medium thickness and has subtle ombre. This brush makes it sleek and frizz free. It takes some time to master using a round brush and especially one with mostly natural bristles. I would never use another brush for blow drying. Just make sure your hair is about 70% dry before you start to use the brush to complete your blow dry and style. Recommend the EX3 vs. larger for those wanting to hone their skills before going bigger!</li>
    <li> Could somebody please tell me how to use this brush. It is horribly stiff and nothing smooth about using it. I don&#x27;t get it when the stylist at high-end salon used it, I couldn&#x27;t believe the blowout..How do you get the results everyone talks about???? It&#x27;s there a method to use this brush? First i ordered the blonde bristles for my fine hair. I just couldn&#x27;t believe how horrible it was to use. So, i thought it must be that I didn&#x27;t use this black bristle brush, the same one stylist used in salon. can anyone recommend a better brush. thank you</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist I find these brushes indispensable. I have all the sizes and would recommend them to any other stylist or for individual usage.</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush.  Best there is! !</li>
    <li> Pros: 1. The brush is ultra light weight, and hence very easy to hold. 2. It is made of boar bristles, which softens hair.  Cons: 1. Because the brush has cork where bristles are attached, I struggle to get my hair to glide, so I end up pulling, and pulling, which hurts, and pulls out hair. 2. My hair gets tangled when I try to glide.  3. Dense bristles make it hard to grip my wavy hair.  4. Expensive</li>
    <li> it is static electricity. But the quality is really good.  my hair can not be twined around it.  and the comb is hard.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to spend this much money on a brush, but I have no regrets.  The bristles are excellent and the light weight provided by the easy-to-grasp cork handle makes using it a pleasure.  Assuming this lasts for a good long while, I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is a good brush like for ten dollars but it&#x27;s not by no means a sixty dollars brush</li>
    <li> Saw this in a magazine. Lightweight, pretty, easy to use and hold above the head. The bristles do seem to help make hair a bit shinier.</li>
    <li> Keeps had soft and shiny and the grip makes it easy to separate the strands and not get all tangled up.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a professional quality brush that should last a long time, unfortunately it is not as large in the center as I needed. I have curlier, fine hair and I should have bought the large brush. The brush bristles are firm with out being hard and is easy on my sensitive scalp. It is easy to use and it well constructed. I only wish I had bought the larger one. I think the price would have been justified had the size been right for me. Still it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush and Ibiza brushes in general.  At first, you&#x27;re like, how can a single brush cost so much?  Well let me tell you this brush is worth every single penny.  It is incredibly lightweight which makes it a great brush for us gals with long hair who require 15+ minutes to blowdry.  The bristles have just enough pull on them so your hair doesn&#x27;t slip out when you are blowdrying from root to end, but not too much to the point where you are yanking your hair out from the brush.  I won&#x27;t go as far as to say that it is the reason my hair is shinier and healthier as I have upgraded to a nice blowdryer and several great hair products all around the same time I got my Ibiza, but I can&#x27;t really discredit it either.  All in all, I have tossed my DryBar brush aside (and it was expensive too!), and only use this one.  I&#x27;m also considering purchasing the large round brush, however am in no rush since I am very happy with the medium brush.  They are incredible!</li>
    <li> My hair likes this brush a lot better that my plastic-bristled drugstore brushes. I&#x27;m still learning to use it, but it really does make a difference in the texture of my hair. I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money, but the improvement is noticeable. I have gray, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Love it, has good tension, doesn&#x27;t tangle, is lightweight, works on a lot of hair types. Is comfortable for client!</li>
    <li> Great handle that doesn&#x27;t slip around. All natural bristles. Professional finish.&lt;br /&gt;Would absolutely recommend- a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. Although I live in Prague, delivery was fantastic, got it within 10 days!!! It is a bit expensive (especially with all added costs, wat, customs etc) but worth every dollar I spent. It makes my hair shiny and sliky and  does no damage to the hairs. I will never use any other brush.  I would apreciate if there is an option to purchase Ibiza products in Europe.</li>
    <li> It should be around only 30% boar and it stucks and creates statics. Much worse than my cheap old 60% boar but I could not find it in stores anymore. The only things I like is its design and it&#x27;s very light. Since my old one is still in good condition, I&#x27;ll just hang with it and return this one.</li>
    <li> Brush is good for hair that has layers</li>
    <li> I like this brush cause it sturdy and comfortable to use but you need to break it in. Its great for coarse hair, it has good grip.</li>
