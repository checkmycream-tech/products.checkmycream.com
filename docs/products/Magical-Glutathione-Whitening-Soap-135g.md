      <li>Perfect service from this seller!</li>
      <li>but Im happy with my results.</li>
      <li>I loved the customer service as well.</li>
      <li>Smells ok but doesn&#x27;t do anything magical for the skin</li>
      <li>No change and broke out even more.</li>
      <li>I love this soap, I use it for my whole body, it is great for exfoliation the skin.</li>
      <li>The magical glutathione soap creates a brightening effect on skin,like a shimmer.</li>
      <li>I used this soap while amonth , I note my skin start lighter and soft , good stuff .</li>
      <li>The soap makes you feel really clean, and softens your skin.</li>
      <li>The soap is mild but POTENT,so begin lightly,leave on for around 3 minutes and rinse off.</li>
      <li>This product really does work very quickly.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first week and it has changed my color a tone lighter.</li>
      <li>In a few days u&#x27;ll will start noticing ur skin tone its brighter and soft, by means that i didnt have to put some kind of moisturizer</li>
      <li>This bar of soap not only cleans, but clears any discoloration on you skin and keeps your face hydrates and vibrant.</li>
      <li>so putting that on your body every day i think is very good if you dont wanna catch a cold ever again!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had product allergy before, but I tested this over the period of 6 months to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else irritating my skin.</li>
      <li>All of these might indicated that they are reusing old boxes with, possibly, a knock off soap.</li>
      <li>at first, yes u will feel a sting of burn until ur skin will get use to it in a few days.</li>
      <li>I used it up in a couple of weeks but that was long enough for it to lighten my skin considerably.</li>

    <li> Smells ok but doesn&#x27;t do anything magical for the skin</li>
    <li> I used this soap while amonth , I note my skin start lighter and soft , good stuff . I&#x27;ll buy it again .</li>
    <li> The magical glutathione soap creates a brightening effect on skin,like a shimmer.The soap is mild but POTENT,so begin lightly,leave on for around 3 minutes and rinse off.I do  not use the soap on my face,I did try a small amount,and rinse off after 30 sec or so.You may feel some burning sensation on tender skin areas as the soap dries,,,rinse off well.&lt;br /&gt;  The soap does not cause me any rash or problem,I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt; If you are concerned about skin reaction to this product,test it out on your arms first,lightly.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, I use it for my whole body, it is great for exfoliation the skin.</li>
    <li> I noticed a bit of a difference but had to stop using it because it gave me a rash. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had product allergy before, but I tested this over the period of 6 months to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else irritating my skin. It wasn&#x27;t. If it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Came in with the soap box OPENED. Inspecting the box itself carefully, you will see that the box was REUSED. All of these might indicated that they are reusing old boxes with, possibly, a knock off soap. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> This bar of soap not only cleans, but clears any discoloration on you skin and keeps your face hydrates and vibrant.</li>
    <li> I used this soap for about 3 weeks and I notice a my skinned lightened about a shade. The soap doesnt last long unfortunately but Im happy with my results. It does burn a bit on my face but It helped lighten the sunburn I have on my African American skin. Im medium brown. I over all recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> Still giving it time to work  start using a week no change yet , i use twice a day  ,  will give a up date later .</li>
    <li> This product really does work very quickly. You will start to see results within a week! This product lightened my skin when other products failed to make a difference. The only problem is that the soap does not last long. I used it up in a couple of weeks but that was long enough for it to lighten my skin considerably.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this soap and used it..... It&#x27;s my first week and it has changed my color a tone lighter. I wonder what changes it will do for the next few weeks..and Im waiting for it to finish so I can buy another one!!!</li>
    <li> I only can say it works with no drying. I loved the customer service as well. I only wish it last a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God bless,&lt;br /&gt;K.M.</li>
    <li> Perfect service from this seller! After reading the other reviews i decided to buy a couple of soaps at once. I have used it for two weeks now, and gotten a little bit brighter, not so much i expected but it works alright. A plus is that it contains a lot of vitamin C, (almost stings a little bit) so putting that on your body every day i think is very good if you dont wanna catch a cold ever again! ;)</li>
    <li> The soap did not work for me. I used it twice daily and there was no difference noted. Will not buy next time.</li>
    <li> No difference. Was a waste of money and used for a month and just quit. No change and broke out even more. Kojie San works best</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any lighting. The soap lasted about two weeks. The soap makes you feel really clean, and softens your skin.</li>
    <li> at first, yes u will feel a sting of burn until ur skin will get use to it in a few days. I used it 2 times a day on my face washing it with cold water before going sleep and after i wake up. In a few days u&#x27;ll will start noticing ur skin tone its brighter and soft, by means that i didnt have to put some kind of moisturizer everytime i used it.</li>
    <li> Why did I get a likas soap?? I was expecting what was on the picture. Did everyone else get a likas papaya soap?? Havent tried it yet, will review again after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong soap at first, but the seller let me keep it and sent me the correct product as well. So I definitely appreciate the customer service and the products. I have been using this soap on my face since September. I have noticed a big difference in my skin, a lot of my blackheads have already faded away and my skin looks even.</li>
