<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> You definitely get bang for your buck with this sugar scrub. It is a decently sized tub of scrub and priced awesome. The scent is very sugary and sweet and it leaves great oils on your body that soak in so you can skip lotioning after the shower. The sugar also seems to melt right off your body so you don&#x27;t have to sit there scrubbing it all off before getting out. The sugar isn&#x27;t abrasive but still makes you feel super soft after the shower.</li>
    <li> This scrub smells amazing and leaves my skin so super soft and moisturized. A little bit of this product goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  It leaves my skin feeling so moisturized that I don&#x27;t even need lotion.  The moisture lasts through the next day.  It has a very pleasing scent that isn&#x27;t too heavy.  My husband has been using this on his eczema, and it has almost completely cleared it up.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I expected, except for the fact that it only lasted through about 10 showers--ran out quickly.  It is \\&quot;oily\\&quot;, which is what I was looking for.  I like the scrubbing factor, the scent, and the sheen that it put on my skin afterward.  However, it does not last long at all. Will not be re-purchasing for that reason.</li>
    <li> First of all the smell is intoxicating.  The application is not severely rough on your skin, but it is just harsh enough to where you can really feel a difference afterwards.  The scrub leaves my skin extremely soft and moist, so there is no need to apply an additional layer of lotion.  This is def a long term product for me - I feel great after my first use and plan on using this weekly!</li>
    <li> Body scrub is amazing.  Leaves no residue in the shower and scrubs your dead cells away while leaving your skin super soft!</li>
    <li> This scrub is great. I was worried about using a scrub bc of my sensitive skin, but it leaves my skin smooth and moisturized. The ingredients are really great. The scrub smells pleasantly of sugar cane and isn&#x27;t super perfumed. My only complaint is that I wish it were a little bit more abrasive.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Body Polish\\&quot; is the right term: after using this my skin was as silky smooth. The sugar grains aren&#x27;t as abrasive as salt scrubs so obsessive exfoliators may think that it&#x27;s not working but wait until you rise and dry off. It&#x27;s comparable to L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s [[ASIN:B001U3745A Almond Delicious Paste]] that way--- another excellent gentle scrub, if pricier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alba products have always held the reputation for smelling heavenly and this sugar scrub is no different. It left my skin smelling soft the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting lotion on after a bath with this redundant (and a bit messy) as the natural oils from the polish are left on your skin. In any case, post-bath lotion is unnecessary unless you&#x27;re experiencing extreme weather conditions.</li>
    <li> The light honey smell is luscious and the sugar scrub is definitely exfoliating but not too harsh. I love it and bought 3 more runs!</li>
    <li> Smells great. I love it</li>
    <li> I typically use the body scrub before shaving (it just feels more of a smooth shave than doing the scrub after), and since the exfoliating ingredient is sugar, combined with the oils just makes it a really sticky shaving experience because it leaves a residue on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is good, smells great, and feels great, just not my thing. I bought this primarily because I couldn&#x27;t find my favorite brand of body scrub at Target. My favorite is the \\&quot;Boots Mediterranean Body Scrub - Almond Pistachio &amp; Olive\\&quot;. It gives me a super-exfoliating experience, and the exfoliant STAYS. With the Alba body scrub, since it&#x27;s sugar, it pretty much dissolves within seconds under the shower, which for me, is not that fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re the type of person who likes mild scrubs with an oilier base, this is a nice product. It feels good after you shower, the oils stay on your skin, and it smells mildly fruity. Otherwise, if you like a tougher scrub with a creamier base, get the Boots Mediterranean scrub I just mentioned.</li>
    <li> I put this on after I shave and it leaves my skin so smooth! I love how it is a bit grainy because I can feel it exfoliating my skin. It smells fabulous and I don&#x27;t have to use lotion after I get out of the shower!!! Just lovely, no complains!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best for my very dry legs and arms - the moisture stays with my skin for 2 days, even after a shower. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> This product is great! I will definitely purchase again.  It exfoliates and moisturizes as it should.  It has a nice smell.  After showering I do not need to follow up with another moisturizer and it leaves your skin smooth!</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. It has a sweet smell and it&#x27;s not a harsh scrub it&#x27;s gentle enough for me to use on my face. I use it on my face before I do a spray tan. As usual, Amazon ships fast and easy and always in great condition.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite shower scrubs.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells delicious, very \\&quot;scrubby\\&quot; (not just oil with a few beads) and doesn&#x27;t leave bits of this and that all over your tub.  I love it!  Feels so good and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This smells good but it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as well as other body scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past. But it does leave your skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have been using Arbonne ginger citrus sugar scrub. It&#x27;s very expensive and I was looking for a less expensive alternative. I was a little skeptical that it would work as well. I use it to shave with. WOW! I was pleasantly surprised. The alba body polish worked every bit as good for a fraction of the cost. I actually like it better. It doesn&#x27;t have so much oil that has to be blended every time you use it. The only down side is it doesn&#x27;t have the citrus fragrance I have come to love. I can definitely get past that and will be stocking up on this product.</li>
    <li> We have the Alba line at my place of employment,it us kind of expensive. So I decided to see if Amazon carried the line and they did and at a very reasonable price. So,I put the Alba Body Polish Sugar Cane on my Christmas List and received it. This stuff is awesome,together with the Coconut Body Cream. I would highly recommend this products.  I live where the winters are cold and these two products takes care of my itchy winter skin. Once again I would highly recommend both of these products. I plan on trying other Alba products. I will let everyone know,I am sure they are awesome.</li>
    <li> I like using Alba Body Polish after shaving my legs. It&#x27;s great for exfoliating and moisturizing. I also use it to exfoliate and moisture my arms.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting this magnitude of soft and silky, but WOW. I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my own legs after scrubbing them with this the first time! And the effects really last-- I use this polish in the morning (not everyday; every week or two and on special occasions) and I still feel like a seal (in a good way) by nightfall. I guess I was just expecting the usual scrub, exfoliating benefits, so I&#x27;m impressed. I take mini-handfuls in the bath and shower, and rub over my skin (away from the water at first, uh-duuh) in a circular motion, paying particular attention to such areas as the knees, elbows, ankles, all over the feet, shoulders and chest area. Your skin will be begging to be touched ;)</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Wish scrubbing beads were a little larger. Overall, nice. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> wonderful scent and texture makes my skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love using scrubs after I shave my legs but the salt ones sting. I tried a lot of sugar scrubs and they didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the salt ones ... Till I found this! Smells sweet and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth all day!</li>
    <li> Alba makes wonderful products and this is one of the Best! The scent is awesome and my skin feels really soft after I use it. I can&#x27;t live without it I hope they do not stop making it , it is one of the best body polishes money can buy.</li>
    <li> Smells great but it&#x27;s a little oily. Does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> This really clears up the KP on my arms, I noticed an extreme improvement after just 3 uses. WOW! I&#x27;ve tried tons of scrubs and nothing helps but this does. It&#x27;s a weird gel texture that once you rub in becomes scrubby and oily. You rinse it off and are left with a ton of oils that moisturize well. It smells like cookies, comes in a big jar for a decent price and most importantly it WORKS!</li>
    <li> Make it yourself using your choice of oil and sugar.</li>
    <li> I mainly bought this because other reviewers said it didn&#x27;t leave grit in the tub. I find that annoying and would just give my spouse something to gripe about if the tub isn&#x27;t scrubbed daily. Alba scrub doesn&#x27;t do that. I love how my skin feels moisturized after using this. I&#x27;m older with dry skin, and I need all the moisturizing I can get. I will definitely keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the salt scrub from this maker, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from the sugar scrub.  It is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is like walking into a bakery, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the sugar particles are abrasive enough to get a good scrub.  I have used this on my face, with no breakouts and I didn&#x27;t need to use lotion afterwards.  I don&#x27;t feel that this is excessively oily either.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely my new favorite scrub.</li>
    <li> This body polis is wonderful!!! As I exfoliate, the sugar melts and leaves my skin smelling yummy and moisturized to where I do NOT need a seperate moisturizer after I get out of the shower. So it&#x27;s a time saver too !</li>
    <li> I love this body scrub.  It has a very pleasant soft fragrance and smooths my skin.  I used to pay 3 times this amount for a similar scrub until I found this.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue in the tub either. I plan on buying several for Christmas gifts this year.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I wanted a body scrub that would leave my skin feeling soft and this one certainly does the job.  It has a pleasant sweet smell and is not too oily.</li>
    <li> To oily I do like this brand but found one I like better it did add moisture to my skin though.Just not for me.</li>
    <li> This actually really does clear up KP (keratosis pilaris) on my arms. I was pleasantly surprised at this feat since nothing else seems to work. I do wish the exfoliators - or the actual scrub bits of it - lasted longer, but otherwise I am pleased with my purchase. Compared to other scrubs it finds the right balance of oil - other scrubs usually leave residue and waxiness, this one does not.</li>
    <li> This scrub is absolutely &#x27;delicious&#x27; and leaves your skin smooth and hydrated.  I will definitely order again.  The aroma is to die for (if you like sweet - which I do).</li>
    <li> I used this in the shower. Putting it on is dreamy. It is the perfect texture for my somewhat sensitive skin. Loved that. But I was SOOO sticky going to bed after my shower. My legs were sticking together!!  I don&#x27;t like to go to bed sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, I might use it before the soap. That might work if I can wash it off . But, word to the wise, this is sticky stuff.</li>
    <li> Your body will truly feel well polished when using this scrub. It felt like a treat each time.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well for people of color as well as all skin types. You will feel like a new born baby.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice body polish!  I am a little picky about fragrances, and while this doesn&#x27;t smell as I hoped it would, it is very nice - kind of fresh, with a medium undertone of vanilla/powder (best I can describe it).  It is nice and gritty, and the suger crystals don&#x27;t dissolve TOO fast; rub gently and it feels soooo nice. I primarily use it on my arms, and do so in the sink to avoid any possibility of making the bathtub slippery,  It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily sheen on my skin, just the nice feel as if a separate lotion had been rubbed in (which you can do if you want, but isn&#x27;t necessary).  To sum up:  Very happy with this purchase and seller, and I intend to buy this item again!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff. Excellent product and always leaves her silkly smooth</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> Love it. Went to a day spa and they used this and now I cannot have any other body scrub! Skin is soft, great for summer , happy purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time, although I have used scrubs before now. There are no microbeads in this, either.  It is so much nicer than the salt scrub they use at the salon when I get a pedicure.  After using this, my legs are so soft and smooth!  It smells pretty good.  I will most definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> perfect for foot scrubs....nice scent... mild, not over-powering</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think I would like it, but tried it and do. It is a great oil and leaves skin soft and smooth. Love the feel and smell of this.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a good scrub because I have really dry, flaky skin. It feels amazing! The scrub is not harsh at all, which is great for those who have sensitive skin such as myself. It moisturizes excellently and greatly helps to heal dry skin. And, although not meant for the face, I have tried a small amount on my face because I have some dry skin there as well. It feels great and isn&#x27;t harmful to the face at all! It also clears up and gently peels away any scabs if you have any. It makes my skin feel so refreshed and just like new! It also smells wonderful (kind of like sugar cookies lol). This is a really great buy! I totally recommend it! :D</li>
    <li> Im glad i received this .Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!! I have tried countless &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scrubs and even tried making my own but I was always disappointed. They would either irritate my skin or wouldn&#x27;t be quite &amp;#34;scruby&amp;#34; enough or they would reek of artificial perfumes. This stuff feels like a dream when you put it on and it&#x27;s the perfect amount of scrub. Never irritates my skin, ALWAYS leaves me feeling soft and smooth after my shower. Not to mention it smells amazing, like a tropical vacation in a tub. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of drugstore scrubs and this has been my favorite. The texture is almost gelly-like and really gritty - once you rub it into your skin the sugar dissipates and leaves a lot of oil behind (this is the moisturizing goodness you want to rub in well after rinsing a bit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use it on my arms and legs and they are so soft. It helps get rid of the red bumps on my arms and shaving bumps on my legs. It&#x27;s moisturizing so I don&#x27;t need to use a lotion after I get out of the shower which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not strong but it smells really sweet and kind of like cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice affordable body scrub.</li>
    <li> My skin is soooo soft after using this thanx :-) I will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I enjoy the scent, but the scrub is not very effective. It&#x27;s a very fine-grain scrub and it literally melts away as you rub it in- it just lathers up into a cream of sorts. It does *lightly* exfoliate, but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for- I wanted a scrub that would make a noticeable difference and give me a good exfoliation. I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent my wife loves</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product for a few reasons. I like to use natural products and the reviews on here lead me to believe that it would work in exfoliating as well as moisturizing. That is in fact the point of an in shower body scrub (exfoliating) right? Wrong. I saw no benefit to using this scrub. It leaves your skin oily, I would not call this moisturized, and I have skin that accumulates gunk very easily as I have naturally oily skin so for anyone who has similar skin I would skip out on this product and go for something natural that actually does the job. Additionally this actually has added to the issue of stuff being in my pores on my back and everywhere because of the \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; effect it has on the skin.</li>
    <li> it is not that great... i gave it 4 stars because it doesnt have bad side effect to senstive skin. im happy for that .&lt;br /&gt;To me ,it barelly have any scent  ,if i smell it hard ,it is like some old olive oil ...so i dont have good experience of the heaven-like scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt give a refresh feeling too ,its kind of oily ,but that is what does the moisturize job .i think this is a very common scrub ,i will try something else</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sugar scrubs. This is the best so far. The scent is candy sweet (not overbearing) and it has the right amount of oil so that your legs (or whatever) will not require lotion when you get out of the shower. Some may find it too oily, but I think it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviews that it smells and feels good, etc. The reason for my low rating is that, like one other reviewer commented, it leaves a thick coating not only on skin but also the shower floor. You cannot stand up in the shower after rinsing it off, which is very dangerous. I had to get out and finish shaving at the sink. The shower floor was still too slippery to stand up on even the next day. I cannot recommend this product unless you have a seat in your shower and are going to be sitting down the entire time, and you scrub your shower afterwards every single time. Even then I would not use it while home alone, in case of a fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: just adding that after 20 min scrubbing with a citrus degreaser the shower was still to slippery to use. Simple Green worked better, if that helps anyone.</li>
    <li> My skin is so dry. I use this all the time around Winter and it is AMAZING. Yes, leaves floor slippery so be very careful, but for my itchy skin to be nicely hydrated this is great product.</li>
    <li> I have used A TON of body scrubs. From regular old olive oil and sugar or salt to Tree Hut in every smell. This scrub lasts the longest, is thick and really makes you feel clean. It&#x27;s also perfect for exfoliation. I used it twice this weekend after being covered by mud at Lollapalooza 2012. This scrub not only made me feel like I finally cleaned inches of urine and poop infested mud. It&#x27;s also nourishing on your skin, leaving it perfect if you don&#x27;t like to put lotion on afterwards. Also unbelievable for self-tanning for the exfoliation and moisturizing reasons. A big score. Will buy bulk next time.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a product that smells gorgeous and doesn&#x27;t scrub your skin to within an inch of its life! Its perfect for those of us who prefer a gentle but effective product. Body polish is a very good description as it leaves skin soft and no need for moisturising afterwards. The smell is gorgeous and makes me wants to eat it! A huge plus for me is its a very natural product with no nasty preservatives etc. and also none of those harsh scrubby microparticles left in the bottom of your bath/shower. I need to buy this stuff in bulk! Perfect product...buy it now!</li>
    <li> Keeps skin feeling soft after a shower, love the light scent and does not irritate my skin!</li>
    <li> This was ok.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed by how greasy it was though.&lt;br /&gt;It had a very nice sweet scent...something unique (scent wise) but I could not stand the oiliness on the tub..&lt;br /&gt;not fun at all.&lt;br /&gt;Product was shipped to me very quickly though.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading customer reviews and I love it. It has a nice soft vanilla scent. It really is a body \\&quot;polish\\&quot; - it gently scrubs off dead skin and leaves you feeling soft and smooth. I have always had bumps on my arms and tried lots of different things to get rid of them. This scrub has almost completely eliminated the bumps! I also recommend using after shaving, because it leaves a light coating on the skin that moisturizes. BUT - Do not use on your face if you have oily skin.</li>
    <li> Nice product. I would prefer a bit more scrub, but it is nice and doesn&#x27;t bother me and I&#x27;m sensitive.</li>
    <li> It smells nice. It does the job. The container is generous. But I&#x27;ll probably try a different product next time, because I feel like there might be something better out there.</li>
    <li> One thing I love about sugar and salt scrubs is the oil base, which really moisturize my skin so I don&#x27;t have to use moisturizer.  This scrub does a great job at that.  The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the strong lemon smell, it almost smells like lemon pledge.  It also stings a little if you get it on a cut, which is a little weird.  I prefer Fresh&#x27;s Brown Sugar scrub (which is kind of expensive) or even Trader Joe&#x27;s Lavender Salt scrub, which is pretty cheap.  Or you can just make your own with sugar, oil and essential oils.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I&#x27;m allergic to a ton of items that are in most beauty products, but this scrub is awesome and I don&#x27;t get any bad reactions when I use it. It smells great. The sugar is much more gentle than salt scrubs.</li>
    <li> Alba scrub smells so good and I love the texture</li>
    <li> Love it. Feels and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> Only used it once, not sure if I like the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
