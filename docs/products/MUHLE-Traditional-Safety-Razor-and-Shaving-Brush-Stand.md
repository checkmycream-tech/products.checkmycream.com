### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>:-D</li>
      <li>Perfect gift for my husband!</li>
      <li>, the combination will probably be too beautiful to pass up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful addition to my shaving</li>
      <li>but it is hefty, well balanced and beautiful.</li>
      <li>I shave with a DE razor and this is a beautiful companion piece.  </li>
      <li>GREAT stand.</li>
      <li>Looks great in my bathroom, is functional, and I doubt I&#x27;ll ever need to replace it.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s a handy travel brush!</li>
      <li>All in all I am very pleased with the stand and its construction, it feels like quality piece and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>Would go nicely with any compatible DE razor and brush.</li>
      <li>There was also another reviewer who referred to this stand and Edwin Jagger handles pairing nicely.</li>
      <li>But I wanted to display it since it was so nicely chromed, so I bought this stand as well.</li>
      <li>synthetic brush which fit very nicely onto the stand...</li>
      <li>along wth Loxeetahn :)</li>
      <li>Researched DE razors for a bit and decided to go with the Muhle R89 Grande, and I love it.</li>
      <li>Love the chrome finish as it matches my R41 and silvertip brush.</li>
      <li>It more than fulfilled my expectations and would order again.    </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Love the look of this stand with my R89 Grande razor and the silver tip brush.</li>
      <li>a positive side note, the Frank&#x27;s Shaving Synthetic Travel Brush (http://amzn.com/B00BU98E6M) fits perfectly into the holder, matches the chrome beautifully, and costs a fraction of some of the other chromed handle brushes.</li>
      <li>Beautiful and proper way to store your DE razor and brush.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t bring myself to return the stand because it&#x27;s simply too beautiful</li>
      <li>I liked this stand so much I bought another for myself.  </li>
      <li>Price is high but design and quality is worth every $ you pay, pairs nicely with my R89</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful stand and deserves 5 stars, but the Q&amp;A section incorrectly stated that this would fit an Edwin Jagger DE89 handle; be warned that it does NOT fit the Edwin Jagger DE89 (with lined detail handle: http://amzn.com/B002RBF1PO).</li>
      <li>High quality finish, no discoloration, easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Great (heavy) quality and cool design.</li>
      <li>A beautiful compliment to the brush and razor, has an old world style and look as well as being solid.</li>
      <li>Nice heavy stand, but my Merkur Adjustable Razor won&#x27;t fit, Dang!</li>
      <li>It is a small but hefty stand of beautiful chrome which sets off the Muehle chrome razor and chrome handled badger hair brush.  </li>
      <li>Nice stand with some heft to it, the craftsmanship seems very good, solid, and the bottom has some soft material so it does not scratch or move from where you set it down on your sink counter.</li>
      <li>Very nice, heavy, compact, well-designed stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>weight IS right.</li>
      <li>I did not expect that as much as it cost!</li>
      <li>well, hopefully never ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;BTW, I&#x27;ve used The Art of Shaving and Edwin Jagger equipment and unguents for a few years now, but Muehle products are noticably superior in my opinion.</li>
      <li>; I suppose I will have to upgrade my daily shaver to a handle that will fit this stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the chrome polish is very attractive.&lt;br /&gt;Pair</li>
      <li>cool piece of art..which would last forever..</li>
      <li>Cost much less than purchasing from The Art of Shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely fit my needs.</li>
      <li>This may be true for other EJ handles, but not the DE89.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> cool piece of art..which would last forever..</li>
<li> Cost much less than purchasing from The Art of Shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely fit my needs.</li>
<li> This may be true for other EJ handles, but not the DE89.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I added the long version of the matching R89 double edge razor and matching brush.</li>
<li> This is a small nifty stand of high quality.</li>
<li> I especially like the way the Grande looks being held head side down in this holder because the handle to the R89 exudes elegance.</li>
<li> Minus one star for the price.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t speak for DE89&#x27;s with handle styles other than the lined handle, but my guess is they will also not work if they&#x27;re similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It seems the stand will work for other brushes than those made by Muehle.  </li>
<li> The handle was not completely straight up and down</li>
<li> I do not believe it will hold other razors as it holds the razor upside down and takes advantage of how the razor handle was designed specifically the razor handle&#x27;s neck to do this.</li>
<li> Some other brands may not fit.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;d previously ordered one of those $15 chrome stands, and there is a world of difference between the two.  </li>
<li> you can see from the pictures, the difference is less than a millimeter, but it&#x27;s *</li>
<li> so I looked a little closer</li>
<li> The ring for the brush holder does not fit every brush design.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive for what it is, though cheaper here than through M&amp;uuml;hle direct.</li>
<li> I did notice a very slight bend that I noticed when I placed my razor in it.</li>
<li> I am using a Dovo Silvertip Badger Brush with Micarta handle with the sand without any problem, and will hold other brushes with the standard wide base.</li>
<li> A bit expensive, yes ...</li>
<li> Expensive</li>
<li> And with the way its designed (holding the razor that close to it&#x27;s base) creates stability in the stand as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Got this from NY art of shaving store..cool piece of art..which would last forever..if maintained properly..&lt;br /&gt;the only gripe is with the price..otherwise grab this product..i have a Muhle R89 grande...along wth Loxeetahn :) synthetic brush which fit very nicely onto the stand...</li>
    <li> Very nice, heavy, compact, well-designed stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d previously ordered one of those $15 chrome stands, and there is a world of difference between the two.  If you just want a utilitarian razor stand, get one of those.  This one is 4X the price and looks it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re getting an Edwin Jagger or Muhle razor, the combination will probably be too beautiful to pass up.</li>
    <li> Researched DE razors for a bit and decided to go with the Muhle R89 Grande, and I love it. But I wanted to display it since it was so nicely chromed, so I bought this stand as well. A bit expensive, yes ... but it is hefty, well balanced and beautiful. I especially like the way the Grande looks being held head side down in this holder because the handle to the R89 exudes elegance. And with the way its designed (holding the razor that close to it&#x27;s base) creates stability in the stand as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did knock it one star ONLY because of the cost, but it doesn&#x27;t look like it will need to be replaced until ... well, hopefully never ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy ...</li>
    <li> Perhaps expensive for the simple purpose it fills, but it is aesthetically pleasing to have on the bathroom counter top.</li>
    <li> Simple design, function well for Muehle razors. Some other brands may not fit. The ring for the brush holder does not fit every brush design.  High quality finish, no discoloration, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Price is high but design and quality is worth every $ you pay, pairs nicely with my R89</li>
    <li> Beautiful and proper way to store your DE razor and brush. Love the chrome finish as it matches my R41 and silvertip brush. Would go nicely with any compatible DE razor and brush. Recommend it for any DE shaver!</li>
    <li> Love the look of this stand with my R89 Grande razor and the silver tip brush. I did notice a very slight bend that I noticed when I placed my razor in it. The handle was not completely straight up and down so I looked a little closer and it was off a bit. I did not expect that as much as it cost!</li>
    <li> GREAT stand. It&#x27;s an accessory, yeah... I know.&lt;br /&gt;The weight IS right. There&#x27;s no flimsy and cheap-looking sheet-metal holding up your razor or brush with this stand!&lt;br /&gt;And the chrome polish is very attractive.&lt;br /&gt;Pair it with the chrome Muhle R89 razor, and their the Silvertip Badger hair brush and you have a hansom set that is a pleasure to use and admire. :-D</li>
    <li> Nice stand with some heft to it, the craftsmanship seems very good, solid, and the bottom has some soft material so it does not scratch or move from where you set it down on your sink counter. I have one of the Muehle R89 Razors which this stand was designed to hold,  I do not believe it will hold other razors as it holds the razor upside down and takes advantage of how the razor handle was designed specifically the razor handle&#x27;s neck to do this. It seems the stand will work for other brushes than those made by Muehle.  I am using a Dovo Silvertip Badger Brush with Micarta handle with the sand without any problem, and will hold other brushes with the standard wide base. All in all I am very pleased with the stand and its construction, it feels like quality piece and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my husband! Fits his muhle razor and his generic brush.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and I love it.</li>
    <li> I am giving this brush stand to my son as a gift.  It is a small but hefty stand of beautiful chrome which sets off the Muehle chrome razor and chrome handled badger hair brush.  It more than fulfilled my expectations and would order again.    (23 Jan Update) I liked this stand so much I bought another for myself.  This is a small nifty stand of high quality.</li>
    <li> Expensive but you get what you pay for and with this stand you pay for style and functionality.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful stand and deserves 5 stars, but the Q&amp;A section incorrectly stated that this would fit an Edwin Jagger DE89 handle; be warned that it does NOT fit the Edwin Jagger DE89 (with lined detail handle: http://amzn.com/B002RBF1PO). There was also another reviewer who referred to this stand and Edwin Jagger handles pairing nicely. This may be true for other EJ handles, but not the DE89.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from the pictures, the difference is less than a millimeter, but it&#x27;s *just* enough to prevent the handle from sliding into the holder, even with the DE head removed. I can&#x27;t speak for DE89&#x27;s with handle styles other than the lined handle, but my guess is they will also not work if they&#x27;re similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t bring myself to return the stand because it&#x27;s simply too beautiful; I suppose I will have to upgrade my daily shaver to a handle that will fit this stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive side note, the Frank&#x27;s Shaving Synthetic Travel Brush (http://amzn.com/B00BU98E6M) fits perfectly into the holder, matches the chrome beautifully, and costs a fraction of some of the other chromed handle brushes. Plus it&#x27;s a handy travel brush!</li>
    <li> Nice heavy stand, but my Merkur Adjustable Razor won&#x27;t fit, Dang!</li>
    <li> Great (heavy) quality and cool design. Works with Merkur DE razor and Art of Shaving brushes. Minus one star for the price. It&#x27;s expensive for what it is, though cheaper here than through M&amp;uuml;hle direct.</li>
    <li> I shave with a DE razor and this is a beautiful companion piece.  Looks great in my bathroom, is functional, and I doubt I&#x27;ll ever need to replace it.</li>
    <li> Cost much less than purchasing from The Art of Shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely fit my needs.</li>
    <li> The design of this piece knocked me out immediately. I added the long version of the matching R89 double edge razor and matching brush. It&#x27;s a beautiful addition to my shaving array.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I&#x27;ve used The Art of Shaving and Edwin Jagger equipment and unguents for a few years now, but Muehle products are noticably superior in my opinion.</li>
    <li> A beautiful compliment to the brush and razor, has an old world style and look as well as being solid.</li>
