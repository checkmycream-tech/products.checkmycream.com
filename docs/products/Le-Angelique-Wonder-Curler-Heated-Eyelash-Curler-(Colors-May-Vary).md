### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It curls my lashes perfectly and hold the curl.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be great</li>
      <li>I bought this item thinking for 15.99 plus shipping that it would be a good product.</li>
      <li>This might work better for someone whose eyelashes are easier to curl.</li>
      <li>I love this curler.</li>
      <li>I bought this because of the great reviews but it really doesn&#x27;t curl at all.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>This product is just ok.  </li>
      <li>I like the TRIM better because this one doesn&#x27;t curl your eyelashes as well.</li>
      <li>I would say a blowdryer against a metal curler works 10x better.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>this product is a pleasure to use, works great and is so much more convenient than heating traditional curlers with hair dryer.</li>
      <li>and it gives a beautiful, lasting curl.</li>
      <li>It heats up fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the same great product.</li>
      <li>I have used heated eyelash curlers in this same price range and they worked great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, it heats quickly.  </li>
      <li>I only have good things to say about this product.</li>
      <li>Heating my metal curler with my dryer works much better and much faster than this thing.</li>
      <li>After two days of trying, this went right in the trash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll go back to running my metal curler under hot water - it works better.</li>
      <li>First time trying battery powered eyelash curler...</li>
      <li>Very disppointed!</li>
      <li>Of course it also works very well at curling your eyelashes!     </li>
      <li>I really regret purchasing this item.</li>
      <li>However, when I received this product, it felt cheap and the back fell off.</li>
      <li>I had a heated eyelash curler a while back, and I was really excited to be getting another one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In conclusion, the lash curler works, However not to my high standards of perfection.</li>
      <li>It lasted almost the entire two and half years, which I think is great considering it&#x27;s only $10!     </li>
      <li>Even with all the great reviews for this eyelash curler it failed to curl my lashes.</li>
      <li>I have long but very straight lashes that don&#x27;t hold a curl very well.</li>
      <li>and its not small or compact.</li>
      <li>It does not get hot enough to do anything.  </li>
      <li>Regular curlers didnt work well,and mascara always seemed to weigh them down more.</li>
      <li>Natural lashes are shiny and have that bounce</li>
      <li>but it does not look natural.</li>
      <li>I have a natural curl to my lashes</li>
      <li>I still rather use my old metal eyelash curler and carry it around in my purse.</li>
      <li>I actually stopped using it because the plain non-heated curler I have works a lot better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried various heated eyelash curlers and will be sticking with my shu uemura classic from now on.</li>
      <li>It heats up very quickly and is small and light enough for me to carry in my small makeup bag, which I take everywhere with me.</li>
      <li>Well, it actually did the opposite and made them straight.  </li>
      <li>I just purchased a new one since the other one finally stopped heating up.</li>

<li> Does not work as expected.</li>
<li> This product is not exactly what I thought it was going to be.  </li>
<li> This does not even curl the lashes hot or cold.  </li>
<li> What a waste.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Waste of Time &amp; Money</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
<li> This is a waste of money, it’s shaped in a way it’s almost impossible to use.  </li>
<li> Its a little painful too.  </li>
<li> If you are alright with some curl but not excellent curl this product is for you!</li>
<li> Very disappointed, I will be returning this product immediately.</li>
<li> too bad there isn&#x27;t an option to give a product NO STARS!!!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this same heated curler as a gift two and a half years ago and after having used it I will never go back to a regular eyelash curler. I just purchased a new one since the other one finally stopped heating up. It lasted almost the entire two and half years, which I think is great considering it&#x27;s only $10!     I only have good things to say about this product. It heats up very quickly and is small and light enough for me to carry in my small makeup bag, which I take everywhere with me. Of course it also works very well at curling your eyelashes!     The one I had before was the same color as the one pictured, but the one I received in the mail was black and pink. Not a problem though. It&#x27;s the same great product.</li>
    <li> I love this curler. It works.  It&#x27;s easy to use, it heats quickly.  I used to heat my eyelash curler with my blow dryer which was a pain.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First time trying battery powered eyelash curler...this product is a pleasure to use, works great and is so much more convenient than heating traditional curlers with hair dryer.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews of this product I thought I would give it a try.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  I have a natural curl to my lashes so I thought this would enhance it a bit.  Well, it actually did the opposite and made them straight.  In addition the product came in a different package made by another company Wonder Curler.  Amazon put a sticker over the bar code with the Le Angelique name and left the WonderCurler name and wesite exposed. I tried to locate the WonderCurler website and the company no longer exists, if it ever did.  Very disappointed, I will be returning this product immediately.</li>
    <li> My TRIM heated eyelash curler broke so I bought this one. I like the TRIM better because this one doesn&#x27;t curl your eyelashes as well.</li>
    <li> I was never the type of person to use eyelash curlers, but I had seen my friend use a heated one and I had never heard of such a thing! So i went online and ordered one (being this one). It curls my lashes perfectly and hold the curl.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have what you would call \\&quot;elephant eyelashes\\&quot;. My eyelashes curl downwards and cover a portion of my eye. Regular curlers didnt work well,and mascara always seemed to weigh them down more. This product works okay but it does not look natural. Natural lashes are shiny and have that bounce curl look. I have held the curler on my lashes for 30 seconds at a time and have only achieved a so-so curl with a few split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the lash curler works, However not to my high standards of perfection. If you are alright with some curl but not excellent curl this product is for you!</li>
    <li> I have used heated eyelash curlers in this same price range and they worked great.  This does not even curl the lashes hot or cold.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have long but very straight lashes that don&#x27;t hold a curl very well. I&#x27;ve tried various heated eyelash curlers and will be sticking with my shu uemura classic from now on. This product was worthless for me: no visibility, so it&#x27;s hard to see what you&#x27;re doing, and I can&#x27;t get it close to my lash line, so at best it just bends my lashes.

    <li> I bought this because of the great reviews but it really doesn&#x27;t curl at all.  Heating my metal curler with my dryer works much better and much faster than this thing.</li>
    <li> This product took me a week to get used to using it. And then after another week, it broke and I had to throw it away. What a waste.</li>
    <li> This product is not exactly what I thought it was going to be.  It heats up fine but it doesnt curl well at all. Its a little painful too.  All and all I would say a blowdryer against a metal curler works 10x better.</li>
    <li> I had a heated eyelash curler a while back, and I was really excited to be getting another one. However, when I received this product, it felt cheap and the back fell off. I could work with this, except the curler itself didn&#x27;t work either. I really regret purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> After buying three similar curlers in an effort to find one that is simple to use and works well, this is the one!  Easy to use and it gives a beautiful, lasting curl.</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking for 15.99 plus shipping that it would be a good product. After using it for 2 weeks it fell apart. Very disppointed!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.  It does not get hot enough to do anything.  It does not clamp tight enough to do anything.  I have used many different brands of heated eyelash curlers in the past and this one is the worse.</li>
    <li> too bad there isn&#x27;t an option to give a product NO STARS!!!!!!! this is nothing but junk. barly heated up. poorly made cheap plastic. and its not small or compact. I still rather use my old metal eyelash curler and carry it around in my purse.</li>
    <li> Even with all the great reviews for this eyelash curler it failed to curl my lashes. My lashes are stick straight and thick and every plastic curler I have tried hasn&#x27;t worked. I thought this would be great so I wouldn&#x27;t have to heat up my metal curler with a blow dryer, but this didn&#x27;t work for me at all. This might work better for someone whose eyelashes are easier to curl.</li>
    <li> This product is just ok.  I actually stopped using it because the plain non-heated curler I have works a lot better.  It could be user error....</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to curl my lashes.  I&#x27;ll go back to running my metal curler under hot water - it works better.</li>
    <li> Does not work as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money, it’s shaped in a way it’s almost impossible to use.  Then if you manage to get your lashes in there isn’t enough heat to curl.  Waste of Time &amp; Money</li>
