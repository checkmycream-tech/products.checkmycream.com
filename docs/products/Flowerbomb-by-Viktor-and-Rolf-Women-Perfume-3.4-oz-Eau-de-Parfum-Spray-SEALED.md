    <li> I love this perfume. I&#x27;ve been wearing fir years, and it&#x27;s still my favorite. The product is real, so do not hesitate in buying it; you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Dont buy from this seller.  The product .number on the box did not match up with the product number on the bottle.  I made contact with the seller.  They made an apology and offered a $15 bonus check.  My disappointment was that they were not shocked.  It appeared like, they knew already, and the explanation was not adequate for me.  If you want an inferior product buy from this seller.  I love the perfume Flowerbomb, but it won&#x27;t last long like the genuine product should.  Learn from my experience and buy wiser than this seller.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume! It was a good price and it is the real parfume, not a fake.</li>
    <li> Authentic. Numbers matched on the bottle and box. Smells delicious.</li>
    <li> Good deal. It did have the item number match on the parfume bottle and the box for authentication.  Wife enjoys the scent.</li>
    <li> doesnt quite seem to be the same scent as i had smelled before at the store.  Bottle looks the same. Does not last long. expensive for not that impressed.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it, great value compared to department store</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t personally use this but my 30 year old daughters do and they swear by it. They tell miss the part they like most is that it is a pleasant fragrance that requires only a small amount of content and lasts all day. Great for those times when you go from work to play without a break...... I can&#x27;t tell you much more than they are both hot and never lack for steady friends.</li>
    <li> One of my all time faves and I am a perfume addict!</li>
    <li> 2nd time buyer of this perf. Still in love with it! Smells so so beautiful, sexy, romantic, name it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it, just like the first bottle.  A little surprise it survived shipping as the inside box was all smashed, but otherwise the same beautiful scent that always gets compliments.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume.  Although it is a little pricey, Flowerbomb has become my instant  favorite.  I used it during the holidays and received many compliments.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Second time purchaser of  this item. My daughter was the first to receive it as a christmas gift, loved it ,received compliment after compliment from friends and coworkers. She mentioned it was the perfect gift for any occasion which led to my second purchase of this item for the greatest sister-in-law in the world. Believe me compliments outweigh any cost...</li>
    <li> Love this perfume smell so good</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance lasts all day and all night.  A little goes a very long way. Well worth the price. This is how real perfume is supposed to last.</li>
