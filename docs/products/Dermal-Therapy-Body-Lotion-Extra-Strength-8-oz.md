      <li>Best lotion I can find!  </li>
      <li>And this is the Best.</li>
      <li>just out-and-out-LIE, but Urea IS actually excellent for the skin.  </li>
      <li>Dermal Therapy works perfectly for my skin problems.</li>
      <li>I have tried lots and lots of lotions and I have decided that this is the best hand lotion for me</li>
      <li>Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for in the summer after gardening or for every day use.  </li>
      <li>Great Product.</li>
      <li>This is great stuff....</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
      <li>But this lotion keeps my arms, legs, elbows, knees, feet and ankles, and neck and shoulders supple and pleasant.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product because it has a fair amount of Urea in it (10%) and 5% Alpha Hydroxy acids as well as Silk Amino acids AND no Parabens.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the product, but it shipped quickly and received without any problems.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more!  </li>
      <li>This lotion and nail cream is really effective.</li>
      <li>The price has gone UP an astounding $10 in just a couple of months.</li>
      <li>I prefer lotions that immediately absorb but then again that might be one of the things that makes this one a more effective lotion than most.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>Many \\&quot;cosmetics\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It is soooo much better, now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll soon be ordering more.  </li>
      <li>I paid $13 with free shipping just a couple months ago and now it&#x27;s $23?!?</li>
      <li>In fact, lasts most of the day</li>
      <li>They have a cream made especially for feet that contains 25% Urea and that stuff is amazing !!</li>
      <li>It disappears very quickly.  </li>
      <li>My face had fine wrinkles &amp; kinda looked like crepe paper.</li>
      <li>Dermal Therapy lotion is a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the rich moisture without oiliness.</li>
      <li>I would pay ten times the price - it is that good.</li>
      <li>This is the best cream I have that works for my dry skin and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It smells nice - barely any smell at all - is not greasy and absorbs into the skin in seconds.</li>
      <li>In addition, Dermal Therapy is reasonably priced!!  </li>
      <li>Worth the money</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find it on Amazon as I thought it was only available in Canada.</li>
      <li>My hands began to heal right away ---  and with no itching or rashes.  </li>
      <li>My hands felt noticeably softer right away and not at all sticky.  </li>
      <li>and it is wonderful on her dry, rough, itcy and irritated skin.</li>
      <li>I use this product out of the shower/bath, and everything is very soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I have had extremely dry, thick skin and most products do not do a a very good job of healing or softening my skin.</li>
      <li>Priced way too much for this!</li>
      <li>This is the real stuff!  </li>
      <li>It absorbs and remains effective for longer than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely dry, flaky skin and most creams and lotions</li>
      <li>/&gt;Dermal Therapy has other products with much higher concentrations of Urea that are much better for issues like cracked feet.</li>
      <li>one thing I don&#x27;t particularly like about it is that when it is first applied it feels very greasy and you get the impression that it&#x27;s going to just sit there on the surface</li>
      <li>This lotion does not feel greasy, it keeps my hands moisturized for much longer periods of time than the others, it does not have any smells, and I like the way my hands feels after application.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t quite absorb as fast as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
      <li>This one is inexpensive &amp; really helps my face.</li>
      <li>Too much.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other Lotions</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad though not my personal preference</li>
      <li>I first tried Dermal Therapy Lotion at a yarn store (avid knitters often suffer dry hands from handling all that yarn) and was immediately surprised and impressed that a lotion could have such immediate effect.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The Urea/Alpha Hydroxy combo is the only ingredients that I&#x27;ve used that really seem to penetrate and make a real and noticeable</li>
      <li>I have ichtyosis vulgaris and it is primarily on my face, chest, and upper back.</li>
      <li>I hahave super dry skin</li>
      <li>I have struggled with this problem since I was very young and am now 62.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found really don&#x27;t do much more than just temporarily moisturize the surface layer of my skin, thus never really getting rid of the dry, flaky condition.</li>
      <li>(most other lotions leave me with dry hands after 45 minutes or so)  </li>
      <li>I ordered from Amazon.com as the product was unavailable locally and the price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>Not greasey or thick like most lotions.</li>
      <li>perhaps that is why it is not more widely available.  </li>
      <li>One of the side effects of my new medication was dry, sensitive hands and feet, and my doctor recommended I use a moisturizing lotion two or three times a day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> UPDATE: The price has gone UP an astounding $10 in just a couple of months. WHY?!? I paid $13 with free shipping just a couple months ago and now it&#x27;s $23?!? Too much. Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I have ichtyosis vulgaris and it is primarily on my face, chest, and upper back. I have tried countless heavy moisturizing lotions and all have broken my face out. This lotion I can use daily and it doesn&#x27;t cause break outs and thoroughly hydrates my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have that works for my dry skin and does not irritate my sensitive skin. The lotion absorbs well and does not have an odor.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I have tried lots and lots of lotions and I have decided that this is the best hand lotion for me (most other lotions leave me with dry hands after 45 minutes or so)  This lotion does not feel greasy, it keeps my hands moisturized for much longer periods of time than the others, it does not have any smells, and I like the way my hands feels after application. I wash my hands or get them wet doing dishes, house chores, etc., about once an hour or two.</li>
    <li> Dermal Therapy lotion is a fantastic product.  I have had extremely dry, thick skin and most products do not do a a very good job of healing or softening my skin. I often get rashes from the ingredients in the lotions and my hands crack and bleed often.  I have struggled with this problem since I was very young and am now 62.  This product is amazing!  My hands began to heal right away ---  and with no itching or rashes.  It has even helped the extremely dry skin on my face.  The redness and thick skin on my face has begun to soften too.  Dermal Therapy works perfectly for my skin problems.</li>
    <li> One of the side effects of my new medication was dry, sensitive hands and feet, and my doctor recommended I use a moisturizing lotion two or three times a day. I tried several different products from the local drug store, but all proved to be either greasy, smelly, expensive, or just plain didn&#x27;t work. Finally, I called the drug manufacturer of my medication, and one of their recommendations was Dermal Therapy lotion. I ordered from Amazon.com as the product was unavailable locally and the price was reasonable. To make a long story short, the Dermal Therapy lotion made all the difference. The dry skin on my hands and feet has been relieved and is no longer a concern. Yes, I recommend Dermal Therapy lotion, and have reordered a supply from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I suffer from ichsthyosis and I was hoping this would be the end-all for my condition.  Nope.  This product is no better than an over the counter lotion (like curel, etc).  It costs a lot (with shipping) and it smells bad.</li>
    <li> I first tried Dermal Therapy Lotion at a yarn store (avid knitters often suffer dry hands from handling all that yarn) and was immediately surprised and impressed that a lotion could have such immediate effect.  My hands felt noticeably softer right away and not at all sticky.  I searched and found the product on Amazon and am now using it as my daily body moisturizer. I&#x27;ll soon be ordering more.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have psorasis and my skin is extremely dry. Most of the moisturizers I have tried are greasy or smell bad or irritate my skin. This one does NOT. It smells nice - barely any smell at all - is not greasy and absorbs into the skin in seconds. Doesnt wash off as soon as I was my hands either. In fact, lasts most of the day Though I usually reapply to my hands after a few hours. I would pay ten times the price - it is that good.</li>
    <li> A key to youthful skin is Urea -- very hard to find in products nowadays.  This is the real stuff!  Many \\&quot;cosmetics\\&quot; just out-and-out-LIE, but Urea IS actually excellent for the skin.  It does accumulate in the body - perhaps that is why it is not more widely available.  With all the other \\&quot;unknown\\&quot; @#%* that we consume through the air, skin, mouth, and \\&quot;other\\&quot; mucous membranes -- perhaps Urea should be placed way down on the list of \\&quot;concerns.\\&quot;     In addition, Dermal Therapy is reasonably priced!!  You just can&#x27;t beat it -- long term.  I&#x27;m ordering more!  I use this, exclusively, in winter, however, see that my skin is not so youthful this summer.  Urea-based products should be used year round!  Someone please respond if I am mistaken....</li>
    <li> This lotion and nail cream is really effective. I enjoy the rich moisture without oiliness. The effects are healing and long lasting.</li>
    <li> This lotion has helped my dry face when other expensive facial products have not . I have tried quite a few and wasted a lot of money . This one is inexpensive &amp; really helps my face. My face had fine wrinkles &amp; kinda looked like crepe paper. IT was so dry. It is soooo much better, now. Not perfect but much much better than before.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. Not greasey or thick like most lotions. It has done wonders for my skin condition (ichthyosis)</li>
    <li> I have used Dermal Therapy for years.  I hahave super dry skin and it is the only thing that works for me.  Don&#x27;t ever stop making it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My granddaughter has dry skin and it is wonderful on her dry, rough, itcy and irritated skin.</li>
    <li> Was looking to replace Eucerin Skin Calming but that didn&#x27;t work out.  This doesn&#x27;t quite absorb as fast as I&#x27;d like.  It&#x27;s not bad though not my personal preference</li>
    <li> This is great stuff....I have icthyosis, and have used every lotion and bath oil that i can think of.  I use this product out of the shower/bath, and everything is very soft and smooth.  Best lotion I can find!  Worth the money</li>
    <li> Dermal Therapy Extra Strength Body lotion moisturizes my various body parts without feeling slippery or greasy.  It absorbs and remains effective for longer than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  Without it, much of my skin is dry and flaky; I can see dry skin on my dark clothing when I take it off at night.  But this lotion keeps my arms, legs, elbows, knees, feet and ankles, and neck and shoulders supple and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it has a fair amount of Urea in it (10%) and 5% Alpha Hydroxy acids as well as Silk Amino acids AND no Parabens. I have extremely dry, flaky skin and most creams and lotions I&#x27;ve found really don&#x27;t do much more than just temporarily moisturize the surface layer of my skin, thus never really getting rid of the dry, flaky condition. The Urea/Alpha Hydroxy combo is the only ingredients that I&#x27;ve used that really seem to penetrate and make a real and noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t particularly like about it is that when it is first applied it feels very greasy and you get the impression that it&#x27;s going to just sit there on the surface but then a mere 5 minutes later it&#x27;s all absorbed in. I prefer lotions that immediately absorb but then again that might be one of the things that makes this one a more effective lotion than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermal Therapy has other products with much higher concentrations of Urea that are much better for issues like cracked feet. They have a cream made especially for feet that contains 25% Urea and that stuff is amazing !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see the entire array of Dermal Therapy products AND the ingredients in each product they have a website: dermaltherapy.com (it annoys me when products here on Amazon don&#x27;t have the ingredients listed).</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the product, but it shipped quickly and received without any problems.  Priced way too much for this!</li>
    <li> Great Product. I use it on My Dry Hands. I have tried many other Lotions And this is the Best.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and years and find it is the only one that will keep my hands from cracking in the winter.  My husband even uses it in the cold weather.  I use it year round.  It&#x27;s great for in the summer after gardening or for every day use.  It is virtually unscented and is never greasy.  It disappears very quickly.  I was pleased to find it on Amazon as I thought it was only available in Canada.</li>
