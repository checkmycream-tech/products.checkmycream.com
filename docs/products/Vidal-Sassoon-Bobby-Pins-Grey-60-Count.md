      <li>Bobby pins; this is the kind of hairpin I have always used, when I use any.  </li>
      <li>Silver pins just blend better.  </li>
      <li>They are a pewtery silver which is ok for some parts of my hair.</li>
      <li>Mom felt that these were cheaply made since they are straight on the bottom, and not curved to lay comfortably against your scalp.  </li>
      <li>These are very hard to find at the local stores, so it was nice be able to get these as an add on for such a great price.</li>
      <li>Thanks a million!</li>
      <li>they are a  neutral color of silvery gray that would be fine in gray, white, and in-bewteen colors.</li>
      <li>They are fine from a functional standpoint, but they are very dark gray, not the light gray as pictured.</li>
      <li>I really like the color.</li>
      <li>they hold very well.</li>
      <li>I am on a quest for light gray or silver bobby pins, and these are definitely not what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>Very flimsy.</li>
      <li>And they work very well.</li>
      <li>They pretty nearly match mom&#x27;s hair color.  </li>
      <li>Even though I have grey hair, I still like to do fun hairstyles that need bobby pins.  </li>
      <li>I wanted some bobby pins that worked / blended a little better with blond hair than the traditional brown ones.</li>
      <li>I took a chance that these might really be like those I found locally that truly are silver.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m old and gray now, these gray ones will serve well.</li>
      <li>They were never easy to find locally, but have gotten even more challenging of late.</li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t find grey ones in the stores where i live at</li>
      <li>Bought them for my 75 year old grey haired mom.  </li>

<li> These bobby pins are a very ugly medium gray color that doesn&#x27;t blend very well at all.  </li>
