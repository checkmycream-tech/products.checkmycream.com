      <li>It does not have a strong smell of tea tree oil.  </li>
      <li>I have not found anything that makes it so silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>super easy</li>

      <li>And my hair is silky smooth, soft and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>Worth the $</li>

      <li>Works great for thick adult and kids hair.</li>
      <li>I have dry straight hair and this product leaves my hair super soft, tangle free and wasn&#x27;t greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Opro has a wonderful smell that doesn&#x27;t bother me throughout the day, unfortunately the same can&#x27;t be said for Mizani.</li>

    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and what a pleasure it is to not hear her complain as I brush her hair! I also use it and it has helped me immensely  with my dry scalp. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have to always have a combination of mousse and hair spray in my hair. I slept over my in-laws house and after showering the next morning I realized I forgot my hair products at home!! This is all my husband&#x27;s sister had for me to use and Wow! I sprayed it on my towel dried hair. Not only did it make brushing my hair super easy I let it air dry. I couldn&#x27;t believe how I amazing my natural curly hair looked with no other product in it but this. I&#x27;ve used my combo of mousse and hair spray for over 12 yrs. I just couldn&#x27;t believe it. I got so many compliments that day. On days I flat iron my hair it makes the process so much easier and faster for some reason. And my hair is silky smooth, soft and healthy looking. Before it looked really processed and dry. I&#x27;m so glad I came across this product. Can&#x27;t be with out it anymore:)</li>
    <li> My bottle says that it&#x27;s made in Korea. I don&#x27;t know how I feel about that. It&#x27;s okay stuff.  Not amazing, not terrible.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best for detailing your hair. Worth the $</li>
    <li> I bought this at TJMaxx because it smelled natural, not \\&quot;chemically\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find the same thing twice there so I was happy to see it available online!&lt;br /&gt;My daughters both have long hair and I had them in mind for this product but I like it so much, I&#x27;ve kept it to myself in my own bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not something I use everyday because I work from home so keep it for days I need to be more presentable!  But when I do use it, my hair is tangle free&lt;br /&gt;(reason for the purchase), soft, soft, soft as ever and looks much shinier!&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised there were no reviews for this but if there were, they would all be 5 star like mine!&lt;br /&gt;I like it and will definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a beauty supply store in my town.  This is great if you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day.  I wash my hair once/week, flat iron it and wrap it at night.  I use this spray when I wrap it to keep my hair in place. (I don&#x27;t use a lot of oil so my hair doesn&#x27;t wrap easily.) What I love about this is that even though it&#x27;s a liquid, it doesn&#x27;t undo the effects of the flat ironing. When I unwrap my hair in the morning, it&#x27;s still smooth, soft, and tangle-free. The fragrance is light enough that I can use it every night without the sent being overpowering.  I had originally selected this product because of the sent, but was pleasantly surprised by how nice and my hair was after using it.</li>
    <li> This product is so nice on my hair.  I have not found anything that makes it so silky and smooth.  My daughter tried it at a friend&#x27;s house and I was really happy to find it online.  I know that you can sometimes find it at a TJ Maxx for a little bit cheaper, but frankly, I was just glad to find the product available.  Plus, it came straight to my door!</li>

    <li> Works great and kids loved it !</li>
    <li> Amazingly this product is Organic....yet they added parabens.  What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I usually keep my hair braided with curly hair and it can tend to get very tangled. I bought both Opro Oraganic and Mizani detanglers and the Opro is by far the best and for half the price! The Opro has a wonderful smell that doesn&#x27;t bother me throughout the day, unfortunately the same can&#x27;t be said for Mizani. I now buy this two bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> I works okay. I don&#x27;t really notice it working, but my hair is slightly softer from it.</li>
    <li> I saw this in TJ Maxx and based on the Amazon reviews, decided to try it.  I spray this liberally onto damp hair then leave my hair to air dry.  I have dry straight hair and this product leaves my hair super soft, tangle free and wasn&#x27;t greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of heavily scented products and this had a lovely light scent.  It does not have a strong smell of tea tree oil.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other products from this range.</li>
    <li> Works great for thick adult and kids hair. I will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I bought at TJ MAxx. looks great,smells great! after washing my hair I sprayed on my hair. next day I couldn&#x27;t understand why my hair is so greasy! I just washed it the day before. This product didn&#x27;t work for me its just awful. But I found alternative Dove oil detangler that is simply AMAZING! makes my hair smooth, silky and NOT greasy!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes your hair sooo soft.</li>
    <li> Left my hair greasy and weighed down. Hair would not hold a curl after using this leave in</li>
    <li> I bought this product looking for a leave in conditioner, I love the way it smells but unfortunately It leaves my hair greasy and I don&#x27;t like the feeling of my hair being greasy the same day.</li>
    <li> I have had a terrible time finding a product that would enable me to comb through wet, fine tangled hair, this does the trick and my hair feels much healthier and manageable! I have had this problem all my life.</li>
