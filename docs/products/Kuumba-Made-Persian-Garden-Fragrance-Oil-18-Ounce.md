      <li>This would be nice in a gift basket, or a as a stocking stuffer.</li>
      <li>Even at its best it doesn&#x27;t compare to what I normally wear.</li>
      <li>Nice light scented oil that lasts all day!</li>
      <li>My best friend said shae could barely smell it all , so it is not just my perception.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very light and not overbearing</li>
      <li>The smell is so light and warm, almost like a baby smell.</li>
      <li>I have purchased many kuumba made fragrances over the years.</li>
      <li>I love this product, I have been using it for years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many woman &amp; men ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
      <li>Been using this scent for years and love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>and I love the smell on her.</li>
      <li>In just one sniff I fell in love with this oil blend.  </li>
      <li>Persian Garden is my favorite</li>
      <li>It is a shame, because this is a lovely fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>then I purchased some more... and more and more.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t wait to try more of their scents.  </li>
      <li>I do like it a lot and will be buying more.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it on here.  </li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>More like a garden in winter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and musky and not at all overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I love this sent because it is so light yet everyone seems to notice it.  </li>
      <li>Sure feel free to buy it if you like that smell....</li>
      <li>This is another lovely, light scent that wafts upward as my body heat rises from movement.</li>
      <li>I noticed that most of the  people that have written great reviews on this companies products seem to have never tried these types of oils and fragrances from other more reputable and quality companies, and are comparing them to the Jean Nate they have bought at the chain drugstore.</li>
      <li>I found this by chance, after reading some great things about the fragrance Gypsy Water, and a few comments about how this was a good, affordable, substitute.  </li>
      <li>I used the tester on my wrist and it stayed on strong even after a shower.</li>
      <li>of all, it&#x27;s not so strong that people can smell me walking into the room.  </li>
      <li>I had high expectations, considering all th good reviews.</li>
      <li>item came quick, I get many compliments on the smell.</li>
      <li>I smelled this at Whole Foods and fell in love!</li>
      <li>Perfect fragrance to wear all year round.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s paraben free, no chemicals.</li>
      <li>They do not give me headaches like department-store perfumes and I enjoy wearing them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve smelled one at whole foods that was much better.</li>
      <li>Even though this perfume is mild, it still gave me a headache.  </li>
      <li>I actually love, love this scent and just wish they sold larger versions...</li>
      <li>It is very a light, personal scent that will make it&#x27;s presence known throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;(I also find the smell more effective, and longer lasting when applied to places of the body where hair grows, like the arms)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now that you are aware these types of oils,products and fragrances exist, look farther and you will find many other companies selling MUCH better quality at more reasonable prices.</li>
      <li>really...not grass...not fresh air...</li>
      <li>Rarely do I purchase perfume that I haven&#x27;t smelled for myself first, but it sounded really nice, and since this version was so reasonably priced, I gave it a try (There are no high-end department stores in our small town where I might have been able to sample the original).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I may still purchase the same scent at whole foods, because it is nice...</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic and from what I understand, is natural.  </li>
      <li>Persian Garden was one of the first oils I had the privilege of smelling.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Kuumba sells larger quantities of their scents on their website, so I will be trying the 1/4 oz, or the 1/2 oz of this scent, in hopes that it will be more pungent.</li>
      <li>This was the first bottle I opened from the store display and was blown over.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Though I used the Arabian Rose I&#x27;ve stopped for now as I&#x27;m concerned about using &amp;#34;fragrance oil&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34; essential oil&amp;#34; due to chemicals- need to do more research.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>But I wear Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker more on social occasions because it is also fresh but a little stronger and sexier.</li>
      <li>Perhaps something that my being really needs as I am often in my higher chakras with my feet off the ground.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>have been wearing Persian Garden for many years, however, the newer batches of this perfume have a different ingredient or is not as pure or something because it has been irritating my skin a great deal.</li>
      <li>The scent is so soft &amp; clean, and very sensuous...</li>
      <li>I had not yet tried this scent, either-what a fun shipment with new scents to try.</li>
      <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like dirt or nothing.  </li>
      <li>just take a trip to your nearest Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>I picked it up at whole foods market for $10.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Having bought this before in whole foods....</li>
      <li>Very earthy and grounding.  </li>
      <li>Very saddened by the product.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I wear this oil because I am very sensitive to regular perfumes, they are too strong.  </li>
      <li>Another thing is it infuses into your skin and creates a bio-chemical reaction unique only to you.  </li>
      <li>it is a clean musk smell that I can&#x27;t get enough of.</li>
      <li>It has very slight pleasant scent which does not last.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a new fragrance, give Persian Garden a try!</li>
      <li>Less is more.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite scent, I put it on everyday.</li>
      <li>Maybe this one is older.</li>
      <li>Work away my precious little angel.</li>
      <li>(other reviewers have had the same experience) and change their formula back to the original or use better ingredients.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the smell of this, but it seems to disappear after a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is almost non-existent in the bottle, and it doesn&#x27;t reach very far when it&#x27;s on the skin, either.</li>
      <li>It is very subtle, not too sweet or spicy, so fine for every day.</li>
      <li>and I have to completely disagree.</li>
      <li>I discovered these while visiting our local organic and whole foods store named Ever&#x27;man&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to chemically-formulated perfumes, (they give me a headache), so turned to essential oils.</li>
      <li>However, this specific product does not last nearly as long as the ones from whole foods.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong and subtle at the same time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this sent because it is so light yet everyone seems to notice it.  Most of the time I can&#x27;t smell it on myself, but people will ask &#x27;what are you wearing, it smells awesome.&#x27;  it is a clean musk smell that I can&#x27;t get enough of.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this scent!!! I had a friend introduce it to me, and I&#x27;ve been searching for it ever since.  So glad I found it on here.  The scent is so soft &amp; clean, and very sensuous... Its hard to explain, but I can&#x27;t get enough of it! I&#x27;ve had several compliments on it when I wear it.  If you are indecisive on which scent to choose, this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> There was no scent at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I had high expectations, considering all th good reviews. I think I may have gotten a bad batch. I&#x27;ve smelled one at whole foods that was much better. I was told this is an ambre blends knock off and I have to completely disagree. Even at its best it doesn&#x27;t compare to what I normally wear. I may still purchase the same scent at whole foods, because it is nice...just not the one I received from this seller. It smells a little too synthetic and bland.</li>
    <li> I heard that this fragrance resembled an expensive perfume that made men go wild.  For the life of me, I cannot remember what perfume it is supposed to resemble.  Anyhow, received this little roll-on fragrance and I liked it.  I ordered a couple of them - one to carry in my purse and another to keep in my desk drawer at work. I will probably order some of the other fragrances they have.  The product arrived in a timely manner.  This would be nice in a gift basket, or a as a stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> The order came as expected. I actually love, love this scent and just wish they sold larger versions...well, the do, it&#x27;s just so darn expensive.</li>
    <li> I smelled this at Whole Foods and fell in love! I used the tester on my wrist and it stayed on strong even after a shower. However, this specific product does not last nearly as long as the ones from whole foods. I am not sure if it is diluted or not.</li>
    <li> I actually smelled this on a total stranger and had to ask them where I could find it. I picked it up at whole foods market for $10.&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is so light and warm, almost like a baby smell. I hate heavy or over powering scents.&lt;br /&gt;- The rollerball allows you to apply as much or as little as you want to your pulse points.&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way. The scent lasts; I accidentally got some on my jacket sleeve and I could still smell it a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;- I like that it&#x27;s a personal scent that someone can&#x27;t smell from across the room, but if they&#x27;re sitting close they can notice in a subtle way.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  Very similar to Ambre.  Small bottle, but lasts a long time.  I like the roll on feature.</li>
    <li> In just one sniff I fell in love with this oil blend.  I traditionally don&#x27;t like to wear scents as I cant commit to the obtrusive smell all day.  But this one I had to have for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this vial in July 2013,and it is delish!  It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like dirt or nothing.  It smells like a musky summer rain.  Very earthy and grounding.  Perhaps something that my being really needs as I am often in my higher chakras with my feet off the ground.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their scents.  This was the first bottle I opened from the store display and was blown over.  I sniff-tested only about three others and decided I was already sold on Persian Garden.&lt;br /&gt;This also lasts all day, I could still smell it the next morning. Another thing is it infuses into your skin and creates a bio-chemical reaction unique only to you.  So, if this scent doesn&#x27;t react well with you, just try another and it may be a perfect chemical match.  However if you like the scent from the bottle, you could use it on Oil Essence Jewelry so the reaction doesn&#x27;t affect the bottled scent.</li>
    <li> Over priced, under quality. If you like this companies products, you&#x27;ve obviously never tried similar products from other companies. I noticed that most of the  people that have written great reviews on this companies products seem to have never tried these types of oils and fragrances from other more reputable and quality companies, and are comparing them to the Jean Nate they have bought at the chain drugstore. This company sells products like this one, that are made to extract premium prices from the unknowing. Now that you are aware these types of oils,products and fragrances exist, look farther and you will find many other companies selling MUCH better quality at more reasonable prices. Don&#x27;t stop and accept Kuumba Made junk because they out did the makeup counter in target. Look on and try others. You and you wallet will be happier!</li>
    <li> Love this.  I roll on quite a bit on my wrist.  It&#x27;s heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it&#x27;s not so strong that people can smell me walking into the room.  Don&#x27;t be that person.  Less is more.</li>
    <li> best perfume around!!! seriously--- I get compliments all day long. Great product!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite scent, I put it on everyday. I have been wearing this for 2 years and still continue to receive compliments on a regular basis. Smells fantastic and from what I understand, is natural.  I do not wear perfume or put chemical fragrance on my skin.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! I have already reordered 2 bottles</li>
    <li> Smells a lot like Essential Faith oil, just $40-$50 cheaper. I luv the roll-on oils, it&#x27;s paraben free, no chemicals.</li>
    <li> Having bought this before in whole foods.... I was disappointed when I received it. It&#x27;s hard to explain the smell. Totally different than the store one. Smells old and stale. Don&#x27;t waste your money.... just take a trip to your nearest Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> I discovered these while visiting our local organic and whole foods store named Ever&#x27;man&#x27;s. While wondering around the store I found myself on the oil aisle. I discovered Kuumba Made oils and began the smell-a-thon. Persian Garden was one of the first oils I had the privilege of smelling. The smell is amazing. I can only imagine how they&#x27;ve created this heavenly scent. Perhaps they&#x27;ve captured some beautiful angel and this is the oil seeping out of his sebaceous glands coming from his luxurious hair. Whatever it is I&#x27;m delighted to have found it. Work away my precious little angel.</li>
    <li> Smells like dirt...really...not grass...not fresh air...dirt...hard, dry, old....dirt. Sure feel free to buy it if you like that smell....(what smell?)...dirt.</li>
    <li> item came quick, I get many compliments on the smell. it&#x27;s very light and not overbearing</li>
    <li> I have purchased many kuumba made fragrances over the years. Persian Garden is my favorite and I often am asked what scent I am wearing. I am sensitive to chemically-formulated perfumes, (they give me a headache), so turned to essential oils. They do not give me headaches like department-store perfumes and I enjoy wearing them immensely.&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing Persian Garden for many years, however, the newer batches of this perfume have a different ingredient or is not as pure or something because it has been irritating my skin a great deal. I am getting a rash wherever I put the oil on my skin and it has even caused the skin to break open. Sadly, I will have to discontinue Kuumba made fragrances because of this reason. I do hope they take these reviews seriously (other reviewers have had the same experience) and change their formula back to the original or use better ingredients. It is a shame, because this is a lovely fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review to 5 stars if I hear their ingredients become non-irritating (as they used to be).&lt;br /&gt;For now, Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Even though this perfume is mild, it still gave me a headache.  I read a review that said it was the only perfume they could wear, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The Arabian Rose is amazing! But this Persian Garden? No. More like a garden in winter.&lt;br /&gt;Though I used the Arabian Rose I&#x27;ve stopped for now as I&#x27;m concerned about using &amp;#34;fragrance oil&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34; essential oil&amp;#34; due to chemicals- need to do more research.&lt;br /&gt;As for this one I thought I received dud bottle- just plain oil with no fragrance or color in it. Didn&#x27;t have time then to deal with exchange. It has very slight pleasant scent which does not last.</li>
    <li> I found this by chance, after reading some great things about the fragrance Gypsy Water, and a few comments about how this was a good, affordable, substitute.  Rarely do I purchase perfume that I haven&#x27;t smelled for myself first, but it sounded really nice, and since this version was so reasonably priced, I gave it a try (There are no high-end department stores in our small town where I might have been able to sample the original).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Persian Garden is hard to describe.  It&#x27;s subtle, but definitely not wimpy or &amp;#34;watery.&amp;#34;  I find it seductive and alluring in an unobtrusive, background sort of way.  Not overpowering, but very much present.  Complex, yet somehow simple at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new fragrance, give Persian Garden a try!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this, but it seems to disappear after a few minutes.  Wish it would have some staying power.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent. Didn&#x27;t realize how tiny a container it is in. I do like it a lot and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Must have gotten a bad batch, there is no smell at all? Literally nothing...</li>
    <li> \\&quot;There was no scent to the oil. I left it opened for days as I was told to do and still no scent. I feel I paid for oil and that was it. Very saddened by the product.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The first time I smelled this was on my sister and It was so awesome I forced her to give me hers... then I purchased some more... and more and more. I got some for gifts for people and I still continually wear it on a daily to weekly basis!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, light airy fragrance. Every time I wear it people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing! Bought one for the ladies in the office because they couldn&#x27;t stop smelling me!</li>
    <li> Found it after a co-worker was wearing it and inquired about it. I have gotten compliments from other people as well! Great smell, and I&#x27;m picky!</li>
    <li> I had not yet tried this scent, either-what a fun shipment with new scents to try. This is another lovely, light scent that wafts upward as my body heat rises from movement. It is not overpowering so is not offensive. Please keep making these scents.</li>
    <li> Product smells ok, but maybe not so great on me. A friend always wears it and I love the smell on her. It is not very strong though.</li>
    <li> Been using this scent for years and love it.  I did find that the Wholefoods one lasted longer throughout the day.  Maybe this one is older.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! I wear this oil because I am very sensitive to regular perfumes, they are too strong.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like it would get attention or noticed, but I always get compliments when I wear it....just enough scent without being overbearing. Several friends and colleagues have purchased it after I tell them what I wear. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a scent that smells very similar to Byredo Gypsy Water (over $200 for 100ml), and I believe I have found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is almost non-existent in the bottle, and it doesn&#x27;t reach very far when it&#x27;s on the skin, either. It is very a light, personal scent that will make it&#x27;s presence known throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;(I also find the smell more effective, and longer lasting when applied to places of the body where hair grows, like the arms)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kuumba sells larger quantities of their scents on their website, so I will be trying the 1/4 oz, or the 1/2 oz of this scent, in hopes that it will be more pungent.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me her bottle of Persian Garden because I admired the scent on her. It is very subtle, not too sweet or spicy, so fine for every day. But I wear Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker more on social occasions because it is also fresh but a little stronger and sexier. Both get me compliments.</li>
    <li> This is an intoxicating floral scent.  I&#x27;ve had many woman &amp; men ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years &amp; will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have been using it for years and I always get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrance and it smells amazing!  It&#x27;s light and musky and not at all overwhelming.  Perfect fragrance to wear all year round.</li>
    <li> I do not know if the the formula was changed, but the oil gave me a rash on my neck. I had to stop using it even though I loved the scent.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. It&#x27;s strong and subtle at the same time. Very elegant.</li>
    <li> I find this oil rather weak and diluted smaelling . My best friend said shae could barely smell it all , so it is not just my perception. Will not repurchase this .</li>
    <li> Nice light scented oil that lasts all day! Love it!</li>
