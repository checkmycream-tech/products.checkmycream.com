<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product was excellent, however I found that it didn&#x27;t moisturize my face quite enough. I use topical acne medication and it wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as expected.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It sinks right into the skin, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy finish. I am extremely pleased with the product. The fact that it is also SPF 30 makes it even better.  I no longer have to add sunscreen on top of my moisturizer. Wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the packaging. I think they should rethink how it&#x27;s packaged and be more environmentally friendly. I still love it!  And it works so well when combined with their Vitamin C Serum. Definitely get that too. It&#x27;s like putting silk on your face and it just feels fantastic. Love, love them both.</li>
    <li> Update 5/6/15--I purchased this product for the second time because I love it... and the price and the quanity you get for your money can&#x27;t be beat!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super sensitive skin that often breaks out in a rash or bumps whenever I use moisturizers, so I&#x27;ve always been very picky about what I use.  I can truly say that after two weeks, this product has been very agreeable with my skin.  I love the texture and the way it feels going on.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with my skin reacting to it at all, and my makeup goes on very smoothly over it.  I also love the fact that I get extra SPF protection on top of what is offered by my mineral foundation.  My skin feels firmer after I apply it, but not tight. I was impressed by the amount you receive for the money, considering it contains only natural ingredience.  Very nice product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I love my new face moisturizer , it is creamy and light. My skin feels soft and wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have finally found the perfect moisturizer sunscreen for my very sensitive skin. It has a nice consistency a light citrus scent and is quickly absorbed into your skin. An added bonus is it also has antioxidant properties! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Came on time but its better if they leave package at front door than in mail box. Excellent Moisturizer  and no greasy with SPF 30.</li>
    <li> It smells like old school nair which is a little off putting for me.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely cream.  I have mild rosacea which has stayed the same or improved, and having 30 SPF which is non irritating to my sensitive skin is great.  I have already re-ordered.</li>
    <li> I like love this product. I have very sensitive skin with some acne and I have been using many different expensive moisturizer for along period of time for me sensitive skin. Some of them worker but they were so pricy, but this moistrizer and sun screen ( two things in one product) is the best among all of them. I like how it feels on my skin. Smooth not greasy and I like the smell of it it is like orange smell. I am going to stick to it and buy it again. It is worth the money. I really recommend it for others :)</li>
    <li> I like how it looks and feels after applying to skin.  Unlike other sunscreen products, this leaves a matted finish and the smell is light.  The only downside is the packaging.  The jar takes up too much space in my cabinet.  There is too much necessary plastic.</li>
    <li> A satisfied customer. Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I got a skin analysis and what I thought were &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; freckles were actually sun spots and sun damage.  I was so shocked to find this out because I never sit out in the sun and don&#x27;t expose myself to the sun more than I have to.  Same for my husband.  The nurse at the medi spa suggested a good cream with SPF.  So when I got home I simply typed in &amp;#34;best moisturizer with SPF&amp;#34; and a link took me to the VIDI cream on amazon.  After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try but I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything different from what I had tried before.  I have oily and dry skin at the same time and I am prone to breakouts at 42.  All other moisturizers and SPF creams had left me disappointed but after one day of using VIDI i realized that this cream is different.  It&#x27;s thick but absorbs quickly into my skin, moisturizes thoroughly without making me shiny or oily and as an added bonus makes my skin really soft.  I also noticed that my skin looks clearer and my pores don&#x27;t seem as large as before.  My husband is a helicopter pilot so he is always a lot closer to the sun than I am and those rays do a job on him.  He is using the cream as well and he must like it because this is the first time ever that he uses a product on a daily basis without my having to scream at him to use it! I am going to try the vitamin C serum next!</li>
    <li> This cream smells great and has all the elements of a moisturizer I am looking for.  Also a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer, and have just ordered my second jar.  It&#x27;s long lasting, is light and yet not watery feeling like many light moisturizers.  I also love that it has spf 30, yet doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  A great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> This product works great. I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin on my face. I cannot use plain old sunblock on my face as I will break out. I have tried numerous other products, both cheaper and much more expensive than Vidi. I put this on every morning and it does not irritate my skin at all. One thing this product does, but is not advertised for is it gets rid of the razor burn I get from shaving. It absorbs very fast, is not greasy at all. It smells great, but not over powering. My face does not get sunburn. My skin is really soft too! Will continue to buy this product forever.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer looks and feels sinfully decadent...by far the richest and creamiest product I&#x27;ve used. It looks heavy (like the sweetened whipped sour cream on some cheesecakes) and forms a peak when the lid is removed, but when you touch it, it is actually very light-weight. On my dry skin, it goes on smoothly and easily and although most of it absorbs rapidly, I can still feel a very thin layer on my face--it gives my skin a &#x27;finished&#x27; appearance which is great since I usually don&#x27;t wear make-up. This product leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and I am very happy that it contains a sun-block so I can use one less product and skip a step. I use several retinol products at night, so I try to be very careful about adding sun protection to my daily routine--the only downside to this is having to reapply every two hours or so...I would like to say I do this (but I don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I think this is an excellent moisturizer to use alone or in combination with other skin-care products. I also think it is rather expensive; I would definitely not repurchase this at the list price of $69.95, and even the current price of $29.75 for 1.7 ounces seems high to me, although I have to say it is worth it and I would probably be able to overcome my frugal tendencies and buy it again at that price (I don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so this should last a long time).</li>
    <li> light scent of cucumber I Love how it works on my skin</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service.  My face feels wonderful, not greasy.  Wonder if they make a night cream too?</li>
    <li> This is a really nice moisturizer that feels great on your skin. So nice to protect your face with SPF 30 while you moisturizer. It absorbs quickly so you can put makeup on and go. I really like this moisturizer.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> nice light fragrance, I really like it, and think it is a great value.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it after applying the VIDI  Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I do not care for the texture or consistency of the cream, it leans toward the thicker side of creams.&lt;br /&gt;It takes awhile to rub it in so I put little bits on at a time.  If this is what you prefer than go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the cream is fine.  I like that it has a 30spf (the reason for ordering). I like the color and the fragrance is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Trying a new product when you&#x27;re accustomed to the look and feel of another is always a risk.  I&#x27;m sure this product is fabulous.  I, however, simply wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture and the feel.  VIDI Beauty was so kind to offer a full refund after I provided feedback.  Not expecting a refund, I was rather surprised by this exceptional customer service.  When a seller requests feedback of their product and actually listens, that is rare.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer with spf 30. It&#x27;s creamy on my skin and keeps it soft to the touch. This is my second jar, so I like it enough to keep using it. I look for anti-aging products, but this one fits my needs. Plus, I live in Florida and the sun is strong down here. I need a good sun protection and moisturizer. Vidi is my go to cream every day.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen does not leave your skin dry or oily. I used to serum also and I&#x27;ve seen my skin get brighter.&lt;br /&gt;Their customer service is out of this world  Liz followed up with me to see how I was doing after I received it.&lt;br /&gt;This is another winner for me.</li>
    <li> I received it, but I haven&#x27;t use until now,  it looks good, I will try it a few days later.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews for this product, I decided that it would be a good fit for me and ordered it through Amazon Prime. It arrived within two days and the seller contacted me immeadiately to find out how I liked the product and offering to answer any questions I might have. I used the moisturizer for several days before realizing that I was having an allergic reaction to it. My skin was drying out and peeling in certain places - I have very sensitive skin! I contacted to seller to ask if they had any recommendations and to let them know I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to use the product. She responded within the hour telling me to stop using the product, apologizing for my bad reaction to it and issuing me a refund without my asking for it. Amazon issued the refund that night. Not every product is right for every person, but this seller was fantastic and I would definitely be willing to order a product from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to note that I had no trouble with the &amp;#34;white face&amp;#34; issue a few reviews mentioned and found the moisturizer to be of a good consistency with almost no scent. If you use smaller amounts of the cream and rub them into one area of your face at a time you shouldn&#x27;t have any trouble getting it rubbed in.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice cream, but too thick for me. I&#x27;m in love with their serum. Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> It is exactly like what I paid four times the amount for.  Like that it has sun protection also.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a creamier texture. I am used to clarens products and decided to try yours. I have  very dry skin and this does not offer enough moisturizer.My face feels dry within 1 hour. Maybe because of the sun block? I guess that you get what you pay for. This product would be fine for those with regular to oily skin.</li>
    <li> Works very well and smooths on evenly</li>
    <li> Does anyone remember the lemon meringue pie scene in the movie Mrs. Doubtfire?  The scene where Robin Williams meets the social worker assigned to his case outside the apartment dressed as Mrs. Doubtfire.  He (or rather she) goes upstairs with the social worker and has to pretend that she is an older sister.  Of course this is one of the funnier scenes because he has to keep changing from a &amp;#34;she&amp;#34; to a &amp;#34;he&amp;#34;.  Then in his hurry to change and because two boys across the street were peeping in his open window, he tries to choo them away and knocks the mask out the window where it gets run over by a truck.  What is he to do?  He offers the social worker some tea by Mrs. Doubtfire in order to give him time because now he has no mask so he smashes his face into the lemon meringue pie (at least it looks like a lemon meringue pie) and says &amp;#34;HELLO&amp;#34;.  The social worker ask why he is wearing a pie on his face and Mrs. Doubtfire says it is good for the skin.  Then my favorite part, the pie is melting and a big dollop lands on the social worker&#x27;s tea and Mrs. Doubtfire leaves.  The social worker then dips her finger in the dollop and delicately applies the pie creme on her face.  Hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does this movie and in particular this scene come into mind when I use this product?  Because I felt like the social worker when she was dabbing the creme on her face.  In a review of another Vidi product, the Vitamin C Serum, I described that product as wispy as a cloud.  I would describe this moisturizer as fluffy as a lemon meringue pie.  Oh yeah and it smells yummy too.  The best thing I like about this moisturizer besides the texture is that it provides adequate sunscreen protection without making me cry (ok so I am exaggerating a bit).  Every sunscreen product I use makes my eyes tear up so that I have to keep rubbing them continuously all day.  I have always been complimented on my skin and I never really did any maintenance on it.  I thought that I had great skin because I hardly drink alcohol, never smoked in my life and use sunscreen when i go to the beach.  However, as I get older, I still have great skin for 45 but I now know that I have to use sunscreen EVERY single day even in the winter because my skin is prone to sun freckles and dark spots.  This product although reasonably priced is a little steeper than I normally spend on my skin products but since it doesn&#x27;t make me tear up, why should I cry about the price.  My first jar came with a discount on future products, I am not sure if this is promotional but I will take any help I can get.  Thanks Vidi.I had great skin because I hardly drink alcohol, never smoked in my life and use sunscreen when i go to the beach.

    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is day #2 for me. So far so good! I used it immediately following a skin upset from a drug store &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brand and I&#x27;m glad I found something to calm and sooth my skin. This is my first time using an anti aging product as well. I just turned 31.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic changes in terms of lines but I thought much at this time. Unlike other SPF cream, I have used, my skin has not had any reaction in the month that I&#x27;ve been using it. The texture is great, looks bright and no residual stuff on your face. Provides moisture without making your face oily (I have combination skin)</li>
    <li> Packaged in a generous 1.7 ounce glass jar. Creme is the normal moderately thick white cream. I can&#x27;t detect any strong smell, just a very faint fresh clean smell that doesn&#x27;t linger long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great sunscreen for sensitive skin. A lot of sunscreen products irritate my skin or burn a little bit especially when sweating, this one hasn&#x27;t so far and I tried it for 4 days now and sweated with it on pretty heavy. It doesn&#x27;t leave a thick mask like feeling like some other sunscreens I have tried, make up goes on easily right over it. Leaves my skin soft, smooth, very hydrated and fresh looking. So far I have no clogged pores which a lot of sunscreens do to my skin. It absorbs quickly, leaves no oily residue or sticky feeling. One more thing that is my pet peeve of sunscreens, if I sweat while wearing them and the sweat gets in my eyes it burns like crazy, and this one doesn&#x27;t burn if I get sweat i my eyes either. Just this has sold me on this as sweating outside and burning my eyes, it is really hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t do that to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

    <li> This moisturizer feels so good going on and that moisturized feeling stays for the better part of the day.  It doesn&#x27;t start feel \\&quot;tight\\&quot; as the day goes like some of them do.  SPF protection seems to work well. I have not had occasion to spend an entire day out in sun yet.  I still see wrinkle lines but they may be somewhat less; definitely not worse.  I was a little concerned  as it does go on a little white at first which is a given with a SPF product, but it blends in very quickly. So far this product seems to be a winner over the MANY others I have tried.  Glad I found something good  so I don&#x27;t have to go back to plain moisturizer without SPF protection. . I won&#x27;t use anything with parabans and chemicals so this was a great find all the way around.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. The cream is light and smells wonderful. It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin hydrated. I have not had any issues at all using a new product. I would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> just started using it last week. waiting for result. Not seing anything yet but smells very good.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this cream several times both for myself and my mom.  We both love it.  Not greasy but moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I tried it for just 1 day and liked it.  I have some other moisturizer to finish using up and then I will start using your new one.  I have&lt;br /&gt;used SPF moisturizers in the past and I like them very much.  This product only gets better. It never leaves a residue and work just great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product before and I loved it. You truly only need a little bit for your face. Still love it.</li>
    <li> Received the product timely!  haven&#x27;t been using it consistently yet, but does not feel heavy.  Will order from vender again</li>
    <li> I have tried so many moisturizers and never found any that made my skin feel soft and not irritate it. Most made me break out or gave me red bumps. This one, along with the vitamin C serum is amazing. Best purchase I have made and the price is so reasonable. On top of that, I love the communication from Liz. Definitely am a forever customer</li>
    <li> The spf irritates my skin and this stuff is way too greasy for me to use!</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more like a &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; cream. I&#x27;m really liking this companies products.</li>
    <li> I am over the moon impressed with this product! The packaging is rather unassuming so I didn&#x27;t really expect much from it, but man it delivers so much! The product is wonderful! I am 28, pale as could be with very sensitive skin- so I have been through a ton of products and I am very picky! This product in no way hurt my sensitive skin which is wonderful. It is a very luxuriously thick cream, but it absorbs into your skin very fast. It  does leave your skin every so slightly tacky, but I like that. The packaging surprisingly nice. It is easy to open and easy to grip so this would be nice for someone who has some issue open tricky cosmetic products. This product works great with my normal makeup routine, which is a big accomplishment. A lot of silicone based foundations (which is most liquids) have a hard time blending with sun screen product and start to separate- this doesn&#x27;t cause any issues at all. I have tested it with a number of foundations (liquids, mouse and powered) and have had great results. It also works great with many primers on the market. I tried this product with a number of them and found it worked best with an oil free primer, but had great results with pretty much all of them. This product also hydrates you skin sooooo well. I live in dry Colorado and I need  super moisturizer and this product delivers like no other. My skin feels hydrated, but hydrated because the skin it&#x27;s self is happy and healthy not because a product on top of my skin making it feel hydrated. Each day that I use this product my skin looks brighter and fuller and healthier. Now, the absolute best thing about this product is the Sun protection. I don&#x27;t play around when it comes to the sun- I am so pale and burn so easy- sun screen is something I am dead serious about and I give this product my strong approval. SPF 30 is a pretty strong benefit coming out of the gate a lot of product will only do about SPF 15, so I liked this was a much higher number. What is best is that the product has Zinc Oxide in it - it is so hard to find a good product that absorbs into your skin and doesn&#x27;t break down your makeup that has zinc in it. Zine is a barrier- no UVA or UB rays get past it. Other sun screens act like reflectors that the rays go into your skin and then bounce off the product - which technically protects you but when you are very pale or have skin cancer run in your family- its just not a risk you want to take! I have used this product in rather strong sun and it protects- it really does. I was out for about 2 hours and didn&#x27;t get red and my freckles didn&#x27;t come out with to me proves I got my harmful rays to my skin. I know I am going on and on- but I am really impress with every thing about this product. I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review- and this is my long winded honest review. This is a holy grail product for me- &#x27;nuff said!roduct has Zinc Oxide in it - it is so hard to find a good product that absorbs into your skin and doesn&#x27;t break down your makeup that has zinc in it.

    <li> Too heavy on the face for me so I went back to using Lancome.</li>
    <li> Age: 57&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: slightly sensitive with slight rosacea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thick creamy emollient moisturizer with SPF 30. Can be used alone or under make up. Absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the serum in this vidi line and loved it so gave this cream a try. Have used it for over a month now and am very pleased. The consistency of the cream may look as if it is heavy, but use just a little and it smooths into the skin quite nicely, leaving your face soft and silky without a greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few SPF products I use that does well with my skin--no burning, breakouts, or itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way so the product should last me a while. I apply  it only for daytime use, though it&#x27;s rich enough for nighttime (but why &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; the SPF!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being out in the sun this summer a little too much, I can relate with confidence that the product protected my skin quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll purchase this moisturizer again.</li>
    <li> I ordered with the vitamin c serum. The two together are the best I have tried. My skin looks and feels more youthful, silky smooth. Tighter with diminished wrinkles, and also brighter.  Would order again...Also love the 30 spf... just enough even when outside all day.</li>
    <li> The texture almost feels like product for your hair.</li>
    <li> Feels great, smells great and does not feel greasy. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have tried A LOT of moisturizers from cheap to expensive. This is the only one I have bought more than once. I have combination and sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t significant cause blackheads or my skin to break out. It might be thick in the jar, but it goes on easily and it is weightless on your skin. I love it has SPF 30 and overall it is a great product. Also, one jar for me lasted from Sept to Jan. I use it every morning and on and off at night.</li>
    <li> I have used many face creams over the years. This is the absolute best. I love the aroma, the texture and what it does for my skin. I need to have a face cream with sun block and it fills that need as well. I love the way it absorbs without greasiness and leaves a velvety feel to my skin.</li>
    <li> This cream has a smooth silky texture, &amp; a very nice light pleasant scent.  I have very sensitive skin, but have had no issues whatsoever with this product.  I&#x27;ve only used it for about 1 week, but I&#x27;m quite happy so far.</li>
    <li> It made my face break out. Acne in my faces hours after applying it. Stopped using it. Disappointed cuz it is not cheap:(</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this cream on my face! I alternate between mineral makeup and Double Wear by Estee Lauder, both of which go on smoother on top of a great moisturizer. VIDI offers just the right amount of silkiness and moisture for these very matte makeups. I also have had skin cancer on my face so I must use a moisturizer with an SPF of at least 30. The facial sunscreen I use doesn&#x27;t have the great ingredients that this cream contains. I know, beeswax and carnuba wax was sound like it is for a car not a face, but they are excellent natural moisturizers. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Feels good on my skin and is not greasy at all. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Makes my face so soft, but not greasy/oily. I would highly recommend others to try it. n</li>
    <li> I finally found a wonderful daily moisturizer for my combination skin. Goes on nice with a luxurioush finish. I don&#x27;t find it thick or necessarily thin but just right consistancy... that sure enough combats my afternoon oily skin and works amazing with spf tested out fully while summertime boating!  Only about 2 weeks into using this product so hope to see the other benefits.</li>
    <li> my skin love this products</li>
    <li> While this will probably work for some women, I saw absolutely no improvement in my skin after 5 weeks of use.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again but don&#x27;t let my skin&#x27;s response keep you from trying it!</li>
    <li> Love the fresh smell. Perfectly fit my skin. But the cover is broken when arrived</li>
    <li> Just what I need....SPF and thick cream that vanishes into the skin quickly and keeps skin hydrated all day!</li>
    <li> I love this moustirizer, no more dry spots and no break outs and it smells fabulos.</li>
    <li> I love the VIDI products. I use the face moisture and also the Vit C serum.  They work very well together</li>
    <li> This lightweight facial moisturizer has the added benefit of SPF 30, so necessary for me, in a daytime facial cream.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this SPF moisturizing cream by VIDI Beauty and Skin care, in a promotion for personal use, honest&lt;br /&gt;evaluation and review.  This cream comes in a lovely jar, has a nice light scent, and is a thick ultra moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;antioxidant cream.  I feel comfortable and have been enjoying using the cream on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is amazing!!  It has a thick consistency and it smooths and firms my skin immediately.  I have only been using it for a few days, but it&#x27;s already made a difference in the texture and appearance.  Looking forward to even younger looking skin.  I just turned 60, and have used a lot of different products, all more expensive and this one works the best!  Just started using the serum also - and that is amazing as well.  Thanks for this great product!!</li>
