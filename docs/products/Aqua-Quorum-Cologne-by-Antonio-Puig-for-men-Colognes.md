      <li>The price and the quality of the Aqua Quorum spray for men is excellent.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fragrance is excellent.</li>
      <li>Especially good for office wear or in the summer.  </li>
      <li>They say memories are stored in scents, and well this scent was what I wore in highschool and it reminded me of the good times!</li>
      <li>Not that great</li>
      <li>Aqua Quorum is a great smelling cologne</li>
      <li>Item came on time and it great condition.</li>
      <li>It comes out smelling great but will not make it through an evening.  </li>
      <li>Aqua Quorom is a very nice cologne.</li>
      <li>Great scent, yet not over the top!</li>
      <li>It is good for daytime use.</li>
      <li>It smells good and doesn&#x27;t break the bank to buy it.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been great fans of Aqua Quorum for more than 10 years.</li>
      <li>Honest supplier</li>
      <li>Stronger and more manly than the popular aquatics of today.</li>
      <li>and I enjoy it too!</li>
      <li>My husband love the scent...</li>
      <li>,It smells better than Nautica Sport cologne for men.</li>
      <li>We both love the smell.</li>
      <li>This cologne is very good for daily use.</li>
      <li>It smells light and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product at anytime to anyone who is interested.</li>
      <li>The smell is not too strong.</li>
      <li>I love this cologne with its cool, alluring fragrance.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for either the great smell of the original Quorum, or the excellent late comer Quorum Silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Aqua&amp;#34; smells like soap, and pretty much cheap soap at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a teacher in Florida, and I love smelling fresh and clean every day, but some colognes tend to be too strong for the classroom.</li>
      <li>In this economy, that is not to be taken lightly.</li>
      <li>Aqua Q is very nice for invoking rememberances of summer all year long.</li>
      <li>Does not smell like Cool Water or Aqua Di Gio like another reviewer mentioned.  </li>
      <li>Anyhow, Aqua Quorum smells fresh and clean but without smelling synthetic or like laundry detergent.  </li>
      <li>, I am satisfied with this purchase, I recommend it for the one who seeks a classic scent.</li>
      <li>This little known fragrance, along with others from the House of Puig, can be had for a great price.</li>
      <li>This product is worth the money</li>
      <li>Aqua Quorum is just the right one to wear for me.</li>
      <li>My wife noticed it right away and said she likes it.  </li>
      <li>I really really love the scent of this product, the price is great, but the big (huge) drawback for me is that it is weak.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used it</li>
      <li>Its dry down is very nice; clean and fresh</li>
      <li>Recommended for short durations of activity, after shower additive to a fresh scent, or to spray the sheets for that special moment.</li>
      <li>My husband really likes the smell and so do I.</li>
      <li>I can still smell it on me after 6 hours of physical activity, and girls seem to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend checking out the original Quorum and Quorum Silver.</li>
      <li>I was expecting better from this product but it turned out to be just average.</li>
      <li>It is amazingly reminiscent of Cool Water, and Acqua Di Gio also.</li>
      <li>The shipment arrived on time, this fragrance is a classic</li>
      <li>Classic scent, smell like a boss</li>
      <li>and I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>However, anyone whose been around fragrances will immediately recognize this cologne as Cool Water&#x27;s long lost twin.</li>
      <li>I feel between the 3 you will have an appropriate fragrance year round.</li>
      <li>It is strong and long lasting like quorum and silver.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s more than ordinary one&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Natural and invigorating with an almost carbonated feel, give this stuff a try.  </li>
      <li>and I was surprised by&lt;br /&gt;the fragrance</li>

    <li> The perfum not is durable</li>
    <li> 100 % recomend excelent perfum</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived on time, this fragrance is a classic and I&#x27;ve used it before, and smells just as I remember it, I am satisfied with this purchase, I recommend it for the one who seeks a classic scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this EDT for daily use, specifically at work. I&#x27;m a teacher in Florida, and I love smelling fresh and clean every day, but some colognes tend to be too strong for the classroom. Aqua Quorum is just the right one to wear for me. Great scent, yet not over the top!</li>
    <li> Aqua Quorom is a very nice cologne. However, anyone whose been around fragrances will immediately recognize this cologne as Cool Water&#x27;s long lost twin. It is amazingly reminiscent of Cool Water, and Acqua Di Gio also. That is not to say it is a bad smell. Its dry down is very nice; clean and fresh is what you&#x27;re left with. Aqua Q is very nice for invoking rememberances of summer all year long. This little known fragrance, along with others from the House of Puig, can be had for a great price.

    <li> I have to say I am disappointed with the cologne I received today. After closely inspecting the bottle (comparing it with online original bottle and closely inspecting the quality of bottle ) I figured out it was a fake, also the smell wears out in minutes. I would not recommend this brand to anyone. I guess I had to take a hit with the price I spent on it, should have instead vested in a quality product.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a knock off.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> Quorum aqua is a horse of a different color.  It is strong and long lasting like quorum and silver. However it is a totally different type of scent.  It smells light and refreshing.  My wife noticed it right away and said she likes it.  Smells like a $60 cologne not a $13 cologne.</li>
    <li> This cologne is very good for daily use. The smell is not too strong. It is good for daytime use.</li>
    <li> Classic scent, smell like a boss</li>
    <li> Item came on time and it great condition. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product at anytime to anyone who is interested. Don&#x27;t be scared &amp;#34; BUY &amp;#34;. Honest supplier</li>
    <li> Husband put this on his Xmas list.  Smells like an expensive cologne, but inexpensive enough for every day. We both love the smell.</li>
    <li> Stronger and more manly than the popular aquatics of today. I can still smell it on me after 6 hours of physical activity, and girls seem to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend checking out the original Quorum and Quorum Silver. I feel between the 3 you will have an appropriate fragrance year round.</li>
    <li> Both Aqua Quorum and Polo Sport were colognes released in 1994 and smell extremely similar.  Does not smell like Cool Water or Aqua Di Gio like another reviewer mentioned.  Anyhow, Aqua Quorum smells fresh and clean but without smelling synthetic or like laundry detergent.  Natural and invigorating with an almost carbonated feel, give this stuff a try.  Especially good for office wear or in the summer.  Around $15 shipped, unbeatable deal.</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money and it&#x27;s fragrance is excellent. This is the first time I have used it and I was surprised by&lt;br /&gt;the fragrance,It smells better than Nautica Sport cologne for men.I will buy it again...and I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Quorum for an inexpensive cologne for work but decided to try this version for variety. It smells good and doesn&#x27;t break the bank to buy it.</li>
    <li> I was expecting better from this product but it turned out to be just average.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for either the great smell of the original Quorum, or the excellent late comer Quorum Silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Aqua&amp;#34; smells like soap, and pretty much cheap soap at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with Silver.</li>
    <li> They say memories are stored in scents, and well this scent was what I wore in highschool and it reminded me of the good times! I love this cologne with its cool, alluring fragrance. In highschool it was known as the panty dropper. Figure it out. &#x27;Nuff said. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Aqua Quorum is a great smelling cologne If you like Eternity or One by CK . The scent does not overwhelm.</li>
