### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
      <li>The best thing that could happen is I moved up to the WSP Silvertip.</li>
      <li>my son was very happy with this shaving brush</li>
      <li>The best shaves of my life to this point have been WSP Silvertip and Castle Forbes cream or DR Harris soap.</li>
      <li>If you have the best creme or soap you need the best brush.</li>
      <li>This brush is incredible.  </li>
      <li>The application is incredibly comforting and relaxing.</li>
      <li>This brush got great reviews on Badger and Blade forum.  </li>
      <li>I was looking around for a great brush, one that didn&#x27;t cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars.  </li>
      <li>Well, this is one great</li>
      <li>I figured the brush was a good place to manage cost</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good shaving brush..</li>
      <li>B004OJM9XE Semogue 620 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush]].</li>
      <li>Lathers up really nicely and exfoliates your skin preparing it for a nice shave!</li>
      <li>This is a good chance to get a great value and a great performing brush that will probably be a lifetime favourite  Simply fantastic quality.</li>
      <li>He said Amazon has great prices for top quality brushes like WSP.</li>
      <li>Still, the Monarch is a good value and if the handle were redesigned, it would be an amazing brush for around $100.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended with reservations.</li>
      <li>I am really enjoying this brush!</li>
      <li>lather this brush can generate is truly amazing, and the feel of the silver tip badger is unmatched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful brush and soft on the face with plenty of backbone, so whether a person face or bowl lathers, this one will work great.  </li>
      <li>Great brush, lathers well and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>I use Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream and it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>First off, this is a very nice brush.</li>
      <li>, just 100% OK.</li>
      <li>It feels great running against my face and it feels like it&#x27;s really doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, getting under the hairs and standing them up.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my second brush,  after using a $30 Parker Best Badger brush for over 2 years.  </li>
      <li>worth the money!!</li>
      <li>The slivertip badger hair is very soft and creates a great lather.</li>
      <li>It cannot be stated enough what a good quality brush will do for your shave routine!</li>
      <li>It is probably the most densely packed knot I own and the tips are really soft.</li>
      <li>that being said, it is a very nice brush, though I feel the knot should be a bit bigger for the price.</li>
      <li>The Monarch High Mountain White Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush is one of the best brushes in its price range that you can buy.</li>
      <li>While the brush is adequate for lathering, my Edwin Jagger bush is far superior.  </li>
      <li>After using a Pure badger brush prior to purchasing the &#x27;Monarch,&#x27; I must say that this brush is an incredible upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For me, this brush works best with a soft shave cream such as [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Once it&#x27;s loaded properly, I can easily get 3 or more passes from it and still be able to squeeze a handful of lather from it after I&#x27;m finished shaving.  </li>
      <li>(I use my other brushes just to apply water to my face at this point lol)</li>
      <li>I love the other brush because it&#x27;s wider and holds water incredibly well, however this one holds water just as well and is also nice and firm.  </li>
      <li>The handle is small but quite comfortable, and very nice looking.&lt;br /&gt;According</li>
      <li>Trust me, it is definitely worth the extra money to get a nice brush.</li>
      <li>He liked it so much he recently ordered The &amp;#34;Monarch&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The price is good compared to similar high end brushes.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you honestly, this brush has single handedly revolutionized my shaving experience!</li>
      <li>In the 60-80 dollar category this would be a 5 star product, but the fact that this brush is priced to compete with much higher quality types of brushes is what diminishes my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just had my first shave with the Monarch, and the difference is like night &amp; day.  </li>
      <li>You can feel the quality in the brush from just holding it and in person its a real looker!</li>
      <li>My only worry is every time I shave since I started using it more</li>
      <li>I waited a few weeks before writing the review to be fair to this brush.</li>
      <li>The hair holds far more water than I though it could and builds a lather that made my eyebrows raise in complete surprise.</li>
      <li>I can run hot water and re-lather two times easily and three times if necessary.</li>
      <li>This is a versatile brush, as it is floppy enough to bowl lather, has enough back-bone to whip up a very good facial lather.  </li>
      <li>I started with an escali pure badger brush.</li>
      <li>Knot is dense, and the loft is smartly managed.  </li>
      <li>Stiffer body and softer tips than my pure badger brushes.</li>
      <li>However, it is of high quality that feels nice on your face and seems to be keeping together pretty well, with some slight shedding every so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>to the reviews some people are having issues with the hair falling out of the knot, mine shed about 6 with the first shave 3 the second and nothing significant since.</li>
      <li>Though there are better ones for the price, keep in mind that this costs a hundred dollars because High Mountain White Badger hair is much rarer than normal silvertip.</li>
      <li>For those of you who wish to enjoy the shaving experience as much as I do and don&#x27;t mind making an investment for your future, this is the brush for you.</li>
      <li>so the difference is really the face-feel.</li>
      <li>I really like it though and think the softness and quality make up for the lack of backbone.</li>
      <li>Which is why you’re paying so much for it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gents who spend over $100 for a shaving brush are likely to want to upgrade to a Simpson or a Plisson, or a Rooney, so honestly, if I had it to do over again, I would have spent some more money at the start and purchased one of the aforementioned brushes.</li>
      <li>I tried to keep it cheap and cut corners where I could to limit my initial investment.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are very thirsty and hold a lot of water.</li>
      <li>it helps you get a very tick foam.</li>
      <li>I own a few brushes but, none of them high-end like this brush.</li>
      <li>You can read more extensive reviews on traditional shaving forums like the Shave Nook (which is where I first read about this</li>
      <li>/&gt;Simply put, it is OK, not exceptional and not bad</li>
      <li>Really adds a new sense of luxury to my shaving ritual.</li>
      <li>For face lathering, this brush is adequate, but I prefer to face lather with a Boar Bristle brush, such as the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>When I first got into wet double edge safely razor shaving</li>
      <li>so I bought a $12 highly rated brush heard in Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I have this brush and another silvertip badger brush and all I can say is this one is MUCH more firm.  </li>
      <li>I noticed many hairs in the sink after a few months.</li>
      <li>Although it really is truly a high-end brush I have not seen any significant advantage over my other brushes.</li>
      <li>In brief, if you&#x27;re willing to give the brush a few uses to reach its full potential, it will reward you with a fabulous shaving experience.</li>
      <li>He said it is very soft and lathers well.  </li>
      <li>This is the highest quality and most expensive brush I have and worth every penny - and quite a few dollars more.  </li>
      <li>Brush is very lightweight with a small head and has a cheap looking plastic handle.  </li>
      <li>It holds an unbelievable amount of warm water and massive lather.  </li>
      <li>It is certainly a luxury item, but for the daily wet shaver it is worth the money</li>
      <li>It has limited my desire to spend more $ to try other brushes.</li>
      <li>The hair is soft and flexible.</li>
      <li>I would recommend using this brush with a cream, not a soap, since it is so soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft and luxurious....</li>
      <li>It holds water so well that sometimes I have to give it a squeeze to keep from having too much water in it, especially for some of the shaving creams.  </li>
      <li>It is scrubby, but soft as a summer cloud.  </li>
      <li>hair is the High Mountain White silvertip badger.  </li>
      <li>short I would certainly recommend getting a WSP brush I bought two and am thinking that I will probably aquire another in the hopefully near future.</li>
      <li>I am afraid it will get bold en of this year :)</li>
      <li>It takes a few uses for the bristles to reach a full spread.</li>
      <li>I have experienced very little shedding, though a few strands have come loose.</li>
      <li>I had read some reviews of Wet Shaving Products&#x27; Monarch High Mountain White Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush, so I had to see for myself if all the rave was real or just hype.  </li>
      <li>I am definitely glad I went a little and got the &amp;#34;Monarch&amp;#34; over the other alternatives.</li>
      <li>The bristles from the first day have been very soft, it shed a few hairs at the start, but has since stopped.</li>
      <li>The only thing that is not the same is I will buy high quality shaving products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not a bad purchase for the price, though I would not recommend that this be your first nice high-end brush.</li>
      <li>I would have expected a brush that costs this much to last much longer.  </li>
      <li>once the brush gets wet it blossoms out to a huge round head and never looks back.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am really enjoying this brush! It is probably the most densely packed knot I own and the tips are really soft. The handle is small but quite comfortable, and very nice looking.&lt;br /&gt;According to the reviews some people are having issues with the hair falling out of the knot, mine shed about 6 with the first shave 3 the second and nothing significant since. So maybe 10-12 hairs total, definately not a problem especially when you consider how densely the hair is packed in.&lt;br /&gt;In short I would certainly recommend getting a WSP brush I bought two and am thinking that I will probably aquire another in the hopefully near future.</li>
    <li> my son was very happy with this shaving brush</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for approximately 5 months now.  It continues to shed 5-10 hairs every day.  I have started collecting them and have started to fill a zip lock bag.  If it keeps shedding at its current rate, I expect I&#x27;ll have to replace it within the year.  I would have expected a brush that costs this much to last much longer.  I would not recommend buying this brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shaving brush.. it helps you get a very tick foam. My only worry is every time I shave since I started using it more than a month ago I lose hair.. I am afraid it will get bold en of this year :)</li>
    <li> Losing bristles STILL!  I know how to prep a brush. This one is not a good value for the price. Keep shopping!</li>
    <li> I was looking around for a great brush, one that didn&#x27;t cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars.  Well, this is one great brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is the High Mountain White silvertip badger.  It holds an unbelievable amount of warm water and massive lather.  Knot is dense, and the loft is smartly managed.  This is a versatile brush, as it is floppy enough to bowl lather, has enough back-bone to whip up a very good facial lather.  It is scrubby, but soft as a summer cloud.  Just big enough too.  It&#x27;s done everything I have asked it to...soaps, creams, sticks, face, bowl, hand, and scuttle lathers.  This is already my favourite brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think, if you are hesitating, don&#x27;t.  This is a good chance to get a great value and a great performing brush that will probably be a lifetime favourite  Simply fantastic quality.</li>
    <li> Hairs still falling out after 1/2 year of daily usage.</li>
    <li> The Monarch High Mountain White Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush is one of the best brushes in its price range that you can buy. The handle is less ergonomic than I like, but as they say: YMMV.  The bristles from the first day have been very soft, it shed a few hairs at the start, but has since stopped. For me, this brush works best with a soft shave cream such as [[ASIN:B002O7UI18 C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil 147g/5.2oz]] and bowl lathered. The bristles are very thirsty and hold a lot of water. With a total height of 101mm, the brush is average in length and while Badger Brushes aren&#x27;t known for their \\&quot;backbone\\&quot;, the Monarch isn&#x27;t a wimp. For face lathering, this brush is adequate, but I prefer to face lather with a Boar Bristle brush, such as the [[ASIN:B004OJM9XE Semogue 620 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush]]. Gents who spend over $100 for a shaving brush are likely to want to upgrade to a Simpson or a Plisson, or a Rooney, so honestly, if I had it to do over again, I would have spent some more money at the start and purchased one of the aforementioned brushes. Still, the Monarch is a good value and if the handle were redesigned, it would be an amazing brush for around $100.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended with reservations.</li>
    <li> I just returned from a tour in Afghanistan and wanted to treat myself. I initially thought that i would not really be able to tell the difference between this brush and the $12 one I have been using for the past 2 years. Needless to say, I am writing this so others will take the leap and step out of their financial comfort zones.The hair is soft and flexible. I have experienced very little shedding, though a few strands have come loose. The hair holds far more water than I though it could and builds a lather that made my eyebrows raise in complete surprise. It is certainly a luxury item, but for the daily wet shaver it is worth the money and I will purchase one for my son as a gift once i teach him to shave.</li>
    <li> Given the previous reviews and the cost of this item, I was disappointed.  Brush is very lightweight with a small head and has a cheap looking plastic handle.  While the brush is adequate for lathering, my Edwin Jagger bush is far superior.  Save your money and select another brand.</li>
    <li> Really adds a new sense of luxury to my shaving ritual. I would recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their shave.</li>
    <li> Stiffer body and softer tips than my pure badger brushes.</li>
    <li> I got this brush for Christmas.  It&#x27;s my second brush,  after using a $30 Parker Best Badger brush for over 2 years.  Just had my first shave with the Monarch, and the difference is like night &amp; day.  It&#x27;s so soft and luxurious.... I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
    <li> I had read some reviews of Wet Shaving Products&#x27; Monarch High Mountain White Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush, so I had to see for myself if all the rave was real or just hype.  Well, this is my go-to brush now.  It holds water so well that sometimes I have to give it a squeeze to keep from having too much water in it, especially for some of the shaving creams.  Once it&#x27;s loaded properly, I can easily get 3 or more passes from it and still be able to squeeze a handful of lather from it after I&#x27;m finished shaving.  It&#x27;s a beautiful brush and soft on the face with plenty of backbone, so whether a person face or bowl lathers, this one will work great.  It&#x27;s not one of the largest brushes or handles, but it performs like a larger one.  I would recommend this brush, especially for the value compared to some more expensive ones out there.</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving about 40 years. The last few months I have gone back to the way my father did. The only thing that is not the same is I will buy high quality shaving products. I started with an escali pure badger brush. My dad used boar bristle. I noticed many hairs in the sink after a few months. The best thing that could happen is I moved up to the WSP Silvertip. The best shaves of my life to this point have been WSP Silvertip and Castle Forbes cream or DR Harris soap. If you have the best creme or soap you need the best brush. WSP Hi Mountain is your brush.</li>
    <li> Trust me, it is definitely worth the extra money to get a nice brush. It&#x27;s so dense and holds lots of water and lather. I would recommend using this brush with a cream, not a soap, since it is so soft. I use Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream and it works perfectly. Overall I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> First off, this is a very nice brush. Though there are better ones for the price, keep in mind that this costs a hundred dollars because High Mountain White Badger hair is much rarer than normal silvertip. Which is why you’re paying so much for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, it is a very nice brush, though I feel the knot should be a bit bigger for the price. Disagree with me all you will, but that is simply how I feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad purchase for the price, though I would not recommend that this be your first nice high-end brush. However, it is of high quality that feels nice on your face and seems to be keeping together pretty well, with some slight shedding every so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the best, and definitely miles away from being the worst, but somehow this brush just doesn’t quite feel like it should cost a hundred dollars. In the 60-80 dollar category this would be a 5 star product, but the fact that this brush is priced to compete with much higher quality types of brushes is what diminishes my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, it is OK, not exceptional and not bad, just 100% OK.</li>
    <li> Great brush, lathers well and dries quickly.  I have not lost any bristles yet..  Seems to hold up well.</li>
    <li> I hate to post a one star review but I&#x27;ve had this brush for almost two years and hair still falls out of it. Just about every time I shave. It&#x27;s so expensive that I&#x27;ve continued to just use it, piss poor investment!</li>
    <li> I own a few brushes but, none of them high-end like this brush. Although it really is truly a high-end brush I have not seen any significant advantage over my other brushes. I have used this brush with several types of soap - cakes, creams, tube, essential oils but, there has been no significant advantage over my other brushes. However, I still like it but, I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money to buy it again. It has limited my desire to spend more $ to try other brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush is incredible.  It&#x27;s crazy soft on your face and lathers really well.  It doesn&#x27;t have a ton of backbone so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re in to you may want to look for something else.  I really like it though and think the softness and quality make up for the lack of backbone.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this for my husband and he loves it.  He said it is very soft and lathers well.  He likes the size. This brush got great reviews on Badger and Blade forum.  He liked it so much he recently ordered The &amp;#34;Monarch&amp;#34; Premium Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush.  He said Amazon has great prices for top quality brushes like WSP.</li>
    <li> After using a Pure badger brush prior to purchasing the &#x27;Monarch,&#x27; I must say that this brush is an incredible upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather this brush can generate is truly amazing, and the feel of the silver tip badger is unmatched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks before writing the review to be fair to this brush. The price is good compared to similar high end brushes. For the first few uses, I had a concern that it wasn&#x27;t holding the water and the shave cream. The bristles are short. Not close to the length of bristles on my other high end shave brush, Eshave. It takes a few uses for the bristles to reach a full spread. Once that happened, this brush holds an enormous amount of water and shave cream. I can run hot water and re-lather two times easily and three times if necessary. In brief, if you&#x27;re willing to give the brush a few uses to reach its full potential, it will reward you with a fabulous shaving experience.</li>
    <li> This is the highest-quality made-in-China brush I&#x27;ve seen. The slivertip badger hair is very soft and creates a great lather. I&#x27;ve been lathering with a brush for awhile, and the hair in this compares favorably to the higher-end brushes from Art of Shaving and others, at a fraction of the price. You can read more extensive reviews on traditional shaving forums like the Shave Nook (which is where I first read about this brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the long silvertip hairs have some body when wet, if you tend to press a lot when lathering consider the stubby brushes as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for 4 years and have 4 different brushes.  This is the highest quality and most expensive brush I have and worth every penny - and quite a few dollars more.  The picture is deceptive- once the brush gets wet it blossoms out to a huge round head and never looks back.  It does take longer to dry (because of all the hairs packed in) so I would recommend getting a brush stand if you don&#x27;t have one already (currently offered with the brush).  Incredibly soft but firm , no smell, no loss hairs, - now what do I do with the cheaper brushes?</li>
    <li> It cannot be stated enough what a good quality brush will do for your shave routine! You can feel the quality in the brush from just holding it and in person its a real looker! Lathers up really nicely and exfoliates your skin preparing it for a nice shave! Give this brush a shot and throw away all those other ones! (I use my other brushes just to apply water to my face at this point lol)</li>
    <li> When I first got into wet double edge safely razor shaving I tried to keep it cheap and cut corners where I could to limit my initial investment.  I figured the brush was a good place to manage cost so I bought a $12 highly rated brush heard in Amazon.  After a few week I just wasn&#x27;t getting the shaving experience I was hoping for and I determined it was for two reasons, a bad lather and uncomfortable lathering experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and found some mixed reason about WSP but I figured I would give them a shot as they their brushes are assembled here in the US and they are a smaller, family owed company.  Let me tell you honestly, this brush has single handedly revolutionized my shaving experience! The lathers are think and heavy. The application is incredibly comforting and relaxing. I am definitely glad I went a little and got the &amp;#34;Monarch&amp;#34; over the other alternatives. For those of you who wish to enjoy the shaving experience as much as I do and don&#x27;t mind making an investment for your future, this is the brush for you.</li>
    <li> I have this brush and another silvertip badger brush and all I can say is this one is MUCH more firm.  I love the other brush because it&#x27;s wider and holds water incredibly well, however this one holds water just as well and is also nice and firm.  It feels great running against my face and it feels like it&#x27;s really doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, getting under the hairs and standing them up.  It also builds a lather as well if not a little bit better than my other silvertip badger, but then again I don&#x27;t think any silvertips are really bad at that so the difference is really the face-feel.</li>
    <li> Packed with badger hair .&lt;br /&gt;Awsome . As described .</li>
