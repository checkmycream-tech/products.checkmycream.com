      <li>Worth 4x the money!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a deep, woodsy smell, but, it is by far the BEST cologne I have ever smelled on a man.</li>
      <li>Absolutely one of my favorites that I&#x27;ve been around in many years.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear much spray, but I love this.</li>
      <li>As for the item Black is a great colonge.</li>
      <li>, i was pretty excited to see it out of the box</li>
      <li>Fresh scent, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>on two occasions, out of the many days worn, somebody asked if I was wearing some cologne because they could just barely smell it</li>
      <li>Kenneth Cole Black does a good job of covering up my B.O.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I ordered it as a gift but will more than likely buy one for myself as well</li>

      <li>i love it because i can use everyday, everytime and whatever time is to what i like like smells now</li>
      <li>and they were right next to me.</li>
      <li>This product was much cheaper than purchasing from a store and for its size, it will probably last me over two years.  </li>
      <li>First thing I don&#x27;t like was that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but it smells a bit different from my old bottle.</li>
      <li>I would be careful however if this item doesn&#x27;t come shipped in its original packaging--I have heard complaints of people receiving watered down products.  </li>
      <li>Genuine article at about half the price sold by other stores.</li>
      <li>Very watered down.</li>

<li> I wondered if it was watered down or not.</li>
<li> it was a much bigger container than i normally get, but unfortunately when i sprayed it on my body all i got was the scent of watered down nail polish .......if you plan on buying this be prepared for Disappointment because it does not smell anything like Kenneth cole black.</li>
<li> It lost the subtle sweetness it used to have.</li>
<li> but by then it&#x27;s so weak</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns for flammable items so you are out of luck if you receive a tampered version.  </li>
<li> I wear it casually and for out for the evening.</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my husband for Valentines Day and he loved it.It smells so good I could eat him up when he wears it :-).Would definetly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It was purchased as a gift, which he loved and said &amp;#34;this is just to much for you to spend&amp;#34;.  He did not know the great price I got through Amazon....</li>
    <li> just ok..better quality product i got from macys</li>
    <li> Contacted seller twice and still haven&#x27;t received item. They responded once saying they would find out why, but haven&#x27;t heard back for a few months. As for the item Black is a great colonge.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of Kenneth Cole and this is great, the bottle is much bigger than the one I purchased at Burlington Coat Factory.</li>
    <li> Fresh scent, not overpowering. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.... But hey everybody does their own thing!!</li>
    <li> It seems ok, holds it&#x27;s fragrance and I would recommend this due to it&#x27;s price!</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned about purchasing something on amazon, this was my first, I thought the bottle of Black was going to be a used bottle or even one of those knock offs but when it arrived it was the real thing and I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I thought i would try to buy this stuff on amazon seeing as it keeps dissappearing when i go to the store. I really like the cologne and have been using it for quite some time, i was pretty excited to see it out of the box cause it was a much bigger container than i normally get, but unfortunately when i sprayed it on my body all i got was the scent of watered down nail polish .......if you plan on buying this be prepared for Disappointment because it does not smell anything like Kenneth cole black.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved this spray when we were at the Kenneth Cole outlet so he is receiving it for Christmas!</li>
    <li> A few women had spoke very well of this cologne. First thing I don&#x27;t like was that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I wondered if it was watered down or not. Will probably never know but I bought this same size bottle from another vendor here on Amazon (both ordered through Amazon). Same results. One was from Amazon and the other from some fragrance company. It smells good while it lasts which is about 4-6 hours but by then it&#x27;s so weak you have to plant your nose in the area to smell it. Other colognes I have bought from the store last all day and I get compliments on. These two bottles I have put on 5-6 squirts every time and on two occasions, out of the many days worn, somebody asked if I was wearing some cologne because they could just barely smell it and they were right next to me. Don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> Awesome cologne with an unbeatable price, not overpowering or obnoxious smell. I ordered it as a gift but will more than likely buy one for myself as well</li>
    <li> Amazing and distinct cologne....I get nothing but compliments.  I used to use KC signature, but they discontinued it so this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> My son loves this scent and after his first bottle was stolen by someone who also liked it, I decided to get him some for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling cologne that I have, not to mention all the compliments I recieve when I where it.</li>
    <li> i love it because i can use everyday, everytime and whatever time is to what i like like smells now this is my point</li>
    <li> Smells very nice.  My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> I love Kenneth Cole Black and cannot find it at the department stores anymore.  This was true to its scent and a great price</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my husband and he loved it!!!! I love this smell too,  I do recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Very watered down. I would never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely one of my favorites that I&#x27;ve been around in many years.  Bought for a friend for Christmas, will see what he thinks.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product, it comes when it says it will, and I am very pleased!  Glad I don&#x27;t have to go find it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as expected and on time. Price was about 1/2 of what you&#x27;d pay in a department store. Scent was what my wife loves on me.</li>
    <li> Not overpowering but a stand-out! I wear it casually and for out for the evening. The scent lasts and is not alcohol-smelling.</li>
    <li> Great price. Genuine article at about half the price sold by other stores. Extremely happy with this and will be sure to order this from you again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear much spray, but I love this. Not over powering and sticks around for the entire 8 hour work day. Great price to the quantity and quality.</li>
    <li> Great product for  the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shower very often Kenneth Cole Black does a good job of covering up my B.O.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> i ran out so i came on amazon to get more.</li>
    <li> My fiance wear this all the time; it&#x27;s her annual Christmas present. It smells so good! I&#x27;ll always buy this specific cologne.</li>
    <li> This product meets my expectations</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like it used to. I can&#x27;t stand when my boyfriend sprays it . I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this scent personally.</li>
    <li> This product, while we tried it at the store, did not end up smelling as nice as we had hoped. My husband used it up, but we didn&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
    <li> First off, Kenneth Cole Black is one of the manlier smelling colognes I have tried and I love it.  This product was much cheaper than purchasing from a store and for its size, it will probably last me over two years.  I rate this product a perfect score because it shipped promptly, it was wrapped in its original packaging, and it is one of the best manly smelling colognes out there (IMO).

Unfortunately, Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns for flammable items so you are out of luck if you receive a tampered version.  If it helps, I purchased from Red Label Outlet USA without any problems.  I usually have no problems buying directly from Amazon, but I suggest for this one try buying from another third party like I did.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loved this!</li>
    <li> Great item fast shipping</li>
    <li> gift for my husband. Love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it smells a bit different from my old bottle. It lost the subtle sweetness it used to have. It lost its distinction, it smells like any other cologne. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product</li>
    <li> This product smells just like Polo Blue by Ralph Lauren, though it doesn&#x27;t last as long. It&#x27;s a deep, woodsy smell, but, it is by far the BEST cologne I have ever smelled on a man. Worth 4x the money!</li>
