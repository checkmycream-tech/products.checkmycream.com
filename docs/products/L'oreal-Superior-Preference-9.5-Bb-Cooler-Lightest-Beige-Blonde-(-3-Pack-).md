    <li> Been using for years.....I stock up regularly to be sure I have in case it is discontinued</li>
    <li> This what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> Perfect color! Always consistent and pretty. Not brassy or orange.like ash shades. Also colors gray well. Comes with an excellent conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have not used the product from the current order. Since I have ordered the same product prior to this and had very good luck I would assume the product will be fine as well. I greatly appreciate that I can obtain this product that I can no longer find locally.  It has been an easy, prompt and very satisfactory process so far.</li>
    <li> Color seemed a bit off but not much.  Other than that it was a good Loreal product.</li>
    <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal Preference for many, many years now and my hair is in excellent condition.  I always get the desired color and have had many compliments on it.  At my age (70&#x27;s) the new gray hair is a different texture but it colors exactly the same as the rest of my hair.  Thanks L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color for years and I love it.  I was so happy to find it on line since they no longer have it in any of the stores.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this color anywhere else.  It&#x27;s the only one I use.  Thank you, thank you, thank you</li>
    <li> Was my favorite color and as usual they decided not to make it anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this color.  I don&#x27;t seem to be able to find it in any stores.  I tried Light Ash Blonde, but it wasn&#x27;t the same result, so I was very happy to find it here.  I hope it continues to be available.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon.com!  I have been using this color for years and it is perfect for me.  However, as other reviewers have said, you cannot find it in the store.  I finally called L&#x27;Oreal and they said they had discontinued this shade &amp;#34;because beige colors are not popular&amp;#34;.  Well, I think there are plenty of us out here who would disagree.  Please keep carrying this shade.  I just love that I can find things on Amazon that I can&#x27;t find anywhere else.  You&#x27;re the best.</li>
    <li> This product does the job.  Lightens my dark blond hair exactly as box demonstrates.  Conditioner included keeps my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Can not find this anywhere in retail stores anymore. So happy with it</li>
    <li> great product  and hard to find in stores using this color for years and wont change. Love Loreal</li>
    <li> My Mom&#x27;s favorite color! She is 94.</li>
    <li> I have been using this color for years.  When I could not find it on the shelves at local stores and even stores outside my neighborhood I thought that I would have to go back to paying the pricey salon fees for my hair.  I hope L&#x27;oreal isn&#x27;t think inking of discontinuing this color......it&#x27;s the only color that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair brassy.  I will definatly purchase again</li>
    <li> great color and can&#x27;t find it at any stores so have to order it.</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Preference hair color.  I use Champaigne Blonde and have never had a problem with it.  I just ordered a box a week ago and I believe the vendor was Strunk&#x27;s.  I am posting here because the hair color I received was what I ordered except that it was in their old box which they stopped selling about 3 years ago.  I just used it yesterday and even though it was very old I still got the same excellent results that I always get with Preference.  I knew when I applied it that I was taking a chance on having to redo my hair, but, I am an old risk taker and this risk paid off.  My hair looks great.  But, beware of Strunks!</li>
    <li> Preference is the best for grey coverage. I have used this color for over 15 years and is now no longer available in stores. The closest color to it is the 10NB which I like also. My coloring will last longer than the normal 6 weeks with this product, and I never can get the color that looks natural like this at a salon.</li>
