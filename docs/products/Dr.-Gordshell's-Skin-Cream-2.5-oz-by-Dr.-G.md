<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife swears by it.</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old now and have been using this all my life. My parents used it on me and now me on my own family. It has so many uses and really works. It helped get a few stones out of my knee from a bike accident. It has helped countless pimples and whatnot come to a head. It really is a amazing cream. 1 jar last for what seems like forever.I have had just 1 jar for probably a good 10 years LOL and just finally had to buy a new one. Defintly worth the cost. A little goes a long way and you only need a little.</li>
    <li> I have used this most of my life (I am 62 years old) ever since a bicycling accident and a friend of my mom recommended it to her to use on me.  It has pushed out splinters and takes the pain out (most of the time) overnight. I have not been able to find it in the local stores so I have been forced to use other creams....and I have not been happy with these other creams.  Can not wait to receive my bottle of \\&quot;Gordshell&#x27;s Salve\\&quot; as we called it in our household...is it here YET??</li>
    <li> I have a skin rash that will not go away.  My sister recommended Dr. Gordshell&#x27;s skin cream.  I still have the rash.</li>
    <li> I have used Dr. Gordshell&#x27;s Skin Cream for many years.  I could not purchase this product in any drug store in South Carolina.  I was happy I found it on Amazon</li>
    <li> My 3 year old has eczema so badly on her left arm since she was an infant - we have tried all kinds of creams/meds etc. We put this on the rash in the evenings before she goes to bed - it has been 7 days and it is clearer than I have ever seen it! So grateful for the referral - this cream is awesome!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my daughter&#x27;s skin condition.  It works better and faster than the medicine that was prescribed from her pediatrician.</li>
    <li> Cleared up dry skin spot in no time!</li>
    <li> We have always used it, but was having a hard time finding were to buy it.</li>
    <li> My therapist told me to use this for some psoriasis I had on my elbows! Now I use it on all weird dry skin for my whole family!!! Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this when the 6 oz jar was available. I am using it for everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a household staple in my youth, and I am in my 60s now. It&#x27;s one of those things you just have to have. Antibiotic creams don&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as this does. One dab, and a bandaid, and anything heals up practically overnight. Red? Infected?  This takes all the redness and heat out, draws out the infection and leaves the skin like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with Roseacea, try this. Smear it on, and in a few minutes you will be able to scrape the top layer of the inflamation off your face. I think it kills demodex mites, or at least destroys their \\&quot;nests\\&quot; that they live in allowing you to scrape them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty good on skin fungal infections too...along with a fungicide. Not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAJOR Thanks to the folks who resurrected this product after they stopped making it. It is really appreciated,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another old-fashioned remedy that works is Boric Acid. A pinch in salt water will clear up eye problems, and can be sprinkled around (not with kids or pets) if you have a roach or ant invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also started to use vinegar (10%) to clean with.

    <li> This skin cream works. Been around for a very long time and is still the best.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent cream.  It does everything it advertises it does. I will purchase it again when this jar is finished.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing product.  My grandfather applied it in the 1960s to my infected fingernails.  It drew the infection out with no lancing or doctor visit.  It&#x27;s still the same.  I had no idea you could still get it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL SALVE THAT I WANTED!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Came in mail quick and in a hurry. I&#x27;ll be getting more soon.</li>
    <li> No medicine cabinet is complete without this! So glad I was able to purchase on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product works so well.  Don&#x27;t go putting on a huge wound, but for small scrapes....wow! Worth every cent.  Don&#x27;t like the lard though, but I get over that because it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Lucked up on this in a local drug store and now I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Has great healing properties for dry/cracked skin.</li>
