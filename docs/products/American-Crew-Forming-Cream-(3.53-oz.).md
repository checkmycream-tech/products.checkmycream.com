### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and this stuff is the best!</li>
      <li>the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for some time now and it is just perfect for us Men.</li>
      <li>I decided to rate this item because I found to be the best hair styling product I have yet tried.</li>
      <li>It had a great hold and the perfect amount of shine.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>and I think this is a great pomade/hair gel.</li>
      <li>This is very handy if you travel often like I do.  </li>
      <li>good stuff</li>
      <li>The cream holds amazingly all day.</li>
      <li>Great product, works well, and cheap</li>
      <li>But then I got to thinking, if this is a rampant problem on Amazon then there is no way to tell which reviews are honest and which have been bought.</li>
      <li>The Forming Crew has excellent hold and doesn&#x27;t make hair very shiny, if at all.</li>
      <li>You might want to try that if you are looking for a strong hold!</li>
      <li>If you need more wipe and repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unlike the aforementioned spray, this forming cream is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>day/night healthy shine.  </li>
      <li>way better than was expecting , love it</li>
      <li>Criticism aside, this forming cream is the perfect consistency for most hairstyles, and will keep your hair just the way it is set, and washes out with basic rinse.</li>
      <li>You have to get the roots really good and try not to put to much on the top because your hair will just not stay up.</li>
      <li>You have to style while you put it in, as it won&#x27;t let you run your hands easily through your hair once its in.</li>
      <li>I wish that I had paid better attention to the size info (this was a mini version and thus not such a great deal afterall).</li>
      <li>It all washes out really easy in the shower when you&#x27;re done.    </li>
      <li>The smell is clean....not strong and doesn&#x27;t get in the way of colone.</li>
      <li>It has an excellent hold and does wonders for shorter hair that tends to stick up at odd places.</li>
      <li>; I will say that I haven&#x27;t been happy with generic products of this type, so the brand can be trusted.    </li>
      <li>used it sparingly so far, but good price, doesn&#x27;t leave the hair crispy, etc...</li>
      <li>Now, normally I would just find this amusing and ignore it.</li>
      <li>But I originally gave it a 3/5.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my fly away hair, and most products don&#x27;t work well for it.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t harden when it dries so it gives an awesome natural, \\&quot;out-of-the-shower\\&quot; look for several hours (as in 7 or 8 hours).</li>
      <li>Pretty strong aroma, fine if you like it.</li>
      <li>It works great if I&#x27;m styling my hair more &amp;#34;professionally&amp;#34; or going for the messy look.</li>
      <li>The product is as stated, smells pleasant enough and does what it says.</li>
      <li>It also has a good hold but not as strong as expected.</li>
      <li>but the smell is a bit strong at first.  </li>
      <li>Again, the price is great compared to other products.</li>
      <li>Smells good and holds hair nicely in place without getting hard.</li>
      <li>I have used Gatsby strong hold (Pink) wax and it works many times better and sometimes too well that it feels and looks like glue.</li>
      <li>It also holds up for the whole day and is easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>Best product for wavy dry coarse hair!!!</li>
      <li>and I should have tried that in the first place.</li>
      <li>while still not BLATANTLY LOOKING like I have something in my hair.</li>
      <li>It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too shiny or stiff - allowing me to style my hair</li>
      <li>I think it works best when my hair is still a little wet, but not soaking.  </li>
      <li>Came fast and exactly as stated</li>
      <li>It adds a mild hold that makes your hair look natural</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really have scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works so much better if you put it in while your hair is wet then blowdry it into your hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still experimenting with how much product is needed.  </li>
      <li>This forming cream is really good for my black medium thickness and about two inches long on top and short on the sides.</li>
      <li>Especially just after I&#x27;ve had a haircut, this is a great product to tame it all</li>
      <li>The first order was clear.  </li>
      <li>It did a decent job as a styling cream but nothing to rave about.</li>
      <li>It smells decent, but the smell goes away after an hour.</li>
      <li>The forming cream, while not being touted as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; works far better than the Burt&#x27;s Bees gel or any other gel for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My last personal favorite was the now discontinued Burt&#x27;s Bees natural hair gel for men.  </li>
      <li>For people with fine hair, this may work but I am going to try other products and will not return.</li>
      <li>I would have given this a five star rating, but do to the high cost, relative scarcity, and only available at a max of 3 oz.</li>
      <li>wish the wording was a little more clear.</li>
      <li>It reminded me of those old fashioned men&#x27;s hair styling lotions</li>
      <li>3 weeks (depending on how much you need; I have short spiky hair).</li>
      <li>Looks natural and stays in place all day.  </li>
      <li>American crew fiber was alright but didn&#x27;t have much hold.</li>
      <li>and wow, this stuff does what I&#x27;ve been wanting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-No flaking so far.  </li>
      <li>were offering me a full refund if I took down my &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34</li>
      <li>And if I&#x27;m lazy in the morning and haven&#x27;t showered yet I can still go out since yesterday&#x27;s cream is still holding strong.</li>
      <li>My hair looks like I have no product on but with a clean firm hold.</li>
      <li>If you do want to do spikes just put it in the hair when it&#x27;s still really damp after a towel dry.    </li>
      <li>I find it doesn&#x27;t spread easily through out hair if your hair isn&#x27;t a bit moist at least.</li>
      <li>I can only describe it like old shoe polish.  </li>

<li> I can only describe it like old shoe polish.  </li>
<li> Holds just right with a bit of slick back mildly wet look.  </li>
<li> I have medium-long hair that&#x27;s also pretty thick, so its been a challenge finding something that will keep my hair in-place and get rid of the friz,</li>
<li> It is waxy and keeps short, thick hair in place for the whole day.</li>
<li> I have ordered this item before and this one was not a good as the first order.  </li>
<li> The shine is only slightly shinier than what the American Crew Shampoo and Conditioner gives me.</li>
<li> Just put a tiny pea-sized amount in your hands when your hair is only slightly damp and style like you want.</li>
<li> It is a musky smell that isn&#x27;t overbearing or harsh but is definitely not typical of hair products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
<li> but I switched to other products and only used this as a backup.</li>
<li> I rub a little on both hands and work it through my hair and then brush it back with a hand-held hair drier.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair appear greasy nor dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only used a product this well for my hair one other time, the redken rough clay.</li>
<li> So far a very small amount goes a LONG way.  </li>
<li> After I&#x27;ve finished dressing in the morning, I then rough up the hair, use a little &#x27;shine,&#x27; and then brush it back again.  </li>
<li> Not really in reference to the product, but because I won&#x27;t tolerate a seller trying to bribe me.</li>
<li> Wipe your finger over the product, wet your hands and product, work through your hair.  </li>
<li> My hair is a bit thick and stiff and it struggles to hold it up or in a style even with hair spray unless I put 4-5 large pea-sized applications into my hair.</li>
<li> Previous gels eventually looked dry or like I wasn&#x27;t wearing anything.&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different hair gels over the past 30 years and even a few hair sprays back in the 80&#x27;s, do they even make Stiff Stuff anymore?  </li>
<li> It keeps even my thick hair in the basic shape I want with that small amount.</li>
<li> This is just perfect....a little dab on the palm of my hand</li>
<li> I have short, thin, curly hair.......</li>
<li> but it still dried in a way I didn&#x27;t like and made my hair look dull.    </li>
<li> ; review (is 3/5 really that bad?).</li>
<li> It is really hard to wash out of your hair and leaves a residue on your scalp.</li>
<li> I have medium length thick hair</li>
<li> It is not inexpensive, but a very small \\&quot;dab&#x27;ll do ya.\\&quot;  </li>
<li> I was shocked when I woke up the next morning</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pretty strong aroma, fine if you like it. Works well.</li>
    <li> Dint like the texture.</li>
    <li> I have shorter but curly/wavy hair.  Especially just after I&#x27;ve had a haircut, this is a great product to tame it all so my hair looks well-groomed.  It is not inexpensive, but a very small \\&quot;dab&#x27;ll do ya.\\&quot;  I rub a little on both hands and work it through my hair and then brush it back with a hand-held hair drier.  After I&#x27;ve finished dressing in the morning, I then rough up the hair, use a little &#x27;shine,&#x27; and then brush it back again.  Looks natural and stays in place all day.  Can be touched up by just brushing it back again.    Would have rated it 5 stars but for the price; I will say that I haven&#x27;t been happy with generic products of this type, so the brand can be trusted.    Italian guy</li>
    <li> the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells good and holds hair nicely in place without getting hard.</li>
    <li> I have medium-long hair that&#x27;s also pretty thick, so its been a challenge finding something that will keep my hair in-place and get rid of the friz, while still not BLATANTLY LOOKING like I have something in my hair. First I tried hair gel but it flaked off disgustingly after it dried and just gave me an annoying spike look. Then I tried mousse and that didn&#x27;t flake but it still dried in a way I didn&#x27;t like and made my hair look dull.    Now I got this stuff and wow, this stuff does what I&#x27;ve been wanting. Just put a tiny pea-sized amount in your hands when your hair is only slightly damp and style like you want. It keeps even my thick hair in the basic shape I want with that small amount. It also doesn&#x27;t harden when it dries so it gives an awesome natural, \\&quot;out-of-the-shower\\&quot; look for several hours (as in 7 or 8 hours). The shine is only slightly shinier than what the American Crew Shampoo and Conditioner gives me. It all washes out really easy in the shower when you&#x27;re done.    If you do want to do spikes just put it in the hair when it&#x27;s still really damp after a towel dry.    Just be deliberate when you put it in your hair. This is not a product where you put it in your hair, THEN style. You have to style while you put it in, as it won&#x27;t let you run your hands easily through your hair once its in.</li>
    <li> Works as well as you would expect forming cream to. It is waxy and keeps short, thick hair in place for the whole day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my fly away hair, and most products don&#x27;t work well for it. American crew fiber was alright but didn&#x27;t have much hold. The Forming Crew has excellent hold and doesn&#x27;t make hair very shiny, if at all. It has an excellent hold and does wonders for shorter hair that tends to stick up at odd places. I&#x27;ve only used a product this well for my hair one other time, the redken rough clay. However, that&#x27;s been canceled, but this works just as well.</li>
    <li> I have short, thin, curly hair.......and this stuff is the best! Worth every penny! My hair looks like I have no product on but with a clean firm hold. The smell is clean....not strong and doesn&#x27;t get in the way of colone.</li>
    <li> The cream holds amazingly all day. And if I&#x27;m lazy in the morning and haven&#x27;t showered yet I can still go out since yesterday&#x27;s cream is still holding strong. It works great if I&#x27;m styling my hair more &amp;#34;professionally&amp;#34; or going for the messy look. It works so much better if you put it in while your hair is wet then blowdry it into your hair. I find it doesn&#x27;t spread easily through out hair if your hair isn&#x27;t a bit moist at least.</li>
    <li> used it sparingly so far, but good price, doesn&#x27;t leave the hair crispy, etc...Again, the price is great compared to other products.</li>
    <li> Purchased for traveling and will refill from the larger container when needed.  Pricing was inline with expectations, would purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this very slowly for almost an year. I began to use it but I switched to other products and only used this as a backup. I find it feeling a bit oily/greasy but it still has a matte finish. The hold is low-medium. My hair is a bit thick and stiff and it struggles to hold it up or in a style even with hair spray unless I put 4-5 large pea-sized applications into my hair. It smells decent, but the smell goes away after an hour. For people with fine hair, this may work but I am going to try other products and will not return. I have used Gatsby strong hold (Pink) wax and it works many times better and sometimes too well that it feels and looks like glue. You might want to try that if you are looking for a strong hold! American Fiber is also stronger than this and I should have tried that in the first place.</li>
    <li> I would have given this a five star rating, but do to the high cost, relative scarcity, and only available at a max of 3 oz. size, I can only give 4 stars. Criticism aside, this forming cream is the perfect consistency for most hairstyles, and will keep your hair just the way it is set, and washes out with basic rinse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different hair gels over the past 30 years and even a few hair sprays back in the 80&#x27;s, do they even make Stiff Stuff anymore?  Unlike the aforementioned spray, this forming cream is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used.  My last personal favorite was the now discontinued Burt&#x27;s Bees natural hair gel for men.  It worked well but simply didn&#x27;t last and my last tube was just about gone when I looked for a replacement.  The forming cream, while not being touted as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; works far better than the Burt&#x27;s Bees gel or any other gel for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-All day/night hold with no crispy hair feeling.  I was shocked when I woke up the next morning and my hair looked fine.&lt;br /&gt;-All day/night healthy shine.  I like my short hair to have a bit of a shine, not grease shine but enough to help darken up my hair.  Previous gels eventually looked dry or like I wasn&#x27;t wearing anything.&lt;br /&gt;-No flaking so far.  I&#x27;m still experimenting with how much product is needed.  So far a very small amount goes a LONG way.  I can only describe it like old shoe polish.  Wipe your finger over the product, wet your hands and product, work through your hair.  If you need more wipe and repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to say this is a con but the smell is a bit strong at first.  You get used to it and my wife didn&#x27;t mind.  It is a musky smell that isn&#x27;t overbearing or harsh but is definitely not typical of hair products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for some time now and it is just perfect for us Men. Not into all that jell or spray stuff. This is just perfect....a little dab on the palm of my hand and I&#x27;m all set. Great product.</li>
    <li> I did not like this Forming Cream.  It is really hard to wash out of your hair and leaves a residue on your scalp.</li>
    <li> I have medium length thick hair and I think this is a great pomade/hair gel. It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too shiny or stiff - allowing me to style my hair however I want.  I think it works best when my hair is still a little wet, but not soaking.  It also holds up for the whole day and is easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> It adds a mild hold that makes your hair look natural</li>
    <li> Crew is my brand of product. Holds just right with a bit of slick back mildly wet look.  good stuff</li>
    <li> This is very handy if you travel often like I do.  Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in the 1QT ziploc bag currently required for carry-on fluids and has enough product to last for approx. 3 weeks (depending on how much you need; I have short spiky hair).</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell. It reminded me of those old fashioned men&#x27;s hair styling lotions so I only used it once. It did a decent job as a styling cream but nothing to rave about.</li>
    <li> When I bought the American Cream I was under the impression that it came with twp 3 oz jars not 2 1.75 oz jars.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the wording was a little more clear.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well, and cheap</li>
    <li> way better than was expecting , love it</li>
    <li> I have ordered this item before and this one was not a good as the first order.  The first order was clear.  The gell in this one was different.</li>
    <li> Best product for wavy dry coarse hair!!!</li>
    <li> I decided to rate this item because I found to be the best hair styling product I have yet tried. This forming cream is really good for my black medium thickness and about two inches long on top and short on the sides. It had a great hold and the perfect amount of shine. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair appear greasy nor dry. It also has a good hold but not as strong as expected. You have to get the roots really good and try not to put to much on the top because your hair will just not stay up. This product doesn&#x27;t really have scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Came fast and exactly as stated</li>
    <li> I wish that I had paid better attention to the size info (this was a mini version and thus not such a great deal afterall).</li>
    <li> Beware of size. This is almost a sample size.</li>
    <li> The product arrived 2 days later than stated upon checkout. Not a big deal, not like it&#x27;s much-needed meds or anything. But I originally gave it a 3/5. The product is as stated, smells pleasant enough and does what it says. Not the greatest thing in the world, but by no means the worst. Then I received an email from CB Select.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were offering me a full refund if I took down my &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; review (is 3/5 really that bad?). Now, normally I would just find this amusing and ignore it. But then I got to thinking, if this is a rampant problem on Amazon then there is no way to tell which reviews are honest and which have been bought. So I&#x27;m changing my review to 1/5. Not really in reference to the product, but because I won&#x27;t tolerate a seller trying to bribe me.</li>
