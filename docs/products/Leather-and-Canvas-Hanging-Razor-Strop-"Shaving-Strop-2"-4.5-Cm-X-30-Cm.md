<ol>
      <li>This is an excellent Strop.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect size and performs well.</li>
      <li>- that said it is a very nice strop</li>
      <li>That being said, it&#x27;s a very nice strop and works well.</li>
      <li>, this is a good quality strop.</li>
      <li>The leather portion was not even a leather that is good for a strop</li>
      <li>Glancing at the title, I saw the terms 3&amp;#34; and strop and thought I was good to go.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice belt.</li>
      <li>At first, thought I found a great deal.</li>
      <li>My Damascus Straight Razor was polished quickly and holds an excellent edge.</li>
      <li>I recommend using a measurement converter Online to know better, what they are selling.</li>
      <li>It is more like 1.75-inches wide.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>This strop was shipped promptly and packaged appropriately.  </li>
      <li>The product came today and it looks like it&#x27;s ok,</li>
      <li>It is the size most recommended in Europe.</li>
      <li>If I was 3ft tall with a razor to match this would be perfect, as it is I can only suggest to not buy it.</li>
      <li>The description needs to be better per my husband</li>
      <li>Great Strop, would highly recommend</li>
      <li>I own three strops, A full length strop (barber), A Juchien Solingen (with a tightening rod) and this one.</li>
      <li>Seemed like a pretty good price for a 3&amp;#34; stop, so I bought it.  </li>
      <li>Three inches wide would be wonderful!  </li>
      <li>This strop is made of very supple, good quality leather.</li>
      <li>Should you travel, it is easily packed.</li>
      <li>Just a little longer would be nice, but it is a nice strop with good leather.</li>
      <li>The linen side is also great and the bindings/attachments seem to be very solid and well made.</li>
      <li>this strop is great considering it has a cotton side and leather side, i would definitely recommend this for beginners.</li>
      <li>and I know cheap belly hide when I see it.  </li>
      <li>Cheap thrash.  </li>
      <li>Cheap belly</li>
      <li>It seems rather cheaply made, too.  </li>
      <li>The razor seems to glide easily on the leather and the FROMM Dressing helped break in quickly.</li>
      <li>First!</li>
      <li>All in all I would highly recommend this for someone who wants a good strop on a tight budget, however if you can afford to spend more</li>
      <li>Its fabric side is decent, but either way, it is a good one to learn on, or at least one that will hold you over until you save up for a better one.</li>
      <li>You will spend about this much and have a tool that is far more usable.</li>
      <li>I typed in the Amazon search for a 3&amp;#34; strop; this very one appeared as the #1 hit on the list</li>
      <li>Looked just like the item I paid three times as much for.</li>
      <li>Very Dissapointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But anyway, it hones well, and also helps you figure your x pattern better for more expensive strops.</li>
      <li>if you expect it The  4 cm× 30 is not an American measurementit&#x27;s a lot more smaller than 3 inch and length:it shouldn&#x27;t say 3 inches in front of 4 cmx30cmit&#x27;s misleading</li>
      <li>However, on second use the straight razor cut almost right through rhe leather when I was cleaning it.</li>
      <li>This strop is only about 1.75 inches wide, so you&#x27;ll need to use a steady X pattern while stropping with most normal sized straight razors which is not recommended for beginners.</li>
      <li>It is also a bit too short, I&#x27;d really like at least another two or three inches for a good functional surface.</li>
      <li>I assumed that since the tittle of the product says &amp;#34;Shaving Strop 3&amp;#34;, that the strop would actually be a normal 3&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>this price I would recommend this...buy a good wide leather belt and get a piece of tight weave untreated canvas ...hot glue them together.</li>
      <li>IT CLEARLY STATES THAT</li>
      <li>I am going to stop by the saddle shop and get some leather and sacrifice some old khakis.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
      <li>and it came completely damaged.</li>
      <li>if it is even large enough to properly perform the sharpening task it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
      <li>They use a very good technique to trick you idiots into thinking that it is a 3&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>my personal perspective is that my mother is a professional barber and this strop looks like the \\&quot;runt of the litter\\&quot; compared to hers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve done extensive leather-crafts in my adult life</li>

<li> It is only about 1 3/4&amp;#34; wide; it&#x27;s also too short.</li>
<li> The cloth side also was not good for a straight razor and actually damaged mine.</li>
<li> It really is only one and three quarters of an inch wide.</li>
<li> One three quarter inch wide chinese junk.&lt;br</li>
<li> the razor strap was smaller than expected.  </li>
<li> Nice strop - but 4.5 cm is not  3 inches - disappointed in product</li>
<li> Seems like instead of 3&amp;#34; wide, it&#x27;s about 1.5&amp;#34; wide.  </li>
<li> I was expecting a 3&amp;#34; wide strop, but that wasn&#x27;t the case:</li>
<li> wide.</li>
<li> It is NOT 3-inches wide.  </li>
<li> This strop is NOT 3-inches wide.  </li>
<li> said wide is 4.5cm</li>
<li> the width is 1 3/4 inches wide or two razors side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used both sides and they work and feel a little different that the other one I have.</li>
<li> Both keeps my razor sharp.</li>
<li> its to NARROW to use correctly and is falling apart</li>
<li> But this does mean that the leather isn&#x27;t too bad because the price would lead you to believe the leather is cheap,</li>
<li> I fail to understand the complaints that this strop is either too short or too narrow.</li>
<li> The leather is so bad I cant even verbalize and it was so hard that I took the edge right off my razor</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if the title is intentionally misleading or accidentally misleading, but I would not buy it again.</li>
<li> The leather seems to be of an acceptable grade, but again...it is small.</li>
<li> You will see that it is a VERY NARROW</li>
<li> To give you an idea of you take out your Razor and open it up the working area is 2.5 inches longer than your razor fully extended or 12 inches, the advertised claim of a 3 inch width is either a seriously bad joke or</li>
<li> sad</li>
<li> sad</li>
<li> Sorry I bought.</li>
<li> poor !  </li>
<li> How unfortunate for me.  </li>
<li> I feel this strop isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
<li> Horrible all around</li>

    <li> The product came today and it looks like it&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t know yet if it is even large enough to properly perform the sharpening task it&#x27;s intended for. my personal perspective is that my mother is a professional barber and this strop looks like the \\&quot;runt of the litter\\&quot; compared to hers. The leather seems to be of an acceptable grade, but again...it is small. To give you an idea of you take out your Razor and open it up the working area is 2.5 inches longer than your razor fully extended or 12 inches, the advertised claim of a 3 inch width is either a seriously bad joke or 3 inches means something completely different in china...the width is 1 3/4 inches wide or two razors side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Tested the strop, it only covers 1/2 the blade and you have change to a diagonal stroke to cover the entire blade.&lt;br /&gt;For this price I would recommend this...buy a good wide leather belt and get a piece of tight weave untreated canvas ...hot glue them together. You will spend about this much and have a tool that is far more usable. If I was 3ft tall with a razor to match this would be perfect, as it is I can only suggest to not buy it. I am going to stop by the saddle shop and get some leather and sacrifice some old khakis. lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent Strop. For price and quality. I own three strops, A full length strop (barber), A Juchien Solingen (with a tightening rod) and this one. I fail to understand the complaints that this strop is either too short or too narrow. It is the perfect size and performs well. It is the size most recommended in Europe. Should you travel, it is easily packed. As for price, you can find the similar item in London, as I was amused to see, for 59 quid.</li>
    <li> Great Strop, would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Just a little longer would be nice, but it is a nice strop with good leather.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my 2 1/2&amp;#34; strop, and found out that this was not the 3&amp;#34; strop that it claimed to be. Not only that, but this was the poorest quality strop I have ever seen. I would never put my razor on this!</li>
    <li> Cheap thrash.  One three quarter inch wide chinese junk.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money on this product.  Sorry I bought.</li>
    <li> I assumed that since the tittle of the product says &amp;#34;Shaving Strop 3&amp;#34;, that the strop would actually be a normal 3&amp;#34; razor strop. It is only about 1 3/4&amp;#34; wide; it&#x27;s also too short. Do not buy this product for a razor. I contacted the seller (from China) and he told me,&amp;#34;The item I listed said wide is 4.5cm and length is 30cm on title.I didn&#x27;t said it is 3inch wide.&amp;#34; ……really? I asked him what the 3 inches in the title meant but he won&#x27;t respond.</li>
    <li> it s 3 inches 4 .cm×30 cm but its not a 3-inch if you expect it The  4 cm× 30 is not an American measurementit&#x27;s a lot more smaller than 3 inch and length:it shouldn&#x27;t say 3 inches in front of 4 cmx30cmit&#x27;s misleading</li>
    <li> Three inches wide would be wonderful!  However, I was so surprised that it was not as wide as the product description said it was. How unfortunate for me.  It really is only one and three quarters of an inch wide.</li>
    <li> When searching for a 3 inch leather strop, this came up as a result.  I know why it did.  Keywords would be [3&amp;#34; leather strop].  Glancing at the title, I saw the terms 3&amp;#34; and strop and thought I was good to go.  Seemed like a pretty good price for a 3&amp;#34; stop, so I bought it.  I should have left it alone.  Seems like instead of 3&amp;#34; wide, it&#x27;s about 1.5&amp;#34; wide.  It seems rather cheaply made, too.  I&#x27;m not sure if the title is intentionally misleading or accidentally misleading, but I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The leather is so bad I cant even verbalize and it was so hard that I took the edge right off my razor</li>
    <li> NO ONE should be complaining about the size of this strop.  They use a very good technique to trick you idiots into thinking that it is a 3&amp;#34; strop!!  If you look at it again closely you will notice that the title is in QUOTES!!!!!  Immediately followed by the SIZE of the strop.  IT CLEARLY STATES THAT THIS CRAPY STROP IS ONLY 4.5cm.  Look at any type of measuring instrument that has both SAE and METRIC.  You will see that it is a VERY NARROW strop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST IDIOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> poor !  its to NARROW to use correctly and is falling apart</li>
    <li> Nice strop - but 4.5 cm is not  3 inches - disappointed in product - that said it is a very nice strop</li>
    <li> I was expecting a 3&amp;#34; wide strop, but that wasn&#x27;t the case: it&#x27;s 1 3/4&amp;#34; wide. That being said, it&#x27;s a very nice strop and works well.</li>
    <li> this strop is great considering it has a cotton side and leather side, i would definitely recommend this for beginners.</li>
    <li> This strop was shipped promptly and packaged appropriately.  The strop did not have creases or any type of nicks on the leather.  This product met my expectations.</li>
    <li> At first, thought I found a great deal. Looked just like the item I paid three times as much for. However, on second use the straight razor cut almost right through rhe leather when I was cleaning it. Tossed it day two.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. It works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Not a 3\\&quot; strop. Very Dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking to return these.&lt;br /&gt;Fail&lt;br /&gt;Fail&lt;br /&gt;Fail&lt;br /&gt;Fail&lt;br /&gt;Fail&lt;br /&gt;Ver sad they don&#x27;t know what they sell.&lt;br /&gt;Very sad</li>
    <li> I feel this strop isn&#x27;t too bad. First! It is only an inch and some change, not three. But this does mean that the leather isn&#x27;t too bad because the price would lead you to believe the leather is cheap, being you think it is a 3\\&quot; strop. But anyway, it hones well, and also helps you figure your x pattern better for more expensive strops. Its fabric side is decent, but either way, it is a good one to learn on, or at least one that will hold you over until you save up for a better one.</li>
    <li> the razor strap was smaller than expected.  the description on the web site didnt do the justice.  The description needs to be better per my husband</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of not converting the metric measurements to standard until I received it. The metric dimensions are correct, but 4.5 cm is not 3 inches.</li>
    <li> The strop was not what I was expecting at all. The leather portion was not even a leather that is good for a strop and it came completely damaged. The cloth side also was not good for a straight razor and actually damaged mine. Horrible all around</li>
    <li> This is a nice belt. I&#x27;ve used both sides and they work and feel a little different that the other one I have. The razor seems to glide easily on the leather and the FROMM Dressing helped break in quickly. I have it attached to a towel prong in the washroom. I can use different tensions this way depending on the Razor. My Damascus Straight Razor was polished quickly and holds an excellent edge.</li>
    <li> This strop is made of very supple, good quality leather. The linen side is also great and the bindings/attachments seem to be very solid and well made. All in all I would highly recommend this for someone who wants a good strop on a tight budget, however if you can afford to spend more I would go with something larger, as this one is pretty small. This strop is only about 1.75 inches wide, so you&#x27;ll need to use a steady X pattern while stropping with most normal sized straight razors which is not recommended for beginners. It is also a bit too short, I&#x27;d really like at least another two or three inches for a good functional surface. Size aside though, this is a good quality strop.</li>
    <li> This strop is NOT 3-inches wide.  I say again.......It is NOT 3-inches wide.  It is more like 1.75-inches wide.&lt;br /&gt;When I typed in the Amazon search for a 3&amp;#34; strop; this very one appeared as the #1 hit on the list provided.&lt;br /&gt;The Chinese seller was a jerk about providing a refund and wanted me to pay for shipping back to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done extensive leather-crafts in my adult life and I know cheap belly hide when I see it.  That is what this is made of....Cheap belly hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of those China boys will try and give &amp;#34;Metric&amp;#34; measurements on their stuff that they are trying to peddle-off on us.  I recommend using a measurement converter Online to know better, what they are selling.</li>
    <li> This works as it should.  I also purchased the oil with the strop.  Both keeps my razor sharp. I recommend.</li>
