      <li>I&#x27;ll never use any other kind of brush!!!!  </li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but nothing special.</li>
      <li>For all my years I have been using those cheapy drugstore hairbrushes, and thought they were just fine.  </li>
      <li>Light and easy to use</li>
      <li>Grabs hair the best and is so fun to dry hair because of the brush&#x27;s light weight.</li>
      <li>This brush truly, truly, makes a huge difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair and have used many different types of brushes over the years and this has been the best brush I have ever purchased.</li>
      <li>I really love the bristles AMAZING, and how big the diameter is, great for a soft blowout to add volume.</li>
      <li>This brush leaves my frizzy curly hair sleek and smooth after blow drying.</li>
      <li>The best round brush.  </li>
      <li>It makes your hair so smooth....</li>
      <li>Great finishing brush as well as overall brush</li>
      <li>After some research, I found that boars hair is good for helping to distribute natural oils.</li>
      <li>Feels wonderfully light in the hand and pulls cleanly and smoothly and works well with blow dryer.</li>
      <li>It is nice and lightweight, but personally, I get better results with a $10 brush I bought at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I can completely deliver an amazing blowout on my clients...every time.</li>
      <li>My stylist recommended this brush to me and the boar hair does an amazing job at pulling the natural oils through from roots to end without ripping out my tresses.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s straight, smooth, and polish!</li>
      <li>This brush has helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>It is also very lightweight and easy to hold and use without straining your hand or arm.</li>
      <li>I can do a perfect blowout on my thick hair!</li>
      <li>And now I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
      <li>Worth every</li>
      <li>now make my own shampoo bar, rinse occasionally with apple cider vinegar for shine, and use this brush to blow out my hair.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>well worth the money.</li>
      <li>worth every penny</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny</li>
      <li>Worth the $$$</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them easy to use.</li>
      <li>This brush is so easy to hold and use while you are trying to blow out your hair yourself, it doesn&#x27;t get stuck and is so smooth and fluid.</li>
      <li>I have never had a boar bristle brush and it gives a nice blow dry result.</li>
      <li>Since I was trying to get away from commercial shampoos that strip the oils, this property was very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to anyone who blowdryers their hair out straight!</li>
      <li>My first real hairbrush!  </li>
      <li>This is my first boar bristle brush.</li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews but this  brush is SO worth the effort :)  Not to sound shallow</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been losing some hair recently so someone recommended bore bristles in order to be more gentle with my hair.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, long hair and the Ibiza brush transforms my hair into thicker looking hair with so much body and shine.</li>
      <li>I gave the large one to my daughter-in-law who has shoulder length hair.  </li>
      <li>I ordered two Ibiza brushes - the large round brush and the medium round brush, because without seeing them I couldn&#x27;t tell which one would be the best for my shortish hair.  </li>
      <li>The brush works really well.</li>
      <li>Grips hair very well.</li>
      <li>Received fast.</li>
      <li>straight that is course and color treated.</li>
      <li>I really couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I didn&#x27;t want to spend this much money on a hair brush.</li>
      <li>It makes doing my hair much easier....</li>
      <li>Really like for my straight shoulder length hair</li>
      <li>I will for sure be getting other sizes too.</li>
      <li>For $48 I expected this brush to be nothing short of amazing</li>
      <li>But beyond that, its well made, it will last for many years with proper care.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have long, thick hair.  Why did it take me so long to find this brush?  Actually, I had no idea it existed until I read in a magazine.  My hair has THE best blow outs, I don&#x27;t even need to use a straightener.  For some reason, my hair takes LESS time to dry with this brush.  Buy it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s expensive on Nordstroms website.</li>
    <li> Very Pleased with my purchase Great brushes I highly recommend them easy to use. I would buy more brushes soon!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but nothing special. I feel it was not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a high-quality brownie with three times the amount of bristles on other brushes. It provides a high tension you blow drying hair so it&#x27;s straight, smooth, and polish! It is also very lightweight and easy to hold and use without straining your hand or arm. Would recommend this to anyone who blowdryers their hair out straight!</li>
    <li> best brush ever.  worth every penny</li>
    <li> Great finishing brush as well as overall brush</li>
    <li> Why did I not buy this brush earlier in my life? I thought that forty dollars seemed a bit extreme for a hair brush. But, you use the thing everyday, it works so well, it actually gets through to the scalp and it does do amazing blowouts. But beyond that, its well made, it will last for many years with proper care. Its a game changer.</li>
    <li> I do round brush blow dry&#x27;s on almost all my clients. This brush leaves the hair bouncy and shiny! I have used brushes from the beauty supply stores but I have never had any other round bush give the sleek, smooth, shine that this brush did. I don&#x27;t use any other brush now.</li>
    <li> This brush is absolutely amazing.  Light and easy to use but the bristles catch the hair and hold on to it in a good way.  You do not have to worry about frizz with this brush.  It makes your hair smooth and gorgeous!  No need for tons of products either.  Just an all around AMAZING BRUSH!  I will make the investment into other sizes.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful brush. I have fine but thick curly hair. Brushing curly hair is a disaster BUT when the humidity is low I can blow my hair straight with this brush. My hair looks shiny and  it is manageable. THis is pricy for a hairbrush but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed in this brush. It is nice and lightweight, but personally, I get better results with a $10 brush I bought at Sally&#x27;s. I feel like returning it.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair shiny.  Takes a little while to dry your hair since natural bristles but end result is worth it. I use this brush when I have more time.  Received fast. Good quality brush.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft. I would like to try an even larger one d/t my long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional stylist. This brush is amazing! Creates fullness, body, smoothness and shine. Expensive and totally worth it. A must have brush</li>
    <li> This is my go-to brush when I round brush my hair now!  Perfect for my medium length fine hair.</li>
    <li> After a month the bristles started melting.</li>
    <li> The brush works really well. Keeps my hair in place so when I dry it the results are that that my hair is straight.</li>
    <li> This brush had been a game changer in my natural hair care routine. I have been trying for over a year to find a natural hair care routine without harsh commercial shampoos. After some research, I found that boars hair is good for helping to distribute natural oils. Since I was trying to get away from commercial shampoos that strip the oils, this property was very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now make my own shampoo bar, rinse occasionally with apple cider vinegar for shine, and use this brush to blow out my hair. I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair everyday (sometimes I&#x27;ll do a dry shampoo), but I use this brush everyday.  If I just let me hair air dry, it can feel a little matted at the roots. However, when I section off my hair and round brush it out with this brush, it leaves my hair very manageable.  I never thought I could have such soft, shiny (and non greasy) hair without harsh commercial hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair, but with the light weight design my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired when using it. I have used it every day for a month, some days with high heat for extended periods, and I have not experienced any problems with bristles falling out. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but this  brush is SO worth the effort :)  Not to sound shallow but I might even say this brush is life changing!!  It makes your hair so smooth....like you just left a salon.  Perfect on wet hair.....grabs the hair and makes the blow dry so easy.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend....well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great brush! My hair has improved dramatically. I never would have guessed that a brush would actually make such a difference in the health of my hair, but it really did! Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I didn&#x27;t want to spend this much money on a hair brush. And now I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I&#x27;ve recommended this brush to everyone and thrown away all of my other round brushes. My hair is shiny and smooth and curls perfectly with this brush. The cork makes it light weight which is great for my carpal tunnel. I only wish that the handle were a tad wider to make it easier to hold. I plan on buying the other sizes offered.</li>
    <li> This brush has a very hard time going through my hair.  It gets stuck trying to round brush while drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type.  Arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever for blow drying hair straight that is course and color treated.</li>
    <li> The comfort of the brush handle is wonderful! It dries my hair faster and with less breakage. I have natural curly hair and have used many different types of brushes over the years and this has been the best brush I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ibiza brushes forever.  They are the best brush on the market.  They make your hair shine and give it body and bounce.  I have very fine, long hair and the Ibiza brush transforms my hair into thicker looking hair with so much body and shine. I will not use any other brush on my hair. Ibiza.com is an amazing company and their customer service is one of the best I have dealt with on Amazon.  I highly recommend Ibiza.com and all their brushes.</li>
    <li> I ordered two Ibiza brushes - the large round brush and the medium round brush, because without seeing them I couldn&#x27;t tell which one would be the best for my shortish hair.  I gave the large one to my daughter-in-law who has shoulder length hair.  She loves it because of the handle which is very comfortable to hold, and because it makes her hair very smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Grabs hair the best and is so fun to dry hair because of the brush&#x27;s light weight. Creates beautiful body and natural shine</li>
    <li> I will never use another brush again. I have thin fine asian hair that gets oily and goes flat throughout the day even when I blow dry. My stylist recommended this brush to me and the boar hair does an amazing job at pulling the natural oils through from roots to end without ripping out my tresses. 11/10 would recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I can do a perfect blowout on my thick hair! Worth every penny</li>
    <li> This brush is a game changer. I can completely deliver an amazing blowout on my clients...every time. I will for sure be getting other sizes too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush and I feel like I got a salon blowout when I use it.  It leaves my hair with a lot of body and not weighted down in any way. I have never had a boar bristle brush and it gives a nice blow dry result.</li>
    <li> I always wondered why I could never replicate a salon blowout at home. Same shampoo/conditioner/styling products... Turns out, it is the brush! I really couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. Worth the $$$</li>
    <li> This is my first boar bristle brush. I did a lot of research before making my purchase and found that Ibiza is the go-to brand for round brushes. I was not disappointed! This brush leaves my frizzy curly hair sleek and smooth after blow drying. You will LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Grips hair very well. No frizz. Best brush I ever used.</li>
    <li> My first real hairbrush!  For all my years I have been using those cheapy drugstore hairbrushes, and thought they were just fine.  I don&#x27;t know what came over me, but I saw the ad for this hairbrush and thought I would give it a try.  It&#x27;s magical!  It makes doing my hair much easier....plus it makes the ends shine.  So now I don&#x27;t have any straw looking hair on my little head.  My hair is managable, shiny, and makes me have mostly good hair days.  I am thinking about buying another one, a different size.  Don&#x27;t hesitate for a moment, this ones a winner.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this brush because it was so expensive.  However, I am so glad I did!!! I had other round brushes and I just couldn&#x27;t find one that really gave me lift and enough control while using it.  This brush is so easy to hold and use while you are trying to blow out your hair yourself, it doesn&#x27;t get stuck and is so smooth and fluid. I really love the bristles AMAZING, and how big the diameter is, great for a soft blowout to add volume.</li>
    <li> great brush- it is the only one i would use and recommend it for everyone - it gives the best result</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever owned! I&#x27;ve been losing some hair recently so someone recommended bore bristles in order to be more gentle with my hair. This brush has helped tremendously. I&#x27;ll never buy another brand again.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderfully light in the hand and pulls cleanly and smoothly and works well with blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after reading all the five star reviews.  After two attempts at using this brush I am sending it back.  I simply can&#x27;t get it to smoothly brush through my thick wavy hair at all.(t literally got stuck!  Makes styling my hair even more difficult than it needs to be.  For $48 I expected this brush to be nothing short of amazing and it was a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Excellent and light weight. Really like for my straight shoulder length hair</li>
    <li> This brush is AHMAZING. I was SOO skeptical when I saw the reviews but NO it is a miracle. I am in my 20&#x27;s but I have fine thin blonde hair which is highlighted and I have been religiously using a vented conair cheapo brush for years thinking a brush is a brush. I also had an incident where I got a vented round brush stuck in my hair. It was a mess. This brush truly, truly, makes a huge difference in my hair. I dont know how it does it, maybe its magic, maybe its some sort of spanish engineering, i dont know i dont care, because this brush has transformed my fine thin hair into a nice volumized mane its never flat now even without product. Its just a worthwhile investment. Its a hair brush and it changed my beauty routine. I want more of them!</li>
    <li> This is a really great brush!  Worth every cent!&lt;br /&gt;I would definetly recommend this brush for women with long, curly hair!</li>
    <li> The best round brush.  Period.  And I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  My hairstylist used this on me and I had to get one because it was the smoothest blowout I&#x27;d ever had.  The price seems a little steep, but believe me, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot of money for a brush. I honestly see difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Great quality.  Easy on the hands and styles my hair perfectly!! Recommended!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone with fine limp hair like mine. Using it to blow dry gives my hair bounce and shine, and no need for a flat iron or curling iron. My hair was recently chemically damaged from over processing at my salon. I don&#x27;t know how this brush does it, but it makes my hair look and feel healthy, thick and vibrant! It&#x27;s well worth the extra money spent on it! I&#x27;ll never use any other kind of brush!!!!  I SIMPLY LOVE IT!!!!!!!!</li>
