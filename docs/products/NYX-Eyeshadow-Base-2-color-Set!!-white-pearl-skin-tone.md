<li> Wow is all I can say this product is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
<li> They&#x27;re very nice products but the only concern I had was that the skin tone eyeshadow base was not sealed.</li>
<li> tan color is fairly dark for my skin tone, and I&#x27;m pretty dark for a white lady.</li>
<li> Both of these make my eye shadow pop and stay for a very long time.</li>
<li> I will not recommended unless your skin is very dry</li>
<li> The color was not very opaque and did not do the job.  </li>
<li> you get hair every where you get wet.</li>
<li> White pearl has a slight glitter to it as well!</li>
<li> But A Little Goes A Long Way.</li>
<li> But Other Than That</li>
<li> It seemed more like an eyelid moisturizer than an eyeshadow base.</li>
<li> The white one is really sparkly, which is too bad because I don&#x27;t always want to wear sparkles.&lt;br</li>
<li> I was looking for some good but not too expensive base shadow.</li>
<li> Amazing , the white base is a shimmery base didn&#x27;t expect that</li>
<li> So I Have To Use A Small Brush To Apply It</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have the pearl white eyeshadow base but instead the skin tone one, I wanted to get the pearl white one.</li>
<li> when putting eye shadow is hard to blend.</li>
<li> I am a Dog groomer, working at a small shop, that being said it&#x27;s a messy dirty job</li>

    <li> This is a must have, every makeup lover needs to use this, it keeps the eye shadow on or in my case I use the NYX powder Pigments and it looks and stays on amazingly!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the pearl white eyeshadow base but instead the skin tone one, I wanted to get the pearl white one. But  the year which was last year (yes I still have my skin tone one! never go anywhere with out it) it was out of stock. Let me tell you how good this product is. I am a Dog groomer, working at a small shop, that being said it&#x27;s a messy dirty job you get hair every where you get wet. I use this product under my eyeshadow along side a Smashbox cream shadow in riches and then urban decays primer in Sin, What I get even after my skin just feels coated in oil or it could be god knows what else. Is a monstrously good hold. I have applied this as early as 8 in the morning by 5 pm sure my make up in certain areas doesn&#x27;t look as fresh but my eyeshadow on my lids still looks like i just applied it. Great product I bought it in 2013 highly recommend</li>

    <li> The Product Itself Is Pretty Small But A Little Goes A Long Way. I Have Acrylic Nails On So I Have To Use A Small Brush To Apply It But Other Than That It&#x27;s Makes My Eyeshadow More Vibrant And Makes It Last Longer. It&#x27;s Also A Good Deal For 2 Shades !!</li>
    <li> Both of these make my eye shadow pop and stay for a very long time. I will definitely be repurchasing for the simple fact that it is not sticky like some primers and it works well at the same time.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the results of the product.  I never thought it would make a big difference on how smooth eyeshadow would look.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very nice products but the only concern I had was that the skin tone eyeshadow base was not sealed. Otherwise I really am satisfied with the products. They apply very nicely to the eyelids.</li>
    <li> Only got it in white.-_-&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done, though, but I really wanted the tan color as well to match my skin more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. . Very fast shipping.  I&#x27;m still using them! Their still full...doesn&#x27;t require to use so muc</li>
    <li> Prolongs eye shadow.  A must have.</li>
    <li> Amazing , the white base is a shimmery base didn&#x27;t expect that but it&#x27;s also good</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but these eyeshadow bases did NOT work for me -- they are VERY sticky on the eyelid and really &#x27;bothered&#x27; me all day long.  I am over 50, so maybe that&#x27;s part of my issue w/this product.  The color was not very opaque and did not do the job.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I can only say good things about this product it works wonderful it set up very nice, love it love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome and keeps my eye shadow on all day long with no oily lines or creases...woop woop!</li>
