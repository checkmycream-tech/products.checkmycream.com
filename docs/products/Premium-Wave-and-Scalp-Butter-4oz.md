      <li>no problem this one not so much.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>If not your hair will be very greasy.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually good for some people who want to keep there hair moisturised but as far as giving your hair hold after styling your hair with a brush or a comb it may not last as long as you would expect.</li>
      <li>It is an okay product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy  nor weighed down even though it has some hold.</li>
      <li>i would recommend the COLD LABEL WOLFIN POMADE that product will give your hair not only moisture and shine but also give you excellent hold just use as much as needed for your hair.  </li>
      <li>Works well on my 4 year old.  </li>
      <li>Keeps your hair soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>the next day i took my braids out and they were really wavy and defined.</li>
      <li>Also, we use this on our one year old daughters hair.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you only use a small amount.  </li>
      <li>because if you do one thing to your hair like if anything touches your hair like running your fingers through it or rubbing your head up against something like a wall or if it gets wet your hair is pissed off and you have to go through a process of getting it to look a certain way once again.</li>
      <li>I received feedback about my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; literally the very next day after applying overnight and duraging.&lt;br /&gt;Listen, don&#x27;t wait around, order this organic, all natural pomade and bring your waves to the next level.</li>

<li> When i first opened it and seen how thick it was</li>
<li> After several years in the dry Iraqi desert, his hair had become quite unmanageable.  </li>
<li> i put this is my hair and thoroughly detangled it with a wide tooth comb and then sectioned my hair and put my hair in 2 french braids.</li>
<li> you can also use this product for long hair too.</li>
<li> My husband has very dry hair, and this product has done wonders for his wave pattern.  </li>
<li> What a huge disappointment.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t hold... Not worth it.</li>
<li> It was too hard to brush through my hair and it left my waves looking a mess.</li>
<li> Not for laying hair down, you have to buy the wolfin pomade for that.</li>
<li> I typically use Sportin Waves and it holds my waves all day</li>
<li> has little to medium hold</li>
<li> Holy cow!!</li>
<li> A little weak at holding my hair down and keeping my waves set all day.</li>
<li> my hair is all the way past my collarbone or to the rim of my shoulder blades.</li>
<li> Those in the wave game KNOW that Cold Label Premium Wave and Scalp Butter is an absolute must!</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
<li> Both products are and I would recommend this product to serious wavers.</li>
<li> you can also layer this product with other juices from the COLD LABEL company that is optional.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t make the same stupid mistake I did.</li>
<li> No petroleum that will throw your wave game off.</li>
<li> , that&#x27;s my bad</li>
<li> After reading the reviews u was eager to try it and man was I disappointed..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A little weak at holding my hair down and keeping my waves set all day. I typically use Sportin Waves and it holds my waves all day no problem this one not so much. It does smell good, think it&#x27;s the beeswax... I&#x27;m still gonna try their Wolfin Pomade though.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold... Not worth it. Also, I was sent the wave pomade, not the wave and scalp butter as listed.</li>
    <li> Didnt notice anything.</li>
    <li> a great product for shine, and definition</li>
    <li> Not for laying hair down, you have to buy the wolfin pomade for that. Don&#x27;t make the same stupid mistake I did. Wolfin Pomade is to train and scalp butter is to maintain. Now I have to spend another $14 to get the right product, that&#x27;s my bad this is a great product, if you use it for the proper reason.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a top notch product that is in a league of its own.  Coldlabel just earned a customer for life.</li>
    <li> It is great for laying down your wave, I love it!</li>
    <li> Its like butter baby! Best Butter there is! Use all three products when wolfing to get the best results</li>
    <li> Great Product and great smell, the 360 Wolfin&#x27; Pomade I had before had great hold but the scalp butter on the other hand smells a lot pleasing. Both products are and I would recommend this product to serious wavers.</li>
    <li> Holy cow!! I just found min in the mailbox n it smells great n feels great as well, i even bought the wolfing pomade too... 5star</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I had found about it from WAVERS. It is an okay product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy  nor weighed down even though it has some hold. Smells good but too costly for long term usage.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 2 years no complaints  it does what is supposed to do for hair shine and nourishment for the scalp has little to medium hold but that is what the wolfing pomade is for.</li>
    <li> You can get better products than this for wolfing unless you just want some natural stuff.</li>
    <li> Those in the wave game KNOW that Cold Label Premium Wave and Scalp Butter is an absolute must! I had an immediate, noticeable change in my hair&#x27;s response to brushing, and hold. I received feedback about my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; literally the very next day after applying overnight and duraging.&lt;br /&gt;Listen, don&#x27;t wait around, order this organic, all natural pomade and bring your waves to the next level. No petroleum that will throw your wave game off.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, smooth as butter out of the can... the smell is just too strong for my liking.</li>
    <li> Smells great make my hair feel the same way thanks</li>
    <li> So far so good. Really like the light texture.</li>
    <li> Keeps your hair soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Also good to use to train your hair to get waves.</li>
    <li> Has a good smell. Doesn&#x27;t have a good hold. Feels like a healthy product for hair.  Light weight. Hasnt caused any irriation too skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually good for some people who want to keep there hair moisturised but as far as giving your hair hold after styling your hair with a brush or a comb it may not last as long as you would expect. i would recommend the COLD LABEL WOLFIN POMADE that product will give your hair not only moisture and shine but also give you excellent hold just use as much as needed for your hair.  i sleep with a du-rag at night and i work outside a lot. i alway wear a du-rag it maintains my hair when i sleep at night so that way my hair is not rubbing up against anything like my pillow for instance or  when i work outside doing yardwork like mowing the lawn for example. and don&#x27;t want grass and twigs and leaves getting in my hair. and if its too hot i will sweat the product out of my hair in matter of minutes and if its rains be sure that you wear a hat or a hood on your head to maintain your hair. because if you do one thing to your hair like if anything touches your hair like running your fingers through it or rubbing your head up against something like a wall or if it gets wet your hair is pissed off and you have to go through a process of getting it to look a certain way once again. so all you will do is cause frizz. also F.Y.I. i don&#x27;t have short hair my hair is all the way past my collarbone or to the rim of my shoulder blades. i put this is my hair and thoroughly detangled it with a wide tooth comb and then sectioned my hair and put my hair in 2 french braids. the next day i took my braids out and they were really wavy and defined. you can also layer this product with other juices from the COLD LABEL company that is optional. so not only is this product good for waves in fades or short hair cuts you can also use this product for long hair too. i do styles such as ponytails and braids ect.</li>
    <li> looks great soon as you apply it to your hair</li>
    <li> What a huge disappointment. After reading the reviews u was eager to try it and man was I disappointed.. It was too hard to brush through my hair and it left my waves looking a mess. Never again</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Arrived on time</li>
    <li> Makes my waves stand out from a distance and brings sheen to my hair!</li>
    <li> When i first opened it and seen how thick it was i thought it was gon go on like pomade which i dnt like. When i rubbed it in ma hands den head it went on smooth. I like using it as a moisturizer it doesn&#x27;t seem to enhance ma waves doe...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, my boyfriend can&#x27;t wait to start using.</li>
    <li> Oh yea smells good light does not build out like those chemically enhanced everyday pomades sold at the beauty stores adds shine softness and 100% natural meaning it&#x27;s edible thank you will be getting more</li>
    <li> Great product and it smells good also. Excellent service</li>
    <li> Love it great for waves 😎</li>
    <li> Goes on light, nice smell, good shine, good hold.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Gives perfect&lt;br /&gt;texture and perfect hold.  This product&lt;br /&gt;is a waver&#x27;s dream.</li>
    <li> Great product got to me real fast already noticing a difference</li>
    <li> Make sure that you only use a small amount.  If not your hair will be very greasy.</li>
    <li> Works well on my 4 year old.  More on the top but it does nothing for the back of his head.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks. Used in combination with a good conditioner it keeps your hair soft and malleable. I don&#x27;t like my hair to feel like it has product in it but this stuff allows me to brush it back and keep it relatively in place. It also keeps it moisturized and smelling nice. I&#x27;ll be re-upping as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. It keeps my hair and scalp moisturized and it smell great.</li>
    <li> it smells good but it&#x27;s not hyped up as its advertised. It&#x27;s not a premium product by any means and it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
    <li> Head feels after this application !</li>
    <li> My husband has very dry hair, and this product has done wonders for his wave pattern.  After several years in the dry Iraqi desert, his hair had become quite unmanageable.  It has a pleasant scent; does not smell like chemicals.  Also, we use this on our one year old daughters hair.</li>
    <li> My hubby love this stuff!</li>
