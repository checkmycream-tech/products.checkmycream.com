      <li>They look to be nice headbands.  </li>
      <li>Responded to my email very quickly and shipped all the colors I needed, couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
      <li>If you have a sport to do I would recommend wearing these cuz they stay in super nice!</li>
      <li>It just so happened that the one I wanted most already broke.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipment and great customer service and communication</li>
      <li>I love them.  </li>
      <li>Wife loves them and going to buy more</li>
      <li>I have ordered these headbands more than once because my daughter LOVES them.  </li>
      <li>They just need to be more durable.  </li>
      <li>Great price, fast shipping, but one already snapped apart.</li>
      <li>These are super cute!</li>
      <li>Enjoy :)</li>
      <li>They break really easy.</li>
      <li>and they are so easy to put on</li>
      <li>The glitter stays on well and the band is strong.</li>
      <li>Kenz Laurenz sent me my headbands quickly!  </li>
      <li>The head bands themselves aren&#x27;t as cheap looking as everyone else seems to be saying.</li>
      <li>The customer service was fantastic.</li>
      <li>A cheap price for a cheap product.</li>
      <li>Also they were noty comfortable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>I believe perhaps a different kind of glue could be used or more sturdier material should be considered in making these.</li>
      <li>They look a little folded when they first arrive but don&#x27;t be dismayed - as soon as they start wearing them they smooth out and look great!</li>
      <li>but she loves it so much that we ordered 6 more.  </li>
      <li>The sparkles do come off too, but not terribly bad.</li>
      <li>These headbands are cheap, so I can&#x27;t rate them too low because being honest you get what you pay for at $1/each.  </li>
      <li>Your very pretty</li>
      <li>THERE REALLY PRETTY!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t expect to wear these more than once, perhaps twice before they fall apart, but for the price they make ok girl&#x27;s party favors or single use costume headbands.</li>
      <li>They were very immediate on their response to me and I was provided with friendly conversation in response to my request.</li>
      <li>and it started coming apart right away.  </li>
      <li>love the different options&amp; that I got to pick the ones I wanted.</li>
      <li>Will be purchasing more of these in the future!</li>
      <li>I liked them at first, even though they didn&#x27;t have the head grip that the more expensive ones do.</li>
      <li>I would have better off buying the more expensive ones.</li>
      <li>They also included something special for my little diva ..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only worn three of them so far</li>
      <li>We initially ordered the hot pink one to go with a Halloween costume</li>

<li> But just be aware they are SUPER THIN!!!!</li>
<li> and I consider my head to be of average size.</li>
<li> - she just slips them all the way down over her head</li>
<li> These headbands are too small for the head.  </li>
<li> They were not cheaply made either!  </li>
<li> What really forced me to give this product a one star is that they BROKE.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s how thin these are!</li>
<li> I feel that they are very poorly made.</li>
<li> I was really disappointed.</li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
<li> Horrible, stiff,my daughter hates them.</li>

    <li> These headbands are cheap, so I can&#x27;t rate them too low because being honest you get what you pay for at $1/each.  The sparkly part of these headbands is an unfinished strip of white fabric with the glitter glued to it (unfinished means simply cut, so the edges fray). Some of the bands have white strings of the under layer peeling away and trimming them only helps a little.  They&#x27;re held together with glue, so don&#x27;t expect miracles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t expect to wear these more than once, perhaps twice before they fall apart, but for the price they make ok girl&#x27;s party favors or single use costume headbands.</li>
    <li> They are a Christmas gift so my kids haven&#x27;t worn them yet.  They look to be nice headbands.  Like the animal print options</li>
    <li> Kenz Laurenz sent me my headbands quickly!  Over-all I love them.  It just so happened that the one I wanted most already broke.  The rubbery part came out of the glitter part. I am bummed!</li>
    <li> The customer service was fantastic. They were very immediate on their response to me and I was provided with friendly conversation in response to my request. The head bands themselves aren&#x27;t as cheap looking as everyone else seems to be saying. The glitter stays on well and the band is strong.</li>
    <li> These headbands are too small for the head.  Only made for tiny heads not for some one that has a big head. They break really easy. I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wife loves them and going to buy more</li>
    <li> You can choose any style and color.  They were not cheaply made either!  my daughter loves them and wears them all the time.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, great quality comfortable and non slip! Responded to my email very quickly and shipped all the colors I needed, couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize they were paper.  Also they were noty comfortable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. A cheap price for a cheap product. I liked them at first, even though they didn&#x27;t have the head grip that the more expensive ones do. What really forced me to give this product a one star is that they BROKE. I&#x27;ve only worn three of them so far and I consider my head to be of average size. They snapped on like the third time wearing them for a non-extended period of time. So disappointed. I would have better off buying the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> These are super cute!</li>
    <li> Arrived just as described and my daughter loves them!  She wears them for dance and to school.  Keeps her hair in place and looks adorable!  Will be purchasing more of these in the future!</li>
    <li> I have ordered these headbands more than once because my daughter LOVES them.  They are glittery/sparkly in appearance but no glitter falls off and best of all, the elastic band that goes underneath makes them very comfortable and she doesn&#x27;t get a headache like she does with some of our other headbands.  My daughter is only 6 and they are so easy to put on - she just slips them all the way down over her head and then she just pulls them up and they look great!  Best of all she can put them on herself!!  We initially ordered the hot pink one to go with a Halloween costume but she loves it so much that we ordered 6 more.  They look a little folded when they first arrive but don&#x27;t be dismayed - as soon as they start wearing them they smooth out and look great!</li>
    <li> These headbands look great, but they break after a couple of uses.  They just need to be more durable.  Colors are nice and I did get to choose which I wanted.</li>
    <li> These headbands are VERY EXTREMLY thin like paper literally... They however are very cute and sparkly on! But just be aware they are SUPER THIN!!!! The sparkles do come off too, but not terribly bad. My daughter pulled on one of hers and it crumbled in her hand! Had to throw it away, could not be straightened out... That&#x27;s how thin these are!</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, but one already snapped apart.</li>
    <li> love the different options&amp; that I got to pick the ones I wanted.</li>
    <li> Very nice headbands....kids loved them.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter and she wore one of them twice and it started coming apart right away.  I feel that they are very poorly made. I believe perhaps a different kind of glue could be used or more sturdier material should be considered in making these.</li>
    <li> THERE REALLY PRETTY! If you have a sport to do I would recommend wearing these cuz they stay in super nice! Your very pretty and you get 6. It&#x27;s worth the price! Enjoy :)</li>
    <li> Horrible, stiff,my daughter hates them. Feels like paper.</li>
    <li> Loved loved these ... My daughter is so happy as am I. They also included something special for my little diva .. Fast shipment and great customer service and communication .. I will definitely order and recommend to anyone ! Thank you guys again!</li>
