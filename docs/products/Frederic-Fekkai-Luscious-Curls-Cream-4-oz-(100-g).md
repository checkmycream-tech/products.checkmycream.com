<li> It leaves your hair feeling soft and not &#x27;crunchy&#x27; like other styling products.</li>
<li> defines my long Italian curly hair-</li>
<li> I briefly towel dry, then finger comb and set my hair style.</li>
<li> Again, a little goes a long way and if you use too much it can make the strands of hair wet</li>
<li> I have naturally curly, blonde shoulder length hair, and use this product to tame my unruly curls.</li>
<li> My daughter has long hair and uses this quite often.</li>
<li> I have long wavy hair and didn&#x27;t see any difference after using this product.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think this would be enough product to use by itself on my wet hair</li>
<li> Also, it can be applied in the hair wet or dry for an instant curl boost.</li>
<li> My hair is waist-length with naturally loose spiral curls, but because they&#x27;re so loose and long</li>
<li> This product really helps but is a little pricey :-/</li>
<li> I applied the Fekkai Luscious Curls Cream to my wet hair this morning and then allowed it to air dry.</li>
<li> I have very thick, very wavy hair...    </li>
<li> This cream creates soft curls that aren&#x27;t hard and crunchy.  </li>
<li> I like the product though it doesn&#x27;t provide the shine i expected.</li>
<li> It may seem a little pricey but a little of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
<li> My thick, waist-length hair only needs a nickle-sized blob rubbed all over my palms and fingers.</li>
<li> /&gt;I will warn, however, that you can only use a VERY small amount before it gets crunchy.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not at all oily and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky or heavy.</li>
<li> Even if I put a small amount in my hair, it makes it looks weighed down and greasy.</li>
<li> It helps tame and give shape to my curly hair on humid days.  </li>
<li> Take a little bit of the lotion into your hands and run your fingers through your hair to spread it, then scrunch your hair up a bit and poof it out some--incredible results!  </li>
<li> Sorry , I find it different than the one I was using for almost 10 years, it doesn&#x27;t work like it</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it did not work.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years but found it hard to find</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t put it on too thick, though.  </li>
<li> Very hard to find.</li>
<li> think as well it is too expensive</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so sad John Frieda discontinued</li>
<li> , I was wrong.</li>
<li> Plus it was so expensive</li>
<li> I&#x27;m now addicted!</li>
<li> How frustrating!</li>
<li> I use it every time I wash - totally addicted!</li>
<li> It is not perfect, but I would buy it again.  </li>

    <li> When ever I use it I feel like I need to wash my hair, it become very sticky.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work as well as the creme I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it did not work.  It smells lovely, but that&#x27;s about the only positive I can muster for it.  I have very thick, very wavy hair...    Better luck next time!</li>
    <li> I have long wavy hair and didn&#x27;t see any difference after using this product.  I recommend their glossing spray and a blow dryer instead.  This won&#x27;t do much for you.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, wavy, curls.  This product puts them as they should be... nice, soft curls.  No way to tell you have used a thing.  I have tried a billion curl products.  This is the best!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is not perfect, but I would buy it again.  It was recommended by a friend and I really like it. The smell is nice, kind of sweet with a hint of grapefruit. I don&#x27;t like grapefruit or it&#x27;s smell, but I like the smell of this cream.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It would get 5 stars if the price wasn&#x27;t so high!</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend this product for curly hair. It makes the hair look and smell amazing!  I use it every time I wash - totally addicted!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I have naturally curly hair and this product really keeps it from being frizzy - it is fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using it for years but found it hard to find - Nordstrom and Saphora stopped carrying it and luckily, thanks again to AMAZON, I was able to find it, so now my hair and I are VERY happy!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU AMAZON :)  (I always check Amazon before buying anything - great customer service - so easy, returns so uncomplicated, greatest shopping experience. I tell all my friends that I ONLY buy from Amazon, no matter what the product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair - this weighs it down and makes it sticky</li>
    <li> This cream creates soft curls that aren&#x27;t hard and crunchy.  But the flip side is that your hair feels a bit greasy, so I think I&#x27;ll stick with a gel formula.</li>
    <li> This poduct was recommended to me by multiple friends for my wavy, frizzy hair. To be honest, I saw no difference with this product than using a $5 product from Target. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> How frustrating! I spent a good amount of money on this only to see absolutely no results. I have type 3A curls, and the product I have kept coming back to for years is Catwalk Curls Rock by TIGI, but I am always on the lookout for a better product. I applied the Fekkai Luscious Curls Cream to my wet hair this morning and then allowed it to air dry. Now several hours later my curls are barely defined and very frizzy. One more product to cross off the list in my search for perfect curls!</li>
    <li> Love this curl product. My hair curls perfectly and does not look greasy. Will continue to use in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the best curl cream - not too heavy, but makes my natural curls look glossy and frizzless. It&#x27;s not at all oily and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky or heavy. It also smells wonderful! I like using it on my hair when dry to make my curls look nice and fresh again.

I use this as a glosser, de-frizzer, and freshener and for that, I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I absolutely love it and recommend for anyone who has curly hair. It leaves your hair feeling soft and not &#x27;crunchy&#x27; like other styling products. It may seem a little pricey but a little of this stuff goes a long way. Don&#x27;t over use and it will last. Well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful, first off. Also, it can be applied in the hair wet or dry for an instant curl boost. It really brings the life back to my wavy hair after a blow dry.</li>
    <li> Awful. Awful. Awful. I thought this was going to be a great product for my curls after reading the product description. Plus it was so expensive, I was like, how can it not be good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was wrong. Even if I put a small amount in my hair, it makes it looks weighed down and greasy. It does nothing to define the curls and make them bouncy and add volume. And to top it all off, it actually makes my hair look frizzy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so sad John Frieda discontinued Frizz Ease Weather Works Style Sealant Creme. Anyone know of anything comparable?</li>
    <li> My wife says its very good. She will continue to by this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Starlit Waves spray until they discontinued it. I&#x27;d also been using the Fekkai Luscious Curls shampoo and conditioner for a while and loving them, so I started using this cream. It works SO WELL. My hair is waist-length with naturally loose spiral curls, but because they&#x27;re so loose and long they tend to droop by the end of the day. The cream keeps them tight-ish without looking like screws coming out of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn, however, that you can only use a VERY small amount before it gets crunchy. My thick, waist-length hair only needs a nickle-sized blob rubbed all over my palms and fingers. Any more and my hair gets hard.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as hyped-really great for curly hair, not sticky, not stiff just holds curls naturally.  I&#x27;m now addicted!</li>
    <li> Cheaper then the retail stores. My daughter has long hair and uses this quite often. She loves it. I tried it but it didn&#x27;t give me the exact result. Different hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product, when used in combination with a diffuser it works way better. Nice to be able to wear my hair with out having to flat iron or use the curling iron. Smell is not overwelming. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It helps tame and give shape to my curly hair on humid days.  Has good holding power and does not make hair &amp;#34; crunchy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Sorry , I find it different than the one I was using for almost 10 years, it doesn&#x27;t work like it should.&lt;br /&gt;I think as well it is too expensive , I use to pay 79$.</li>
    <li> This product really works great. For anyone with curly hair they know the daily struggle it could be trying to maintain your curls. This product really helps but is a little pricey :-/</li>
    <li> The product arrived within the time frame specified.  I like the product though it doesn&#x27;t provide the shine i expected.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and wanted.</li>
    <li> I like this. It holds the curls all day. I use it when I am in a hurry and my hair is damp. I like it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, although I think Fekai is discontinuing this and launching a different curls cream.&lt;br /&gt;This defines my long Italian curly hair- it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy and it smells amazing (kind of grapefruity, I think)</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, blonde shoulder length hair, and use this product to tame my unruly curls. I use it in the shower before my last rinse. As recommended I leave some in my hair and apply a little more after I get out of the shower. I briefly towel dry, then finger comb and set my hair style. I spray my hair with a lacquer spray, fluff it some more and then let it dry naturally. The curls are indeed beautiful and my hair looks great even after I sleep on it... I just fluff it in the morning with a little more spray.</li>
    <li> I was out shopping one day and tried some of this on at the store.  It was a dry windy day and my hair was all frizzed out and this stuff worked absolute wonders on it.  Not only did it enhance the (natural) curl of my hair, but it made it look artfully wild rather than just wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a bit spendy, but a little goes a long way and the first one I bought lasted me almost a year.  Take it with you on trips and you can ruffle some into your hair and quickly revive it.  Take a little bit of the lotion into your hands and run your fingers through your hair to spread it, then scrunch your hair up a bit and poof it out some--incredible results!  Don&#x27;t put it on too thick, though.  Again, a little goes a long way and if you use too much it can make the strands of hair wet-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, especially for those with wavy-curly wind makes it fly away hair.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very hard to find.</li>
