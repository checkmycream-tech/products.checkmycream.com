      <li>but this was one of those things I didn&#x27;t really expect to find, let alone at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this 99 percent solution.</li>
      <li>The top is sealed with foil to prevent accidental spillage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s alcohol, what more can you say about it?</li>
      <li>I make the fragrance fuels for me and my daughters and they love it too</li>
      <li>Love the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08/26/2014: was just informed that 70% alcohol is more effective at killing germs because it does not evaporate as quickly.</li>
      <li>Great price super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>As a bonus, stuff like sugar will not dissolve in pure alcohol, but if you use 70% alcohol, the 30% that is water will dissolve sugar, making it a more effective cleaner.     </li>
      <li>Isopropyl alcohol contains about 1% water which means it evaporates very quickly.</li>
      <li>Works great for cleaning off thermal paste (actually noticeably better than 70% if you ask me).</li>
      <li>This stuff is strong.</li>

      <li>This definitely saved the trip and I&#x27;m happy I bought it.</li>
      <li>will do great but bottles are tiny for the price!</li>
      <li>Just keep in mind, you will need to use this quickly once out of the bottle because it dries very quickly.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t readily find this concentration in my local stores so this was a great find and a better deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so you might be better off hunting around first.</li>
      <li>I bought this to clean my desk, phone, keyboard, and mouse at work.</li>
      <li>I bought this so I could clean my bearings without worrying about having them rust.</li>
      <li>I use this on cotton swabs and in a spray bottle to clean electronic components,  circuit boards, motherboards etc.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>No other alcohol brand protect my skin from germs and viruses aside from this very affordable and amazing alcohol!</li>
      <li>Kill the germs and then go away quickly so the germs don&#x27;t have a chance to build up a resistence to it.</li>
      <li>The liquid quickly evaporates and does not leave a film.</li>
      <li>so I had to get it quick.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low flash point and fast rate of evaporation and drying is what also makes this a great economical electronics cleaner.</li>
      <li>I am a Diebetic and a germaphobe need everything sterilized and that cheap 50 percent solution is mostly water the same for the 70 percent.</li>
      <li>Other than that, everything else is good.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s actual % rating, it seems to be authentic and works better than the normal 70% solution.</li>
      <li>stuff works great, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay $5+ a bottle for it.</li>
      <li>The cost might be because it is 99% alcohol and is highly flammable and would need special shipping and handling.</li>
      <li>Great quality Isopropyl Alcohol solution, even if the price was a little high.</li>
      <li>Put one in the Medicine Cabinet, another in First Aid Kit, and have a spare.  </li>
      <li>exactly it 99% Isopropyl Alcohol</li>
      <li>You can find a better price at your local pharmacy!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping...arrived as described!</li>
      <li>exactly as described, and sometimes I order stock stuff</li>
      <li>This high strength alcohol evaporates too quickly to allow it to kill micro-organisms correctly.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I wonder if this is even more pure than advertised when I pour this on my open wounds.</li>
      <li>So I got myself ready for the problem.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Not too much to say about alcohol.</li>
      <li>The foil lid under the cap is a pain to get off, but that doesn&#x27;t really diminish the product quality.</li>
      <li>others will tell you if you&#x27;re buying this mainly for sanitizing purposes</li>
      <li>It is the one to use when a mild solvent is required in a formula, such as liquid or paste solder flux.  </li>
      <li>This does have a strong smell but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
      <li>99% can be harder to find in local stores, but if you do find it I&#x27;m sure it will likely be more affordable for you locally.</li>
      <li>I live in a two hundred unit apartment building where bedbugs were found.  </li>
      <li>I read that Alcohol over seventy three percent would kill bedbugs when sprayed directly on them.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to check my local stores and edit this comment if 2-16oz bottles for $13.84 is actually reasonable.</li>
      <li>Short version of the explanation: 1) 99% evaporates too fast to sterilize 2)</li>
      <li>It works well with the Bones Bearings Cleaning Unit and none of my bearings have rusted so far.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised by the low price</li>
      <li>I use 99% alcohol to clean anything hard plastic or metallic with adhesive or oil residue.</li>
      <li>This stuff evaporates nearly immediately which means I don&#x27;t have to wait around for parts to dry before moving on with my job.&lt;br</li>

    <li> Received the product today. The bottles were round with a red label, but same product obviously. I&#x27;m happy with the shipping, the product and the seller. Great experience all around.</li>
    <li> This stuff is strong. Remember to ventilate the area you&#x27;re working in.</li>
    <li> 99% Isopropyl Alcohol.  It is the one to use when a mild solvent is required in a formula, such as liquid or paste solder flux.  Google the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and of course, use it often in THE NEVER ENDING WAR ON EVIL GERMSES!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AU&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;//(~_~)\\</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t readily find this concentration in my local stores so this was a great find and a better deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought lots of stuff on Amazon but this was one of those things I didn&#x27;t really expect to find, let alone at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;I got lucky though and the price seems to fluctuate greatly here so you might be better off hunting around first.</li>
    <li> timely arrival, as advertised, good product.</li>
    <li> An alcohol product that cleanses deeply and efficiently. Kills germs and bacteria without leaving harsh marks on your body.</li>
    <li> I was waiting forever for the package to come. Other than that, everything else is good.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, and sometimes I order stock stuff I know is at the local store just to save myself a trip. This definitely saved the trip and I&#x27;m happy I bought it. Quality is great, just the same as all 99% alcohols!</li>
    <li> Came quickly and cleans wonderfully.  Great for disinfecting. Evaporates quickly which is great cleaning electronics.</li>
    <li> Expensive... but I bought it.</li>
    <li> Just what it says it is</li>
    <li> Isopropyl has so many uses - and this is a good one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s isopropyl alcohol. Can&#x27;t really mess that up.</li>
    <li> A superior product at a bargain price!  I was very surprised by the low price so I awaited a product that in some way would reflect it. I was wrong to be concerned.  This was a wonderful transaction.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t force me to write something when I don&#x27;t want to write something!!!</li>
    <li> No other alcohol brand protect my skin from germs and viruses aside from this very affordable and amazing alcohol! bought three bottles for future use!</li>
    <li> A Household staple it should be kept in everyone&#x27;s home for a variety of uses it&#x27;s good to have around, just don&#x27;t drink it.</li>
    <li> With no way of myself testing it&#x27;s actual % rating, it seems to be authentic and works better than the normal 70% solution. A good buy!</li>
    <li> This product is 99% alcohol which is tough to find in my area. I trust the quality of the product. The top is sealed with foil to prevent accidental spillage. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I wonder if this is even more pure than advertised when I pour this on my open wounds. It&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, that&#x27;ll get ya out of bed!</li>
    <li> I use this product to clean cuts and scrapes that we have and it works wonderfully</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean my desk, phone, keyboard, and mouse at work. I expected the alcohol to dissapate - that is why I bought alcohol - but this stuff dissapates almost immediately! This means it works as expected. Kill the germs and then go away quickly so the germs don&#x27;t have a chance to build up a resistence to it. The problem with other disinfectants, like Lysol, is they stay on the surface too long so bacteria and virus&#x27; build up a resistence to it. Just keep in mind, you will need to use this quickly once out of the bottle because it dries very quickly. Love the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08/26/2014: was just informed that 70% alcohol is more effective at killing germs because it does not evaporate as quickly. I will dilute my product with sterilized or distilled water then! Still an effective product.</li>
    <li> Great quality Isopropyl Alcohol solution, even if the price was a little high.</li>
    <li> I use 99% alcohol to clean anything hard plastic or metallic with adhesive or oil residue. Cuts away grease with zero effort. Don&#x27;t use it on cuts unless you can stand the burning (70% or 91% is good for that).</li>
    <li> Great product. I could not find the 99% alcohol locally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for 99% alcohol and this stuff works great.</li>
    <li> Purchased strictly for reloading as used if the mixture for case lube.  Great price and product.</li>
    <li> Yep, it&#x27;s 99% isopropyl alcohol.</li>
    <li> Excellent fir making fragrance fuel for ceramic wick fragrance burners.. I make the fragrance fuels for me and my daughters and they love it too</li>
    <li> Germaphobes (which I am as well) - FYI, 70% is actually more effective than 99% against germs. -source: I&#x27;m a scientist and I use 70% in the lab. Short version of the explanation: 1) 99% evaporates too fast to sterilize 2) proteins (in this case germ protein) will denature more efficiently in alcohol with a bit of water (~70% has been tested as most effective). As a bonus, stuff like sugar will not dissolve in pure alcohol, but if you use 70% alcohol, the 30% that is water will dissolve sugar, making it a more effective cleaner.     As for this product review, it seems overpriced. I&#x27;m going to check my local stores and edit this comment if 2-16oz bottles for $13.84 is actually reasonable. The cost might be because it is 99% alcohol and is highly flammable and would need special shipping and handling.</li>
    <li> made scented oils with this and they worked perfect</li>
    <li> I love this 99 percent solution. I also like the 91 percent solution. I am a Diebetic and a germaphobe need everything sterilized and that cheap 50 percent solution is mostly water the same for the 70 percent.</li>
    <li> exactly it 99% Isopropyl Alcohol</li>
    <li> Great for QWISO hash. Speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could clean my bearings without worrying about having them rust. It works well with the Bones Bearings Cleaning Unit and none of my bearings have rusted so far.</li>
    <li> waaaaaaaaaaay to expensive. I was under the gun so I had to get it quick.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for soap making .. To prevent soda ash on handmade soaps..&lt;br /&gt;So I am quite pleased with it!</li>
    <li> will do great but bottles are tiny for the price! You can find a better price at your local pharmacy!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping...arrived as described!</li>
    <li> Nintey-Nine percent Isopropyl alcohol contains about 1% water which means it evaporates very quickly. This is the ideal situation for cleaning when you need quick evaporation and no moisture hanging around. I use the 99% alcohol for cleaning items prior to painting. The alcohol removes dirt, oil, silicone, grease and all sorts of other things that can ruin paint finish and adhesion. This stuff evaporates nearly immediately which means I don&#x27;t have to wait around for parts to dry before moving on with my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low flash point and fast rate of evaporation and drying is what also makes this a great economical electronics cleaner. I use this on cotton swabs and in a spray bottle to clean electronic components,  circuit boards, motherboards etc. It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this in a pinch when I need to dry items or displace moisture. I&#x27;ve used this to dry out phones, electronic devices and even automotive A/C lines and components that need to be cleaned and have moisture removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others will tell you if you&#x27;re buying this mainly for sanitizing purposes you&#x27;ll want to buy a something in the 70% to 80% range for maximum effectiveness.  This high strength alcohol evaporates too quickly to allow it to kill micro-organisms correctly. Sounds weird but it&#x27;s true. Around 70% is the optimal strength for sanitizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay $5+ a bottle for it. 99% can be harder to find in local stores, but if you do find it I&#x27;m sure it will likely be more affordable for you locally.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alcohol, what more can you say about it?</li>
    <li> I liked it. I&#x27;m skeptical on the percentage, but I am not opposed to buying it again</li>
    <li> As a disinfectant, a 70% alcohol concentration works just as well as 99%. The difference between the two is the water content. The latter contains 1% water. As a result, it evaporates faster. This makes it an excellent cleaner for electrical circuit boards and connections. Using Q-Tips, the stuff dissolves grime, dust, and grease. The liquid quickly evaporates and does not leave a film. As a result, it does not cause short circuit problems when the equipment is turned ON, and electricity is activated.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s isopropyl. If you are buying iso, you know what to do with it. It cleans things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great, the shipping was fantastic, packed well, and it does as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What, did you want explosions and women wearing the hottest isopropyl fashion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it already!</li>
    <li> It appears to be 99% from the rate at which it evaporates, and it did come in two 16OZ bottles. Works great for cleaning off thermal paste (actually noticeably better than 70% if you ask me). The foil lid under the cap is a pain to get off, but that doesn&#x27;t really diminish the product quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected. Not too much to say about alcohol. It is what it is.</li>
    <li> Great price super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> just what i needed for my home emergency kit...</li>
    <li> Best of the best! I personally use this to sterilize makeup. This does have a strong smell but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> I live in a two hundred unit apartment building where bedbugs were found.  So I got myself ready for the problem.  Just in case.  I read that Alcohol over seventy three percent would kill bedbugs when sprayed directly on them.  I hope I don&#x27;t have to discover if it works.  Management has been using a heat treatment for units with problems and I hope they get the problem solved.</li>
    <li> Used in combination with other household cleaners during some deep spring cleaning. It worked for my purpose greatly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> great  I would recommend this</li>
    <li> Value you pack and who doesn&#x27;t need Alcoholic Antiseptic around their house.  Put one in the Medicine Cabinet, another in First Aid Kit, and have a spare.  What store can beat the value price of smile.amazon.com?</li>
    <li> Great and fast delivery.Thanks</li>
    <li> If you have a bong or a glass pipe and keep trying to remind yourself to get some rubbing alcohol, this is the solution. I was using Vodka and man does that get expensive, plus it doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
