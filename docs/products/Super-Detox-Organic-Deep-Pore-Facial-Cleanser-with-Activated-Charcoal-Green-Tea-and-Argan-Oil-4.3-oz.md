### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>In fact, it&#x27;s one of the best smelling cleansers I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
      <li>What I found that works best is that you have to keep rubbing your skin with your fingertips</li>

      <li>It smells great and is made with great ingredients, but I&#x27;ve developed cystic acne since using this product.</li>
      <li>cleanser does a good job of cleaning and has no harmful/harsh chemicals, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the totally clean, exfoliated yet &#x27;just-right&#x27; feeling that my Dr. Alkatis cleanser does.&lt;br</li>
      <li>lol  the first couple of times i used it</li>
      <li>this stuff is ok.</li>

      <li>If your face is oily, it might not be the best thing for you, and it doesn&#x27;t remove oil as well as some other products.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic once a week or once a month detox cleanser.</li>
      <li>I have not found anything as gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>B004V0SZNO BriteLeafs 4-in-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System (BL-802)]], a great alternative to the Clarasonic.</li>
      <li>I have used a product similar that caused nothing but problems but this product works great.</li>
      <li>best way to use this product is to use very little water on your face to start.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited about this product I washed my face immediately after I got it out my mailbox, even though I had just finished washing my face 5 minutes before.</li>
      <li>well worth it!</li>
      <li>Great for older normal to oily skin.</li>
      <li>I do not feel it gets anything clean</li>
      <li>This product is nothing special for the money .I</li>
      <li>I love this gentle cleanser.</li>
      <li>It is super runny and I did not notice any change.</li>
      <li>It does not lather, but spreads fairly evenly over the face, without needing a lot of product; a lot goes a long way.</li>
      <li>this would be a great product if it was not watered down.</li>
      <li>From the first time I used this product I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin!</li>
      <li>I have super oily skin and very large pores.</li>
      <li>but I like my old wash better</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with how clear and even my complexion is despite the raging hormones of pregnancy.</li>
      <li>love this face wash, improves the skin so much and gentle to use</li>
      <li>I do feel like it really gets my skin super clean.  </li>
      <li>However, your skin will feel soft, and clean!</li>
      <li>I love the citrusy essential oils.</li>
      <li>Gently remove SD with a warm towel and if your skin feels dry after using SD try applying (patting)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s control her ace and Pore and leave her skin soft and clean.</li>
      <li>skin and Super Detox leaves my skin feeling fresh but not dry.</li>
      <li>This stuff has improved my skin, smells incredible and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance and seems to diminishing black heads as advertised.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and susceptible to breakouts and have large pores.  </li>
      <li>I really liked the way this smelled - very floral with a slight hint of orange.  </li>
      <li>I have been a fan of Angel Face&#x27;s Kissed cleanser for some time, but when I became pregnant my normally calm skin totally freaked out</li>
      <li>This is a very very high quality product.</li>
      <li>My pores appear smaller as they are clean for the first time ever.</li>
      <li>However, I didn&#x27;t really notice any visible difference after using it.  </li>
      <li>when I looked at my cheeks they were so much lighter</li>
      <li>and I have to use so much at one time.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>did not suds and is very costly.&lt;br /&gt;charcoal</li>
      <li>Cleans real well and like the fragrance.</li>
      <li>I really like this one.  </li>
      <li>cannot believe the materials to make this product shot up that much in price.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin (with oily T-zone area) and live in a hot, humid climate.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Conclusion: I will reserve it for the days when my skin is really dehydrated and I only require a mild cleansing.</li>
      <li>Having said that, if money is no object, this is a nice cleanser, but there are others that do the job just as well and are also all natural that cost half the price.</li>
      <li>thought I would give this product a try ,simply because it sounded  cool ,since it had activated charcoal  in it.</li>
      <li>Although it is not a bad wash, I would not consider this a daily wash.</li>
      <li>Overall, not a bad product but too pricey for what it does not deliver.</li>
      <li>That said, I can add organic, activated charcoal to my favorite cleanser for much less price.</li>
      <li>But again, this cleanser will most likely only last a couple weeks, which I don&#x27;t think is really worth the $24 pricetag.</li>
      <li>The natural ingredients make it feel very high-end.</li>
      <li>While it is very thin and will NOT foam, it can and will do a great job of getting the stuff out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered another bottle a week and a half ago and my face just cleared up and now when I touch my cheeks theyare smooth.</li>
      <li>By the end of the week my skin was really clear.</li>
      <li>It has kept my skin clear of breakouts.</li>
      <li>but this is a natural product, not a chemical compound that will give you the foam</li>
      <li>Clears out the clogged pores and does it with natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I tried this cleanser and saw near immediate results.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft and supple, and well balanced.</li>
      <li>This completely fits the bill.</li>
      <li>So far I have been using this cleanser for 4 months now.</li>
      <li>I appreciate that it contains mostly natural and organic ingredients.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this stuff is ok. like the organic ingredients but dunno if it is worth $26 for this little bottle. Granted, you don&#x27;t need a lot to scrub your face. It does like to run out of your hand on the way to your face. lol  the first couple of times i used it, i had new acne the next day. But I think the key is to rinse thoroughly...</li>
    <li> This is a lovely cleanser. Light and slightly runny, not highly foaming. I have normal to dry skin and Super Detox leaves my skin feeling fresh but not dry. I love the citrusy essential oils. The natural ingredients make it feel very high-end. Don&#x27;t let the simple packaging fool you.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have super oily skin and very large pores. I have used countless other products (proactiv, clean and clear, neutrogena, ect) and they have been helpful. But I have always wanted to find something equally helpful that was not as chemically harsh. This completely fits the bill. My skin feels totally clean but not dried out after I wash and it stays feeling that way for at least as long as the other chemical based products if not longer. AFB has definitely won me over and I have already purchased more of their products. One warning. As others have mentioned it DOES NOT lather. If that is of importance then they have another cleanser that does. I haven&#x27;t used it so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness. But if lather isn&#x27;t a must you will probably love this cleanser!</li>
    <li> From the first time I used this product I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin! Super Detox cleans so deeply removing all the urban grime trapped in my enlarged pores, leaving my face as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom! I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I was a bit surprised at how small the bottle was, especially for $24, but I guess the description did say 4.3 oz, so I should have paid more attention. I received the cleanser today, immediately washed my face and here&#x27;s what I found: It has a pleasant fragrance, a bit minty. It does not lather, but spreads fairly evenly over the face, without needing a lot of product; a lot goes a long way. My face feels very clean, and does not feel as though any residue was left behind. But again, this cleanser will most likely only last a couple weeks, which I don&#x27;t think is really worth the $24 pricetag. I would have rated this product 5 stars if there was more product or was less expensive.</li>
    <li> I never heard of charcoal removing toxins from your body, so I was surprised to come across this product while researching natural facial washes. Upon reading some of the reviews I took it upon myself to do some reading on charcoal and its properties. I felt what I read along with some of the reviews convinced me enough to make a purchase. I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was skeptical but the way my cheeks have been riddled with blackheads I figured I had nothing to lose. I was so excited about this product I washed my face immediately after I got it out my mailbox, even though I had just finished washing my face 5 minutes before. Like all the other reviewers said, this product DOES not foam up, instead it is a thin liquid that smells like roasted minty lemongrass. Mmmm! I left it on my face after massaging it in thoroughly for 5 minutes, when I looked at my cheeks they were so much lighter which indicated the product worked with removing the blackheads. However, it did not remove all of them, which are the ones that are embedded deep in my face(ewwww). After using it 2 more times, I could feel the embedded ones coming to the surface, and now since I&#x27;ve had it for a week, my cheeks are almost bump free, yayyyy! It is a great product for ladies who wear make-up, it can help with removing all that stuff from your pores. I recommend using it with [[ASIN:B004V0SZNO BriteLeafs 4-in-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System (BL-802)]], a great alternative to the Clarasonic. This is def going in with my skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4-29-13: I did stop using this product bc of the price however when I seen that they had increased the bottle size I purchased another one. I hated that I stopped using this product bc my pores get so clogged I am constantly breaking out. My face was so congested I could feel little bumps beneath my skin and nothing was working. I ordered another bottle a week and a half ago and my face just cleared up and now when I touch my cheeks theyare smooth. To increase this product effectiveness take a rag wet it with hot water and put it to your face for about 3 times for about 10 seconds each. Then use a facial scrub brush to get in your pores and let it sit for about 2 minutes, this helps also with milia under your eyes, just gently rub those areas with the facial wash and in no time those will disappear too. No I do not work for the company, just offering advice to other oily faced people.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Angel Face&#x27;s Kissed cleanser for some time, but when I became pregnant my normally calm skin totally freaked out and I needed serious help. I tried this cleanser and saw near immediate results. I am so pleased with how clear and even my complexion is despite the raging hormones of pregnancy. The cleanser is super light and has an awesome citrus smell. Thank you Angel Face!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a bad product, in fact it is quite nice. However my skin did not feel any different or cleaner than it does after I use my usual organic cleansers that costs half the price. I found it quite curious that the 4  5 Star reviews are written by people that only reviewed products by this company, seems a little fishy to me. Having said that, if money is no object, this is a nice cleanser, but there are others that do the job just as well and are also all natural that cost half the price.</li>
    <li> love this face wash, improves the skin so much and gentle to use</li>
    <li> I have used a product similar that caused nothing but problems but this product works great. Super cleans my face and rids me of any bad stuff forming. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, I&#x27;m not really impressed at all. It smells great and is made with great ingredients, but I&#x27;ve developed cystic acne since using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this gentle cleanser. I have mostly oily skin, and use a glycolic cleanser once a week to control breakouts. But the glycolic is too strong to use everyday, so I use the Detox cleanser daily. I feel the Detox Cleanser really cleans my skin, but isn&#x27;t harsh at all. My skin is soft and supple, and well balanced. I love the silky texture.</li>
    <li> Was not worth the money as it didn&#x27;t do much and is very runny for a cleanser.  Not a fan</li>
    <li> Good product. Detoxes as said. That said, I can add organic, activated charcoal to my favorite cleanser for much less price.</li>
    <li> So far I have been using this cleanser for 4 months now. It has kept my skin clear of breakouts. It actually has stayed clear for the 4 months that I have been using it. I definetly recommend to everyone to at least try once.</li>
    <li> I love this product. So great for my skin. Pleasant smelling and effective.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping it would do something about my blackheads and pore size. Nope. It is super runny and I did not notice any change. Wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> I love it! Great for older normal to oily skin. It cleans, but does not strip, and it&#x27;s all natural. Smells great and gives me a mood lift. I use this product with an exfoliating cloth. Will buy again...I am almost out. Recommended for winter and dryer climates, and warmer humid climates with the help of an exfoliating cloth and toner.</li>
    <li> It used to be 11.00 for 8 oz., not 22.99 for 4.85 oz...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe the materials to make this product shot up that much in price.</li>
    <li> I really like this one.  I do feel like it really gets my skin super clean.  Clears out the clogged pores and does it with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  It truly works.  By the end of the week my skin was really clear.</li>
    <li> This product is nothing special for the money .I thought I would give this product a try ,simply because it sounded  cool ,since it had activated charcoal  in it.I have nice skin in the beginning but I do have a little break outs here and there do to my pregnancy.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any results and what is it suppose  to do again? Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Nothing amazing&lt;br /&gt;Cleans my skin, no irritation&lt;br /&gt;I am not into this stuff, was just trying it. Little bit of it cleans my entire face.</li>
    <li> Im half way through my first bottle and have stumbled upon a product I&#x27;ll never be without. I&#x27;ve never been one to try a lot of products, just used purpose liquid face soap for the last 20 years. This stuff has improved my skin, smells incredible and a little goes a long way. My pores appear smaller as they are clean for the first time ever. Love it.</li>
    <li> MMMM..this would be a great product if it was not watered down. It is a very thin consistency which I assume is done to save money but really...its water thin and just drips off my face. I do not feel it gets anything clean and I have to use so much at one time. Overpriced and not a good product in general. I would stick with Origins brand before buying this if I was you!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the feel of this, unfortunately it broke my face out. I was so&lt;br /&gt;disappointed, used it about 2 months, when I stopped my face cleared up. Will&lt;br /&gt;give it to someone since I think it was just me. I&#x27;m 59 and usually don&#x27;t get breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the fact that it does not contain a ton of chemicals.  I got tired for putting this acid or that acid or alcohol on my face and wanted to find something that would work well but not overwork my skin.  I have oily skin and susceptible to breakouts and have large pores.  I was reading articles and searching for many products and found this.  While it is very thin and will NOT foam, it can and will do a great job of getting the stuff out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to use this product is to use very little water on your face to start.  In the morning I pat my skin with a little bit of water and apply a dime size amount to my palm and apply to my face.  What I found that works best is that you have to keep rubbing your skin with your fingertips, this works the product in the skin to pull the grim out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some hate it for the watery consistency but this is a natural product, not a chemical compound that will give you the foam feel you are used to.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic once a week or once a month detox cleanser. I have not found anything as gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin (with oily T-zone area) and live in a hot, humid climate. I like my pores to be deeply cleansed but not to the extent that my skin gets dry and tight after a wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser does a good job of cleaning and has no harmful/harsh chemicals, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the totally clean, exfoliated yet &#x27;just-right&#x27; feeling that my Dr. Alkatis cleanser does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s too watery or because it has essential oils or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, the bottle is also a tad small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I will reserve it for the days when my skin is really dehydrated and I only require a mild cleansing.</li>
    <li> Cleans real well and like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I really liked the way this smelled - very floral with a slight hint of orange.  In fact, it&#x27;s one of the best smelling cleansers I&#x27;ve bought.  However, I didn&#x27;t really notice any visible difference after using it.  (A few times, I would even break out). I have combination skin and it affects the parts of my face differently. It doesn&#x27;t seem to strip all the oils from my nose, but at the same time, the other sections of my face could get very dry if I didn&#x27;t put on a moisturizer after. Overall, I would say that it is decent, but is no miracle product. I&#x27;ve had better and I&#x27;ve had worse organic products. And it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side.</li>
    <li> Works well for oily acne prone skin. Super Detox is runny and does not lather however it is highly effective and a little goes a long way. Gently remove SD with a warm towel and if your skin feels dry after using SD try applying (patting) a small amount of vitamin E or jojoba oil to dry areas before bed. My acne prone skin looks and feels lovely now. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> did not suds and is very costly.&lt;br /&gt;charcoal doesn&#x27;t work on you skin and why they say it does?&lt;br /&gt;there are better products out there for you money</li>
    <li> Although it is not a bad wash, I would not consider this a daily wash. It does not foam and toner cleansin after wash clearly shows that it does not clean as much as it should. The bottle is very small and the product is overpriced for what it really delivers. This also smells like some herb, I&#x27;m not sure what excatly. Overall, not a bad product but too pricey for what it does not deliver. I went through it in two weeks.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and seems to diminishing black heads as advertised. I appreciate that it contains mostly natural and organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d bought this for my teenager daughter, she use it every night. It&#x27;s control her ace and Pore and leave her skin soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Tried it since it was organic but I like my old wash better, didn&#x27;t see any improvement from what mine already did and don&#x27;t like how the charcoal stains</li>
    <li> This is a very very high quality product. It is loaded with botanical extracts. I just started using it and I can tell that it is very good for my skin.</li>
    <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have any pstimple popping with this... which has been a catalyst for severe acne problems I have used this for over two weeks and I will never go back.. I use an oil treatment to moisturize.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. Pricey, but well worth it! If your face is oily, it might not be the best thing for you, and it doesn&#x27;t remove oil as well as some other products. However, your skin will feel soft, and clean!</li>
    <li> Very gentle, cleans deeply without irritating or drying the skin. This has become my one and only cleanser.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on a recommendation from my friend. it works good for them but terribly for me a found it very iterating and drying as well as expensive. comes in a very tiny bottle for the price, the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I know it worked well for my friend, but was a total waste on my end,</li>
