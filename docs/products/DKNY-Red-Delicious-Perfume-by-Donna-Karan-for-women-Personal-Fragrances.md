      <li>I will order  more later.</li>
      <li>I will be shopping for more in the future</li>
      <li>In the bottle it smells exactly like the sort of perfume I like.  </li>
      <li>fast delivery, just what was ordered, wife loves it</li>
      <li>figured i&#x27;d try something new.</li>

    <li> DKNY Red Delicious smells amazing on the right person. Out of all the fragrances I wear I receive 90 percent of of compliments when wearing this. The regular delicious can be suffocating and strong with more than one spray, red delicious is perfect and lasts all day with just 2 or 3. AND IT LASTS I pulled out a winter coat from last year and could smell my red delicious on it, didn&#x27;t need to spray again. PLEASE PLEASE BRING THIS BACK...UN-DISCONTINUE IT...if that&#x27;s even a word.</li>
    <li> I have been in love with this scent for some years. Its a simplistic scent in which to me is a light berry or fruity smell. Based off of Fragrance.net the  fragrance notes are: Lychee, Vanilla Bean, Champagne, Amber, Apple, Red Raspberry, Patchouli, Rose. It&#x27;s a great scent , which you will love. It will be great for day as well as evening wear.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for,this as I love dkny red but this was not dkny red. It smells awful</li>
    <li> This DKNY doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same sent that I remember  from a smaller size that I received as a gift a couple of years ago.</li>
    <li> This product does not even deserve 1 star! When I firstly ordered it, the item was damaged. Wonderful Amazon team replaced an item for me. I though that would be it.... I only used perfume once when it just came and all the time it was on the shelf. Today I wanted to use it but the sprayer broke!!! Really???!!!</li>
    <li> i had the green apple dkny, well it was my mothers and i just never gave it back. i LOVED the way that smelled but figured i&#x27;d try something new. the green apple is perfect for the summer, so i thought for the winter red delicious would be a good choice. i was so right. at first the perfume comes off a little strong, but you have to let it sit for a little while and then its a nice sweet but mature smelling fragrance.</li>
