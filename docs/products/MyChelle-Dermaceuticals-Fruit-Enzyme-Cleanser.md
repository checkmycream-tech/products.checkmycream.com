<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does everything it promises.  Best liquid cleanser I have ever used on my face.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price point.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this cleanser that leaves my face squeaky clean. Pores unclogged after a couple of washes. And my pores definitely look much smaller.</li>
    <li> My aesthetician suggested I try using a fruit enzyme cleanser to help with clogged pores.  This hasn&#x27;t helped and actually seems to have made the problem worse.  However, my husband has had no ill-effects.  Maybe this is better for skin that is a little temperamental than mine.</li>
    <li> Nothing else works for sensitive combination skin.  A wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite face wash! It gets my skin really clean without making it dry. It keeps my pores clean and my skin feels smooth. It&#x27;s gentle and yet strong at the same time-- I don&#x27;t know how they do it. Nice, subtle natural scent, too. The amazing thing is that my daughter also loves this product; she is 19 and I&#x27;m in my fifties -- very different skin types, obviously, but it works great for both of us!  Definitely worth the price; I only need a little bit of product, so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really trust this company and appreciate that they use natural, and animal-friendly ingredients.</li>
    <li> The 4.4 oz bottle lasted me two years without any detriment! A little goes a long way (probably why they skipped using a pump bottle) and that little bit keeps my skin so soft and with the lightest scent. I have combination oily/dry skin and am very sensitive to perfumes and such so if you&#x27;re concerned, I highly recommend trying this! MyChelle.com also sells $20 sampler kits if you&#x27;re interested in trying a variety of their products! Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  It smells great and does a fabulous job washing off my make-up.  It even takes off the waterproof mascara very well.</li>
    <li> I have oily and sensitive skin. This cleanser works great for me. My skin feels fresh and clean after using this cleanser. It does not make my skin feel tight and dry. It has  very pleasant scent, too!</li>
    <li> The packaged was damaged when it arrived so this review is just about the product. It&#x27;s one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used. Leaves my skin smooth and clean without being overly dry. Calms my redness too.</li>
    <li> Great product! Easily washes away dirt and rinses very nicely as well. I would buy again for sure! very nice!</li>
    <li> I have always washed my face with soap and water (well, Molton-Browne and water), but was persuaded to try this by a positive review in a magazine. It gets my face clean without drying. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Not for dry or sensitive skin - much too harsh, strips the skin of natural oils leaving it parched and tight, which is sometimes a good thing, but this cleanser is much to strong for dry/sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used  this product for years.  Every once in a while I try out a different cleanser, but always come back to this one.  It keeps my skin clear and fresh-looking.  It is gently exfoliating without drying the skin.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser, it gets the makeup off and smells nice.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt if you get in eyes.  I have very sensitive skin and have not had any problems and have been using over a year now.  It has a very mild scent, smells bother me too, and it is just lovely.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> For the longest time my facial cleaning routine was to use seabreeze and a cotton ball every night. This didnt dry my skin out much and also made my skin feel smooth. The smoothness was probably a result of the cotton and seabreeze taking off all the dead skin. Taking around cotton balls and seabreze everywhere was getting old... I read many reviews trying to find a good facewash for oily combination skin. I mostly have an oily T zone. mostly shiny oily and not heavy oily. I decided to try this product based on one websites suggestion. After using it once i could tell how good it was. one bottle lasted me 2 months while using it every morning. You only need just under a dime sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly the product is worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great ingredients. I kind of know the ingredients of skin care products well. This one just softly but effectively cleans your skin. I could tell it when I searched all cleansers on Amazon &amp; finally found this with its great ingredients chart. It truly cleans skin as the way I thought. I also bought one for my mom. I may not change my cleanser for next months.&lt;br /&gt;It does not has that much bubble. But it will have enough bubble for cleaning the whole face as the little amount described in product using instruction. Some people may not know how to produce bubble properly when using it. Feel free to ask me.</li>
    <li> The cleaner itself was not bad, but the protection film was opened, I am not sure if it was broken or it was a returned product...</li>
    <li> this stuff is heaven sent! great face product with no harshness!</li>
    <li> Amazing product; I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now.  Really makes your skin feel smooth and clean.  I have congested skin and this helped clear it up big time!  I use it with a wash cloth for gentle exfoliation.  The enzyme scrub in the same formula is also great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on postive reviews and recommedation for healthier skin. I have combination skin as well as senatitvity to chemical based products. I have tried several over-the-counter products and online products; no luck. In fact, lots of products broke out my face more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. Gentle on face &amp; helped my face clear up as well as feeling soft. Great product/brand.</li>
    <li> My current favorite face wash. Fruit enzymes help exfoliate the skin without harsh scrubs. Neutral fragrance, and lasts a long time. Great value!</li>
    <li> Let me start by stating that I rarely write reviews. I feel like I really need to write about this stuff, though. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and had recently resigned to never having nice skin. Enter MyChelle Dermaceuticals. My skin is looking SO much better!! Between this and the pumpkin cream, my skin is almost 100% improved. I&#x27;d tried Proactiv, which was okay but stained everything- sheets, shirts, towels, the lot. I used Oil of Olay, and still do sometimes, but the daily facial wipes were just getting too expensive to use twice a day and I still had forehead bumps. Honestly, with the money I&#x27;ve spent on trying to find the perfect fix I could have bought heaps of MyChelle! I&#x27;m not going to make this long, but please, if you&#x27;re feeling bummed and lost with your skin, give this a try. Don&#x27;t jump into the deep end, as it can be expensive, but get a starter kit or just a couple things and see how you go. I&#x27;m going to post the same thing for the pumpkin cream. Good luck!</li>
    <li> expensive but  good product for cleansing and smoothing skin surface  - though it has enzymatic exfoliative action it is very gentle (I have fair sensitive skin)</li>
    <li> We love this product! It is mild, does not contain nasty chemicals, has a great scent, and works very well to remove oil, dirt, and perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;We have it delivered once a month which seems just about right. We like also the package instead of a pump or other method; the free shipping makes this purchase just about perfect!</li>
    <li> Have been using this cleanser for years.  My face feels so refreshed and clean after using it and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> I like natural products and this was a good find. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of face washes, this one is gentle enough for my sensitive skin, and I feel better knowing that it is good for my skin. I&#x27;ve tried acne washes for my occasional acne issues, but those products dry out my skin and cause more breakouts. I believe this cleanser creates a balance.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since I was a teenager. After looking for a solution to the typical store brands I found Mychelle products. This is an incredible brand that uses natural ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate your face. Love this product, love the brand!</li>
    <li> I love this non-drying, yet effective natural cleanser.</li>
    <li> Two pricey for such a small amount and it has a strange odor</li>
    <li> I love everything about this facewash. It works well, leaves my skin clean and smooth and it smells great!</li>
    <li> cleanses very well. dissolves dirt and makeup, takes dry peeling skin off with AHAs. you still need a peel every so often. very refreshing. great for dry skin, doesn&#x27;t make it tight or dry. you will see that your skin gets brighter. I let it sit for a few minutes before washing off. I like their pumpkin peel too</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cleanser, it does give your face a refreshed feeling!</li>
    <li> Love it- been using it on combination/sensitive skin for years- I alternate between this and the creamy honeydew, highly recommend both.  The bottles last much longer than you would expect.</li>
    <li> I have been buying the cleanser for my daughter for over a year.  It clears her acne up better than other products on the market, and is not loaded with chemicals.  She loves it!  She doesn&#x27;t want to try anything else because this product works great for her.</li>
    <li> I love it and have used it for years. My skin is never dried out from the enzyme cleanser. It is mild and keeps my skin glowing.</li>
    <li> I have had no problems in regards to break outs or redness due to this. That said, this also hasn&#x27;t improved my skin that I could essentially tell. I have been using this for almost a year and I would continue to do so as I haven&#x27;t had any reaction to it, and when worked in, works with my Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m midway through my first bottle of this and so far I&#x27;m impressed with the results. My skin is much calmer, has fewer breakouts, and overall feels clean &amp; looks even toned. I like the fact this cleanser contains AHA - it&#x27;s rare to find effective natural products that work, but this one lives up to its claim. I use this after using Olay wipes to remove my make-up, it gently but thoroughly cleans my skin, and does not leave it feeling dry. It&#x27;s been working really well for my oily/acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good face wash. I was previously using and orange face wash that is much cheaper. This one has a bit more of a &amp;#34;kick&amp;#34; to it. It smells stronger (and very fruity), in a good way and it feels like it leaves my skin quite a bit smoother. Good product, no adverse reactions (and I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this and for the price its awesome.</li>
    <li> Product quality seems different.</li>
    <li> Nice stuff and rated very high</li>
    <li> Used for years! Great product, great price and excellent service.</li>
    <li> I love MyChelle products. This is one of my favorite facial cleansers. I leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped and tight.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love MyChelle products. Everyone comments how my skin seems to glow.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware: lots of studies have shows that AHA s causes PREMATURE AGING by making the skin MORE susceptible to sun damage (a quick Google search will tell you all you need). Definitely pair this with a sunscreen, but for now I&#x27;m going back to my less expensive old standby: Johnson &amp; Johnson Purpose face soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerns over AHA aside, this was a GREAT face soap. It smells delicious, and I&#x27;m often sensitive to essential oils and &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; Whole Foods type face washes but this one didn&#x27;t irritate my face AT ALL. I had very clear skin while using this wash. It is the only organic face wash that I ever used that both worked (perfect for my oily skin, but not overly drying) and was all natural, which I felt wonderful about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MyChelle is a great line overall and I am OBSESSED with their Zinclear SPF 28 sunscreen. If you have oily or acne prone skin wear it under foundation (I use it with a liquid mineral) for all day matte finish -- better than any mattifying product at Sephora or elsewhere and all natural -- that stuff is miraculous</li>
    <li> Great cleanser, love all the MyChelle products. My face is extremely sensitive and I like that it is made from natural ingredients, not harsh chemicals.</li>
