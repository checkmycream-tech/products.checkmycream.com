      <li>it is well worth the purchase.  </li>
      <li>and I must say that this  time she got it right.  </li>

      <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>

      <li>I highly recommend you make sure the actual instant treatment comes in a jar version.</li>
      <li>I have very thick but fine hair and this has helped keep my hair healthy and strong without weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>after reading the reviews, I had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>

      <li>I finally found a product that works well with my natural hair.</li>
      <li>this was just going to be another product that I wasted money on, but it was well worth the $50.  </li>
      <li>It can take a couple of tries to get the amount correct because if you overdo it just a little your hair will truly feel flat and kind of weighed down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this treatment. I have been using it for years. My hair always looks and feels healthier and shinier.</li>
    <li> YES! Had I known then what I know now about this product I would&#x27;ve ordered two jars....but now that I DO know what I know I found a similar product made by that word that start with a Dov_ for a fraction of the cost and with equally great smell, moisturizing agents and lasting softness.</li>
    <li> Deep penetration battles dryness without leaving heavy residue. Easy and pleasant to use</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my hair smooth and shiny no matter what the weather is like. I have tried other brands of haircare products and keep coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> works well in my hair.  My hairdresser recommends it</li>
    <li> I have long hair down to my butt and I highlight it blond. This conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ran into that keeps my hair looking healthy even though I torture it with highlights.</li>
    <li> Esuchen olive Treatments was recommended by my hair dresser and I must say that this  time she got it right.  This poduct is never greasy and really helps dry hair.</li>
    <li> it was good and it arrived in perfect shape into my house! Good job! I am glad I ordered it</li>
    <li> Great for my fine curly hair.  Frizz  way down.  Not to heavy.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I just got this product past Friday, and the hair lotion is actually impressive, no joke! I had been advised this by my own hair dresser and I acknowledge, I was doubtful. My hair is very thick and appears to be on the rough side. I have tested out several products to try to straighten my wavy hair without weighing it down or having it really feel dried out.

    <li> I just received this product last Tuesday, and it is awesome, no lie! AS an African American woman I thought for sure this was just going to be another product that I wasted money on, but it was well worth the $50.  I am transitioning from relaxers and my hair is healthier than it has ever been in years, but I had a problem seeing growth due to dryness and breakage of my ends. So I needed something to protect my ends and this stuff does the trick, when I first applied it I thought I applied too much because an hour later I touched my hair and it felt really greasy so I just knew my hair was going to be a greasy mess in the morning when I flat ironed it.  But it wasn&#x27;t it was soft silky and just unbelievable.  I will be purchasing more, I know its expensive but for a healthy head of good growing hair it is well worth the purchase.  I finally found a product that works well with my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this from my stylist and I admit, I was doubtful. My hair is very thick and tends to be on the coarse side.

Once you have the correct amount to use worked out you will be totally addicted to this stuff!</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews, I had high hopes for this product. I have naturally curly hair. It did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for two years now and there is nothing that compares. It is very hard to find other than on amazon.</li>
    <li> Great leave in product.  Use only a very small amount so this container lasts a long time.  Keeps curly hair tame and shiny.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, color damaged hair and this was recommended by a friend with very thick, curly hair.  I thought it would be too heavy, but it is perfect.  I apply a small less than dime-size amount post blow out to the ends and It does not weigh my hair down, completely covers up my split ends and defrizzes.  Lasts all day long with no need to reapply.  And it smells great.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am 62 years and my hair is in great shape do to this treatment .Highly recomend</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and this is not the same product at all. This is much oilier and there is no inside plastic liner. The jar is much lighter than the one I purchased in the salon. SOmething is not correct here.</li>
    <li> Gives just enough moisture to make your hair look shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> I have really thin, fine hair.  This year, my hair has become frizzy and damaged looking.  It would only look smooth if I straightened it every day (after blow drying) which lead to more damage. I used expensive Aveda products to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my hair, but nothing worked! Then my hair stylist recommended Chihtsai.  I can&#x27;t tell you how amazed I was the first time I used this.  My hair was soft, thicker, manageable, and styleable. Oh...did I tell you I also have greasy hair like a teenager and have to wash my hair daily?  Well now I don&#x27;t. Since using this product I now only wash my hair every other day. It is full of even more body the second day and still so soft.  I also haven&#x27;t needed to straighten my hair since using Chihtsai.  I use a round brush to flip the ends out and it holds. No hairspray either!  This review sounds too good to be true, but it isn&#x27;t. For this price, this tub will last me months. So worth the price and the results.  I finally love my hair! Even my students have commented on how nice my hair looks. Jeesh! was I that teacher with the bad hair before???  Not anymore!</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time and love how it conditions my hair.  Wouldn&#x27;t blow dry without it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was a surprise that I found it in amazon.</li>
    <li> The product was expired! It has a weird smell to it.</li>
    <li> I love this product it adds volume and bounce to my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my wife and she says it is AWESOME!!. She has talked to other members of our family about it and they have ordered a jar for themselves. My wife was very glad I ordered for her...</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I have very thick but fine hair and this has helped keep my hair healthy and strong without weighing it down.  I also use it in my girls&#x27; hair, which is curly and somewhat coarse as they are biracial.  This keep their hair soft and manageable as well.  HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and works as a very light yet effective anti-drying cream for blowdrying. Or you can simply put it in and let your hair dry naturally.</li>
    <li> I have dry, frizzy, wavy, thinning hair. It grows slowly and needs frequent trims despite my attempts to grow healthy hair through vitamins, healthy diet, expensive shampoo/conditioner and infrequent washing. With my upcoming wedding, a new salon gave me a sample and now I&#x27;m hooked. I&#x27;ll never use another product again. I&#x27;ve used a lot of anti-frizz, conditioning, or hair oil products and nothing works. Anti-frizz serum might cover frizz in the morning, but by afternoon, my hair is unhealthy looking again. Chihtsai Olive Instant Treatment actually FIXES and CORRECTS split ends instead of covering it for a short time. My hair was immediately more soft after blow drying, and I needed less trims. I grew healthy hair faster in time for the wedding. Amazon sells it for the best price that I can find, too!</li>
