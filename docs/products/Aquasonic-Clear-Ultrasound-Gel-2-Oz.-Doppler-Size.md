      <li>works much better than just wetting the tens pads with water.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good gel and it lasts longer than one would think.</li>
      <li>What a precious sound.</li>
      <li>Amazing gel works very well, gave us great memories, and we still had a lot left, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get a good sound.</li>

      <li>Works well with the Vendido Por HUGECARE Baby-bump Sound System that we bought.</li>
      <li>and it found the heart rate really quickly and easily.</li>

      <li>It was exactly what it said it was!</li>
      <li>Product works fine, but you&#x27;re just as well off using aloe vera gel which is much cheaper per ounce.</li>
      <li>I can clearly hear my baby&#x27;s heartbeat now :)</li>
      <li>This product is so worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have to say you can use &amp;#34;personal lubricant&amp;#34; and it works a little bit better and much better for the price.</li>
      <li>but it gives me the reassurance I need to make sure the little baby&#x27;s heart is beating at a healthy pace</li>
      <li>Not super sticky, easy to wipe up and easy to use!</li>
      <li>Product works as expected; it works great with my fetal monitor and we hear a clear heartbeat using the gel.  </li>
      <li>Works just as it should and very inexpensive too!  </li>
      <li>I use a dab on my tens unit pads and can reuse the pads several more times than without this,  </li>
      <li>I used to do my clinical&#x27;s and most of the rehab that I&#x27;ve been to- used the same gel.</li>
      <li>Exactly what it says it is.</li>
      <li>Even 2 dollars is too much for this!</li>
      <li>This product had come really fast!</li>
      <li>As I used the sample, I bought more of the same product.</li>
      <li>and it only needed a battery :)</li>
      <li>I bought the smaller version since I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed to use the at home fetal heart monitor.</li>
      <li>Heartbeat is loud and clear :]</li>

      <li>This thought it was very well</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and works well</li>
      <li>I used aloe vera gel and it worked just as well and was much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Just as described and fast shipping</li>
      <li>It looks adorable with the pink color since we are having a girl</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m giving it 4 star for now since it arrived so fast.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use much at all.</li>
      <li>Tube lasted almost my whole pregnancy from when I started to hear the baby&#x27;s heartbeat with my Doppler.</li>
      <li>No matter how much I changed out the battery</li>
      <li>This product makes it so much easier to use our at-home doppler.</li>
      <li>Works very well with my fetal doppler.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little inaccurate I think as far as catching the exact heart rate</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I had originally thought.</li>
      <li>I was able to hear my baby&#x27;s heart back at only 13 weeks!!!</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
      <li>I would highly  recommend this ultrasound gel to anyone who uses a doppler.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We bought the fetal heart Doppler an used this gel on my tummy to pick up our first and second baby&#x27;s heart beats at home! What a precious sound. Shipped fast and works well</li>
    <li> Definitely enhanced my at home doppler, I won&#x27;t use my doppler without it now !</li>
    <li> This gel does exactly what it is supposed to as my wife and I purchased a small ultra-sounds to hear our baby&#x27;s heart beat.  There is plenty of gel here and it would take us many more ultra-sounds to use up this bottle.  A very nice value and works as promised.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my purchase! Doppler works beautifully. I am 14 weeks pregnant. Heartbeat is loud and clear :] Even came with free batteries and gel! Works as well as the doctors. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> it is just as described - clear ultrasound gel, works well.</li>
    <li> This ultrasound gel was great with my fetal heartbeat montitor, which didn&#x27;t come with any gel. Good price too. It was exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Amazing gel works very well, gave us great memories, and we still had a lot left, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get a good sound.</li>
    <li> I bought this shortly after I bought a fetal monitor.  I bought the smaller version since I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work.  It worked like a charm and I have since bought bigger bottles!</li>
    <li> I use this for my fetal Doppler that I bought. It works great and I don&#x27;t have to use much at all. This will probably last me for years.</li>
    <li> Product works fine, but you&#x27;re just as well off using aloe vera gel which is much cheaper per ounce.</li>
    <li> Perfect to use with my doppler. I can clearly hear my baby&#x27;s heartbeat now :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with my angel sounds Doppler. I was told I could use water or aloe Vera gel, but I was more pleased with the sounds when I used this. Tube lasted almost my whole pregnancy from when I started to hear the baby&#x27;s heartbeat with my Doppler.</li>
    <li> works great. but for the price you could get a jumbo size of aloe vera gel that would last the entire pregnancy</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to use the at home fetal heart monitor. Its just like the stuff they use at my doctors office for ultrasounds!</li>
    <li> Paired this with a fetal heart monitor. It doesn&#x27;t work well without it. This gel is a must.</li>
    <li> This gel worked great with my doppler, however after I used it up I decided to try and use something else instead of buying another tube. I used aloe vera gel and it worked just as well and was much cheaper. It didn&#x27;t ruin my doppler either.     If you are using a fairly expensive doppler and you dont want to risk the chance of ruining it by using gel that isn&#x27;t listed as &#x27;safe to use with the product&#x27; then buy this gel. Otherwise I would try some aloe (or similar) gel from your local drug store.</li>
    <li> I have used this gel throughout 3 different pregnancies and it works GREAT with my at home doppler! Not super sticky, easy to wipe up and easy to use!</li>
    <li> This product had come really fast! I haven&#x27;t used it yet cause my fetal doppler haven&#x27;t even arrive yet. But I&#x27;ll write another review telling you guy&#x27;s how it is, but I think it will go awesome with my doppler :). So I&#x27;m giving it 4 star for now since it arrived so fast.  February 03,2012  edit review:  This stuff go nicely with my doppler :) awesome but now I need a bigger one.  This product is really small.</li>
    <li> Works well with the Vendido Por HUGECARE Baby-bump Sound System that we bought.</li>
    <li> Works great. No complaints</li>
    <li> This works well and the size is perfect if you are just trying to find your baby&#x27;s heart beat during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just as described and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This little bit lasted me my whole pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I would highly  recommend this ultrasound gel to anyone who uses a doppler.  Good sound conductor and cleans up good.</li>
    <li> inexpensive and works for my little baby monitor perfectly.</li>
    <li> This worked with our doppler just fine and could hear our growing baby&#x27;s heartbeat!</li>
    <li> Although this product works as it should, it is very small.  I went through my gel in about 2 weeks at most.  I would suggest to buy a product with more in it.</li>
    <li> Bought the doppler, which came with a sampler of this clear gel. As I used the sample, I bought more of the same product. It worked as expected. Would recommend for those that have a doppler and are looking for refill.</li>
    <li> Good product but I wish the size was bigger for the price. That&#x27;s why I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars. I have to say you can use &amp;#34;personal lubricant&amp;#34; and it works a little bit better and much better for the price.</li>
    <li> Works just as it should and very inexpensive too!  This product makes it so much easier to use our at-home doppler. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cheap but very good. it&#x27;s water based so it doesn&#x27;t give you a sticky feeling after use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use with my sonoline B fetal heart monitor once the supplied gel was used up.  Works great.  Will purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with the AngelSounds Jumper doppler.  This gel works fine, but I also discovered that baby oil works just as well.  Not necessary to purchase, but if you want actual ultrasound gel for some reason (allergies?)  this works fine.</li>
    <li> As described, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Works good with my fetal doppler I have</li>
    <li> Very good product. Easy to operate. It is nice to have, especially in early pregnancy before baby starts kicking, because it give that reassurance for moms that everything is ok. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what it said it was! And its the same one ultrasound techs use! I took a star because it took forever to get here!</li>
    <li> Quick serves and Good product</li>
    <li> Works very well with my fetal doppler.</li>
    <li> works well and is inexpensive</li>
    <li> Came on time. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It came broken and I am using it with it held together with black electrical tape. Pretty much junk.</li>
    <li> Product works as expected; it works great with my fetal monitor and we hear a clear heartbeat using the gel.  It arrived on time with good packaging.</li>
    <li> The gel is great if you have a hand held fetal doppler.  I got this because of my high risk pregnancy the gel goes on smooth and conducts with the doppler very nicely.</li>
    <li> Works well with my infant heart monitor</li>
    <li> I saw some reviews that sated this gel was kind of thick and tacky which for my purposes is great.  I use a dab on my tens unit pads and can reuse the pads several more times than without this,  works much better than just wetting the tens pads with water.  I also put some in a small bottle so it can evaporate more of the water out of the product and make it even thicker.</li>
    <li> Works great quick shipping</li>
    <li> after I received the little doppler I noticed the instructions said &amp;#34;use with oil or lotion&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s it! anything will work, no need to buy the ultrasound gel... although it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This product is so worth the price. I was able to hear my baby&#x27;s heart back at only 13 weeks!!! It was clear and loud. It looks adorable with the pink color since we are having a girl and it only needed a battery :)</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, item as expected</li>
    <li> Great gel to use for my fetal Doppler radar!</li>
    <li> I was about 28 weeks along when I got this and it found the heart rate really quickly and easily. It&#x27;s a little inaccurate I think as far as catching the exact heart rate but it gives me the reassurance I need to make sure the little baby&#x27;s heart is beating at a healthy pace...set my mind at ease a few time for sure!</li>
    <li> Good product. Works great with baby doppler. I would recommend this product. Easy to wipe off and does not stain clothes.</li>
    <li> I bought a portable ultrasound that I used at home. I had it since year 2006. I used to do my clinical&#x27;s and most of the rehab that I&#x27;ve been to- used the same gel. So I look for this product here in amazon because as of now we&#x27;re living overseas and I don&#x27;t have any problem using it. It is sticky but afterwards I wipe it with wet towel to clean it up. I never have any allergy or what so ever; great for ultrasound. I recommend this for everyone.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says it is.</li>
    <li> Very bad gel. Very thick and sticky. I couldn&#x27;t even use it. I threw it out.I feel sorry I even spend money on this. Even 2 dollars is too much for this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good gel and it lasts longer than one would think. It&#x27;s smaller than I had originally thought.</li>
    <li> It worked as intended, but does require a lot to use the home doppler, so this little 2 oz tube doesn&#x27;t last for long if you&#x27;re listening even once a week or so.</li>
    <li> I bought my cousin a baby monitor  she said the gel  work with great with the monitor  I do recommend this product</li>
    <li> When I purchased the Bebe Sounds Prenatal Heart Listener, it was suggested that I purchase this item with it by Amazon. I knew nothing about the heart monitor nor what it entailed so I trusted Amazon when they suggested I purchase this ultrasound gel along with it. However, when I received the Heart Listener I found that this ultrasound gel was not needed. The cheap price I felt was not worth returning it, so now I&#x27;m stuck with ultrasound gel. Guess I could drop it off at a hospital.</li>
    <li> I does what it says and I would purchase product again. It&#x27;s not sticky and dries without leaving to much residue.</li>
    <li> it was a good product</li>
    <li> Yucky and gooey. It actually got stuck in my doppler. A little thicker than it should be maybe?</li>
    <li> It was delivered as promised and worked wonderful, but only for a couple of days... No matter how much I changed out the battery it didn&#x27;t work...and the aqua sonic gelee I bought for it also didn&#x27;t work well at all. Water worked much better to hear my baby&#x27;s heartbeat... I am disappointed about the product, I really wanted to record my baby&#x27;s heartbeat and couldn&#x27;t:(</li>
    <li> Bought for a price... but the Aloe Gel from WM works in the same way... didn&#x27;t find any difference ....</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for the Doppler we have!</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to</li>
    <li> A little thick, but works great with our hand held doppler</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product This thought it was very well just like in the doctor&#x27;s office We are so happy</li>
