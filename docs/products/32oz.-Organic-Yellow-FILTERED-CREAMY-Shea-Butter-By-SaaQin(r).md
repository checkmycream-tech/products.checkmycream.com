<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A little hard to get out of the tub. Will try body butter recipe listed right on the tub. Makes skin super soft without being greasy.</li>
    <li> So, I have very oily skin &amp; I can&#x27;t use this on my face, but I use it on my feet and it is a life saver! About once per week I work on my feet for maintenance. Once toenails are clipped (if necessary) and heels are smoothed out (if necessary), I apply a liberal amount of shea butter to my feet (tops and bottoms, getting all crevices). Then I put socks on and go to bed. Once I wake up in the morning, my feet are beautiful and very smooth. I&#x27;ve never had ugly feet, but I think this stuff is so good it can turn ugly into something you&#x27;d brag about. At times when I don&#x27;t have lip gloss, I even apply it to my lips. It has a smooth finish, but pretty greasy. You don&#x27;t want to use too much. It melts in your hands, so always start with a little bit then work your way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strange. It smells like Cocoa Butter mixed with cooking oil &amp; a little hint of charcoal. Very weird, but not too overwhelming that I&#x27;d stop using it. A lot of people debate whether or not this is real shea butter or fake, but I don&#x27;t care. It gets the job done and it lasts a LONG time, like years (in my experience). I will buy it over and over!</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM WORTH EVERY PENNY, REALLY!!!  I&#x27;VE USED THIS TYPE OF SHEA BUTTER FOR ABOUT 2 1/2 YEARS NOW AND THIS ORDER WAS NO DIFFERENT. I LOVE IT AND RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.  I USE IT S A DEEP CONDITIONER AND IT WORKS GREAT, NOSE MOISTURIZER ( I STAY IN ARIZONA MOVED FROM LOUISIANA AND MY NOSE IS ALWAYS DRY), SUN SCREEN, DRY SKIN, YOU CAN MELT IT AND USE IT A HOT OIL TREATMENT FOR YOUR HAIR OR BODY MASSAGE OIL AS WELL!  ANOTHER TIP IS THAT A 32oz WILL LAST YOU FOREVER, REALLY FOREVER AND IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PIC!</li>
    <li> My mother in law first introduced me to raw unrefined African Shea butter and oh I am sooooo glad that she did. She would smother my daughter with it after every bath and I started to notice how conditioned and &#x27;dewy&#x27; her skin looked, I mean she &#x27;GLOWED&#x27; so I decided to use it and I LOVE the stuff! I ordered the 32oz but next time I shall order the 5lb batch to make it more economical!     I do like it filtered but I prefer the &#x27;unrefined&#x27; unfiltered better, it probably contains more nutrients than the filtered who knows I am not a Scientist! I use the Black African soap with Shea butter as I have overly dry skin(I get mine off a reliable seller from TX on ebay, its much cheaper!)and smother myself head to toe with Shea butter after every shower - not only does my skin look and feel great BUT I love that you can see the immediate effects instead of waiting for 6 weeks for to see any change. Its nourishing, earthy, nutty you can even smell the African soil! I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all after all its 100% natural so what do you expect it to smell like Chanel No. 5??? - its off putting at first but the MANY MANY benefits far out way a small detail such as the smell - I just use Victoria Secret body spray (I am allergic to most perfumes) over it sometimes if I&#x27;m going out. I mean it could of been worse and smelled like a Rhino&#x27;s backside! So goodbye to Dove, Clinique and Aveeno!    I shall be searching around other sites for the best deals on bulk buy as there are four of us in the family and we get through a lot!-  also Shea butter loses its potency after 2 years so that&#x27;s plenty of time for us to get through a box load! I also make a face pomade with Shea butter, Castor Oil and Virgin Olive oil (Castor Oil being the lowest ratio) - great for my dry &#x27;crocodile&#x27; skin!</li>
    <li> I found this to have more of a playdough consistency. I haven&#x27;t used it because it feels like I&#x27;ll have to warm it up, roll it around in my hands first and that butter will be getting on the floor. When applied, it was thick and I worried about it getting on my clothing. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a solution???, so far it has not been usable for me.</li>
    <li> I am amazed that my order to arrived 2 days before the anticipated arrival date and how nicely the shea butter was packaged. Also, I am a naturally curly girl with hair that needs A LOT of moisture. However, due to the affordable price and the amount of shea that came with the package,I might make shea apart of my everyday skin regimen. I have yet to find something better or cheaper.      I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed in this product. I found it to be too heavy and oily. I had a bad breakout after using this on my face(I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s)!</li>
    <li> Read about this a lot and butter and you have purchased the pack and packaging is excellent and very excited to try Mbdaúaa will give her five stars and then I put the experience you will assess the actual</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It really keeps my skin moisturized especially in the winter. I personally like to mix this with coconut oil so that&#x27;s it&#x27;s easier to apply. I was expecting it to come in the package that it&#x27;s pictured in but it was actually in a square plastic container with no info. I really like this product and will buy again once it runs out.</li>
    <li> On the recommendation of my dermatologist, I started using Shea Butter for a severe case of eczema that I&#x27;ve had about 2 years now.  The eczema is pretty much all over my body (with just a little eczema on my hands, face, and scalp; and none on my feet), so I&#x27;ve been using alot of the  Shea Butter.  Since this is the first time I&#x27;ve used it, I can&#x27;t say if good Shea Butter is what I&#x27;m about to describe.    It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I started using the Shea Butter.      FIRST IMPRESSIONS  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  -It&#x27;s like wax, but melts when rubbed on your skin.  -For large areas, I use my thumb to crack the butter and then rub it between the palms of my hands and the consistency becomes more spreadable.  -For smaller areas, I rub the butter with my fingertip and it melts the butter.  -It covers well and even makes water bead up on your skin.  Washing it off your hands afterwards is a little hard.  -Initially, it was very greasy and I spent alot of time waiting for it to soak in (30 min+).  It may have been because I put too much...not sure.    -People have described the smell as &#x27;nutty.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but is noticable.  Some days more than others.  Some days not at all.  If you&#x27;re using just a little, it should be no problem.  In the volume I use it, I can smell it.    -It didn&#x27;t have immediate medicinal properties.  I would put it on places that were dry and/or itchy and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything (not like some of the other stuff like Gold Bond or Aquaphor)...but, read on.    THREE WEEKS LATER  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  -After using it religiously, it has made a big impact on my skin.  -Applying it to problem areas, these areas are now healing and discoloration from the eczema are lightening.    -I don&#x27;t know if my skin is absorbing it faster, or I just don&#x27;t need to put as much on, but it started feeling much less greasy after about a week of using it.      Other lotions and creams I&#x27;ve tried...  Cetaphil Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, Eucerin Lotion, Eucerin Cream, Aquaphor, Lubriderm Lotion, Sebamed Lotion, Sebamed Dry Skin Lotion, Azulene, Calendula, Floursone, Cerave, Bag Balm, and Gold Bond.  While all are fine products, none of them has helped me like Shea Butter.      Not knowing there was Western and Eastern versions, I got the Western. I may try the Eastern version, but so far, I&#x27;ve found this Western type to be excellent.      CONCLUSION  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  Shea Butter didn&#x27;t have immediate benefits, but has helped me over time (although a couple weeks isn&#x27;t long).  The only caveat I have is that I am using a medium strength steroid, but I&#x27;ve used it with all the other lotions/creams too.  While products like Aquaphor or Gold Bond seemed to have immediate benefits, neither of them had long term benefits.  It is a bit greasy, but if you&#x27;re using it in small quantities, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  Using it now for 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve really seen a difference.  I&#x27;ve had some bad flares in certain areas that are now just discolored.  Alot of the discolored areas seemed to have lightened.  I&#x27;ve taken a small jar and use it when I&#x27;m out and about.  Any area that becomes itchy/dry I apply it as much as needed.  I&#x27;ve applied it more on problem spots and they&#x27;ve all gotten better.  I&#x27;ve also put it on my face.  Makes me more shiny than my normal shine, but seems to be making my skin less dry. Overall, it&#x27;s helped me quite a bit.    UPDATE-6/25/10  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  It&#x27;s been about 3 months now and I&#x27;ve used about 64oz.  I&#x27;m a firm believer.  When I flare, the Shea Butter (over a few days) helps.  I would say that there are others things I need to watch, but for my skin, this has worked (by far) the best.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd order and each batch has been a little bit different.  The original ones were more blocky.  This last one is a lot smoother.  They all &#x27;melt&#x27; and become spreadable.  The smoother one just melted faster.  But, overall, they all seem to work the same.  I&#x27;ve also found that getting the 16oz container makes it easier to get the SheaButter out when you get to the bottom of the container.  The 32oz is a little deep and it&#x27;s hard to get to the Shea butter when you get to the bottom.  This has been great stuff.  Ordering is easy and delivered in a timely manner.  The cost is very affordable (especially for the quantity that you get).</li>
    <li> This was my first order from Amazon and I can say it was a good experience.The product it ok not really sure what I want to use it for yet but over great experience.</li>
    <li> i love this product you only need a small amount it goes a long way can also be used on scalp</li>
    <li> I bought this b/c I heard so many good things about Shea Butter...I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on this product!....It&#x27;s so moisturizing and my skin stays soft all day long!...I like this particular Shea Butter b/c it doesn&#x27;t come in chunks and it&#x27;s easy to apply to my skin!...I&#x27;ve tried many lotions and body butters and this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used to moisturize my skin...I&#x27;ve already reccommended this to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving how well this moisturizes my skin...I put it on in the morning and it keeps my skin soft and supple all day...And this particular product is very creamy and easy to apply to my skin...I bought two of these so that it would last me for a while!:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of shea butter asa general use moisturizer and this brand is smooth and creamy. A great price too.</li>
    <li> This works great as a skin moisturizer and hair oil.  I melt it and add some natural oils to make it more oily and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> The product is the best moisturizer that I have ever used. The only downfall is that it carries a small odor to it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shea butter thinking it would be like the others. Nope. It was nice and creamy and melts so easily in my hands. If you can tolerate the smell, I say go for it.</li>
    <li> I used to use Johnson and Johnson Purpose Lotion, but, I wanted something more natural.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with using this as a moisturizer.  The smell is almost like raw clay or Play Doh, but please don&#x27;t let that deter you.  Your skin will glow, and you can use this all over your body to moisturize.  This also gives your skin a nice even tone and smoothes out the blemishes.    Great product, and what a steal at only a few dollars for like a years worth of use if you use this every day all over your body.</li>
    <li> The product that arrived was white.  It is hard and there is no oil in it.  Maybe it&#x27;s the filtering process, but I don&#x27;t like the texture.  It does not melt well.  I have used shea butter for years, and this is the 1st time I have gotten this quality before.  It&#x27;s suppose to be yellow and melt easily.  I had to put this in the microwave, and it doesn&#x27;t absorb in your skin like pure shea butter.  I don&#x27;t know what happened, maybe old, or maybe it&#x27;s the filtering process, but I am not pleased.  However, the service was expedient, therefore I give it two stars.</li>
    <li> I recently went natural (ditched my relaxer) about 4 months ago and my hair became really dry during the transition. This product does have smokey/nutty smell but it works really well. No matter what else I used my hair would be extremely dry and hard to comb until I started using this product. I used a light amount to grease my scalp everyday for best results.</li>
    <li> From Ellen (not Joel) I usually buy another shea butter, but decided to try this one since it said creamy.  Well, it LESS creamy than the other one.  It is the consistency of play-dough that&#x27;s been around for awhile. Very difficult to rub in.  Also, it is bright yellow, which doesn&#x27;t make sense.  This yellow has stained my sheets and my clothing because the product is so difficult to get totally creamed and rubbed in.  I do NOT recommend this product and wish I had returned it and purchased my original one (which I have done recently under my own account) before using it for as long as I did.  As it is, I used about half and am tossing the rest.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest- I&#x27;ve been using for a year I am complinented on the softness of my skin often.</li>
    <li> This is actually Kpangnan butter or African butter. I did some research and found out that people call it \\&quot;Golden Shea butter\\&quot; even though it&#x27;s not real Shea butter. Shea butter comes from a different tree it is supposed to be between white and pale yellow. This company should advertise it as kpangnan butter. It is very good but not the same thing.      That fact aside...kpagnan butter is a really good cream. I love it.    Pros:  - It makes your skin feel sooo silky and plain good. I&#x27;ve never felt anything like it except for real shea butter.  - it melts pretty easily. Of course I also live in a warm climate.  - It is fun to melt it in your hands  - Your skin absorbs it pretty well  - It&#x27;s natural  - It has vitamins in it     Cons:  - potentially the smell. It has a nutty, smoky, greasy smell to it. It doesn&#x27;t really bother me so much considering the benefits and it is not overpowering in my opinion.  - You have to take a moment to melt it in your hands before applying.      My experience with this company was good. The itme came very quickly - 3 days before the expected arrival date. It came as pictured - same tub and sticker with \\&quot;Golden shea butter\\&quot; in it. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. Although this is not real shea butter, It&#x27;s still an exellent lotion.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with how this arrived. There were thumbprints on the top and when I opened the canister, the shea butter had a strange look. It just looked like too many people had been touching it. Then as I dug some out, I could see some kind of oily substance in between the butter, like something had been added in. It was just gross. I won&#x27;t get this again. I&#x27;ll just stick to ordering from where I usually do instead of looking for a deal.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with persistant severe eczema of the hands (with occasional occurance in other areas) for several years now and have yet to find a product that pleastant or not gives me results meaning full use of my hands back. Till now anyways :), after a few months of online research and realizing I was getting down to my last few options I decided to try this since it was the most cost efficent choice. Im EXTROIDINARILY HAPPY I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give this product a good trial before posting my review. I ordered the product on Feb. 14th 2011 recieved on Feb. 16th 2011 in excellent condition. It was well packed in a single 32 ounce container with tape around the lid there were no leaks. The tape was easily removed and I portioned some of the product into 1 small plastic container and two plastic bags. Upon first observation the scent wasnt off putting but it wasnt exactly pleasant. If your worried about the scent please dont within 4 days of removing it from its original container it lost the unpleasant notes which were apparently from the plastic tub and now it only has the mild smokey scent that reminds me of an outdoor campfire, all three samples I portioned out reguardless of storage have the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the one month and one day I have been using this product ive seen remarkable results. I have tried many natural butters, oils, and waxes in various combinations but none can compete with this alone. This product has been so effective for me my doctor approved of me going off the topical perscription medication I had been on. Even after discontinuing the perscription I have seen further results with the use of this butter alone. In the time ive had it using it one to five times a day depending on what tasks im doing I have only used a little over 1/4 cup of the total amount. Each application consists of a piece of product the size of a garbanzo bean which treats my hands, wrists, and a portion of my lower arm with excellent coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a long review but I cant express how thankful I am that I tried this product! I already have arthritis which gives me a hard enough time. Being able to heal my skin has been tremendous in giving me functionality in everyday tasks. I will continue to use this product as long as it is effective for me, it is such a wonderful multitasker. I also would not hesitate to order from this company again as I experianced no problems with my order though I do wish it had come in two smaller tubs for conveniance purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This is not medical advice just my personal experiance in using the above product.this is a long review but I cant express how thankful I am that I tried this product!

    <li> I&#x27;d like to share all the people want to buy this butter my trial that this product is very very nice for all skin ..&lt;br /&gt;and I advice every one 2 try it... about the seller it&#x27;s very nice to deal with this seller ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks..</li>
    <li> Great value.  i put it on my skin after showering then put another lotion over that,as i have extremely dry skin .  I haven&#x27;t found the perfect combination of lotion with it but I&#x27;m sure I will eventually.</li>
    <li> This she a butter is so grainy. I would not suggest it to anyone and will not be buying it again. I will be looking around for the white shea butter.........the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Update: just recieved my african sheabutter all I can say is OMG the quality is great. The size is great for the price. Took longer to get it but so worth the wait. Will so buy again and tell others to buy. The vendor was pleasant and kept his word about getting me my order. Please disgard all past negative remarks.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is great. It makes my skin feel like silk. I am hooked and will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I AM SO PLEASED WITH THE SELLER.  THE PRODUCT WAS SHIPPED OUT WAY AHEAD OF TIME.  THE SHEA BUTTER IS OF A GOOD QUALITY.  THE PRICE IS EXCELLENT.  SHEA BUTTER KEEPS MY SKIN YOUNG AND MOIST YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW I AM FIFTY PLUS.  A MUST BUY IF YOU WANT BEAUTIFUL SKIN AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It conditions my dry skin like no other.I recommend this for anyone dealing with hyper-pigmentation and/or dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it is the pure form of Shea Butter rather than a lotion that has trace amounts in it.  It melts in your hand so it is easy to use, and keeps well.  I have extremely dry skin, and it really makes my skin soft and keeps it that way for a long time (nearly all day!)... unlike lotions that work for an hour or two.  I live in a very dry climate so it tends to suck the moisture right out of your skin, hair, nails, etc... so I really needed something that worked all day since I don&#x27;t have time to reapply frequently during the day.  My skin is also very itchy, and after using this the itchyness has gone away completely.  My husband uses it for his Psoriasis and it made his skin soft and the condition nearly go away.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends, and I will be purchasing this again when it is gone.</li>
    <li> My first experience with shea butter was some years ago.  I had bought the hard version from a health food store and what I remember the most about it was how challenging it was to manipulate.  I don&#x27;t even remember anything else.  I am not sure if I kept it or not.      I had heard about the benefits of using shea butter as a hair/scalp conditioner and skin moisturizer so I was disappointed with my first experience.  When I saw this creamy version I ordered it and I love it!      The nutty scent isn&#x27;t overpowering as a lot of people state in their reviews. In fact, I actually like the smell of it.  Makes me think of chocolate candy. I use if after I shower and mix it in with my lotion and it silkens my skin; seals in the moisture much better than using lotion alone.  It is a great sealant on my hair and scalp after shampooing as well and it keeps my scalp feeling healthy instead of scaly.  I certainly plan to order again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb!  It melts quickly in the palm of your hand and leaves the skin smooth and silky.  I combine it with a little coconut oil to make it even richer.  It was recommended by a family member and I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert where the temperature reaches 100 degrees often....but I noticed my skin didn&#x27;t have any moisture or luster to it. I was using a countless selections of lotions but this butter has beat them all! I love the way it feels on my skin and all the benefits that come from using the product! I also am going natural and tend to use it on my hair for conditioning it and moisturizing it and am extremely happy with the shea butter! I was concerned about the product being watery but I received it solid and yellow just as pictured! I am very pleased with the seller and the product and I plan on ordering a larger quantity of it!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing this product and was very impressed with the comments. Although it took awhile to actually receive my shipment,I am completely satisfied. I emailed the company and inquired about how long it takes to ship and receive. Amazon had one date but I didn&#x27;t actually receive it until about a week and a 1/2 later. As far as the product itself, it works wonders. I use it on my skin,lips,and hair as well as my childrens.2 of my children have extremely dry skin and,it starts to melt and penetrate the skin immediately. I love this product. The quantity and quality are excellent. The smell is not as fragrant as I thought it would be, but I just mix it with pure coconut oil and it smells just fine. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone wanting a good quality product. It was definately worth the wait and price is just right.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I do mix a little bit of coconut oil in with it to make it go on smother</li>
    <li> This item works really well on overnight moister!  Price was great-  Make sure to mix with some sort of castor oil or warm up with hand or hair will break off during application</li>
    <li> My friend had some 100% shea butter that was smooth and creamy and easy for spreading on skin. I then searched for a \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; butter and found that word in this description. However, this butter is more like a lump of lard than creamy. I have to dig it out and then trying to spread on my skin is a joke as it falls into clumps. I can only apply well if I heat it first and it turns into a warm oil. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still therapeutic, but what a pain! Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased.  Item arrived as described ... not much more I can say!  Glad I bought it!  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 11 years old and has the chickenpox. Along with oatmeal baths (an old sock stuffed with oatmeal tied at the end, pharmacist advise) and applying shea butter, she has had almost total relief from the itching. I have used calamine lotion, and aveeno lotion, but the best results was the shea butter. She says that the relief lasts much longer and she slept throughout the night with no problems at all. I already use it for my hair and skin and absolutely love it! I have two other kids who will probably get the chickenpox too. I will go straight into using shea butter instead of spending my money on things that does not work as well.</li>
    <li> This product works so well it mosturizes your size without making your skin oily!! I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone. And the item shipped on time:) will do business again</li>
    <li> My dad has always told me to switch from lotion to shea butter, once I got this I was surprised of how big it really is. Like the Trader Joe Coconut Oil, I use this product everyday from head to toe. I hope to start mixing my own body butters and lotions with these simple products. These are the only things I need for this lovely brown body!! lol enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I have to get used to the texture and the smell at first. It is gritty, and It smells like burnt nut. However, to my surprise, my skin was really soft after I used it. It is so nice on the knees and elbows. It is a wonderful product for dry skin. However, if you are into nice smelling lotion, this product is not for you.</li>
    <li> I used a different shea butter during my first pregnancy and knew I wanted a boat load of it for my second. Still no stretch marks! Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy the real Shea Better. It makes your skin look amazing. I just wish it was a little smoother and not in a lot of chunks.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the African Shea Butter! As soon as I got it, I whipped it with my cocoa butter and other ingredients and made a wonderful hair butter and then a creamy body butter. Makes my hair and skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin. I started looking for a product that would help my excessively dry legs. They were so dry that the texture was noticeably rough.    I love using Vaseline, but I don&#x27;t always want something quite so thick. The Shea butter was a natural alternative. They are both occlusive moisturizers, which means they lock in the moisture, so they are better when you apply them after a shower.    This product was slightly grainy to the feel, but I do not care about that. It melts into oily goodness for your skin. I love how it feels on my lips and legs and face. As I mentioned, I often use straight Vaseline, so the oiliness or greasiness does not bother me. I like it.    At first I thought the product was odorless. Then I noticed a faint smell and thought perhaps it was spoiling. Not because it smelled BAD, but because at first I thought it should not have any odor. I looked it up and that smell is naturally occurring. I&#x27;ve had moisturizers that went bad--they start to smell a bit old. Once I realized the smell was natural I stopped caring. I don&#x27;t mind it whatsoever. It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to you--it&#x27;s mostly noticeable in the container.    Overall I am happy with this product and will absolutely order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard lots of positive things about raw unrefined shea butter for Black natural hair on youtube, so I went ahead and ordered this.  Wow. It keeps my hair sooooo soft!!! (retaining moisture in my hair is a challenge). Also, it is great for my skin. I unfortunately had an irritaion from shaving under my arms, and in one night after applying the shea butter, my under arms are almost back to normal! I LOVE this product.      I bought the 32 oz, which came in two 16 oz containers (which I&#x27;m actually glad it came this way), but I will have this for a LONG time because a little goes a LONG way.      One more thing, I bought this through Nature and Herbs.  It was shipped the same day I ordered it! I bought it on the 16th, and it arrrived on the 18th, just in time for my birthday.  One of the best gifts I ever bought myself :)</li>
    <li> The pure African shea butter filtered creamy does not smell as good as the yellow raw nor does it feel as soft. It takes a little longer to melt in your hands. it works just the same and am continuing with the use, although next time i will buy the yellow like i did the first time. It still absorbs into my skin nicely and makes my skin so soft. It also keeps my lips from getting chapped. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I love this butter and the price is right and the amount is fantastic. I use it under my makeup every day and makeup stays on and at night it is easy to remove and my face looks wonderful or so my husband says</li>
    <li> This shea butter was gritty as though contaminated with sand - not what I&#x27;d want to apply to my face at all.  I doubt that it really was filtered as they claim.  And the smell was off-putting, like smoke, not I&#x27;ve come to expect from shea butter at all.</li>
    <li> This cream is good the smell is ok not bad not good. This does keep your skin moisturized all day you can warm it in the microwave to make it easier to put on. Also this product is a good lip balm.</li>
    <li> Great for hair. It lasts a long time, been using for years. Recommended for skin and hair, great moisturizer. Ships quickly.</li>
    <li> I just started using 100% pure Shea Butter and I love it.  I suffer with osteoarthritis in both knees and found rubbing the Shea Butter on them helps tremendously. The Shea Butter is gritty at first, but I rub the Shea butter in my hands to get the lumps out before applying it to any area of my body.  I also love the way it feels on my skin.  It&#x27;s a winner in my book!</li>
    <li> This shea butter is great for your skin. Leaves your skin moisturized and feeling smooth. It can be greasy, but it&#x27;s worth it. Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> Shea butter was smooth, creamy and easy to blend with oils to make body butter. Milld scent absorbed lavender well. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never be ashy again! Until I run out of Shea butter and have to order more LOL&lt;br /&gt;Mix it with a few drops of your favorite essential oil for a tantalizing smell, I mixed mine with a bit of blood orange essential oil and did a personal batch with lavender essential oil. Raw unrefined shea butter from Ghana will give your skin superior hydration and puts lotions to shame. I put it on before bed and my skin stays conditioned throughout the following day, which is saying A LOT because I live in the desert in Arizona. This is a superior product and quality that only the fertile African lands can produce, stop stalling and get your shea butter today!</li>
    <li> We first were introduced to African Shea Butter at an Ethnic Fair in the Chicago area. My husband used all that we bought at that time. He absolutely wanted the same product to continue to use; so after a search, I ordered it for his birthday. We now have enough to share. It is excellent for skin health. Wonderful non-greasy feeeling with long lasting results. We were delighted with the service from the Amazon provider!</li>
    <li> This is like a miracle moisturizer in a platic 320z tub! I have tried many different types of lotions, butter, creams, ointments etc. but this one is the best so far. I was first a little skeptical because of some the reviews I read said it smelt funny and I didn&#x27;t want to buy a product like that but I figured $7 dollars won&#x27;t hurt. At first when you put it on it does have a scent that is different from the stuff I have bought before that has perfume added (which can cause breakouts) but the scent is very light and it isn&#x27;t offensive, also the scent is gone usually in 30 mins. This ASB is so good to my skin I actually care enough to use it twice a day. When I put it on in the morning before I go out the house and then come back home and prepare to take a bath I can still feel how soft and silky my skin feels! I love that!! I will share a secret with everyone, I definitely always put it on before I go do my speed walking exercises because it keeps me warm which helps me to stay moist when the weather is cold and makes me sweat extra under my thigh trimmers and belly band when it&#x27;s hot!! ONLY reason I didnt give it five stars is because I personally haven&#x27;t seen any improvements yet in skin discoloration but I feel that maybe it will happen after I have used it long enough, I just got it in April.</li>
    <li> i use this as a moisturizer after i take my hair down from sew ins or cornrows i leave a bunch in overnight with some plastic wrap and a head scarf (gets hot under there lol) and wash it out the next morning as usual and my hair feels so so soft. i have a full head of thick curly natural hair and this helps keep my strength. and i luv what it does to my feet. all u need is a lil of this coating ur feet and some socks over night and the next morning u will go sliding across the floor if ur barefooted (if u dont keep up with ur feet maintainence it will take more than one day!!! lol)  +++updated mar 2013+++  after some research I dont think this is shea butter but another type of african tree butter called african butter.. however its not a bad thing.. from what I have read and experienced this is more moisturizing than shea with the same antioxidant powers...</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous. I use it on my hands every night, as a nightly face moisturizer (I have dry skin), as a balm for cuts and scrapes, for dermatitis, for chapped lips. It is greasy, so you shouldn&#x27;t  touch anything that might stain (like fabrics) after you first put it on. I use it on my 4 year old every night in the winter, and I feel good knowing there aren&#x27;t any chemicals that might be seeping into his skin. A whole tub of it lasts quite a while, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to go bad just sitting under my sink. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Based on smell, texture, and results, I believe it is all natural product. It is kind of oily but the funny thing is that it doesn&#x27;t give me pimples or anything like other oily products. It leaves a smooth feel to my skin always. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I am 4 months pregnant, and I originally ordered this to help avoid stretch marks. Belly butters I was looking at with shea butter in them run about $30 for 8 oz. or less, so I figured for this price, I might as well go for the pure source.&lt;br /&gt;After reading through all the reviews though, I decided to give it a try on my face as well. I&#x27;ve always had acne-prone skin, but it&#x27;s been especially bad since I&#x27;ve been pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;The results have been absolutely astounding.&lt;br /&gt;All my life, I&#x27;ve been told I have extremely oily skin, so I&#x27;ve always focused on trying to dry it out. This product has totally turned things around for me. My bumps are all going away, the only blemishes I&#x27;m seeing are tiny and rare, and my skin is so soft that they&#x27;re very easily purged.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now, and while things aren&#x27;t totally clear yet, I&#x27;m definitely on the right track now. I&#x27;ve also started using Black Soap, and hoping that will help speed along the process.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very fast, so everything sticks to my face for a while after I put it on. I partially wonder if some of the new blemishes may have been caused by dirt/dust getting stuck in the cream, and thus, to my face. I could be using too much, but it&#x27;s so thick, it&#x27;s hard to spread a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;I guess that&#x27;s just a factor I&#x27;m still working on figuring out...&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I&#x27;m a believer for life in this stuff!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like complaining so I won&#x27;t, just truth.  Just ordered this and got it in record time along with the 2 other items I got.  But noticed upon opening the package, I found my Shea butters&#x27; container cracked on the bottom, probably dropped once.  Just made me worry that the product may dry out? Does it? Or leak a little when it gets warmer.  Anyway, the rim of it also had a little piece break off when taking the lid off.  Needless to say its not a big deal and I will be searching for a better something to hold it in to keep it fresh.  Which by the way the smell..is different, not quite what I expected.  Its a good smell though which make wonder because the Africans use it also as a cooking oil, could I use this stuff in replace of the Canola Oil I have in the kitchen? I emptied a smaller old Palmers cocoa butter jar that I will use as a refill container to the Shea, I will probably be adding pure essential oils as I use it. This is my first time ever buying straight Shea butter and when I run out of the yellow that I got, I will probably get the white next time just to try it.  I hope someone out there found this helpful.. Peace out</li>
    <li> Awesome customer service and the the product is top notch! Beware their are many Shea Butter scams on Amazon. I have fell for many shea butter suppliers that have given me bleached and botched butters that have left my skin damaged. These people know what they are doing and their butter works great on my skin.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase the 32oz tub from HalalEveryDay. The item was received quickly and my wife and I were happy to see that the quality is top notch. We use it as a daily moisturizer for everything from our faces, lips, hair, &amp; body. As a facial moisturizer, it does a great job and has not caused either of us breakouts. For my easily chapped lips, I still prefer Caramex but my wife (who doesn&#x27;t like the \\&quot;thick greasy feeling\\&quot;) much prefers the shea butter. My skin used to always dry and crack after every shower if I didn&#x27;t lotion up but since I&#x27;ve been using shea butter, I can often skip moisturizing when I&#x27;m in a rush. Thank you to the seller for providing a great product at a bargain price.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have buyed raw shea butter. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the rancid smell, so I call custumer service, wich was great, they gave some tips on how to add some different types of oils and after I did it was great!. I am relly happy with the product, it was shipped really fast (2 days) and the customer service was really helpfull! I&#x27;m going to use this product during my pregnancy to see if I can avoid some strech marks and keep my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I just received my order of African Filtered Creamy Shea Butter;it should read Chunky Shea Butter. I had to decide if I wanted to return it because I was misled by the picture and title, something akin to false advertising. I decided to keep it because it still is Shea Butter, it&#x27;s just going to take some work putting it on, having to break down the chunks and all. It will be creamy if you work to make it that way.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with cocoa butter, and coconut oil and made a lotion to use after showers when skin is moist. This is amazing to help with dry winter skin!</li>
    <li> If you have any concerns regarding your order of African Shea Butter. And always be sure to call and they are more than happy to keep you satisfied. Product is really nice also, very creamy. Packaged in plastic containers.Thank you Organic Herbal Essence, [...]!!!Satisfied:)And of course thanks to Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I suppose it depends on the tree that it came from...and the person that actually ground-down and created the Shea Butter, but the batch I received recently was just good, not great.   The first batch i received - in a smaller container from a friend - was much smoother. This batch tub that I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon is good, but it&#x27;s not as smooth. Hence my four stars instead of five.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy this product!  It is labeled with all the properties of real african shea butter, but it is hard and greasy.  After testing this product, it is made with petrolatum which is the same stuff vaseline is made with.  I could have bought a big tub of Vaseline for less than this crap.  Real shea butter absorbs quickly into the skin and is never hard or greasy.  It is equivalent to the same oil producing consistency of the body&#x27;s oil producing glands.</li>
    <li> I am changing my original review from 5 stars to 1 star.  After using this product for several months, my skin became incredibly dry, itchy and cracked. I have come to believe it is not real shea butter, and had to throw the whole thing away.  Not worth it: so don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> My partner has rosacea and I have terrible eczema (if we had kids they&#x27;d have awful skin for sure, LOL) and we discovered sort of by accident that shea butter was good for both. (I randomly got a tube of insanely expensive L&#x27;Occitane moisturizer that contained shea butter.) So we bought a giant container of raw shea butter. The other container finally was running out, after a couple of years, so I bought an even larger one, this one. The other container claimed to be exactly the same thing, though a different brand/seller. What it contained smelled the same as this, but was a creamy white. This container&#x27;s contents are a fairly bright yellow, and the texture is softer in the container. But apart from that, they seem to be the same, and are equally effective. I only mention the color because on my skin (white, pale) the yellow shows sometimes, and I was worried it might show even after the butter is absorbed. Fortunately this is not the case-- once it soaks in there&#x27;s no trace of the color.  I get the idea this stuff varies from batch to batch, so this feedback might not be that useful, but in case it makes anyone else nervous, I thought I&#x27;d mention it! Shea butter is great stuff; it&#x27;s greasy at first, to the point that I mostly apply it at night before going to bed (and often wear gloves to sleep in), but it soaks in entirely after a little while, depending on how dry your skin is. Great for brittle fingernails, scabby elbows, healing eczema flares (where the skin is discolored)... I even sometimes use it in my hair-- I rub it on my hands until it&#x27;s liquid, then rub my hands through the ends of my very long, brittle hair, then braid it up until I get a chance to wash it. Dual-purpose-- keeps the braids from getting frizzy, and once washed gently out, leaves my hair soft and lustrous. (Coconut oil is a little lighter and better for this purpose but when it&#x27;s real cold out I get out the big guns; shea butter doesn&#x27;t mess around.)  For the record I&#x27;m of North Europeanancestry and have stick-straight hair long enough to sit on, and terrible combination skin. Strangely enough the shea butter helps me avoid acne breakouts; I don&#x27;t know if it just keeps the oil glands on my face from over-acting, or if it&#x27;s something that the bacteria on my face can&#x27;t eat, or what, but it really does help, which is welcome since I&#x27;m at that age where I&#x27;m fighting both zits and wrinkles (NO FAIR!!!).</li>
    <li> I live in Texas, where winters are cold and summers are disgustingly hot.  Lots of showering in the summer and dry air in the winter leaves my skin itchy and dry all over, thus causing me to constantly seek out a great moisturizer.  Thank goodness I discovered this, because it is the best thing ever.  I have tried everything, from the high end brands to generic products, and nothing has worked as well as this does.  Bonus - You don&#x27;t end up with a crazy fragrance or a greasy body!  Huge perks for me in the summertime!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin which is not helped by anything until I started using shea butter. My skin is finally mostuirized, I use it all over. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using shea butter for years and have never seen such a great price.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the the quality of the shea butter is excellent.  It&#x27;s rich, creamy and goes on smooth.  I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> It is rich and creamy and good for the hair and skin!! You do have to rub it in good before applying it to the hair or skin.  Also make sure that you wipe off any extra water before applying it.</li>
    <li> Form the first time that my wife used this product, she claims that her skin has never felt better, she noticed a result from the very first try, she has used it on her face, now she&#x27;s going to use it all over her legs, her hands and her back.</li>
    <li> Was wonderful and good and service are also excellent and fast</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase! I paid $8 for 32 oz, and more to have it shipped, but it was well worth it! My 2 daughters and I have been using it both as well as mixed with other oils and it will sustain us for quite a while. Will be ordering for others soon.</li>
    <li> The price was right, but I found the texture too grainy/gritty as I am accustomed to another recipe. Once I rub in in, that grittiness dissolves, of course.</li>
    <li> This shea butter size is more than enough to make my body cream and creams for four other people. I also use it to make a hair dressing. The butter is not to hard so it is easy to measure out what you need. It has the light nut smell too  that is not bad or over powering. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The product works great it did what I needed it to and that was to help repair my damaged hair the only thing I did not like was the smell it was a little more than I could take.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on 12/3/09 and received it on 12/07/09. Excellent condition. I like this product a lot. It helps with wrinkles, pimples etc... Living in Miami, Fl the sun can do damage to the skin but this product helps even tone my skin. Try this product you won&#x27;t regret it and the price is GREAT!!!!!!!! it didn&#x27;t come in chunks but was smooth. The shea butter came in a container.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a moisturizer addict, and in time have learned to differentiate the over-priced and useless from the get-your-money&#x27;s-worth products.  This is definitely a product that lives up to the asking price.  Unlike 100% shea butter products at The Body Shop or L&#x27;Occitaine that are overtreated to the point that they lose a lot of their healing qualities, this shea butter is a more raw form.  Sure, it smells like cooking oil (which is strange) and it does take a while to completely absorb into your skin (much like coco butter or other rich moisturizers) but it is a lasting moisturizer that feels great.    Pros:  *Great moisturizer  *Rich and long-lasting  *At under $10 a pound (including shipping) this is one of the cheapest shea butters available    Cons:  *Smells like vegetable oil  *Comes in a Chinese take-out container  *Sort of lumpy texture, until it melts on your hand</li>
    <li> (Note: I&#x27;m writing this review on behalf of my wife.)    This product has worked \\&quot;perfectly\\&quot; (her words) as a moisturizing lotion.  She tried coconut oil before this, which was more oily and didn&#x27;t leave her skin feeling very moisturized once it absorbed in.  The shea butter is a bit harder to spread at first (it&#x27;s the consistency of very stiff peanut butter when you first scoop it out of the tub) but it&#x27;s not slick-oily and it leaves her skin feeling much more moisturized.    There is a slight nutty smell to it (I&#x27;d call it &#x27;neutral&#x27; - neither strongly pleasant or strongly unpleasant) that lingers after it&#x27;s spread on.  We haven&#x27;t seen any of the transfer of yellow color that other commenters have complained about; perhaps different batches are more or less liable to transfer color, or something.    All in all, definitely the thing to try if other lotions/moisturizers aren&#x27;t working for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and it&#x27;s going to last a long time. Discolorations are fading too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I now recommend it for everything: dry skin, acne, bug bites, and a hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must. Have. More.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to make homemade body butter, for my grandson, who has eczema. He loves the results, and it cost and is more effective than what the doctor recommend.</li>
    <li> The product was good but the container it came in was cracked at the base and some of the product seeped out.</li>
    <li> I originally got this product at a local festival for stretch marks and can&#x27;t be without it ever since I tried it. Provided pain relief on my feet that had been hurting me ever since I gained a lot of weight from my pregnancy. It had an anti-inflammatory effect, so unexpected because I meant to only use it on my stretch marks. Used a small dab of it on my color-treated hair and it makes it look radiant (need only small amount on tips or will look greasy). Finally, nothing was clearing up my baby&#x27;s diaper rash so I started using this product and OMG -- cleared up her rash. Since then, I use it all over her diaper area, stomach and back of knees to help keep her body moisturized to prevent rash and eczema flare ups (not even Desitin or A&amp;D ointment cleared up her rash!!!!) It&#x27;s a must have. My only issue is that the original purchase came in a chunky form where I had to smooth it out in my hands before applying it. The one I got on Amazon is already in a creamy form, but when I take some in my hands, is grainy and really wet and I have to smooth it out on my hands to get it back to a creamy form before I apply. Other than that, it still has the same great effect on her diaper area, rash free!!!! A mother&#x27;s dream come true.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer available(I literally have tried them ALL) and its pure, no chemicals no B.S. and exceptionally priced and excellent quality and a large quantity, will easily last you a year if one person!! Cant beat pure shea butter products...</li>
    <li> It smelled like gasoline. Hard to bear.</li>
    <li> Great service; great product. Took forever to write this review, but was totally pleased with everything. Shea butter is amazing for so many different uses; and my shipment came quickly. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this 2.5 years ago and it is still just like the day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was different two years ago but Amazon says this is the one I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in lipstick, deodorant and on my skin.  I have had it quite a while and am just now starting to use it for more than my hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will stain so use lightly or just use it with clothes that don&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter that i&#x27;ve purchase. It&#x27;s so smooth and creamy, just like i wanted it. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The shea butter is the base of the salve I make which has finally, after almost 23 yrs of marriage, healed my husband&#x27;s eczema. I put shea butter in jars with oure coconut oil, plantain herb, echinacea, lavender, comfrey, calendula, rosemary, echinacea....it steeps for 3 days. I then strain the herbs, add some beeswax, and pour it in tins. It healed him and keeps all my kids from getting dry. Heals cracked lips in an hour. Heals burns and abrasions. The shea butter is great alone too. Great for locked hair.</li>
    <li> It is great on toast, but don&#x27;t limit yourself to just toast. try it on flapjacks, pancakes, griddle cakes. Use your Imagination and let your heart soar!</li>
    <li> I love shea butter it really softens the skin. I use it daily and my skin is so soft and supple.</li>
    <li> in the winter my daughter has horrible exzcema and raw shea butter has been the only relief. its takes some time to work it in the skin when you first recieve the shea butter but after a couple of days its really easy. i even gave some to a co worker of mine that had extremely dry skin and had been suffering for 20+ years and this was the only product that worked. yea its a little oily but nothing major and if u want beautiful skin i think a little oil wouldnt hurt anyone</li>
    <li> I had heard Shea butter was very good for people with eczema, so I decided to try it. I have had eczema all my life and I have always had to use steroids in order to control it. For 4 weeks I&#x27;ve been using Shea butter and the results have been amazing, I haven&#x27;t used my skin medication at all in weeks. Every time I get a slight irritation I put Shea butter on and all gone. The first week I used it I saw no real change, my skin was moisturized but that&#x27;s the only difference I saw. But the second week, WOW!!! The change was amazing!!!! I had spot around my elbow that was constantly reoccurring even with the steroid medication, Shea butter made it disappear completely. I will definitely buy more it is no doubt, I love the stuff.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the seller</li>
    <li> Use it on my son&#x27;s hair... awesome product indeed... Will recommend to anyone else trying to maintain natural hair or moisturize skin</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, especially in Colorado winters. This Shea Butter is awesome for remedying it. I use it on my face and body (I even tried it on my hair as a deep conditioner...read more), it&#x27;s even great as a lip balm. My one complaint would be if you use it at night before bed, I often find myself in need of a shower in the morning because my hair will look greasy from shea butter contact throughout the night (maybe I use too much?). My face never looks greasy, it&#x27;s smooth, soft, and hydrated! This product also works great for after-sun care.It&#x27;s not my favorite as a deep conditioner; it took 2 days with several washing&#x27;s to get all the product out...maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right but I thought it was more trouble than it was worth for my hair.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I bought it to clear up some of my scars and it worked. The results are slow but you just have to apply it every night for a couple of months and you will see your scars, stretch marks and etc fade. The package also came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this product I was in NY.  So I was a little skeptical about purchasing from the internet.  However, the product was just as expected and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this shea butter on June 6, 2012 and I still have some left. It melts in my hand and gives my skin nice moisture! It also help clear up some dark spots! And this will also be good for the winter months! I will be ordering this again since I see it for a couple of dollars cheaper!</li>
    <li> My skin just does not absorb this like I thought it would. Really has not helped me at all. And it smells a little weird. I no longer think shea is the miracle ingredient that it has been touted to be. One thing i will say, though, is that is does not make me break out</li>
    <li> I guess I thought this was going to be a smoother product but it wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not whipped and its not hard like chunky blocks.</li>
    <li> Best price for shea butter, if you want it  pure and concentrated best way to buy it, you can always put in in other products to help with dryness, esp. on feet and hands and nails.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife and mother.  Initially it doesn&#x27;t smell good but once absorbed there is no smell.  It has a waxy/creamy texture until you warm it up by rubbing it in.  My wife and my mother really like using Shea butter and this is an economical alternative.  I buy them L&#x27;Occitane products but they are crazy expensive, this is a good alternative for feet, knees, elbows and stuff. They can use the \\&quot;good\\&quot; stuff on their faces and hands.</li>
    <li> My massage clients love this Shea butter! Not only does it work beautifully as the base for the massage medium, it is an excellent carrier for essential oils, people love it for their hair and some clients purchase it to use as a daily part of their skin care system. I will keep purchasing it for as long as this company offers it!</li>
    <li> Love, LOVE, LoVe... the product arrive before estimated time. I made a mixture of shea butter, coconut oil, and aloe vera for my hair... Scalp feels great and then combination is not to oily/heavy on my hair. Right now I have braids and I really need the extra oils. I melted Shea butter down to put in my Queen Helene lotion w/ coconut oil!  Queen Helene isn&#x27;t the greatest lotion by no means but it smells good and with coconut and shea butter it is much better now!! This is great so that you have it handy when you are in a hurry but I also apply it to my skin in its natural state. To melt it down I put the coconut oil and the shea butter in a owl and heat it for 10 seconds at a time until completely melted. The combination does wonders for my dry cracked feet and for my child who has éczema. Love that the effects last a long time and that I finally found something that really worth my money!</li>
    <li> For the value, you can&#x27;t beat getting this. I imagine this lasting for about 2 years. Would be nice if it was scented, but easy trade-off for the size of this.</li>
    <li> This is the best for dry skin &amp; very dry skin on feet. I use this daily on my feet during the summer.</li>
    <li> I have been using shea butter for my hair and body for 3 years now and I love this product. I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of it (real thick), so I pop it in the mircowave for a couple of seconds and then it is fabulous. Not a liquid or a hard solid...perfect. I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> This goes in perfect conjunction with Dr. Woods black soap!  I&#x27;ve used it as a deep hair conditioner - which leaves my hair soft and moisturized for DAYS! No need to use anything else! I&#x27;ve also used it when I suffered second degree burns on my fingers back in November and there is no scarring whatsover! My complexion looks more even to the point where I no longer use foundation, just powder! And if I am going to do some local shopping, I don&#x27;t even bother with makeup!!</li>
    <li> First of all, I feel that the title/description of the product is a bit of a misnomer.  This is 100% African shea butter, no additives.  It is *not* creamy.  When you first use it, it is rather gritty; however, it is very easy to make into a smooth, creamy consistency.  Put a bit into the palm of your hand.  Run under very warm (as hot as you can bear), and rub vigorously between your palms, occasionally running under more water.  In about 45 seconds, maybe more, you will have a smooth creamy consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also make your own creamy shea butter, for much less than buying it, and without the additives that manufacturers use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note:  Apply to wet skin or wet hair. The shea butter glides across the skin smoothly.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter has significantly diminished the lines around my eyes and across my forehead.  It also seems to have tightened my skin a bit, as it appears that I&#x27;ve had a mini-brow lift.  It has also evened out my skin tone, not just on my face, but on my arms and chest, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I epil my legs, and I have sensitive skin, so I used to have small red dots on my legs.  Now, after I use the epilator, I vigorously rub shea butter on my legs.  No more red dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recently developed an extremely itchy rash.  The rash was so bad, that I was losing significant amounts of sleep.  For me, insomnia can be productive, but not when I&#x27;m being tortured by itchiness, I can&#x27;t focus on anything productive.  My doctor prescribed an ointment.  *yawn*  It did NOTHING.  She prescribed another ointment.  Nothing, again.  The shea butter greatly diminished the itchiness.  However, I discovered that applying apple cider vinegar to the affected area cures the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you chemically treat your hair, i.e., perming, coloring, straightening, applying the shea butter to the ends, after you have creamed it, helps greatly with dry ends - do not use a lot.  Or, you can apply it liberally to the ends of wet hair as a moisturizing treatment. After a couple of hours, shampoo hair normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, apply to wet skin and especially to wet hair.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time purchasing shea butter from the this company. This time the color is sort of white instead of yellow and  was in a plastic bag inside a large white pail with a handle.  I really don&#x27;t like the consistency of the product either.  I am seriously thinking about not using this company again.  I will try the product to see how I like it but I&#x27;m about 96% sure this will be the last time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve begun making my own moisturizers and lip balms, and shea butter is the main ingredient I use.  I like the size of this one, because it will last and I can dip into it whenever I&#x27;m ready to make a new batch.  I appreciate that it comes in a resealable container for easy storage.  The product itself is smooth and buttery.  I love the smokey scent.  This stuff leaves my skin, hair, face, and lips feeling supple.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> The wrapping is too poor to satisfy.  It was packed in a disposable container with a very heavy amount. If the container can be upgraded.  The stuff is very rough and raw in look, which seems like without any refined or modified process in filtering the impurities.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this.  She uses it during previous and current pregnancy and no stretch marks at all.  She uses is twice a day (morning and night) and it works.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this item.  I use it for my hair but also for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with another oil, like coconut oil, to make it easier to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a slight case of eczema and this product really helped alot.  It&#x27;s even better than prescriptions provided by my doctor.  It took a few weeks but I noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it, even if you only use it at night on your skin.  It is initially greasy, but it quickly absorbs.</li>
    <li> i got white shea butter not the gold shown in the picture, which makes me a little mad spent so much money ON 2lbs of shea butter that i thought was the gold shown in the picture. So didnt get what i ordered since picture is misleading! so if you looking for the gold shea butter dont bother with this add.</li>
    <li> After purchasing shea butter from several vendors over the past few years, I can say that this is the best product at the best price so far.  It arrived creamy and wonderful, but the Arizona sun had baked it, and shea butter that has melted and then hardened again can be grainy.  Still, you can rub it on and the little clumps disappear quickly.  I had a near-fatal allergic reaction than burns your skin almost as if you&#x27;d been in a fire, and nothing was helping my skin heal as well as I wished--even my scalp was involved. My doctors recommended several expensive creams, and some recommended petroleum jelly.  I tried them all, and then returned to shea butter, my skin cream of choice, from this company.  Now, after a few weeks, my skin is getting much better, much faster.  I may mix it with olive oil or another oil just to make it easier to apply, but that&#x27;s not really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can use petroleum jelly, but you won&#x27;t get the sunscreen protection, or the vitamin E that shea butter offers, among other benefits.  I recommend anyone with skin or scalp issues to use shea butter, especially this shea butter, and see if it helps you as much as it has me and some others who&#x27;ve posted here.  It&#x27;s a natural and gentle remedy that has been used for centuries.</li>
    <li> Good price my wife and use everyday.</li>
    <li> I received these containers broken or exploded and the box was oily. The product is now drier than it should be. Not sure if I am going to order again.</li>
    <li> I believe the Product Features, but this product has a nutty-smokey aroma.&lt;br /&gt;It has a smell, like when you cook your bacon and you smell the rest of the fat! :((&lt;br /&gt;it melts in your hand like an oil was added to it.It does not smell like nuts to me.&lt;br /&gt;It is still on my skin 3 hours after I tried to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is mid-dry, and after I apply my macadamian cream, my skin sucks it into itself&lt;br /&gt;so deep, that I cant feel any cream on my skin 2 minutes later.</li>
    <li> When I bought the 16 oz one I was more satisfied because it was a fresh product.  This time the quality was not as good.  The smaller size smelt very tasty, this 32oz one was a bit stinky so I think it was an older product.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry skin.  It can be used on the hair as a conditioner. Try it &amp; you will like it.</li>
    <li> I thought the product was going to be better than it was. It was clumpy although I brought the filtered creamy shea butter. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and after using a brand named cream that contained Shea butter, and researching the origin and uses, I though why not try the real stuff? This was our 1 st purchase of shea butter so unfortunately I cannot compare it to other unrefined Shea products. What I can tell you is that we really love it! It has a thicker texture than butter before you use it, but as you begun to spread it your body heat will soften it to a buttery, oily substance. We usually apply it before bedtime. In the morning I don&#x27;t have that gooey, oily feeling that I do with some products. My daughter likes it because, even if she&#x27;s scraped her skin a little raw, it goes on without hurting...probably because it doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial scents or perfumes. Which leads me to to the only  negative remark I could make is that it doesn&#x27;t have an appealing scent to some people. I do not mind it but husband doesn&#x27;t care for it. There are &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; you can make with the shea, so I&#x27;m sure you could add something to make it smell yummier. Anyway, I enjoy this product and found it to be the best value that I found online and will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Noticed change in skin really quickly. Best Shea butter I have ever used in my whole entire life. GO and GET IT</li>
    <li> Very strong odour. Not the mild nutty scent as described. I made lip balm and used two essential oils, lemon and mandarins and the scent did not come through due to the odour of the Shea butter. The lip balm is soft to the lips, but I am not completely satisfied with results.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin rejuvenator. Suprisingly, I also find it works well with muscle pain. I use it often and have gotten my friends to love it too.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my hair to do braid outs and twist outs. But I came to realize its EXTREMELY too heavy for my natural hair. Instead I use it after I get out of the shower to put on my whole body. For body use it keeps my skin moisturized and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> The Shea butter is smooth not clumped like other brands. It has very little smell. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love Shea butter, but found it too pricey.  Was SO happy to find this.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it&#x27;s all natural, and unscented, except the natural nutty scent (it comes from a nut afterall) is great.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to moisturize my extremely dry Colorado skin.&lt;br /&gt;A word about Shea butter...you need to WARM it between your palms to melt it, then rub it in wherever you want.&lt;br /&gt;The BEST reason to use this is it LASTS!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for abrasions and burns, as well as rashes.  I use it to make my own lotion bars.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made for my body. Works better than any body butter I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I just got my item.. hope this works..5 star cause it smelled like the product that my mom usually apply for my scars when I was younger. and that product actually healed the scar on my face with the help of my mom of course in applying religiously. hope this will do the same.. I&#x27;ll try to update this review few days/weeks from now.. ^_^</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have been using it now for 2 weeks and it leaves my skin feeling super soft. I would def. recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I was sad when I opened the shipping box and found a mess.  The customer service people were quick and helpful.  Most of the product was still in the container, so they shipped me a small container to replace what leaked out during shipping.  I used the African butter to make a lye soap recipe and the soap turned out nicely.  I also made a lotion using it and am pleased.  The texture wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I anticipated, but it became smooth when heat was applied to it for the bath recipes and so far the soap and lotion have remained smooth in their texture.</li>
    <li> Purchased for making my own whipped lotion. Also use it straight out of the container and put into a repurposed small cosmetic container for travel. With a bit of rubbing melts into skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. A few drops of lavender essential oil masks the odor making it even more pleasant to use. My husband and son don&#x27;t mind the natural smell either, but I did.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it was the same as I&#x27;d gotten when I was in New Orleans earlier in the year.  Unfortunately, it is not the same.  This product absorbs into the skin quickly but it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave the skin feeling soft.  This is unlike the product I&#x27;d previously purchased.  I don&#x27;t feel that I can recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for your skin, nails, and hair. The filtered version is extremely easy to manage and apply and has all the same benefits of unfiltered shea butter. A little goes a long way too!</li>
    <li> I bout this product to use for all diffrent types of scars on my body.  It did nothing!  I wouldnt buy again.</li>
    <li> 100% what it said it was!</li>
    <li> Was nervous to order this after reading some questionable reviews regarding rancid orders, etc. I had no problems. My order came quickly, well packaged, and as expected. The shea butter has been a great skin treatment method! Hoping to make some soaps or creams using my giant container!</li>
    <li> Packing was terrible. Container was completely unacceptable. Was not able to use the product so it had to be thrown away.</li>
    <li> As described. Fast ship. Would use again.</li>
    <li> Everything is okay&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I tested it out and my skin seems to like it. It has that nutty smell that everyone says is neccessary for it to be legit. But it&#x27;s a pale yellow color and everyone says that actual shea butter is a beige or off-white.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure but regardless, I like the product. It does what it supposed to do. Since it is a fat, if you use too much at once, it&#x27;ll feel a bit greasy but the skin absorbs it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I like it.</li>
    <li> I love my shea butter!! I use it for my hair and skin. I use it for my grand girls too. They love to rub it all over themselves.I will purchase it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> The ONLY reason why I&#x27;m giving a 3 is beacuse my container was broken badly when I received it. Because of that I had to send it back. :(&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like awesome shea butter nonetheless</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by how it looks.  Just rub a small amount on your skin and it soaks right in.  It even stays after washing!  I had burned my hand and was still able to use this without any irritation.  It&#x27;s not completely healed yet, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be leaving a scar!</li>
    <li> I bought African Shea Butter for the first time about a year ago.  I used it sporatically, but about 6 months ago I began using it regularly on my nails (4 or 5 times a day after I washed my hands.)  I am 69 and my nails had become very dry and ridged and as a result they split and broke.  I also rubbed it into my cuticles, which have always been dry, and I have a terrible habit of picking at them.  After a couple of months of of this intensive use my nails have become suppler, and they are not breaking.  The ridges are still there but the nail seldom splits. And, much to my amazement, my cuticles are softer and no longer problematic.  I even pick at them less, because they are no longer so \\&quot;pickable.\\&quot;  I also rub shea butter on my toenails and they are way less dry and brittle.  This is miracle stuff!</li>
    <li> It left clumps in my hair and yellow stuff. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this item again, didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> Love it, works well for my hair. This is the only shea butter that I purchase, ships fast. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> The product worked ok for hair products but it had a strange \\&quot;off\\&quot; smell (not nutty). I melted it down and strained it and that helped with impurities (and it didn&#x27;t seem filtered at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought it, it was cheaper than other products on Amazon...my fault...sometimes you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other products, including shea butter, sold by Halaal Everyday, that are better.  I&#x27;ve had good luck with the products Halaal Everyday sells (especially their Shea Oil which is fabulous). This one was not up to the standard of the other products they sell. Check out the Halaal Everyday storefront for other shea products, skip this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It does not take much, and it is so thick and creamy.  So many people are talking about the miracle qualities of Shea Butter.  I use it on my face, hair and body.  It is great for a natural Sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
