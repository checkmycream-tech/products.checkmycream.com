      <li>I am 19 weeks pregnant</li>
      <li>Hands actually felt just like she said and we both liked it.</li>
      <li>This feels nice on my hands, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily heal.  </li>
      <li>The responses from my friends have been very positive.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting to see both sides stay pretty much the same and be able to toss the super strong steroid creams out the window.</li>
      <li>The fact that I can use it for full face moisturizer (face, lip, around eyes) and whole body if needed during a trip, it very convenient.  </li>
      <li>but I love it and have re-ordered several times.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cream absorbs in to the skin without any oily residue.  The fragrance always smells clean and refreshing.  love using this product.  Packaging was good and shipping great.</li>
    <li> Overpriced!!! It&#x27;s a nice cream and probably does wonders if you have exzema - which I don&#x27;t have.  Other than that it does not get rid of scars, marks, etc. I&#x27;m certain there are more affordable brands that will get the job done.</li>
    <li> I like the product because it is all natural, and is not greasy on my skin. It moisturizes as it states and I love the fact that it is aloe.  Highly recommend it.  I use it all over!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever tried.  I haven&#x27;t bought another brand since 2005.  I have dry hands.  And other lotions go on so greasy it takes either too much to cover my ashy hands or it takes too long for those other lotions to absorb into my skin.  Infinite aloe works instantly, absorbing directly into my skin.  I tell people \\&quot;it only takes a little.\\&quot; They don&#x27;t believe it, but they are amazed.  Other thing I found out.  It won&#x27;t freeze.  I leave it in my car in the winter and I can use it on demand without thawing it out like the other brands.  And it doesn&#x27;t turn to liquid in the summer.  This stuff is amazing.  I&#x27;m African American and my skin gets dry but not ashy anymore bc of this miracle skin cream.</li>
    <li> Very good smooth on skin.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this moisturizer! Everyone I have gotten to try this absolutely loves it.  I read about all the things this stuff could do so I bought it on a whim. I have extremely oily skin in my Tzones, vey dry on my cheeks, am prone to breakouts, and my skin is extremely sensitive.  I am 30 and had never found anything that I was happy with to use on my face, until I found this.  It isn&#x27;t oily, it balances out my skin and makes my skin so soft! I also have extremely brittle nails and it helps that too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother in law has extremely dry skin on her hands, she also could not find a facial moisturizer.  I gave her a container for Christmas one year, because I loved it so much.  She uses it every day religiously now. She let her father try it because he had extremely dry elbows and nothing else worked. Now he uses it regularly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I had a friend that was looking for a new facial moisturizer.  I convinced her to try it finally, she went ahead and got a bunch of it because her grandma was looking for something as well.  She bought it and they split it.  Much to their amazement it did everything they wanted and nothing they didn&#x27;t. Now they are users for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know people look at the price and think it&#x27;s expensive.  Honestly it&#x27;s not!  One jar lasts me about 11 months.  I bought four large jars, with four small ones, last year.  I gave one to my mother in law, have used one on myself, just opens a new jar and still have an entire jar left.  Think about it.... Each jar lasts from 6 to 12 months. What other product can you say does all this for the price??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I highly recommend you give it a try! You are worth it!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product. Makes my skin feel so great.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product has really impressed me.  I picked it up on a whim when it was on demo at convention I attended.  I half expected to find out I had just wasted $150.  I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised to report that it&#x27;s performing as advertised and beyond my expectations.  I have very dry skin all over with an extremely oily t-zone and mild acne problem on my face.  The t-zone oiliness and acne have been a problem for the last year (middle age hormone changes I think) and the dry skin has been a struggle since I can remember.  I started using Infinite Aloe on my face and I&#x27;m amazed. No more oil slick in the t-zone and yet no dry flaking skin either.  As another reviewer noted - it has balanced me out.  Also my acne is clearing up without all the irritation and drying caused by typical cleansers and treatments.  Incredible.  I&#x27;m amazed.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but I was at the point of heading to the dermatologist for professional help - that would have cost a lot more.  My skin feels great and Infinite Aloe serves as a great base for applying my makeup - flawless finish and it last for hours and hours without becoming shiny.</li>
    <li> This is just another light weight skin lotion and does not meet my expectations.  Way overprices.</li>
    <li> It is not greasy, a little goes a long way, it is absorbed but does not clog pores.  It feels wonderful and I believe it keeps rosacea at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought it in Las Vegas and was a little skeptical but I love it and have re-ordered several times.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and has been using it for a couple of years now.</li>
    <li> As a physician, I wash my hands at least 50 times per day. Add my after-work interests of horses, and my hands take a beating.  They&#x27;re so rough that they bleed at times. And I get the painful cracks on my fingers. I&#x27;ve slathered with all kinds of lotions for years, but without constant attention, my hands suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should put the above paragraph mostly in past tense.  I bought the Infinite Aloe Skin Care Cream at a horse expo a couple weeks ago. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be any better than my drawerful of creams.  But I was amazed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a day or two, my hands were smoother. Within a week, they&#x27;re \\&quot;normal.\\&quot;  It takes a tiny bit of lotion. It rubs in well, almost seeming like I didn&#x27;t apply anything. But my hads are smooth, no cracks. MUCH better! The lotion does not wash off like most others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the cream literally from head to toe -- well actually \\&quot;on head and toe.\\&quot;  My feet have always been very dry, to the point they can rip the heels of my socks. I lotion, file, and buff them.  Well, actually I DID do those things.  This lotion is amazing!  With just a little each night, my feet are pretty normal. No more embarrassing thick heels. No more scratching my husband with my foot callouses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;ve used it on my face. My favorite part is that it gets into the skin well, so there&#x27;s no oiliness on the surface.  I&#x27;ve had problems with my mascara wearing off through the day, but with this lotion, I&#x27;ve had no problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already given away a couple of the travel size containers. The responses from my friends have been very positive.  Yes, I highly recommend this cream!</li>
    <li> Alleviates my psoriasis issue.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003VS8U8M Infinite Aloe Skin Care Cream, Original Scent, 8oz. Jar ** (Plus a Bonus 0.5 oz InfiniteAloe Travel Jar) **]]    This product has improved my skin in very little time. My skin appears younger. I applied it to a split fingernail and it has healed it when nothing else would work. Goes deep into the skin and it is not greasy. You can wear it under makeup. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> really good product not greasy and absorbs well</li>
    <li> The best skin cream ever.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before several years ago and ran out of it for a year or so and NOTHING compares. I tried all kinds of lotions and creams and was so desperate to go back I could not wait for the Women&#x27;s Expo this year to purchase. The truth is…my skin is hydrated and less wrinkled and no chaffed hands!! I use it on my face, hands and it feels so wonderful. I will never go without it again!!</li>
    <li> I am 76 years and this has really made my skin look good helps mellow out the age spots on my arms and face</li>
    <li> Everybody knows the benefits of using aloe Vera on our skin, plus the great fragrance of this line of cream makes it ideal for the value. Great product overall.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a Farmers Market 3 years ago and have not used anything since on my face. I am 64 and I love how this lotion makes my skin feel. I put it on in the morning and do not need anything else all day long. I buy it from this company because they are much cheaper than anyone else. I have used many lace creams, but this is the best. My skin is very soft and stays that way now.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used for many years.</li>
    <li> I found this lotion in at the Aladdin (now called Planet Hollywood or PH) in Las Vegas about 5 years ago. My daughter had an extreme case of excema and tried several OTC and prescription creme and lotions and nothing worked so when I saw this product in a kiosk in Vegas I bought it. I had to buy 4 tubs which wasn&#x27;t cheap but the guy who sold it to me said if it didn&#x27;t work that I could return it and get a full refund so I had nothing to lose. My daughter&#x27;s excema was gone in a month. I would rub it on the affected areas twice a day and it worked! I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of it so the tubs lasted about a year. Great product!</li>
    <li> I found this product at a show in Las Vegas this year - and immediately knew it was the right product for me! It smells great, is light (NOT greasy), is made out of a holistic botanical and makes my skin feel very soft. It has especially helped on my heels - to keep my feet looking respectable while wearing sandals. I appreciate the premise behind the product - especially no testing on animals. My experience with Customer Service, Stephanie in particular, has been outstanding! All around, I feel I received great value for the product and the warranty standing behind it gives me a good feeling. I am very happy with my purchasing decision and have shared this knowledge/experience with my friends.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  I use as a facial moisturizer every night before bed, I would use it in the morning too but it doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen in it.  It really does everything it claims to and more... I must admit I was a bit skeptical when I first bought this product at Sam&#x27;s Club but I have been nothing but pleased with its results.  I find that my skin looks healthier, the tone is more even and I am not kidding, I really feel like the fine lines in my face have diminished. I also have found that this product really does have great healing properties, I have used it on everything-including as a chamois cream after cycling! I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all lies. So disappointed. I have dry sensitive skin and I have to reapply the creme several times before I feel that my skin is moisturized. It says it can use on eczema, it doesn&#x27;t work on my eczema. It says it works on sunburn, it doesn&#x27;t work on my sunburn.</li>
    <li> I was conned into trying this lotion a few years back by a salesperson at a Las Vegas kiosk, and I have been using it ever since.  I had it shipped to me in Afghanistan when I ran out.  It feels SO good on my skin, and is light and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> wonderful... light scent, very soothing.  I give it away as gifts, and they are well appreicated</li>
    <li> I like this skin cream for uses other than what I purchased it for.  I have very dry hands. The skin around my nails cracks open, bleeds and can be very painful. This feels nice on my hands, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily heal.  I sometimes use this on my face at night and on my neck, arms and legs during the day. I sometimes use it as hand cream. it cost more than I would normally pay, however, it does feel wonderful, has a pleasant scent and does soften your skin!</li>
    <li> I bought this yesterday at a local Quilt Show.  So far so awesome!!!! My hands are very dry and just having used this twice so far I can tell a major difference.  My hands feel hydrated.  It lasted all day thru several hand washings.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how well it works on my elbows and feet.  Will post an updated review after a month or so of use.</li>
    <li> I bought some of this lotion at a trade show in Las Vegas, and almost immediately had buyer&#x27;s remorse because I paid so much for &amp;#34;lotion.&amp;#34;  Then I got it home and started using it and LOVE it.  Lightly scented, but not overpowering at all.  Best thing I&#x27;ve used on my feet, nice on sunburn, as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a pretty severe rosacea flare up for quite some time now and the topical medication isn&#x27;t helping at all.  I&#x27;m actually using the unscented version, I received a sample at a kiosk in Sam&#x27;s club last week.  Rosacea was listed on the poster claiming this would remedy it.  Well, a few days into using it I realized that it wasn&#x27;t enough moisture  just once a day but using it as needed helps.  And I&#x27;m sure my severe rosacea was partly to blame.  I noticed that part way through the day my cheeks would feel dry and tingly.  Then I notice that the pustules started drying out and flaking away and the redness was actually fading a little and I got optimistic.  But now at about a week of using it, the redness is flaring brighter and I&#x27;m also getting white head pimples in the rosacea area.  I&#x27;m not going to quit using it just yet because I\\&quot;m still optimistic (there is no quick remedy for rosacea) so anyone with rosacea, do proceed with caution.  I&#x27;m REALLY hoping I will again see the results I saw in the first few days.  I am 19 weeks pregnant and I&#x27;m sure that is also playing a huge part in how my skin is behaving.  My skin is much dryer after about the 15th week of pregnancy, no more oily hair or t-zone and we are heading into winter so the dryer colder air is also playing a big part.  I&#x27;ll post updates as I go.  Whether this helps people with rosacea or it doesn&#x27;t, I feel it&#x27;s important to share.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found. Just wish it was less expensive</li>
    <li> I tried the cream for 1 day and the niacin in this cream I think burned my skin.  Next day, I had small patches of raw skin exposed underneath my arm and my face and neck became patchy red and painful like a bad sunburn. I had high hopes for this cream. Sadly, it failed to help my dry sensitive skin.  I also tried their Anti-Aging Formula and that too irritated my skin.  I think this cream is too hyped up plus I do not like their toxic preservative, phenoxyethanol in the cream. I have tried this cream under a different name over 10 years ago as Corium 21. Now I remember why I did not like it. It irritated my skin just like this one.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Awesome seller</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use on my skin.  It moisturizes, restores elasticity, soothes irritations.  It is expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I tried this before and my family and friends love it too!!!  It is less irritating and leads to less blemishes than other moisturizers for sensitive skin I have tried.  Price per cost ratio for use as face moisturizer is lower when compared to sensitive skin care line product.  I especially love the convenient travel size small containers, good for carrying in handbag and to have at work, or to give away for someone who likes it or wants to try it.  The fact that I can use it for full face moisturizer (face, lip, around eyes) and whole body if needed during a trip, it very convenient.  Less carrying, less containers.  Does this count as environmental friendly option?</li>
    <li> My wife purchased several jars of this product.  After two weeks she developed a bad rash.  My strong advice is to only order a small jar until you know if there will be a skin reaction.  And avoid impulse purchases.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for my husband, but opened a jar for myself and love it.  It has helped the &amp;#34;crepey&amp;#34; sking on my arms and hands and has improved my skin overall. Use it daily!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to everyone. Makes my skin feel awesome no greasy residue. I love this lotion.. has even been lightening my stretch marks from having a baby. Also helps on burns. LOVE LOVE LOVE it would totally recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Awesome cream.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and even works excellent on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product so excited I found on Amazon</li>
    <li> This is some very moistureizing cream. I just love it.</li>
    <li> Amazing, the skin feel more clean and soft, I´ve tried a lot of more creams and this one is the best!</li>
    <li> love the product really works for me not as greasy as most on the market however hated paying the price for customs into the country will not be fooled again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product...pricey but worth it for your skin.  I went through 4 jars (it took a while) and use it every day on my face.  I can see the difference, especially in winter.  I used to have really dry skin and this has helped a great deal.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Excellent skin care product!</li>
    <li> I own a jar of Infinite Aloe almost by accident... We were accosted by one of those sales people from a kiosk in the mall and my mother in law was with me. She has struggled with foot fungus for ages so she decided to buy a jar and the incentive of the day was a freebie... so she gave it to me for my husband (her son) who also has foot fungus... He has never used it and it has been hiding in my bathroom cabinet for ages....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has HORRIBLY dry skin and we have tried EVERYTHING to sooth it over the years. This year, it has turned into the worst case of Eczema the doctors have seen (I personally think there is more to it than eczema, but three different doctors have prescribed heavy moisturizer and a steroid cream, and left it at that). Since we have been dealing with this in such an extreme case, and the doctors&#x27; recommendations have not been helping at all, we decided to do a test... one arm gets doctors orders, the other arm gets this stuff from under the sink... lets find out if the Rx is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we started this test, I expected that the side with infinite aloe would be the control side... not get better, and hopefully not get too much worse. I was expecting to see both sides stay pretty much the same and be able to toss the super strong steroid creams out the window. I was SOOO WRONG!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The arm that has been treated with steroid cream and 2% hydracortizone and coconut oil several times a day (doctors orders), is indeed improving... it is still very irritated, but manageable. If we continue to see the same rate of improvement, I expect it to be another month or so before the scabs are gone and outbreaks are under control (it has been two weeks). Still very rough skin and when not slathered in oil, very dry, but healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The arm that has been the &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; arm, treated only with infinite aloe, is COMPLETELY HEALED!!!! There is no sign of scabbing, no rough areas, no outbreak spots..... nothing but pigment lightening (same as the other arm) where the problem areas were!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am AMAZED at this stuff!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty spendy in my opinion and I would never have spent on it what my mother in law did, but I just placed an order for 4 jars from Amazon because I cannot imagine ever being without it!!!igment lightening (same as the other arm) where the problem areas were!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am AMAZED at this stuff!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty spendy in my opinion and I would never have spent on it what my mother in law did, but I just placed an order for 4 jars from Amazon because I cannot imagine ever being without it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using Infinite Aloe for many years. It is the best for dry winter skin and it smells heavenly. My family loves it.</li>
    <li> Have always used this and have always been satisfied</li>
    <li> This is the first lotion/cream that I found that really works.  I can tell when I forget to use it because my cuticles will get dry and bother me.  My skin remains soft and it helps heal any dryness and skin cracks after working in the yard and house.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for over a decade.  Wonderful results, not greasy or oily on the body.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and thought that this would alleviate the problem. It did not. I am sorry I bought so much of it.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day mostly on my feet  I like it for other part of my body but not as much as my feet.  I know it&amp;#34;s good for any part of my body but it also is expensive and I use it where I getr the most good.  I would recommend it to all who want a good product for any part of their body.  I love it</li>
    <li> I have used Infinite Aloe Skin Cream for several years, and have always been satisfied with the results. My husband and daughter also use it and ask for it when we run out! We purchase a package once a year, which is enough for the three of us and a couple of trial size bottles for friends too. It only takes a small amount to keep skin soft. It feels very creamy when applying yet absorbs well. We prefer the original scent, but there are other choices for those who wish to try them.  We will continue to purchase this product for personal use.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am a 65 year old guy (straight one too) and I don&#x27;t usually use this kind of stuff or any creams. Don&#x27;t really like the smells and greasy feelings. Ran into this item at a Yankee Dental Conference in Boston a couple of years ago. The sales lady enticed my associate and myself over and put some of this stuff on both our dry hands. Said it had no smell, was not greasy and that there were over 300 types of Aloe which I found interesting. Hands actually felt just like she said and we both liked it. Only thing that turned us off was the price. My wife would spend this but I am too cheap. My buddy and I decided to to split the show special which we did. So far I have reordered 3 times. Found that it really helped to reduce the bumps on my hands that come out when exposed to sun while driving my convertible all the time and when out in my boat. Also, found it works on other skin things of which I have no idea what they are. Bumps here and there go away shortly after I put the stuff on. My associate is also very pleased with it. To bad its kinda pricy but I don&#x27;t let that bother me anymore. You cannot go wrong. The more you buy the cheaper it is. I was told it has a 3 year shelf life.</li>
    <li> I use this cream everyday because it relieves many skin issues.  The texture an aroma are very soothing.  Buying multiple jars is a money saver.</li>
