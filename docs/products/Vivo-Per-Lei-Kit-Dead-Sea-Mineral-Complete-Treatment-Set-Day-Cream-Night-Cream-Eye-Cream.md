<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everything I ordered came in the correct packaging and I was very impressed with it. The VIVO PER LEI exfoliation, night, face &amp; eye creams are the only products that don&#x27;t break me out or cause pimples on my face . Thank you for selling these products!</li>
    <li> I have used many of the Vivo Per Lei products for several years. I really like the moisturizer (day and night) and the peel. However, I have always used the Premier dead sea eye cream. I decided to buy the Vivo Per Lei Kit because I could not find the eye cream I usually use and I can always use  the moisturizer. It was a mistake that I won&#x27;t make again. You have to keep the Vivo Per Lei eye cream bottle upsite down or it won&#x27;t come out when you pump. Also I have more wrinkles under my eyes now. My Premier eye cream worked much better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is original product. Feels like another product was bottled in place of the original. I have used this product that I had bought in the mall for 4 time the cost and it left the skin luminous, soft, and young. This product does not.</li>
    <li> The best for skin care!</li>
    <li> Works very nicely on my 75 year old face.</li>
    <li> Had to return because I couldn&#x27;t breathe from the fragrance.  Way too strong, the only thing to do was to keep the top off the jar to let it dissipate.</li>
    <li> love it so much.... my skin look more beautiful and smooth</li>
    <li> i tried this upon a friend&#x27;s request and have been very pleased  not greasy leaves your skin feeling wonderful i also bought a set for my mom she loves it</li>
    <li> Really makes your skin feel refreshed and will last all day.  My husband and I will use this for each others feet, but good for all over body use as well...just leaving your skin so soft and silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Delivered before expected date and exactly what was written in description.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for aging, but it feels wonderful on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT BUY! In the malls the price will shock you for the exact same products. Really like the wait feels and makes my skin feel. Came in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> Same quality as mall kiosk would sell for 1/4 of the price. I compared even the packaging and it has the same identical sparkle on the box that reflects at an angle. It has the cloth lining inside and the labels are identical, showed made in japan. The smell and the consistency were also the same. Most importantly, it also feels the same on the skin. I would buy again online.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  same as what i&#x27;d bought at the mall kiosk for a much better price. Came very fast as well.</li>
    <li> Very nice! I&#x27;m very impressed with all these creams - day, night, and eye.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.  I love the way that it makes my face feel after using it.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, found the same products in the mall kiosk for triple the price. I will stock up on this</li>
    <li> I read some good reviews about these products so I decided to try something new and give them a try. The eye cream states 1 fl oz but when I opened it the jar is less than half full. Will be returning. Have not tried the product so this review is only based on the amount (or lack there of) not how it works</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is the same as in malls that I. Have bought in past.  Recommend it</li>
    <li> My order came earlier than expected date.  Very happy about that.  I love this product!  It  makes my skin feel so much better.  I haven&#x27;t had a day of dryness or tight feeling since I began using it. Other products I have used haven&#x27;t lasted the whole day. This will be a regular purchase for me.  I hope to try the body cream soon</li>
    <li> I love all Vivo per Lei product for year I fighter with my acne, visit so many dermatologist, esthetics, used infinity the creams and treatments and always was frustrated because my acne never improvement.
