      <li>What more can I say.</li>
      <li>After 36 years of NO fragrance wearing - migraines - I find I am once again able to wear them.</li>
      <li>Amazon also had the better price and, taa-daa, free shipping with Prime.</li>
      <li>Opium is too strong for that.</li>
      <li>- it is STRONG.</li>
      <li>I would not put it on skin that isn&#x27;t covered with clothing because I think it would be too strong.</li>
      <li>This is such a beautiful, floral scent.  </li>

      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>Fantastic, CLEAN fragrance.</li>
      <li>This fragrance has a clean scent and it lasts ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Found a larger size with a better price than on the Estee Lauder website right here on Amazon, now I can have my scent all to myself, as much as I want, for a great price.</li>
      <li>scent is clean, fresh, and can be light if you don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
      <li>The scent is a clean, fresh, light flowery scent that isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
      <li>(I also use Hermes Caleche and Yves Saint Laurent Opium, both of which are much stronger, better for evening scent.</li>
      <li>This is a timeless fragrance that makes you feel fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>I love to wear it day and night because it is suttle and soft, clean.</li>
      <li>THanks, A+++ Amazoner!!</li>
      <li>I smell like fresh soap.  </li>
      <li>I laways liked white linen but just could not find it.  </li>
      <li>I really like the clean smell.</li>
      <li>She has used a number of the famous perfumes and still does, but when her bottle of this gets low, she is quick to let me know.  </li>
      <li>Smells great as usual</li>
      <li>I started wearing this fragrance a long time ago, I stopped wearing it because all of my friends liked the way it smelled on me</li>
      <li>Scents and fragrances are very personal, so I rate White Linen 5 stars because it is exactly the fragrance that makes the woman I bought it for exuberantly happy.  </li>
      <li>The delivery was very fast and my wife loves this perfume.</li>
      <li>White Linen is my favorite cologne.  </li>
      <li>I always love me some White Linen perfume.</li>
      <li>I have used my Estee Lauter White Linen for many years.</li>
      <li>The one thing I can brag about is the fact that Amazon has saved me many dollars not only in the price of the item, but the time and effort it would take to go to the store to purchase.</li>
      <li>I love White Linen.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance and now that Estee Lauder has put out Pure White Linen,</li>
      <li>This is her favorite perfume and has been for a long time.  </li>
      <li>The item was brand new, delivered quickly and ready for use as a Christmas gift.</li>
      <li>It has such a clean and crisp smell to it.  </li>
      <li>The perfume arrived on time and is the same available at large department stores.  </li>
      <li>It was brand new and arrived exactly on time.  </li>
      <li>Decent price for the size.</li>
      <li>Smells clean and fresh, last a long time.</li>
      <li>I get a new bottle for her whenever she runs out.</li>
      <li>same thing as in the high price retail stores at a much lower price.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a couple of new ones, Pure White Linen, can&#x27;t remember the other one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but not as much as some, and the scent is pleasant, not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d favor White Linen for dramatic evenings, but I love it for daytime use.</li>

<li> I have used White Linen for decades; however, this one had started to go bad</li>
<li> Too bad the price has continued to escalate over the years.</li>

    <li> It was perfect and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE WEARS THIS PERFUME AL THE TIME AND WHAT WE GOT WAS AS GOOD AS SHE HAD GOTTEN B4</li>
    <li> If heaven smell as good as this... no one will go to sleep. This is an attention grabber and it&#x27;s been around awhile.</li>
    <li> This is the Best perfum. I always wear this.</li>
    <li> what can i say... my wife wanted this stuff, so i bought it and now she is happy!!!!  so now i am happy...that she is happy...ha!</li>
    <li> Smells great as usual</li>
    <li> I laways liked white linen but just could not find it.  I really like the clean smell.</li>
    <li> Scents and fragrances are very personal, so I rate White Linen 5 stars because it is exactly the fragrance that makes the woman I bought it for exuberantly happy.  She loves the smell, she loves the way it makes her feel when she wears it and it makes her wonderfully content every time she puts it on.</li>
    <li> Always loved this perfume</li>
    <li> Quality product from a quality company.</li>
    <li> This is such a beautiful, floral scent.  Not over-powering at all.  Once, I was stopped by a gentleman in the elevator at work.  He commented that my perfume was so nice, lingering, not over-powering.  (No, he was not hitting on me, at all.)  I told him the name so that he could buy it for his wife.  Also, the old &#x27;White Linen&#x27; is difficult to find anymore.  There&#x27;s a couple of new ones, Pure White Linen, can&#x27;t remember the other one.  Amazon also had the better price and, taa-daa, free shipping with Prime.</li>
    <li> Just what the recipient wanted!</li>
    <li> Get lots of compliments on this. It&#x27;s expensive, but not as much as some, and the scent is pleasant, not overwhelming. (I also use Hermes Caleche and Yves Saint Laurent Opium, both of which are much stronger, better for evening scent. Caleche is OK for business settings in which scent is acceptable. Opium is too strong for that. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d favor White Linen for dramatic evenings, but I love it for daytime use. Besides, it reminds me of my mom and grandmother.</li>
    <li> I started wearing this fragrance a long time ago, I stopped wearing it because all of my friends liked the way it smelled on me and then they started wearing it! Now that I live in a different place, I found it hard to find here in the south. This looks like a job for AMAZON!! Found a larger size with a better price than on the Estee Lauder website right here on Amazon, now I can have my scent all to myself, as much as I want, for a great price. The scent is a clean, fresh, light flowery scent that isn&#x27;t over powering. I love this fragrance and now that Estee Lauder has put out Pure White Linen, just the regular White Linen isn&#x27;t pushed a lot so I won&#x27;t be in a room with half of the women wearing my scent. Happy as can be with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Estee for years and this fragrance is light, appealing, and not too sweet.</li>
    <li> LOVE this perfume and ALWAYS get compliments on how nice I smell.  Have worn it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I have used White Linen for decades; however, this one had started to go bad and I couldn&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s prohibited to ship this type of item.  I couldn&#x27;t find any information on the website or in the shipping information on how to get my money back.  Now I&#x27;m out $71.00 which I could have used to buy it elsewhere.  I recommend buying it in a store where you know what you are getting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Estee Lauder White Linen for 27 years.  Love love it everyone always say&#x27;s I smell like fresh soap.  I will definitely keep ordering on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It works for me because my wife likes it and makes a great present.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to any woman she would love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the scent that my wife loves to wear and I like it on her. I get a new bottle for her whenever she runs out.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my step mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this perfume for years and I have bought it from Amazon a number of times.  This is her favorite perfume and has been for a long time.  She has used a number of the famous perfumes and still does, but when her bottle of this gets low, she is quick to let me know.  So from my perspective, happy wife, happy life.</li>
    <li> Been using it since I was a teen. This is a timeless fragrance that makes you feel fresh and clean. Hope Estee Lauder never changes the formula!</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift. The price was excellent.</li>
    <li> The delivery was very fast and my wife loves this perfume.</li>
    <li> Have been purchasing for more than 30 years.  Ageless fragrance that allows one to feel as if they have just walked out of the shower.  Smells fresh and clean.  Too bad the price has continued to escalate over the years.</li>
    <li> Great price and the shipping was free. Packed well. My wife liked it. I liked it so much I just reordered another bottle. I am a return customer. same thing as in the high price retail stores at a much lower price. What more can I say.</li>
    <li> Received on time and intact!!!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Smells clean and fresh, last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great perfume! My mother loves this line of perfume. It is a perfect gift for any occasion. Decent price for the size.</li>
    <li> The item was brand new, delivered quickly and ready for use as a Christmas gift. It brought great pleasure to the recepient of this gift. THanks, A+++ Amazoner!!</li>
    <li> The perfume arrived on time and is the same available at large department stores.  My wife loves the perfume, and it is a perfume that doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies, so I love it too.</li>
    <li> What can I say, my wife asks for this every year (for the last 10 years.)&lt;br /&gt;She loves it . . . I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I purchased it for Mom, and she loved it.</li>
    <li> My wife wears White Linen Eau de Parfum by Estee Lauder or she wears nothing at all. Either way is beautiful.</li>
    <li> There really is not much to say about a product that has passed the test of time. I have used my Estee Lauter White Linen for many years. The one thing I can brag about is the fact that Amazon has saved me many dollars not only in the price of the item, but the time and effort it would take to go to the store to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the cleanest fragrance available on the market. I love to wear it day and night because it is suttle and soft, clean. I have used it for years and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love White Linen. It is the only fragrance I wear. Amazon delivered a great product at an amazing price!</li>
    <li> White Linen is my favorite cologne.  It has such a clean and crisp smell to it.  It was brand new and arrived exactly on time.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Every time I wore White Linen I would get at least one - &amp;#34;Mmm you smell good&amp;#34; comment.  So I quite using anything else and now White Linen is my signature scent that I wear every day.</li>
    <li> I have used WL for years and I love for our HOT Texas summers!</li>
    <li> Fantastic, CLEAN fragrance. After 36 years of NO fragrance wearing - migraines - I find I am once again able to wear them. This fragrance has a clean scent and it lasts ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT - it is STRONG. Wear it very lightly, please. Have mercy on those around you who cannot tolerate perfumes. I step out of the shower, dry off, put one spritz into the air, and walk through it. That is PLENTY. Or I spray a VERY light spritz on my abdomen and dress. I would not put it on skin that isn&#x27;t covered with clothing because I think it would be too strong. I like a HINT of scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is clean, fresh, and can be light if you don&#x27;t overdo it. It makes me think of a cabin in a wooded mountain site where my husband and I like to get away from the city hubbub to. Lovely scent.</li>
    <li> Will probably never use any other fragerance. I wish they would do gift boxes with more products! Still love it!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for the girl friend for a birthday, one of her favorites for ever and a repeat buy again and again</li>
    <li> I always love me some White Linen perfume.</li>
