### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great company!  </li>
      <li>This is a great product to use!</li>
      <li>LOL!</li>
      <li>I went ahead and ordered, hoping for the best.</li>
      <li>It smells great too!</li>
      <li>The oil has a delicious and nutty smell too.</li>
      <li>EXCELLENT MOISTURIZER FOR THE HAIR</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>: I would apply this to my scalp about 3 nights a week, massaging it in to the barer areas, then combing it through the hair for the beautiful shine.</li>
      <li>but it is a great moisturizer will continue to use to see if they improve  anymore</li>
      <li>but I am really happy to have found this one.  </li>
      <li>This castor oil is great for rubbing it around the eyes, eyelashes, eyebrow, face and lips.</li>
      <li>The service from the company is great.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Felt good on my skin</li>
      <li>i thought it was just good for making vehicle motor oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product was shipped to me quickly and in perfect condition.  </li>
      <li>: I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
      <li>I simply love it!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Product seems authentic!</li>
      <li>This oil has a pleasant, nutty smell that is not at all overwhelming.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You won&#x27;t regret trying this oil, it has many great properties and uses and best of all, IT\\&quot;S NATURAL!</li>
      <li>I, honestly, haven&#x27;t tried this myself, because it was a request from my grandson.  </li>
      <li>I love that I can keep this handy and use as needed.</li>
      <li>Hoping for the best as I like natural products.  </li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and feel that you will be too!</li>
      <li>It has a nice consistency that is easy to apply to the scalp, but can also be used all over the hair as a moisturizer and protectant.</li>
      <li>My hair is healthy and conditioned.  </li>
      <li>day i noticed a thinning spot on top.</li>
      <li>My hair seemed to respond a lot better to coconut oil by itself</li>
      <li>This is quite simply the best decision I have ever made buying this product.</li>
      <li>Its not a horrible smell, but not a smell I want to have in my hair.</li>
      <li>One more thing about the oil is that, it smells like coffee when I apply it on my hair, but it fades out with time.</li>
      <li>Enjoying its benefits and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>This one is my favorite as a skin treatment most of all.</li>
      <li>I use my Aveya castor oil in many ways - for my hair, skin and even sore muscles.</li>
      <li>This is a great quality product that can naturally help our hair and skin!  </li>
      <li>Because the scent is strong, I wouldn&#x27;t use before going out.</li>
      <li>What I didn&#x27;t pay attention to at first was how nice it makes my nails and cuticles feel.</li>
      <li>Although the smell wasn&#x27;t pleasant its still bearable and this old does what is suppose to do as advertised.</li>
      <li>and they quickly replied (impressed with their support center)  </li>
      <li>After showering in the morning my hair was SILKY SMOOTH, and shiny.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I needed to dilute the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 weeks in and my scalp is no longer dry and itchy, I am happy with the results I am getting.</li>
      <li>*was* able to read the printing, I liked that users are advised that using more than a little oil (on the hair) isn&#x27;t needed to get full benefits.</li>
      <li>I also use it on my scalp (though not yet on the hair itself) and what I like is that it can be used almost like a lotion (as far as applying it anywhere on my body) and just rubbing it in well to get way more moisturizing benefit without a strong odor or a slick/greasy feel or look.</li>
      <li>I think that coconut oil works better, is cheaper, and has most of the same uses as this castor oil.</li>
      <li>He has not complained about it, though I don&#x27;t notice that he has any more hair growth than when I sent it to him, but it&#x27;s supposed to help with hair growth, so, like women do with make-up, if you need it, try it.</li>
      <li>and I got results after the first application!</li>
      <li>My eyebrows have always been very light (I&#x27;m blonde) and fine.</li>
      <li>but it is also quite easily absorbed.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this is the only product I&#x27;m applying to my brows.</li>
      <li>This product is very easy to use, has a nice light smell, and will last you a very long time!</li>
      <li>I find it to be good quality but extremely overpriced for the quantity ( 4 ounces for $25.42).</li>
      <li>Works well for me, I made the right choice.  </li>
      <li>It made my normally damaged split ends look healthy, and my hair looks and feels absolutely silky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll still recommend it, but if your sensitive to strong smells..</li>
      <li>I use it as a hot oil treatment for my hair</li>
      <li>To me it smells exactly like sesame oil.</li>
      <li>My mom most definitely needs this.</li>
      <li>Then, I received the product within 2 days and the first day I started to use it I saw results.</li>
      <li>Seems to be reliable and does exactly what it states.</li>
      <li>Vitamin E is so essential to healthy skin.  </li>
      <li>first couple of weeks using this oil caused severe itching</li>
      <li>They also provided many other helpful and cool tips which helped.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair gets neglected the most as it is pretty long (it is almost till my hips)</li>
      <li>Also, it really doesn&#x27;t take very much (on the skin) to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
      <li>First off, upon ordering I got an entire email filled with tips and tricks to maximize the effects of the oil.</li>
      <li>I notice hair re-growing in certain areas, not in all the areas I applied it, or where I was hoping for re-growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Who would have known that pure Castor oil - what our grandmother&#x27;s used - is so modern and helpful today.  </li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t really notice that my lashes are getting thicker or longer.</li>
      <li>When I told them how much I paid for it, they said I could have bought 5 of these for that price.</li>
      <li>I was very close to returning this product, but before I did I thought I should reach out to the customer support.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for good reviews and any product that claims it can improve my looks.</li>
      <li>was intrigued to read that pure black castor oil might be able to nourish hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;(Prior</li>
      <li>but I am happy that my hair is at least starting to look healthier.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This pure and natural unrefined liquid castor oil may be my hope to growing my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>I was able to use it while on vacation on the beach but not sure if it really helps your hair to grow.  </li>
      <li>Both the kitchen oil and the black oil of another brand that I was using were fine although they are much heavier than I like for use on my skin.</li>
      <li>More recently, I was using a black castor oil</li>
      <li>and I decided to give it a shot especially because it&#x27;s all natural and extremely pure.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m nearly 58 now.</li>
      <li>I have been applying it to my eyelashes and eyebrows and so far they seem to be stronger.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a no-brainer that this is a cheaper and natural solution for me.</li>
      <li>When I got this I was surprised by the shipping speed.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a hair thinning problem but do have dry hair, and love how it makes my hair feel healthier and even a little thicker.  </li>
      <li>I even used it on my sun burn, and it totally worked, highly recommend Aveya Beauty oil.</li>
      <li>There is no other ingredient in the  haitian castor oil  but the castor oil.</li>
      <li>I know that it will take some time and a multiple use of the castor oil, for me to actually have some new hair</li>
      <li>Since I have dry cuticles, I decided to use it on them as well, and it has really moisturized my hands and made them look younger.</li>
      <li>It was much faster than some of the other purchases I&#x27;ve made before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know what other people were talking about.</li>

<li> Caribbean Roots Black Castor Oil only has 4 ingredients, which are 100% natural and organic.</li>

<li> I found the product to be no more different than the Extra Dark Jamaican Black Castor oil that I also bought ( 8 ounces for $11 which equals the $5 for the 4 ounces that my relatives guessed it was worth).</li>
<li> My hair is a little on the fuzzy, slightly frizzy side and using the oil really smoothed it and made it shiny and bouncy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had been a little apprehensive about ordering the castor oil because I heard it said that the smell was really bad and overpowering. I went ahead and ordered, hoping for the best. Well, my bottle arrived a few days ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it religiously. But the bad smell? There is none. I really don&#x27;t know what other people were talking about. It&#x27;s a very pleasant smell. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is quite simply the best decision I have ever made buying this product. I have, or should I say had, very thin hair that seemed to fall out every turn I took. My friend told me about this Castor Oil and I decided to give it a shot especially because it&#x27;s all natural and extremely pure. Now i&#x27;m never going back! First off, upon ordering I got an entire email filled with tips and tricks to maximize the effects of the oil. Then, I received the product within 2 days and the first day I started to use it I saw results. The oil has a delicious and nutty smell too. My hair feels baby soft and has thickened up more than with any other expensive treatment. I also applied it to my skin and I feel the collagen restoring and tightening before my eyes. I also put some on my husband&#x27;s scalp where he is bald and he&#x27;s already growing hair back and moisturizing from the ground up! I am so happy with this product. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price, quality, and purity. If you are looking for something to rejuvenate and regenerate either your hair or skin, look no further.</li>
    <li> I decided I&#x27;d try it out for 3 months. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 1 month. I KNOW it works because I have all these little gray hairs sprouting out, that I didn&#x27;t before. So now I have to get my hair colored again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YET... I notice hair re-growing in certain areas, not in all the areas I applied it, or where I was hoping for re-growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, it does have that &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; scent. But I can see how it could bother others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply: I would apply this to my scalp about 3 nights a week, massaging it in to the barer areas, then combing it through the hair for the beautiful shine. I would throw my hair in a pony tail and put a towel over my pillow and let it soak in over night. After showering in the morning my hair was SILKY SMOOTH, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I have to stop using this product (the only one I&#x27;ve ever found to work), because I had an allergic reaction to it. Please don&#x27;t let that stop you from trying it!  I&#x27;d use it for the rest of my life if I could.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working but i&#x27;m not using it everyday as I should. The smell isn&#x27;t bad as people complain about.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil after reading several reviews, hoping that it will help with my dry itchy scalp. Here&#x27;s my experience with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first couple of weeks using this oil caused severe itching and I didn&#x27;t know why. I was very close to returning this product, but before I did I thought I should reach out to the customer support. Never hurts to ask, maybe I am doing something wrong, and they can give me some advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I send them an email and they quickly replied (impressed with their support center)  The verdict: because of my hair type (I have a thick hair) I needed to dilute the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 weeks in and my scalp is no longer dry and itchy, I am happy with the results I am getting. I even used it on my sun burn, and it totally worked, highly recommend Aveya Beauty oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for good reviews and any product that claims it can improve my looks. My eyebrows have always been very light (I&#x27;m blonde) and fine. Started using this 3 months ago and my brows have darkened slightly and have thickened; so much so that the woman who waxes my brows noticed a big difference and could not believe it was due to this product. Honestly, this is the only product I&#x27;m applying to my brows. Use it every night. My cosmetologist is telling all of her clients.</li>
    <li> This product smells HORRIBLE!  In fact, the smell is so awful, I cannot use it. I&#x27;m sorry I purchased the product.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommended this product. It has become a staple in my hair care regimen. Used it this evening. Doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> When I got this I was surprised by the shipping speed. It was much faster than some of the other purchases I&#x27;ve made before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one thing I didn&#x27;t like about this was it smelled really bad. I almost felt like I was going to faint and past out. So I had to dilute it with olive oil which the Aveya owners recommended in the email, which did the trick. They also provided many other helpful and cool tips which helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 2-3 weeks and it helped reduce my dandruff and the edges of my hair are starting to grow back. Although the smell wasn&#x27;t pleasant its still bearable and this old does what is suppose to do as advertised. I&#x27;ll still recommend it, but if your sensitive to strong smells.. well at least you know now.</li>
    <li> I was looking for haitian castor oil and found this product. I find it to be good quality but extremely overpriced for the quantity ( 4 ounces for $25.42). I showed the product to haitian relatives and they guessed that they would pay $3-$5 for this. When I told them how much I paid for it, they said I could have bought 5 of these for that price. I found the product to be no more different than the Extra Dark Jamaican Black Castor oil that I also bought ( 8 ounces for $11 which equals the $5 for the 4 ounces that my relatives guessed it was worth). There is no other ingredient in the  haitian castor oil  but the castor oil. Can not figure out the reason for the exhortibant price.</li>
    <li> This is my weekly hair treatment.  My hair is healthy and conditioned.  I follow the suggestion on the bottle and apply it to wet hair for 30 minutes.  I also use it on my eyebrows.  My brows are regaining their fullness.</li>
    <li> I used this oil as Aveya Beauty said I should and noticed no difference in my hair-- I used the entire bottle and still nothing. I tried using it several different ways and felt no difference. I am Native American and white... my hair is naturally curly, I usually don&#x27;t use hair products on my hair... maybe mousse or hairspray, but my hair is dry so I thought I&#x27;d try this oil. I heated the oil and left on my hair for hours, heated the oil and used with coconut oil and left it on, and just put the oil on my hair at room temperature and left on for hours. No difference. I hated the smell of this castor oil, it smelled like really old peanut butter or something. The smell would still be in my hair after several washes. My hair seemed to respond a lot better to coconut oil by itself so I guess that&#x27;s what I will use. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so I wouldn&#x27;t say that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, but just giving my experience with it. I think that coconut oil works better, is cheaper, and has most of the same uses as this castor oil.</li>
    <li> The service from the company is great.  They also follow up with an email on how to use the product.  If you wash your hair in the morning you can use this product but if you are like me and wash it at night, it difficult to find the time to leave it in your hair.  I was able to use it while on vacation on the beach but not sure if it really helps your hair to grow.  Trying it on my eyebrows to see if it works.  Hoping for the best as I like natural products.  If anyone uses this stuff please send me ways you use it. Great company!  Product seems authentic!</li>
    <li> Around 4 years ago i started losing hair due to stress.&lt;br /&gt;I was finding hair on my floors and hairbrush. And Swamp Monsters being fished out of clogged shower drains :C&lt;br /&gt;I could&#x27;ve stuffed a small pillow with all the lost hair :C&lt;br /&gt;One day i noticed a thinning spot on top. I could see scalp through the thinning forest.&lt;br /&gt;I did a temporary fix by parting my hair differently to hide the thinning area.&lt;br /&gt;I knew that wouldn&#x27;t last forever as i didn&#x27;t want to become like those who combed over a few remaining strands of long&lt;br /&gt;hair to cover up glaring bald spot which they are in obvious denial of.&lt;br /&gt;Gramps Sam once said to me do NOT use Rogaine cuz its very very expensive and that if you stop, your hair falls out at a faster rate than before.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to find something that would strengthen &amp; nourish the hair roots.&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued to read that pure black castor oil might be able to nourish hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;(Prior to finding this product, i only knew of castor oil as an abhorred medicine shoved at gramma when she got sick as a child.&lt;br /&gt;Or was she talking about cod liver oil???)&lt;br /&gt;Or i thought it was just good for making vehicle motor oil.&lt;br /&gt;Who knew that there is a type of therapeutic castor oil like this?</li>
    <li> In the past I have used &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; castor oil (as taught by my grandma &amp; mom) for internal use benefits. More recently, I was using a black castor oil but I am really happy to have found this one.  Both the kitchen oil and the black oil of another brand that I was using were fine although they are much heavier than I like for use on my skin. This one is my favorite as a skin treatment most of all. I also use it on my scalp (though not yet on the hair itself) and what I like is that it can be used almost like a lotion (as far as applying it anywhere on my body) and just rubbing it in well to get way more moisturizing benefit without a strong odor or a slick/greasy feel or look. What I didn&#x27;t pay attention to at first was how nice it makes my nails and cuticles feel. With a lot of my other oils (especially the other brand of castor oil I use), I don&#x27;t carry them in my purse for random moisturizing because of their heaviness (or the oily residue). I love that I can keep this handy and use as needed. The one thing that was annoying was the teensy print on the sides of the label. I couldn&#x27;t fully read the listed benefits or usage instructions and I actually had to use a magnifying app on my phone to make it out. Once I *was* able to read the printing, I liked that users are advised that using more than a little oil (on the hair) isn&#x27;t needed to get full benefits. Usually, brands try to get you to use up as much product as possible. Also, it really doesn&#x27;t take very much (on the skin) to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> After my daughter was born, I have almost forgotten to take care of my hair. My hair gets neglected the most as it is pretty long (it is almost till my hips) and it takes a lot of time when I want to do something with it.  Even if I want to apply some oil, I get engaged with some or the other thing and it skips my mind. The result is devastating, my hair is so dull that even a shampoo and conditioner do not give it any shine and I am losing hair like crazy, even my hair line is receding. Overall it looked lifeless. I have used the castor oil for 3 times now well my head is NOT full of extra hairs yet, but I can see a shine and a slight improvement of my hair overall health.  I know that it will take some time and a multiple use of the castor oil, for me to actually have some new hair but I am happy that my hair is at least starting to look healthier. As the castor oil is very thick it is easier to apply when I mix it with coconut oil. I prefer warming up the coconut oil a little and then mix the castor oil in it and then apply the mixture on my scalp and let it remain overnight and shampoo the next morning. In fact using the mixture of the oils made my hair bouncy too and the split ends have also improved. One more thing about the oil is that, it smells like coffee when I apply it on my hair, but it fades out with time. **I received the product in exchange of my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This product came as described.  Works well for me, I made the right choice.  Seems to be reliable and does exactly what it states.</li>
    <li> This castor oil is great for rubbing it around the eyes, eyelashes, eyebrow, face and lips. It has made my eyebrows healthier looking and eyelashes longer. Rub it on at night prior to going to sleep every night.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT MOISTURIZER FOR THE HAIR</li>
    <li> Black Castor oil is not only darker than typical clear version, it has smokey scent and thicker consistency. I rub into my scalp before bed and rinse out in the morning. Because the scent is strong, I wouldn&#x27;t use before going out. Overall I like the product.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews this product does seem to work well for some people, but it did nothing for me. I purchased it because my hair was thinning, and I also wanted to try it on my eyelashes and brows. I have thick coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant to use it because when it arrived the cap did not have a plastic safety seal.  To me it smells exactly like sesame oil. Its not a horrible smell, but not a smell I want to have in my hair. Maybe drizzled over chicken stir fry.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and even after shampooing I could smell it in my hair, and it weighed my hair down. I used it as a pre shampoo conditioning treatment, and sometimes would apply a small amount to thinning areas after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 months of use I saw no improvement in the thinning of my hair.  I discontinued because I couldn&#x27;t deal with the smell any longer. Maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time?  I also wonder if it was defective since there was no seal on the cap.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped to me quickly and in perfect condition.  I have been applying it to my eyelashes and eyebrows and so far they seem to be stronger.  I will update later on!</li>
    <li> Have been using for 3 week I bought for my lashes, they have grown just a lil not much but it is a great moisturizer will continue to use to see if they improve  anymore</li>
    <li> I, honestly, haven&#x27;t tried this myself, because it was a request from my grandson.  He has not complained about it, though I don&#x27;t notice that he has any more hair growth than when I sent it to him, but it&#x27;s supposed to help with hair growth, so, like women do with make-up, if you need it, try it.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2YG625LO11QFE]]I decided to make a short video showing my hair after using Caribbean Roots Black Castor Oil. My hair is a little on the fuzzy, slightly frizzy side and using the oil really smoothed it and made it shiny and bouncy. It smells great too! I plan on using it on my eyebrows every day because they have never grown again since I plucked them to death once when I was 16 and I&#x27;m nearly 58 now. It may be too late but I&#x27;m going to give it a go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret trying this oil, it has many great properties and uses and best of all, IT\\&quot;S NATURAL!</li>
    <li> The name reminded me (not fondly)of a usage from a time long past--but this was recommended as a solution to my dry scalp. I expected it to be thick and it is but it is also quite easily absorbed. Felt good on my skin so I use it anywhere my skin is dry. It is thick, which I like, but you may want to add other oils to thin it out or add fragrance. Enjoying its benefits and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a friend of a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What piqued my interest about this product is that I can use it for my EYELASHES! My eyelashes are short and thin. I spend about $40/month on eyelash extensions. This pure and natural unrefined liquid castor oil may be my hope to growing my eyelashes. It&#x27;s a no-brainer that this is a cheaper and natural solution for me. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason why I like this product is for hair growth. I read up on hair growth, women balding, and their chances for hair re-growth. If you&#x27;re in this predicament, give this a try. Based on my findings (I am not a doctor nor am I providing medical advice), 95% of women experiencing hair loss grow their hair back. My mom most definitely needs this. LOL!</li>
    <li> This is a great quality product that can naturally help our hair and skin!  Vitamin E is so essential to healthy skin.  Who would have known that pure Castor oil - what our grandmother&#x27;s used - is so modern and helpful today.  I don&#x27;t have a hair thinning problem but do have dry hair, and love how it makes my hair feel healthier and even a little thicker.  I am recommending this to my family and friends. This is a great product to use!</li>
    <li> Too little for the price this is the cheapest oil in Haiti. Black market..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as often as the other reviewer as it&#x27;s oily and I wear contact lenses and the oil gets in my eyes and on my contacts. I do try to use at least once a week. I have had this for over two month and I haven&#x27;t really notice that my lashes are getting thicker or longer.</li>
    <li> I use my Aveya castor oil in many ways - for my hair, skin and even sore muscles. I use it as a hot oil treatment for my hair and I got results after the first application! It made my normally damaged split ends look healthy, and my hair looks and feels absolutely silky. I can&#x27;t wait to see what a few months of using it will do! Since I have dry cuticles, I decided to use it on them as well, and it has really moisturized my hands and made them look younger. This oil has a pleasant, nutty smell that is not at all overwhelming. Wherever I use it on my skin, it leaves it with a glossy look to it. I simply love it!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moC3UOWG4XYGB0]]This video showcases how to apply the oil and also mentions its benefits. This product is very easy to use, has a nice light smell, and will last you a very long time! It has a nice consistency that is easy to apply to the scalp, but can also be used all over the hair as a moisturizer and protectant. Caribbean Roots Black Castor Oil only has 4 ingredients, which are 100% natural and organic. There&#x27;s no fillers or other synthetic ingredients to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After continued use, I hope to achieve fuller hair and I hope to thicken my thinning edges. So far, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and feel that you will be too!</li>
