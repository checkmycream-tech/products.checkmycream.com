<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This type of eyeliner is way better than any pencil I&#x27;ve ever used, even the &amp;#34;self sharpening&amp;#34; ones that you twist. Liquid doesn&#x27;t compare either, it just runs everywhere. This stays put really well and goes on really nicely and easily. The brush is cheap and a bit bristly but it doesn&#x27;t ruin the application. The eyeliner is smaller than I expected too.</li>
    <li> Save your money and go buy it at target. It&#x27;s even cheaper. I believe it was only $2!!! As any elf products are, mostly $1.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great cream eye liner, and the brush works really well, i&#x27;m just very disappointed that I payed $11 for this (about $5 shipping), when it&#x27;s SO small! compared to say, a regular sized bottle of OPI nail polish, about a third or less of the bottle is how much eye liner is in this. so unless you have prime and can get free shipping, you might not want to pay that much for so little.</li>
    <li> This is a gel eyeliner and it works so well. It goes on easy &amp; stays on. It really is amazing &amp; unbelievable. I love it. I need more colors.</li>
    <li> I have been on a search for the perfect eye liner that stays on all day.  This one stays on longer than the Bobbi Brown one that I purchased and reviewed, but it still doesn&#x27;t last all day.  If I look into the mirror after a few hours, it&#x27;s all patchy. I have deeper set eyes and maybe that&#x27;s part of my problem, but I can&#x27;t validate that. I only know its staying-power on my eyes and it&#x27;s not very good.  I&#x27;d rate it fair.</li>
    <li> I have seen lots of reviews on this product. Some say the eyeliner dries out but mine hasn&#x27;t. The main issues I have with it is that the color is not black (more of a grayish color)and that on elf.com it s 3 dollars instead of 6.</li>
    <li> I took a gamble buying this based on reviews. My skin is pretty oily so this smudged and gave the raccoon eye quite a bit. Is a nice color and it was easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This is great! I have never been very good at putting make up on but this eye liner is easy to put on and looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and I think thats a good time to really get to know a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;Easy to maneuver&lt;br /&gt;Very Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its runs horribly, after a few hours of dancing or even after 8 hours of working, I ended up with raccoon eyes.  I cant even use it for that reason alone. I just wish it stayed where you put it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this item! It&#x27;s so easy to put on. It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected but that&#x27;s ok. I put the eyeliner on perfectly immediately when I received it. I took a nap afterwards and when I woke up, it didn&#x27;t smudge AT ALL. It was as if I&#x27;d just put it on! It is PURE black and I LOVE it. Absolutely amazing for such a low prics.</li>
    <li> it is nice and creamy and applies well, but in an hour i get creases, and in a couple of hours half of it is smudged.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream eyeliner, it goes on silky smooth! And you can&#x27;t beat the price! Well actually you CAN beat the price if you buy directly from the ELF website or at Walmart, but this brand is not only affordable, but also CRUELTY-FREE!!! ELF has a bunch of great makeup products. I love them!</li>
    <li> the eyeliner gel very good and i love it but i dont like the brush, so small and not soft so when i apply gel, my eyelids feel uncomfy !</li>
    <li> It did not came with the eyeliner pencil.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is good but the brush sucks I recommend buying a separate brush</li>
    <li> I remember using this eyeliner an year ago and I loved it at that time so I re-ordered now that I am back into wearing eyeliners but I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong because now it smudges really bad. It like the application and ease of use but it smudges A LOT and has to be reapplied if you want your makeup look to last for more than 4-5 hours. I still like it but I wish it did not smudge.</li>
    <li> While I like elf products, it seems the drug store brand Nyx beats it out yet again. While the cream eyeliner is all right, I find it a bit clumpier and more annoying to apply as opposed to using a Nyx milk pencil to prime and then using Nyx black eyeshadow palette with an angled brush.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this for tightlining. Doesn&#x27;t work for me, sadness!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy, smooth application&lt;br /&gt;- Brush is on the cheap-ish side but works for what I needed&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t work for tightlining for me - it transferred immediately to my lower eyelid&lt;br /&gt;- Smudges REALLY easily on my eye&lt;br /&gt;Looks like other people have had much more success, so it might just be my skin. I dunno, but this is unusable for me.</li>
    <li> Transfer city! 😖 even with eye primer this stuff ends up all over my lids after a couple hours. Bummer. Won&#x27;t buy again. Would not recommend if you&#x27;re looking for all day wear.</li>
    <li> I have tried many types of [affordable] eyeliners, and this is by far my favorite. It offers me the most control, even coverage, and it glides on effortlessly. Plus, I love that e.l.f. is a cruelty free company, and certainly the most affordable one that I have found for make-up thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product and will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had, even better than eyeliners I&#x27;ve bought that were a lot more expensive. I absolutely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product!! More than I expected for the price!! Love it! They need to improve the brush quality though.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s very easy to apply. However it does smudge after a few hours of wearing it. I still wear it but would be nice if it didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
    <li> i am really loving this eyeliner. never having tried any other cream eyeliner, i can&#x27;t really compare it to anything, but this is seriously great stuff. i would choose it over an eyeliner pencil or liquid eyeliner any day. smooth execution + it comes with a little angle brush as well. pretty sure it&#x27;s waterproof, as well, it stays on all day with very minimal smudging. i&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyelinner! it slides on really smooth and it does not look cakey or too heavy. it looks very clean and its just great</li>
    <li> This cream eyeliner by e.l.f. is amazing. Me personally I don&#x27;t like liquid liners that come in the little tube with the little thin brush I can never get an accurate line. But with this my lines and my wings PERFECT!!!</li>
    <li> The eyeliner rocks, but the applicator brush is a POS. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner lasts forever on me though!</li>
    <li> This is pretty much the only eyeliner I need. I love how smoothly it goes on and how it rims my eyes. I&#x27;ve worn eyeliner for almost every day for about three months since I bought this and I haven&#x27;t run out yet so it&#x27;s definitely a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> love this creamy product and will use it everytime.</li>
    <li> This is one of the smudgiest eyeliners I&#x27;ve owned. I don&#x27;t know how it has gotten so many good reviews, but I&#x27;m used to Urban Decay&#x27;s eye pencil in Perversion, and that stuff is blackest black and lasts for days. Maybe I just shouldn&#x27;t compare high-end products to drug store ones. /sigh</li>
    <li> Amazing eyeliner for the price!! Definitely cheaper in stores but the eyeliner it self works great and I would definitely suggest it to make up lovers</li>
    <li> This is practically the only top eyeliner I&#x27;m able to apply on myself</li>
    <li> This product was ok. It had a nice color. Was easy to apply. The color lasted pretty much all day with out smearing or running. It was never open for loner than 2 min while applying. I used about 1/3 of it and noticed it was like drying out. Was not going on as nice. It dried almost hard. It separated from the sides and I was left with this small black useless patty. Wouldn&#x27;t apply. I would have like to have been able to use more than half. I had it a little over a month.</li>
    <li> I like the gel creme. It&#x27;s the brush that doesn&#x27;t hold out, but you can always buy more brushes. I think this is better than using an eyeliner pencil.</li>
    <li> Does the job I want it to do.  The only problems I&#x27;ve ever had with this product are entirely due to my relative inexperience with gel eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Nice but dries quickly</li>
    <li> Work in an environment where it is important I get a liner that lasts.  This held up nicely and did not run.</li>
    <li> IT IS JUST PERFECTION</li>
    <li> Smeared very easy had to remove before leaving the house for work.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner, it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, goes on very quickly and easily, love it, love it. Been wearing eyeliner for 30 years. I will never use pencil again. Great price. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love using cream/kajal/liquid eye liner on the eyes compared to the hard pencil ones. This product was easy to apply and came off easily with a makeup removing tissue with a wipe. Definately worth the buy</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good, but the size is very small.. i expected more bigger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just try it today and it looks extremely good I love the line on my eye, plus is easy to use and I got it in the right time I got a note from the seller and I thought that&#x27;s nice. Of them thank you</li>
    <li> This is the second time i have bought this and its absolutely amazing. Easy to put on and last a VERY long time.</li>
    <li> I would always try and use pencil eyeliners, or the waterproof pen eyeliners to line my top eyelid.  They never worked for me and it always came out horrible.  The pen eyeliners dried out way too fast.  But this is perfect! It&#x27;s great for a beginner like me, goes on smooth, and is dark enough.  Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. It go on really easy and in a straight. The brush kind of sucks, but works, I just bought a better one to go with it.</li>
    <li> This ELF gel eyeliner is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  It adds great color at the &amp;#34;water line&amp;#34;,  Use an angle brush, (also purchased at Amazon) and you have a great eyelining team. I highly recommend, and with free shipping? Can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly,  goes on well just not water proof.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much good one nice to work with helpful cooperative good material I like it I appreciate it</li>
    <li> Not that great hard to use and came pretty hard. Should be softer in the jar.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and takes way less time to put on. I just love it I would definitely recommend this to anyone that does makeup.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye liner I own!! You do need to have a study hand to get nice lines which I&#x27;ve become a pro at. It doesn&#x27;t get on my eyelashes which is what I was looking for because it interferes with the mascara so this was perfect for me.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner itself it really great. It goes on very easily (with the right brush) and doesn&#x27;t fall off or smear all over my eyelid. The brush that comes with it is super small and kinda cheap so I would suggest investing in a better eyeliner brush. :)</li>
    <li> It is a good paste eyeliner. I am not familiar with this type of eyeliner so the brush was rather small for me. Otherwise the shipping came early and the eyeliner goes on smoothly. I will continue to wear it. :)</li>
    <li> Love it.... I use this everyday its great and goes on so smooth</li>
    <li> I love it! Wish it was waterproof though.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try my item today, however i couldnt because the item did not even have the brush that was suppose to be included in the box.</li>
    <li> It is not as good as Maybelline - less opaque and takes longer to dry.  Smudges all over the place.  If you want a thick black line, this is not the one to use.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is the perfect consistency. It goes on real nice and smooth and stays on pretty well. It does wear off by dinner time, but it does not smear. It has limited waterproof ability but it does not run into your eyes. The brush it comes with is major lame... Hence docking the rating by one star.</li>
    <li> goes on smoothly and last all day..easily removed wtih eye make-up remover. one of the best eyeliners that I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> I tried this after using creamier eyeliners in the past, and I love how this stuff wears! If my skin is oily and I rub it directly, it will smudge, but it&#x27;s not like other products I&#x27;ve used that are gone by the end of the day even without any direct contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I get enough on my brush the first time, I don&#x27;t have to go back to darken it, but with less product on the brush it can go on thinner and be less than fully opaque. I&#x27;d say in terms of ease of application, it is about the same as other products I&#x27;ve used, but a good brush makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Seriously!  It is SO easy to apply; this coming from someone who has NEVER been able to wear liquid eyeliner my eyes weep every single time leaving my makeup everywhere.  It is VERY waterproof, easy to apply, and even easy to apply when/if you lose the original brush it comes with.  Goes on beautifully.  (This coming from a lifelong soldier who is not good with makeup!)  Also easy to create wingtips or whatever they are called on the corners of the eye the first time.  Recommendation?  After you dip your brush in the eyeliner make sure you wipe the excess off on the side of the jar it takes VERY LITTLE to be extraordinarily effective.</li>
    <li> this product its really good and it last for a very long time and its waterproof like it says !</li>
    <li> Very great eyeliner! I was going to get the maybelline gel eyeliner, but decided to get elf instead. I&#x27;m not disappointed. The brush isn&#x27;t the best, but you can&#x27;t really expect it to be. Does the job though.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this eyeliner since I do not have any experience with cream liner. It smudges if you do not set this with powder. But it is good for the price.</li>
    <li> It will shrink and then dries up after a while, as in a couple of months of use, it literally shrink and then dries up by itself.</li>
    <li> Amazing if you know how to use the brush last all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on to my 2nd pot of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Nice black pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Does not run or fade.&lt;br /&gt;Brush provided helps with easy application.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve found that the product dries out a bit quickly in the pot.  Maybe the cover is not airtight enough.&lt;br /&gt;A good buy.</li>
    <li> Oh...MY God!!!! I bought this at Walmart as an impulse buy.  I&#x27;ve been trying to do a winged liner look for quite some time but still seem to struggle with it.  This gel pot also comes with a small angled brush to apply it with and let me tell you, I&#x27;M HOOKED for life!!!!  Not only was it super easy to apply, but it was VERY dark and stayed on ALL day!!!!  My eyes have never looked better!!!  I have allergies and tend to forget I&#x27;m wearing makeup and then end up smudging all my hard work, but THIS STUFF stays EXACTLY where you put it!!!  MAN does it look AMAZING!!!!!  It is also so rich that one pot could easily last for YEARS!!!</li>
    <li> I love black eye liner and I decided t purchase this cream eyeliner, and I so love it! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is amazing. I use it wish a full sized eyeliner brush (not the one that comes with it) and I wear it every day. I recommend this 100%.</li>
    <li> It rubs off too much. Other then that it&#x27;s alright. It just rubs off the face so easily. Kinda pointless</li>
    <li> I am terrible at putting on liquid and pencil eyeliner so I decided to try gel. It&#x27;s so simple to put on! I would recommend this to anyone who needs a great eyeliner alternative.</li>
    <li> I love most of elf&#x27;s products for their cheap (if bought in store or directly from their site) prices and the fact that they don&#x27;t test on animals, but this was awful in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I almost feel bad for leaving a review since I never wore the product, but it&#x27;s because it was impossible to do so. As soon as I opened it, the liner had solidified completely and was unusable. My first clue should have been that it had condensed into a little pellet significantly smaller than its container. I&#x27;ve had gel liners dry up on me before, but never have I had one that was unusable upon purchase. I tried digging through the surface a little, thinking the inside of the pellet would be soft enough for a brush, but nope.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I just had an unlucky experience as most people here have positive reviews, but I know I&#x27;m not alone on this and I figured I should warn everyone of the possibility. Especially if you plan to pay this ridiculous price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> one of the best gel eyeliners I&#x27;ve encounters.  Nice and thick and goes on easy.. easy to smudge to get smokey eye effect but not soo easy to come off..ok though just get good eye remover..Don&#x27;t need to reapply over and over..once over the eyelid works great!</li>
    <li> Great eye liner I love it came in fast too</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! I&#x27;ve ordered this before and its amazing stuff.. once you use you will be hooked! Great price too</li>
    <li> This applies smoothly and is easier to apply than any other black eye liner I&#x27;ve used. Highly recommended for people who are not great with makeup, like myself.</li>
    <li> I like it. works, but does not go on smoothly for me at all.</li>
    <li> This is amazing eye liner. I ordered on December 29th and received it January 3rd. Amazing eyeliner for the price. Stays put, does not smudge. I really loved this eyeliner because I have dark skin, so many times it is hard to find a eyeliner that will be a true black, so it will show up on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You also get a cute little paper with your order showing you what company sent your product. I made sure to contact them via facebook to give me thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MUST BUY!!!</li>
    <li> My go to eyeliner, my favorite default eyeliner brush as well. A+, I would recomend</li>
    <li> I love it it&#x27;s so easy to apply :)) I&#x27;ve been looking for a good eyeliner and finally I found it!</li>
    <li> took 3 days to come, its more in the tube then in the pens and its really easy i love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought it would be. The brush included</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I absolutely love elf products and the condition it came in was good, the formula was creamy and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment; product as described!</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to apply and how well it stayed on.</li>
    <li> You cannot take it off so easily with regular makeup remover!</li>
    <li> Love it. Stays on and doesn&#x27;t run when sweating either. Glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> veryyyyy small I&#x27;m shocked, it looks larger in the picture but it works for travelling.</li>
    <li> looking for a product that does not wear off easily. It is better than others I have tried: pencils, cream liners…I like the way it goes on. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This was my first ever eyeliner in a pot. First off the brush is so little i didnt even bother trying to work with it, i could barely keep a hold on it. At first i loved it and used it everyday, and then it became dry and fell out of the pot. I continued to use it until i bought a new brand of gel liner and realized how terrible this really is. It would last a few hours before smudging off. The color payoff was very weak also.</li>
    <li> The brush is low quality. The eyeliner gets stuck to it and clumps. The bristles are also stiff and the handle is very short. Child like.</li>
    <li> My eyelids are incredibly oily, and I have found many drugstore eyeliners to smear everywhere even with primer. This one does not have that problem, and if applied over my Too Faced Shadow Insurance primer, stays for a good 10 hours without smearing or transferring to my upper lid. The brush works well, and the liner is a deep matte black. Be careful with the twist-off lid; it is easy to screw on wrong.</li>
    <li> This liner is very thick and easy to apply.  It may take a bit of getting used to if you normally use pencils that require a lot of pressure to fill in.  A little goes a long way and it is very smooth and soft.  It requires some steadiness to get a thin line, but it comes out looking very dark.</li>
    <li> I really like it.  It does stay on well and I like the consistancy.  I am not a fan of the brush.  I think E.L.F makes another longer brush I am going to try out.  It is difficult to remove unless you use an eyemake up remover but that is probably why it stays put well and doesn&#x27;t smudge!  It seems like it will last an extreemly long time if it does not dry out.</li>
    <li> I love this cream liner, I have bought two so far and I love it. I did not buy them on here I bought them in a store. this liner is so creamy and pigmented and I love it, I also adore the brush it comes with. I can do really nice even lines and the wear time is awesome. this lasts a good time and easy to reapply if I need a touch up.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, LOVE!!!  I&#x27;ve been getting more compliment on my makeup because I started using this!&lt;br /&gt;Love it so much, goes on so easy and also it stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge!</li>
    <li> A must have! Glides on every easy and lasts the entire day without making a mess. I recommend 100%</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this product and it is a must have I love it and it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that I didn&#x27;t recieve the small brush the second time but I had kept the original and the first time I bought it I didn&#x27;t use it alot and it dried out and shrunk which was very disappointing</li>
    <li> Waterproof and I have very sensitive eyes. This is perfect ! Doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all!</li>
    <li> love it. Best cream eyeliner</li>
    <li> I bought this off elfs website and it&#x27;s not good. It gave me raccoon eyes hour after putting on. Smudges easily. Prefer nyx or rimmel. I find that elf products are very hit or miss.</li>
    <li> Works just like I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> It has lasting power and goes on easily. Not a fan of the brush that comes with it though.</li>
    <li> I ordered this eyeliner, and it can in a smaller package than expected, way smaller. It was trial size for a full sized price. The eyeliner is also really bad about if you&#x27;re wearing it on your top eyelid, it will rub off where it touches when you open your eyes and it smears rather badly. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because inside of the package, there was a handwritten note with my name on it thanking me for my business.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye makeup! It is easy to apply and makes the best eyebrows for me as mine are thinning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with eye liner as one doesn&#x27;t easily come off, or its just not thick enough. this stuff is amazing. it lasts for days honestly if you&#x27;re lazy like me about taking off your makeup.</li>
    <li> Very nice, smooth gel product, goes on easily.</li>
    <li> Loved it! fell asleep with it on and woke up the next morning and it was not smudged. i&#x27;d buy this again!</li>
    <li> Very Small But In love with it and might but buy another elf cream eyeliner soon. Definitely try this product....!</li>
    <li> I like it. The only thing is that I thought this was liquid eyeliner long lasting. But it serves more as shadow as eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Came in 2 days after I ordered.This eyeliner is lovely &amp; great for the price. Has a nice matte finish &amp; is water proof. Applies smoothly for me and stays in place. The container is small but still worth what I payed.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product! I bought it for my engagement pictures and hope to use it again for the wedding. My wedding is four months away but there is enough product to last until after!&lt;br /&gt;The product is thick so you only need to apply one layer. It comes with an angled brush which makes usage easy. The brush is also makes it easy to navigate around false lashes without loosening/irritating them. Lets face it, you need to apply them before makeup and you only want to attempt it once!&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner stays on so well! My eyes were watering b/c of the sun and the liner did not budge! Just let dry a minute or so after applying and you are good for the whole day and into the night!&lt;br /&gt;It also isn&#x27;t super difficult to remove. I use Coconut Oil to remove my makeup and while it can get a bit messy (raccoon eyes), the liner does come off without lost of clumps and such. I just follow up with a baby wipe and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
    <li> Since i dont like pencil eye liner, this is amazing. It goes on so smooth and you can have small lines or thick lines. I love it and reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyeliner, its soo smooth, goes on great and has a matte look once its dried. I&#x27;m so glad I found it at such a good price online, as I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I bought a bd eyeliner brush as i think the one it comes with is too small, but otherwise, great buy!</li>
    <li> Works great! And gosh it&#x27;s lasting forever! About 6 months now!!</li>
    <li> love this, gives a pretty smoky eye</li>
    <li> This is black and smooth. The brush it comes with is good for applying it but it&#x27;s crap. The bristles are scratchy. But the quality for the price is great! I love using this for a sleek cat eye. I have yet to use it on my waterline as the idea intimidates me but if I ever try it, I&#x27;ll update my review. Make sure to give it a few seconds to dry before you blink or it might smudge a bit.</li>
    <li> This cream eye liner is a lot better that liquid ones because you can draw the line over the eyelid 10 times easier. The consistency is perfect and it comes with the right brush so you won&#x27;t have to make a mess using a wrong one. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream eyeliner for a couple of months and it is a great product for such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used gel liner that comes in a container, but I was able to draw perfect cat eyes with it. It went under my eyes just a little bit, maybe I applied 2 layers but only 1 is needed. Overall I liked it as my first-so-ever REAL gel liner that&#x27;s not contractable gel pencil.</li>
    <li> No smear goes on smooth this is awesome!</li>
    <li> Works great to line my lids with.</li>
    <li> The eye liner was not black enough. It barely showed up on my skin. I&#x27;m surprised it has four stars!!</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is very good , i use it over my bobbie brown gel eyeliner, and it&#x27;s alot darker than it too.</li>
    <li> I am an eyeliner junky.  I have always liked a bold eye.  I generally prefer the richness and convenience of a liquid brush eyeliner (which is getting harder and harder to find a good one), but my old L&#x27;Oreal ran out and does tend to dry too crusty which is annoying, so I am venturing back into the cream eyeliners again.  In the past my complaints about them have been having to carry a brush around with it, and that they dry out too quickly, but if you use it often, I find it dries out less, and if the price is right, I guess it&#x27;s not the worse problem to have (this is true of all water-based smooth products, like gel pens, too).  It&#x27;s much more important to me that it is creamy, goes on smoothly without tugging, doesn&#x27;t get stiff and crusty, washes off easily, and preferably doesn&#x27;t smudge.  For me, this e.l.f. is the best, and for a fraction of the cost of other name brands (Mac/Sephora).  It scores well on all of the above I mentioned, except on the last one.  I would not call it waterproof, and if you sleep in it, it will smudge and you&#x27;ll have a bit of raccoon eyes, but then we shouldn&#x27;t be sleeping in our makeup anyway.  I am also quite sensitive to chemicals, etc. and this product does not make my eyes run or be irritated like some others.  The black is dark and rich.  The blue is a nice cool deep navy, which looks classic and sophisticated, not too young or trendy.  I liked them so much I bought the olive and plum for my sister as gifts.  When mine run out or dry up, I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> For how much i paid for its good. it&#x27;s not as good as Mailbelene but it is a pretty decent gel eye liner</li>
    <li> This is my second time order the same product, obviously I love it. When I ran out again I will buy another one. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love! Stays on all day</li>
    <li> Ok this eyeliner is perfect, not only does this not smudge but it looks great. I have been looking for an eyeliner that does not smudge and ladies I found it. It works great, I have been looking for years and I have found the one liner. Love it. Trust me it works, well at least for me it has.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on smoothly. It&#x27;s creamy and it makes a really thin line with the brush. I really like it and it went on quickly too.</li>
    <li> I have bought several of these liquid eye liners in many different colors.  I absolutely love them!! They last a very, very long time.  Looks great behind a set a falsies!!  Highly recommend seller!</li>
    <li> This is a great product but its kind of hared to put on. you just have to take your time while putting it on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfect gel liner and I finally found it. I gave it a 4 star because the angled eyeliner brush is very small and it sucks.. I recommend using your own angled eyeliner brush..</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! It takes a few minutes for the cream to dry so if you mess up you have plenty of time to get it corrected.  I like the brush it comes with too. It makes it easy to hide the white dots on false lashes by dabbing the cream at the base of the lashes. Once it&#x27;s dried, it really stays until you are ready to wash it off! My allergies had my eyes constantly watering at the outer corners today and the makeup was not affected at all! Will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this eye liner which was super affordable and It came in the mail very fast. The eyeliner itself is easy to apply and stays on for hours. Thank you!</li>
    <li> And I will never buy this product ever again. and yes - I did and do keep the lid on (I&#x27;ve used Bobbi Brown gel eyeliner for years) - it just does not matter. The product is just plain less quality.</li>
    <li> Very good eyeliner! I love elf products and this is very smooth and creamy and certainly does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> My step-daughter swears by this eyeliner, so I brought one to try for myself. This is very nice, smooth, comes with a small applying brush, and has a beautiful finish. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> it was the opposite of what it said. its trash not worth a dime  had to go out and buy something that worked</li>
    <li> I am a repeat user of this product for years. I used to use Mac&#x27;s black gel liner (almost identical to this), granted MAC&#x27;s product was blacker and more pigmented, it was also A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE. As an everyday item for me, I am happy enough with this, and it looks great for everyday use. Additionally, you can find similar products in the drug store, but it costs 2-3 x more still... and then there&#x27;s the Mac version, which is 6-8x more, Shiseido has one too, that&#x27;s even more expensive than Mac and it is less pigmented than ELF&#x27;s. So I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!! Won&#x27;t use any other eye liner now</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great although it clumps a little bit but that&#x27;s nothing to worry about. I don&#x27;t know much about makeup but e.l.f. seems to be pretty good quality.</li>
    <li> I loved this eyeliner! It came super fast! I also loved it because I am new to gel liner and this was very easy to use. It went on super creamy and was a great jet black color. A plus for me is the bottle it came in was super cute!</li>
    <li> Smooth application.  Long lasting. Great color.  I love it.</li>
    <li> It is water proof and still buttery enough to get a smooth line. I like that its soo pigmented that I dont have to go over it a second time.</li>
    <li> This smeared horribly on me.  At least I was cheap but it was like throwing money away.  I&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
    <li> it really goes on smooth you just have to know how to use the brush. the only problem would be that it takes a lot to get it to come off when you want to remove.</li>
    <li> Wears well ,and stays on good</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner, and I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner. It goes on smooth and precise with the brush it comes with and doesn&#x27;t smudge and smear like others i have used but if you do want to smudge it for a smokey eye you will need to do that after applying before it dries. *clean your brush after use*</li>
    <li> I was really optimistic about this product because elf usually has pretty decent stuff. I use my own liner brush (the one it comes with is fine but a little thick for me) and it looks perfect when I first put it on. I only do my upper lash line but within half an hour it starts smudging. Then about an hour later I notice it sort of runs and ends up under my eyes. The fine line you make with it ends up really blurry. I really wish it had more waterproof power but oh well. I was thinking maybe I got a dud package or something, I&#x27;m not sure. I think this product is good if you&#x27;re just going out for an hour or two, or if you can touch up often. Otherwise it&#x27;s not the best, but it&#x27;s alright for being a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is better than I expected at this price. It goes perfectly on the little brush it comes with and I really like it. :)</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this eyeliner &amp; I love it ! Before I was using Maybelline&#x27;s studio eyeliner from Fergie&#x27;s line and it was so hard and difficult to put on. The e.l.f studio cream eyeliner is smooth and gives a great finish !</li>
    <li> Excellent eye liner! Doesn&#x27;t come off easy and it last up to 6 hours</li>
    <li> I love gel liner so much! It&#x27;s a lot easier to apply than liquid liner, and lasts longer than pencil liner. This particular one was simple to put on and comes with its own applicatior brush. The color lasts me well and, unlike other reviews I&#x27;ve read, my eyeliner hasn&#x27;t dried up. I imagine those that this has happened to, failed to replace the top on the container after each use. I have had mine for months now and it is still just as potent as it was when I first got it.</li>
    <li> Love e.l.f. products!!</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner. Easy to use,smudge proof. Nice crisp line without the harsh look of liquid eyeliner. Great little angled brush too.</li>
    <li> It went on well and I liked using it, but the eyeliner dried up within a week.</li>
    <li> This eye liner is great in that it goes on really smoothly and is very easy to apply. It also is very pigmented so you only need one swipe and you are all set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like is that this eyeliner is very prone to smudging and bleeding. I would only have it on for an hour before noticing it had bled into my crease and started to come off on the corners of my eyes. This wasn&#x27;t from touching my eyes or anything but was a regular occurrence from everyday wear. When I tried doing a subtle cat eye, this eye liner did not hold up and the cat eye looked like a big blob after a day a work. Also, if your eyes water even a little bit it will totally noticeably run this liquid liner, which is a bummer if you have allergies or it is windy/rainy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase again, wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Waterproof and smug-proof. It last all day. Nice Dark color. Plan on buying more when i run out.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product was cheap&lt;br /&gt;ive bought elf before, but I was very disappointed. Very gunky. and dried out way to fast. I left it slightly open one day before school, and when I got home it was cracking already:(&lt;br /&gt;not worth it</li>
    <li> I have used e.l.f. gel eyeliner for a year now. I am very pleased with it performance. It glides on smoothly and drys quickly lasting all day.</li>
    <li> i got this product finally...came in at the right time and pretty early...i tot it would be congealed like a stone wen it came but amazingly its is in perfect condition. i use it to line my everyday since i got it and it has definitely added a boom to my tiny slit eyes.....am glad i made this buy.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cream eyeliner ever! The brush that it comes with is a joke, but I am going to assume that anyone that is using cream eyeliner likely already has a good liner brush. It goes on smooth, lasts all day, even survives my inevitable rubbing my eyes out of stress :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s both creamy and smooth; great for beginners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See a tutorial using this eyeliner by YouTube searching uofglambyak&lt;br /&gt;Awesome Eyeliner Tutorial for Beginners, explains ALOT!</li>
    <li> This liner ended up all over my eyelids in just a few hours. I even used primer.</li>
    <li> The brush they give you is flimsy. Mine wasn&#x27;t even inside the eyeliner package, so the brush hairs were completely ruined. Now, I have to spend extra money to find a decent brush for this eyeliner. Also, this eyeliner does NOT glide on well, even with primer. So, if you want to do winged/cat eyes, I suggest to use another brand of cream eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner ever!  All of my adult life I have tried every kind of eyeliners on my lower lid..... Pencil, gel, liquid, cake... Inexpensive and expensive. They ALWAYS smeared, smudged, or disappeared. This is the only eyeliner that stays on all day, and doesn&#x27;t give me that raccoon look. I highly recommend. Elf products are great.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great seller, I love the product, packing was nice &amp; neat. The liner goes on so smooth &amp; really last long &amp; stays on until I wash it off. Will be purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> It dried out after the first time I used it. Its really cheap so it makes sense that you get a cheap product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t dislike this product nor love it but its ok. It stains and the brush is too small</li>
    <li> i loved it, but unfortunately i didn&#x27;t get the brush brush</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff from Target on halloween when they were sold out of all their costume makeup. This ended up being my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; eyeliner. You can get perfect lines, seems to hold longer then most of my liquid eyeliners do as well. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is everything an eyeliner should be: dark in one application, creamy, easy to work with and long-lasting. I&#x27;ve repurchased this item. I can still use my old one, although it has dried up a bit (purchased two years ago). I find it easier to use with an angled eyeliner brush, but the tiny brush it comes with is also workable, just make sure not to load it too much, otherwise you&#x27;ll get no color from the tip of the brush and two parallel black lines from the edges. I have super-watery eyes and it times, after extended wear, it can smudge a little bit under the eye, but nothing dramatic. I&#x27;ll keep buying this!</li>
    <li> At first this product was great and went on smoothly. It&#x27;s also really easy to apply. But after 2 weeks the cream hardened and now I can barely use it.</li>
    <li> This came well before it was originally supposed to arrive. I love this makeup and the ease of use. It makes me look absolutely stunning and stays on all night. I am so impressed with this seller, she even wrote me a note thanking me, I highly reccomend this and I will definetly buy again!</li>
