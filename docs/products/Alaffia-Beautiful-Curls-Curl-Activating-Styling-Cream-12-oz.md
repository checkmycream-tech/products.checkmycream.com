### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was so impressed.</li>
      <li>Works wonderfully with my curly hair, I also use the shampoo and leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>This one is perfect.</li>
      <li>I am beginning to feel that with great products like these out there, some day I may no longer have to use any texturizing chemicals in my hair at all to get a nice curly look!!</li>
      <li>I purchased an 8oz jar of the Beautiful Curls about 5 moths ago</li>
      <li>Just settle for the Beautiful Curls Gel Curl Defining Shea Butter For Wavy To Curly Hair.</li>
      <li>I have used this product twice now for my two strand twist out and have had great results.</li>
      <li>I think that it is great for Afro-textured hair.</li>
      <li>whichever the case may be, and it smells great.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>Good for children&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>it made my hair smell really good after my wash.</li>
      <li>so you can feel good about giving them your dollars.  </li>
      <li>has loved this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I love this product line!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Given that, it is at best ironic, that phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in vaccines.</li>
      <li>Works best when hair is slightly wet and is great fr twist.</li>
      <li>Best part is t s all natural.</li>
      <li>If many people would complain, they would probably take it out.&lt;br /&gt;See</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>The MSDS refers to 100% concentrations, so is it safe at lower doses?</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>However, since the cream does a better job of moisturizing my hair than the tonic, I&#x27;ve given this 4 stars.</li>
      <li>Phenoxyethanol was in the top 10.</li>
      <li>so I started to explore more products with Shea butter.</li>
      <li>and once you take out the twists, it holds the curl for more than a week.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this prodct.</li>
      <li>If you are twisting your hair with this product after washing, it gives the hair a healthy glow</li>
      <li>I find that the cream has similar properties to Beautiful Curls&#x27; Curl Reviving Tonic, except that I believe it leaves my hair a littler softer and suppler than the tonic.  </li>
      <li>She has fine</li>
      <li>Great product that contains overall wholesome ingredients.</li>
      <li>Phenol can disable the immune system&#x27;s primary response mechanism.</li>
      <li>Thank you Alaffia for making a product that works with my hair and thanks to all the people who write reviews on here which helped to lead me to this amazing styling cream.</li>
      <li>It is a good conditioner, it makes the hair soft, it defines the curl or the wave,</li>
      <li>She suggested I use this in conjunction with Kinky Curly Original Curling Custard</li>
      <li>Hopefully I will see nice soft curly hair in the morning.</li>
      <li>To show how good this product is, it defined my curls even after I washed my hair twice the same morning to get the Shea Moisture Coconut Hibuscus Smoothie out of it leaving my hair looking all lifeless and untreated.</li>
      <li>I am SO happy with the Beautiful Curls and Kinky Curly combination, that I have quit on my fancy, more expensive Bumble and Bumble products, which were neither natural nor organic.  </li>
      <li>I had hoped to find a natural alternative that I could live with, but found one that I am thrilled with in these products!</li>
      <li>No animal testing, cruelty free &amp; a portion of your dollars will go towards charities worthy of supporting.</li>
      <li>Very nice results, and a high social awareness component</li>
      <li>It left my curls soft and defined it beautifully.</li>
      <li>Its great for coiled to tight coiled hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The product&#x27;s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) says that it phenoxyethanol is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage.</li>
      <li>I guess it didn&#x27;t work on mine because I have kinky curly hair, overall it is great with natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I like this product quite a bit, but am still open to finding better substitutes.  </li>
      <li>Just purchased my first tube at a local organic store and I love it.</li>
      <li>I thought this was a miracle product the first week.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve sampled it out to a few curly haired girlfriends, who have also loved it.  </li>
      <li>Be sure you still look at youtube for all kind affalia hair products before ordering, so you will know if thin or creamy works for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this product its actually great its the only product that makes my hair soft combined with the leave and actually tames it</li>
      <li>I will certainly be buying it here on amazon as they seem to run out of it a lot at the health food store.</li>
      <li>It is very great.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I just bought a bottle of this from Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair with a soft, non-frizzy hold!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had less breakage and more shine and body.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>and I have about a month&#x27;s worth left.  </li>
      <li>but while I read some other negative reviews about that product someone referenced the Alaffia Beautiful Curls Shea Butter Defining Cream.</li>
      <li>I am usually not a person to promote products because I prefer just shampoo and oil on my hair</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>I could see the curls activating and defining from the very first dab that I put on my wet hair.</li>
      <li>However, a 1990 article in the Journal of the American College of Toxicology said that it was only a mild irritant to rabbit skin at 2%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just purchased this product at a well known natural product store.</li>
      <li>I have to admit that it makes my hair crunchy when it dries which I actually love because at least I know that it&#x27;s providing a hold.</li>
      <li>I would reccomend this if you you are looking for a product that  is composed of natural ingredients and helps hold a natural curl.</li>
      <li>Aubrey Organics - Island Natural Conditioner, 11 fl oz liquid]](both of which I&#x27;ve been using for over 5 years.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft either way I style it.</li>
      <li>I went to my local Whole Foods immediately to buy it, but either they didn&#x27;t have it</li>
      <li>I clean-shaved my hair for years but decided to grow it out and have been having a challenge dealing with the natural kinks.</li>
      <li>I discovered this in a Natural foods store and it is moisturizing as well as offering hold control for my frizzy prone hair!&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have a chemical relaxer in your hair and you like the natural look, then you would like this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a black guy, pretty new to products.</li>
      <li>its also very soft and only semi-thick.</li>
      <li>I, with my long-ish, fine, curly European hair was at the local whole/natural food and stuff store and asked the only other curly-haired woman in the beauty section if she had any products to recommend.  </li>
      <li>also came across a report written by a medical professional who contracted allergies after coming into contact with phenoxyethanol in a detergent used for cleaning lab equipment.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in it.  </li>
      <li>Not only did it make my hair soft and curly</li>
      <li>It does not dry out the hair and in fact keeps it moist.</li>
      <li>I would only reccomde it for ppl with thin fine hair.</li>

<li> In cosmetics the concentrations are typically 0.5% to 1%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several animal studies that demonstrate that it is toxic - with effects on the brain and the nervous system - at moderate concentrations.</li>

<li> She had soft, curly, thick African hair and said that she loves this stuff and every curly-haired woman(regardless of ethnicity)</li>
<li> For the past few months, I&#x27;ve been using the cream and tonic together, but I find that over use of the products can actually have the unintended effect of making my kinky, natural hair feel dry and coarse.  </li>
<li> The large \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; conditioner (the one that is very hard finding) with vanilla smelling is made with unrefine shea butter.</li>
<li> By the second week, my hair was sticky and stiff.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve spent over $400 on hair products from gels to creams to pomades!</li>
<li> Unlike other reviewers this has not left my hair with any icky build up.</li>
<li> When I use the one for so-called Kinky hair it left my scalp  itchy and icky, and I just washed my hair.</li>
<li> /&gt;Phenoxyethanol breaks down to phenol and acetaldehyde, acetaldehyde converts to acetate.</li>
<li> Then I layer on the Kinky Curly, which I slightly dilute with water.  </li>
<li> Maybe a 1/4 teaspoon or even less for my hair.  </li>
<li> I used the coordinating shampoo and conditioner and my hair was a tangled, sticky mess all of the time.  </li>
<li> Non-animal tested and relatively toxin-free -- and it works (making curls out of frizz) -- but the packaging is frustrating.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a black guy, pretty new to products. I clean-shaved my hair for years but decided to grow it out and have been having a challenge dealing with the natural kinks. I&#x27;ve spent over $400 on hair products from gels to creams to pomades! Of late, I started noticing that Shea butter works well with my extremely course, dry, fine and kinky hair texture so I started to explore more products with Shea butter. I checked out Shea Moisture&#x27;s Coconut Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie and it was a disaster... that thing just weighed down my hair and made it look dead and cold but while I read some other negative reviews about that product someone referenced the Alaffia Beautiful Curls Shea Butter Defining Cream. I went to my local Whole Foods immediately to buy it, but either they didn&#x27;t have it or I missed it (I get confused by all the product names sometimes), but I brought this home (the Alaffia Curl Activating Styling Cream) and immediately applied it. No product has ever worked as miraculously for my very short curls as this. I was so impressed. I could see the curls activating and defining from the very first dab that I put on my wet hair. To show how good this product is, it defined my curls even after I washed my hair twice the same morning to get the Shea Moisture Coconut Hibuscus Smoothie out of it leaving my hair looking all lifeless and untreated. Immediately upon applying, this product brought life to my hair and defined the curls so well it looked almost as if I had just texturized my hair. I was pleasantly surprised! I have to admit that it makes my hair crunchy when it dries which I actually love because at least I know that it&#x27;s providing a hold. I&#x27;m in love with this product! Thank you Alaffia for making a product that works with my hair and thanks to all the people who write reviews on here which helped to lead me to this amazing styling cream. I am beginning to feel that with great products like these out there, some day I may no longer have to use any texturizing chemicals in my hair at all to get a nice curly look!! This product is amazing! I will certainly be buying it here on amazon as they seem to run out of it a lot at the health food store.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get fooled by the labels, this is not great for Kinky hair. Just settle for the Beautiful Curls Gel Curl Defining Shea Butter For Wavy To Curly Hair. When I use the one for so-called Kinky hair it left my scalp  itchy and icky, and I just washed my hair. You can try for yourself.</li>
    <li> I just bought a bottle of this from Whole Foods. I noticed that the Alaffia people have added phenoxyethanol to this product. It did not&lt;br /&gt;used to be in curl reviving tonic. I am surprised and disappointed that they put it in. It is known to be toxic. I wrote the company and told&lt;br /&gt;them my feelings about this. If many people would complain, they would probably take it out.&lt;br /&gt;See the following for a commentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol is a glycol ether. Glycols are a series of chemicals that find their way into all sorts of things: paint, lacquer, jet fuel..... Phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in cosmetics as well as a stabilizer in perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) says that it phenoxyethanol is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The MSDS refers to 100% concentrations, so is it safe at lower doses? In cosmetics the concentrations are typically 0.5% to 1%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several animal studies that demonstrate that it is toxic - with effects on the brain and the nervous system - at moderate concentrations. In Japan, there is a concentration limit for its use in cosmetics. In Europe, the European Union classifies it as an irritant and there are various studies (on rabbit skin, for example) that demonstrate reactions at low doses. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) data sheets show chromosomal changes and genetic mutation effects in testing as well as testicular atrophy and interference with reproductivity in mice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also came across a report written by a medical professional who contracted allergies after coming into contact with phenoxyethanol in a detergent used for cleaning lab equipment. It seems he wasn&#x27;t a fluke. There are over 3,000 known allergans and they were studied, along with the data from 9,948 patients, by a research team in Germany. Phenoxyethanol was in the top 10. An Italian study also determined that phenoxyethanol is a contact allergan. However, a 1990 article in the Journal of the American College of Toxicology said that it was only a mild irritant to rabbit skin at 2%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concern that phenoxyethanol is a neurotoxin precedes the FDA. German research in 1999, concluded that it had neurotoxin potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol breaks down to phenol and acetaldehyde, acetaldehyde converts to acetate. Phenol can disable the immune system&#x27;s primary response mechanism. Given that, it is at best ironic, that phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in vaccines. Acetaldehyde occurs during the breakdown of ethanol, (alchohol and 2-phenoxyETHANOL), it is a suspected carcinogen. Inhalation studies have shown irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a miracle product the first week.  By the second week, my hair was sticky and stiff.  I used the coordinating shampoo and conditioner and my hair was a tangled, sticky mess all of the time.  It&#x27;s taken several weeks to remove the build-up.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice now for my two strand twist out and have had great results. It leaves my hair with a soft, non-frizzy hold!!! I have tried Darcy&#x27;s Twist cream and it was too heavy and greasy for my hair! This one is perfect. I think my hair is 4 b/c ?!? its also very soft and only semi-thick. Unlike other reviewers this has not left my hair with any icky build up. I love it! I may have to get the shampoo and conditioner next!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product at a well known natural product store. I absolutely love it. It left my curls soft and defined it beautifully. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this prodct. Its great for coiled to tight coiled hair. Works best when hair is slightly wet and is great fr twist. Actually gives hair lots of moisture and it is not slippery or greasy. Best part is t s all natural.</li>
    <li> I am sorry I have to disagree with most of the people on here who had a bad review for this product its actually great its the only product that makes my hair soft combined with the leave and actually tames it I have tried aveda which i only use for a big blown out fro and miss jessies just doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my curls. My hair is 3c and adore this product because it does not make my hair dry.</li>
    <li> I, with my long-ish, fine, curly European hair was at the local whole/natural food and stuff store and asked the only other curly-haired woman in the beauty section if she had any products to recommend.  She had soft, curly, thick African hair and said that she loves this stuff and every curly-haired woman(regardless of ethnicity) has loved this.  She suggested I use this in conjunction with Kinky Curly Original Curling Custard [[ASIN:B00127C83M Kinky Curly Curling Custard 16 oz]](but just a teeny bit for my hair).  I put on this product(Beautiful Curls) after towel drying and combing my hair.  Then I use a pick to loosen it up and tousle it.  Then I layer on the Kinky Curly, which I slightly dilute with water.  Maybe a 1/4 teaspoon or even less for my hair.  I purchased an 8oz jar of the Beautiful Curls about 5 moths ago and I have about a month&#x27;s worth left.  The Kinky Curly...well I got a 16oz jar in April 2011 and I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in it.  And I&#x27;ve sampled it out to a few curly haired girlfriends, who have also loved it.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even used 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for over a year, I&#x27;ve been using this combo.  I wash and condition my hair 2 times per week.  For washing, I use Aubrey Organics GPB Shampoo [[ASIN:B0043HSL98 Aubrey Organics - Gpb Shampoo, 11 fl oz cream]]and Aubrey Organics Island Naturals Conditioner[[ASIN:B0006GZC4W Aubrey Organics - Island Natural Conditioner, 11 fl oz liquid]](both of which I&#x27;ve been using for over 5 years.  Some breaks to try other stuff, but I always come back to the Aubrey Organics Island Naturals and GPB lines).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had less breakage and more shine and body.  I am SO happy with the Beautiful Curls and Kinky Curly combination, that I have quit on my fancy, more expensive Bumble and Bumble products, which were neither natural nor organic.  I had hoped to find a natural alternative that I could live with, but found one that I am thrilled with in these products!</li>
    <li> I love this product line!  Very nice results, and a high social awareness component so you can feel good about giving them your dollars.  No animal testing, cruelty free &amp; a portion of your dollars will go towards charities worthy of supporting.</li>
    <li> I discovered this in a Natural foods store and it is moisturizing as well as offering hold control for my frizzy prone hair!&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent that isn&#x27;t going to give you a headache-Love this product line</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have a chemical relaxer in your hair and you like the natural look, then you would like this.  It is a good conditioner, it makes the hair soft, it defines the curl or the wave, whichever the case may be, and it smells great.  I love it.  Good for children&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I am usually not a person to promote products because I prefer just shampoo and oil on my hair but I decided to try this product. I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews. I think that it is great for Afro-textured hair.It does not dry out the hair and in fact keeps it moist. If you are twisting your hair with this product after washing, it gives the hair a healthy glow and once you take out the twists, it holds the curl for more than a week. Great product that contains overall wholesome ingredients. I would reccomend this if you you are looking for a product that  is composed of natural ingredients and helps hold a natural curl.</li>
    <li> Find another product leaves the hair a bit tough after application and the pic shows a jar it came in tube medium size</li>
    <li> Just purchased my first tube at a local organic store and I love it. Not only did it make my hair soft and curly it made my hair smell really good after my wash. Hopefully I will see nice soft curly hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> It is extermly \\&quot;watery\\&quot; and thin. I would only reccomde it for ppl with thin fine hair. I guess it didn&#x27;t work on mine because I have kinky curly hair, overall it is great with natural ingredients. Look at youtube how Affalia is made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would keep ordering a lot of Affalia hair products even thru it expensive, i know why it is pricey. Some is made with unrefined. It is very great.&lt;br /&gt; The large \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; conditioner (the one that is very hard finding) with vanilla smelling is made with unrefine shea butter. It creamy too. Be sure you still look at youtube for all kind affalia hair products before ordering, so you will know if thin or creamy works for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I must have thick creamy (just like Shea Enchancing Moisture) to work with my texture. it will help get thru my thick hair and hydrate better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappionted that I wasted a lot money in activation cream during to thin watery, I gave to ma instead. She has fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Not all AFFALIA is watery , only activation cream</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully with my curly hair, I also use the shampoo and leave-in conditioner. I need a lot of conditioner to make my hair look alright.</li>
    <li> not riht for my hair. thaks.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been using these products for years. They work for curly hair and when I straighten my hair.  Leaves my hair soft either way I style it.</li>
    <li> I like this product quite a bit, but am still open to finding better substitutes.  I find that the cream has similar properties to Beautiful Curls&#x27; Curl Reviving Tonic, except that I believe it leaves my hair a littler softer and suppler than the tonic.  For the past few months, I&#x27;ve been using the cream and tonic together, but I find that over use of the products can actually have the unintended effect of making my kinky, natural hair feel dry and coarse.  However, since the cream does a better job of moisturizing my hair than the tonic, I&#x27;ve given this 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Non-animal tested and relatively toxin-free -- and it works (making curls out of frizz) -- but the packaging is frustrating. Owing to the consistency, it is hard to squirt out and close without spilling what&#x27;s in the palm...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It curls your hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
