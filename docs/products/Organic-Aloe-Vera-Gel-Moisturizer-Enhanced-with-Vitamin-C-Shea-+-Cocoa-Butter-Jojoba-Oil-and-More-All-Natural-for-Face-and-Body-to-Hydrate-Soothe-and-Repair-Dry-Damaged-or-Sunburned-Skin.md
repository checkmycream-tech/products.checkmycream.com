<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I just got this product and I love it! First of all it was enormous, and second it is made up of completely natural ingredients. I have very sensitive skin and the winter weather dries it out completely. This product immediately moisturized my skin immediately, and it lasted a very long time! I use it night and wake up with glowing skin. Gone is the itchy redness. I am completely sold! You will only know how good it is if you use it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Non-greasy, very moisturizing and absorbs quickly.  Safe and natural ingredients make the product that much better!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  It is light weight and the natural fragrance is very subtle.  The 9oz tube is a generous portion, so I have been using it not only on my face and neck, but also my arms and hands.  This is a great sheer, lightweight everyday moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Dad who has very dry winter skin. It has really helped him</li>
    <li> Really love this product works great</li>
    <li> Love this product. I received it couple days ago and start using it. It makes my skin feels very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I first used this product as a sample and loved it.</li>
    <li> I have been hiding this moisturizer for a couple of days. It doe  not have any smell to it. When you first open it, it looks like cottage cheese. Very light formula, almost like a gel like consistency. A little goes a long way.  It is very moisturizing. Feels good and light on the skin in. I received this moisturizer at a discounted rate to review, with that bridesmaid this is an honest review.</li>

My dry skin on my feet has all but gone away andmy grandson&#x27;s itchy dry skin has finally stopped itching.  I was given this product for my honest review.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my skin feel smooth and nourished. Great for a sunburn. I was offered this product at a discount in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Love love this. Makes everything feel Wonderful</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a small jar of this lotion to try it out and see if I liked it before buying the big jar.  I usually use the unscented Vaseline lotion because it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.  After reading about this product and the ingredients vs. Vaseline, I had to give it a try.  Dynamic Aloe leaves me feeling moisturized without the greasy residue and being unscented doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies nor anyone else around me.  I will definitely be making the switch and purchasing only the big jars for all my future purchases!!! :-)</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a bit gelatinous which I&#x27;ll assume is from the aloe and maybe needs to be stirred? It does moisturize well, but once it&#x27;s absorbed, it flakes.</li>
    <li> Honestly this is the best cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dry flaky skin under my eyes on my cheeks forever and nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;I never went to the doctor but I assume it was eczema or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;After one use my skin was smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply after every shower, before i go to bed and once or twice during the day.  It honestly makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great skin cream, I definitely recommend this Dynamic Aloe Organic Aloe Vera Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I use this as an all over body gel.. I live in the desert and dryness is a real factor. I slop this on and rub it in. Seems to work better that the bottled body lotions.</li>
    <li> I really love how light this is.  Love it on my face under my makeup!  Feel hydrated and not greasy!&lt;br /&gt;Chery Reeves</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is simply the best!  We live in Arizona and we know &amp;#34;DRY&amp;#34; !!  On a scale from 1-10 we give it a 20 !!</li>
    <li> This is a thick product but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on skin. A little goes a long way! I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate it at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer ever since I got it last week and I am so happy that I don&#x27;t have any dry spots anymore. The change is definitely noticeable.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it works GREAT !!! It leaves your skin very soft with no grease to to try to wash off. its all natural and is absorbed really quickly. i can put on the cream then use a screwdriver and have no problems with my hand slipping. the moisture from the cream lasts for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough for an accurate review. However I like the water base it goes on very smooth and dries quickly. My skin feels great not greasy like many other moisturizers. Am quite happy with my purchase and will look for other products in that line.</li>
    <li> Very sticky and i don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, doesn&#x27;t sit on top of your skin.  I use this everyday on my face, hands and body.  Great for sunburns!</li>
    <li> no smell at all, I like it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is so much better than I expected!  I love the list of all natural and organic ingredients. It glides on and is absorbed quickly with no greasy residue.  My skin was much improved after one application. Wonderful that there is no fragrance!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a reduced price in exchange for my honest feedback. My feedback is &#x27;WOW&#x27;. I hate a greasy feel after lotions or moisturizers, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that AT ALL. It just leaves your skin amazingly soft. No fragrance which I like too. This is a keeper and will be buying again. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Dynamic Aloe. I spend a lot of time outdoors so tend to have dry skin; this moisturizer absorbs well and hydrates my skin without feeling greasy. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer cream. My skin feels very soft and smooth. Best one I have come across and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> The texture of the cream is a bit weird to me at first but easy to glide on the skin, not greasy at all and makes skin feels really smooth afterwards. I like it that it doesn&#x27;t have any scent or weird odor. The jar is big so I can use alot and not feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> I used this on my face and it absorbed so quickly without residue.  I love it!!  I am currently using it on a scab and it works wonders!</li>
    <li> I used this cream to help a terrible heat rash on my husband&#x27;s back!  It absorbs very nicely and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance means less chemicals so it&#x27;s healthier!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the way Dynamic Aloe rejuvenates my dry skin.  I work in construction where I&#x27;m always exposed to harsh chemicals and dry porous materials.  I like the way it goes on and goes on without that &amp;#34;greasy stays on top of your skin feeling&amp;#34; that other lotions seem to have.  I just put it on, rub it a little bit and forget about it. No rash and no dry skin! I really like the way it doesn&#x27;t have a perfumey smell too.  I am really glad I found this cream.  It really works!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it is all natural and organic ingredients. It absorbed quickly with no greasy feeling on skin.</li>
    <li> Nice large size.  Don&#x27;t look for super smooth creamy texture, but this stuff delivers.  Who cares what it looks like when you open the jar anyway?  It all gets rubbed into your skin so it shouldn&#x27;t matter (I could care less).  Use it pretty much everywhere except my face.  Love it.</li>
    <li> great product as advertised</li>
