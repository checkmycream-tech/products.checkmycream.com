      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>The aroma is great and is is good for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Loved this soap from the first time I used and smelled it.  </li>
      <li>A Maja gift set makes a unique and memorable gift.</li>
      <li>Very mild.</li>
      <li>When he died I took leftover bars and liked them so much, I continued to buy them in the U.S.  </li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t available in the states.  </li>
      <li>If you like the scent of sandelwood with a kick, you will enjoy this.</li>
      <li>these soaps are the best soaps and very well traditional soaps from spain.</li>
      <li>It may have been around for a long time but still great.</li>
      <li>Love Maja, when I first had the product my husband brought it to me from Spain</li>
      <li>that had the original scent.)  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to have found these for her recent birthday and the price is right.</li>
      <li>This version smells good, but  as soon as I started unwrapping a bar, I noticed a scent that is thinner, sharper---not as rich and deep as what I&#x27;ve been accustomed to.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a fair price and the bars last quite a while.</li>
      <li>Lovely old fashioned scent.</li>
      <li>I love the soft scent, the price it is just right.</li>
      <li>Though advertised for women, the scent is definitely heterosexual - suitable for men and women.</li>
      <li>First found at a Merle Norman in Atlanta, and have been &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; ever since.</li>
      <li>and I love it when I open my linen closet to find that fragrance permeating everything!  </li>
      <li>But someone who has never smelled the older version would never know!  </li>
      <li>You get real value for your money with Maja products.  </li>
      <li>I also have given it as gifts, and they are appreciated.</li>
      <li>the round large ones - 3 of 4.9 ounces each in a package of 3 if you are looking for a better price per ounce.</li>
      <li>In these troubled times, enjoying a quality soap is a welcome little luxury.  </li>
      <li>Nothing says &amp;#34;I have class&amp;#34; better than offering a lady a gift of a few bars of Maja.  </li>
      <li>I leave a few wrapped bars around house and give them to visitors as small welcome  and thanks for stopping by gifts.  </li>
      <li>Favorite soap for the past years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely shop again for more for other gift giving occasions.</li>
      <li>This is an old soap that has been around forever...</li>
      <li>but no longer get that far south.</li>
      <li>I am alergic to nearly all fragrances but this soap I can use.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s exactly the same as the Spanish version!</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers, I was concerned about the new packaging (the shipped item wasn&#x27;t as pictured), but it seems to be the same product as before.</li>

<li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is amazing, the scent is so refreshing and you don&#x27;t want to close the shower and keep going with this bar soap till is gone! Love it</li>
    <li> This is not a 9.45 Ounce soap bar it is actually a 3.2 ounce. I am dissapointed, I do like the product my wife likes it too.</li>
    <li> Maja Soap made in Mexico??????  I want Maja Soap made in Spain!!!!.  I want to change this Soap made in Mexico for Maja Soap MADE IN SPAIN!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite soaps. Hard to find. If you like the scent of sandelwood with a kick, you will enjoy this. Beautifully made.</li>
    <li> Its the soap my mom likes, I got it for her birthday , she loves it .</li>
    <li> My favorite soap, for many years, and I&#x27;m so glad I can get it through Amazon.  Like other reviewers, I was concerned about the new packaging (the shipped item wasn&#x27;t as pictured), but it seems to be the same product as before.</li>
    <li> after 40 years of being reviewed by my ...husband - this is the best soap - wonderful &amp; unique smell that last!</li>
    <li> Though the soap was sold as a product of Myrurgia, a product of Spain, it is not and was made in Mexico.  It is a different soap and has a different odor.  Had I know if was not by Myrurgia and was made in Mexico, I would not have bought it.  The picture of the soap depicted shows the name Myrurgia on the individual packages of soap; however, the soap which was received does not have the name Myrurgia on the individual packages or on the box, or anywhere else.  This is false advertising, pure and simple.</li>
    <li> II got a  little carried away when I found this soap.... But boy, does my bathroom smell heavenly !&lt;br /&gt;I  have  little bread and butter,and hostess gifts covered for the next ten or twenty years.....</li>
    <li> Use this soap since childhood</li>
    <li> I have been using Maja Soap for about 40 years, and still it&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; I can tolerate. It makes my bathroom smell nice, I put it in drawers so my clothing smells good - and it&#x27;s long-lasting, good for the skin, and I was so happy to find it again online. Could not find it in Macon, Ga. any more. First found at a Merle Norman in Atlanta, and have been &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; ever since. I also have given it as gifts, and they are appreciated.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift  and she was very happy</li>
    <li> If you have never heard of or tried Maja soap and products you are in for a treat. Nothing says &amp;#34;I have class&amp;#34; better than offering a lady a gift of a few bars of Maja.  Besides it smelling heavenly and lathering superbly, the box and wrapping themselves are miniature works of art.  I leave a few wrapped bars around house and give them to visitors as small welcome  and thanks for stopping by gifts.  Shows you have taste. In these troubled times, enjoying a quality soap is a welcome little luxury.  A Maja gift set makes a unique and memorable gift. You will not be disappointed. You get real value for your money with Maja products.  I have been giving them (do not use them, I am a MAN) now for over 45 years.  Now that is a track record.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Brazil, and I don&#x27;t know why we don&#x27;t have this soap there anymore! The thing is, it reminds me when I was a kid, and my grandma LOVES this soap, when I was leaving Brazil to come to US she asked me if I could find this soap for her, so when I found this on Amazon, you can imagine how happy I was! Got 4 boxes and I wish I could get way more!</li>
    <li> Love Maja, when I first had the product my husband brought it to me from Spain and it wasn&#x27;t available in the states.  I missed it for years cuz he didn&#x27;t go back as it was a military stop for him.</li>
    <li> Product is consistent with what I have used in past,  It is not readily available in our area so only option for me was to get it through mail order.</li>
    <li> Love Maja. My mother used this soap and every time I use it, I am reminded of her. Love the smell. It may have been around for a long time but still great.</li>
    <li> I love the soft scent, the price it is just right.</li>
    <li> Best soap at a great price</li>
    <li> Loved this soap from the first time I used and smelled it.  I think this is a fair price and the bars last quite a while.</li>
    <li> gift for mom..lovely scent</li>
    <li> My father used this soap for decades. When he died I took leftover bars and liked them so much, I continued to buy them in the U.S.  A few years ago we started spending winters in Mexico. Imagine my surprise to find it sold in our town at a good price. I didn&#x27;t realize it was made in Mexico, but it doesn&#x27;t surprise me. And it&#x27;s exactly the same as the Spanish version! Though advertised for women, the scent is definitely heterosexual - suitable for men and women.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it is wonderful. The aroma is great and is is good for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Lovely old fashioned scent.</li>
    <li> Favorite soap for the past years.  Not overpowering yet present and discrete.</li>
    <li> Perfect product and hasn&#x27;t changed from when I first used it 40 years ago! Can&#x27;t improve on perfection.</li>
    <li> these soaps are the best soaps and very well traditional soaps from spain. very difficult to find in local stores.... the best</li>
    <li> The soap was advertized as &amp;#34;Myrurgia,&amp;#34; but that was NOWHERE on the packaging (it&#x27;s ALWAYS been on the Maja I&#x27;ve bought before, that had the original scent.)  This version smells good, but  as soon as I started unwrapping a bar, I noticed a scent that is thinner, sharper---not as rich and deep as what I&#x27;ve been accustomed to.  I&#x27;ve been buying Maja since I was 17 (I now am 71.)  My sense of smell has not diminished as regards anything else, so I have to believe this isn&#x27;t quite the same, and the absence of the word &amp;#34;Myrurgia&amp;#34; supports what my nose tells me.</li>
    <li> This is an old soap that has been around forever...I remember it as a kid...and it is great to have it still around.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 40 years...the soap, LOVE the body splash in the summer, lotion, powder; it&#x27;s all wonderful.  The soap is made with Olive Oil and is wonderful for my skin and the beautiful fragrance is just an added bonus!  I have some little sample bars stuck in lingerie drawers ;~))  Wal-Mart used to carry it but sadly, I can no longer find it there!  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading that the formula is different doesn&#x27;t smell the same blah blah blah. I don&#x27;t see a difference. I&#x27;ve been using this soap from the 70s and still love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a thank you for my ex ,who loves the scent and has used this soap for yrs. even though it is supposedly a womens fragrance.  It is a nice scent and the price is good.  I try to buy it whenever I find a good price on it.  I used to get it in Mexico but no longer get that far south.</li>
    <li> This soap has the smell of Heaven. To bathe in it is relaxing and sensous. I am alergic to nearly all fragrances but this soap I can use.Love it</li>
    <li> Not as advertised. It ounces described was for the total of 3 bars, yet it was described as that amount for each.</li>
    <li> Classic scent cant go wrong</li>
    <li> Maja soap has a wonderful fragrance. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> My mother has always loved this soap, which used to be very easy to find in stores. Now, it&#x27;s nearly impossible. I&#x27;m happy to have found these for her recent birthday and the price is right. I&#x27;ll definitely shop again for more for other gift giving occasions.</li>
    <li> Love it used it for years</li>
    <li> I love the scent.  I use it to bathe  and also put it in my drawers and linen closet to give my underwear and linens a nice smell.  I buy it every year for Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great condition</li>
    <li> The problem was,my bad, I guess.  There is no doubt that the round cakes of this soap have a different fragrance than the rectangular ones.  These do not smell bad, but they are not the same.  Next time I will know.  I don&#x27;t blame the seller. Service was very fast and products was in perfect condition when I received it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved the clean and freshness smell that comes from these soaps. I will be getting more for gifts, too. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  A very subtle scent.  Very mild.</li>
    <li> I do know that the soap fragrance has changed from the 60s.  However, it is still a great fragrance and I love it when I open my linen closet to find that fragrance permeating everything!  I must confess there is some \\&quot;elegance\\&quot; missing from the current fragrance.  But someone who has never smelled the older version would never know!  It is lovely!</li>
    <li> I have always loved it!!</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  Been using it for 50 years.  Great price too.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the small version of the soap and the product description is misleading, 9.45 ounce is the whole package of three bars.&lt;br /&gt;This is almost travel size.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the round large ones - 3 of 4.9 ounces each in a package of 3 if you are looking for a better price per ounce.</li>
