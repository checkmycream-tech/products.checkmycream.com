      <li>Nice texture too!</li>
      <li>I found this product after doing an online search for shaving products that had not been tested on animals and I love it!  </li>
      <li>Love and will continue to buy!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this a couple times now and really love it!</li>
      <li>To this end, I tried making my own shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice and has a nice texture.</li>
      <li>Leaves my legs very smooth and no nicks.</li>
      <li>Use with their shaving oil for an even better shave,</li>
      <li>I recommend this for anyone needing a close, safe shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and have already placed my second order.</li>
      <li>but I find that this shaving cream from Pacific is much more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>It is smooth and you can make it foamy if you want and makes for a nice clean shave.  </li>
      <li>I love it that it is eco friendly and made in the US.  </li>
      <li>this shaving cream made shaving my legs so easy, even around knobby parts.  </li>
      <li>Not bad, but I am looking for something more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It makes shaving easy and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Well my face is a smooth as your .......</li>
      <li>and so far it is a good product.</li>
      <li>It worked wonderfully, but what a mess!  </li>
      <li>It rinses clean too, so it doesn&#x27;t gunk up your razor while you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br</li>
      <li>How nice to find a neatly packaged all natural shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>Nice smooth shave, left my legs moist.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much for an easy shave.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically liquid silk once you spread it on – very hard to describe except to say it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>But the positives are that it does smell nice, lathers nicely, and is not too thick.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I have tried to rid our house of as many chemicals as possible.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to support a company with a similar vision that produces products of such a high quality!</li>
      <li>No weird smell, washes clean, but leaves skin very soft.</li>
      <li>I was able to shave my knees without any nicks and my legs were much smoother the next day than with the products I had used before.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much for it to spread out and cover an area.</li>
      <li>but I really like it.  </li>
      <li>This one really works as advertised.</li>
      <li>As the owner of a eco-friendly pet supply company, using products that have not been tested on animals and are produced in a responsible, sustainable manner and include only safe, natural ingredients is a priority.</li>
      <li>It somehow manages to rinse completely clean, but at the same time it leaves your skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>This is overall a nice product, but it does leave my skin dry.  </li>
      <li>Very smooth, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Is not foamy, just creamy, but only needs a little for a smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and this is one of the only products I can use to shave.  </li>
      <li>I also have sensitive underarms, and to combat that, I just use the same amount that I would use for my legs.  </li>

    <li> this shaving cream made shaving my legs so easy, even around knobby parts.  Is not foamy, just creamy, but only needs a little for a smooth shave.  I love it that it is eco friendly and made in the US.  Will definitely buy again and will check out other products they make</li>
    <li> This is overall a nice product, but it does leave my skin dry.  I have been looking for a shaving product that won&#x27;t dry my skin further, and this didn&#x27;t do it for me.  But the positives are that it does smell nice, lathers nicely, and is not too thick.  And a little goes a long way.  I also have sensitive underarms, and to combat that, I just use the same amount that I would use for my legs.  Again, I use such a tiny amount per application that this isn&#x27;t an issue.  Not bad, but I am looking for something more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> As the owner of a eco-friendly pet supply company, using products that have not been tested on animals and are produced in a responsible, sustainable manner and include only safe, natural ingredients is a priority. I found this product after doing an online search for shaving products that had not been tested on animals and I love it!  The cream stayed on in the shower while I shaved without needing to be reapplied, but was not too thick of a consistency -- the shave was closer than with the other &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; shaving products I&#x27;ve used.  I was able to shave my knees without any nicks and my legs were much smoother the next day than with the products I had used before.

    <li> I used Alba Botanica shaving cream for years. I recently used the cream in the aerosol cans but I find that this shaving cream from Pacific is much more moisturizing. It&#x27;s nothing worse than to feel your legs itching after you shave but this cream soothes away that discomfort. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have tried to rid our house of as many chemicals as possible.  To this end, I tried making my own shaving cream.  It worked wonderfully, but what a mess!  How nice to find a neatly packaged all natural shaving cream.  It doesn&#x27;t take much for an easy shave.  I just put a dollop in my hand and work it into a bit of a lather.  (It won&#x27;t be a very thick lather like you might be used to from an aerosol shaving product.)  It makes shaving easy and smooth.  It rinses clean too, so it doesn&#x27;t gunk up your razor while you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and have already placed my second order.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth shave, left my legs moist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far but I really like it.  It is smooth and you can make it foamy if you want and makes for a nice clean shave.  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Love and will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this product my entire life. It&#x27;s basically liquid silk once you spread it on – very hard to describe except to say it&#x27;s perfect. It somehow manages to rinse completely clean, but at the same time it leaves your skin moisturized. Don&#x27;t necessarily be put off by the price, because a little goes a very long way – this isn&#x27;t like your standard can of foam from the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. Use with their shaving oil for an even better shave,</li>
    <li> I used hair conditioner until I found this product. I have no plans to return. I have not nicked myself since using this Shaving Cream. The cream is silky. Only need a little bit to go a long way. The package lasted for 4 months! I recommend this for anyone needing a close, safe shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this a couple times now and really love it!</li>
    <li> Very smooth, and a little goes a long way.  No weird smell, washes clean, but leaves skin very soft. Love it.</li>
    <li> I cannot shave without this product.........love it.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but too pricey for the size and didn&#x27;t last very long. I used less than normal compared to shaving cream cans but maybe got three weeks out of it. Not worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> Just started using it and so far it is a good product. I don&#x27;t have to use much for it to spread out and cover an area. Smells nice and has a nice texture. I look forward to seeing how it works long term. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and this is one of the only products I can use to shave.  I would reccommend it to anyone who needs something that is hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> Wayyy better then anything else I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Was so sick of contant small cuts while shaving. This one really works as advertised. Nice texture too!</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream.  Leaves my legs very smooth and no nicks.</li>
    <li> Grab it from my girls bag and used it. Reordered not reading its for wemon till i got it. Well my face is a smooth as your ....... when i shave with it</li>
