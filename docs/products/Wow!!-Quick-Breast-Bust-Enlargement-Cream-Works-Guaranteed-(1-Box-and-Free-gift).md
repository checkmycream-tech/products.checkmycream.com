      <li>thanks for it .</li>
      <li>I gave 2 stars because of the fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a very dedicated person that refuses to take no as an answer ive ordered 3 bottles of this</li>
      <li>and I really was hoping</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
      <li>and yes it makes you feel much sexier</li>
      <li>STILL USING HAVE NOT YET SEEN MUCH OR ANY RESULTS WILL CONTINUE USE</li>
      <li>I have no negative or positive feedback yet.</li>
      <li>After months of trying it, i have not noticed any change, other than being more sensitve.</li>
      <li>Not only are they larger, but much fuller and more perky than before.</li>
      <li>Just recieved my first jar put it on first time last night and saw results in morning , cant wait to see what its like in a fewweeks !</li>

      <li>I just bought my second supply and am very thankful to have found this product!!</li>
      <li>Its only 16 dollars so its worth the try.  </li>
      <li>right next to my name</li>
      <li>Love this product but the jar is kinda small  </li>
      <li>is tht the jar is cute but small</li>
      <li>( I&#x27;m just not willing to take any chances, if that is true).</li>
      <li>is a natural plant extract).</li>
      <li>My only compliant is that my breasts are very tender.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t do anything to help with firming or making your breasts look bigger or more firm.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend Quick breast bust enlargement cream and it was waste of my money.</li>
      <li>I just used it for about a week don&#x27;t have major results yet</li>
      <li>hmm i hope this is not fake and ill use it with high hopes because it states that is 99% guaranteed and that i will see results as quickly as within a week...</li>
      <li>The only bad thing is how long it takes to ship, but for the price and considering how far it&#x27;s traveling its great.</li>
      <li>So this product helped my breasts look &amp; feel firm, perky and much fuller too!</li>
      <li>I was a deflated c cup and after one jar, using unfaithfully twice a day, they have grown fuller, with more bounce, into a d cup and my stretch marks are fading!</li>
      <li>I like it because it came with a little soap, was delivered fast, but it didn&#x27;t do anything</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product did not work for me</li>
    <li> Yes! This product works well. Mine came in with a soap. There is no bad smell to any of the product.</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ll i order this product cause i wanted to give it a try hey anything to get some breast with out pain surgery and save some money but today when i got my order by mail i checked i was so excited but it turns out i got some thing else so i contact them and told them everything and it was really easy they gave me total refund and they were really nice didn&#x27;t have any difficulty they answer quick to my problem even that i didn&#x27;t got the product that i order i give them 5 stars i will order again i hope this time i get the cream that i order well just wanted to let y&#x27;all know my experience... we&#x27;ll i order it and again receive the wrong product something call rapibust from insane deals inc. so the people should receive what they paid for i don&#x27;t know why i keep receiving some other stuff.</li>
    <li> have been noticing the difference is size after only a short period of time will definately be ordering more from you</li>
    <li> Time for receiving was great, better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to use Amazon again for this type of items.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for that</li>
    <li> I will reorder, I have been using it for 3 weeks and have gained 1 inch. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a month in a half and haven&#x27;t noticed anything. Might I add it took forever to come and smells like vics vapor rub..waste of money...</li>
    <li> does not work period.</li>
    <li> The bust enlargement product is easy to apply and does make your breast fuller and firmer very nice product to use on your breast area.</li>
    <li> WASTE OF MONEY, DOESN&#x27;T WORK EVEN IF IT SAYS ITS GONE WORK. I WOULD RECOMMEND NOT TO FALL FOR THESE. IT DOES NOT WORK EVEN .01%!</li>
    <li> I am a mother of 4. Which as most moms know just one child wrecks your rack. Im not really wanting to get a boob job I really just want them to fill back out to the perky things I liked just fine before. So thst being said id try almost anything . Save your money. I wanted so bad to believe it was going to help my hubby thought I was silly for even trying the stuff I should have listened. I gave it one star because i recieved it super fast.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I do like it.. I just used it for about a week don&#x27;t have major results yet but I think it is working because it&#x27;s a little firmer as it describes</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright . It didn&#x27;t do what I wanted to do. But it&#x27;s in alright for those who had bigger boobs</li>
    <li> i am still using the cream</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. :&#x27;( i was very disappointed. I guess in order to get larger breast we will have to go under the knife, no not really, just gotta be happy with what God gave you.</li>
    <li> This cream will make your breast a little bigger, noticeably bigger, but not a cup size bigger which is why I only gave it 4 star rating.  I wish there was a cream that could make my breast grow as large as I would like them to be.</li>
    <li> I love it haven&#x27;t been using it long but you can feel the tingle and by using a breast pump with it I know it will make my breast the size I want them..</li>
    <li> Really is a good cream used it morning and night on my breasts and buttocks and did work out on top of that have seen a difference in the way my clothes fit is tighter and better work out ladies if u want it right really will see in a few weeks time and look on YouTube for leg workouts and forgot to mention tht it also works for ur breasts lifts and adds only bad thing I will say is tht the jar is cute but small&lt;br /&gt;Classic Chocolate</li>
    <li> Waste of money . I bought 3 times I was thinking it would be effective but I was wrong . Very sad :( don&#x27;t buy this thing .</li>
    <li> it didnt work i just waste my money i doesnt work at all and i make another order that i never recive i would never buy anything like this</li>
    <li> I got it 8 days early so that&#x27;s cool cant wait to use it the only thing daren&#x27;t like was the smell kind of like antibiotics medicine smell lol but will post latter if it work</li>
    <li> I read other reviews about this product &amp; so I wanted to give it a try (since it&#x27;s active ingredient is a natural plant extract). It met my expectations &amp; my boyfriend &amp; I are loving the results! I lost 45 in the past year &amp; my breast size actually decreased due to a lot of fat loss. So this product helped my breasts look &amp; feel firm, perky and much fuller too! ***Please Note: I use gloves when applying &amp; massaging the product into my skin because I have read a review saying that this product makes your hands larger if you don&#x27;t use gloves. ( I&#x27;m just not willing to take any chances, if that is true).</li>
    <li> Ladies, this stuff truly works!! I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and a half, I&#x27;ve already seen such a difference in my breasts. Not only are they larger, but much fuller and more perky than before. But, you must put it on at least once a day immediately after you shower. That&#x27;s when you can actually feel it working. My boyfriend thought I was crazy for trying this, but when he started seeing a difference he was very thankful as well!! lol!! I just bought my second supply and am very thankful to have found this product!! I can&#x27;t believe it actually works!!</li>
    <li> Felt some what of a difference but they&#x27;re not getting BIG..&lt;br /&gt;I need big boobs. someone recommend something please&lt;br /&gt;#whitegirlproblems</li>
    <li> So ladies, if you are looking to increase your boob size, this is a good product to get. I haven&#x27;t used it like you&#x27;re supposed to, but even the couple times I used it I felt the difference. After two uses I felt the size seemed bigger. My shape is not full, but after using this product a couple times, I noticed my shape was a bit fuller all around. Warning, do use gloves when applying it because it may cause hands to swell. Love this product!</li>
    <li> This is scam. Don&#x27;t bother buying because it doesn&#x27;t work at All. I have been using this for a while and no results.</li>
    <li> This cream helped to tighten and lift my breasts but I didn&#x27;t have any changes in breast size. Would recommend this to someone who wants their breasts to be more perky. From the reviews I read it seems like everyone got different results. So it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try, it might work better for you than it did for me.</li>
    <li> These products can help you to become the woman you desire to be. I would recommend these product to any one who to wish to any trans women</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work,seemed okay because of tingling sensations but overall doesn&#x27;t work one bitso i have it one star,should of gave it a zero</li>
    <li> just like lotion just creamy it does keep my breast very soft and has a pleasant smell. I wont buy it again</li>
    <li> Love it my breasts are fuller and firmer I have noticed results in one week</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. I use this for two weeks and no result. I would not recommend Quick breast bust enlargement cream and it was waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work I have AA cup boobs and I really was hoping but it didn&#x27;t change them at all</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I just ordered my second jar! The only bad thing is how long it takes to ship, but for the price and considering how far it&#x27;s traveling its great. I was a deflated c cup and after one jar, using unfaithfully twice a day, they have grown fuller, with more bounce, into a d cup and my stretch marks are fading! Love this product! It does mock estrogen tho so it will change your monthly cycle.. So be safe with breast cancer family history. Other than that... Amazing!</li>
    <li> I have no negative or positive feedback yet. Will update when I have finally come to a conclusion about the product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This product is a good product if you do your research overall it will take about 1 to 2 months for then to fully grow and develop. Also its also depends if you have all your vitamins in your breast so that way it can grow. If you dont it will take longer because the cream gives you what your missing. But once you have all that is done your breast will start growing faster. Ladies you have to do your research and READ ! Its a process</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very dedicated person that refuses to take no as an answer ive ordered 3 bottles of this and now ive got a pretty set of boobs and im very happy now I owe it all to this company too cuz their product works so darn well but iv warn gloves I don&#x27;t want my hands to get big to but whatever I put this on expect it to grow it has plumed up my butt area and my breast very happy custumer always gonna order from this company would recommend to all people that want much bigger body parts and yes it makes you feel much sexier then youd ever think happy happy happy</li>
    <li> This product definitely works. I have seen an increase of over two cup sizes in the month I&#x27;ve been using it. Problem is, the instructions that come with the product don&#x27;t mention that you have to wear gloves when applying it. Turns out the stuff makes EVERYTHING bigger!  Now I have ginormous man-hands. Seriously, they&#x27;re bigger than my husband&#x27;s. He won&#x27;t hold hands with me anymore, he hates getting his swallowed up by my massive meat mittens. Wear Gloves, Ladies!!!</li>
    <li> it is ok, i have noticed some change despite the fact that i am not so frequent in using it.</li>
    <li> That product did not work for me... I followed all the instructions and nothing happend i want my money back, i was very disappointed!!!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all. So far not satisfied with this product. I&#x27;ll use it til the bottle is empty but probably will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was told upon purchase that I would receive a free gift which I didn&#x27;t.  It also caused my menses to change cycle for which I actually accused my husband of cheating</li>
    <li> Does not work, used it for a month, smells like vapor rub or something, but it does not work waste of money.</li>
    <li> Just recieved my first jar put it on first time last night and saw results in morning , cant wait to see what its like in a fewweeks ! i just hate it doent come with insturtions i dont know how much i should apply , other than that its great</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  The tingling feeling after applying it is due to the mint in the product.  The content is small, so it is actually not cheaper than other products if you consider the oz per dollar.</li>
    <li> I lost all my boobs after having a child. I could hardly fit in a A cup  I was a DD before I had my son!! So I was desperate! This stuff works amazingly. And I noticed a difference within about 4 uses. My only compliant is that my breasts are very tender. But I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s normal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other creams, pills, devices with no effect, this has made some growth, not from A to C as many dream but a fuller A</li>
    <li> The product did not work for me. I used 3 bottles and I did not see any improvement with my breast. I gave 2 stars because of the fast delivery.</li>
    <li> this doesn&#x27;t work out for me . Dnt waste to buy it if not work out.  thanks for it .</li>
    <li> After months of trying it, i have not noticed any change, other than being more sensitve.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this product, once the tube is finished I will give it another try with a second order</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes , I&#x27;ve been doing it morning and nite plus taking pills on top of that. Plus I&#x27;m almost of cream already ,,... And Nothing yet. Kinda lost of money👎.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me. I like it because it came with a little soap, was delivered fast, but it didn&#x27;t do anything, the reviews on this were awesome, and I used gloves just in case because of one review, but no changes. Once in awhile I feel a change when Im putting the soap on in the shower, but other than that. It&#x27;s like nothing changes. Already had 2 of these thinking maybe one wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me, it is fantastic and works very well. Use gloves when applying it though. Makes hands swell too.</li>
    <li> I ordered  on the 6th of Febuary and it said it would be here on the 5th of March~ Ridiculous for the tie but eh it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m 19 and im still an A cup and my past boyfriends have broken up with me when i told them that I stuff my bra... Hope this works..</li>
    <li> not rly sure if this stuff works..im and a cup after having 3 kids i lost all my boobage and im 24 goin on 25 and i decided to try this hoping it would work..not to sure yet..ill update later</li>
    <li> Works on some maybe but not for me.</li>
    <li> This product did everything it said it would. Within just about 2 weeks this cream really enhanced my breasts and made them completely more fuller, rounder, and LARGER! Fabulous product!</li>
    <li> it says on the package, &amp;#34;BREAST lotion&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;i would&#x27;ve sent it back but with all the hassle its easier to write this instead</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the fast shipping it was expected to come in two more weeks. I just received it and I laughed at the packing... its not discreet at all LOL! right next to my name where my shipping info it clearly said &amp;#34; Breast cream moisturizer&amp;#34; lol oh well. Im excited to try it although it doesn&#x27;t have much good review but i rather have this than a bunch of  &amp;#34;Fake&amp;#34; good reviews like other breast creams. Its only 16 dollars so its worth the try.  People from previous reviews have said the scent of this cream is minty and that is like vapor rub??????  What i received the scent smells like strawberry and it looks like strawberry yogurt..hmm i hope this is not fake and ill use it with high hopes because it states that is 99% guaranteed and that i will see results as quickly as within a week... I hope this is true.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything to help with firming or making your breasts look bigger or more firm. Not worth the money</li>
    <li> Using this product has helped Me regain My lost breast tissue from having kids! Love this product but the jar is kinda small  and it took 3 weeks to be delivered, but I will be ordering More.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Came within two business days I put it on twice yesterday and over night they grew. I was so surprised and impressed can&#x27;t wait to continue using it.. And the smell it&#x27;s just fine.. When I run out I&#x27;ll be buying more :)</li>
    <li> I had a bad reaction to this product! I will never get this ever again!</li>
    <li> STILL USING HAVE NOT YET SEEN MUCH OR ANY RESULTS WILL CONTINUE USE</li>
    <li> It works....its a great product..... Cheap price too</li>
    <li> The cream does work ,, but however on my last order as on another order the lid  on the product was not securely tightedned or came loose in transit . This caused a loss of the product  they took care of the first and hope they do so with this one. I am not sure what happened  to them that caused it but it did .</li>
    <li> Yes I have finished a jar and there are definitely fuller. About a 1/2 cup difference and increasing. I&#x27;m working on my next jar hoping to keep.increasing size</li>
</ol>
