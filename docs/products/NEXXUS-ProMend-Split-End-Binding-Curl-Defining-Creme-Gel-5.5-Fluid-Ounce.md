<li> goes a long way.  </li>
<li> When my hair dries it has a slight wavy/ curl that weighs my hair down enough to have no poof but enough volume to look</li>
<li> like I spent a ton of time with my hair.</li>
<li> if i wash and then apply some of this on wet hair, comb and scrunch, it will&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
<li> My hair thin and straight; this helped with volume as well as reduced the frizz.</li>
<li> I know, i know its meant to work with curls and there are other products</li>
<li> Due to all the bleach in my hair from my lighter days my hair would not curl like it use to.</li>
<li> I have very thick and naturally curly hair and this works wonders.</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical at first because Nexxus is a white/non-black hair care line, and I didn&#x27;t think that it would work on my hair.</li>
<li> The only unfortunate thing is that my local walmart hasn&#x27;t had it in stock for sometime.</li>
<li> Even when I straighten it I need something to put a little weight to it with out weighing it down.</li>
<li> Never feels heavy or greasy the way I use it.</li>
<li> It work as a curve defined, but not sure about split mender</li>
<li> With this product my hair curled from roots to ends without making it hard.</li>
<li> When my hair is still damp I take about a quarter size amount (I have really thick hair) and thin it out with a little water.</li>
<li> so split ends are a serious problem.</li>

    <li> Even better the next day when air dry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see much &amp;#34;curl defining&amp;#34; going on, but it has a great smell and makes my hair feel a bit softer.  I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if anything changes.</li>
    <li> I live in AZ and my hair can become dry and frizzy. Thus product keeps my hair smooth and adds shine. Highly recommend it. Can&#x27;t find in stores. Great shipping and speedy to. Packaged great. Thank you. Will shop again as you have a great selection.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for curly hair! This product defines and holds curls without being sticky or crunchy. I have naturally curly, &amp;#34;mixed girl hair&amp;#34; and I can use this product alone for perfect curls and zero frizz. I keep a stock pile!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, the smell is pleasant but not overpowering.  It gives me nice defined curls without the &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; of a lot of hair products.  Reasonably priced as well.</li>

    <li> Great product for curly hair, it does not weigh the hair down and greatly helps to prevent split ends.</li>
    <li> Naturally my hair is wavy and super poofy, not frizzy, poofy. Even when I straighten it I need something to put a little weight to it with out weighing it down. With NEXXUS ProMend Split End Binding Curl Defining Creme Gel I can do that. When my hair is still damp I take about a quarter size amount (I have really thick hair) and thin it out with a little water. I run it through the length of my hair and kinda scrunch like I would with mousse. When my hair dries it has a slight wavy/ curl that weighs my hair down enough to have no poof but enough volume to look like I spent a ton of time with my hair. I&#x27;ve also used this product when curling my hair or straightening, not for the curl defining aspect but for the split end binding. I know, i know its meant to work with curls and there are other products but this brand that do the end mending with out the curl definer but I prefer this product and it works great. The only unfortunate thing is that my local walmart hasn&#x27;t had it in stock for sometime. Thankfully Amazon has it at a reasonable price. I think next time I will look into Amazon&#x27;s 4 pack of it. :)</li>
    <li> Exceptional product. My hair thin and straight; this helped with volume as well as reduced the frizz. I use a curling iron and this feels protective.</li>
    <li> light weight and soft hold.</li>
    <li> It work as a curve defined, but not sure about split mender</li>
    <li> Nexxus ProMend is a great product for curly hair, and I have seen my split ends decrease while using this! It does contain paraben and sulfates</li>
    <li> This works great on my thin hair, which brings lift and body. I enjoy this product, and your asking for to much verbage here. This should be my choice on how much to write.</li>
    <li> I color my hair and perm it so split ends are a serious problem. One use and my hair feels like new.</li>
    <li> I use this on my ends everyday and my curls are nice and bouncy!&lt;br /&gt;I rarely have split ends any more.</li>
    <li> Wow! I used this product in GA where the weather can be very hot and humid, THIS PRODUCT IS FANTASTIC!!</li>
    <li> Finally! A hair gel/creme that works! I used to use Making Waves but they no longer make it. So I have been on the hunt for a replacement.  This stuff is awesome. It doesn&#x27;t leave my curls sticky or hard and gives my curls great definition and hold. I have very thick and naturally curly hair and this works wonders. I also use the Frizz Defy hairspray by Nexxus (smells really good and has good hold).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl your hair one bit</li>
    <li> When it dries it feels crunchy. I was hoping that it would be softer because it has creme in the name, but the gel part won out. I should have know. Other than the crunchy part it was nice, just not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and fragile.  So far this is the best product I have found to control the friz.  I use it as directed while my hair is still wet and not too much.  Sometimes I touch up after my hair dries with a dab rubbed between my fingers tips and brushed on lightly.  I like this product and a large tube goes a long way.  Never feels heavy or greasy the way I use it.</li>
    <li> Nice product! Not only does it make the curls look nicer but it repairs the split ends while doing it. Perfect combo!</li>
    <li> It works as promised. Split ends were repaired and my hair is soft and shiny just as I had hoped</li>
    <li> I love this. I have wavy hair and if i wash and then apply some of this on wet hair, comb and scrunch, it will&lt;br /&gt;Look great once it&#x27;s dry. For thise days when you have no time for blowdrying or wants to give your hair a break from heat, this will work your curls, yet make them look neat and put!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. This stuff is the truth truth. I was blessed to have found this stuff at the 99 cent store. I was a little skeptical at first because Nexxus is a white/non-black hair care line, and I didn&#x27;t think that it would work on my hair. So, as I was waiting online, I quickly went on Amzaon.com and read the reviews. I was blessed to have stumbled upon a sista who said that this stuff works. So, I went ahead and bought it. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy more. That product was only 99cents. Dang. Oh, well. Its worth every penny. Oh, it made my curls beyond defined. Their big, bouncy and soft. Best curly girl product out there.</li>
    <li> Love it,  Helping my hair which is very dry and suffering damage from hair color.</li>
