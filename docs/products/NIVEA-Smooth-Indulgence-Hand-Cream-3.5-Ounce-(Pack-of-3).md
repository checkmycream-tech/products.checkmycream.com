      <li>I LOVE the Nivea hand cream.</li>
      <li>Nivea is one of my favorite creams.  </li>
      <li>100% satisfied.</li>

      <li>The fragrance is not too strong and I use it at bed time to keep my hands from cracking.</li>
      <li>In this cream the scent is not as strong as i remember but that might be because they&#x27;ve added macadamia nut oil to it.  </li>

      <li>Aveeno hand cream beats it in all three areas(faster drying time, fragrance free and not greasy after you give it a chance to soak in).</li>

      <li>Too light and greasy</li>
      <li>I bought the set of 3 Nivea Smooth Indulgence hand creams, and I cannot be happier.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cream smells nice, absorbs fast and leaves no greasy feeling/residue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, it&#x27;s creamy and my skin is softer.</li>
      <li>My skin and cuticles are significantly improved, are these my hands?</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves hands feeling smooth and not sticky like some</li>
      <li>most of them don&#x27;t really work.  </li>
      <li>While I haven&#x27;t found anything that makes my dry hands completely soft, this is the best thing I have found.</li>
      <li>It makes my hands feel really soft, it absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy, plus it smells nice</li>

      <li>Not greasy and works into the skin quickly.</li>
      <li>This hand cream moisturize and absorb into the skin quickly.  </li>

      <li>My hands feel so very nice and makes me want to try other Nivea products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy, it absorbs quickly and has a very light scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this hand cream, especially in the winter.  Not greasy at all and very effective.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! It makes my hands feel really soft, it absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy, plus it smells nice (a clean pleasant smell.. not to strong like other hand lotions), and more importantly its a great deal.  I use to buy $20 hand lotions but this product is wayyy better.  I had first purchased this lotion from Walmart but recently I have not seen them on the shelves so I decided to check Amazon. I found that Amazon actually sells it for cheaper and in a 3-pack.  Now I keep one at home, one in my purse, and one at the office.  I&#x27;m never without my Nivea Hand Cream. Oooo.. I just thought of something.  This would be a great stocking stuffer for Christmas! Hehe..    Wow, I sound like a salesperson.  I&#x27;m just really happy I found the best hand lotion and I want people to try out too because I don&#x27;t ever want Nivea to discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> i bought this product to use at work. i work in a motorcycle dealership and touch a lot of dirty things, so i&#x27;m always washing my hands. this lotion helps keep my hands happy!</li>
    <li> Another Nivea product and the quality shows everytime. You get what you pay for and it pays to go for the best</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Nivea Hand Cream Smooth Indulgence--I hate when my hands feel greasy, because I have a tendancy to touch my face a lot.  This is the only hand cream/lotion I have found that works wonders yet doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like I dipped my hands in oil.  Thanks for this great product Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> I am really rough on my hands and they were really looking raggedy.  [I do not buy fancy creams and usually use products like Gold Bond and Aveeno, (I really liked Pacquin when it was readily available). I do not like perfumes.] This product is really wonderful; smooth and silky on my hands and feet. Used this product for the first time last night and there was a noticeable improvement. After using the hand cream again this morning, I knew I should write a review.  My skin and cuticles are significantly improved, are these my hands? The light smell is fresh and pleasant. My hands feel so very nice and makes me want to try other Nivea products.</li>
    <li> Nivea is one of my favorite creams.  Good quality for the price. I keep one in handy places, so I&#x27;m not searching when I need it.</li>
    <li> I am busy with my toddler, and sometimes don;t have time or don&#x27;t think about using gloves to wash some dishes/bottles. Gain dishwasher liquid is very drying and soon enough i had very destroyed hands. To the point I was embarrassed to shake hands.&lt;br /&gt;I use also L&#x27;Occitane shea butter which I love, but have to admit that Nivea keeps my hands smooth again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cream smells nice, absorbs fast and leaves no greasy feeling/residue. Price is outstanding for such a quality.</li>
    <li> While growing up my parents used to always have Nivea cream around.  My parents were German and Nivea is a German company so i always associated the smell of Nivea with both my parents and where i was born.  In this cream the scent is not as strong as i remember but that might be because they&#x27;ve added macadamia nut oil to it.  But it&#x27;s a delightful smell and soothing and long-lasting also.  I just spent some good money on other hand creams from Sephora and they were horrible in comparison.  I&#x27;ll stick with Nivea.</li>
    <li> Just a little bit of it could make your hand soft, removing dryness and crack.&lt;br /&gt;My hands had been cracked for several days so I went to amazon and to my best of luck, found this hand cream. ^_^.&lt;br /&gt;I just put a light amount of it to my hand and after one day, the crack healed up. I have never expected that it could be such effective, better than all hand creams I have used before.</li>
    <li> I hate the smell. It is a sickening perfume. In al fairness, I do not like many perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the smell you will like this product. It absorbs quickly and leaves hands feeling smooth and not sticky like some I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All leave prints on my ipad but this one is not as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you check out the smell before ordering 3 like I did. I also have Gold Bond Ultimate in tube. Hate the smell of it, too.</li>
    <li> I am using this product for the last one month and I am extremely satisfied. One good thing about this hand cream is that its not greasy and does not have any smell. I work in a lab and I can feel my hand skin improving. This product is worth giving a try.</li>
    <li> I grew up with Nivea products, my grandmothers used them, my Mom does and so do I. I LOVE the Nivea hand cream. I finally found one that keeps its promise. It makes my hands feel smooth and lasts the whole day. Finally my hands don&#x27;t feel dried out anymore after my daily shower. Instead the skin is moisturized and smells good.</li>
    <li> I am a male in my forties and since i can remember, I hate any kind of hand cream. For up to few months ago that was the case for over 40 years because i dont like oily feeling hand, but that changed when i moved to los angeles suburb that has a cold and very dry  fall and winter. After a little bit research, i decided to order Nivea smooth indulgence hand cream 3.5 Oz/99 Gr. and I was pleasently surprised. After few minutes of applying this cream, it quickly absorb and at the same time my hand was soft and looks younger looking. I bought this cream (3 pack) about 9 months ago and now i use it regulary. I have a 6 year old daughter which i use it on her hand too and she loves it (for some strange reason my daughter does not like oily palm too but not in this case). I love this cream. If you use very thick layer, it take more time to absorb (obviously). Also, If you looking at \\&quot;Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream\\&quot; (Another nice hand cream) compare to Nivea, It takes much longer to absorb and leave your hand creasy longer that average.  One thing though, This cream does NOT Heal dry hand due to lack of vitamin or medical problem.  This cream is made in France and has Macadamia Nut Oil and different kind of minerals and vitamins like, B5 &amp; F.</li>
    <li> I have tried many handcreams over the years, and this is the only one that actually works well. It is not greasy, has a pleasant scent, and is absorbed very quickly into the skin. The best thing about this product is you can see the results immediately. Your hands look less dry, less lined, and smoother as soon as it soaks in. I highly recommend this lotion if you have to wash your hands alot or tend to have dry skin. It also soothes itchy hands if they are just overdry.</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream ever - I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews of products, but this is truly the first one that I feel I have to tell the world about!  The lotion absorbs into my skin almost immediately, is not greasy at all, has a mild, pleasant scent, and leaves my hands (even my cuticles) moisturized and velvety smooth for hours.  I&#x27;ve searched for years for a hand lotion that has everything I&#x27;m looking for, and I&#x27;ve finally found it!  Thank you, Nivea!!!</li>
    <li> I love Gold Bond medicated lotion (the kind in the green bottle with the red lid/pump), but it&#x27;s inconvenient to carry around with me in my purse. I decided to try my luck with another lotion for my hands; I bought this Nivea one because of the small, portable container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m happy with it. It doesn&#x27;t *quite* live up to the promise on the tube (of only needing to be used once a day), but using it twice a day has been sufficient to keep my hands soft as the weather has gotten colder. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this lotion at once, so the tube lasts a long time. The lotion is a white color (so it has no dyes) but the product does have an aroma to it. I happen to like the smell. I usually have very sensitive skin and have to be careful about what lotions I use on my hands, but this one does not cause any adverse reactions. I have had a couple of small cuts on my hands the last few days (paper cuts, and scratch marks from giving pills to cats), and these have healed quickly. My hands do not feel greasy after applying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are: Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Glucoside, Cetyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Myristyl Myristate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Panthenol, Macadamia Ternifolia (Nut) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Coco Glycerides, Dimethicone, Carbomer, Trisodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the ingredients are synthetic chemicals, obviously, but there do not appear to be animal-derived ingredients. (FYI, macadamia nuts are poisonous to dogs and cats. Since this product contains macadamia nut oil, out of an abundance of caution, don&#x27;t keep the tube where your pets may have access to it.) All-in-all, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of hand cream products. With sensitive skin and allergies my choices are limited. On top of that, at my job frequent hand washing is a necessity. This product is great! It goes on smoothly, and is not oily or thick and paste-like. Even the smell is nice. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This lotion is creamy without being excessively greasy. The three pack was a perfect value. I keep one in my room, one in my purse and gave another to my son. (The winter months can be brutal to our skin!)</li>
    <li> My hands are always dry in winter months cause I wash them so many times. After trying few expensive creams I ended up ordering this one and let me tell u it made a huge difference. My hands are so soft even after one use. I&#x27;m sticking with this hand cream and not wasting my money on anything else.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema on his hands which causes dry, cracked bleeding little fingers. Our dermatologist said it&#x27;s the toughest area to control. He was right. I&#x27;ve tried prescription creams, lotions, more creams, oils and essential oils (lavender oil is supposed to be amazing for healing dry skin). Nothing helped. On a whim I grabbed this at CVS ($7 for just one tube) and every day you can tell the skin was healing. 4 days later his little fingers are getting soft again. Amazing stuff. For my child I can&#x27;t be without this.</li>
    <li> This hand lotion was just ok in my opinion. I like the thicker one Nivea produces more. Too light and greasy</li>
    <li> It was okay but it was also way to greasy for me to purchase again. I hate greasy products and it left a residue on everything I touched until I washed my hands.</li>
    <li> Smooth and smells amazing without being heavily scented. I keep one with me at all times! It&#x27;s absolutley amazing. Totally recommended</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smooth, it&#x27;s creamy and my skin is softer. Other that that, what more is there to say? It smells nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy that doesn&#x27;t like slippery hands nor do I like cracked painful hands. This stuff does a great job of absorbing into the skin. Highly recommend. Especially if your in a wheelchair and can&#x27;t have slick hands</li>
    <li> One tube arrived cracked and there was cream all over. And the tubes had a strange odor on them. I had to wash all 3 to remove cream and smell. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I try other hand creams regularly whenever they&#x27;re on sale.  I always come back to this hand cream.  So far no other hand cream have performed better.  This hand cream moisturize and absorb into the skin quickly.  Most importantly it last even after a few hand washings.</li>
    <li> Works awesome and lasts a long time. Perfect size for a carry on or a purse. Even in the glove box when your hands get dry. Will be buying again</li>
    <li> I have always liked just about any lotions that Nivea puts out. I have tried several of theirs. My hands and skin are really dry and it works for me. I don&#x27;t like a heavy greasy feel..so I stick to what I know. Thank you</li>
    <li> Very good product and price.</li>
    <li> This cream really soothes and protects hands.  I am in the medical field and have to constantly wash my hands and this has really helping my dry cracking chapped hands!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream. It absorbs quickly into your skin and is perfect for those of us who are sensitive to most hand lotions!</li>
    <li> Its hard to find a good hand cream but this is definitely one of them. It makes my hand very soft without the greesy feeling. it smells great</li>
    <li> Wanted to get something that is not very oily yet moisturing. seeing the good reviews with this product, i decided to try it. bought the 3 packs, and like the smell of it. the smell is not strong like rubbing perfume on your hands, very light scent, and not very oily. in the summer time, it is ok, but in the winter time, and especially for someone who has easily chapped hands, definitely not moisturizing enough.</li>
    <li> Between extensive gardening,small children and just life,I am very rough on my hands.Over the years I must have tried the majority of quality handcreams on the market in order to get relief from dry, cracked and even bleeding hands and cuticles.Then I tried a 2oz.sample of this product,and before the tiny tube was half empty, my hands and fingers were almost totally healed and, with continued use of this product,are now in great shape.  A little goes a long ways,it absorbs very quickly leaving the skin with a nice,non-greasy soft feeling and a wonderful fresh scent.</li>
    <li> its a good size for in the glove compartment and hand bags I like Nivea products price is good  any thing to help with dry skin and this does that</li>
    <li> Great cream - feels wonderful on my hands, not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> the hand cream is really for your hands. leave your very soft and smell really good. I&#x27;m planning to buy more when I&#x27;m done with these.</li>
    <li> Does what Nivea says:&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy. It works well, makes hands soft, and I used it at work with my keyboard/mouse without problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not smell as nice as I had expected... but it&#x27;s a typical Nivea scent. Pleasant and subtle.</li>
    <li> I am very picky when it comes to hand creams. This one is very good.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of lotions, moisturizers, etc.  most of them don&#x27;t really work.  But my wife brought this stuff home.  surprised me how useful it was.  not greasy, absorbs quickly.  reasonable price.  even helped with a little bit of razor burn.  three pack is good deal.</li>
    <li> Seems like any other decent hand cream. Moisturizes well and does dry faster than some body lotions might, but does not dry much faster than other hand creams.</li>
    <li> My hands feel amazing and it&#x27;s not greasy or overly scented - my go to hand lotion!! Love nivea cream, but it&#x27;s too greasy for hands during the day, so I use this instead!</li>
    <li> Not greasy and works into the skin quickly. It has a pleasant light fragrance and I feel a difference in my chapped hands. Three packs at a decent price.</li>
    <li> Wife and I are fans of Nivea and this hand lotion is superb. Keeps hands moisturized yet it does not feel oily at all.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it daily.It does what she wants as far as keeping her hands from dryng out. We will continue to order it as needed.</li>
    <li> I tend to have dry hands which eventually start to crack if I go for a few weeks without moisturizing my hands.  Playing tennis with dry hands makes it get worse more quickly.  I apply a little at night before sleeping and it helps.  It is also relatively light and non-greasy as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> My problem is a very dry hands in winter! I tried different brands, but anyway, in the middle of the night I could feel my hands DRY!&lt;br /&gt;This cream works great! I would definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> I have a thing about using lotion every time I wash my hands. I don&#x27;t like the feeling if dry, tight skin so the solution is simple, keep lotion nearby. I&#x27;ve used this Nivea hand creme for years now, I&#x27;ve tried other brands but I keep coming back to this one. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy, it absorbs quickly and has a very light scent.</li>
    <li> Will buy again. With the tree pack I keep one in my bag to take to work, one upstairs and one down stairs in my home. I get really dry hands and found this stuff really helps. My boyfriends hands are worse then mine and I found him using it as well he states that it is &amp;#34;the only stuff that works&amp;#34;. Good deal.</li>
    <li> Meh. I was hoping to replace my empty tube of Nivea&#x27;s Restorative Night Hand Creme, which had a lovely, delicate scent and was wonderful for dry skin. This Smooth Indulgence is no better than any other random hand cream you might pick up at the drugstore. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> As an EMT I wash my hands a lot! Especially in the winter my cuticles will crack and bleed. This keeps my hands from drying out, and with a minute of rubbing in leaves no slippery deposits.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous different hand creams and lotions. While I haven&#x27;t found anything that makes my dry hands completely soft, this is the best thing I have found. Healed my cracked knuckles and keeps my hands in much better condition than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> I used only morning and night before I got to bed.  It is awesome.  I&#x27;ve been looking for perfect hand lotions for years but some of dry my skin fast as soon I put on it.  This product is excellent for hands and feet.  I&#x27;m happy to found these.  I bought three sets for one price.</li>
    <li> Was purchased as a stocking stuffer for my husband.  Love the size for travel and to have one in the car- perfect after handwashing in public.</li>
    <li> I bought the set of 3 Nivea Smooth Indulgence hand creams, and I cannot be happier. The cream is lightly scented, absorbs very fast and provides moisture for a long time even after washing hands. I apply it once daily, and it still prevents my hands from drying or itching. Great product.</li>
    <li> this is a great hand lotion :-)</li>
    <li> My hands get pretty dry during the winter.  If I play Bball regularly that just compounds it and I&#x27;ll get little cuts in my fingers from the skin being so dry.  So, I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of hand creams.  I found this cream to be satisfactory if you are gonna use it right before bed so that you don&#x27;t need to handle anything after.  The one thing that&#x27;s a deal breaker for me is the fragrance they put in it.  It also takes longer to dry and has a greasy feel.  Aveeno hand cream beats it in all three areas(faster drying time, fragrance free and not greasy after you give it a chance to soak in).</li>
    <li> winter dries my hands out like no other and my friends have lovingly dubbed me &amp;#34;Ashy Larry&amp;#34; and since my gf bought me this hand creme ive been hooked....the nickname is still there tho haha</li>
    <li> At first I was considering returning these, as there is no expiration date anywhere on the tube. Then I started using them, and they work fine. The smell is very similar to Nivea&#x27;s classic creme scent. It&#x27;s just a little bit greasy, but it&#x27;s OK, it moisturizes well and lasts for a while. I would probably not buy it again, but it&#x27;s an okay product. It&#x27;s also made in France, not in Germany, but I believe the product description mentions that.</li>
    <li> Not greasy. Pleasant light fragrance. Great product for someone without a dishwasher and chronically cracked fingers!</li>
    <li> really takes care of my dry hands after a day at work.</li>
    <li> so glad I found these...I got the same lotion (different packaging) in the UK a year or so ago and it&#x27;s just soooo much better than the US version!  Not greasy, smells good but not overpowering...but not available in the US.  :-(  (and while I love going back, it&#x27;s a bit pricey for lotion!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then comes this...couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I am liking  this hand cream very much. The fragrance is not too strong and I use it at bed time to keep my hands from cracking. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> yes ! Love Love Love this cream.</li>
    <li> Added this to order, so there would be some on hand.  Always carry a tube in my purse.  Excellent moisturizer.</li>
