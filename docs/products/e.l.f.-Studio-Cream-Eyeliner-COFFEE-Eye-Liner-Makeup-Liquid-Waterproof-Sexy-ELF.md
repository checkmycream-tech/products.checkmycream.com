      <li>perfect.</li>
      <li>Works best wife angled eye pencil.</li>
      <li>Makes my eyebrows look perfect.</li>
      <li>Great price, great pigment, great staying power.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>All I hear is how great this type of eyeliner</li>
      <li>A great liner</li>
      <li>The brush that comes with it is perfect, you can get a very fine line or go bolder.</li>
      <li>Thank you for this bit of gorgeousness that I can feel good about (all of e.l.f.&#x27;s products are cruelty-free).</li>
      <li>Good color.  </li>
      <li>I guess it takes a more  experienced person.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is perfect and it comes with the right brush</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more!</li>
      <li>, I still use it very very sparingly for my brows but it also works great as a liner.</li>
      <li>The product itself is okay....</li>
      <li>I would recommend it for the color which I love.  </li>
      <li>This cream eye liner is a lot better</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
      <li>So if you are looking for a more daytime/natural look, you may want to opt for a lighter shade.</li>
      <li>but I am here to tell everyone that this makeup is cheap and does not go on evenly!</li>
      <li>This is everything an eyeliner should be: pigmented in one application, creamy, easy to work with and long-lasting (for $3 on the ELF website).</li>
      <li>easy and smooth to apply</li>
      <li>This is great stuff, especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money great to do eyebrows cheaper alternative to Anastasia dipbrow will repurchase over and over again definitely recommend</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the look, feel, ease of use and philosophical manufacturing and production of this cosmetic.</li>
      <li>Super creamy and very very pigmented.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color that works great as liner and as a colored base that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Somehow the quality of this one was not as good as the exact one that I got in black.</li>
      <li>This particular one was received all dried up, but the seller did great at refunding me immediately.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t quote last all day but love it.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t get a straight line</li>
      <li>It does not seem to really do the job very well.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and it wasn&#x27;t too dry or caked up.</li>
      <li>It may take a bit of getting used to if you normally use pencils that require a lot of pressure to fill in.</li>
      <li>I am new to this type of eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>I find it easier to use with an angled eyeliner brush, but the tiny brush it comes with is also workable, just make sure not to load it too much, otherwise you&#x27;ll get no color from the tip of the brush and two parallel black lines from the edges.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and it is very smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>so much easier to use than a pencil, it doesn&#x27;t drag when applying to the lid</li>
      <li>This one inexplicably smudges more than the other one and does not apply smoothly.</li>
      <li>Normally, I use Clinique where you wet the brush with water.  </li>
      <li>This liner is very thick and easy to apply.</li>

<li> This liner is very thick and easy to apply.</li>
<li> but I use it to fill in my brows its cheaper than Anastasia Beverly hills and does the job the same way also a little goes a long way and it lasts all day</li>
<li> and if I do then it is too wide a line.  </li>
<li> I purchased this makeup based on all the other reviews.....</li>
<li> I only gave it three stars because of how hard it is to use, but give it a five for color.</li>
<li> And, good grief!</li>
<li> Because it is so thick, the brown almost looks black.  </li>
<li> It requires some steadiness to get a thin line, but it comes out looking very dark.  </li>
<li> times, after extended wear, it can smudge a little bit under the eye, but nothing dramatic.</li>
<li> so you won&#x27;t have to make a mess using a wrong one.</li>
<li> Not sure if this is just a bad one that I got or what.</li>
<li> It smears and transfers like crazy.</li>
<li> the method of application is terrible and the storage of the applicator brush doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>

    <li> This cream eye liner is a lot better that liquid ones because you can draw the line over the eyelid 10 times easier. The consistency is perfect and it comes with the right brush so you won&#x27;t have to make a mess using a wrong one. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product itself is okay....the method of application is terrible and the storage of the applicator brush doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with the look, feel, ease of use and philosophical manufacturing and production of this cosmetic. Thank you for this bit of gorgeousness that I can feel good about (all of e.l.f.&#x27;s products are cruelty-free). And, good grief! The price! (soooooooooo affordable). How could anyone who loves glam and bunnies and her pocketbook resist?</li>
    <li> It does not seem to really do the job very well.</li>
    <li> This liner is very thick and easy to apply. It may take a bit of getting used to if you normally use pencils that require a lot of pressure to fill in. A little goes a long way and it is very smooth and soft. It requires some steadiness to get a thin line, but it comes out looking very dark.  That&#x27;s the only grip I have. Because it is so thick, the brown almost looks black.  So if you are looking for a more daytime/natural look, you may want to opt for a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> A great liner but I use it to fill in my brows its cheaper than Anastasia Beverly hills and does the job the same way also a little goes a long way and it lasts all day</li>
    <li> Whatever line you put above your lashes will show up again over your shadow. It smears and transfers like crazy.</li>
    <li> Somehow the quality of this one was not as good as the exact one that I got in black. This one inexplicably smudges more than the other one and does not apply smoothly. Not sure if this is just a bad one that I got or what.</li>
    <li> I purchased this makeup based on all the other reviews.....but I am here to tell everyone that this makeup is cheap and does not go on evenly! This particular one was received all dried up, but the seller did great at refunding me immediately. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this brand even for my 5 y/o granddaughter to play with! If you want to buy discounted makeup ....stick with Maybelline or Loreal.</li>
    <li> Worth the money great to do eyebrows cheaper alternative to Anastasia dipbrow will repurchase over and over again definitely recommend</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. Will order again once it is gone</li>
    <li> easy and smooth to apply</li>
    <li> Good color.  I am new to this type of eyeliner.  Normally, I use Clinique where you wet the brush with water.  I just can not get it even.  All I hear is how great this type of eyeliner this is but I can&#x27;t get a straight line and if I do then it is too wide a line.  Is it the brush?  I would recommend it for the color which I love.  I guess it takes a more  experienced person.  I only gave it three stars because of how hard it is to use, but give it a five for color.</li>
    <li> Works best wife angled eye pencil. Doesn&#x27;t quote last all day but love it.</li>
    <li> perfect. comes with angled brush. I use for my eyebrows</li>
    <li> Super creamy and very very pigmented. I wanted to use this as an eyebrow liner but it turned out to be quite a bit darker than I&#x27;d hoped, I still use it very very sparingly for my brows but it also works great as a liner. Great price, great pigment, great staying power.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints. It goes on smoothly and it wasn&#x27;t too dry or caked up. I will be ordering more!</li>

I find it easier to use with an angled eyeliner brush, but the tiny brush it comes with is also workable, just make sure not to load it too much, otherwise you&#x27;ll get no color from the tip of the brush and two parallel black lines from the edges. I have super-watery eyes and it times, after extended wear, it can smudge a little bit under the eye, but nothing dramatic. I&#x27;ll keep buying this!</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my eyebrows look perfect.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, especially for the price.  The brush that comes with it is perfect, you can get a very fine line or go bolder.</li>
