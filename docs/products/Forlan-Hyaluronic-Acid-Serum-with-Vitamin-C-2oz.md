<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product! Goes on easily and dries quickly so there&#x27;s no waiting to put on your moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have received my hyaluronic acid serum.  I am using it twice daily and looking for results soon.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be great but unfortunately for me it made me breakout in cystic acne! It also dried my skin out horribly and I only used it once a day as twice a day was going to be way to much! I hoped this was going to work but I don&#x27;t need anymore adult acne especially cystic</li>
    <li> Forlan offers a Hyaluronic Acid that is not your typical blend. The serum contains a healthy mixture of Vitamin A, C, D and also Vitamin E. This anti aging moisturizer comes in a nice bottle with a pump action top, so oxidation is kept at a minimum with zero light and minimal air exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid, is found in greater quantity in younger skin&#x27;s cells and is attributed to that smooth, elastic and beautiful skin. HA provides moisture to the cells, almost a drowning effect that allows the surface to hold up to 1000 times it&#x27;s water weight, so you get a nice plump that smooths out fine lines and wrinkles. See it as your skin getting it&#x27;s 8 glasses of water a day but on the surface!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin A- A retnoid that helps boost collagen and aids in resurfacing of the skin, meaning you plump the layers below and quicken the turn-over process. Your older layer is shed but you are left with smoother looking skin that appears more flawless than before. It takes time and regular use to see greater results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E- An antioxidant and a very rich moisturizer. The oil tends to remain on the skin longer, thus providing longer protection. Studies have shown that Vitamin E combined with Vitamin C, may give the skin a level of &amp;#34;sun protection&amp;#34;. Vitamin E also defends against free-radicals and helps with inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;I applied the Forlan Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a period of 3 weeks; twice a day, both day and at night. I washed my face and this was the second step of my daily skincare routine. I followed up with make-up and on the weekends with just sunscreen. I discontinued used of all other products and this included my retinols. I will say the simplification process was appreciated because this is an all-in-one product. You can follow-up with a moisturizer but 80% of time, I felt that the serum was enough for me. It satisfied my skin&#x27;s needs by keeping it moisturized and protected. I did not experience any blemish or acne breakouts, or even clogged pores, so that also convinced me to keep using the serum as-is without adding anything else. My routine was cut in half and I found myself sort of feeling like I was forgetting to put something else on my face but by week two, I was liking this short-cut. The formula may be a short-cut in steps but not when it comes to delivering results. I had a nice glow that made me stop using my highlighter powder and a girl likes it when she can glow all on her own. My cheeks were smooth and I did encourage the resurfacing process by exfoliating twice a week. I was hesitant about the Vitamin E because the oil can be heavy at times and cause irritation but I did not experience any adverse effects. I think as the days get colder and Winter is upon us, the Vitamin is E is more welcoming than anything. I was very satisfied with the results and how well this all-in-one product performed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Forlan Advanced Skincare.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

    <li> This item from FORLAN is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleasently surprised at how much I like this specific serum. I&#x27;ve tryed countless different moisturizers, and serums; and found a flaw with just about every last one, this isn&#x27;t the case with this serum. It comes in a bottle with a push down pump, so just the right amount comes out, And the directions/suggested use as well as the ingredients are extremely easy to see and understand. With the benefits of vitamin A, C, D, &amp; E along with Aloe barbadensis, witch hazel, MSM, Potassium, and lavender oil and the technology that Forlan brings to you, you&#x27;ll know this is the right choice for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now-an-days it&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s best for our skin, and most women don&#x27;t have the financial means to pay for expensive surgery(s) or borox, this is a great alternative. It really can rewind the clock of time; when used as directed, I suggest purchasing this along side of there eye serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I LOVE about the bottle is the generous size. This would also be a good gift along with there eye serum and daily moisturizer. For the best results I would go with all three!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I want to talk briefly about my personal use... I really like the subtle clean scent; that&#x27;s perfect for men or women. This formula hydrates my dry skin while leaving a radiant glow; without the greasy feeling some other serums may have... My skin has a smoother younger feel and look, I would be thrilled with just thoes results, but as I&#x27;ve said Forlan as out-done themselves (AGAIN) this also helps diminish the signs of age by reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, crows feet, and one of my favorite features I&#x27;ve seen first hand; acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommended buying this, so you can see first hand the AMAZING effects and benefits you&#x27;ve been missing out on, I&#x27;ll guarantee you will be a return buyer, like I know I will be!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel and look fresher.  Gives a nice glow to the complexion.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does what it says it will do.Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Forlan Hyaluronic Acid Serum has erased the veins that were appearing by my temples as well as reduce my laugh lines and furrows. I use it under my Origins drink up overnight mask which, keeps in moisture and plumps up my skin. The combination of the two has made my skin look years younger. I am waiting for my next shipment of this serum to arrive. I will be 51 next month and still get carded. Love it!!</li>
    <li> one of the best products I have tried!  Immediate results and continuous improvement as I use daily.  I only wish the packaging was more environment friendly, currently it is not recyclable.</li>
    <li> I order added this product to my friend purchase so we wold have free shipping, I wanted to leave a review since I used it before and after a derma roller treatment, at first I felt it was drying too fast and left my face super tight? I waited a few minutes and immediately felt my face good, I applied again right before the derma roller treatment, I did it a few times after I finished my treatment for comfort. it helped my face to cool off and refresh.  I just used it for a week so I hope I get nice results after using it for a while.</li>
    <li> Very nice. I liked Lt very much. It firms and tighten the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Hyaluronic Acid Serum for approximately 20 days. Even if you don&#x27;t have aging problems, this is one of the best serums I have put on my skin in quite a while. Yes, I am almost 43 (with new wrinkles popping up everyday) and live in a very dry, hot climate so my skin will be dryer than say a 20 year old living in a humid climate but I guarantee you, your skin will be thanking you for putting this serum on it. We did have quite a bit of rain in the past week so it tended to get more muggy outside than usual. When it does get like that, any serums plus the moisturizer I have on usually just says &amp;#34;I&#x27;m done&amp;#34; and melts off of my face. With the hyaluronic acid serum, the more muggy it got, the softer my skin got. It wasn&#x27;t melting off my face but it seemed as though it was absorbing into my skin more. I loved that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid is huge on the skin care scene, but the reason I love it so much is the results I&#x27;ve had with anything with Hyaluronic Acid in it. It&#x27;s like a miracle ingredient. It takes very few days to start seeing an improvement in your skin, so you know it&#x27;s a rapidly working ingredient and it is very gentle on your skin. I use this serum a couple of times a day. First, in the morning right after I have cleaned my skin and then again at night after taking all of my makeup off and cleansing my skin again. Both times, I&#x27;ve put the serum on right before my moisturizer goes on. Just using it two times a day, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin already looks five years younger. You wouldn&#x27;t think I&#x27;m out in the sun for a majority of my day. Something I do to cut down on steps with my makeup routine, is to mix the Hyaluronic Acid Serum with my moisturizer. I use equal parts of both. I find I don&#x27;t have to wait for the serum to dry before adding moisturizer. I know that it only takes about a minute to dry but some mornings, it&#x27;s just that kind of morning. I oversleep and you can bet your butt that is the morning I&#x27;m going to realize I&#x27;m out of coffee. You don&#x27;t have to add it to your moisturizer, I just find it&#x27;s a quick shortcut that works for me. It also doesn&#x27;t leave that very shiny look on your face like some serums often do. It&#x27;s more of a matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne, this is a fabulous product to have. It has witch hazel in it so it acts as a cleansing agent without drying out your skin. I love Forlan Skincare because they really stand behind their products. If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with your purchase, they will refund your money 100% with no questions asked. They also do not test their products on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.ut of coffee. You don&#x27;t have to add it to your moisturizer, I just find it&#x27;s a quick shortcut that works for me. It also doesn&#x27;t leave that very shiny look on your face like some serums often do. It&#x27;s more of a matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne, this is a fabulous product to have. It has witch hazel in it so it acts as a cleansing agent without drying out your skin.

    <li> The first time I used this product the fine lines on my face seemed to vanish - well almost.  It really did make a difference and put my more expensive lancome serum to shame.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results for the price and will re-order when I run out.</li>
    <li> Just bought this product &amp; I&#x27;m really happy. I love the slight tightening feeling when you apply it first.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even receive some complements 😀</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 days now and so far it&#x27;s great, my skin feels more firm and some of the fine lines are less visible.</li>
    <li> When I use this product, I can feel a tightening of my skin.  I have, however, not noticed a glaring improvement in the wrinkles in my face, esp. the deep lines between the eyes and between lips and nose.  I am 74 years old, but I have used facial skincare products (usually Olay) since my 30&#x27;s and have been told many times over the years that I do not look my age.  I&#x27;m optimistically giving the Hyaluronic Acid Serum a few more weeks to show marked improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, it made my skin a little red but I&#x27;m thinking with use my skin will get used to it.</li>
    <li> This is one of those 2 in 1 types of products. I love all the ingredients in this product and how it moisturizes. It is great as a light moisturizer but I have not seen much &amp;#34;natural glow&amp;#34; results. I&#x27;ve been reviewing this one for about 2-3 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any huge improvement in my skin tone or my older imperfections (scars, discolorations, uneven texture etc.). Results have been very subtle but I have seen the great moisturizing results. The pump applicator is great and the packaging is decent. I enjoy the logo of the product very much as well, the leaf is clever. The product itself is kind of a mix between a liquidity lotion and a thicker cream. I would apply this after washing my face and toner (if used). I have used this product only once a day in the evening as my moisturizer or under my moisturizer (using this as a serum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall I would recommend this to someone new to anti-aging or something of that sort. This product isn&#x27;t super strong (would be excellent for sensitive skin as well) and can be great as a first step into anti-aging. It is great for that, subtle results while providing great moisture from your usual facial moisturizer. The scent is also very nice, also very light in my opinion so great for sensitive skin as well! I hope you all check it out, it is currently $20 which is a great price for a moisturizer/serum type of product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review, all words are mine*</li>
    <li> I am so thankful that I have been on the receiving end of some really great products lately.  This Hyaluronic Acid Serum that Forlan Skincare sent me to review for them is one of them!&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid has made quite a name for itself in the anti aging skincare world and for good reason!&lt;br /&gt;I use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum everyday and I apply it to my face (including the eye area), neck, decollete and even my shoulders.  This serum from Forlan Skincare is lightweight, non-greasy and absorbs really quickly.  It perfectly hydrates and leaves my skin feeling super soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application. You don&#x27;t want to use this in lieu of a moisturizer (serums are meant to be applied underneath serum). Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin. make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the vitamins in the serum; it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums. The vitamins in this are ideal for promoting skin cell turnover and diminishing free radical damage so you really want to take full advantage of that by prepping your skin. I did a comparison of my moisturizer using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the third product from this company that I&#x27;ve used, and they are consistently high quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate this as &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34;. I received this product necessary to facilitate my honest review. No other forms of payment were or will be received.</li>
    <li> made my skin feel dry</li>
    <li> Not doing what it said it would...</li>
    <li> I love using this serum under my morning SPF moisturizer in the mornings and in conjunction with my night repair creams before I hit the bed. It works really well in ensuring that my skin retains the moisture that I need and I especially love it because it makes a big difference when I apply my makeup. I solely used moisturizers in the past, but it has not really worked for me. I really hate it when I have dry patches of skin that makeup products cling to. Needless to say, I am very happy when I found a combo that gets rid of those dry patches that I truly hate! It is highly moisturizing, yet surprisingly not greasy - my kind of serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> It feels great, but I have yet to see big changes...but I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> It was delivered when it was supposed to.  So far I really like it. It has a clean feel and makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I really love this product</li>
    <li> no better than oil of Olay or the new product called No7</li>
    <li> Just got the Forlan Skincare my skin already after 3 days seems brighter and more healthy. can&#x27;t wait to buy more of your wonderful products.</li>
    <li> I like it so far. I have only used it 5 days as the shipment did not arrive on the scheduled time.As it dries, the product has a tightening effect and I like that and hopefully it will be tightening the skin in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it a 4 only because I have not had enough time to seriously evaluate the product.&lt;br /&gt;I will gladly update my review after a month&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> Really have not seen any difference in my skin other than it feels somewhat tight immediately after using</li>
    <li> I really have not used it long enough, so far so good.  It doesn&#x27;t stink like the one I threw out.</li>
    <li> At first I thought I noticed a difference. But after 4 weeks of consistent use I really couldn&#x27;t see any demonstrable changes. Adding one more step to my morning/evening routine with no obvious results is not for this girl.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It goes right into your skin. And although I have only used it about a week. I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This product has worked well on my wrinkled lose skin I use it on my arms and legs. I lost 140 lbs a few years ago and don&#x27;t have the money to have treatment to help the apparence look better so I researched this and I also use procellix gel which has been working good for 6 months now. They worked out a deal with me because I was running out because I use it 2 times a day on several areas for my lose skin. I ran out of this product as well for the same reasons. I would love to order this again if you could also work out something that&#x27;s not pricy and I don&#x27;t run out. If you can help please let me know. Thank you, Maury Giffin I don&#x27;t use this product on my face I don&#x27;t need it there yet I am 44 and blessed to still look 36.</li>
    <li> I was able to tell right of the bat, without question, that this serum is less hydrating than other serums I&#x27;ve tried. I applied it to my skin and it immediately evaporated, it was like I hadn&#x27;t applied anything, except for the slight stinging. I believe the stinging is from the Vitamin C in the serum; I usually experience the same stinging when using a Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now initially I thought, uh oh, I got dud, but I noticed my skin had more moisture later, instead of sooner. Not dewy by any means, but there was more moisture then when I originally applied the serum. I guess there is something to that pulling moisture from the environment thing because it pulled it from somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this product for a short while, about a week, I did not see any improvement with my wrinkles or fine lines, but enough time has not passed for all that. I did notice that my skin is smoother and less red. I believe this product has really good possibilities! I will most likely be refilling this moisturizer, because the success I&#x27;ve had in this short amount of time is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item received in exchange for review. All reviews, whether self-purchased or provided for review, will be completely honest.</li>
    <li> this is the wife that uses it.&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t been that long. Maybe a week.&lt;br /&gt;so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any change.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou</li>
    <li> It seems that hi tech serums are the latest thing in every woman&#x27;s beauty regime, so I thought I should get in on it. This serum seems to fulfill its promises. It smells nice, it is clear and it absorbs well into my face and neck. It seems to tighten my skin a little when it is absorbing, then when I put my moisturiser on top, all I can say is that my skin feels silky soft. It seems very good value to me, I&#x27;ve paid much more in the past for much less product. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped so quickly and was packaged well! Love the design of the bottle and how it dispenses. The product is nice, in that it absorbs nicely into the skin. Feel like I need to use a little bit more product because of that. Just after a few days of using it I noticed my acne scarred skin looking a bit more smooth with a slight glow. I like that the product is at a good price point for how much you receive. Look forward to seeing the continued results!</li>
    <li> My order arrived later than expected, so I have only used it for five days.  It is easily applied and gives a nice fresh feeling to my face.  Lotion and make-up seems to go on smoother.</li>
    <li> Have just begun using it and love it. Have tried a number of other products in all price ranges and this is the best! It is easily absorbed into my skin with no greasy residue, leaving my skin soft and smooth. Am eager to see what improvement lies ahead with continued use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a admit a week, but can already tell that the little lines around my eyes are softening. Was a great price!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Amazing!  NON greasy, fantastic item. Better than any $100 cream</li>
    <li> If you are like me, you want to try the latest and greatest in skin care products. Yes, I&#x27;m only in my mid twenties but it is never too early to take care of your skin. When I saw the positive reviews for this serum, I just had to have it. From the time of order to delivery, the product was shipped quickly and got here in perfect condition. Now I have only been using it for 3 days and I usually use it for 2-3 weeks before I write a review but I&#x27;ve already had great results so I had to share. My husband even said I look like I have a glow to my skin. It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy and it absorbs nicely without any residue. The scent is pleasant. Not over powering and not fake smelling, just natural. For the size, I think the price is just right. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an addition to their beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Can I just say how much I ADORE the bottle? It is skinny and long as apposed to the more stout, rounder bottles we usually see and it makes it that more appealing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it is also an air pump pleases me. I love it when the product is easy to get out. The serum is a clear liquid that is not to thick and not to thin and a little goes a long way. There is a smell to it but it is nice and not industrial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found with this that I did not need to put a ton of moisturizer on afterwards since this did not dry  my skin out like most serums. It gave my skin a nice plump feeling and worked well under my makeup too. This bottle will last you a while if you only use a tiny bit daily, really you do not need more than that! As for anti-ageing, I am only 28 so I do not need to worry about that just yet, but it is nice to get a head start!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
    <li> I just received this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will start using it as directed.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it will be as good as described.&lt;br /&gt;I will let you know.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Maria</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly and was very well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with this serum, it feels really nice on my face and was easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is great quality and has clear instructions for use.</li>
    <li> Good product...could not tell enough difference to give it a 5.  I was already other</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product to buy .</li>

My skin is smoother and has a new &#x27;glow&#x27; to it!&lt;br /&gt;This price is AMAZING. It&#x27;s hard to find a good Hyaluronic acid serum for a good price</li>
    <li> I waited purposely to give a review because I wanted it to be based on long-term results.  Well, after six weeks of use, I can say that I love it and have noticed a difference in my skin tone and overall appearance. This product is definitely and permanent fixture in my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I Love this serum, its the best product I&#x27;ve purchased. I have seen exceptional results in just 1 week.  Thank you for this absolutely Great Product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE ONLY USED THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS NO COMMENT YET</li>
    <li> This clear gel product comes in a great easy-to-apply pump dispenser.  The serum has a light texture &amp; absorbs into &amp; glides easily onto the skin.  It makes my clean face sparkle!  I like the way it tightens my skin before I put on moisturizer.  Also this product can be used under the eyes!  Overall I am enjoying my skin feeling &amp; appearing smoother &amp; more even.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for about one week, but so far it is great!!</li>
    <li> So far I really love using this product!! I have been using it for a few days and love the look of my skin. Hopefully it will keep my skin looking healthy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is unbelievable... I&#x27;ve never been happy with any moisturizers. My skin is a difficult mix of dry and oily, and after two days of using this I feel like I&#x27;m made of silk. Amazing stuff, amazing deal. So happy!</li>
    <li> Love it I been using in for the past 3 weeks, I can see my skin is more firm around my jaw. I&#x27;m very please with this product. MZ</li>
    <li> As with other products I have bought in skin care ranges I needed to try this latest thing to see if it really does what it says. I am pleased to say that having bought the item a couple of weeks ago I am really pleased with the results. The item arrived quickly and is definitely easy to use with a great pump style bottle. You can feel the serum tighten your skin as you put it on and it is really easily absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended to anyone who cares about their skin and wants a product that does as it says it does!!</li>
    <li> I like this product, I feel my face more soft and uniform. thanks</li>
    <li> When you think of taking vitamins, you do not typically think about your skin. Vitamins are essential to maintain not only your inner health, but your outer health as well. This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is packed full of vitamins!! Providing your skin with the proper care and nutrients will aid in slowing the aging process and protecting it from harsh environmental factors. My favorite part of my skincare routine is my Hyaluronic Acid Serum application! It leaves my skin feeling like silk and boosts the effectiveness of my other skincare products. This serum has a pleasant, light scent and wears nicely under makeup. I always allow about 10 minutes in between each product application, just to ensure i am not removing one product while applying another. Although the Hyaluronic Acid Serum doubles as a moisturizer, it is not heavy like other brands and is quickly absorbed by my skin. I love that it does not leave my face looking oily or greasy. I tend to struggle with finding products that do not irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin, but this has worked wonders for me with no negative side effects. Forlan&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum has drastically improved my skin&#x27;s appearance and makes me feel more confident about leaving the house with no makeup on. Remember, it does not matter how much makeup you apply if you are not starting with a good, clean canvas! This product has so many great benefits: Anti-aging properties, doubles as moisturizer, firms and tones skin, fades dark spots, tightens eye areas, and it is made in the USA!! I am so happy with the results i have received from using Forlan&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum and i would suggest this product to anyone who asked me:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> Been using for a full week, now. I&#x27;m a dude that wants to look fresh and balanced. This Serum is doing its trick. Face feels smother, and I&#x27;ve noticed a bit less crows around my eyes too. Goes on smooth and light</li>
    <li> First, item was delivered almost instantly ;-)&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply with the pump function and it feels very refreshing, once applied&lt;br /&gt;I can feel serum tingling and tightening my skin and it is easily absorbed, with no residue left visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good value. I&#x27;ve seen and paid much more for somewhat inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> it takes time but it made miracle ! I&#x27;m 69 years old but most of my wrinkles are gone!</li>
    <li> Feels nice on my face, soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Is more of a moisturizing serum then an anti aging moisturizer. Did not improve my fine lines after 6 weeks of consistent use.</li>
    <li> I am finding this product too strong for my face.  It has hurt the skin around my eyes and I have had to discontinue its use.</li>
    <li> I saw improvement and clarity in my skin in about two weeks</li>
    <li> Dont feel moisture as i thought it would be contrary i felt my skin dyhidrated</li>
    <li> I received the product promptly after purchase . It is well packaged within a pump bottle . The application instructions are clear . It absorbs nicely into the skin and you can feel the active ingredients getting to work with a slight tingle . However I have only been using my the product for just over a week and as a trained therapist need to use it for 5 to 6 weeks to give a full review on its results .... Therefore I will re review then .... but lovely product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial creams over the years.  Some have impressed me and others not so much.  Many of the serums I&#x27;ve tried have been thick, greasy and difficult to apply.  Not this one I&#x27;m pleased to say.  It&#x27;s smooth going on and not greasy in the least.  I like how it absorbs right into the skin without effort and is thick enough not to run down my face as I&#x27;m applying it.  I have noticed that my skin gets a little red initially, but the redness disappears within just a few minutes, leaving dry, smooth skin.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice anti-aging facial cream.  It&#x27;s also free of gluten, which is great for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness! I have NEVER recieved an online order so fast!! I, literally, received it in less than 36 hours from the minute I placed my order. Wow. Very impressive! I had just ran out of my old serum, so it was perfect timing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days, so I can&#x27;t give my full, honest opinion right now. I&#x27;ll come back later and provide an updated review, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that this serum is a little thicker than my usual one. It&#x27;s more of a gel, which I like. It makes it easier to apply and manipulate. My face does feel a little tight, when I first apply it. But that goes away fast. It has a very light, pleasant lavender scent too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is awesome! I paid the same amount for my old serum. BUT, this product is almost twice the size. Oh, I did notice that the bottle says it&#x27;s 2 ounces but, in parentheses states its 50ml. 2 ounces is closer to 60ml, from what I understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ll be back to tell you how well the product works on my fine lines and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product about 2 week.  It is wonderful  and I smooth make up on very carefully not to disturb it.  It really smooths out  on my cheeks; but I need to work on my forehead and around my mouth.  Maybe in a little while all will be better.  I am hopeful.  I live in a very, very dry, cold and windy climate.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I am turning 50 this year and have been using product since last November, it helps alot.</li>
    <li> Actually my wife loves it. I personally don&#x27;t use it, but I can tell the difference in the glow of her skin, therefore I wrote this review. I love the price myself.</li>
    <li> I ma very happy with the product and service.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I&#x27;ve noticed that my pores are smaller. Also my skin looks younger. I&#x27;ve spent plenty on more expensive products that did not produce results as fast as this serum. This will definitely be my life long product. You still have to cover with a moisturizer . I Starter using this HAS about six weeks ago and I&#x27;m very impressed. You cld use two pumps twice a day but I love to feel the product so I ise three pumps twice a day so it probly won&#x27;t last me as long. I&#x27;m 32 and have used my moisturizer morning and night faithfully so my lines aren&#x27;t too bad but even tho the serum is minimizing those too. It&#x27;s now my favorite product that I refuse to run out of just saying.....</li>
    <li> I have been using this, along with Moisturize 911 by Perfectly Posh(www.poshmiapril.com) and my skin looks much better!  The little lines and darkness under my eyes have improved!  I have only used this serum for about 3 weeks.</li>
