      <li>I have been using this product for a few years and the first paragraph on the back of the bottle normally states that it removes DHT.  </li>

    <li> This is great stuff. I love the way it really cleans my hair without drying it out.  Used with the conditioner, I have seen new growth of short hair that helps fill in the thin areas.</li>
    <li> My wife was very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo for my hair.  It helps my hair to shine and look healthier and fuller than other shampoos have.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.  It may be right for YOU!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Nioxin line of products for years.  I started using it when my very fine hair began thinning during the summer months. I noticed a dramatic change following the use of the Nioxin products.  My fine treated hair feels and looks very thick and I no longer lose the large quantities of hair that I once did.  This product really works.</li>
    <li> Has vastly improved the texture and thickness of my husbands hair. He is very satisfied with this product. Buys on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to this product because as a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; woman, I am losing hair each time I shampoo. I will say that I am not losing as much hair whilst I shampoo, but it is still collecting in my hairbrush as I comb through. I have only shampooed 3 times, so I think I will need to use this product a whole lot more before I really give a concrete opinion. Thus far I am satisfied and the wonderful smell of peppermint permeates the shower beautifully when I use this shampoo. Just to advise, I lather up and leave this on my head for a couple of minutes while I shower and then rinse off everything together, as it were. I am hoping this works at keeping my hair on my head and not in the brush.</li>
    <li> The featured product does not appear to be what I received.  I have been using this product for a few years and the first paragraph on the back of the bottle normally states that it removes DHT.  The cap is normally gold as shown in the ad.  However, the bottles I purchased have a darker blackish cap and there is no mention of removing DHT on the back of the bottle.</li>
    <li> My wife used the Bosley hair system for a couple of years.  While Bosley was great for awhile, her hair suddenly started to loose hair with each shampooing.  She switched to Nioxin and the hair loss stopped completely.  Her hair seems to be in good condition and has a healthy shine.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser highly recommended this product.  It is expensive and I am not exactly sure it is really doing the job it advertises.  But it can&#x27;t hurt. And  I can&#x27;t buy it in my  home country, so I order it l online.</li>
    <li> Nioxin has helped my hair become healthier with no more noticible thinning. I use their whole line of products and have been very pleased. You do need to be consistent with using it for the best results.</li>
    <li> does the hair good even see some new hairs growing in</li>
    <li> wonderful loved it thank you</li>
    <li> I have used before.  It helps with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This does seem to make a difference in how much hair you lose.  Also seems to start growing baby hair around your hairline.  I quit using it and I&#x27;ve noticed the difference so I&#x27;ve had to buy a new bottle.</li>
    <li> Being over 40 my hair was getting a little thin, tried this Vioxin shampoo and it really thickened my hair, this has to be either my third or fourth bottle, for the price this stuff works well, and my girfriend and the ladies at work noticed as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using nioxin for two years. My hair was breaking and falling out due to stress and menopause.  Now my hair has a thicker feel and is stronger and no longer breaking.  its also shiny and stopped falling out.  Also taking good hair vitamins is needed for hair problems</li>
    <li> I found no help from this product. My dermatologist said there is not enough medication in this shampoo for real results. (P.S. Using Rogaine is no better. While that product will show some results, discontinuing its use will result in the new hair falling out.) Go to a medical professional! Save time, money, and the stress of these products.</li>
    <li> Love this - clean hair and scalp</li>
    <li> this is what i was looking for. i&#x27;m using it for 3 years in a row, and i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great Price &amp; I have thinning hair and this seems to help. Tired other things and am sticking to this. Has a fresh clean scent.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I can  tell that my hair loss has lessened dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this highly to anyone with menopausal hair loss.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the pepperminty scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 9 months, with no positive results.  It smells good, but that&#x27;s about it.  I noticed my hair loss actually increase fairly significantly over this time.  Not that this caused it, but it certainly didn&#x27;t help.  On to something else.</li>
