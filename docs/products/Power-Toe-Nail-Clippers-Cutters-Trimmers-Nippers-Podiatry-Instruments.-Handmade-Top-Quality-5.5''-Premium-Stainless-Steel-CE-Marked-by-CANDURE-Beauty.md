<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> much better than a clipper</li>
    <li> Worked great on my toughest talons!</li>
    <li> NICE weight Sharpe blade........</li>
    <li> Clippers are great. I give them an awesome five star. Great buy</li>
    <li> Got here quick, they are very durable. I recommend !!!!</li>
    <li> Should have paid attention to the previous review. There are so many issues in the quality that it is essentially useless. I hate to waste my time trying to get my refund.</li>
    <li> works pretty well on my 9-inch (thick) nails.</li>
    <li> These must have been assembled in a manufacturing hut WAY too close to the poppy fields. Obviously made by hand, parts mismatched, duller than a politician&#x27;s wit.&lt;br /&gt;Seller wanted me to foot the bill for return, (like I&#x27;d give them another chance to resell them to another sucker), which would have been more than they were worth in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and stick to items sold by Amazon. Amazon has an unbeatable return policy.</li>
    <li> This item fell short of my expectations.  To be clear, it looks great very similar to one I have from W. Germany, but it is NOT German engineering nor does it cut like you would expect.  It does not cut clean, does not seem to be sharp and after trying it a few times I am ready to return it for another one just to be fair as it just may be a bad device.  It is very solid in its construction, but they missed the boat on how to sharpen it correctly.  Save your money or hope for better engineering.</li>
    <li> What you pay for is what you get. Pay for a better quality product.</li>
    <li> Well built and constructed.  Cuts easily.</li>
    <li> hard to squeeze, not reliable product</li>
    <li> seem to work well but can&#x27;t use on all toenails becaude too small</li>
    <li> good quality and good price and  also prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Not too easy to break!</li>
    <li> Just ok. Great for $6. I&#x27;m sure better quality to be had.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than old regular clippers.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected. Excellent quality, good price.</li>
    <li> Mine don&#x27;t cut worth a crap, I&#x27;m going to put the hone on it and see if I can sharpen them.  They&#x27;re useless as received.</li>
    <li> Very, very dull cutting edge. Barely usable.</li>
    <li> OK at first, but the cutting edges were chipped and dulled quickly</li>
    <li> Does as is expected.  Drawback is that spring mechanism and all metal makes it sometimes difficult to grip tight enough to finish clip.  Would maybe be better with a rubber grip.</li>
    <li> Better quality than I expected for the price, very pleased</li>
    <li> These take care of some extra thick nails I have and also helped with a damaged nail I had that I couldn&#x27;t get with regular nail cutters.</li>
    <li> They cut and work great. My only complaint is they wont lock.</li>
    <li> These arrived very quickly, and are well-made.  The spring works perfectly.  I&#x27;d been looking in stores for a long time, finally gave up and ordered on-line.  These completely meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> My toes love it!  Heavy duty tool</li>
    <li> Not very sharp and awkward.  Poor locking mechanism</li>
    <li> Got these for my mother and she said they were exactly what she was looking for. She says they work well and likes the spring and how well they handle. Because of her arthritis tools that are easier on her hands and work well are important for her.</li>
    <li> The blades were too dull to even cut through a thread, let alone a thick toenail. The case these were shipped in had dirt and filth in it. Just the kind of sanitary object I want to put near my feet. The lock mechanism gets stuck and the small bar that holds it in place broke and fell off within 3 minutes of owning this hunk of junk. I know this clipper is tempting because of the price, but it&#x27;s not even worth the $6.50 I paid for it. Returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> I mean... it works... but, feels cheap... and the center spring doesn&#x27;t really work... you have to kindda manually open it and close it.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers for thick nails. Wide opening and sharp blades make them easy and efficient to use. Be careful, they are sharp!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> precision nail cutting instrument...Love how these cut</li>
    <li> do the job great . yes every one needs one .!</li>
    <li> poor quality control allows a nail clipper that does not have sharp cutting edges. Flat , dull cutting edge just crushes the nail instead of cutting as it should. Very unhappy with this item as it not usable. Not what I expect from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Able to cut hard nails on my toes without any problem.</li>
    <li> hard for arthritic hands to use</li>
    <li> they work really good they cut very good the only problem is they don&#x27;t close the clip is very difficult to close</li>
    <li> Hard to cut with these. Must squeeze hard.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t cut, they are extremely dull</li>
    <li> This is a very fine looking gadget, but only fair at cutting nails, particularly a rather thick nail on my left big toe.  However, it does an excellent job of cutting the toe itself.  Either the handle should be longer or some other means of increasing leverage on the cutting blades.  Of course I will be 90 next month and had at least one disabling stroke last year, so perhaps I&#x27;m not quite the man I used to be.</li>
    <li> Confession: I actually use these to cut the tangled hair out of my vacuums. It works great! Long blade and sharp so it cuts through hair easily. I know it isn&#x27;t what it was made for, but just wanted to give credit anyway.</li>
    <li> the spring action in the clippers isn&#x27;t smooth but i hope they loosen up with time. The quality is good but not outstanding for a pair of almost 20.00 clippers</li>
    <li> Best clippers money can buy!</li>
    <li> Clippers are not even sharp.</li>
    <li> The clippers are supposed to open after making a cut. These clippers are so stiff that the spring in the handles is totally ineffective to push the handles back to the opened position. I had to manually pry the handles apart to separate the blades for the next cut.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as described, but a little unwieldy. The first and only time I used it to clip my toe nails I had to figure out the right angle so I didn&#x27;t clip my toe... especially the big ones! But that is likely my fault and not a fault with the product.</li>
    <li> Great pair of toenail cutters to &#x27;get in there&#x27;. I love them</li>
    <li> Not sharp at all.  If you run your finger along the blade it doesn&#x27;t feel as if it&#x27;s made to cut anything.  It requires considerable force to clip my toenails.  Also, I question whether it&#x27;s really stainless steel.  I can&#x27;t find a marking of any kind on it.  Not worth the bother of returning, but I&#x27;ll probably look for another clippers.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as expected and works better than the folded clippers.</li>
    <li> A very well made tool for a good price.</li>
    <li> not sharp . will not cut toe nails</li>
    <li> Finally a tool that will attack my big toe nails.  Much more control than conventional toenail clippers.  Well built and very sharp.</li>
    <li> I never had better pair of cutters. These cut perfectly. I&#x27;ll never need another pair. They are heavy-duty and very well built.</li>
    <li> Was not sharp, wasn&#x27;t cutting nails was crushing them,with the handles closed you can look at the cutting surface and see daylight.</li>
    <li> work well after i had to file and refit the locking device, and get it working properly.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace same clippers that were my gramp&#x27;s....he was born 1909...but, no, silly, our old ones weren&#x27;t that old....but many a thick toenail they had trimmed.  Searched around --  read reviews...would have paid mych more if necessary....these are of the same quality as our old pair.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> These are large, heavy duty trimmers. I&#x27;d hoped to be able to use these to handle ingrown toenails, but the pointed end is way too big to fit under the edge of my nail (and I don&#x27;t have tiny nails - I&#x27;m a big guy). So if you only need to chop bits off of tough or thickened toenails, these will work (if you buff the edge afterwards - the cut is somewhat ragged). But for ingrown toenails, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I am 61 years old and of course, my toenails are a bit tougher than they were twenty years ago. I do not have any problems with my nails, but I find it more difficult to clip them with lighter tools. I ordered these because they have the best spring mechanism and have that great lock-bar at the bottom. They are sharp, efficient, easy to clip straight across my nails and are the most sturdy and well-made clippers I have ever owned. I am more than pleased, especially since they were so easy to obtain through AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I really thought this would handle a problem with tough toenails, but that isn&#x27;t the case.  Even with soaked toenails, the clippers have a hard time cutting them - it&#x27;s more like it clamps down and you have to wiggle it back and forth, then it kind of tears off the nail.  This results in a ragged and uneven cut that then requires a lot of filing to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers just don&#x27;t seem sharp.  It&#x27;s very much like a dull wire-cutting tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep looking for a solution to my problem, because this isn&#x27;t it.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical before my purchase after reading a few ‘not so 5 star’ comments.  But thank God I listened to my first mind and made the purchase.  I LOVE it.  It works exactly as I hoped and as described. As a person with self-diagnosed “worst feet and hardest toenails in the world” I needed something that would really ‘cut the mustard’ if you know what I mean and it does just that.</li>
    <li> Great product for price!</li>
    <li> What can I say about toenail clippers?  They work great</li>
    <li> Worthless, You need the strength of superman to actually clip a nail. It is either super dull or I just received a clipper that didn&#x27;t get sharpened</li>
    <li> They work fine but I wish they were a little larger, I have big hands and it makes it hard to hold these</li>
    <li> The blades meet along the whole length and work well on fairly thick toenails. The latch is little difficult but works, the plastic sleeve is handy</li>
    <li> My brother has some thick toenails so this was ordered for him.  Works great and very heavy duty.</li>
    <li> Nicely made, blades reasonably sharp, certainly sharper than the wire-cutting pliers that this resembles.&lt;br /&gt;I have to watch out for the points. Nice that it was made with a storage lock at end of handle.&lt;br /&gt;Worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an almost identical revlon clipper before and it was excellent.  This one, however, is dull and is almost impossible to re-clip shut.  Maybe this is just the odd-ball.. and I got un-lucky, but these clippers are a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before choosing this item. The person for whom my husband &amp; I purchased this thinks it is the best clipper/cutter he has ever used. He had a foot injury years ago. When one of his toenails grew back, it was very hard &amp; thick, pretty much impossible to trim properly, until now! We hope that it works as well for others.</li>
    <li> These clippers work fairly well with thicker toenails.  I am fairly happy with them and they seem to do the job… The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is that they could be a tad sharper.  I do recommend them, however.</li>
    <li> I like these clippers because the are heavy duty, and can do a good job on my tough toe nails. The spring really help because it reopen the snips for you rather than reposition you r grip to open them. Hard to beat for the money.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and from what I was told they were heavy duty and worked perfect . Would recommend these to anyone in need of a nail clipper for thick toenails.</li>
    <li> The clipper was not as sharp as expected. Had some difficulty clipping the toe nails. Am somewhat disappointed .with the product.</li>
    <li> Well made and very reasonably priced. Glad I ordered them.</li>
    <li> Love this tool. Excellent quality</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as I would like but still a good deal for the price</li>
    <li> Good quality steel will for see that it will hold up for service as intended.  Works well with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have owned cutters of the same design that cost plenty more and those ones were not as good as these.</li>
    <li> Did not cut nails easily (not sharp enough).  Also release at bottom very difficult to open and shut.  Some quality control might help.</li>

    <li> works alright. The Price was right</li>
    <li> I have some thick toenails and most other clippers do not open wide enough to cut them.  I bought these but they open wide enough, but do not have enough leverage to cut.  If the pivot point were moved a centimeter closer to the blade, they might work.  If the handles were two inches longer they might work.  However as is they do not cut.</li>
    <li> Great! Came in a timely manner. Works fine</li>
    <li> Cuts heavy duty toe nails with ease</li>
    <li> At first I had doubts about its claim  for power but it is great.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my mom who is elderly.  She was not happy going to a podiatrist just to get her nails trimmed.  Now I trim them quickly for her.  Not super sharp, but do the job.  They make cutting tough thick nails easier. I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality clipper.  I needed to replace a 35 year old set and this is every bit as good as this older unit.  Solid, sharp, easy to hold.</li>
    <li> They are very large, the size of pliers and they do not spring back, you have to open them again manually. They are literally like using a larger pair of diagonal cutting pliers.</li>
    <li> Cuts gnarly fungus-infested toenails like nothing else.  (Sorry, but that&#x27;s what I bought it for.)</li>
    <li> bought this for my mom who has some thickening of her toe nails.  worked very well and easy to handle for older people too.</li>
    <li> This tool is made like a professional tool.  The spring mechanism makes it far better for cutting heavy toenails than others we have tried.  Very good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Item is solid and stainless and cuts average toenails but not the thicker and tougher ones, like my nails that have fungus. I squeeze it real hard and nothing happens.  I would not have bought it had I known.</li>
    <li> The jaws of the clipper do not close perfectly, as indicated by other reviewers.  One can see a tiny gap in between.&lt;br /&gt;And hence often it does not cut OFF the nail easily.  If the nail is really thick, the tip of the cutter does not have enough lever force like the traditional nail cutter to break it.  But the part closer to the hinge will have stronger forces.&lt;br /&gt;When I need to do the toe nail job, I often soak the feet in warm or hot water for 20 minutes for the foot massage and blood circulation.  By then the nails are soft and easy to be nipped off by this cutter.</li>
    <li> This item works as expected.  Years ago my family had one similar to this one, smaller though and thus easier to slip under the side of a nail that is trying to become in-grown.  At some point a family member tried to use the thing to cut wire and ruined it.  I have had to use a razor sharp knife ever since though now my eyes require glasses and that makes it not so easy.&lt;br /&gt;  Now I have grown sons and recently had to cut out an in-grown with my knife without being able to feel what I was doing which really worried me.  Got the job done though without making things worse.  However the task and my personal limitations got me thinking and so it occurred to me to get something they could use to help prevent this situation from reoccurring.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty, and serve their purpose.  It&#x27;s hard to use the locking mechanism on the bottom, though...</li>
    <li> Ends do not cut without extreme pressure, much more than what I want to exert.</li>
    <li> Badly designed.  Almost impossible to secure clippers in closed position.</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite toenail clippers. I have had problems through the years with my toenails - from ingrown to thickness (that comes with age). These clippers are so helpful. They have the power to cut through some pretty thick nails. And the spring mechanism allows for easy of use for almost any hand. I also enjoy the locking mechanism for when you put them away - so they don&#x27;t simple sit sprung open. I absolutely recommend these.</li>
    <li> Made solidly out of metal. However has many razor sharp edges around the hinge area. Had to get a file and grind off the edges or it would actually be dangerous to use.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made,don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> If these are the same clippers I&#x27;ve had in the past they are excellent.  I misplaced the pair I&#x27;ve had for many years, so was happy to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;NOW THE REST OF THE STORY.  I received a completely different pair of clippers without the thick metal spring near the blades and with NO lock guard!  AND I HAVE TO PAY for return shipping!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has been said about replacing the clippers with the right ones.  AVOID THE HASSLE AND ADDITIONAL EXPENSE!  Find them somewhere else.</li>
    <li> It does a professional job... what more can you say!</li>
    <li> The spring action is barely there. The spring actually came off on first use. I hope they loosen up with time. The action seems to tight and I was hoping the grips would be a little longer, as in &#x27;mansized&#x27; it seems as if they make these things for smallish hands. The only good point is they&#x27;re sharp and did cut my toenail fungus ok. So in summary -sharp but uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Strong,easy gripping cutters.</li>
    <li> These clippers are just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; to me. They are sharp enough to cut, but the overall quality isn&#x27;t great. The spring is very cheap and it doesn&#x27;t have a nice feel when squeezed. You get what you pay for though. I wish I had dropped a little more cash for a name brand. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Not sharp at all. Awkward to handle.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product yet but it looks like it will take care of my thick toenails.</li>
    <li> Seem to do the job very fair price thanks</li>
    <li> Works great, super sharp and makes cutting my toenails quick and easy</li>
    <li> these were just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Heavy sturdy product, thank you.</li>
    <li> NOT VERY EASY TO USE  COMPARED TO OTHER CLIPPERS, DOES NOT CUT AS EASILY ADEQUATE FO SMALL OR EASILY CUT NAIL  TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF STRENGTH IN HANDS TO CUT THICKER NAILS</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get too worked up over a pair of toe nail clippers.  They do work well and seem to be constructed well.  It is a little difficult to unlock the little latch that keeps them closed when not in use.</li>
    <li> I use these to cut hard coral for my reef tank...great quality. Also, tried it on my toenails, and worked great! Fired toenail clippings all over my house!</li>
    <li> At the time of this writing, these were around $6. I expected them to be sort of crappy for that price, so I set expectations low. At the same time I ordered a $50 pair of ones I expected to be nice (nice one for me, cheap for my kid). Sadly, the $50 pair is not nearly as nice as these. For $6, these are worth every penny. They are not top of the line, but they get the job done well, and don&#x27;t cost much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that the picture here makes them appear a bit nicer than they actually are. The photo does seem to be for the right model, but the picture seems to have been doctored to make them look a bit less rough around the edges - cleaner lines, no machining marks, etc. So aesthetically what you&#x27;ll get is not quite so perfect looking, but close. But they work great, no complaints at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny, and avoid the $50 units!</li>
    <li> Finally, a pair of snips I can actually hold and exert force with - great trimmers.</li>
    <li> This clipper is very hard to work and it doesn&#x27;t lock properly;  as always, you get what you pay for -- I sent mine back.</li>
    <li> Works great, just as I had hoped!</li>
    <li> Blades are not sharp enough to clip nails cleanly.</li>
    <li> work as advertised, and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly but they don&#x27;t have much ability to clip harder nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these clippers a few times now and am convinced that they are just not as good as the Revlon ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The blades on these clippers do not seem as sharp and require repositioning to make an effective cut. Sometimes, I have to struggle to get the clippers to cut through the nail.  I do not have thickened nails or anything abnormal, but these clippers just don&#x27;t cut as well as my old Revlon pair.  I even got my old pair out of the drawer and confirmed that they are easier to cut with than this pair.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> For the price they are okay. Hard to latch closed.</li>
    <li> Great quality product!!</li>
    <li> not bad for a safety pair for camping trips but overall low quality you get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;they almost work on my tough-as-nails toe nails they leave a rough edge and do not always cut completely along the cutting edge</li>
    <li> This pair is 1/4 of the price I paid for my Italy-made clippers.  Sounds great, right?  But it&#x27;s not even 1/4 useful.  In fact, it&#x27;s useLESS.  It&#x27;s poorly made and feels rough in my hand.  But I can&#x27;t be picky about that.  The thing is, it doesn&#x27;t make a clean cut for thinner nails.  For thicker ones, it doesn&#x27;t cut at all!</li>
    <li> Big, strong, dull, and very hard to sharpen.</li>
    <li> They do the job and are reasonable priced.</li>
    <li> Works great on both thin fingernails as well as the thicker toenails (and occasionaly, I&#x27;ve used it for my pet&#x27;s claws when I couldn&#x27;t find the claw trimmer)</li>
    <li> Great for people who have THICK toenails, Yikes!</li>
    <li> These are heavy duty clippers.  They do cut through a thick nail.  You will need to have some strength in hand to operate these.&lt;br /&gt;The quality was better than expected for such a low price.</li>
    <li> These are great for toenails.  I like the way they have eliminated the little spring in the middle which has in the past cut my fingers as I tried to clip my nails.</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> They won&#x27;t even cut my toenails!  I thought they&#x27;d be pretty powerful, since they work like dikes.  They aren&#x27;t worth a darn.  They won&#x27;t even cut my toenails.  Junk.</li>
    <li> The power toe nail clippers provide great value.  They do not operate as smoothly or easily as the expensive models I have had.  However, this is not a detraction, just an observation. They do the job at a bargain price.</li>
    <li> Good and specially when  you consider the reasonable price for it shipped</li>
    <li> works good at a good price</li>
    <li> I was not able to get this to work on my tough nails, but feel it is OK.  Seems well-made and strong.</li>
    <li> Neither as powerful or sharp as I would like. Lacks sufficient mechanical advantage. From an old man with thick, diabetic nails.</li>
    <li> THESE CLIPPERS WORK GREAT  AS DESCRIBED  EASY TO HOLD  I HAVE VERY THICK NAILS AND THESE WORK EASILY AND DO THE JOB</li>
    <li> This item came on tie no problem they work very well nice and sharp they do a great job I would buy this item again</li>
    <li> I perform foot clinics and use several pairs of these. They work great and are very durable for 2 cm thick nails</li>
    <li> vary well made thank you</li>
    <li> Giant, bulky, heavy...</li>
    <li> I had an older pair but misplace it bought the new pair  month ago and today I found the old one..  The new pair doesn&#x27;t seem to be as well made BUT they&#x27;re sharper ...</li>
    <li> Does not do as good a job as expected for thick toe nails.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, makes difficult to cut nails not so difficult. Delivery was fast and Customer Service is good. Would recommend</li>
    <li> excellent product,price does not reflect quality,this is a tool very well finished,the size is large as I needed for my arthritic hands and now can do the job with a satisfactory  grip.</li>
    <li> DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; 5 1/2&amp;#34; x 1 3/4&amp;#34; X 1/2&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Sharp, curved blade, 3/4&amp;#34; long&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Locks closed&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Spring holds open when not locked closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVALUATION&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Good design&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Fits well in the hand&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Operates and cuts well, even very thick, hard nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Your nails will cut easier, with less likelihood of cracking, immediately after a shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; If you cannot arrange to cut your nails after a bath, then soak them in hand-lotion for 5 minutes first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN-GROWN TOENAILS&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The sharp thin blade can be used to relieve pressure from ingrown toenails, but doing to will inevitably cause bleeding and the toe will become very painfully infected.  So, if you perform ingrown toenail &amp;#34;surgery&amp;#34;, immediately smoother the area in antibiotic cream and cover with a thick bandage.  Change the antibiotic cream and bandage several times per day for several days. As a long term solution, file down the center of your toenail thin with nail-file, to will allow the toenail to &amp;#34;shrink&amp;#34; laterally---but that&#x27;s over a period of months.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; To minimize irritation to ingrown toenails:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Keep the toenails short, with only a slight curve.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; If you wear men&#x27;s-type socks, wear them inside-out to minimize rubbing of the seam against your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAVEATS&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Fit and finish less that perfect--but that is only a cosmetic issue.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Operation slightly &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; which is easily fixed with a little silicon grease [[ASIN:B002KR5YN4 Permatex PERMATEX DIELECTRIC GREASE 22058]].

    <li> Not as sharp as one would hope for. The storage clamp is hard to open and close. I&#x27;ll purchase better quality next time.</li>
    <li> Very good and affordable nail clippers. Large enough to do the job properly, others I have ordered just did not have the leverage to cut properly.</li>
    <li> I bought these because my mom has very thick toenails and regular clippers won&#x27;t work wish me luck and thank you for such a great prouduct</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t clip, they don&#x27;t cut, if you really use a lot of force they may nibble. Pay more and get the chrome plated jobs, maybe even a made in America brand.</li>
    <li> An excellent  value for the money.  Wish I had found these decades  ago.</li>
    <li> Gap in cutter blades and latch would not close</li>
    <li> I have a large toe with a stubborn fungus on it that has only made the nail a heckuva lot thicker.  A normal toe nail clipper will not cut this nail.  One day I was frustrated, I went out into the garage and tried different wire cutters to see if they would work.  They weren&#x27;t sharp enough and I thought it was a ridiculous way to cut the nail.  I found and ordered the Power Toe Nail Cutters, and when they arrived, I attacked that nasty as hell big toe nail.  Clip, clip, clip, and it was trimmed.  No muss, no fuss, no bother.  Five stars means you love them.  I don&#x27;t love them, I mean, how can you love toenail clippers?  Am I right?  But they deserve five starts because they do the job they were intended to do, and that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> I received the clippers sooner than expected. They work well, but could be a little sharper.  If you have hard nails I would suggest that you soak your feet first to soften nails.  Good Buy..</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work as well as my old ones - I had lost them, which is why I ordered these. I since found them, and they&#x27;re much better. These that I purchased from Amazon have blades that are too straight and too thick.</li>
    <li> 4 star rating because the blade part is a bit thick and it&#x27;s harder to get a close cut with them.  Other than that they are great and solid.  You do need the grip of a martial arts fighter to get them open though.</li>
    <li> Great product but different to the clipper in the pic</li>
    <li> Very heavy duty!  Just what I needed for super thick toenails.</li>
    <li> Does the job that I have been paying to have done.</li>
    <li> Great price. Seems well made.  But ...  once opened, you can&#x27;t close the clasp again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse, at least for me, the blade did not cut through my toe nails any better that a Dollar Store clipper i&#x27;ve used for years. Perhaps you will have better luck?</li>
    <li> The clippers don&#x27;t cut; cutting edge is dull!  Not worth the money!!</li>
    <li> HEAVY, HARD TO HANDLE</li>
</ol>
