      <li>This is an amazing sandalwood oil blend.  </li>
      <li>love the smell, really good quality.</li>
      <li>Not quite as warm a Smell as I would like.</li>
      <li>I added Hawaiin to the blend and real album making it perfect.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s kind of</li>
      <li>Yeah, it was kind of like</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very rich and has a nice aroma.</li>
      <li>Very light scent....</li>
      <li>It is more &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; than sweet - &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; like the smell of the ground in Mysore, India after a good monsoon rain.</li>
      <li>Love this oil.</li>
      <li>I think you will love this.</li>
      <li>If you love sandalwood</li>
      <li>Women seem to love it too.</li>
      <li>It makes it nice and smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>and it would be ok,</li>
      <li>This is the authentic Sandalwood.</li>
      <li>I diffuse this oil at night to help boost my production of melatonin and to help me achieve a deeper and more restful night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
      <li>I am going through menopause and, like many women, have difficulty falling asleep and have begun experiencing sleep disturbances during the night.  </li>
      <li>I wish I could smell it more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sleeping better and more soundly than I have in months.</li>
      <li>The sandalwood was amazing when diffused -  very pure aromatic qualities.</li>
      <li>and I was super pleased and super excited!!</li>
      <li>I did not expect this to smell so strongly of sandalwood.</li>
      <li>So strong and the notes are divine.</li>
      <li>If the two oils of yours that I have tried so far are a good representation of the quality of the rest of your oils, I would be glad to continue purchasing from your company.</li>
      <li>I do recommend anyone looking to buy sandalwood 100% pure that you try this, you will LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Still working my way through a huge gift set of oils and keep returning to this one.</li>
      <li>And, I&#x27;m not talking about the cheap brands.</li>
      <li>Warm, woody and very sensuous.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice Sandalwood essential oil!</li>
      <li>The aroma of this oil is lovely, and is very gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>As long as the purity is great</li>
      <li>So far I love the smell of it through the diffuser, so relaxing!</li>
      <li>First Impressions: strong, rich, and long-lasting fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am super</li>
      <li>I expected something a little sweeter,but I have many uses for this oil,and it will work wonderfully</li>
      <li>I used this product for diffusion/aromatherapy purposes, to calm my thinking.  </li>
      <li>This bottle was fresh.</li>
      <li>Sandalwood has to be fresh otherwise</li>
      <li>I love the smell of sandalwood, but this particular one is very musky.  </li>
      <li>i simply cannot wait to try some other fragrances! :D</li>
      <li>So, I now get unscented creams from them and add the oil into it to make a fresh Sandalwood Shaving Cream, and the real scent is far and away better than the synthetic garbage they put in theirs.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for the smell of it very much; it&#x27;s not what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Love this oil, I use it for cosmetics applications and especially in my hair products.</li>
      <li>Diffusing Sandalwood has really made a difference!  </li>
      <li>When I first opened the bottle and smelled, it was just almost intoxicating.</li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s totally worth it and lasts much longer than you&#x27;d think (if you use it the way I do).</li>
      <li>I have purchased essential oils from many suppliers around the world.</li>
      <li>I have been using essential oils for about 2.5 years and now use them even more for my oils application  technique massage.</li>
      <li>I can not wait to integrate more oils from this company into my daily routine!!</li>
      <li>First I must say, I truly love all of the deSensua oils (my husband jokingly refers to me a the witch doctor bc of my extensive collection).</li>
      <li>have used this oil for two days straight on the same diffuser pad in diffuser necklace and have not had to add more oil....</li>
      <li>i have to say this oil first of all is VERY HIGH GRADE</li>
      <li>Most things that are not natural or &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; smell &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; to me and will often lead to headaches and nausea in all but the smallest quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Our new favorite shop to purchase truly pure essential</li>
      <li>This sandalwood oil is deeply fragranced, luxuriously smooth &amp; incredibly high grade!</li>
      <li>Very concentrated as adding just a drop or two to the diffuser scents the whole bedroom for hours.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells like sandalwood mixed with something else. Not quite as warm a Smell as I would like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve added to my oil diffuser at night time for sleep.&lt;br /&gt;- I have applied it topically, neat (straight) to my wrists, thighs and stomach to help with libido (I&#x27;ve also applied it with my mixture of jojoba, orange and ylang ylang III oils for libido).&lt;br /&gt;- I have used it just to inhale as it smells so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;- I also use sandalwood in a custom oil blend that I made for my daughter, and use on her every single night. I&#x27;m nearly out of my prior sandalwood oil for the blend and I&#x27;ll be making her next bedtime oil with the De Sensua sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells rich and wonderful. I have sandalwood from another supplier and it&#x27;s nearly scent-less and a much smaller amount. The aroma of this oil is lovely, and is very gentle on my skin. My husband actually likes the smell of it and likes the smell of the other things I&#x27;ve mixed with it so far (small amount of jasmine, orange and ylang ylang).</li>
    <li> Love the smell!  I use it in my diffuser and in essential carrier oils.  Relaxing.</li>
    <li> I have never owned Sandalwood oil. I have not been able to afford it through the MLM company I distribute for (don&#x27;t tell!!!!!). I have read that Sandalwood is amazing for calming anxieties, heightening happiness and empowering the spirit. Let me tell you - deSensua Sandalwood oil did not disappoint! In fact I was 100% blown away and speechless!!! I simply took the bottle straight to my husband and said &amp;#34;SMELL THIS!!!!!&amp;#34; We were both stunned! I&#x27;ve put this oil on my diffuser necklace pad along with your Frankincense oil and I am one HAPPY MOMMA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this oil for two days straight on the same diffuser pad in diffuser necklace and have not had to add more oil.... The smell has remained the same from the very moment I put it on the cotton pad for over two days now! I diffused the Sandalwood oil, along with deSensua Frankincense oil, for bed two nights ago.... Let me tell you that the scent was calming and relaxing. I am so happy I have this oil now!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing sandalwood oil blend.  It smells heavenly.  There can be a lot of hits and misses with ordering sandalwood from different companies. This seems to be high quality, affordable compared to others- and a great price for the 15ml size.  It is leaning on the masculine side so I add a drop of vanilla with it to soften it up and it smells Divine!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent santalum blend. I added Hawaiin to the blend and real album making it perfect. This is one I&#x27;ll purchase again. As good as doterra, edensgarden &amp; edenbotanicals. Keep up the quality and I&#x27;ll keep returning! Great for skin spritzing and after shower body sprays. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know pure from fake but all I can say it smells strong, so that must be pure... right?</li>
    <li> First Impressions: strong, rich, and long-lasting fragrance. Less than a drop will linger for days. It is more &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; than sweet - &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; like the smell of the ground in Mysore, India after a good monsoon rain. There is this gorgeous earthy perfume in the air - smells like that. Good product.</li>
    <li> First I must say, I truly love all of the deSensua oils (my husband jokingly refers to me a the witch doctor bc of my extensive collection). I have recently received this bottle of 100% pure sandalwood as a gift from a fellow essential oil hobbyist. This sandalwood oil is deeply fragranced, luxuriously smooth &amp; incredibly high grade! I have always loved the smell of sandalwood oil, but was unsure that I could find a use for it. After receiving this oil &amp; doing a little bit of research, not only do I have a beautifully scented perfume, but I have started dabbing a touch of it on my scars (especially on the face, left over from acne) &amp; I have read that it will help clear stretch marks too. Double bonus!</li>
    <li> I purchased your Sandalwood essential oil on Amazon after an extensive search for the highest quality oil I could find.  I didn&#x27;t want a diluted product.  I diffuse this oil at night to help boost my production of melatonin and to help me achieve a deeper and more restful night&#x27;s sleep.  I am going through menopause and, like many women, have difficulty falling asleep and have begun experiencing sleep disturbances during the night.  Diffusing Sandalwood has really made a difference!  I&#x27;m sleeping better and more soundly than I have in months.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice Sandalwood essential oil! It&#x27;s very rich and has a nice aroma. It gives the skin a healthy glow!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review with the fact that I have a highly sensitive nose.  I usually detect developing smells in the environment minutes before anyone else in the room is able to.  It&#x27;s more of a curse than a blessing, because as a result, I can only deal with a small set of relatively pure (and unfortunately expensive) fragrances in my life.  Most things that are not natural or &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; smell &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; to me and will often lead to headaches and nausea in all but the smallest quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the glowing reviews, I decided to pony up the $50+ for this oil.  I diffused it using a fairly high end, cold air atomizer.  No water or additional carrier substances or blending oils were used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various descriptions refer to this scent as &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;sensual&amp;#34;.  I found it to be neither of those.  To me it was pungent and even, to my nose, rancid.  It literally felt like it was stinging my nostrils and then punching me in the frontal lobe of my brain.  Needless to say, it was unusable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it changed composition due to traveling in the mail during the summer or if it&#x27;s just this bad off of the production line.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried from this manufacturer, so it&#x27;s hard for me to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After recovering from the initial assault to my senses, I attempted to blend minute quantities of this product with various light floral oils.  It just got worse and worse. You know that smell when you mix fruity room sprays with some unholy bathroom or kitchen odor?  Yeah, it was kind of like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to return this one and can&#x27;t currently recommend it.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll try another bottle in the Winter.  Then again, maybe not.</li>
    <li> WOW! just a perfect product. So strong and the notes are divine. We ordered again immediately from the company because their oil has integrity, and found the same result with every single one we ordered. Our new favorite shop to purchase truly pure essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: with our first purchase we got a gift in the package - a coupon for a discount for our next order which we promptly used after smelling the sandalwood oil we purchased. That is a difficult one to find without carrier oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a perfect experience from beginning to end. Great shop.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. ..hope you have  a couple of  my other two favorite oils</li>
    <li> This is a very nice Sandalwood.  It has a strong and long lasting scent. I have blended it with Frankincense for a sore throat and it worked.  I&#x27;ve used it to scent my hand lotion and it smells heavenly. I would recommend this oil to everyone interested in essential oils and I just ordered another bottle.  Love this oil.</li>
    <li> The scent does linger and when I get up in the morning and put on yesterday&#x27;s hoodie the Sandlewood smell makes me feel good about the day.</li>
    <li> I used this product for diffusion/aromatherapy purposes, to calm my thinking.  Absolutely amazing.  I bought this after searching far and wide for a resonably priced sandalwood, without sacrificing quality.  The smell alone is pretty close to Mysore Sandalwood, at least to my nose.  A little more musky but without a doubt very very familar.  The effects are great.  Grounding, calming, everything Sandalwood&#x27;s said to do.</li>
    <li> First of all  I am a full time user of essential oils and I do NOT consider myself limited to just one &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; of oil.  As long as the purity is great and I am receiving the BEST benefit from the oil I am super happy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this essential oil (Sandalwood)  as a gift from a friend and I was super pleased and super excited!! I have been using essential oils for about 2.5 years and now use them even more for my oils application  technique massage. I can not wait to integrate more oils from this company into my daily routine!! The sandalwood was amazing when diffused -  very pure aromatic qualities. I also used it for it calming properties and emotional balance and well being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to see that it came in a brown tinted bottle and the label was very appealing to the eye. It was easy to read and very happy to see ingredients listed.  Will definitely purchase from this company in the future!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied and would recommend to anyone whether you are old or new to the essential oil world!!</li>
    <li> Still working my way through a huge gift set of oils and keep returning to this one. I have some expensive sandalwood cologne and shaving soap (the classic type you use with a brush) and a single drop of this pure oil on my jacket keeps that sandalwood vibe going all day! Works out much, much cheaper than the English cologne!</li>
    <li> Smells earthy and beautiful. Scent lasts a lot longer than Aura Cacia we had before.</li>
    <li> Why should a BLEND of sandalwood be so expensive? This is probably a 5% solution of sandalwood and 95% jojoba oil, which is about about $8.00 per quart. This price is the going price for a full ounce of Australian sandalwood. Normally a blended oil of this size is about $15.00. This makes no sense.</li>
    <li> Love the scent! Women seem to love it too.</li>
    <li> Holy cow!  When I first opened the bottle and smelled, it was just almost intoxicating. What a wonderful, warm, woody odor. I did not expect this to smell so strongly of sandalwood. If you love sandalwood I think you will love this. It was expensive but will probably last me years as I will use it as a body scent. It is so concentrated that I have to use less than a drop. I will need to dilute it some with a carrier oil. I&#x27;ve been a die hard patchouli girl for years. I&#x27;m either switching or going to come up with a blend of both.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, I use it for cosmetics applications and especially in my hair products. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> DeSensua was kind enough to send me a bottle of their Sandalwood Oil a few months back. I am a devoted wet shaver, and finding actual Sandalwood oil or extract in a shaving cream is almost impossible. And, I&#x27;m not talking about the cheap brands. I&#x27;ve had AOS, Geo F. Trumpers, TOBS and so on. They all have &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; listed as their ingredient instead of the oil - I guess due to the price. But, Castle Forbes, Geo F., Art of Shaving and Taylor of Bond Street all charge enough money to put &amp;#34;enough&amp;#34; drops of real sandalwood oil in them. None do. So, I now get unscented creams from them and add the oil into it to make a fresh Sandalwood Shaving Cream, and the real scent is far and away better than the synthetic garbage they put in theirs. But, their base cream are still better than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have yet to find a pre-shave or aftershave that has real sandalwood in them. If someone knows of any, please let me know. It would take too much of this oil to make a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; pre-shave or post-shave product. Nothing beats, though, when I start to lather my cream and drop 5 or so droplets into each shave. The smell is invigorating and intoxicating. For now, that&#x27;ll have to do. I really wish the old English shaving companies would be loyal to their customers and put real oil into it. Oh, and &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; has so many unknown harsh chemicals that can cause reactions. Believe me, there wouldn&#x27;t have to be &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; shaving cream lines if they&#x27;d only use the real oil. And, I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While DeSensua uses a blend of sandalwood oils from Africa to Australia to India, it says it&#x27;s steam distilled so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re just mixing the oils randomly. Is it pricey? Yep. But, it&#x27;s totally worth it and lasts much longer than you&#x27;d think (if you use it the way I do).</li>
    <li> Mixed feelings.  I love the smell of sandalwood, but this particular one is very musky.  I thought I could dilute it a lot and it would be ok, but I just couldn&#x27;t take it.  It was pretty expensive, so I asked if I could return it for a refund and the seller gracefully obliged.  So, not so good a review on the product, but a great review on the seller.</li>
    <li> Wonderful rich and sensuous fragrance that my husband and I both love. Very concentrated as adding just a drop or two to the diffuser scents the whole bedroom for hours. This is the best smelling Sandalwood I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with all my purchases of DeSenua oils and will continue to be a customer.</li>
    <li> love the smell, really good quality.</li>
    <li> I use it for as a deodorant, on my face as part of my daily facial care, in my hair to help with dry ends, as a fragrance. I get many positive responses to the fragrance, I love it as facial care and there is no better deodorant. I am a retired massage therapist and have used essential oils for many years, both in therapy as well as in my personal life.  I have purchased essential oils from many suppliers around the world. If the two oils of yours that I have tried so far are a good representation of the quality of the rest of your oils, I would be glad to continue purchasing from your company.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;5-Star Rating – I love the oil what a beautiful blend. Five Star Seller. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Smells good but haven&#x27;t seen any benefit from it yet</li>
    <li> i have to say this oil first of all is VERY HIGH GRADE &amp; i have always wanted to buy some Premium Sandalwood Oil but the prices can be outrageous.  I do recommend anyone looking to buy sandalwood 100% pure that you try this, you will LOVE IT! i simply cannot wait to try some other fragrances! :D i will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of Sandalwood, you will like this.  (I don&#x27;t like the smell of sandalwood)</li>
    <li> Currently I&#x27;m using it in my diffuser and plan on making a facial cleanser with it. So far I love the smell of it through the diffuser, so relaxing!</li>
    <li> Sandalwood is REALLY hard to get.  This is VERY good for the price.  It is a blend but since pure Indian Sandalwood is almost impossible to get, DeSensua is the best I have found.  I will buy this again when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> My gf is black and uses it with raw Shea butter and a few other things to make an all natural hair cream for her 4c hair.  It makes it nice and smooth and silky.  She has some very beautiful hair!  Nothing like all natural!</li>
    <li> Happy with quality of product and quality of customer service.  No problems and delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> After wasting money on other brands of supposedly Sandalwood, I decided to spend the extra money. This is the authentic Sandalwood. Warm, woody and very sensuous. Sandalwood has to be fresh otherwise it has an awful off smell. This bottle was fresh. I highly recommend it. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I expected something a little sweeter,but I have many uses for this oil,and it will work wonderfully</li>
    <li> Very light scent.... Too light act actually. I wish I could smell it more.</li>
    <li> Expensive but nice...</li>
    <li> My previous experience with sandalwood is art of shaving sandalwood cream, and mama bear sandalwood shaving soap. I like the smell of those, so thought I would try some real sandalwood oil in my homemade shaving balm. This oil does not smell like those scents. This oil has been described as woody and dense by others... I would say it smells like freshcut trees, like you just cut a fir tree and a pine tree, like their sap... you put it on and it&#x27;s kind of like you washed your clothes in pinesol. I don&#x27;t care for the smell of it very much; it&#x27;s not what I was expecting. Maybe others really like it, but I don&#x27;t care for it too much. Don&#x27;t want to smell like a christmas tree.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have used ALL kinds of Sandalwood. Never thought of actually mixing them. This is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great product! I will be purchasing it again. It arrived promptly, and the scent was exactly what I expected.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍</li>
