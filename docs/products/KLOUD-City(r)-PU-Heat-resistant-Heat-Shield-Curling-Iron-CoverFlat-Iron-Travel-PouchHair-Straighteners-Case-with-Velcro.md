      <li>This is a great item.!</li>
      <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
      <li>My curling iron fits perfectly (it would hold two) and I feel safe packing it away after use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice pouch</li>
      <li>Great for travel when you can&#x27;t wait for the iron to cool before packing it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Nice if you have to store a hot iron in a hurry though.</li>
      <li>This case will be fine for protecting my appliances while traveling.</li>
      <li>just fine.</li>
      <li>I bought two and these fit</li>
      <li>It goes right in her gym bag with the iron still hot and no damage!!</li>
      <li>Definitely an economical purchase.</li>
      <li>This works exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Can put it away hot without worry.</li>
      <li>Of course, the inside of the bag is heat resistant so you can put a hot iron into the bag.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t put a hot curing iron in it however.  </li>
      <li>Also, a large silver-gray microfiber cleaning cloth came with the pouch.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I need to put my hot curling iron away each morning and this makes sure I don&#x27;t burn down the house.</li>
      <li>They fit anything up to 15 inches long.</li>
      <li>The hot iron didn&#x27;t directly touch the case as it was propped up on its stand, but just the radiant heat scorched the bag.  </li>
      <li>I can now put my flat iron away when it&#x27;s hot</li>
      <li>This is an ok curling iron holder, but it&#x27;s a little too short for my 15.5&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I have a large flat iron with attachments and a curling iron.</li>
      <li>I bought this mainly to have a place to wrap the electric cord of my flat iron.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a nice pouch but it&#x27;s several inches too short for my regular sized curling irons and flat irons. If you have travel sized irons, this could work well.</li>
    <li> very happy with this purchase</li>

    <li> Bought it as a gift.  She loves it.  Great for travel when you can&#x27;t wait for the iron to cool before packing it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Item as described.</li>
    <li> This is a great item.! I can now put my flat iron away when it&#x27;s hot</li>
    <li> Received something similar but not as pictured. Certainly smaller than described. Not very pleased!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ve seen nicer ones since I got this that holds the cord also</li>
    <li> I have a large flat iron with attachments and a curling iron. I bought two and these fit just fine. I was a little worried that they would not be long enough. They fit anything up to 15 inches long. This case will be fine for protecting my appliances while traveling. Also, a large silver-gray microfiber cleaning cloth came with the pouch. Definitely an economical purchase.</li>
    <li> Great gifts and kept one for myself!</li>
    <li> Got this for a gift for a friend and she loves it.  It goes right in her gym bag with the iron still hot and no damage!!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Used to store curling iron when traveling.  Can put it away hot without worry.</li>
    <li> This is an ok curling iron holder, but it&#x27;s a little too short for my 15.5&amp;#34;  Beachwaver iron so I can&#x27;t close the flap.  (The bag is 14.5&amp;#34; long and 5.5&amp;#34; wide.)  Also, don&#x27;t rest the curling iron on the outside of the case.  Someone wrote that you could do that, and I set mine down on the outside.  The hot iron didn&#x27;t directly touch the case as it was propped up on its stand, but just the radiant heat scorched the bag.  Of course, the inside of the bag is heat resistant so you can put a hot iron into the bag.  I do like that it&#x27;s wide enough to hold the cord too.</li>
    <li> gift for my daughter who loves it!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly......exactly as described. Great product at a great price.</li>
