      <li>Another very nice product from Dove!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anything from Dove is great.</li>
      <li>Great soap.</li>
      <li>Those beads may feel great, but they don&#x27;t biodegrade, so they&#x27;ve started clogging up sewer systems in some places.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great in the summer, or any time of year.</li>
      <li>My husband found these at a great price and loves the body wash.</li>

      <li>I love this body wash!</li>
      <li>Liked it a lot.</li>
      <li>The product okay</li>
      <li>Great product, great scent and works as expected.  </li>
      <li>But do make sure the bottle says, \\&quot;NutrimMoisture\\&quot;, because not all Dove Body Washes have NutriMoisture in it.</li>
      <li>I really love this body wash.</li>
      <li>It also lacks the &amp;#34;scrubbing beads&amp;#34; that many products have.  </li>
      <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering but is still enjoyable.</li>
      <li>Amazing and smooth</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>nice cool feeling wash</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m picky when it comes to scents and how strong they are, but this one&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great shower gel or body wash, this not only smells great and feels luxurious, it really does leave your skin more hydrated after use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The sensitive skin formula may have changed a bit over time, but it&#x27;s been great</li>
      <li>I ordered it and received it very quickly.</li>
      <li>Scent aside, this wash leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy, and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to describe the scent, but it isn&#x27;t strong and it isn&#x27;t fruity.  </li>
      <li>the order was fine , thank you</li>
      <li>The scent is mild which, as a guy, I love.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a lovely, fresh smell, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>was happy that found same deal on amazon and bought it .Dove</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor - ditch the cheap soap and treat your skin with care.</li>
      <li>If the scent is important to you, I suggest opening a bottle of this in a grocery store or drugstore to smell it before buying it.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh clean smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave a risideu on my skin.</li>
      <li>My wife loves this body was, its cheap, a 3 pack will last her a while, and it smells good too.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a good product, and I buy this when I can&#x27;t go to Wal-Mart and get the generic version, which works just as well.</li>
      <li>Makes skin feel smooth and fresh.  </li>
      <li>This moisturizing body wash is so soothing to the skin, and gives you a refreshed and cool feeling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my third purchase of the 3 pack -- love it!</li>
      <li>and now I rotate in the go fresh formula to change things up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the fresh scent</li>
      <li>I was very pleased that this body wash is concentrated - I was able to use a relatively small amount.  </li>
      <li>I also love the subscribe and save feature - fast shipping and very conveniant.</li>
      <li>As a result, I wanted something more gentle than the bar soap I normally use in the shower.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sensitive, doesn&#x27;t dry skin out, great scent.</li>
      <li>The 17 year old said the bottle is easy to grasp while in the shower.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>My two teenage daughters, 17 and 13, both said they love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It is great for sensitive and dried skin type and will leave you soft and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Heartbroken, I decided to try this Dove Body Wash because I like Dove&#x27;s Campaign for Real Beauty.</li>
      <li>and it is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update : There is another package of same product for $13.98 but that includes two 24 OZ Dove and one free 9 OZ</li>
      <li>Not as pictured, I got Italian bottles, not like original US bottles.</li>
      <li>It is concentrated and a little goes a long way making this 3 pack a great deal.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy on my skin, doesn&#x27;t dry it out, and it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
      <li>One big issue I have with body washes is the concentration of the product - if it&#x27;s not concentrated it won&#x27;t last long, so what appears to be a good price isn&#x27;t really when you factor in how much of it you have to use each time you shower.  </li>
      <li>You might find yourself able to use less lotion or a lotion with a thinner</li>
      <li>Have used several different fragrances;  all are soothing and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Body Wash is a new line from Dove that contains NutrimMoisture, a hydrating mix of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;After water, ingredients Soybean Oil and Sunflower Oil are listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I went in search of new soap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been acne free for several years but for the last month or so that I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve had a ton of acne on my chest</li>
      <li>&#x27;s new line of body washes contain NutrimMoisture, a blend of oils and other hydrating ingredients that actually hydrate the top layer of your skin instead of just stripping all of the oils from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s completely budget-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>B000AO2NXS sensitive skin formula]]</li>
      <li>Go fresh is very, very similar, except that it has a minor cucumber scent.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend purchasing this, especially through Amazon.</li>
      <li>regular use, the large bottles should last months.</li>
      <li>out of the shower and dry, you&#x27;ll absolutely notice the difference in your skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as concentrated as the Fresh body washes, but it costs a lot less</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would absolutely recommend trying it before you buy any other brand.</li>
      <li>you apply it to your skin, initially it actually feels like lotion, but shortly after, bubbles begin, though not nearly as much as a typical shower</li>
      <li>For example, I tried the Korres fig shower gel because I liked the scent, but it was expensive and not highly concentrated.</li>
      <li>The fragrance does stick around for awhile, so you can decide if thats a good or bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used an expensive shower cleanser for years until it was phased out. Heartbroken, I decided to try this Dove Body Wash because I like Dove&#x27;s Campaign for Real Beauty. Well, this body wash is as wonderful as their campaign. It&#x27;s easy on my skin, doesn&#x27;t dry it out, and it&#x27;s affordable! I buy it in the 3 pack, and I use them to refill a pump bottle of the same body wash (not pictured here). I&#x27;m on my third purchase of the 3 pack -- love it!</li>
    <li> I really love this body wash. It&#x27;s sensitive, doesn&#x27;t dry skin out, great scent. Just a really good product. Dove makes the best body washes.</li>
    <li> great soap and value!</li>
    <li> Used every single day for years. Amazing and smooth</li>
    <li> I figured since my college had communal bathrooms, this would be easier than bringing a bar of soap. I&#x27;ve been acne free for several years but for the last month or so that I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve had a ton of acne on my chest/back. I do not recommend this!!!</li>

Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love dove body washes - but usually buy the store brand version becuase they are a bit expensive.  Not anymore!  This is a great price for this product!  I also love the subscribe and save feature - fast shipping and very conveniant.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing body wash is so soothing to the skin, and gives you a refreshed and cool feeling. It&#x27;s great in the summer, or any time of year. Another very nice product from Dove!</li>
    <li> Love the fresh clean smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave a risideu on my skin.</li>
    <li> My Family&#x27;s favorite scent ever!!!</li>
    <li> Package damage when received and it was a bit messy. The product okay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used bar soap for years. As happens the scent that I loved was discontinued so I went in search of new soap. I saw this package deal and figured I would give body wash a try. WOW! I love this stuff. It is concentrated and a little goes a long way making this 3 pack a great deal. The scent is mild which, as a guy, I love. I was a little worried with it being a Dove product that it would have a girly scent. I would definitely recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> THE BEST BODY WASH EVER</li>
    <li> Bought product after buying and trying out from store.  Great product, great scent and works as expected.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin and scent subtle and not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a good product, and I buy this when I can&#x27;t go to Wal-Mart and get the generic version, which works just as well.</li>
    <li> Just another one of those things I but online instead of at a grocery store or drug store.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Have used several different fragrances;  all are soothing and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured, I got Italian bottles, not like original US bottles. I Ordered Prime from Tee Green sellers. Won&#x27;t order from them again.</li>
    <li> not a good idea to purchase bath products from amazon.  these product seemed as if they had been sitting on a shelf somewhere for a decade.  I had to throw them away</li>
    <li> I like the fresh scent and it is very moisturizing. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, though, and both my husband and my son like it as well.</li>
    <li> I killed my memberhip with BJ whole sale,blame economy for it so i lost privilege to buy value packs that were exclusively sold in store .i was happy that found same deal on amazon and bought it .Dove has no smell but it does give moisturing feeling on skin .I&#x27;ll recommend it for price ,sheer volume ,feeling on skin and  brand name .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update : There is another package of same product for $13.98 but that includes two 24 OZ Dove and one free 9 OZ but this package contain all three of 24 OZ .Do your math what you getting by paying little extra .</li>
    <li> Great product. My husband found these at a great price and loves the body wash.</li>
    <li> been ordering this product over 10 yrs now..this is just one of the varieties I chose..I purchase enough to last a year..which is approximately 7 bottles</li>
    <li> This Dove Body wash is greate for every skin type.   Actually, this was what my son&#x27;s Dermatologist recommended to use.  It is great for sensitive and dried skin type and will leave you soft and fresh.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great shower gel or body wash, this not only smells great and feels luxurious, it really does leave your skin more hydrated after use. And it&#x27;s completely budget-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really does leave your skin feeling hydrated and moisturized. The fragrance does stick around for awhile, so you can decide if thats a good or bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove Body Wash is a new line from Dove that contains NutrimMoisture, a hydrating mix of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;After water, ingredients Soybean Oil and Sunflower Oil are listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove&#x27;s new line of body washes contain NutrimMoisture, a blend of oils and other hydrating ingredients that actually hydrate the top layer of your skin instead of just stripping all of the oils from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regular use, the large bottles should last months.

You might find yourself able to use less lotion or a lotion with a thinner consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend trying it before you buy any other brand. But do make sure the bottle says, \\&quot;NutrimMoisture\\&quot;, because not all Dove Body Washes have NutriMoisture in it.</li>
    <li> nice cool feeling wash</li>
    <li> Makes skin feel smooth and fresh.  Liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove&#x27;s body wash for years. I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist in the past for treatment and recommendations, and Dove works for me. I typically use the [[ASIN:B000AO2NXS sensitive skin formula]] and now I rotate in the go fresh formula to change things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive skin formula may have changed a bit over time, but it&#x27;s been great and I haven&#x27;t had any qualms about it. Go fresh is very, very similar, except that it has a minor cucumber scent. I&#x27;m picky when it comes to scents and how strong they are, but this one&#x27;s OK. Scent aside, this wash leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy, and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m such a creature of habit that I feel naked without Dove on the road. Do yourself a favor - ditch the cheap soap and treat your skin with care. Go Dove or go home!</li>
    <li> the order was fine , thank you</li>
    <li> My wife loves this body was, its cheap, a 3 pack will last her a while, and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s got a lovely, fresh smell, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.  It also lacks the &amp;#34;scrubbing beads&amp;#34; that many products have.  Those beads may feel great, but they don&#x27;t biodegrade, so they&#x27;ve started clogging up sewer systems in some places.</li>
    <li> Great soap. The best I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Anything from Dove is great.</li>
</ol>
