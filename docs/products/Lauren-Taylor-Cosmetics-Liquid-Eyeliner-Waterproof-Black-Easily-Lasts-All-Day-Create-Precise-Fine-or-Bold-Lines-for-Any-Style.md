<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> good product..pen did not come with a plastic or shrink wrap tamper proof wrapping..was a little hesitant to use...good product...takes a little longer to dry compared to others I have used...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this eyeliner to be absolutely waterproof or smudgeproof, especially when used under the eye. I will continue to use another brand which I find is better suited for me. I thought this one might be better, but it was a disappointment for the money.</li>
    <li> Amazing tip for extra thin or wider line, deep black color, doesn&#x27;t fade or smear!</li>
    <li> very easy to use smooth application I love it</li>
    <li> Amazing eyeliner!!!  I will be purchasing again, and again, and again.....</li>
    <li> Love it! Stays put and easy to put on.</li>
    <li> It is the best product i&#x27;ve bought for me so far. I&#x27;m sending also to my sister in Brazil.</li>
    <li> I just started using this eyeliner and I love it. The pen is small and easy to hold and draws a perfect line that lasts my entire work day, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> At first try, it didn&#x27;t go on smooth but after I used it a couple of times it goes on easy and lasts all day without smearing.  I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have had other similar pen-style eye liners that worked great for a couple of applications and then they&#x27;d seemingly just stop working for no apparent reason. This pen is lasting so far and stays on all day. You can get a nice precise line without stretching out your eye-lids.</li>
    <li> I wear a (very) minimal amount of makeup - lipstick and mascara only.  A special event necessitated that I add a little extra to my look, thus the eyeliner.  I am delighted!!  Easy to apply; accentuates my eye color.  I am so please that I&#x27;ve begun to wear the liner every day.</li>
    <li> The BEST eyeliner ever! I used to have permanent eyeliner (which lasts about 3 years) but decided not to have it redone. But I wanted something that would stay on all day without smudging or needing a touch up. This eyeliner fits the bill! It&#x27;s super easy to apply too. I am a forever customer!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this eyeliner.  Love the thin applicator, and the eyeliner stays put throughout the day, and what was surprising, it was easy to remove.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner was easy to apply, and stayed perfect  all day.  I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! Compared to drugstore eyeliners, it is much easier to use to get the desired look.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had , will purchase again .</li>
    <li> Wonderful amazing the rigth wide, beside well packed</li>
    <li> This is a great liner, I tightline a lot and it stays on all day. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> oh my god i love this so much.</li>
    <li> The thinness of the eyeliner is perfect. It lasts all day. Very easy to apply. I love this product and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I waited a few weeks of trying it to make sure that I was pleased in the following weeks as I was when I first opened the package. It is a small pen liner, but so far has been more than I thought it would be. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Not as easy to apply as I had hoped.The applicator did not hold enough&lt;br /&gt;eyeliner to apply to the eyelid an even line in  one smooth motion. I had to keep&lt;br /&gt;replacing the brush into the tube  shaking it and retry the application.</li>
    <li> Really stays on!  And goes on smoothly also.</li>
    <li> Very nice eyeliner.  Stayed on all day at a dance competition and never ran or smudged.  Will buy it again.  Easy to apply, too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner now. It goes on smoothly and stays on most of the day.</li>
    <li> Goes on super smooth and lasts really well. My new favorite! Nice dark black as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome customer service. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different eyeliners and in all the years I&#x27;ve been using, this is the best one! It gives me those perfect lines I need for a cat eye and it doesn&#x27;t smudge or get messy!! I can&#x27;t get over how good this is! I will definitely be buying this again!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eyeliners and this is the best.  I&#x27;ve already ordered another tube.</li>
    <li> The liquid flow is not continuous actually and I have to go couple times over same area to get it filled but it stays whole day long which is pretty good</li>
    <li> I have runny eyes. This is the best I&#x27;ve found for actually staying on, yet washes off without scraping my eyelids like sand paper!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is amazing! I only use liquid eyeliner on a daily basis. A lot of times I have to reapply it because when I walk out in the morning my eye starts to tear up and it ruins my eye makeup. Normally, especially with liquid eyeliners, they smudge and smear and melt all over my eyes from my waterworks. But this eye liner doesn&#x27;t budge! And it comes right off with my facial wash! Also the pigment is very dark and its precision is on point and it&#x27;s very easy to apply! I&#x27;m only sticking to this eyeliner from now on!</li>
    <li> Love the eyeliner. Very easy application and stays on all day!</li>
    <li> Love this product very easy to use.. (I&#x27;m not expert) I would recommend</li>
    <li> Rich black color. Stays on!</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly! I love how smooth it goes on and it stayed on all day.</li>
    <li> Really like this eye-liner. Very Wash to use and it stays on!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and the color is nice and dark.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner.  It is really, truly waterproof but still comes off with makeup remover.  Even though my eyes often water and I take Water Aerobics classes, this eyeliner does not leave me with &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes like so many other brands do on me.  It is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Best Eyeliner and never runs or disappears.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner so far. It&#x27;s easy to use, stays on and isn&#x27;t hard to take off. Glad I got it.  I have reordered several times and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Hard to draw a solid line</li>
    <li> Very smooth application and doesn&#x27;t smudge or fade at all throughout the day. I forgot to take my makeup off one night and it even lasted throughout the night. It still looked perfect the next morning.</li>
    <li> Goes on better than any I have bought and I have bought quite a few different brands.</li>
    <li> I have purchased and used daily Lauren Taylor waterproof liquid eyeliner a few weeks ago. I paired it with a waterproof mascara for use on these very high humidity days and I have never had to reapply within that day. I have oily eyes yet Lauren Taylor&#x27;s product never smudged or thinned. I also have sensitivity to many cosmetics and I have not had any with this product. I am excited to try other Lauren Taylor products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl Christenson</li>
    <li> It glides on with precision and stays on clean all day!</li>
    <li> It is very waterproof.  I like it.  I have allergies.  It stays better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Long lasting, not waterproof. Have been looking for a pen waterproof liquid eyeliner equal to my temporary liner tattoo MAC liquid last eyeliner which can get a little goopy for me. The pen is very thin and handles well, and the application is very black, which I love. At work, this holds up for me until a little after lunch. I just took a nap and woke up a few minutes ago and the eyeliner under my left guy is completely gone in the temporal corner, leaving me a small strip of eyeliner on the lower lid toward the center as you can see in the photo. Right eye has held up fine after nap. I had purchased this because it said waterproof in the title, so I might be a little hard on the review. I tend to tear more than average, so this may work better for other people.</li>
    <li> Have tried many liquid liners and have yet to find one that hasn&#x27;t disappeared by the end of the day but this is one of the few that does last longer then some others.  if going out at night, need to reapply but otherwise, it&#x27;s fine.  easy to apply, dries quickly but not so quickly that you can&#x27;t blend first.  would order again.</li>
    <li> Perfect eyeliner goes on easily and lasts</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve used to date. It definitely trumps stila&#x27;s &amp;#34;stay all day&amp;#34;. Can&#x27;t wait to use it on my upcoming vacation!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Stays on even through swimming!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and stays all day</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner...It&#x27;s perfect for the top lid at the inner eye for a very thin line...It&#x27;s my favorite because of its accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;I have at least 6 other eye-liners.  Not Maybelline (because they test on animals)...Thank you for&lt;br /&gt;a wonderful product and customer service....kindness snow balls...keep up the great work. Erin G.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyeliner! I&#x27;ve actually had compliments on my makeup since I started using this-its so easy to apply and stays on all day!</li>
    <li> Fantastic eyeliner! Very bold and lasts all day (no smearing or flaking)! I get many compliments at work from guests, coworkers and friends. I would definitely buy again and will continue to recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Fantastic eyeliner.  Application is easy, pen is lightweight.</li>
    <li> Product arrived dry and appeared to have been used.  There was no security seal.  Very disappointing</li>
    <li> Best waterproof liquid eyeliner I ever tried.</li>
    <li> I like the very fine point on this....Sometimes I have to re-apply it as it comes off in the corner of my eye...Overall pretty good...</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner! It is easy to apply, goes on smoothly, and has a good dark black color.</li>
    <li> Awesome eyeliner!!!!! Stays all day but is not a pain to get off at night:) arrived quick too !!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yeti but the point will be perfect.  Should have ordered another one.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this eyeliner!! I can put it on before work and by the time I&#x27;m getting ready for bed, it still looks as perfectly as it did when I first put it on. Now if I could just find a mascara that I love this much!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much better than other eye liners that I&#x27;ve tried. I have such long lashes that my mascara still touches my lower eye, but the racoon eyes are much better than before.  I don&#x27;t think you can expect much more of a product.  It obviously does smear if you rub your eyes a lot, but I feel it&#x27;s a lot better than other waterproof product that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Not as dark, shiny black as I wanted. Very thin coming out, had to apply over the same line several times.</li>
    <li> if repeat customers are a sign of a great product, then this has it, hands down! The eyeliner is easy to use; easy to remove and LASTS a full day with no touch ups required. My eyes tend to be sensitive to many products and this has never irritated them...3 - 4th repeat order for me &amp; friends!</li>
    <li> I thought I had already reviewed this... hmmm... I love it and wear it for performances.</li>
    <li> Color very dark, not easy to remove, but too hard for the pen to touch with skin, not easy to make a perfect line with is pen</li>
    <li> Loveeee the eyeliner. Convenient and precise</li>
    <li> NICE.  Smooth, long lasting.</li>
    <li> I used this today and I do really like it. It&#x27;s very black and the felt tip is quite thin so it gives you more control and precision. It dries almost completely matte, which I love. It stays in place and doesn&#x27;t budge!  Disclaimer: this product was sent for a honest, unbiased review</li>
    <li> The best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used! The tip allows for the highest amount of precision and the fluid goes on smoothly and evenly without running. I put it on in the morning and didn&#x27;t have to touch it up at all throughout the day! Amazing</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service!</li>
    <li> I love it! I wasnt sure about buying online but I did and I&#x27;m so glad. Best liquid eyeliner pen I&#x27;ve tried. Better than mac. Stays on all day with no problem. Really easy to apply, whether you want a thin or thick line.</li>
    <li> I went out on a limb and spent about 2x as much as I typically spend on eyeliner, since Physician&#x27;s Formula appears to have downgraded its formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I have to apply eyeshadow under this to prevent it from stamping onto my browbone over the course of several hours. It&#x27;s not horrible, and it looks great, but I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;1-2 forms of makeup&amp;#34; type of person (or so I had been). Meaning I had to buy some cheap eyeshadow for this very purpose, to see if I could make the eyeliner useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much, if you&#x27;re someone who faces the predicament of eyeliner melting onto unintended parts of your face, this is one of the better ones out there but be prepared to apply a &amp;#34;nonstick coating&amp;#34; of powder. Oh and it&#x27;s not that easy to remove either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^If the above truly is your predicament, my tip is to use Revlon Color Stay liquid eye pen. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 days and though the brush is rock solid (be gentle!), it&#x27;s closer to $10 at most drugstores and not melting much. Let me know if you have spiffier ideas :).</li>
    <li> I like it, it doesn&#x27;t last &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; as most reviewers on here as stated. I put it on in the morning and at least lasts through most of the work day and that&#x27;s with and without having eye primer on. I was used to using Stila&#x27;s eyeliner which I will still use but this one is good too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m editing this review after having had this eyeliner for several weeks.  When I got it I was new to the felt tip eyeliner pen product line.  I really love this type of eyeliner, and for me it is a huge improvement over the pencil type of liner.      This particular brand has some terrific aspects.  The color is a deep, shiny coal black, and it really does last all day.  I love the way the cool, wet brush feels.  However, after several weeks of use, I find it difficult to make a smooth, clean line on my eyelid, and the color bleeds onto the bottom lid as I am painting the top lid.  For this reason, I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4.  I still love the way it lasts and the color is great for a deep, dark black.    Since finding this type of eyeliner I then discovered the Stila eyeliner pen, and I found that goes on much better, also lasts all day, and has many beautiful subtle color choices.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it.......  Gave it to her as a gift and she&#x27;s enjoyed learning to use it for diff occasions</li>
    <li> Loved, loved, loved this eyeliner.  It went on very smooth, and did not have any skips or blotches, like I have with other eyeliners.  I was able to wear it in the rain running and it did not drip down my face or give me raccoon eyes.  I was even able to take a shower after my run and did not have to re-apply my eyeliner, so it saved me time as well.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner works great!  Not dry like many other felt-tip liners.  Also, I&#x27;m in agreement with many other reviews that it stays all day and doesn&#x27;t wear/rub off easily.  The tip was a little smaller than I expected, but that didn&#x27;t affect the quality of the product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> At first it seemed like a great product, but over the course of the day it begins to flake - so I&#x27;m not so happy with it&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> The eyeliner works great...It does exactly as expected stays put all day long...I&#x27;m very satisfied...It was also delivered on time in good condition</li>
    <li> I loved this product. My eyes are very sensitive to makeup. Especially when it runs throughout the day. However this product stayed on all day and never ran or smudged till I washed it off. Very easy to apply due to the felt tip. Loved it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole Avila</li>
    <li> Amazing eyeliner, perfect control, perfect eyeliner flow well worth the price best one I&#x27;ve had!</li>
    <li> caused horrible irritation to my eyes... which sucks... because it is easy to glide on and use.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and lasts all day</li>
    <li> best eye liner I have used! easy to apply, stays for long time. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and easy-to-use eyeliner will give you a perfect line! The only minus about it is that it does wear at the inner corners of the eye if left on for a long time, but touching this up will be super-easy.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Personally I think it&#x27;s amazing, I really like the style of the pen! It works so well and doesn&#x27;t seem to smudge! It&#x27;s easy to create different looks with too!&amp;#34;  (Words are from my teenaged daughter who was actual purchaser of this item.).</li>
    <li> This is by far the best liquid eyeliner I have ever used.  It stays on all day and removes easily with my makeup remover.  I have looked for a product like this since I began using liquid eyeliner 30 years ago.</li>
    <li> Produces a fine line so steady hands help application. Last all day!</li>
    <li> Love Lauren Taylor eyeliner!</li>
    <li> The eyeliner that I received showed up broken (it was wrapped in paper, and seemed like it would have been in tact).  It was impossible to even try it out, it&#x27;s useless.  I need to return this.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used eyeliner in a long while....your product was easy to apply and looked really nice.  My husband definitely approved!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Does not flow on too thickly, giving my eyes a natural look, yet with definition.  The pencil arrived quickly in a nicely wrapped envelope. The seller was easy to work with.  I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in quality cosmetics at a reasonable price.  I an also quite satisfied with how my order was handled and how it was delivered.</li>
    <li> This is the best waterproof, everything wet proof liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever purchased! Will def buy again!</li>
    <li> love the eyeliner....</li>
    <li> Decent, pretty waterproof, but it ran out fast...</li>
    <li> This is overpriced crap. The first application is great. The eyeliner stays on all day and is easy to apply, but after the first use it&#x27;s too dry to use! I kept the cap on, and didn&#x27;t have it out for a long period of time, just enough for normal application. DO NOT BUY! One of the biggest wastes of my money recently. It&#x27;s dollar store quality! UPDATE: The seller was really great about getting me a refund and sending me another eyeliner to try out. I still wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the product and will keep my rating ONE STAR. The second time I used this this product it lasted me about a week before it dried out</li>
    <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t mash around like other eye liners does. Dries, and stays! Some fading through the day but very little compared to 16 hours of wear.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent eyeliner---goes on smoothly and makes a crisp thin line.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> This is the first truly waterproof eye liner I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear.  It&#x27;s also easily removed with facial cloths or eye makeup remover.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply, I love it and would definitely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a small pen</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eyeliner that would last all day, that is waterproof and smudge proof.  This totally fits the bill. It&#x27;s a lot easier to apply than I thought it would be.  Love this eyeliner.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Been searching for a good eyeliner and came across this one and per the reviews i decided to try it.  I absolutely love it..  It is soft on the eyelid during application and stays on all day without smearing.  Will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered DHC eyeliner and received Lauren Taylor&#x27;s instead.  I was surprised to see that it is almost as good as the DHC eyeliner and decided  to keep it.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for one+ week so hope it holds out as long as the DHC eyeliner that I have grown to love. Like the DHC liner, it runs smoothly over powdered eye shadow --where most eyeliners fail. The line is as thin or as thick depending on how lightly you press on the tip.</li>
    <li> I love it . Last all day and run very smoothtly. I already recommend this product to all my friends</li>
