<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Feels great! Use it daily!</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft and not too stiff. It is excellent for part of my morning detox routine.</li>
    <li> I just received this shower brush last week and used it for the first time.  Wow, what a great brush!  I am 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; and really like the length of the handle that allows me to easy scrub all of back.  The bristle are soft enough to be comfortable but substantial enough to allow for maximum exfoliation.  It is really made well and for the  price, it cannot be beat.  As I stated in my seller comments, this small company is everything that small business should be and deserves to be supported.  Win-Win for both you and that business.  I am a very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> What a great bath body brush.  I love the fact that you can use it with or without the handle, because you don&#x27;t always need it.  I have used other bath body brushes, and they are good for getting your back but are way to bulky to get your arms or legs.  With this, you can use the handle for your back, then remove it and use it for any other body part.  The bristles are not to soft, but not too hard, just right. All in all you could not ask for a better bath body brush! I would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review at a discounted rate and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
    <li> Brush head has tendency to fall off.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! I like how the handle comes off, so you can easily use it either way!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush!  As a beginner in body brushing, I was a little unsure but this brush is just the right texture and shape.  It feels invigorating but not harsh.</li>
    <li> This is the best body brush I have ever used!  It exfoliates my skin and I can now reach my back!  The bristles are gentle and they do not fall out, unlike some brushes out there! It also helps with getting any dry skin off of my heals.  I love the long wooden handle and the fact that you can take the brush off the handle to get to the places I can reach, without the handle. I also use it on my face, and it has helped face to be more clear and soft.  I really love this brush and I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I would honestly recommend anyone looking for a good scrub brush.  The handle is long enough to reach the middle of my back, and the bristles are perfect  . You can not go wrong with their 30 day money back guarantee. And it is great on the skin makes it nice and smooth, I bought this brush because it had good reviews and great quality. Remember money back guaranteed. This my second purchase but my first review...</li>
    <li> Great bath brush. Love the functionality of the removable head. Creates nice lather with body wash. Bristle stiffness is just right. Perfect for dry brushing without torturing yourself. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> We love it. It&#x27;s not too abravise that it makes me cringe to use it (past experience). My 6 year old loves it as well and uses it on his feet and back with my supervision.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this product thinking it would be stronger than the last brush I had. In my opinion it is not effective and it is actually a cheaper quality than the one I previously purchased.  Sorry to say I am disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve found...thx</li>
    <li> I like this body brush scrub because it is long enough to scrub my back.  It seems to be well-made and sturdy. I thought at first it would be heavy but I didn&#x27;t think so.  The bristles are hard enough to clean but soft enough not to scratch you.  I do believe this scrub brush will last a long time.  I would recommend this body brush to anyone needing help reaching unreachable places.</li>
    <li> Great brush and handle. Highly recommend. Also not to mention very courteous customer service. Let&#x27;s all support family run businesses.</li>
    <li> The handle is long enough to really reach areas that has been so difficult on my back. The bristles are perfect to use everyday to exfoliate my body. The bristles are soft when I run my hand over the brush, which helps to create a gentle lather and scrubbing, but at the same time somehow they exfoliate really well.  I love how I can take the long handle off to work around areas I can reach like my arms and legs. The bristles do not fall out like many I have used in the past and the whole brush looks like it will last me for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> I love using this brush with the wooden handle. It is soft enough yet study enough to clean where I cannot reach on my own. Love the smooth feel of the wood shows it was made with care and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out. I would buy it again for sure. Well worth the the money. Love that you can take off the handle and use it to get to the places you can reach.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a brush like this for a while but every time I looked at one at the store, they were very poorly made and I knew the handle was going to break in one or two uses. I then came across this brush on Amazon and ordered it based on good reviews. I gotta say that this brush delivered! It&#x27;s very well made, and it&#x27;s convenient to use: it reaches down your back and feet without you bending over backwards. The bristles are exfoliating but at the same time gentle enough not to scratch you. My favorite is to use this brush and then put some lotion right after getting out of the shower, my skin is so soft after that! Overall this brush was a great buy and I might have to get a couple more for my family members.</li>
    <li> This brush works really great , it exfoliates the skin without being harsh on it..The handle is really long enough so that it can be used to scrub the back properly.i would recommend using this brush at least every alternate day to keep skin clean n fresh</li>
    <li> At this point, the only negative thing I can say about this brush is I should have gotten two.  One for me and my fiancée because he is always bringing it to the other bathroom! I like that it is detachable with a flat bottom so I can set it on tub and it stays stationary while I put whatever type of scrub or soap on it.  You can use this brush to massage both dry and wet skin.  I love that!  Having just suffered from a pulmonary embolism I cannot get massage yet; But I can do circulatory exercises.  I love the way this boar head brush invigorated my skin.  I have a plain wand I can use, but this this just adds comfort and a level of convenience.&lt;br /&gt;I love the length of brush because I had surgery a couple of months ago and struggle with flexibility.  This allows me to reach the middle of my back without assistance.  After having assistance for so long from those around me it was nice to get a handle long enough that I can gain back some independence.  Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, available at 99 cents stores for $1.00</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:a2c484f782a7e52f0c94ae5fada87d5]] This beechwood Bath Body Exfoliating Brush works really good.It actually worked better than I expected. So far since I received it in the mail I have already been loving the results.I have been using it everyday and it gets all my dried dead skin off.Leaving my skin nice and smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The Brush part can be detached for you to use as a body brush.It has a handy little strap that you can hook your hand into and securely brush your body with.&lt;br /&gt;-Made of beechwood-smooth and no rough edges that will allow splinters to happen&lt;br /&gt;-The bristles are all natural, they are made with goat hair.This really helps in exfoliating my skin.The bristles have not shed on me yet.They have not lost its shape after using for a couple days now since I got this in.Has not deformed in any way since it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;-Makes my skin reveal that natural glow after using and smooth.Easier to apply my moisturizing creams.Does a great job at cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be used for your back or whole body.&lt;br /&gt;-The wood dries up pretty good after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Handle is 16\\&quot; I would of liked it to be a little bit longer for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;-Rope that is tied to the end of the handle is too small to hang on my shower head after use.I have to set it on the tip of the tub to dry.I would have liked to hang this on the shower head for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall my final thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;-Great brush for exfoliating the back or the whole body, made pretty well, helps my skin feel nice,extra clean &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note:This sample was provided at a discount for my honest feedback on this product.</li>
    <li> It is great. Not too soft or too hard, just right!</li>
    <li> Bristles are stiff and too rough on skin. Not for anyone who wants a soft brush with which to wash one&#x27;s back or other hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Very nice bathing and shower brush.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! The bristles are just the right stiffness without being too harsh or too wimpy. The long handle makes it easy to reach every spot on my back and being able to remove the brush head from the handle means it&#x27;s easy to use on my arms and legs as well. Dry skin on my legs is always an issue during the winter months and this brush is great for exfoliating and getting rid of that dry skin before applying lotion. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different bath brushes over the years and I think this is the best one yet!</li>
    <li> Great brush quick shipping</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 brushes; one for home shower use and another for sauna use at the gym.  I love the brush.  It&#x27;s light and easy to handle; quick to scrub and hang to dry.  After the sauna visit, I use the brush to remove all the old loose skin off.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
    <li> The wooden bath brush is wonderful for those hard to reach areas like your back and legs.  It exfoliates well, leaving my skin soft and supple. Since I&#x27;ve started using this, my dermatologist commented on how the acne on my back is clearing up.  I also use it as a back scratcher which is rather nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cellulite massager is outstanding on my thighs and bottom. I can tell a bit difference since I&#x27;ve started using it.  My aunt is having surgery in about a month, and this would make the perfect gift to assist her while showering. I purchased one for her.  Great products and experience all around.</li>
    <li> Very easy and durable brush. Previously I have been unable to use brushes such as these because the bristles fall apart. I didn&#x27;t have that problem with this one. I just put my shower gel on the brush, lather up and scrub away. I love the fact that there is an extra handle for you to use if you chose. This brush by far is the best in its kind. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes in hopes to help me because my mobility is bad in my right hand. The product was high quality and enjoyed the texture feel. Im rating it a 4 because I wish it was a tad longer so it could reach better. Overall really enjoyed the product. I have recommended it to my family and close friends who have the same problem as I do.</li>
    <li> Great product; bristles are just fine.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and product quality exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> The bath body brush is great!  The bristles as soft and the handle&lt;br /&gt;makes it very easy to use.  Although the handle is removable from&lt;br /&gt;the brush, I haven&#x27;t used the brush without the handle.  I am very&lt;br /&gt;satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> as expected very helpful in shower</li>
    <li> Great brush and has yet to fall off the handle.</li>
    <li> Great quality and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Ok, could have purchased at dollar store</li>
    <li> A good product. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good bath body brush. I&#x27;m glad I found this. My back LOVE this brush. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever used, I love the fact that you can remove the long handle and use it without.  The bristles are perfect wether you use it to bathe or to exfoliate.  Another plus is that it isn&#x27;t heavy at all so it is comfortable for people who are not able to hold heavy things for a long time.</li>
    <li> Okay, I have used it several times now and I love it! I thought it looked small at first but it is the right size exactly. The handle too is the right length and width. All in all it is my favorite bath bush I have ever used and the one I will buy as a gift for others when the occasion arises. Thank you for making a quality product!</li>
    <li> simply a great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I have only had it for a week or so and use it every day,  I loved it when I first received it.  It seems to be wearing out already.  Does not seem like it will last much longer.  I hope it does not continue to wear down or I will be requesting a replacement.  I love the removable handle and strap, very helpful.</li>
    <li> The product is just what I wanted when I purchase it.  The bristles are soft but firm.  It helps to exfoliate the skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush that I&#x27;m enjoying very much.</li>
    <li> Built well.  Bristles are pretty firm.  I&#x27;m no sissy, and I can take the firm bristles, I guess it&#x27;s good for exfoliating, if that matters, but it does not feel as good as softer ones I&#x27;ve used.  Some people like that sort of thing, I suppose. Probably people with thick, African wildebeest like skin.  What ever.  I like that the handle comes off and becomes a hand brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is a great addition to my shower.  This is a great company and will be using them a lot in my future.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  The nylon bristle brushes are too harsh, but these natural bristles are perfect for that satisfying back scrub!  It is a better finished product than the last one I purchased at a major discount chain.  Update:  After 6 1/2 months, the brush has begun to come apart. The plastic backing holding the bristles began to crack and separate from the wood portion.  Out of warranty.</li>
    <li> I really needed this bath body brush because I have short arms and I have a terrible time trying to wash my back when I am home alone. The body brush has a long handle which allows me to clean my back properly. The brush bristles are not rough, neither are they too soft, but just right. The brush is detachable but I don&#x27;t need to detach it because I only use the brush to clean my back. However, if I choose to detach the brush, it has a  strap across the back of the brush that gives me a better grip on the brush while using it. The brush also has a string at the end of the brush to use for hanging the brush when I get finish to allow it to dry. The brush is made out of beautiful wood. I feels wonderful and I love using it.  I was able to get the brush for a great price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s great for dry lymph brushing--which is its purpose, NOT to be used wet, I think l (see youtube). The removable head helps reach the whole body. The strap popped off the 3rd time I used it, but I tacked it back on and it&#x27;s working perfectly.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Good brush but falls apart every time I try to use it in the shower just to scratch my back.  Can&#x27;t use it up and down.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised&amp; expected</li>
    <li> I like how it feels on my skin, but is it normal for the bristles to fall out all over the floor? Just used it once, it is brand new, and already tons of bristles out.</li>
    <li> Purchased this instead of the plastic synthetic body brush I always buy at CVS. A lot of the bristles continously fell off. The quality is very cheap. The bristles are bent &amp; wont go back into place rendering them useless. It takes forever to dry &amp; has a funky smell. Useless for dry body brushing &amp; shower</li>
    <li> The shipment was fast. The brush is well made. The only thing I was dissipointed with was  it is too short for my needs. I am disabled,. I need a lomger brush to reach my feet. I will just get something else for my feet, because this brush is great for everything else.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s well made, looks good and is not too hard, not too soft. Love the option of it being hand held for smaller areas. Fast shipping is a plus!</li>
    <li> Good Brush at  a fair price. Use it daily and have not had many bristles fall out. I use it strictly for dry brushing to increase my lymph drainage.</li>
    <li> Received on time and seems very well made and put together. Review were great so I expect to use it for a long time and so far have enjoyed this immensely!!</li>
    <li> Great brush for exfoliating skin. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift and she absolutely LOVES IT!!!!!  Thank you for the love you put into your products!</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Brush skin, shower skin feels softer.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!!! Finally, a bath brush that works. Just firm enough to feel like it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, but not too rough (it may be for some women with delicate skin). The ability to take the head off is a big plus. I can use it all over my body without an awkward handle attached, and slip it back on the handle to reach my back and feet. Well made and dries out quickly. I plan to give at least 2 for Christmas!!!  ******* NOTE:  The plastic piece that holds the brushes loosened and then finally fell off after just 7 months of use about twice a week. The plastic piece isn&#x27;t screwed or tacked into the wooden base as it should be, but rather stapled in with very thin, cheap staples. On mine, two of the staples hadn&#x27;t even made it into the wood. The bruskh part and handle are good, but the brush is cheap because it&#x27;s cheaply made. You get what you pay for!!!</li>
    <li> Great brush, firm, just the way I like it.</li>
    <li> A real disappointment. Not only is this twice as expensive as approximately the same brush at CVS, our local drugstore, it doesn&#x27;t have the rubber nubbies, which I don&#x27;t want, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally the head is significantly smaller, and the bristles are significantly shorter than my previous brush. I haven&#x27;t even taken it out of the plastic bag, and the bristles are already bent over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> Worked almost as expected. The previous brush had more bristles. Overall it works good.</li>
    <li> Love this brush for dry brushing, which I learned about from Kris Carr via her book Crazy Sexy Cancer and Crazy Sexy Life. It shipped quickly, great communication from the company too. I like that I can add the handle to brush my back or remove it to brush legs, arms, etc.</li>
    <li> The brush is great!  I really like how the bristles are soft yet they feel firm enough when you use it that if feels like it&#x27;s actually doing something. I received it very quickly.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s missing bristles and it&#x27;s splintered on the back! i found one at target for $5.</li>
    <li> It works great but when it fell off the hook onto the floor, the brush came apart from handle.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush when it was on sale so it was a great price. I use this one for body brushing after showers and first thing in the morning. The extra long handle is great! This brush was everything I wanted</li>
    <li> I like this body brush scrub a lot. Especial the 14 inches long handle, it allows me to reach all the way to those unreachable areas. And have to mention the beautiful wood handle, it is smooth and comfortable to hold, really nice wood indeed. The bristles are the best part of it. It is soft yet exfoliating well. I like to use it to massage all over as well. It really helps for blood circulation a lot. I even sleep better after that. I give it 5 stars as I think it is really well-made product that rarely available in the market. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Exfoliating brushes I have come across in a long time. With the winter here my skin gets a lot dryer especially my back and I hate when I have a bad itch and my arms are not long enough to scratch it. This a daily product of my shower routine. I love that it is long and there are so many bristles so it holds the soap and gives you an awesome back massage while taking a shower. The bristles are nice and soft and will not irritate or leave your skin sore. This is an awesome brush and I recommend it and give it 5 stars it&#x27;s a spa in your own shower.</li>
    <li> great product and easy to use. wonderful alternative to washcloth. easy drying is a huge perk. remember must hang dry to increase life of brush! all in all a great product</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It has a great weight for really scrubbing your back. The long handle make it so you can reach every inch of your body. The bristles are the perfect combination of stiff yet soft. It holds soap well (unlike some brushes), and still rinses clean easily. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this brush and will continue to buy as needed. It&#x27;s a much better value than anything you will find at big box stores and prices much better than the specialty stores.</li>
    <li> One of the best Exfoliating brushes I have come across in a long time. With the winter here my skin gets a lot dryer especially my back and I hate when I have a bad itch and my arms are not long enough to scratch it &amp; when I do reach, I leave marks behind with the itch! This is now a daily product of my shower routine. I love that it is long and there are so many bristles so it holds the soap and gives A Great back massage while taking I&#x27;m showering. The bristles are nice and soft and will not irritate or leave your skin sore. This is an awesome brush and I&#x27;m glad I got to try it out for my honest &amp; Unbiased review!</li>
    <li> What a fantastic deal on a versatile product! I&#x27;m so excited about getting the chance to review this product. What&#x27;s really great about this product is that you can pull off the brush to hand scrub all your smaller parts, like elbows, feet, and knees, and put it back on the handle for getting hard to reach parts, like your back! Scrubbing your back with this brush feels SOOOO relaxing! It&#x27;s all natural and the bristles feel awesome. You&#x27;ll get lots of use out of this product and it&#x27;s a great deal! What do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> ... and it works. Need to make sure you push it well on the handle, otherwise it will fall off.</li>
    <li> This brush is great, soft and holds soap for a great back scrub.I ordered another !</li>
    <li> I love my new bath brush. It is long enough to reach my feet and the bristles are sturdy but not sharp.</li>
    <li> AWESOME Boar Bristle brush... easy to use.  Invigorating and stimulating for skin sloughing and new growth.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to exfoliate my skin and deal with the acne I develop on my back. So far , it has been really effective in reducing my skin issues and keeping my skin healthy rather than oily. Generally speaking, it&#x27;s not easy to lather on soap in the shower, so having a body brush is an underrated yet necessary hygenic utensil. This thing is very sturdy compared to past brushes I&#x27;ve purchased, and  the bristles are just the right amount of thickness and quantity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered similar body brushes in the past only to be disappointed in their quality but this brush was the opposite!  This brush is well made, the brush head can be removed from the long handle if needed.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles feel great against my skin when scrubbing, not too hard not too soft just perfect.  The long handle is very useful when I need to reach those &amp;#34;hard to reach&amp;#34; places, like my back.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend anyone to order this brush if you&#x27;re looking into it!</li>
    <li> This is the first negative review I have written in the many years I have been an Amazon customer.  For the money, this brush was an ABSOLUTE disappointment.  The ONLY way your hand will fit in the strap on the back of the brush is if you are a 5 year old child with small hands.  The brush head is a measly 4-1/2&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34; - very small and very ineffective.  The bristles are soft, offering no stimulation when scrubbing in the shower.  VERY disappointed - I gave it away because it just did not meet my needs.  The only positive I can offer is that it was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Want to use for everyday massage!</li>
    <li> just getting into dry brushing.  I love my new brush!</li>
    <li> Handle keeps coming off so only 4 stars. Other than that annoyance, dry brushing is quite invigorating and motivates me to take better care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some others, I did find the brush to rough for my face, but it is a good texture for the rest of my body.</li>
    <li> A good bath brush is always something great for a woman’s bathroom supplies. Being able to find a nice brush at affordable price is always something exciting. The Bath Bruah by Brusy Brush came at a great price, much less than the similar back brushes my Mom buys for the same reason, and they work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the detachable handle, as it makes it a lot easier to decide the exact way I am going to use this brush when I am in the shower. I am all about versatility and options. The brush is very affective at exfoliating and it is very attractive at well, obviously made from good materials that will hold up for a long time and will not need to be replaced right away, which is another added bonus to the brush.</li>
    <li> I read about the dry brush technique for detox and exfoliation on a natural living blog that I follow and decided to try it out. It seemed simple enough but they did suggest finding a quality brush that was easy to hold. The movements for dry body brushing are circular and cover the entire body so it would have to be something that would not tire my hands out. When I got the brush I used it that same night and it was definitely well made and easy to hold. It didn’t slide out of my hands while brushing even hard to reach parts of my lower legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re thinking of doing dry body brushing or just want help with extra exfoliation in the shower then this brush is it!</li>
    <li> Not too hard not too soft just right</li>
    <li> Love my bath body brush, it is great!! Delivered on time, great quality. Would order again!</li>
    <li> I wanted a shower brush, but I certainly didn&#x27;t expect the slip-shod manufactured tool that I received. The brush won&#x27;t stay connected to the extension handle when hanging in shower. I never did enjoy making a purchase of a worthless product. Don&#x27;t buy one, it won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Great brush for body brushing.  Bristles are just right and it feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great brush it feels good on my skin but I wish the strap were a little smaller as it falls off my hand.  &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great natural bristles. Not too stiff our too soft. Arrived quickly. Works great for dry brushing!</li>
    <li> The brushes wood backing split and is cracking  with in three days of receiving it.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Quality. Ordered a second one! The bristles are great and it really works.  Arrived timely and well packaged. The dual functionality is very useful.</li>
    <li> This is the brush of all bath body brushes!  It is versatile, allowing me to utilize it with both the long handle (for those hard to reach places), and as a hand held brush to concentrate on my legs, knees, arms, and elbows.  This is my favorite bath accessory!  I simply love how it exfoliates my skin leaving me feeling silky smooth.  After a long day, I can soak and use my brush and it magically melts all the stress away AND it is perfect for improving circulation.  This bath body brush makes me feel like a queen with a hand held super spa at my command.  I highly recommend this brush to anyone that wants soft, supple skin that gently brushes away dry, dead skin leaving you with a natural glow.  Two thumbs up for a fabulous product!</li>
    <li> The brush is aaesome. I was very skeptical before it was purchased but wanted to try. Glad I did. It&#x27;s rough yet gentle. Hard enough to feel it is cleaning the body and not just rubbing.  Gives a great lather.</li>
    <li> A good bath brush is hard to find. I have tried many, and have found nothing comparable to a good boar bristle brush. Man has not made a brush that can compare to what is found in nature. The detachable handle is a great touch. It&#x27;s nice to be able to use it as a handheld scrub brush or a handled brush. The versatility is what sold me on it.</li>
    <li> This is my first dry brush and I have been pleased with the results.  My skin was softer after a week of use and the bristles are comfortable.  The customer service is amazing, very responsive.</li>
    <li> I really like this body brush scrub, I feel 100% clean now knowing I was able to scrub my back. The handle is long enough to really reach areas that has been so difficult on my back. The bristles are perfect to use everyday to exfoliate my body. I love how I can take the long handle off to work around areas I can reach like my arms and legs. The bristles do not fall out like many I have used in the past and the whole brush looks like it will last me for a while. I can tell the brush is made with care and the wood is cut smoothly. I would give this a 5 star the only thing that I have to take the handle off the head of the brush instead of letting it fold into the head of the brush. I guess you cannot really do that with wood. Other than that I love this brush scrub!!</li>
    <li> My fiance is going to love this brush when it arrives at our home. Basically, I know he  will be completely clean the entire year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason for me purchasing this brush is because he half cleans his back, and I will not allow him to use my back brush. I have the same exact brush, and the boar bristles are not rough and I always feel squeaky clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best features is the removable handle, which makes this back brush unique from others I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, now I can easily scrub my back! The handle is nice and long enough. I like that it&#x27;s wooden: it will last a lifetime. The  bristles are soft and can scrub at the same time, does great job at exfoliating.  I like to use it as a cellulite massager as well, since the handle is detachable it&#x27;s super easy to do that. Definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> This is a great shower brush – not too hard and not too soft!  Does the job without causing any skin irritation!  Great product ! 👍😀</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I use it in the shower to exfoliate before moisturizing or using self tanner. So far it&#x27;s been wonderful! I love that I can detach the handle.</li>
    <li> I receive my brush and within 2 hours used it. I dry brushed my skin before my shower and WOW what a difference it made. My skin is soft and smooth as when I use a skin scrub. The nice thing is I can use it before every shower. The size of the handle is just right to reach my back and I really like the hand strap on the detatable head of the brush. The stiffnes of the brush is just right. Great price and good investment.</li>
    <li> feels good, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing the job I intended as of yet (only ben using it for a week so far). I&#x27;m try to use it as an exfoliator before my showers. I&#x27;m giving it another 2 weeks and if I do not notice an improvement I&#x27;m going to have to try a brush with more rigorous bristles.</li>
    <li> The back brush is as described and gets the job done. It came with two face brushes which my wife found useful.</li>
    <li> This is a well-made product. It&#x27;s nice when you find high quality products at a great value.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush for dry brushing. It is a higher quality that the one from health food store.</li>
    <li> Feels amazing.  Really helps with shaving.  Use it on dry skin prior to shaving legs, no nicks, no irritation after shaving!! Life changer! Very happy with this brush, recommending it to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> Best things for body comfort at ANY price. Very happy with this brush. Delivered almost overnight, surprised me how quickly I got my order after placing it. Again, this brush is a quality product, if anything, under-rated. I&#x27;d pay twice as much without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Brush is soft but handle keeps falling  off.</li>
    <li> Great body exfoliating brush! Durable long handle makes it easy to get to the hard to reach areas of my back, and easier to wash my legs and feet. Removable handle is a nice feature, but I just leave it on. The bristles aren&#x27;t too rough, and I think, do a great job of removing dead skin and exfoliating. I&#x27;ve noticed softer skin since I&#x27;ve began using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush to use with cellulite cream that I purchased on Amazon. The handle is removable so it is easy to use it for your thighs and legs. It works great for exfoliating the skin; I feel so fresh and clean after I take a shower. I can put the handle back on when I want to use it in the shower to scrub my back or remove it for legs and arms. It works so much better than those puff ball things that look ugly hanging in your shower. My skin feels so soft after taking a shower when I use this brush.</li>
    <li> Well, where can i start? I am so much in love with this brush to the point that i take it with me every time i go out of town. My husband got it for me as a Christmas gift. The best feature about this brush is that it consists of two parts: a head and a handle, so i can attach the handle to the head as needed. It is also made out of very high quality material, and it is very durable at the same time. The bristles are made out of premium boar and the rest is beechwood. The handle is 16 inches long and i can reach the most unreachable parts of my body. On the top of that when i use it, it feels like the best massage ever. It feels great and i wouldn&#x27;t trade this brush for nothing.</li>
    <li> very high quality brush</li>
    <li> I like the brush unfortunately the brush broke on the first use. We were unable to try it on our back😔</li>
    <li> Just started to try out &amp;#34;dry &amp;#34;  brushing !!  And This brush is the perfect size , it&#x27;s not to soft nor to rough , the detachable handle also is great for that hard to reach area in the middle of the back ..  Good quality !!</li>
    <li> I love my new brush, it&#x27;s not too sharp and is just rough enough that my skin feels exfoliated without being raw. I only use these brushes in the bath so I don&#x27;t know about using it dry but it also lathers really well so I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I think the best feature is the detachable part because that way I don&#x27;t have to have two brushes and can use it for all areas without the long handle getting in the way – or add the handle and reach my back which is heaven. It seems pretty well made so I expect it should last a while too. Good item !</li>
    <li> I saw a video that the girl used the brush dry to remove dry skin and to help with cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;So since I just purchased this and have used it from the feet (brushing upward towards the&lt;br /&gt;heart) only for a short period of time all I can&#x27;t really say if its good for cellulite. But I am pleased&lt;br /&gt;that it has the &amp;#34;hand holder&amp;#34; attached to it just in case the long handle breaks off.</li>
    <li> The bristles on other brushes I have tried flatten after the first use and don&#x27;t straighten out after. The bristles on this brush remain in good shape after repeated uses.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Happy about&lt;br /&gt;The removable handle. Must have</li>
    <li> The handle isnt real sturdy and frequently comes apart from the brush. Works great without the handle on everything but those hard to reach areas- like the back!</li>
    <li> It works fine but the head keeps falling on the handle. Still a nice quality brush</li>
    <li> I am really surprised at how the quality of the bath brush has improved the quality of my skin. My skin is really dry, living in the desert.&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliating and soft bristles make my baths perfection when using my bath salts.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans easy under hot water and  a paper towels to get rid of the flakes of skin from exfoliation. Will not share my brush with anyone for sanitary reasons. I love the long handle since I have short arms ans a bad back. The duel purposes enhaced with this product compared to other brushes impresses me and instead of 5 items to carry on vacation, I just need t carry this one item.</li>
    <li> I love my new Bath/body scrub brush, it works very well at exfoliating my skin.  With the long handle I can scrub those hard to reach areas like my back and I can reach the back and bottom of my legs with very little bending, that&#x27;s a huge help since I have back problems and can&#x27;t bend much.  The handle is removable and there is a strap on it, that is very convenient for washing scrubbing the rest of my body.  The handle goes on and off very easily and can be done while in the shower or out of the shower.  I use my brush in the shower, once I&#x27;m done with my shower I just rinse the brush off and let it hang from my shower hook.  The handle is made of a beechwood, the wood is very smooth and there are no splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to purchase the body brush at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> The brush is an excellent &amp;#34;dry body brush.&amp;#34;  Not too stiff, but stiff enough.  I can&#x27;t comment on the handle due Amazon&#x27;s very poor shipping methods - it arrived quite soiled and I did not want to use it.  That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars, as I don&#x27;t know how well the handle works.</li>
    <li> My brush is shedding little bit but I&#x27;m hoping it stop and works out for the best to get all benefits from dry brushing ;)</li>
    <li> Great Dry Brush. Not too soft and not too hard. Also it&#x27;s handy to be able to remove the brush when needed.</li>
    <li> Works great. Comfortable enough for my first attempt at dry brushing. Not exactly a pleasant feeling but very effective.</li>
    <li> Good brush, its really long and scrubs the dead skin off well. It takes a little while to dry, so I clean it after using because I worry about bacteria. The strap is useful but would not be good for someone with very large hands, but works well for me. It does scrub pretty hard so a little scrubbing goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush!  Long handle, and easy to use and store. Detachable loofah is high quality! Great for someone who has a problem reaching their back</li>
    <li> This is great for many reasons!  1) the long handle makes it easy to reach the unreachable parts of your back. 2) The bristles aren&#x27;t too scratchy or hard, but they aren&#x27;t too soft, so they clean well. 3) The price is great for what you get! I am a big fan of these brushes. I got some for myself but I&#x27;ll be getting more for gift throughout the year!</li>
    <li> Nice brush for getting your back and those other hard to reach places.  Helps with exfoliating your skin and leaves it feeling soft.  I really like that you can detach the handle, it makes it much more versatile.  All around good product, especially for the cold winter months to keep skin healthy.</li>
    <li> Quality product, and feels great on your skin!!</li>
    <li> How can you get excited about a body brush? I have never, ever been an advocate of exfoliation. This was not because of any negative feelings towards it; I just never felt it was necessary. I decided to try this based on other reviews and it exceeded my expectations. It is well-designed; easy to take apart and put back together, so that scrubbing your back and entire body is easy. The brush rinses clean without having to use your hands to rub out the soap residue. It also dries quickly. I feel less itchy, now that I am using this brush, regularly. I had to order more for the rest of my family! Because it&#x27;s made of what seems to be unfinished wood (I am not a craftsman by any stretch of the imagination), it does get discolored, but to no ill effects. If the maker wants an idea on how to improve this, I would recommend either making the hanging loop bigger or including a small hanger for hooking over the shower door or rod. That would make it perfect!</li>
    <li> The handle presses into the brush part.  Too much pressure caused the head of mine to split.  I was able to super glue it back and it works fine.  Just don&#x27;t think I should have had to do that so soon in ownership (only a few months).</li>
    <li> A good, solid brush for dry brushing.</li>
</ol>
