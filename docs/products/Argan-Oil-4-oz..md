<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Helps soften the beard</li>
    <li> The oil is thick and it stays oily on the skin unlike like argan oil i have tried.</li>
    <li> Nice not to heavy. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have much scent to it. The delivery was really fast.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product because it is so much like canola oil, I am convinced that it is actually regular refined oil.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft and helps a lot with the dryness</li>
    <li> I really like Argan oil, it&#x27;s one of the only oils I found that was non-comedogenic for my skin. I have very sensitive skin, and SLS and fatty alcohols break me out. Considering most moisturizers have fatty alcohols, lanolin, or petroleum, argan oil for me was perfect since it&#x27;s only one ingredient. I apply it at night since it is kinda thick on the skin which leaves a shiny residue for an hour until it sinks in, and it &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; on the skin. It&#x27;s hard to explain unless you&#x27;ve tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the best price on Amazon to find Argan Oil. Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with an eye dropper, but I&#x27;m sure you can find one cheap in your local store.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It&#x27;s a perfect all-year moisturizer that never feels greasy. I live in Minnesota and the season changes are fairly extreme--summer is hot and humid whereas winter is very cold and dry, which can definitely do a number on my skin. I have very dry skin and have used coconut oil in the past to great affect, though I like how argan oil absorbs much faster and  doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my skin. It&#x27;s nice to have another good natural moisturizer  to turn to when my skin is feeling sad.&lt;br /&gt;In response to some reviews here that say there&#x27;s no way this is argan oil, I researched the company and their website, and they are legit. They started out as a wholesale supplier to soap makers. This isn&#x27;t food grade argan oil but it&#x27;s definitely good for the skin. Just because it&#x27;s a low price doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t real.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil, it&#x27;s my first time using argan oil and I will continue to use it because of all the great benefits.</li>
    <li> I bought the Josie Maran Argan oil and it light with a slightly nutty smell (but pleasant). This product has no odor at all and is of a thicker consistency. Not sure if it is genuine argan oil or perhaps diluted with another oil but either way it is definitely not the same good quality as Josie Maran Argan oil.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, frizzy hair. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried every oil out there, but they all left my hair oily as if the oils haven&#x27;t penetrated my hair, but rather sits on top, making it oily and frizzy at the same time. Granted, my hair has changed over the years with age and not for the better. I thought that this is going to be my lot in life as far as my hair is concerned. WELL...I bought this oil as a last ditch effort. The one oil I haven&#x27;t tried yet is argan oil, so I thought I had nothing to lose based on the reviews . My hair is now shiny, soft, manageable, and NOT greasy! I absolutelty love this oil! I think the key is that argan oil&#x27;s molecule is much finer, so it penetrates the hair shaft.  This is what I do : after shampooing I towel dry. I let it air dry a bit. Then I take about 4-5 drops of this oil and disperse it on the ends first then along the shaft, going sparingly close to the roots. I blow dry but not fry my hair,then I take 2-3 more drops of this oil and seal it my when my hair is done with the blow dry. My hair now is like when I was young! Shiny, soft, and straight! I love it! AND... There&#x27;s so much of it, it will last a very long time!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I mix it with my regular lotions and creams.  It has no odor.  Absorbs right away.  Leave the skin soft but not greasy at all!  I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to grow nails&lt;br /&gt;They are thin and break easily when they&lt;br /&gt;even begin to grow out&lt;br /&gt;I apply this to my nails off and on through the day,&lt;br /&gt;just a tiny drop on each nail after washing my hands,&lt;br /&gt;and again every night before bed&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in my life, I have long pretty nails&lt;br /&gt;A great option over expensive fake nails for those who&lt;br /&gt;have trouble growing them&lt;br /&gt;I also use a little drop with my face lotion and have noticed my&lt;br /&gt;wrinkles have diminished&lt;br /&gt;High recommend for face and nails</li>
    <li> I purchased this bottle the same time I bought Life-flo argan oil so I could see if they were the same. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I love the price and also the size helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Bottle was full to the top. NICE!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using argon oil on my face for a few years and it has certainly made a difference in texture and dryness. Great peoduct that you can use on all body parts..hair, nails, face, dry skin on elbows and knees. love it</li>
    <li> I love the argan oil.  It is easily absorbed into the skin.  I can add it to other lotions or just by itself.  My skin looks better than it ever has, using on a regular basis.  I also have other oils but they don&#x27;t absorb like this argan oil does.  I highly recommend it to anyone with a dry skin disorder as I have.</li>
    <li> I bought this to improve my complexion and it really works. The price was excellent and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My skin has had redness and some dark spots for years.  After using Argan Oil for about 3 weeks I see a noticeable improvement!</li>
    <li> I found that it was no better than olive oi.  I used it every morning and expected to see a reduction in wrinkles and dry skin.  It absorbed nicely but I saw no visable improvement.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried Argan Oil you will be pleasantly surprised at the texture, smell, and moisturizing properties. It is non-greasy, clean, and absorbs quickly so one is not walking around looking like a shiny Vaseline accident. I use it primarily for my two boys hair to enrich and give a healthy glow without a thick Cab Calloway grease look. What I also discovered is that it is excellent for skin moisturizing. Shaving is hard on my face so I alternate between Argan Oil and shea butter. I had a rash/irritation that I could not shake with neosporin, but the argan oil cleared it up. This brand is pure and very, very light. I&#x27;ve used other argan oil products that were good but they were combined with other natural oils and had a thicker texture. The con is of course the price to quantity ratio. One can buy a mega trough of lotion from Costco for what you pay for this little bottle, but if healthy looking hair and skin from natural products is something important to you, cut back on a couple of burgers and buy this item. To help save, I purchased a cheap plastic pump bottle, the kind you get for travel, and use that to dispense. Pouring into one&#x27;s hand will cause a vanishing effect. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This argon oil is not only affordable it is pure in product for the face. I have combination skin, the other argon oils I have tried have been overly oily and make me break out. I have been using this one for 4 months and I have never had acne problems.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have any smell, like other argan oils, such as MoroccanOil, but otherwise great. It makes my hair super shiny and doesnt dry sticky. Super good deal.</li>
    <li> I love the argan oil.  It&#x27;s not too oily and makes my skin feel soft.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  You could even add a couple of drops of your favorite essential oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  My face looks so much brighter.  Feels so much softer.I highly recommend it.  I use it in the evening.</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccan oil for years but was looking for a similar oil that was less expensive.  Read the reviews and thought for the price-- I&#x27;d try this. The minute I opened the bottle, I knew immediately there was no comparison. This oil is heavier and nothing like Moroccan oil. I put a small amount in my hair and it weighed it down and made it hard to style. If you are a loyal Moroccan oil user looking to save a buck, don&#x27;t bother here-- you&#x27;ll be highly disappointed. Lesson here: sometimes it pays to pay more.</li>
    <li> Love putting this in my hair before I blow-dry or use any heating elements. Makes it smooth and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;Price was just up my alley too - very inexpensive</li>
    <li> This oil is lighter than the moisturizers I had been using. My skin feels refreshed when I use it on my face and hands. I&#x27;ve even used a little bit on one of my dogs who has dry skin. (I used it only on a small patch to see whether it will help her.)&lt;br /&gt;I thought the price was affordable, and it was certainly less expensive than the big-name labels on the same basic product. The 4-oz size was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would have wanted was some sort of dropper or a dispenser top on the bottle. My complaint is directed towards the packaging not the argan oil itself, and I didn&#x27;t want to downgrade my review for the product. I went out and bought a cheap plastic bottle that you can put shampoos, etc., in for traveling.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for dry skin.  It is light, soaks into the skin quickly &amp; still has viscosity which makes it a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Essential Depot for a couple of years now and love their products.  Argan oil can be is very expensive but luckily I have found Essential Depot to get my oil.  Excellent price and as good as the expensive brands out there!  I use it for my hair to keep it soft and moisturized.  It is excellent for your skin as well.  Don&#x27;t overpay just because it is a name brand.  This is an excellent oil!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, love it!</li>
    <li> I have problem with eczema and have been trying every natural oil.  But I find this one the best.  Light and yet it keeps the moisture.  I like the fact that it does not smell either.  I am nearly finishing my first bottle and will definetely buy another one.</li>
    <li> This is the best price for pure Argan oil I&#x27;ve found online, and the quality is the same as products that cost a lot more per oz.!  I am very, very happy with it and use it by itself and mixed with other oils on my hair, skin, and nails.  It works wonders!  I wish it came with a dropper cap, but that is a very small issue that&#x27;s easily solved.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this brand from now on!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend and find this  to be Great Argan oil at a great price! I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I choose this product because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the higher amounts on brand name Argan oil.  I was not disappointed!  To me it feels just as good going on as the brand name oils.  This is a great value!  This is my 2nd bottle and it was shipped just as quickly as the first time I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be without this!  Especially in this cold....very moisturizing, but not greasy at all.  Love it!  Would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This oil was really good.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be high quality because of the price, but the quality was just as good as other more expensive argan oils that I have used. This was a good buy and the price was great. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great price for quantity and quality. There are lots of argan oils on the market of all different qualities and prices... this one I found to be great for the money!</li>
    <li> Will buy again.  I love this stuff.  Good price and great packaging.  Love how it makes my skin feel.  Received very quickly as well.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my hair as well as castor oil and emu oil.  I am an African American woman, and these oils make my hair very manageble.  I also am using this oil for my strectch marks while pregant.</li>
    <li> I love ESS Argan Oil and love the 4 oz bottle as it lasts longer.  This company is high quality&lt;br /&gt;comes wrapped in bubble wrap very quickly.  Have ordered from them for years.  Keeps my&lt;br /&gt;face soft and clear.</li>
    <li> I bought this argan oil for my mother who suffers with really dry skin due to her diabetes.  Out of all the creams she has tried that are made specifically for diabetics she says this argan oil works the best.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality is great!</li>
    <li> The last time we ordered Argan OIl, we purchased the much more expensive HSI brand and it was clearly a very high-quality product.  This time we thought we&#x27;d try to save almost $10 and ordered this brand.  Never again.  It is heavy, oily, and makes our hair look and feel as if it hasn&#x27;t  been washed in a week.  We tried using much smaller amounts, but it didn&#x27;t matter.  Might as well have used olive oil. It might be good for skin - we&#x27;ll see.  But for hair?  Nope.  Sticking to the other stuff form now on.  It&#x27;s worth the extra $$.</li>
    <li> I used this oil in my first batch of lip balm. Worked great.  I will order this again...maybe even larger volume</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a chemist, but it seems and acts and smells (no smell) like the more expensive ones I bought. It just doesn&#x27;t have a dropper so that could create problems. But I just ordered some 1 oz cobalt bottles and now I have one for each bathroom, one for purse, one for car. The oil is amazing. I&#x27;ve discovered some unmentioned uses for it. Replaces other products I used to use for same application. It came in a hard box, well protected.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t scented as other argan oils I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s a light, not too heavy, product for my natural hair.  I mix it with water to distribute better as the water helps to &amp;#34;penetrate&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for skin, hair, and using as a carrier oil for aromatic essential oils.  Very good for winter skin.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The quality of this stuff seems to change. Sometimes it&#x27;s as good as Pura D&#x27;Or other times it&#x27;s really more of a body moisturizer than something you would use on your face.</li>
    <li> I think its fake. But thats what I get for a cheaper price. Not a good product.</li>
    <li> Since this is 100 percent oil you get a lot for your money. I shared it with a friend who was troubled by dry, itchy scalp and dry-looking colored hair. It made an obvious difference. I use a bit it after shampooing and to keep my hair looking well-groomed when it&#x27;s humid, which is most of the time in Oregon. I can smooth a drop over my hair day after day without weighing my hair down. I do have dry hair, though. When my skin is really dry, I also like to add argan oil to my moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> this is a great value for a great product.  i have psoriasis, so the argan oil helps keep the scales away.  i most definitely will be getting this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing but, this bottle of oil smell, acts, and absorbs exactly the same as the same oil I paid twice the price for in my local health store!</li>
    <li> Great price for a product that is just plain wonderful, particularly when teamed with hyaluronic acid which you can buy in bulk and mix yourself---check it out on Amazon reviews.  Paid quite a lot more per ounce for this oil which is good for fixing the frizzies after shampooing, and even better for plumping skin and making it soft as silk.  Team it with HA, try it for a couple weeks, go off it for a couple weeks, then try it again to see the difference. You absolutely will see a difference and you won&#x27;t be going without it again.</li>
    <li> My husband is a bicyclist, so his face and neck get weathered by sun and wind.  He started using this oil at the recommendation of his parents, and the difference is absolutely amazing!  The deeper creases have disappeared, and he looks ten years younger!  I recommend this for wrinkles.  I understand it has other benefits, but I haven&#x27;t used it for anything else yet. I will update if I find something else that&#x27;s as amazing as the wrinkle removing properties.</li>
    <li> Spilled everywhere (which was user error) but after that it wasn&#x27;t fun to use because it covered my hands in the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that though, this didn&#x27;t help my hair or skin at all. It didn&#x27;t make it worse, but definitely didn&#x27;t help or improve. So overall, I paid for no effect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s seems to work well, but the feel and smell of the oil is not what I expected. I&#x27;ve used other argan oils and they all have had that nutty smell. It feels heavy and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly.</li>
    <li> Very good oil, for a very good price.  We will buy form them again.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, no odor or fragrance smell, absorbs quickly. Now, to see if it really works, we&#x27;ll have to test it for more than 1 day. I&#x27;ll update my review in a week or so.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is diluted to the point where you can&#x27;t even smell the nutty scent.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it is nothing bad that they mixed it. But probably just some cheap GMO oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware!</li>
    <li> This stuff was processed. It smelled somewhat sterile. I was not a fan.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil. It is not a thick oil so it&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or oily film on the skin. I also added some to my favorite lotion to use as a body lotion. It leaves the skin feeling smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> Great oil for soap making!</li>
    <li> Since Moroccan Oil is expensive and has fillers (although it smells fabulous), I decided to try this as the price is great and there are no fillers.  It&#x27;s a fairly thick oil so you don&#x27;t need much.  I use it on my nails before lotion as I have dry, brittle nails and it seems to be helping.  To put on my hair, I use a nickel size portion and rub my hands together, then put it on my hair (I have long hair).  You have to be careful or you can use too much and your hair will look like it needs to be washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this, although it would be better if it had a pleasant smell (there is no smell at all).</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil.I use it on my hair as a conditioning hair oil and it works great as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product was well priced and has worked well for hair and skin care</li>
    <li> I really like this one wish it had a dropper that came with it that&#x27;s the only thing that could make it better  </li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> I just received mine. I&#x27;ve never used it before either so I have nothing to compare it to. However, I was really surprised there is no scent. In the description it talks about being used in aromatherapy so no idea why there&#x27;s no scent but again, this product is new to me. I tried it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb as well as what other people have said. So as of right now I&#x27;m underwhelmed, but hopefully with more use that will change.</li>
    <li> I have used other brands of morrocon oil in the past and of course you get what you pay for.  This is false advertising.  This is like using canola oil and leaves hair greasy and dirty looking.  I have already ordered my old brand and will chucking this in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I use it for everything, my hair, skin, face, wonderful stuff, will buy again, best price</li>
    <li> Recevied a refund, Product too watery, not sure if its really oil.</li>
    <li> This is straight up argan oil no fussy fancy packaging just the real deal. Excellent on hair and skin. Love this product and the company. Shipping was very fast and well packed. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The first argan oil I bought was on Amazon and came in a blue bottle.  I loved it and went through the bottle quickly.  Due to cost considerations tho,  when I needed more, I got this...a few bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my dryest skin, my feet and elbows.  Its OK.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb as well and it stays oily on my hands.  The residue is alright for my feet but I don&#x27;t love it on my hands.  I do leave greasy fingerprints after using it.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great on Skin and hair</li>
    <li> Kind of leaves your hair stiff, you get what you pay for. Seems to not be absorbed by the hair.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot! I put it on after I wash my face to keep moisture in (this winter has been really tough on my skin). It keeps my skin soft &amp; supple. And the price is VERY reasonable compare to other vendors.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful. I have paid a lot of money for a two ounce bottle so this is a bargain. There is no smell and it makes your skin feel very nice. The only thing that would make it better is a bottle with a dropper type lid. I will definately continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this oil however it does come with a dropper or a pump. it is great for hair or skin</li>
    <li> good quality for the price</li>
    <li> Great buy  on Argan Oil. A little goes a long way in protecting and conditioning hair because of the heat from the blow-dryer and straightener.</li>
    <li> I think that the size is good for the price.  I have been using it since October last year.  I cannot attribute the health of my hair to any one product. It is your methods that make a difference.  At least I can say that it has not had any detrimental effect on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin, and have been experimenting with natural oils for about three years. Almond or apricot kernel oil just  doesn&#x27;t do the job, and Emu oil, while I love it for the winter, can be a bit greasy. Coconut oil is nice once in a while but also can be greasy. This Argan oil moisturizes my skin perfectly. It sinks in without a greasy residue and I no longer get flakes around my nose and mouth. It has no odor and does not make me break out. I use this by itself, or sometimes layer it under my Physicians Formula Tinted moisturizer. I would highly recommend this product. If you do get it and it has a weird smell you might want to send it back, as all oils can go rancid or oxidize with heat. If you live in a hot area you might want to keep your oil in the fridge, it will help slow the oxidization.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve tried!  I lost my bottle of it after only having it for a month or so and just ordered 4 more bottles because I can&#x27;t live without it now!  2 are for gifts, but I had to get a back up bottle!  I have naturally curly long hair and nothing has made my hair shinier and softer, it also stays in place without all the flyaways.  Bonus is that it makes my rough hands so soft too.  Only fault is that I wish it had a dropper.</li>
    <li> This is a cheaper and less effective treatment. I still have dryness in the same spots started using 100 % vitamin E over it and then makeup.</li>
    <li> I paid more for one ounce of this at a local health food store, than I paid for four ounces through this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is wonderful.  It absorbs into the skin in a few minutes, so doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy.  A friend turned me onto it.  Their daughter has always had skin problems and her doctor recommended it.  It&#x27;s the only thing that helps her.  He also loves it for sunburn, as it doesn&#x27;t leave him all greasy.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Use this in my homemade beard oil and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great value.  The bottle is very sturdy glass.  I dropped it on the floor from ~5 feet and no damage to the bottle.  The oil itself is good quality with no smell.</li>
    <li> Good price and the label states it is pure Argan oil which it is important.</li>
    <li> I love this product&lt;br /&gt;It exceeded my expectations&lt;br /&gt;Have tried other brands before but this is&lt;br /&gt;by far the best&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for natural hair</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is cheaper</li>
    <li> my wife loves this argan oil.  she applies on top of her daily moisturizer, and mixes with glycerin + water to create a nice spritz for hair and body (which i&#x27;ve started to use as well).</li>
    <li> It is moisturizing but doesnt keep skin hydrated. My skin stays rough. I have acne prone skin but it doesnt break me out.</li>
    <li> It can be used all over your body. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy after. My hair has a nice touchable shine to it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to mix into a facial moisturizer, but have been using it straight. I like it very much!</li>
    <li> This oil is like gold for skin and hair.  Will be mixing with other essential oils for full benefits on hair.</li>
    <li> I am Not sure if it is what it says it is, but I am going to use it up.</li>
    <li> checklist of 7 warnings:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The ingredients list just said: 100% Argan Oil.  Check.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Nice dark amber glass bottle.  Check.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The price.  On the high end.  $58 (before tax) ( you can get under 2 ounces for $11.00)&lt;br /&gt;4.  The scent.  Zero.  It has obviously been deodorized.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The texture.  dry/light oiliness .&lt;br /&gt;6.  No sediment as far as we could see.  And the oil was crystal clear, not cloudy.&lt;br /&gt;7.  The results.  Unsure.  After failing tests 4, 5 and 6 we would be unwilling to buy this product again .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil should have a light to medium nutty or rubberband smell, light sediment, and silky.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! While this product is certainly argan oil its purity and clarity leaves a lot to desire. I compared it to organic argan oil bought in France. It is much darker (yellower) and has a grainy texture that suggests tiny particles are floating in the oil</li>
    <li> love this product  just as good as the more expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;great for hair and added to all other beauty products</li>
    <li> A very, very good value! But it smells sort-of stale (both bottles, as I ordered two of them), not the sweet-ish smell that fresh Argan Oil has. I&#x27;ll still use it, it still moisturizes like this kind of oil so wonderfully does... the smell is just less pleasant than what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Best value for pure argan oil on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased pure argan oil on Amazon from other sellers before and this stuff isn&#x27;t as good.  It&#x27;s lighter and more viscous and doesn&#x27;t have as much hold. I also wish it came in a different bottle that was easier to dispense from.  I decided to re-use the empty dispenser bottle from watt&#x27;s brand and filled it up with this stuff since the push dispenser makes it much easier to control how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s Ok for the price, but I&#x27;ll try looking for a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality and price of this oil. It has exceeded my expectations for the price.</li>
    <li> This is not real argan oil (doesn&#x27;t even smell like it) but good enough for me! it&#x27;s great for skin and hair</li>
    <li> This brand of Argan oil is much better then the overpriced model&#x27;s brand name argan oil sold on QVC.  It is lighter, absorbes more quickly, and you get 4 ounces for less then half the cost of the half-ounce size from the QVC rip-off brand.  I will never buy another brand of Argan oil.  Love it!!!!  If you are an Argan oil fanatic, stick with this brand.  It is worth every penny.  This bottle doesn&#x27;t come with a dropper, so be prepared to poor a an ounce or so into another container for easier usuage.  I just filled my QVC bottle with this oil so I can use the dropper.  I put this oil on my face, neck, hands and hair every day.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product.  I use this oil daily on my face.  I read that argan oil is a rejuvenator so I bought it to replace the pricey rejuvenating serum I had been using.  I&#x27;m 47 and fighting aging skin with all I&#x27;ve got!  This oil makes my skin look softer, and reduces the look of lines.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is not pure argan oil - going back to the product I usually order.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great oil very light weight love it to seal my hair.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping; love the oil - my complexion shows almost instant improvement.  Would definitely recommend this product - great for skin, hair conditioning - wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have replaced my facial moisturizers with a Argan oil and my skin has improved immensely!</li>
    <li> I was looking for another brand of Argan oil that was of good quality, affordable and big enough to meet my needs.  This brand fit all my requirements.  It is odorless and a little goes a long way.  I will purchase this product again.  It is packaged in a glass bottle and arrived without as much as a chip on the bottle.  If you are looking for Argan oil that is pure and reasonable, the brand is definitely one you should consider giving a try.</li>
    <li> Great for hair and skin.  I use this on my natural hair and on my daughter&#x27;s relaxed hair. Helps with shine.</li>
    <li> I use argan oil on my hair after washing, to protect it during blowdrying and other argan oil products I have used are quickly absorbed, leaving my hair light and shiny. This particular brand of argan oil is not absorbed at all and leaves my hair dirty and greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in addition to my leave in conditioner and I have great results...I love the way my hair looks and feels...</li>
    <li> I really would like to comment on this company Essential Depot.....They are excellent!! I have ordered a few products from them and am more than pleased. Their outter labelingis simple (as organics should be)so pricing is simple the attention is paid to the shipping. I made my own wrinkle treatment cream and hair conditioning treatments and my clients are begging me for more. Thank you Essential Depot. As I expand my buisness this will be a company of interest for me.</li>
    <li> One of the best Argan Oils in the market, if not the best!!! It has no smell and works great with my skin, hair and nails. I have very long hair, below my waist and I use a lot of Argan Oil. My hair never looked so good and soft....😊&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of compliments from friends and family that my face looks younger and that is good for a 68 year old person.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I use argan oil as my primary moisturizer and I used to pay $12+ for 1 oz. This product is such a steal! The same prize except 4x more. I don&#x27;t notice any difference in quality. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest argan oil but the quality is superior! I&#x27;ve ordered this a couple of times although I&#x27;ve noticed the price has gone up a dollar or two.</li>
    <li> but does what everyone says it will!  Not sure what you can mix it with depending on where you plan to use it, but the scent is not pleasant at all.</li>
    <li> Item was as described and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I used to use Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil for my mild acne (on asian skin), but it was hurting my wallet. I decided to give this brand a try.  I&#x27;ve been using this one for a week and I don&#x27;t see much of an improvement on my skin. It feels different from Josie Maran because this one has no scent at all and feels heavy on the face.  Josie Maran&#x27;s felt cold on the skin.  Is this even argan oil? The sticker label was put on very sloppily on my bottle. When I used Josie Maran&#x27;s at night, my skin actually looked brighter and glowed, felt softer, and acne problem improved when I woke up in the morning.  Essential Depot&#x27;s argan oil doesn&#x27;t work for me, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it a little longer and see.</li>
    <li> OMG wonderrful package great love it</li>
    <li> My hair loves this oil! Leave on overnight to improve your hair</li>
    <li> tried several kinds of argan oil. This one works best in my shampoo bars and beard oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this awesome oil about a month ago because I started doing my own skin care productos, kept it in a bathroom cabinet along other skin care products like glycerin, beeswax etc...the top its NOT child safe and I just happen to have a two years old little girl...yes! To what you&#x27;re thinking, everyone who has one of those cute things running around the house knows how impossible its to keep them out of everything! This afternoon she came out of the bathroom cover from head to toes in my argan oil!  Review: Essential Depot has really good products for your household needs, personally I don&#x27;t want to buy any more skin care products made with crisco,lye and sulfates so thanks to ESS I&#x27;m taking care of my family&#x27;s skin care needs, I&#x27;m learning and having fun in the process. Now....to order another bottle.</li>
    <li> I reccomend this product because of its quality and quantity. It is reasonably priced and performs well. I use it for skiin care and hair care and I love thee non greasy results.</li>
    <li> I use this on my skin each night. I also put it on my hair when it is damp. great for dry skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad for this product being available. I use it for my hair &amp; some skin use. It can really make some nice texture in hair. The price is fair, &amp; it arrives in the mail timely.  I am hoping it will stay available &amp; at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It feels so good on my skin and helps heal open wounds.  I can&#x27;t put it in my hair and go anywhere because it makes my hair look greesy but I put it in and leave it overnight and then wash it out in the morning and it does amazing things to my hair.  It makes my hair look more alive and shiny than it has ever looked.</li>
    <li> I discovered Argan Oil in Paris and fell in love.  I have never been able to find it in my local shops, so I ordered this and is it great.  I use it for moisturizing my face and body, removing eye make-up, a few drops in my baby&#x27;s bath... all sorts of things.  It absorbs beautifully and never causes break-outs.  Having a beauty product with one ingredient is pretty much as pure as you can get!</li>
    <li> It is a fraud, this product has no consistency, or the effect similar products, I do not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Argan oil from other vendors and this seems to be as good as any of my previous purchases.  Some have complained it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume like smell to it.  This is true, it has no fragrance so far as I can tell.  That doesn&#x27;t bother as I&#x27;m more worried about how it works not how it smells.  To that point it works well.  In other words, it moisturizes my hair without making it oily.  Price was good too so I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE PLUM FIRST AND ARGAN 2ND&lt;br /&gt;i love the fact that i have it with me always.  it&#x27;s like i am carrying the whole library with me. i am loving it...</li>
    <li> am evaluating effects.  good prompt service</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin oil. Leaves skin soft without being overly greasy.</li>
    <li> I use Argan oil on hair, face, body and Essential absorbs well,  but use it sparingly on hair.  I cannot tell this product from the more expensive ones.  Try it and save.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I purchased this, but I decided it&#x27;s worth a review. Consistency was good, Color was not amber, more clear, and smelled like mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could have been mineral oil. I ended up using the whole thing anyway. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
