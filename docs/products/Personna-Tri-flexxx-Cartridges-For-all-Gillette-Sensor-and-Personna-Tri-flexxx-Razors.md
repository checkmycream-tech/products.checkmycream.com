      <li>This is a Nice Product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a triple blade for the Sensor.</li>
      <li>While they give a good, close shave, they impart a bit more &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>These are a good deal, and they work OK, but they seem to clog up a bit.  </li>
      <li>Work just as good as the ones that are 5x more money.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;rugged &amp;#34; face or skin or have the kind of face that has &amp;#34;hard shadow&amp;#34; with a 24 hour period.</li>

      <li>Good Smooth Shave ...</li>
      <li>I can tell, because it smiled more.</li>
      <li>Best blades I have purchased and used so far</li>
      <li>While it might not be the best for the blades, shaving with conditioner instead of shaving cream makes my legs so soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>/&gt;These blades are great, I am 100% happy and do recommend them definitely.</li>
      <li>Either I got a miracle box that is awesome or the other people are paid good money by gilette to bomb this product</li>
      <li>I go two days without shaving and then shave, again, the Gillette blades win if I don&#x27;t shower first,</li>
      <li>Great product at a reasonable cost!</li>
      <li>Exceptionally fine blades for shaving!</li>
      <li>If you believe this is a great or good or even average blade for shaving, good for you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the blade was quite as sharp for the first shave but they last as long &amp; maybe longer.</li>
    <li> These blades shave just as well as the Gillette brand. I cannot believe how much the brand name manuf are ripping men off for blades. It is pure greed. I have tried the newer type razors but I guess I am not coordinated enough to use them and came back to my old stand by sensor stick.</li>
    <li> Some reviews imply these blades are not as sharp and don&#x27;t last as long. I haven&#x27;t noticed that much difference. For the price I will use them as long as they are available. They clog with whiskers some. But, a couple of swipes with a fingernail brush cleans it. The most important thing to make blades last longer is to dry them. Rub the dull end of the blades upward on a towel afterward and keeping them dry between shaving can add several shaves</li>
    <li> Got the 24 pack as an alternative to the expensive Gillette sensor blades.  You get the same or better shave at less than 1/2 the cost of Gillette blades.  As a side, I&#x27;ve tried Gillette Mach and Fusion and I still prefer the older sensor model.  The only discernable diffference I can surmise is the outrageous prices Gillette wants to charge for the other blades.</li>
    <li> Save yourself some money and buy a well-made American product the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very upset when Walmart stopped carrying these, but I guess that&#x27;s why we have the Internet. These perform as well as the Mach 3 razor&#x27;s that will cost you much more. The fact they&#x27;re made in America is just an extra bonus.</li>
    <li> I waited to write this until I had used the product a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s working great, so glad I found this.&lt;br /&gt;The savings will be massive, and it seems to work better than the 2 blade original version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I&#x27;ve never actually tried mach 3 or fusion, but have used sensor many years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I&#x27;ve now been using this 6 months.  It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m at a loss how anyone could rate this 1 star.  Either I got a miracle box that is awesome or the other people are paid good money by gilette to bomb this product LOL</li>
    <li> Great blades! I have a slow-growing beard so I tend to go a day or two between shaves, and these blades bring me back to a baby-smooth face every time. I shave against the grain of my beard and they don&#x27;t snag or pull until the blades are starting to get dull, which is typically after 10 or so shaves. At less than half the cost of Gillette replacement blades for my Sensor handle, these blades are a no-brainer!</li>
    <li> These are not great razors.  The Gillette brand is much better and easier on the skin.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the prompt and accurate shipment - I could no longer find these refills in my area.</li>
    <li> Impossible to find in stores. great buy!!</li>
    <li> The first appeal of these blades was the price, which is less than half of Gillette Sensor Excel blades.  However, the very pleasant surprise is that the quality is also excellent, frankly much better than Sensor Excel blades.</li>
    <li> Exceptionally fine blades for shaving! Best blades I have purchased and used so far and I recommend it highly. James H. Chan Ph.D.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Sensor has been around for a while now. I liked it when it came out, but when the Mach 3 arrived, I figured I&#x27;d give the new technology a shot. I hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went back to my old, reliable Sensor and have been a shaving Luddite ever since, ignoring all the new \\&quot;advances\\&quot; in technology--no vibrating, multi-colored plastic monstrosities that look like some kind of child&#x27;s toy for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But finding reasonably priced blades to fit the Sensor was a problem, until I ran across he Personna blades at a local grocery store a few years back. They fit my razor and cost less than the Gillette cartridges. But they vanished a few months ago. So I bought some of the regular Sensor cartridges again. What a disappointment! Only two blades, pricey, not nearly as close a shave, and they lasted 3-4 weeks at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was THRILLED to discover the Personna cartridges again on Amazon, and for even less than I&#x27;d been paying locally. These are excellent, long-lasting, three-blade cartridges that deliver a closer shave (for me, anyhow) than the regular two-blade Gillette product. And at this price, they&#x27;re a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other commenter said he was getting six months out of each cartridge--I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had quite that kind of longevity from them, but a couple of months (or more) of smooth shaves is easily in the ballpark. I figure one order of these should last me three or four YEARS. Shaving hasn&#x27;t been this cheap since I was 16, used a Gillette Adjustable 1-9 double-edged razor, and stole the blades from my dad!</li>
    <li> These cost way less than Mach 3, etc. They work fine. I have a tough beard, so I go through blades fairly fast. No way I&#x27;m paying $4-5 per blade. Please don&#x27;t stop making them!</li>
    <li> These blades are cheap, painful and will nick you frequently for EACH SHAVE.  They don&#x27;t compare with normal brand names. Finding a handle must be done online so prepare for that.  They also took forever to arrive.  This is easily the single worst internet purchase I have ever made.  Just burn your $37 (handle included).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve definitely used Personna razor cartridges in the past, because they&#x27;re notably cheaper than the brand-name ones, and that&#x27;s basically all I care about.  They worked flawlessly for me then, so when I found them here, it was an obvious purchase.  These, however, are really really awful.  Maybe there was some batch of terribly unsharp and poor quality blades that a handful of us here got... or maybe they&#x27;ve just started making these more cheaply than before.  All I know is that I&#x27;m still very confused, because I&#x27;ve never had such bad luck with these razors.  It&#x27;s probably still worth taking your chances and buying a smaller pack of these to see how yours turn out, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the 24 pack for now.</li>
    <li> I remember the name Personna from my teen years, but that was a long time ago.  I took a chance on these and am quite pleased.  The Personna blades cut cleaner than the Gillette Sensor blades I&#x27;ve been using and seem to hold up very well.  The Amazon price makes them a steal.</li>
    <li> Having used various razors (Gillette Mach 3/Turbo, Gillette Sensor/XL, Schick Hydro 3/5 and the Personna matrix) in the past 2-3 years in search of the perfect shave I must conclude that this is the worst by a long stretch, along with the Personna Matrix. I very rarey cut myself when shaving and cant remember the last time I cut myself more than twice. With this razor the shave started well but as soon as I got to underneath my chin it went downhill rapidly. I ended up with 6-8 (!) small cuts underneath my chin and it itched like crazy. I can see why the premimum razors cost more now. I would advise spending a little more and getting a decent well know, well built brand such as Schick or Gillette etc instead of cheap knock offs. This is in no way whatsoever a good substitute.</li>
    <li> I can only tell you that Personna Tri-Flexxx has worked on my face for well over 10 years.  For the past 2 years, I have also been shaving my head.  So long as I do not press down, both are smooth and bloodless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shave a different face or different head or ...?, then you may have different results.  The bad reviews that I see here are exactly what I would write for the other razors that I have tried.  My face was irritated by the highly-marketed 4 and 5 blade \\&quot;systems\\&quot;, and I had annoying in-grown hairs.  Upon returning to this cartridge, my face was happy again.  I can tell, because it smiled more.</li>
    <li> I want to preface my review by saying a little something about my face type,which few reviewers have addressed,but I feel is very important in regards to shaving results. I&#x27;m 48 years and have what most call &amp;#34;baby faced&amp;#34; skin...I.E. sensative skin. I also have what I would consider normal facial hair growth. I dont have to shave EVERYDAY but by the end of the day that I DIDN&#x27;T shave,I will start to get noticeable stubble. I don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;rugged &amp;#34; face or skin or have the kind of face that has &amp;#34;hard shadow&amp;#34; with a 24 hour period. I can grow a FULL beard...and have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now,with that said, these blades are actually very good. I find them even better than the original Sensor Excel blades. I have used one blade for exactly a month (10 uses,roughly 3 times a week, no weekends) . The Personna is still sharp and has had minimal dullness. The lubricating stripes aren&#x27;t dry yet and here&#x27;s the important part: I have yet to get a skin rash or burns and  get minimal cuts,even in my most sensative areas (below my jawbone ,lower mustache area and under my nose). It&#x27;s also very good at getting tight areas,considering the triple blades and detail work (trimming my sideburns and hairline on the back of my neck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well all know,the cost of blades in stores is RIDICULOUSLY expensive,which I find incredibly ironic, as I DESPISE shaving...if it were up to me,I&#x27;d have a Will Arnett,&amp;#34; LAST MAN ON EARTH&amp;#34; beard. But the low cost,great shave and durability has got me more than sold on this blade. I bought a year&#x27;s worth. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND you do the same! You won&#x27;t regret it.....and think of the money you&#x27;ll save!</li>
    <li> Another case of a quality product not getting distribution. Perhaps that big razor blade company you&#x27;ve definitely heard of controls retail stores.... this brand was in Costco, then dropped from there. Great that I can get these blades through Amazon!</li>
    <li> The blades work fine, and are SUBSTANCIALLY cheaper than the Sensor/Gillette brand.  Thanks for offering an alternative to the brand name options.</li>
    <li> These blade refills work pretty darn well for the price. They are not quite as good as the Gillettes,but at almost 1/2 the price they are well worth it.</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase of Personna Tri-flexx cartridges.  I think these are a good sharp blade that gives a close comfortable shave. The only downside to the blade is length of service.  I have found that they seem to last about 25% less than the Gillette Sensor Excel blade. Since the price was about 33% less than the Gillete blade, I feel I still got a good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Sensor razor for years and was disappointed when Costco stopped selling their blades. I found the Personna replacements on Amazon and decided to try them as the price was much cheaper than the Gillettes anywhere else. I was majorly surprised to find out that the Personnas were TRIPLE blades, not doubles like the Gillettes. They cut so smooth and close, much nicer than the Gillettes. I use a ladies Gillette razor, as they are a wide flat handle instead of the standard thin stem. I shave my head daily as well as my beard, so the ladies razor has much more stability and control. I&#x27;ve cut myself much less with it. With these Personna blades cutting should be virtually eliminated!</li>
    <li> As good as the more well known brands and equally long lasting at a much better price.</li>
    <li> Great razor blades for so much less than store bought.  Husband says they keep his face just as smooth and too!  A+++++</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not bad for the price, but the shave can&#x27;t compare to more expensive name-brand blade replacements. I find these nick me all over my face even at the first use. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for the past three years, ever since I found them on Amazon.  They are at least as good, if not better, than the Sensor blades that are way more expensive.</li>
    <li> Are better than Gillette&#x27;s. Tried other &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors, but none work as well.at</li>
    <li> Came Fast ... Does Fit My Gillette Sensor &amp; Has One More Blade Than My Sensor Blades Did ... Good Smooth Shave ...</li>
    <li> Used to get these at small mart but now they only sell the expensive dual blades. These are tri blades and one blade will last 6 months. Unless the wife gets hold of it.</li>
    <li> Purchase these razors for my husband and he said they were very good! These substitute razors are a good value and good quality too!  Would definitely recommend them..</li>
    <li> I really love these blades. They give you a real nice shave. Cheap and just as good as your well known brands. Started using these blades because this company doesn&#x27;t test on animals. Highly recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> Walmart used to carry these but no longer do. I was very happy to find this product on here as they preform great at a fraction of the cost of OEM blades.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical, but thought it was worth giving these a try.  My usual blades are Gillette Sensor (twin blade with lube and rubberized strip) - which cost much more than the Tri-Felxxx.    Upon using the Tri-Flexx, it seems they give a better shave! Who would have thought?!    I do have quite the shaving regimen(due to very thick/coarse facial hair) - so now soften hairs in the shower, use a pre-shave oil base and high quality Itlalian cream (Proraso) over the oil applied with a boar-hair bristled brush.    Using the new blades with the above regimen required a slight change (for the better) in how I shave - use a lighter touch, which means less nicks and razor burn too.    Recommended!</li>
    <li> I simply don&#x27;t understand how I can have such a grave difference in experiences to those that think these blades are \\&quot;as good as or BETTER than &#x27;THAT&#x27; brand razor\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I really, truly tried to like these blades.  I wanted to have something other than the GIANT&#x27;s blade as an option, since I feel they&#x27;re just bleeding us dry with the prices they charge for their line-up of various blades and shaving gear.&lt;br /&gt;The major points I read in reviews prior to my purchase were:&lt;br /&gt;1) Made in America.  (that&#x27;s a rare commodity nowadays)&lt;br /&gt;2) Equal or better in one&#x27;s shaving experience&lt;br /&gt;3) Longevity.  MONTHS on a blade?  amazing.&lt;br /&gt;4) Price.  Well, truthfully, even if they were the same price but provided similar comfort and lasted even twice as long as \\&quot;Goliath&#x27;s\\&quot; blades, I would in theory, cut my shaving costs for razors in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) yes, the package says they&#x27;re made right here in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;2) First blade pulled my beard from the first shave on.  After several shaves the \\&quot;glide bar\\&quot; lubricant began to break-up worse than a hyper-speed transport entering the atmosphere at the wrong trajectory.&lt;br /&gt;The second and third blades?  repeat exactly what I said for the first blade.  Sadly, it was no fluke.&lt;br /&gt;I will use them up.  It shouldn&#x27;t take long, cause I&#x27;ve never had a single blade that lasted NEAR a month.  I MAY get a couple shaves more out of a blade than my previous Excels.  But the trade-off of having a torn-up face compared to the MUCH smoother shave experienced with it&#x27;s major competition simply isn&#x27;t one I&#x27;m willing to try again.&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY wanted to find a blade that would cause Gillette to reconsider their pricing for their products.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I simply don&#x27;t think that right now they have any quality competition out there.&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;ORIGINAL POST&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I like the idea they&#x27;re made in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t praise the \\&quot;glide\\&quot; and the cutting edge.  This first blade tends to \\&quot;pull\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It does cut and hasn&#x27;t caused ingrown hairs, however the blade head tugs while I shave both my face and my head (I am bald by choice)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this point in time I can&#x27;t speak of the longevity of the blades as right now the blade hasn&#x27;t been in there any longer than what my Excel II blades were before needing replacement.  If they last as long as others have mentioned in their reviews, I can deal with the extra effort in shaving daily.&lt;br /&gt;So, in my case, the jury is still out.  Is this just a sub-par first blade? I don&#x27;t know until I get further in the pack of blades.  I will certainly use them, as they don&#x27;t nick me as another reviewer reported.  But in all honesty, I will probably go back to the Excel&#x27;s unless these last as long as other reviewers claim.ll\\&quot;.

    <li> Great value, These cartridges are hard to find.</li>
    <li> these are the best razors. I have now loaded up on them enough for a year. a fraction of what other blades cost and they last longer.</li>
    <li> These are a good value, however out of the box, I find them NOT as sharp as the name brand blades, even on the first shave. When I run out my batch of 24, I&#x27;m just going to buy the name brand ones, since the price difference has narrowed.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older my skin is more sensitive and I was dissapointed that I could only get a week or so out of the Gillette cartridges before major blood loss from shaving.On my first shave with the Personna cartridges I cut myself several times and it has gotten worse with each shave so far. I am still on my first cartridge so there may be a learning curve that I have not completed yet. I have several more cartridges to use so hopefully I will get used to these before I need to visit the blood bank. If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> While the price of this item seemed competitive by far, the quality makes it not worth it.  Not only are the blades dull, but it takes three blades to the one of the name brand.  I was using it in place of the Sensor Excel.  I went out and paid top dollar for new blades even though I still have two packs left of this generic brand.  Sad waste of money.  Sometimes you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is cheaper than the cartridges from Gillette. The cartridge last as long as the Gillette Sensor. Gillette Sensor 20 Ct. for $38.64 and not a Prime item. 24 Personna Tri-flexxx Cartridges for $25.77 a Prime item. Two day Shipping, or pay more and get it in a week. Pay $1.93 for each cartridges and wait a week, or pay $1.07 a cartridges with two day shipping. Also 2 blade Gillette, or get 3 blades, with Personna.</li>
    <li> A close shave at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> In my book these blades are superior to the blades sold for my big brand razor.  I&#x27;m glad I found a source since my local stores no longer carry them.  Why pay more for a big name when these are better blades?</li>
    <li> These will last a while if taken care of. If you haven&#x27;t tried using a shaving brush, that will help, shaving creams and lotions are garbage, I used them for years. The longer you brush your face the smoother the shave, any brush over $35 is too much. I don&#x27;t use shaving soap, just South of France shower soap with a decent brush. Dry the blades after use and keep them in a dry place, not in the shower. Search online for ways to make blades last. One 3-pack of these lasts me more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a decent brush that looks just like one I&#x27;ve used for years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0064AEHL8 Vulfix 1000A Pure Badger Shaving Brush, Imitation Ebony with Drip Stand, Black]]</li>
    <li> Quality, American made blades fit my Sensor razor at a lower cost than the equivalent blades from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I am posting this because I am bothered by some of the ridiculous negative reviews here. No, these blades do not cut your face any more than any other blade. No, the blades do not rust in normal use. No, the Personna blades don&#x27;t wear out faster than comparable Gillette blades -- I checked. I&#x27;m on my third set (3 sets of 24 cartridges) of these Tri-flexxx blades and have been very happy with them. They provide an excellent shave, they are easy to clean, they last long enough, and the price is right. I&#x27;m planning to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to webmaster: I am posting this review on September 17, 2013. Amazon erroneously dates the review as being posted on April 11, 2011. After it happened the first time I deleted the review and reposted it from a different computer, but the date error recurred. I contacted Amazon about this error and received no response.</li>
    <li> These are good blades which fit the Gillette Sensor-type razor handles, and are available at a very good price of about $1/cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have commented that Gillette uses their best manufacturing technology to make the sharpest blades for their newest and most expensive razors.  There might be some truth to this - when my Sensor was the newest and greatest technology available, I remember being amazed at how sharp and long-lasting the blades were.  Brand-new sensor blades today, however, seem less sharp than, for example, brand new Fusion pro-glide blades.  Maybe this is a sign of technology advancing and changing our perceptions, or maybe it&#x27;s Gillette working to get people to buy the newer and more expensive blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades, however, are great.  They&#x27;re sharp, and last a reasonably long time.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, giving new life to my old Sensor razor handle.  It would make even more sense for someone who has an expensive metal Sensor handle, such as a quality Merkur or other product.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of these blades for my old razor. They are great but seem to dull quickly after a few uses which I guess is normal for this type of blade. It is hard to find blades to fit the old Sensor razors and these are good for the price.</li>
    <li> These blades fit the handle perfectly and shave nearly as smoothly as the originals. I say nearly because I had used my last OEM blade for so long, it&#x27;s shave was so rough, that I forgot what a new OEM blade shaved like.  These are excellent replacements for the money and I hope they remain available in the future.  It&#x27;s just too expensive to buy the latest handle and blades from the OEM.</li>
    <li> Hard to find blades just my fav!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried store brand blades before, and they&#x27;ve all been pretty average to bad from the first shave. This one felt just like using a Gillette blade to me. No nicks, smooth cut, close cut. And a hell of a lot cheaper than buying name brand. I&#x27;m sold on this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve mostly found non-Gillette replacements to be noticeably rougher than OEM, but these seem to be as smooth the originals.</li>
    <li> Package arrived in a timely manner. This type of blade I have used for years. They give me a complete and comfortable shave, and one blade can last me for up to 10 days. I see no purpose for more than a triple head blade. Shick sensor blades fit my shaver handle, but these do a better job.</li>
    <li> Initially, I thought that these were going to be an utter failure. It took me about three times as long to get a mediocre shave as it did to get a good one with the two-blade Gillette Sensor Excel cartridges. I didn&#x27;t really understand why people were complaining about cutting themselves like they&#x27;d just walked into a glass-shard-filled tornado, because I couldn&#x27;t get the damn things to cut much of anything. Then I compared an old Gillette cartridge and one of these side by side, and noticed that the Personna blades are actually recessed slightly deeper. So despite my misgivings, I simply mashed the razor into my face harder than I would dare with the Gillettes, and lo and behold, I got a pretty good shave. My face is quite smooth, but I can see how if you had moles or irregularities on your face, this might be a dangerous proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, not an instantly satisfying replacement, but ultimately worthwhile... for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor cartridge because of the high prices of Gillette sensor razor cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;I got a great deal but equally important I got a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;When I used the Gillette cartridge I always used a second razor to shave&lt;br /&gt; the whiskers under my nose on my upper lip. I discovered that the Personna&lt;br /&gt; has a narrower bracket on each end of the cartridge holding the blades.&lt;br /&gt;That permits me to get a closer shave on my upper lip just under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Now I no longer need a second razor to do the cleanup so I saved again in a&lt;br /&gt;way I never expected.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the bracket holding the Gillette blades in their cartridge I&lt;br /&gt;now noticed there was a wider bracket and I think this was why I never got an&lt;br /&gt;effective shave on my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;WaLa, I&#x27;m not going back to Gillette after I finish my current Gillette cartridges.</li>
    <li> Got these for my Headblade replacements and they work Great! Great value and get the job done shaving the melon. Im glad I found these, read the great reviews instead of over paying for Gillett&#x27;s...You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these at the local stores and my husband has had the same razor &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; for 15 years!! So glad to have found them online for a great price. Shipping was great. Product just as expected. I am a happy customer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a Nice Product. This product is, as described in adv and does as it is said in adv.</li>
    <li> Maybe the Personna Tri-flexxx was great in the past, but razor cartridges I bought recently nick my skin.  When I went back to the Gillette Sensor Excel, no nicking/pain.  Bad assembly? - blades out of alignment? Old worn-out blade sharpening equipment at the factory?  Counterfeit blades? I really wanted to like the Personnas, I hoped to have another cheaper source of good razor blades, oh well back to Sensor excels.</li>
    <li> Decent blades. Cheap price.</li>
    <li> Decided to give these a try as a way to save a few dillards over using Gillette blades. I&#x27;m happy with how they perform and will continue to use them</li>
    <li> THESE BLADES WORK GREAT AND ARE A HUGE SAVING OVER THE STANDARD GILETTE DISPOSABLE BLADES.  I WILL HAVE BLADES FO A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews prior to purchasing, but they were mixed so I decided to take the plunge.  After having one accumulate rust after a single use, then others get dull after 2 or 3, needless to say I&#x27;ve gone through one of the 3 boxes that came with this order.  I also have small cuts all over my legs and pits after shaving.  When I run out of all of these, which, given the summer and the frequency I have to shave, I expect to buy new Gillette brand Sensor cartridges by the end of July.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan.</li>
    <li> Not sure of the effectiveness of Testosterone Booster.  HP makes good quality products. Blades are blades. Last average length of time</li>
    <li> Blades work great. Can&#x27;t find them at any drug store chain. I don&#x27;t know if you get any more shaves than brand name blades but these work for me.Would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with these.  I find they are a great value and give me a shave as good as the name brands.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate.  These are just as good as the originals for way way way less.  Buy now, Shave now !</li>
    <li> I used to buy Personna Tri-flexxx blades at my local Walmart, but they no longer carry them.  This was a great alternative to keep my Sensor razor going without buying the expensive Gillette cartrges</li>
    <li> The blades work well and using them everyday, plus the remain sharp for a few cuts more weekly. Would purchase them again next time I need more.</li>
    <li> I have a Headblade razor that takes Sensor blades, which are not only hard to find, but a rip-off/ridiculously expensive.  These are a reasonable alternative -- I&#x27;ve used the first one for about two weeks, and it seems to have kept its edge.</li>
    <li> After a week of use, these Personna blades seem to be holding up week.  And, even if you only get half the shaves from each blade, at a quarter of the cost of name brand blades, they are a good deal.</li>
    <li> I like the sensor  type razor and these blades do the job better than the original blades from Gillette blades.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, work great, good price.  Not sure why others report a reduced life compared to the name brand, I&#x27;ve had no problem.  Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> You know the old scam:  Give away the razors, and then sell the blades at usurious prices.  With the latest Gillette Fusion blades going for a ridiculous 3 bucks (or more) apiece, and the older Sensor blades no longer being sold at Walgreen&#x27;s or at local grocery stores, I was pleased to discover these Personna blades on Amazon.  I can&#x27;t say whether they are as good as Gillette Sensor blades, which I haven&#x27;t used for a very long time; however, they certainly hold their own against other third-party blades that I&#x27;ve used in recent years.  At less than one dollar apiece, they offer a reasonably cost-effective way of saving a Sensor razor from oblivion.  I have two Sensors, which don&#x27;t show any signs of wearing out, so I hope to keep them going indefinitely with these Personna blades.  Come to think of it, I should probably order another set before they disappear from the market.</li>
    <li> Gillette Sensor razors have not been manufactured for some years and the double edged blades made by Personna  have been discontinued and no longer available from normal outlets.  Ordered these triple blades by Personna  expecting them to fit a Sensor razor.  Have 24 blade package.  Blades fall off the handle of the razor.  Do not fit as expected when ordering  Oh well......maybe its time to join the 21st Century and  buy an updated razor..</li>
    <li> They fit my razor &amp; work fine.</li>
    <li> excellent razors..as good or better than bigger brand razors at far less cost.. and fit my sensor perfectly</li>
    <li> These are just as good as the overpriced crap that Gillette and shick sell.  But, a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking to find a replacement for my Sensor Excel blades, which were just too expensive since Costco stopped carrying them. My options were limited given the 4/5 blade systems give me terrible shaving rash and the cheaper disposables have a tendency to cut me. I bought the Tri-Flexxx based on other reviews. I get a decent shave and no rash. There are some areas where I have to go over for a second time, but that is a common issue for all blades with me. My one shaving cream does seem to block the blades but I switched to another and that removed that problem.</li>
    <li> My husband bought these because the reviews said they worked just as good as Gillette Sensor ones.  They do not.  Unfortunately he now has 24 blades to use.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t go through blades that often.  Maybe one every three weeks.  About a month ago I checked my grocery store shaving section for branded cartridges, and I couldn&#x27;t believe what they wanted for them.  Absurd.  I found these Personnas here on Amazon and figured I&#x27;d give them a shot.  I&#x27;m glad I went for them.  They work great (shave extremely close) and seem to last as long as the branded cartridges -- maybe even slightly longer.  I had to fiddle with the cartridge to get it to seat properly, but that could be because the handle I have is ancient and its springs have probably weakened over the years.  I soaked it and flushed it out, and that made it a little easer to get the cartridge to stay on.  Once the cartridge is on, though, it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy more once this supply starts getting low.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a super-thick beard or sensitive skin. As such, these are great for me, especially because they&#x27;re so much less expensive than the name brand. They fit my razor handle and provide an excellent shave. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Tried these based on a couple reviews. They are definitely better than the Gillette two bladed ones for the same version of handle. One other nice thing, unlike the 4-5 blade cartridges you can actually rinse out the gunk between the blades. Usually can get 8-10 shaves out of each one, and that includes head and face!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Can&#x27;t hardly find in stores anymore. I like my Sensor and am well stocked for awhile now.</li>
    <li> I have only used one so far, but I&#x27;m pleased with the comfort of the shave, and the price is satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Work well, and for the price difference, they&#x27;re great!  I used to use Mach 3s, which I still think I slightly better, but for the price, there is no comparison.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on price versus Gillette Sensor blades. The order was filled quickly and arrived well,packaged.  While they give a good, close shave, they impart a bit more &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34;. Not enough to hinder performance or feel uncomfortable, actually hardly worth mentioning, just something I detect when shaving.  All-in-all a very good product.</li>
    <li> Well, I waited several months to write a review and give this an actual chance.  Overall, I give these 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave about once a week to every 10 days (hey, I&#x27;m a lazy guy) - usually when my beard starts itching to the point I can no longer stand it.  On occasion, I shave more frequently if there&#x27;s something important going on.  To tell you how long I go between shaves, and how long I use a blade, I&#x27;ve had these for several months now, and I just started my 2nd blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I haven&#x27;t shaved for a week, these blades tend to clog up more than my normal Gillette blades.  If shave before showering, these feel like they&#x27;re ripping the hairs out, rather than cutting them.  If I shower first, I get a nice, comfortable shave.  I actually did side-by-side comparisons between this blade and my last Gillette blade (both new) - I would do half my face with each one.  The Gillette gave a much nicer shave if I shave before I shower.  If I shave after I&#x27;ve showered, the results and feeling aren&#x27;t much different.  I do spend more time cleaning these blades than I do the Gillette ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I go two days without shaving and then shave, again, the Gillette blades win if I don&#x27;t shower first, and it&#x27;s even if I shower first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the longevity of the blade goes, that goes to the Gillette bladed, but only because I think they&#x27;re sharper to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the money, they&#x27;re a great value, and work well enough once I learned their limitations (I always shower before shaving with these blades).  Even if I go through these blades twice as fast as Gillette ones, they&#x27;re still about 30% cheaper....</li>
    <li> Fits Sensor Excel handle. Works well for me, 3 times a week for 2 weeks per cartridge. Smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Hello Personna goodbye cheap cartridges!  I am very pleased with this product. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Nice to use a blade that works well and is still at a responsible price. There smaller than the triple and quadruple blades, much easier to get the tight spots like under your nose</li>
    <li> I had originally reviewed these cartridges right after first using them.  They seemed okay.  They provided a smooth shave and somewhat comfortable shave, so I originally gave them a good rating.  After using them a few more times, I have to change my review.  First, at least for me, they clog easily.  Shaving cream and hairs get stuck in between the blades, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to remove.  I had to discard a couple of the cartridges just because I couldn&#x27;t use them from the clogged stuff. Second, to get a close shave it requires multiple passes of the blade.  At first, I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to it, because, like I mentioned, the shave was comfortable.  The problem showed itself a couple days later though when I started getting a lot of tiny razor bumps.  I have always been very susceptible to razor bumps, so in fairness it could just be me.  I am really disappointed that these blades didn&#x27;t work well for me.  There are so many positive reviews that I took a chance.  And, they are offered at a great price.  But, I&#x27;ll have to go back to the more expensive sensor excel blades for now.</li>
    <li> This replacement for Gillette is a great value. It works as good and will get you same number of the shaves(with almost the same quality) .</li>
    <li> These blades fit my Sensor Excel handle and shave just fine, though I don&#x27;t seem to get quite as many shaves per blade as I do with the Gillette blades.  But these are so much cheaper, it&#x27;s a worthwhile tradeoff.  Recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> Product I have been using for years and provides me with a close comfortable shave.  I enjoy using this product.</li>
    <li> I got an 8 pack to see how they stood up, and they work just fine, so I bought this 3 pack of 8.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, I&#x27;d say average. And my guess is that there will be a few blades that don&#x27;t match up in quality here and there because that&#x27;s usually what you get with the knock offs, but as long as that rate stays low, the cost is well worth it compared to the real thing from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I have been using those persnna blades for years and always got them from Wal Mart but all of a sudden they stopped selling them in their stores.  I found them on your sight so I ordered them from you.  I herb usually has them and they are a little less expensive than you.fd$7.45 for eight and free shipping always.</li>
    <li> Same quality but inexpensive compared to the name brand cartridges.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years now and even though I shave my face and head they hold up well.</li>
    <li> These do not fit the products they claim to fit! I have the sensor excel and they DO NOT attach to it!</li>
    <li> Cheap!  Work as well as OEM.</li>
    <li> I had used these for years with great results. However, the latest badge I bought (March 2014) features a new design that is terrible. I compared the razors and they are different. In fact, the new razors are different than the picture in the Persona package (look for the grooves in the plastic). Dissapointed and wont buy again.</li>
    <li> Work like the original and cheap.  No complaints. I have ordered several times and will continue.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these for years for my Sensor razor and they work fine for 1/3 the price.  Save yourself some dough and give these a try.</li>
    <li> I like these blades.  Had used Gillette Sensors for the last 20 years or so.  Was fishing around ebay and amazon for replacement cartridges - and recently they have become less common and more expensive.  I happened upon this tri cartridge and tried them, based on favorable reviews.  I actually get a closer shave than with the duo bladed &amp;#34;Excel&amp;#34;.  Not sure the the exact reason, but I speculate it&#x27;s the narrower space between blades.  Blade life seems OK, although I have not done any tracking of same.  I did switch back to a Sensor Excel cartridge for comparisons sake, and I do prefer the Personna Tri-flexxx.</li>
    <li> These cartridges make it possible to use my sensor razor.  Great product at a reasonable cost!</li>
    <li> Purchased due to the cost of the Gillette razors.&lt;br /&gt;Two biggest issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do not offer as close of a shave as the Gillette blades, and are not as easy to keep clean.  I have always shaved a second time against the grain to get a really smooth feel.  With these cartridges the initial shave seemed to do just as well as the Gillettes; however, when shaving against the grain to try and get that perfectly smooth feel the blades just can not catch the hair and feel like they are doing nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The space between the blades kept filling with hair and I could not rinse the hair out.  Ended up using a pair of tweezers to clean between the blades while shaving.  The Gillette cartridges are easy to just rinse out from the back and the hair rinses away.  Seems like these are just not quite as well designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Cost.&lt;br /&gt;  First pass seems to be comparable to Gillette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  A bit more grabby, they seem to grab and pull the hairs more often then Gillette&lt;br /&gt;  Will not shave close when shaving against the grain&lt;br /&gt;  Hard to clean while shaving; running water through back of the cartridge will not keep it clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges due work in the Sensor Excel.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a more cost effective alternative to the Mach 3 Turbo razors that I have been using.  I would consider myself a heavy user, since I shave my face, neck, and head.  These certainly do not work for me.  They clog up quickly and the blades are spaced too close together to rinse them out.  I am not happy with them at all, and disappointed that I wasted the money.</li>
    <li> Came as expected.  Fits Sensor handle just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three blades, lotion strip, made in USA, seems like solid craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First shave was closer than the first shaves with Sensor and Sensor Excel cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how long they last.</li>
    <li> The anwser is, \\&quot;NO\\&quot;! These blades do not compare in any way to the shave one gets with Sensor3 blades by Gillette. This in no way comes close to a replacement blade for sensor3, it fails at trying. If you want to waste your money and give it a try go right ahead. While Ive been known to waste money every now and then this was my best work. These blades seem to scratch/nick or have have ruff grooves, not a smooth shave at all. If you believe this is a great or good or even average blade for shaving, good for you. I understand nothing made is going to achieve great results for everyone but this simply fails \\&quot;the shave test\\&quot; in every way in my opinion. By far my worse shaves ever, the worst blades ever.</li>
    <li> Very effective and comfortable razor. I easily get a month of use from each one. The price makes this is terrific value.</li>
    <li> Maybe not the highest quality, but suitable for my light beard</li>
    <li> Works perfectly as replacement cartridge for the eco-friendly but way overpriced Preserve razors.  As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s the exact same cartridge.</li>
    <li> fit perfect on my old favorite sensor excel razor handle, these have the  three blades for a even close and smooth shave,better than the old 2 blade I used to buy.</li>
    <li> In an attempt to reduce my shaving costs, I bought a Personna handle and a set of cartridges last December. The cost per cartridge was about a dollar, significantly less than two or three dollars for name brands from Gillette or Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big mistake. I get less than half the number of shaves per cartridge than my Schick Quattro and the amount of nicks, cuts and post shave burning is significantly higher.</li>
    <li> These are great blades and long lasting. It&#x27;s nice to have a triple blade for the Sensor.</li>
    <li> These blades are great. They are triple bladed and fit my Sensor Excell perfectly. I used to buy Sensor blades at Costco but they no longer carry them. So I tried the bigger multi-blade razors but found them to be too big, like having a 2X4 on the end of a pencil. They were also expensive!  Then I found these blades at Amazon. They are cheaper, shave better (3 blades) than the original Gillette ones and they seem to give as many or more shaves. A very good buy for me.</li>
    <li> These seem to be OK and definitely less than the originals.</li>
    <li> I am the last person to buy a brand for the sake of buying a brand, but do not buy these in place of sensor excel.  They are not even close to as good.</li>
    <li> Excellent. They work as advertised.</li>
    <li> good low cost no frills blades -</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to understand why Gillette has such a stranglehold on the US market (think monopoly), when Personna has a much better razor, and it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
    <li> These are great, cheap replacement blades. Price is fantastic, and in my experience the quality was just as good as the name brand.</li>
    <li> I needed to restock blades for my Sensor, and find it difficult to find them. These seem to fill the bill, and at a fair price. I hope they keep making them available.</li>
    <li> I came from the Bic Tracer or Sensor, and I just got tired of the price of those so I gave these a shot.  I use these more for touch up after my normal wet-dry electric, but I have sensitive skin and have never had any trouble or irritation from these.  I don&#x27;t notice a difference from the OEM brands and much better price obviously.</li>
    <li> Long time user of the Sensor razor....just hate the high prices for the Gillette razor refills. Just discovered the Personna razor refills. AND THEY WORK GREAT!! They are just as good, if not better, than the higher priced Gillette counterparts. I will never pay the higher price again....buying my razor refills from Personna off Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to compare against the name brand.  I did not get nearly as close a shave as with the name brand.  I will be returning them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Gillette Sensor razor for years with the only downside being the cost of replacement blades and the fact that they quickly clog up with bits of hair no matter how well you rinse them.&lt;br /&gt;These blades seem sharper, give a closer shave, and resist clogging better than the Gillettes do.</li>
    <li> Very nice blades at a great set of razor blades. Quick shipping. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought a Personna shaver (men&#x27;s) a while back and really liked it.  One blade refill lasts me about two or three weeks, so I can&#x27;t complain.  Plus these are a great price!</li>
    <li> I had always used the gillete sensor. I saw these and thought that the price was good enough to try. Glad I did. They work great.</li>
    <li> Not the best blades in the world but good enough for this face and a much better value than the name brands.</li>
    <li> Work just as good as the ones that are 5x more money. They no longer carry these in store, and can&#x27;t beat price.</li>
    <li> These blades, which work with the Sensor excel handle, are excellent. They are a lot less expensive than the sensor excel blades and they also have 3 blades instead of 2. My facial hair grows in &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; and these blades hold up well.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy. My husband uses this product and to find it in such quantity was a bonus. The packaging was great and he is so pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> so nice not to have him run out of razors..he gives this set a thumbs up..he hightly recomends them for use</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. These Tri-flex blades are dull and don&#x27;t last long. Go for the Gillette instead.</li>
    <li> Having not purchased razor blades in a long time I was surprised at how much they were at the store so I stocked up on these and they are identical to the ones that cost almost twice as much over the counter.</li>
    <li> Great deal, but the razors wear out fast.</li>
    <li> These came in very quick and undamaged. These work great just like the brand name but for a lot less. I recommend these to anyone who has a Gillette Sensor. So why pay more.</li>
    <li> Wow, I read many reviews about these MADE IN USA blades; some were good and some were bad. Several said they ended up with cuts and scrapes, although I don&#x27;t know why, I had none of these issues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so stoked to find these blades. I hated it when Costco stopped selling the OE blades for my Sensor so I started buying the disposable ones which sucked. I&#x27;ll be darned if I&#x27;m going to pay for 4-5 new style blades that feel totally foreign in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are great, I am 100% happy and do recommend them definitely. Thanks Amazon for selling them!</li>
    <li> Have only used one since buying this many months ago.  Used the same blade for many shaves already then started my winter beard.  Works fine but not as good as some other blades I&#x27;ve had.  These should last for many years.</li>
    <li> It does fit the Sensor shaver, but it&#x27;s not as accurate a shave as the original 2 blade. It has a tendency to \\&quot;glide\\&quot; without cutting and it&#x27;s difficult to cut in smaller areas of your face.</li>
    <li> Use to buy from Walmart and they are designed different now. (Sure seems that way)&lt;br /&gt;  Blade seems narrow and shave just not the same.  Decent but not as I remember.  Will not buy again.  If they were $15 would consider but at this price will wait for coupons and buy Sensor brand.</li>
    <li> And just as good.  If you like wasting money, give it to Gillette.  Otherwise, buy these.  Just as good. Period.</li>
    <li> Blade is on the \\&quot;dull\\&quot; side. I have to do 3 to 4 passes before whiskers are shaved off. I got a huge cut on my chin using this blade. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful to find a good replacement for my Excel Sensor II blades.  Sadly, these do not fit the bil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do not cut the hair that you are trying to shave as much as they scrape off the skin that hold the hair!  They hurt and they need to be replaced very often.  I will not be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for replacement blades for the Preserve Brand razors my husband and I both use for a price I could stomach. This fit the bill and look *exactly* like the blades that come when you order them directly from Preserve. Hooray!</li>
    <li> No comparison to the major brand.  It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve barely shaved.  Tried to save money, but if they don&#x27;t work, what&#x27;s the sense?</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t ask for a better razor, for the price! Just keep it dry after use and it will last for weeks, thanks</li>
    <li> not quite as good as gillette, admittedly, but definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> I bought them for my friends, they love them.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as an economical alternative to the Gillette Sensor blades.  I have found that they are hard to rinse out and as a result clog up easily.  I also feel that they do not remain sharp for as long.  Unfortunately I now have 24 blades to use, though I am going through them quite quickly due to their less than Gillette brand quality.</li>
    <li> this is first trial for me and i found this product is way better than &#x27;GILLETTE&#x27; product.i have tell my relative and he also have same experience.go for it.</li>
    <li> Great bargain and works well</li>
    <li> This product performs as well as the name brand blades. The price was too good to pass up. Will definitely purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they are significantly less expensive than gillette sensor sensitive…WHOA. They tore up my legs. Dulled after one use. Terrible.</li>
    <li> Hurt my smooth face. I learned that I should buy more expensive razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prep my face pretty well. Use hot water and good cream.</li>
    <li> These blades are a good value. They&#x27;re not quite of the same quality as the brand-name blades, but they&#x27;re very close and the price is so much lower that there&#x27;s no contest.</li>
    <li> These are a good deal, and they work OK, but they seem to clog up a bit.  I still like 2 blade refills better than 3.</li>
    <li> this blade fits in my sensor razor but doesn&#x27;t quite measure up for some reason--since I don&#x27;t have any excel blades left I can&#x27;t compare to see why.  the shave is definitely not at as close, but it gives an okay job.</li>
    <li> Save yourself some real money and get a quality product.  Having used the sensor blades and paid retail for them gave me the reason to try these, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  They work as well as the original and the price is much less, quite a savings indeed.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I suppose the cartridges work very well, but they do not fit my razor. In all honesty, I should not rate this article as I was not able to use it.</li>
    <li> These fit perfect and were direct replacements at a fraction of the cost of originals. These are a must purchase.</li>
    <li> When Gillette Sensor stopped supplying replacement cartridges (at a reasonable consumer cost), these Personna replacements came to the rescue.  It was a bit of a gamble, as not all reviews were positive, but I remember the brand name from long ago.  The batch I received provide a close shave and the blades seem to last well between cartridge changes.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic replacement for the Gillette Sensor Blade. Really close shave. Three blades rather than 2 really do make a difference.</li>
    <li> The Personna blades give a good close shave, are very durable, and I get to keep using my favorite \\&quot;sensor&#x27; razor.  In the past, I have found Personna razor blades to be of a higher quality than others, and these tri-flexx blades continue to meet the highest level of quality.</li>
    <li> These are a good alternative to the big brand blades at a good price.</li>
    <li> First of all I am not one to exaggerate in a review.  I don&#x27;t care for people that write reviews blasting something just because they can&#x27;t use common contextual sense with a purchase and get a bug up their bum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is to follow is absolutely true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used these blades for months now and here is what I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp but more than any other blade I have used since starting to shave 34 years ago (think about that time line and the type razors) these blades give me nicks nearly every third shave or more often. If not a nick when I rinse my face I feel many stings spread across the shaven area.  I have always made sure the timing of my shave is optimum for soft and moist skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPARISONS:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Gillette mach III that these blades I figured would replace, still has a worn out razor on it.  I currently can shave with it, as heavily used  as it is and get as good a shave and no nicks or stings when rinsing as with a brand new personna or anything thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) the original genuine trac II razors far surpassed these blades.  Note; even two blades of the original trac II are better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I ordered so many thinking I hit the jack pot.  Absolutely will pay more for a genuine blade if personna is my other choice.</li>
    <li> I wanted to save a few bucks on some replacement razor blades that fit my handle.  These do at almost 1/2 the price.  Do they stay sharper longer or as long?  I can not tell.  Still need to replace them regularly.</li>
    <li> Most of the 5-star reviews are one offs - in other words, a single review for the reviewer.  My guess is that the 1-star reviews are the more accurate.  Really sleazy.</li>
    <li> Lousy. Did not even donate unused blades to thrift shop. Did not want someone else to get scammed by purchasing these junky things. Threw in trash.</li>
    <li> Did not work well at all for me:  I didn&#x27;t get a very close shave with them, and I found it very easy to nick myself.  They were definitely worse performing in both respects than the Gillette Sensor and Mach 3 blades I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I&#x27;ve used these some more, and have decided they&#x27;re really bad.  I just cannot get a close shave out of these, and they cause a lot of nicks.  I have no idea where all the good reviews are coming from:  possibly they used to be better.  But the ones I got are just terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I&#x27;m just throwing the rest away.  They&#x27;re that bad.</li>
    <li> These are good, long-lasting blades, and they do work perfectly with the Preserve razors (and they are much less expensive).</li>
    <li> I purchased these Personna blades to see how they fare up against the Gillette blades.  There are less expensive and I seem to get the same or more shaves from them.</li>
    <li> I received the razors in less than the time I was told.</li>
    <li> Not only is this blade cheaper than the Gillette blade but the quality is great.  I will continue to purchase this blade from Amazon as long as they carry it in stock</li>
    <li> I was excited about this. Finally, a way to save some money on razor blades after 15 years of using the Gillette Sensor (original)! Saves me money but gives me too many cuts after I use it for the 3rd time. I get almost no cuts with the original but this  is CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT. You get it. Good for people who toss the blade after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> These are great blades, they hold their edge well but do tend to clog up fast, just have to keep rinsing them.</li>
    <li> I love these razor blades. I have been using them solely for years. I believe these are the men&#x27;s blades but it was more cost effective to buy them than the women&#x27;s blades and let&#x27;s face it they&#x27;re the same thing. I bought them initially because they weren&#x27;t tested on animals. I get the occasional nick or cut if I&#x27;m not careful, but that&#x27;s the same with any razor,although I will admit I get the occasional bad blade from the box that I have to ditch (that&#x27;s happened a couple of times). While it might not be the best for the blades, shaving with conditioner instead of shaving cream makes my legs so soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Simply put, like others have said, these are awesome!  Lasted longer than name brands and sent to my door.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for a long time.  Pair this with a Razorpit and you can 5x the life of each blade.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> Better than Gillette refills. It says I need sixteen more words so I guess I will type some more words.</li>
    <li> Well, maybe not twice as long, but definitely longer.  Also comparing new to new, these pull less and give you as close of a shave as the Gillette blades.  Also, they don&#x27;t plug up like the Gillettes.  The shavings from these can be simply rinsed out where the Gillettes I had to rinse and tap on the basin as well.  Definitely a better all-around shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get ripped off buying the brand name!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works just as well as the brand name, and much cheaper than in the store.</li>
    <li> work as well as originals, seem to last the same too</li>
    <li> these are the best blades by far....i will buy these again and have recommended personna to all my friends.....</li>
    <li> this product is great and you cant beat the price</li>
    <li> My personal choice, thin body blades.  A blade will last me 3 weeks or more.  I shave 3 days a week.</li>
    <li> Better than the originals and very comfortable shave at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> These work at least as well as the disposable razors that Gillette sells, but not as well as the Sensor cartridges.  They rust very easily and don&#x27;t hold an edge as long as a result.  Good enough for me to use up the ones I have, but I&#x27;ll be changing blades when these run out.  On the plus side, I do like using these better than the disposables because I like the weight and grip of the Sensor handle as opposed to the chintzy plastic handles on the disposables.  That&#x27;s their only real advantage in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Since Costco quit carrying the Gillette Sensor II, I discovered that these are just as good, and less expensive.</li>
    <li> These fit my razzor perfectly.  My old cartridges had two blades and these have three.  I didn&#x27;t think it would make much difference, but it does.</li>
    <li> These blades fit just like the original and they shave just as well. Razor blades can be really expensive and this is a great alternative to paying full price.</li>
    <li> It great if you have a 1990 model razor, and the price is okay, also!</li>
    <li> I ordered these to fit the Gillette Sensor razor which is normally a 2 blade razor. This has 3 blades but I think they are too close together. They don&#x27;t work well for me. I do not shave every day so that may be the problem. I bought the actual Sensor Blades and they work much better for someone who shaves every 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> Great price, and, fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> Works well but wider than the OEM blades so its harder to get into tight spots like between nose and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I&#x27;ll probably keep using them.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these razors.  Name brands I have used cost three times more and do not perform any better.</li>
    <li> Work as good or better than my expensive Gillette Blades</li>
</ol>
