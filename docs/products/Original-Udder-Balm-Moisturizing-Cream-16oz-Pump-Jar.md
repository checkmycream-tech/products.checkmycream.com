<li> If you&#x27;re a dude with hard-working hands and just don&#x27;t like cracks on the sides of your fingers by the nails, this will help you get your fingertips back to normal.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a thick, quality consistency that is readily absorbed in your skin.  </li>
<li> I mean this stuff is almost miraculous, right up there with Neosporin + Pain Relief in its ability to heal.</li>
<li> However, as winter has been approaching like the spectre of doom and my skin is starting to get dry, I was developing these hangnails on the sides of my fingers, cracks on the sides, and even a couple of hangnails way up by the cuticle.</li>
<li> I bought it for riding bikes a long distance, to prevent chafing and stinging, saving some money instead of only buying DZNUTS.</li>
<li> This turned very dry and parched skin into regular skin, but I need to reapply it at least twice a day as it does not last.</li>
<li> My husband has very rough, dry feet.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> I just use a little blob about half the size of a dime</li>
<li> I even used it on a bad case of chapped lips and they healed up quickly.</li>
<li> I put some Udder Balm on my hands a few times over a day and a half, and all of those hangnails and cracks freakin&#x27; disappeared!</li>
<li> The name of this product made me not want to use it on my hands, because cow udders are nasty and I don&#x27;t want to think about slathering yellow slime all over some cow&#x27;s wrinkled-up, dirty, dusty, stretch-mark-riddled udders.</li>

    <li> Great stuff if you have rough beaten up skin . It will revitalize your skin</li>
    <li> Love this product, but once the unscented was available, I switched.  You can read the lengthy review I left on that product.  Whether scented or unscented, nobody makes a better lotion or moisturizer than Original Udder Balm.  Period.</li>
    <li> Living in the dry desert it is perfect......moist, smooth and rich.....! Utter balm solves the dryness  problem........One, two, three, done....!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love all of the Udder Cream products.  Nice, clean, fresh aroma; not overpowering. It leaves your skin feeling fresh and renewed.  It&#x27;s a thick, quality consistency that is readily absorbed in your skin.  I will definitely buy this product again; highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand lotion and foot lotion ever.  Its not greasy and it works.  After a long day with shoes on, nothing feels better on my feet.  It does not take much.  A little goes a long way and I also love the fact I can get it in a pump Jar.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite moisturizer! Love the light lemon scent.</li>
    <li> Lovely slight lemon smell. My massage therapist asked me what I use on my skin! He said he had never felt skin as soft as mine!</li>
    <li> Wow! The name of this product made me not want to use it on my hands, because cow udders are nasty and I don&#x27;t want to think about slathering yellow slime all over some cow&#x27;s wrinkled-up, dirty, dusty, stretch-mark-riddled udders. However, as winter has been approaching like the spectre of doom and my skin is starting to get dry, I was developing these hangnails on the sides of my fingers, cracks on the sides, and even a couple of hangnails way up by the cuticle.

I bought it for riding bikes a long distance, to prevent chafing and stinging, saving some money instead of only buying DZNUTS. How great to find out its excellent healing properties. It&#x27;s the best lotion/cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m the kind of guy who hates to put anything on my skin, but when you need the benefits I&#x27;ve described above, nothing I&#x27;ve used will do it better. It&#x27;s got vitamin E, A and D, Aloe, Lanolin etc. If you&#x27;re a dude with hard-working hands and just don&#x27;t like cracks on the sides of your fingers by the nails, this will help you get your fingertips back to normal. If you&#x27;re a woman, don&#x27;t fear the gnarly name of Udder Balm. It&#x27;s fantastic!!! I love the pump jar too, if it costs a little extra it&#x27;s worth it! I just use a little blob about half the size of a dime and it does both hands.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream ever!</li>
    <li> I have been using the original letter bomb for years. A friend of mine who is a rockclimber recommended it highly and I agree! I use a full body &amp; it works great - not greasy, absorbs well. I don&#x27;t know if the stuff is used on animals… I don&#x27;t really care because it&#x27;s great on my skin!</li>
    <li> This turned very dry and parched skin into regular skin, but I need to reapply it at least twice a day as it does not last.</li>
    <li> Cream is amazing on the hands, non greasy, leaves them smooth; soft and leaves them non-tacky. I even used it on a bad case of chapped lips and they healed up quickly.Great product, recommend to everyone that uses a hand cream regularly</li>
    <li> You will love the scent and how great and soft your skin feels!! I promise. One try of and you will love it!</li>
    <li> THE BEST moisturizing cream in the world. It quickly heals cuts anad nicks to hands from outside work. It tames my eczema and smooths skin to feel like silk. It also absorbs well into skin quickly so you don&#x27;t feel it just sitting there like an oily layer of gunk slathered on your body.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night.  My feet have never felt better.  My husband has very rough, dry feet.  He goes to the foot doctor every 5 weeks and this last time the Podiatrist told him that his feet seemed  a lot  better than the last visit.  He continues to use  daily and we both are very happy with this product and the results.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Best lotion that I have found for dry skin, ever. When I first put it on, I thought it might be greasy, but it soaked in and was barely greasy, if at all.</li>
