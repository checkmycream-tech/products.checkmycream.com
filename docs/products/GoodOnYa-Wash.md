      <li>This is also great for people that suffer from eczema.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just great all the way around.  </li>
      <li>This was a great product.</li>
      <li>So, when GoodOnYa&#x27; was offering their Honey Face Wash Cleanser and Body Wash for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I decided to order and add this product to my collection.</li>
      <li>this is that good for you.</li>
      <li>I have been using Good on &#x27;Ya products for over two years now</li>
      <li>I really loved how thus smelled (like frosted donuts) but it kept giving me eczema after a couple weeks.</li>
      <li>It seems clean and nourished from the excellent ingredients they use.</li>
      <li>My skin has not looked or felt this healthy since I was a child!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>My skin felt smooth and great.</li>
      <li>Best product ever...removes makeup and cleanses gently.</li>
      <li>and I know you will just love this product.</li>
      <li>Truly love these products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m probably just allergic though, I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t happen to most people.</li>
      <li>I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion...</li>
      <li>Face &amp; Body Wash leaves your skin in much better condition.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this Honey Face Wash Cleanser and Body Wash from GoodOnYa&#x27; and recommend it for everyone.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve used many.</li>
      <li>I love GoodOn Ya&#x27; products and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
      <li>I also like to pair it with the daily moisturizer and there you have the perfect skin care regimen.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing and worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It is mild, but effective.</li>
      <li>This is a very mild --and even &#x27;healing&#x27; face &amp; body wash, while still cleaning thoroughly.</li>
      <li>so why wouldn&#x27;t I have all my products be sulfate free.</li>
      <li>I have been using sulfate free shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>free cause your skin to have a ph that is off.</li>
      <li>It is nice though if you can afford to go through it that fast</li>
      <li>My face feels so clean and</li>
      <li>I was able to get this product at a deep discount in exchange for a review with my honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
      <li>My face looks clean and has a glow.</li>
      <li>Most other liquid bath &amp; shower gels &amp; soaps may smell good, but the odorless, PH balanced &amp;#34;GoodOnYa&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This, (and their microdermabrasion and moisturizer) were the first products which along with a great diet that actually worked and she no longer has acne.</li>
      <li>I bought these products initially to prove they weren&#x27;t as good as they said...</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  </li>
      <li>With body mitts use about a dime to quarter size amount for your whole body and top off with the moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I could see the water staying on my skin longer instead of beading off right away.</li>
      <li>And this face wash is super gentle and soothing and it contains aloe vera and manuka honey.  </li>
      <li>The wash cleanser is very gentle and you can eat</li>
      <li>By using this sulfate free face and body, it brings your skin back to a healthy ph of 5.5 and leave it clean at the same time.</li>
      <li>This is the first one that doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
      <li>I got my money back, and my face is doing much better again.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product, leaves skin soft</li>
      <li>I have been using this GoodOnYa&#x27; Cleaner for almost a week and from the first time I could feel and see a difference.</li>
      <li>In certain areas where other &#x27;soaps&#x27; leave me irritated and stripped of body oils, the &amp;#34;GoodOnYa&amp;#34; feels so nice and non-irritating.</li>
      <li>I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THE ODOR OF THE PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>these have made a real difference for me.</li>
      <li>It did not lather up much at all</li>
      <li>It is gentle on your skin.</li>
      <li>And like I said, its really gentle on the skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really convenient also since you don&#x27;t have to use a separate make up remover or an astringent.  </li>
      <li>my adult acne is basically gone!!!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t think of any other better products for my face.</li>
      <li>This takes off ALL makeup easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry.  </li>
      <li>Not enough time to give full rating</li>
      <li>When it arrived I was reading the label and the main purpose of this product</li>
      <li>I live in an arid climate...</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Using the moisturizer after cleansing makes me feel as though I went to the spa for professional care.</li>
      <li>Also, I used to have to use large amounts of lotion to keep the skin on my legs from being incredibly dry, but I no longer have that problem.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why, it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or anything, and I even think it helped my acne, but I just kept breaking out</li>
      <li>As a 30-year old woman with acne on both my face and back, this has cleared up all of my problem areas in a matter of a couple of weeks.</li>

<li> Only need to use a small amount as a little goes a long way.  </li>

<li> Wasted some since it came out watery.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two years and never grow tired of it.</li>
<li> SORRY.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these products initially to prove they weren&#x27;t as good as they said...two year later I&#x27;m still using them daily.  I use both face and body washes.  I live in an arid climate...these have made a real difference for me.</li>
    <li> Use all their products after having breast cancer.  The wash cleanser is very gentle and you can eat&lt;br /&gt;the ingredients- this is that good for you.</li>
    <li> I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THE ODOR OF THE PRODUCT. NOT SURE WHY IT WAS SO HIGHLY PRICED. NOT AT ALL HAPPY SO I RETURNED FOR REFUND. SORRY.</li>
    <li> Best product ever...removes makeup and cleanses gently.</li>
    <li> I have been using sulfate free shampoo and conditioner so why wouldn&#x27;t I have all my products be sulfate free. So, when GoodOnYa&#x27; was offering their Honey Face Wash Cleanser and Body Wash for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I decided to order and add this product to my collection. When it arrived I was reading the label and the main purpose of this product is to bring your skin back to a balanced ph. Regular soaps and cleaning products that aren&#x27;t sulfate free cause your skin to have a ph that is off. By using this sulfate free face and body, it brings your skin back to a healthy ph of 5.5 and leave it clean at the same time. I have been using this GoodOnYa&#x27; Cleaner for almost a week and from the first time I could feel and see a difference. I could feel the moisture and softness of my skin. I could see the water staying on my skin longer instead of beading off right away. I absolutely love this Honey Face Wash Cleanser and Body Wash from GoodOnYa&#x27; and recommend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> My skin has not looked or felt this healthy since I was a child! As a 30-year old woman with acne on both my face and back, this has cleared up all of my problem areas in a matter of a couple of weeks. I have thrown away all of my acne products and medicated cleansers. Also, I used to have to use large amounts of lotion to keep the skin on my legs from being incredibly dry, but I no longer have that problem. This product is amazing and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> has made all my skin softer - use it in the shower as well as for face cleaning</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used many. It is mild, but effective. Using something that is pH balanced makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t think of any other better products for my face.I&#x27;m so grateful I found this products.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion... This was a great product. I usually don&#x27;t use this type of facial wash on my face due to my sensitive skin. But this product didn&#x27;t break me out. My skin felt smooth and great. My face looks clean and has a glow. I started using this in the morning and at night before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> I really loved how thus smelled (like frosted donuts) but it kept giving me eczema after a couple weeks. I really don&#x27;t understand why, it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or anything, and I even think it helped my acne, but I just kept breaking out and my face got itchy after using it every morning. I got my money back, and my face is doing much better again. I&#x27;m probably just allergic though, I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t happen to most people.</li>
    <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and a little goes a long way.  It is gentle on your skin.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful cleanser! I don&#x27;t normally use face wash, I&#x27;ve stuck to a washcloth and water as every wash I&#x27;ve used in the past stripped away all my natural oils and left me feeling like I&#x27;d crack. This is the first one that doesn&#x27;t do it. My best friend turned me on to these products and she suffered from acne for 15 years. This, (and their microdermabrasion and moisturizer) were the first products which along with a great diet that actually worked and she no longer has acne. Love that the ingredients are so natural with literally nothing bad in them.</li>
    <li> Not enough time to give full rating</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My face feels so clean and my adult acne is basically gone!!! They aren&#x27;t kidding when they say it&#x27;s concentrated, a little drop goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This along with the scrub is now an essential part of my skin care regimen. Using the moisturizer after cleansing makes me feel as though I went to the spa for professional care. Truly love these products.</li>
    <li> This is a very mild --and even &#x27;healing&#x27; face &amp; body wash, while still cleaning thoroughly. In certain areas where other &#x27;soaps&#x27; leave me irritated and stripped of body oils, the &amp;#34;GoodOnYa&amp;#34; feels so nice and non-irritating. I highly recommend it for those &#x27;delicate&#x27; skin types, but ALL skin types will react well to it. Most other liquid bath &amp; shower gels &amp; soaps may smell good, but the odorless, PH balanced &amp;#34;GoodOnYa&amp;#34; Face &amp; Body Wash leaves your skin in much better condition. I&#x27;ve been using it for two years and never grow tired of it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good face wash. I&#x27;ve used it for several years now, and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, leaves skin soft</li>
    <li> See my review under eye serum. I use this product twice daily and have for well over a year now. I like how my skin feels. It seems clean and nourished from the excellent ingredients they use.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and bought this item. I thought it was too watery. I was hoping this would be a thicker cleanser. Wasted some since it came out watery.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time now and find it cleans without any harsh chemicals and leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this cleanser. It did not lather up much at all and I prefer a soapy wash.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cleanser I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> For the price and the amount you get it doesn&#x27;t rate as well as my Cetaphyl I have been using for years.  It is nice though if you can afford to go through it that fast</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the natural ingredients.  This takes off ALL makeup easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry.  Only need to use a small amount as a little goes a long way.  With body mitts use about a dime to quarter size amount for your whole body and top off with the moisturizer.  The combination is excellent.</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash!  I was able to get this product at a deep discount in exchange for a review with my honest and unbiased opinion.  I love GoodOn Ya&#x27; products and this is one of my favorites.  This is truly an all in one cleanser!  You can use it to remove make up, wash your face, and also as a body wash.  And this face wash is super gentle and soothing and it contains aloe vera and manuka honey.  This is also great for people that suffer from eczema.  It doesn&#x27;t sting like soaps and body wash.  I have smoother skin and it&#x27;s not so dry and also have less blackheads.  It&#x27;s just great all the way around.  It&#x27;s really convenient also since you don&#x27;t have to use a separate make up remover or an astringent.  And like I said, its really gentle on the skin.  You also don&#x27;t get that tight feeling that you get with soap.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  I also like to pair it with the daily moisturizer and there you have the perfect skin care regimen.  Use it morning and night and I know you will just love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Good on &#x27;Ya products for over two years now and I can&#x27;t imaging going back to regular soap after using this face cleaner.  I buy it in the 64 oz. bottle.</li>
