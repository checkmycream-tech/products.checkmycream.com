### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Smells great!!</li>
      <li>Best decision I could have made because it turned out to be perfect for me,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy</li>
      <li>and it seems like everybody are happy with it.</li>
      <li>Which is good since I cannot stand any perfume that has floral notes in it.  </li>
      <li>I THINK THIS is a lovely sexy fragrance at a great price!</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t care because I think I like this even better!  </li>
      <li>This is almost &amp;#34;nasty.&amp;#34;  Good thing it was cheap cause I will be trashing my bottle!</li>
      <li>Thrilled to buy it from Amazon...</li>
      <li>great scent, priced right.</li>
      <li>This is a perfume with a real strong smell at the beginning but after a couple of hours it smells nice and mild.</li>
      <li>Lime &amp; spices on top, followed by a bit of jasmine,</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>Caf&amp;eacute; is an oriental, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>great scent, sexy &amp; vibrant smell without being overbearing..</li>
      <li>I am a musk lover and find that sweet, spicy blends with amber and such blend with my body chemistry the best.  </li>
      <li>I easily get whiffs of vanilla &amp; cinnamon.</li>
      <li>It has a good price and high quality, I would buy it again</li>
      <li>It is sweet and spicy as well as exotic.  </li>
      <li>It smells cheap (I know...</li>
      <li>For a 30-year-old fume, Caf&amp;eacute; seems timeless to me and darn cheap too.</li>
      <li>but at this great price I can afford to use a couple extra sprays as it fades.  </li>
      <li>Is good, and exactly what I waiting for, thanks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than a number of discounted fumes that are being offered at higher prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I most certain.</li>
      <li>It was dellivered right on time!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a tad sweet, but not in a 2000s like of way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet and spicy, and I like it.</li>
      <li>good price for \\&quot;french perfume\\&quot;</li>
      <li>She says it wears off really quickly</li>
      <li>Honestly it far exceeds perfumes on the market in this classification that go for three times or more what this costs.</li>
      <li>it was what was expected , my mother loved it.</li>
      <li>it IS cheap, with a $12 price tag what did I expect), and when I say &#x27;cheap&#x27; I mean &#x27;gas station bathroom smell&#x27; cheap (kind of like the &#x27;Scrubbing Bubbles cleans as it flushes&#x27; but should have been changed 6 months ago smell).</li>
      <li>A modest fragrance is suitable for most women today, can be a daily fragrance perhaps to go to work.</li>
      <li>a fragrance called Caf&amp;eacute; packaged in a box decorated with golden coffee beans outside &amp; darker coffee beans inside, I was expecting more coffee.</li>
      <li>Too much musky smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a spicy scent almost like nutmeg, but balanced with white light floral and heady musk.  </li>
      <li>fast delivery</li>
      <li>I really like it although my husband says it smells like hairspray......</li>
      <li>like it, I really do.</li>
      <li>It matched my criteria of the scents that I like and at the super low price</li>
      <li>highly recommend...</li>
      <li>; is different enough to get noticed among a bevy of syrupy sweet gourmands.</li>
      <li>I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.  </li>
      <li>However, Caf&amp;eacute; is not particularly unique or special if classified as a spicy oriental.</li>
      <li>Light spritzes don&#x27;t last, and a heavy hand produces headaches.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it..fast delivery</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my mom. She says it wears off really quickly but she likes it so..</li>
    <li> Is good, and exactly what I waiting for, thanks.</li>
    <li> Caf&amp;eacute; is an oriental, that&#x27;s for sure. Lime &amp; spices on top, followed by a bit of jasmine, I most certain. It&#x27;s just a tad sweet, but not in a 2000s like of way. I easily get whiffs of vanilla &amp; cinnamon. The drydown is spicy &amp; dry imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a fragrance called Caf&amp;eacute; packaged in a box decorated with golden coffee beans outside &amp; darker coffee beans inside, I was expecting more coffee. It&#x27;s not a listed note but coffee is in there, and every once &amp; awhile I pick up a whiff of the brew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caf&amp;eacute; is different enough to get noticed among a bevy of syrupy sweet gourmands. However, Caf&amp;eacute; is not particularly unique or special if classified as a spicy oriental. For a 30-year-old fume, Caf&amp;eacute; seems timeless to me and darn cheap too. It&#x27;s better than a number of discounted fumes that are being offered at higher prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, I really do. Sadly, it&#x27;s headache-inducing for me. Suspected culprit: Jasmine, although not listed. Light spritzes don&#x27;t last, and a heavy hand produces headaches. Cocktailing hasn&#x27;t worked and has even sharpened the headache. I would otherwise be using my bottle to wear. So sad. :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a spicy scent almost like nutmeg, but balanced with white light floral and heady musk.  I really like it although my husband says it smells like hairspray......I don&#x27;t think it does at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I  found this parfum for My Mom for her Christmas present. She loves the fragance. It was dellivered right on time! Thank you</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume after reading some positive reviews and found it to be just awful. It smells cheap (I know... it IS cheap, with a $12 price tag what did I expect), and when I say &#x27;cheap&#x27; I mean &#x27;gas station bathroom smell&#x27; cheap (kind of like the &#x27;Scrubbing Bubbles cleans as it flushes&#x27; but should have been changed 6 months ago smell). If you&#x27;re looking to turn somebody off and never to return, this is the perfume to do the job.</li>
    <li> I THINK THIS is a lovely sexy fragrance at a great price! imported from France and is not easy to find in the local market.  Thrilled to buy it from Amazon... highly recommend...great scent, sexy &amp; vibrant smell without being overbearing..good price for \\&quot;french perfume\\&quot; (toilette but you know what i mean)..YAY!!!</li>
    <li> Smelled nothing like coffee. To me it smelled like something an older woman would wear, slightly powdery and floral.</li>
    <li> This is a perfume with a real strong smell at the beginning but after a couple of hours it smells nice and mild. I knew this perfume since long time ago . I bought 4 of it, one for me and 3 as gift and it seems like everybody are happy with it.</li>
    <li> I had never even heard of this perfume before but while searching for one of my olld time favorites, which has become so hard to find,  I read about this.  It matched my criteria of the scents that I like and at the super low price I figured I had to try it. Imean what did I have to lose.  Best decision I could have made because it turned out to be perfect for me,  Turns out I cannot find my oldy but goodie but I don&#x27;t care because I think I like this even better!  It is sweet and spicy as well as exotic.  It tends to lean towards an oriental and I cannot detect one bit of floral in it.  Which is good since I cannot stand any perfume that has floral notes in it.  I am a musk lover and find that sweet, spicy blends with amber and such blend with my body chemistry the best.  I wear this day and night.  It&#x27;s only drawback is it isn&#x27;t quite as long lasting as I would like but at this great price I can afford to use a couple extra sprays as it fades.  I cannot believe the price.  Honestly it far exceeds perfumes on the market in this classification that go for three times or more what this costs.</li>
    <li> it was what was expected , my mother loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for a mom&#x27;s gift, she loves it. It has a good price and high quality, I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Smells great!! But the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all. 5 stars for the scent. 2 for the scent not sticking around to be noticed.</li>
    <li> The one time I tried a sample spray of Instyle Impressions version of Opium, I noticed that it smelled like scented candles on me. This fragrance is a long-lasting oriental scent that also has the scented-candle effect on the dry down. It&#x27;s sweet and spicy, and I like it.</li>
    <li> great scent, priced right.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance.  Ordered it at Amazon&#x27;s recommendation.  Would not order again.  Too much musky smell. I will use it as a air freshener when I am in a pinch.  In my opinion, it smelled too &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; for me and this is coming from someone that likes Ester Lauders&#x27; Youth Dew.</li>
    <li> ES DELICIOSO ES TAL COMO RECORDABA ESTA FRAGANCIA Y PENSE QUE NUNCA MAS LO ENCONTRARIA EN EL MERCADO..GRACIAS POR BRINDARMELO</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.  This is almost &amp;#34;nasty.&amp;#34;  Good thing it was cheap cause I will be trashing my bottle!</li>
    <li> 100% RECOMENDABLE, EL PRODUCTO EN BUEN ESTADO, LO RECOMIENDO 100% RECOMENDABLE, EL PRODUCTO EN BUEN ESTADO, LO RECOMIENDO, GRACIAS GRACIAS</li>
