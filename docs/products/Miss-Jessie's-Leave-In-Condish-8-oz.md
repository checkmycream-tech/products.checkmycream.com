      <li>I would have been better off putting nothing on it.</li>
      <li>and I purchase it all the time :)</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>In the morning I use this condish on my hair and it makes it look so much better after it dries.</li>
      <li>I put it on the top of my hair for any hair that may be sticking up and then pull it along the ends of my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried too many to mention.</li>
      <li>This product is great and has a soft nice scent.</li>
      <li>So you have to shampoo more often.</li>
      <li>I did, probably paid more than this Amazon price.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fantastic!)</li>
      <li>I just wanted to share some love for this product since I just absolutely love it</li>
      <li>Enjoy, ladies!</li>
      <li>Ok on my hair - no miracle.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so impressed with this one, I definitely will.</li>
      <li>bought on the recommendation of another curly girl, Caucasian, who is friends with a woman who is Indian-American, also with curly hair; they both use and love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love the creamy feel of this conditioner on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this leave in conditioner hair product.</li>
      <li>The instructions say to towel off excess moisture before applying but with my hair type I&#x27;ve found I get better curl</li>
      <li>Also, after using Miss Jessie&#x27;s for awhile, I noticed I had to wash my hair more often.  </li>
      <li>Got a free sample in the mail and had to come buy it!</li>
      <li>I had much more build up with this product.  </li>
      <li>( I wouldn&#x27;t buy the stylers cause most of them are loaded with mineral oil</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair.</li>
      <li>I use it after each time I take a shower to reduce frizz and add shine! :)</li>
      <li>So far, this is working great in my girls hair.</li>
      <li>and when i use products in my hair they just make it greasy and weigh it down, but Miss Jessie products are absolutely perfect!</li>
      <li>(The drugstore hair serum seems to work fine for me.)</li>
      <li>I, too, got a sample of this in the mail, and I loved it so much that I already ordered a full bottle.</li>
      <li>I would have been more detailed in the video, but I didn&#x27;t want it to be too long because uploading is a pain in the butt, lol.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s important that the products I use aid in my detangling process.</li>
      <li>This makes everything smooth and silky feeling.</li>
      <li>I love a lot of volume and tend to wear my hair very \\&quot;big\\&quot; and for what I was looking for, it delivered!</li>
      <li>Worth every cent!</li>
      <li>Expected more from this product as I had heard good things about Miss Jessie&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>maybe once in a while for a special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have quite as much slip as I wanted, but I do think it&#x27;s better at conditioning and detangling than Kinky Curly Knot</li>
      <li>anyways, That&#x27;s why I bought the full size here.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair nice and soft...</li>
      <li>, the shampoo and the deep treatment were also good) but the leave in is the truth.</li>
      <li>My oil was sweet almond oil.  </li>
      <li>Best product for extremely thick and curly hair.</li>
      <li>The overall health of my hair was better with Aubrey while still keeping a frizz free healthy look.</li>
      <li>I place this regiment in all the Miss Jessie&#x27;s products I use because at times I searched far and wide on how to perfect my wash-n-go&#x27;s</li>
      <li>She has super curly hair and we struggle with tangles.</li>
      <li>I highly reccommend this product and I can&#x27;t wait to try more from the Miss Jessie line.</li>
      <li>I really hope my opinion doesn&#x27;t change - I love the stuff right now.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that I rinse product out of my hair every night in the shower and start fresh in the morning, so</li>
      <li>Meh - a little to cloyingly sweet smell wise.</li>
      <li>We use 3 of their procucts and they are just right.</li>
      <li>She is happy that I have found something that won&#x27;t leave her crying from her tangles!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different hair products for my son&#x27;s hair type and this is by far the best yet!!  </li>
      <li>I through it out after the first use</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying more.</li>
      <li>This product smells great but left my hair dry and lifeless.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well on our 7 year old daughter&#x27;s curly hair, but we never a fan of the smell.</li>
    <li> This really helps soften my 4a/4b/4c hair... I have 3 different textures in my hair, so you can imagine how difficult it is to maintain these strands. I don&#x27;t use the Miss Jessie&#x27;s shampoo, I have WEN for that, but the Miss Jessie&#x27;s leave-in condish is great for me. Here&#x27;s my regiment: I wash with my WEN shampoo, then I put the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Leave-in Condish on my damp hair in four sections. I put all natural African Shea Butter to seal in the moisture, and lastly, as my styler I use Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls (for 3a and softer hair texture I suggest Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls). Use your fingers only when applying these products, never your comb. As Taylor Swift sang, to define your curls Shake It Off! Don&#x27;t try to separate your curls with a comb or your hands, once the products are distributed all over your hair then just shake your hair in a &#x27;yes&#x27; &#x27;no&#x27; &#x27;all over&#x27; motion and voila! you&#x27;re done. I place this regiment in all the Miss Jessie&#x27;s products I use because at times I searched far and wide on how to perfect my wash-n-go&#x27;s and this is how I do it. For those who has given Miss Jessie&#x27;s a bad review, it wasn&#x27;t that the product was bad, maybe it just wasn&#x27;t compatible to their hair textures, so I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have looser waves and they often get weighed down by most curly products. I put a little dab of this on my wet hair before I use any product (I often use Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow soft curls afterwards--also LOVE) and my hair is soft and CURLY. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love any Miss Jessie product, so quite naturally,  I love this leave-in. Its not heavy, and greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week along with Miss Jessica&#x27;s Multiracial Curls. I am biracial and it&#x27;s been hard to find a product(s) that will boost my curls as well as make them look healthy and shiny at the same time. I am very please with this product and highly recommend it to others.  Doesn&#x27;t build up and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> Love the way my natural black hair feels</li>
    <li> Got a free sample in the mail and had to come buy it! Smells great. Left my 4c hair soft with minimal frizz after a two strand twist out. Good morning mositurizer too. Wouldn&#x27;t use everyday, because it seems like you could get some build up. Good porduct, great price for a Ms. Jessie brand</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well for fine, long curly hair, and smells wonderful.  Used on daughter along with slippery shampoo and creme de la creme conditioner, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Well, I have to admit, I never had Miss Jesse&#x27;s products on my radar due to the cost and the ingredients.  But, I was in my local Wegman&#x27;s and saw that they had the pillow soft curls and the jelly soft curls products as well as this leave-in.  I saw the price of the leave in condish and also brought the jelly soft curl gel as it was only 14 dollars.  Surprisingly the ingredients did not look bad at all.  In any event, I did the LOC method on my 3c/4a hair.  My oil was sweet almond oil.  I have to say, I had the best wash n go I&#x27;ve ever acheived.  The curls were spiraled, soft, and elongated.  Even after it dried my hair was still soft with little shringage, and very defined curls.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This product smells great but left my hair dry and lifeless. Won&#x27;t buy again. 4C natural here.</li>
    <li> Miss Jessies products by far the best products for my biracial daughters hair. I&#x27;ve tried too many to mention. We use 3 of their procucts and they are just right. Moisterizing without being to heavy for her hair. The Best!</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders!  I looove it!</li>
    <li> I love Miss Jessie&#x27;s but this was not the best on my daughters more mediterranean type hair.</li>
    <li> I, too, got a sample of this in the mail, and I loved it so much that I already ordered a full bottle. I&#x27;m always on a quest to find a great leave-in conditioner that I can use on my daughter&#x27;s hair for detangling and the nightly finger-comb. I was very impressed with this product. It left her 4B hair soft, moisturized, and frizz-free. After a night of beauty sleep, I just spritzed her hair with water, and it was still beautiful. It doesn&#x27;t have quite as much slip as I wanted, but I do think it&#x27;s better at conditioning and detangling than Kinky Curly Knot Today. And I&#x27;m not wild about the scent--it smells like soap, which is fine, but it&#x27;s a bit overpowering and &amp;#34;mature-smelling&amp;#34; for my baby girl. But the price is right, especially for a Miss Jessie&#x27;s product! (Miss Jessie--if you&#x27;re reading this, I&#x27;d buy your entire line if they were all priced like this product!) Overall, I&#x27;m replacing Knot Today (a styling staple in my house) with Leave In Condish!</li>
    <li> its not good for people with thick 4b hair because it dries right out as if it was never used in the first place.Its okay but not what I expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for a while for something to control my crazy hair in the morning, and this is the only product that I love from the multiple products I&#x27;ve purchased. Most hair products that I&#x27;ve been trying say that you must use them right after the shower and you must dry your hair for them to work. I personally like to take a shower at night, and then deal with my crazy dried hair in the morning. In the morning I use this condish on my hair and it makes it look so much better after it dries. I put it on the top of my hair for any hair that may be sticking up and then pull it along the ends of my hair. It&#x27;s kind of like a girl gel but just way better, with a nice smell. I randomly purchased this item at target and I&#x27;m sure happy I did, probably paid more than this Amazon price. Just a little about me--I have thick wavy hair. Hope this helped you! I just wanted to share some love for this product since I just absolutely love it</li>
    <li> Meh - a little to cloyingly sweet smell wise. Ok on my hair - no miracle.</li>
    <li> First I would like to say I am comparing this product to the one I normally use, Aubrey Organics - Calaguala Fern Hair Thick/Conditioner.  My hair type is in between 3b &amp; 3c, and I live in the northeastern US; it can get pretty humid, and I live near the city.  I think how your hair reacts not only depends on the products you use, but also the environment in which you live.  I tried this product for about a month.  It does the job; my hair was smooth, frizz free, and made my hair soft, but it weighed my curls down a bit.  I like to have a lot of volume with my curls, and the other product is lighter on my hair.  Also, after using Miss Jessie&#x27;s for awhile, I noticed I had to wash my hair more often.  I had much more build up with this product.  At the end of the day, my hair would be drier too; as with my usual product, my hair stayed softer.  I got this product because it&#x27;s cheaper than Aubrey, and I heard good things about it, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It&#x27;s good for a sleek look once in while, but I think I&#x27;ll just go back to Aubrey for my everyday use.  The overall health of my hair was better with Aubrey while still keeping a frizz free healthy look.</li>
    <li> This product does not create soft recognizable curls.  It sets in the hair like cement, and has to be vigorously washed out.  It made my hair greasy, lumpy in places, flat in others, and made me angry that I&#x27;d spent so much money on it.</li>
    <li> It works well as a product but the smell is so floral and overpowering that I can&#x27;t use it.  I gave it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a ton of money on products to keep my curls moisturized and healthy looking; tried cheaper brands, high end brands and a lot in between. I now use only this product with a small amount of hair serum. (The drugstore hair serum seems to work fine for me.) I scrunch my hair while using a diffuser. My hair looks amazing!! Curls are defined and moisturized and the style holds up all day. Unlike the many other products I tried, this one does not weigh my hair down; curls are soft and bouncy. I don&#x27;t end up with frizz half way through the day. There is no build up and product washes out with regular shampooing. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other products but I&#x27;m so impressed with this one, I definitely will.</li>
    <li> Great product and good scent.</li>
    <li> I have in between kinky-soft-super curly hair that gets frizzy and is hard to maintain. This product is great and has a soft nice scent. I like to mix this with AG Recoil activator to get soft curls that stay for a long time. Excellent buy and I purchase it all the time :)</li>
    <li> Miss Jessie gets it! I have long thick wavy hair that sometimes resembles that of a sheep or lions mane. I encourage what some in the community of wavy/curlies call &amp;#34;encouraging clumping&amp;#34;. This product enables me to do just that! However, it is a layering product, as it says, so I put some in my hands and mix with moisturizing conditioner! The results are well defined waves that are clumped to make hair look as though they very little volume. Since I have small face, I need to de poof as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely mix this, though. By itself, it&#x27;s waxy and heavy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says on the back that this is a style prep. As such, it left my hair so silky smooth that people were like, &amp;#34;Is that your hair?&amp;#34; Anyway, I got this as a sample. Ive stocked up on it now. I cant live without it. I wonder if it&#x27;s the soy that makes it so soft?  Lately, people talk about glucose sugars as a more smoothing chemical thancones and bkt. Agave, soy, etc.</li>
    <li> I have super fine dry hair and this product was too heavy. My usually curly hair turned out slightly wavy and flat. I also didn&#x27;t like the scent - it was too sweet and heavy although it wasn&#x27;t so bad by the second day. When I spritzed my hair with water it would revive the smell again. So I am returning this product.</li>
    <li> The conditioner was thick and did not disolve into my hair well.  It felt like it needed to be rinsed out and did not offer any styling benefits.</li>
    <li> I wish that it was a spray instead.  It is very hard to get the stuff to come out-lol!</li>
    <li> Needless to say I am a huge fan of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products. This product works very well, just like the others I&#x27;ve tried. Just a small amount smoothed into damp hair is all that is needed to keep hair moisturized, smooth and supple. I have noticed much less breakage on my relaxed hair too. I am 4 months in to my transition and am loving my curls! I highly recommend this product as well as her complete line for us curly girls!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair look and feel soft and glowy, but it leaves white flakes.  So you have to shampoo more often.</li>
    <li> Atrocious.  It dried and flaked so bad in my hair. Did absolutely nothing for my hair. I would have been better off putting nothing on it.</li>
    <li> I got a sample bag with the leave in conditioner at a natural hair show and I fell in love with it ( to be fair, the shampoo and the deep treatment were also good) but the leave in is the truth. ( I wouldn&#x27;t buy the stylers cause most of them are loaded with mineral oil, I refuse to spend a lot of money on mineral oil or petroleum jelly, no ma&#x27;am) anyways, That&#x27;s why I bought the full size here. I have a mix of 3bc4a hair  and it moisturizes all of the textures really nicely. My sis has 3c hair and she loves it too as both a leave in and styler. Personally, I use whipped Shea butter ( whipped w bjco and jojoba oil) on after because I need something to seal in moisture and weigh down my curls a bit. Anyways, sorry so long winded, bottom line try it :) I think it would be good for a lot of curl types.</li>
    <li> OMG!! love this product! It leaves your hair nice and soft...WELL it did for ME!!!</li>
    <li> We love it works great and smells amazing !</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Could not find at my Target locally, or my regular grocery store, so I ordered it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought on the recommendation of another curly girl, Caucasian, who is friends with a woman who is Indian-American, also with curly hair; they both use and love this stuff. Their texture is very different from mine-- thin, fine and wavy, vs very curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My African -American friend has super thin, fine hair and felt this did not work as well for her, but she is very tightly and kinky-curled, and her texture is even more coarse and rough than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian with very thick, coarse and bushy, spiral-curly hair underneath and looser, less spirally curly hair on top. It is not thin or fine anywhere on my head, and it has various types of curl throughout (spiral, wavy, kinky, and weirdly, almost straight)-- and lots and lots and lots of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only use this right after washing my hair. If I try to put it in my 2nd or 3rd day, unwashed hair, it can feel too thick and stiff, and does not perform the same as when put in wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really helps hold the curl pattern and reduce frizz, though I still do use Frizz ease or another silicone/dimethicone product as my hair has no natural shine due to its coarseness/roughness. I do not have issues with silicones or derivatives, as my hair is so very thick--if it were fine or fragile, I would not use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I air dry and never blow dry; I do not straighten or flat iron my hair. I do not use curlers or rollers of any kind. Not for everyday--maybe once in a while for a special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave-in condish is a great addition to my hair-care arsenal. It is not too expensive, lasts a long time and does not have an unpleasant smell. I do not break out on my hands or head when using this regularly, which happens often enough with other products I have used.</li>
    <li> smells a little weird but i dig the end result.</li>
    <li> Expected more from this product as I had heard good things about Miss Jessie&#x27;s products. Smells like soap and didn&#x27;t help my girls with frizz.</li>
    <li> I love the creamy feel of this conditioner on my hair.  When dry, I&#x27;m left with well nourished, soft curls.  I use a little almost every day, along with their curling products. My hair is in great condition, and I feel I&#x27;m in good hands with this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed by this product, I had to write a review right away. I&#x27;ll update it if I change my mind.&lt;br /&gt;I have 4c hair that gets dry like the sahara desert in the ny summertime, even with all the humidity. Like bone-dry. I came home day after wearing it in a bun, and spritzed it with the oyin spray, but that hardly helped at all. My hair still felt like the desert, with maybe a sprinkling of rain that evaporated before it had the chance to penetrate the ground. So, I tried this product. Bam, my hair is manageable and soft. It was absolutely miraculous. Like, I could actually comb my hair right now if I wanted to, whereas before that would have got you a hello, no.&lt;br /&gt;The price for this product is reasonable in comparison to others. I really hope my opinion doesn&#x27;t change - I love the stuff right now. HG product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: when I want a lighter product, I mix this with some water and some refined coconut oil. Glorious.&lt;br /&gt;Love.this.product.</li>
    <li> I love this leave in conditioner hair product. I&#x27;ve tried several different hair products for my son&#x27;s hair type and this is by far the best yet!!  It  keeps his hair moisturized all day long and holds his curls very well.  I highly reccommend this product and I can&#x27;t wait to try more from the Miss Jessie line.</li>
    <li> I have curly dry unmanageable hair and when i use products in my hair they just make it greasy and weigh it down, but Miss Jessie products are absolutely perfect! All of them. This one is my favorite. Its a leave in and i can air dry or blow dry. Scrunch or straighten. It protects my hair from the heat of blow drying and gives me shine without the weigh down. Smells great too and most of all it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
    <li> I actually got a sample of this product through Birchbox.  I gave the sample to my daughter.  She LOVED it, so I bought her some for Christmas.  She has very long hair and she says this product works great.</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft not stiff like a lot of leave-ins do. No heavy scent to it either. Nice product.</li>
    <li> So far, this is working great in my girls hair. She has super curly hair and we struggle with tangles. I put a little bit in her hair when it is damp and let it sit for a little while. Then I comb out her hair while it is still wet. She is happy that I have found something that won&#x27;t leave her crying from her tangles!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It has a very refreshing smell and works great on natural curly hair.</li>
    <li> Best product for extremely thick and curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it after each time I take a shower to reduce frizz and add shine! :)</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully on my wavy/loose curls! A little goes a long way. The instructions say to towel off excess moisture before applying but with my hair type I&#x27;ve found I get better curl definition of my hair is still very wet. I apply it before leaving the shower - a dime size or less was enough when my hair was long, and now I use a pea sized amount that my hair is shorter. I gently scrunch extra moisture out with a Turkish woven towel (peshtamal) and let my hair air dry. I get great, loose, soft curls with very little frizz. I usually spritz in some humectant (Frank Juice by Oyin Handmade - it&#x27;s fantastic!) for extra frizz control before leaving the house.&lt;br /&gt;I do want to note that I only wash my hair 1-2 times a week because I&#x27;ve found my hair seems healthier and my scalp is less irritated by less frequent washing. On days I am not washing my hair, I spritz in humectant before and after showering and gently finger comb my hair.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:80e757ed351481c19d066d94839a4796]] This works wonders for kinky hair, in my opinion. I have some of the thickest 4C hair you can imagine and this condish makes detangling so much easier. I&#x27;ve been on a no heat, no comb regimen for over a year, so it&#x27;s important that the products I use aid in my detangling process. This makes everything smooth and silky feeling. It defines the curls that have already been defined using other Miss Jessie products. I just love it, altogether. I would have been more detailed in the video, but I didn&#x27;t want it to be too long because uploading is a pain in the butt, lol. Enjoy, ladies!</li>
    <li> This is the best product on the market. Hands down. Worth every cent! Can&#x27;t live without it on my curly hair. Forever customer!</li>
    <li> I always like to add the disclaimer that all products are different for everyone, so always use discernment reading another&#x27;s review. As for this product, it worked well for me. I put it on my dampened shoulder length, thick relaxed hair and found that it gave me the volume and defined curls that I wanted. I only worked in about a quarter size into my hair and allowed my hair to air dry. I love a lot of volume and tend to wear my hair very \\&quot;big\\&quot; and for what I was looking for, it delivered! Keep in mind that I rinse product out of my hair every night in the shower and start fresh in the morning, so I cannot speak to build up because I rinsed it out that night. Because I didn&#x27;t use a lot, the smell was fresh, but minimal. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Left my hair very soft. It did smell a little too lemony for my tastes but it works.  Only use a small amount unless your hair is super thick.  I think i used a little too much on my finer hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and the moisture it gives to my hair.</li>
    <li> Not at all what it claims to do waist of too much money</li>
    <li> most horrible crap I have ever used in my hair. I through it out after the first use</li>
    <li> OMG Where was this CONDISH all my life!!!!!!?????????? Soft hair great curls.......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found the perfect leavi-in condtioner for my transitioning hair!</li>
    <li> I use it with JBCO to seal moisture and my daughter&#x27;s hair is looking healthier after on week of use. I&#x27;m definitely buying more.</li>
