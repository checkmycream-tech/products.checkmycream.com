<li> As well, it was new, came in a box, and had extra samples of other products Perfumania offered!</li>
<li> It is soft, a bit powdery, jasmine, a little fruit, and throw in some Champagne ...</li>
<li> Works harder when body heat rises.</li>
<li> Not worth it</li>
<li> Unfortunately, one of the packages had been hit hard enough that the body lotion broke open and was every where.  </li>
<li> I am not a huge fan of Jessica Simpson, but her perfume is about the only scent I like &amp; can wear without feeling sick later.  </li>
<li> I think this perfume is fake because it did not hold the smell.</li>

    <li> I Love both of these!! Will be ordering soon&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> perfect, love this perfume</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of Jessica Simpson, but her perfume is about the only scent I like &amp; can wear without feeling sick later.  Love this scent!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance !  It is soft, a bit powdery, jasmine, a little fruit, and throw in some Champagne ... ooh yes!&lt;br /&gt;Good to layer with a strawberry  ( which in combo smells divinely delicious ), or a tangerine/orange body spray.&lt;br /&gt;A tad sweet.  Somewhat decadent . I do not detect a spice...&lt;br /&gt;Sexy. Cuddly. Perfect for winter with cozy angora and  winter pastels.&lt;br /&gt;I have other celebrity fragrances, some are great, some are blah, just okay, or not worth really a mention.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only Jessica Simpson fragrance I own , and I am in love.&lt;br /&gt;That makes me either want to try more of her line.. or not - keep only the Fancy Love, because I have found a cold season perfection.</li>
    <li> I think this perfume is fake because it did not hold the smell. Do not buy this product!!! Not worth it</li>
    <li> good value and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I received this perfume within a week of my purchase, which was quick! As well, it was new, came in a box, and had extra samples of other products Perfumania offered! The quality was fantastic; this perfume is exactly the same as one you would buy anywhere else, so it&#x27;s not a rip-off. As well, this was the cheapest price I found out there, both online and in stores. Believe me, this is a great buy! THANK YOU PeRfUmAniA~</li>
    <li> Smells like water, sprays like water, it&#x27;s got to be water! I&#x27;ve been buying this for years at the department stores. This looks like the bottle, but what is inside, not so much!</li>
    <li> I liked the combination of items.  This scent is heavenly.  It is light and floral.  I just love it and have enjoyed the compliments received on the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very nice but just know actualy perfume is smaller than lotion and gel</li>
    <li> I ordered two because this is my favorite perfume.  Unfortunately, one of the packages had been hit hard enough that the body lotion broke open and was every where.  They should actually replace the body lotion!!  It would have been a five had the lotion not be all over.</li>
    <li> WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSED THAT IT ARRIVED 3 DAYS AFTER I PLACED ODER!  AND RECIEVED 2 FREE PURFUMES SAMPLES! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>
