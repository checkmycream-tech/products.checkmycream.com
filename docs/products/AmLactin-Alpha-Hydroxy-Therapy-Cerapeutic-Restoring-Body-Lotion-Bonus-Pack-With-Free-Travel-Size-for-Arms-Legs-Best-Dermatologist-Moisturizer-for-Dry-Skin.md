      <li>Liked the lotion.  </li>
      <li>Nice mouisturizer</li>
      <li>As most have commented it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell awesome.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best lotion.</li>
      <li>The smell is gone very quickly leaving you with the softest skin you never thought you would have!</li>
      <li>(okay, like 25 years).This version is even more soothing/nourishing.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
      <li>The longer you can leave it on w/o washing, the better.</li>
      <li>I use this stuff on my feet, and it couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this cream.</li>
      <li>hands more than 5 minutes now.  </li>
      <li>It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used, including $150 per 9 gram tube prescription stuff.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many things to fix the problem.</li>
      <li>My face is looking better...</li>
      <li>Love how the skin on my arms and legs look smoother and healther.</li>
      <li>I really love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t love the non smell smell.</li>
      <li>Great product,  fast shipping, recommended by dermatologist for my son,</li>
      <li>Be sure to protect yourself from repeating this mistake.  </li>
      <li>Works good, but not as good as the old Amlactin XL formula in the tube.</li>
      <li>, therefore I had many hypo-pigmented scars on my shoulders and chest from breakouts.  </li>
      <li>my skin and feet  feel  better, softer and dewy.  </li>
      <li>Gets rid of flakes and leaves a healthy, dewy glow.  </li>
      <li>Works as well or even better than some prescription lotions that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>because I don&#x27;t believe this version is any more &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; than the original</li>
      <li>Easy access to product recommended by dermatologist, will reorder.</li>
      <li>It is too strong to use on my neck or face.  </li>
      <li>Hands down The Best Lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>It helps to smooth out your skin.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, the odor disappears after the lotion dries on the skin.  </li>
      <li>However I wake up,shower and find my skin smooth and moisturize.</li>
      <li>AmLactin is a good over the counter skin medication and helps clear up my skin condition.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amlactin really can&#x27;t be evaluated by the same criteria as mostother lotions; if you&#x27;re looking for luxurious feel at the time of application or a delicious smell</li>
      <li>This is great lotion, but it does have a rather strange smell.  </li>
      <li>version (Cerapeutic) versus &#x27;Original&#x27;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>giving this version 4 stars (the original I would give 5+)</li>
      <li>It was originally recommended for my feet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been an avid user of AmLactin (ammonium lactate) for many years</li>
      <li>Dermstore, the vendor, shipped quickly and wrapped the bottle securely.  </li>
      <li>this stuff is life changing, i have tried so many different types of lotions and creams, and have also made my own in hopes that it would help my skin.</li>
      <li>This works great on my dry skin.</li>
      <li>This lotion is very effective in relieving dry skin.</li>
      <li>Like most Amlactin products,  you really *</li>
      <li>Keeps my hands nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Good substitute for the big guns, like urea cream that the dermo prescribes.</li>
      <li>Not worth having to put another nice smelling cream on top.</li>
      <li>My Dermatologist told me to get some of this for my dry skin and boy, does it work good.  </li>
      <li>This particular version follows the &#x27;original&#x27; lotion and does very much the same - very, very effective.</li>
      <li>It is however, worth every penny.</li>
      <li>fresh and dewy.</li>
      <li>It is supposed to be odor free, and once it is on my skin I don&#x27;t smell it, but it isn&#x27;t completely odor free.</li>
      <li>The Cerapeutic version does feel a bit thicker and more lotion-like on application than the original and my feeling is that Amlactin is trying to get people over the initial \\&quot;this feels weird-ish\\&quot; period when they are first trying</li>
      <li>Left my skin feeling very smooth.  </li>
      <li>I tried putting it on after a shower, as was my habit with previous moisturizers, but putting it on my skin when it&#x27;s dry seems to work best for me.  </li>
      <li>I have keritosis pilaris and this significantly reduced the bumps on my arms and legs and made my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>For the first time in years, I picked up a cup with an iced beverage and didn&#x27;t feel like it was burning my hands.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t heed the warning and sure enough, the problem area on my legs burned.  </li>
      <li>I was blown away from the first time I used it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice lotion but this is the worst smelling Fragrance free I&#x27;ve ever smelled!</li>
    <li> This may hydrate, but I haven&#x27;t been able to tell because it has an unpleasant feel to it, I have to mix it with other lotions to cut down on the sticky sensation, and sometimes I use it as the first step in cleansing my face, kind of like cold cream, followed by a regular cleanser.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very effective in relieving dry skin. Applied twice daily, it has reduced the wrinkling on my arms caused by old skin losing elasticity.  As others have stated, a little goes a long way.....you have to be careful not to get too much and waste it.  But the price is easier to accept if you know that the bottle will last a while.</li>
    <li> First time trying this. When it&#x27;s on I almost feel like I have sticky honey on. And not just then...not just hours later...almost over night! However I wake up,shower and find my skin smooth and moisturize. My face is looking better...fresh and dewy. I have tried to put a smaller amount on. I do have adult acne...And it is healing those spots. Pores not as large and dullness less. I am happy with this and plan to continue to use it...worth my dollars spent.</li>
    <li> AmLactin Cleared up skin abrasions and discoloration within a week</li>
    <li> It has not met up to what wassaid aAbout the same as other less expensive products.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Just a little goes a long way. Really makes skin supple for the entire day. Covers up wrinkly dry skin fast.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hands nice and soft.</li>
    <li> It works better on my hands that any other lotion my dermatologist has had me use.  My dermatologist recommended that I get it, and it helps me a lot since I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> i will continue to buy this every month even though it is a little pricey, it is worth it!! i have dry, thick, scaly skin on my hands/wrists, inner elbows, knees, and ankles, and this stuff has made a tremendous difference. it softens the skin and helps it to exfoliate. if you have never used this before, just know that if you have tiny abrasions or scrapes this lotion will burn for a minute. i felt a difference after just 3 days of use! this stuff is life changing, i have tried so many different types of lotions and creams, and have also made my own in hopes that it would help my skin. this amlactin (not even the green-top one) is the only thing that works!</li>
    <li> loved it will buy again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a moisturizer, but it doesn&#x27;t have any properties that make it better than other moisturizers.  There is some pseudo-science here, but nothing truly scientific.  It has a strange ammonia smell, and it feels very weird on the skin.  I can&#x27;t keep myself using it because it is so uncomfortable and the smell is noticeable.  For those reasons it doesn&#x27;t get a good score from me.</li>
    <li> The only reason this is getting four stars is because it leaves a tiny bit of stickiness behind that the other Amlactin lotions do not.  All of the Amlactin products are wonderful!  I have Graves disease (auto-immune) and I do not heal well, therefore I had many hypo-pigmented scars on my shoulders and chest from breakouts.  The Amlactin products have brought back pigment to those scarred areas and in only 2 weeks!!!!!  I am shocked at the results!  If you have extremely dry skin or acne scarring, these Amlactin lotions will really help you!</li>
    <li> the best skin care product. highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I like this product for it&#x27;s lactic acid content. The first time I used lactic acid, it was in the form of a chemical peel solution that you apply and wash off in a few minutes. It took a while to apply the solution and it my opinion it just wasn&#x27;t efficient enough. With this lotion, you can apply it anywhere and you don&#x27;t have to wash it off. The only negative thing I have to say is that its a bit oily. That doesn&#x27;t bother me too much but it may bother some of you.</li>
    <li> Smells like Nair or permanent hair solution.  I prefer Glytone because it is a much better product and does the same thing</li>
    <li> This product deserves a 5 star rating for performance but a 4 or even 3 star for the odor.  Fortunately, the odor disappears after the lotion dries on the skin.  The lotion has been the only thing to work on my extremely dry skin on my arms, legs and feet.  It is too strong to use on my neck or face.  My dermatologist recommended it but I couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  Dermstore, the vendor, shipped quickly and wrapped the bottle securely.  I</li>
    <li> Good substitute for the big guns, like urea cream that the dermo prescribes. That is all I have to say</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer. I add it to Aveeno lotion to stretch it a bit.</li>
    <li> Because of a thyroid disorder, my skins has been dry for years.  I constantly looked like my entire body had dandruff.  I bought this last Saturday and started using it.  Here it is five days later and it&#x27;s hard to believe the difference.  My skin is soft and there&#x27;s no sign of dryness.  For the first time in years, I picked up a cup with an iced beverage and didn&#x27;t feel like it was burning my hands.  The stuff is amazing. My legs, arms, hands, and feet are all softer.  It is supposed to be odor free, and once it is on my skin I don&#x27;t smell it, but it isn&#x27;t completely odor free. I don&#x27;t, however, find the odor as offensive as other Amlactin products. I very highly recommend this if you have extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion, seems to do all that it promises in the ads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid user of AmLactin (ammonium lactate) for many years (okay, like 25 years).This version is even more soothing/nourishing. I keep it at work and use it on my hands, but Is suppose it would be great for body/face as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with Glytone Body Wash for my son&#x27;s Keratosis Pilaris.  He applies this lotion 2x daily after showers, but we have not seen real results yet.  It has only been about 3 weeks, so I will purchase a few more bottles to give it a couple of months before I can make a real judgment.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product but way too expensive here. I buy it at CVS for half this price. Yep, exact same bottle. And usually there is coupon for 2 dollars off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Amlactin as I&#x27;ve found it is literally the only lotion that actually combats, rather than covers, the dry skin issues that I have. This particular version follows the &#x27;original&#x27; lotion and does very much the same - very, very effective. Like most Amlactin products,  you really *should*  use the lotion twice per day as suggested for the first week or two and then evaluate from there as your first few uses you may think, \\&quot;Ick..this doesn&#x27;t feel like it works.\\&quot; I can now use it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Absolutely, 100% works for combating dry skin, even severely dry, and at least mild keratosis pilaris (can&#x27;t comment on severe cases as mine is relatively mild).&lt;br /&gt;2. You only need a relatively small amount of product so the expense is mitigated somewhat (I had to learn to adjust my application and not base it on initial moisturized feel or use of other lotions).&lt;br /&gt;3. Works as well or even better than some prescription lotions that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t have a classic, lotion-application feel and initially seems rather thin and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;2. As most have commented it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell awesome. I find when using it as a &#x27;workhorse&#x27; once past the initial use period that it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me. You can use other lotions in between applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This version (Cerapeutic) versus &#x27;Original&#x27;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure what they&#x27;re getting at with this one. The Cerapeutic version does feel a bit thicker and more lotion-like on application than the original and my feeling is that Amlactin is trying to get people over the initial \\&quot;this feels weird-ish\\&quot; period when they are first trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this version 4 stars (the original I would give 5+) because I don&#x27;t believe this version is any more &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; than the original and I think it may actually work just very slightly less well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amlactin really can&#x27;t be evaluated by the same criteria as mostother lotions; if you&#x27;re looking for luxurious feel at the time of application or a delicious smell this isn&#x27;t the product for you. If you don&#x27;t mind or want a workhorse, then I&#x27;d suggest giving it a try for a couple weeks!</li>
    <li> THAT&#x27;S ALL i NEED TO SAY...BEST MOISTURIZER EVER.. SOFTEST HANDS AND FEET INTHE WORLD.  NO MORE DRY SKIN.  TRY IT</li>
    <li> A little bit of a plasticky smell but that goes away soon after application.  I have keritosis pilaris and this significantly reduced the bumps on my arms and legs and made my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> No better than ordinary lotion.</li>
    <li> Product works great. Had purchased one prior on Dr. recommendation at CVS. reason for only three stars is I could not get the pump to work. I was able to use the pump from one purchased at CVS but disappointed in broken pump.</li>
    <li> the best we have found for a moisturizer hands down guaranteed the best out on the market ..try it you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> Gets rid of flakes and leaves a healthy, dewy glow.  I use this on my face.  It is more effective than the extra strength Origins, Kiehl&#x27;s, and Embryolisse products I have used in the past.  There is a slight maple syrup odor, but no one has noticed and it does not bother me.</li>
    <li> I have only used a couple of times so far at bedtime, but my skins already feels and looks better.</li>
    <li> I was recommend another brain of this lotion by a dermatologist due to my severe dry skin and decided to try this.  It has an unpleasant smell but after awhile you get used to it.  It cures my itchy dry skin and that&#x27;s all ever wanted from a lotion.</li>
    <li> AmLactin is the best!! I have dry flaking skin, my forearms were like leather. I guess to much sunshine. With this skin has become softer and Hydrated!! No more flaking! I highly recommend it! And I paid for this with my own money!! Updated 7/31/2015 Just have to say that you really need to try this if you have dry skin!!! No other lotion compares to AmLactin cerapeutic!!!</li>
    <li> Terrible scent and not &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; as .described by the company on its web page.  Not at all comparable to Lac-Hydrin Five which I&#x27;d used for 30 years.  I&#x27;d read all the reviews relating to the scent and thought how bad could the odor be?  I took a chance and I&#x27;m sorry.  Although the product is expensive and I do need something for very dry skin, this lotion isn&#x27;t for me and it&#x27;s now in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Too thick and I do not like the smell.</li>
    <li> Works good, but not as good as the old Amlactin XL formula in the tube. Plus, it smells horrible. Not worth having to put another nice smelling cream on top.</li>
    <li> Love this!  It helps to smooth out your skin.  It does sting a little on just shaved legs!</li>
    <li> Im hooked, it really works, tranforms dry, skin, gets rid of hang nails, callouse, sun damage! the best</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t love the non smell smell.</li>
    <li> Good but somewhat greasy!</li>
    <li> Easy access to product recommended by dermatologist, will reorder.</li>
    <li> Got this for a skin condition, as recommended by my dermatologist, and it works great.  Like so many other positive comments on here- it is GREAT lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought a sample size of this to take on a trip, and as soon as I returned hime bought a larger bottle. I live in the Desert Southwest and usually over the winter I get skin that is so it itchy it drives me crazy. This stuff made my skin soft, smooth, in just a couple of days. True, the smell is a littke weird and I got some strange looks from my husband when I put it on my arms during a flight, so I&#x27;ll just stick to putting it on before bed.  I tried putting it on after a shower, as was my habit with previous moisturizers, but putting it on my skin when it&#x27;s dry seems to work best for me.  I try to take advantage of coupons and sales, but hinestky compared to department store creams, this is a bargain for what it does.  I took off one star for the weird smell.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion. I am in my early thirties, and in the past few years, I have noticed changes in the elasticity of my skin. This lotion has improved my skin, and it makes it look so youthful! It makes my skin like silk, and it tightens and firms everything up. The condition of my skin has improved even when I am not wearing it. I have received several compliments, so I know it is noticeable to others, too. I just can&#x27;t believe how perfect it is. I am so happy I tried it. I also break out from seasonal allergies. The pollen is so bad where we live, and my chest and face break out into terrible hives. I have tried so many things to fix the problem. Most of it just made it worse or it just didn&#x27;t do anything at all. This is the ONLY lotion that works to clear it. It is not advertised to do such, but it has such a calming effect--it just works. It is a perfect, all-in-one lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I used it 25 years ago, the cost was $25.00 with insurance.  No insurance, it would have been $125.00. The other amlactin in a larger bottle is not as good.  It is too watery.</li>
    <li> This stuff absolutely rocks. I first heard about this stuff on a news show (NOT an infomercial). An actress (I forget her name) was asked what she used to keep her skin looking so good. She said she had the money to buy anything on the market, but Amlactin is the only thing she used because it by far worked the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There are two versions of this stuff, &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; in a brown bottle and &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; in a blue bottle. I&#x27;ve always used the stuff in the blue bottle, because I assumed the &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; stuff would be stronger. That&#x27;s my assumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have extremely dry skin, and have tried many products. All I can say is you&#x27;ve got to try this stuff. It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used, including $150 per 9 gram tube prescription stuff. You can actually feel it soaking in slowly, for hours.</li>
    <li> This is great lotion, but it does have a rather strange smell.  I use it on my legs and feet with great results.</li>
    <li> I will use only on body. I CANT stand it on fingers/hands more than 5 minutes now.  Sticky and rubber-like&amp;#62;&amp;#62; literally feels like it is smothering skin.</li>
    <li> This product is somewhat more liquid than the one in the green writing. Otherwise I like the larger bottle.  The green bottle I was only able to obtain in the 7 oz.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  MY SKIN WAS CHANGING INTO A HORRID TEXTURE OF SUPER DRY BUMPY LINES AND THE SKIN ALSO FELT THICKENED AND STIFF.  THIS PRODUCT BEGAN WORKING THE INSTANT I APPLIED IT TO MY SKIN - AND AFTER THE FIRST APPLICATION - - MY SKIN WAS ALREADY &#x27;HEALING&#x27; - GREAT PRODUCT! I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WITH SUPER DRY SKIN PROBLEMS...ITS JUS WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> This product is highly effective, I only wish it was a bit less expensive.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Wish it was cheaper..</li>
    <li> I use this stuff on my feet, and it couldn&#x27;t be better. Gets rid of that dry whiteness around the toes, without the usual grinding/scraping/whatever that often causes more problems. Most lotions that you buy have a brief, topical effect that doesn&#x27;t last. This is much different. The longer you can leave it on w/o washing, the better.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  I wish I had found it sooner.  I would recommend it to everyone who has dry cracked heels.</li>
    <li> Was given a sample of the product from a Doctor to try!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This works great on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great product without the perfume smell. If you want a product to smell great this isn&#x27;t for you. But if you want a great moisturizer I recommend this. I never heard of it until my dermatologist recommended it.  Use it all the time now.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it.  After my first application I said to myself this is one is a keeper.  Love how the skin on my arms and legs look smoother and healther. M. Hill</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist told me to get some of this for my dry skin and boy, does it work good.  Daily use makes your skin soft as a baby&#x27;s XXX!  It exfoliates dead skin and really makes your skin look brand new.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Hands down The Best Lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! A little goes a very long way and that&#x27;s important because this lotion is not inexpensive. It is however, worth every penny. And just as others have said,  this lotion is not pleasantly scented.  Once you&#x27;ve applied it to the place or places you&#x27;re going to use it, the chemicals interact with your skin and produce a smell a bit like ammonia. The smell is gone very quickly leaving you with the softest skin you never thought you would have! This lotion was created to heal and soften the toughest skin you&#x27;ve got and it does exactly what it says it will do. Use 2 times a day and you&#x27;ll be thrilled in under a week! I was blown away from the first time I used it and you will be too!</li>
    <li> Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Cerapeutic Restoring Body Lotion works to keep my skin soft; especially my hands and feet. It was originally recommended for my feet. In only a week of daily use my feet went from feeling and looking rough with mottled white patches to soft all over and uniformly pink. I now use it about two times a week. The only way I could be happier with the product is if it was less expensive and, you guessed it probably, if it smelled better. I highly recommend for dry skin.</li>
    <li> very effective,  will buy more soon.&lt;br /&gt;jim</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.  It was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  Other lotions I&#x27;ve used include Cerave and Cetaphil. Amlactin isn&#x27;t always easy to find at a retail store, and it was much less expensive on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product,  fast shipping, recommended by dermatologist for my son, but he  still needs something stronger and  creamier.  The size is too small for the price, but is the only one presentation.</li>
    <li> Delivery arrived as stated.  AmLactin is a good over the counter skin medication and helps clear up my skin condition.</li>
    <li> This helped with the skin problem i was having very well.</li>
    <li> Nice mouisturizer but it didnt help my KP probs.</li>
    <li> The first and only AmLactin that didn&#x27;t work well for me. The smell is fine, I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers were smelling, but the problem I had was the lotion caused considerable acne on my arms. It was essentially the reverse of what I was looking to achieve. Perhaps the lotion is too thick for my skin type. I won&#x27;t rate the product negatively, as not everything works well for everyone, but be warned that those with sensitive skin may have an adverse reaction.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this lotion would help more with the post-partum chicken skin that has developed on my arms. It has reduced it about 30% so I can&#x27;t say it hasn&#x27;t helped at all. It is thicker and more sticky than other lotions so I tend to just put it on at night before bed.</li>
    <li> I understand everyone&#x27;s skin is different and some will tolerate it in  different ways.  I have super dry, itchy skin along with sand paper feet,  especially in cooler months.  The pros on this is ...my skin and feet  feel  better, softer and dewy.  The cons are...sort of sticky and does smell like maple syrup. None of which bother me. A little does go a long way, so  adjust accordingly.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Works like it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> People complain about the odor but I had no problem with it.  Left my skin feeling very smooth.  Product recommended to me by my doctor.  I have a warning to mention, though.  Printed clearly on the container is an alert that it can increase the skin&#x27;s sensitivity to sunburn.  I didn&#x27;t heed the warning and sure enough, the problem area on my legs burned.  And blistered.  And scabbed over.  UGLY!  Be sure to protect yourself from repeating this mistake.  Used as directed, it&#x27;s a very good lotion.</li>
    <li> Reeived a sample from a Dermatologist.  Liked the lotion.  Used as a topical over Triamcinolone Acetonide</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. It&#x27;s really effective at smoothing out little bumps on the arms and legs. It really eliminates dry skin overtime. The only downside is it&#x27;s pretty greasy. It goes away after a while but in the beginning it annoys me.</li>
    <li> you know I don&#x27;t know if it makes my skin younger...but it defiantly is the best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, my legs stay shiny and soft all day, never dry looking knees 2 hours after you put lotion on.</li>
    <li> Dr. recommended this for my daughter and it really has worked and taken care of her bumpy spots on her skin.  She does not have psoriasis, but something that is similar and this stuff worked, where psoriasis creams from the prescriptions did not.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist  recommended this to help remove rough spots on my legs.  It works!</li>
    <li> Recommended by our doctor for our kid&#x27;s keratosis pilaris. It works well.</li>
    <li> A very good product. I seems to help new tissue grow on my arms, and did help with the thinning skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is and will be the best lotion ever!!</li>
