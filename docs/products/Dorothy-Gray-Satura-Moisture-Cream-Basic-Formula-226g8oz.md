      <li>My mother introduced me to this product many years ago.</li>
      <li>I used Dorothy Gray&#x27;s Satura for many many years until it could no longer be purchased in the stores.  </li>
      <li>It is a simple formula and it works great!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d better check what happen to my order.</li>
      <li>Satura Moisture Cream is probably one of the most versatile creams on the market.</li>
      <li>She was glad to find that it is once more available.</li>
      <li>My skin is very dry and this cream is wonderful</li>
      <li>They have clearly taken a great product and somehow messed it up.</li>

      <li>Have been using this product as a facial moisturing cream since 1976 and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Perfume Zen for making this available for all.</li>
      <li>Your outstanding customer service shows your committment no only to the customer, but to Amazon.com!</li>
      <li>After the most recent shipment she called me and said the cream was very greasy.</li>
      <li>I am 52 yrs old with fair, dry, very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>HER LOOKING VERY YOUTHFUL, ALMOST LIKE A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.  </li>
      <li>I have tried MANY MANY MANY different creams (oh, if I had a dollar for each one...) from health food stores to expensive department stores.  </li>
      <li>This beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;Great price - save your money for Dior cosmetics instead of high price crèmes!</li>
      <li>When you have super dry skin and really need full strength moisture with overnight results, you can&#x27;t beat this classic or it&#x27;s counterpart the Dorothy Grey Vitamin A</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t get it near your eyes!</li>
      <li>And now that I&#x27;m older it works very well with my dryer skin type, and moisturizes my face and neck all night long.</li>
      <li>I have recently started to add some Vit E oil to it in a seperate little container, and I believe that has made it even better.    </li>
      <li>WOMEN LIKE TO KEEP THEIR YOUNG APPEARANCE</li>
      <li>AND IT KEEPS MY SKIN MOIST AND SOFT,</li>
      <li>However, the last batch turned out very greasy.</li>
      <li>FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH DRY SKIN, WILL BE SMART TO START NOW,</li>
      <li>People are surprised, they think I&#x27;m much younger</li>
      <li>Wish they would go back to their old processing plant and/or formula.</li>
      <li>It goes on a little \\&quot;greasy feeling\\&quot; at first, then it just disappears into your skin.</li>
      <li>She has found no other product to equal it.</li>
      <li>I always get excellent service from Amazon; however, I was very disappointed in this product this time around.  </li>
      <li>I RECOMEND SATURA BASIC FORMULA FOR A DRY AND MATURE SKYN, AND</li>
      <li>Even good for badly chapped lips.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered the item on OCT. 26, 2009.  I did NOT even get it and am STILL waiting and wiating.  It has passed over one month.  I am NOT living in Antartica.  Please dont send me the mail for rating the time.  You&#x27;d better check what happen to my order.</li>
    <li> My mother has been using this product for over 40 years. When she couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore I started getting it for her on line. After the most recent shipment she called me and said the cream was very greasy. Not like the cream she has been using. She noticed that although the front label was the same, the place of manufacture was different on the back. I found out that Dorothy Gray was recently purchased by a different company. They have clearly taken a great product and somehow messed it up.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product exclusively. She has found no other product to equal it. She was glad to find that it is once more available.</li>
    <li> My mother used Satura with Vitamin A over 40 years ago - and it&#x27;s still around today, what does that tell you?  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 years.  No one believed me when I told them my birthday was the big 50 - they all thought I was 40!!!!    I like the review where Vitamin E was used with the Satura, I&#x27;m going to try it.      Don&#x27;t buy those expensive creams, give Satura a try.  It goes on a little \\&quot;greasy feeling\\&quot; at first, then it just disappears into your skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I love the way my skin feels.  I use it in the colder weather and my skin just soaks it in and feels luxurious.</li>
    <li> This is another product my mother put me on to when I was younger and it&#x27;s as great today as it was thirty years ago. And now that I&#x27;m older it works very well with my dryer skin type, and moisturizes my face and neck all night long. People can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m in my sixties, they think I&#x27;m younger! I like that as well. I continue to use this product forever.[[ASIN:B001R94ETG Dorothy Gray Satura Moisture Cream Basic Formula: 8 OZ]]</li>
    <li> Have been using this product as a facial moisturing cream since 1976 and loved it.  People always say what great skin I have. However, the last batch turned out very greasy. Re-ordered immediately from another company.  Still greasy.  Don&#x27;t know if the formula has changed though it doesn&#x27;t appear to have from the list of ingredients. Wish they would go back to their old processing plant and/or formula.</li>
    <li> When you have super dry skin and really need full strength moisture with overnight results, you can&#x27;t beat this classic or it&#x27;s counterpart the Dorothy Grey Vitamin A and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Even good for badly chapped lips. Just don&#x27;t get it near your eyes!</li>
    <li> Satura Moisture Cream is probably one of the most versatile creams on the market. It will take the sting out of sunburns and leave your body and face really smooth and it smells wonderful! Thanks Perfume Zen for making this available for all. Your outstanding customer service shows your committment no only to the customer, but to Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> MY MOTHER HAS BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND IT HAS KEPT HER LOOKING VERY YOUTHFUL, ALMOST LIKE A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.  I STARTED USING IT MYSELF SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND IT IS THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET BY FAR.  WOMEN LIKE TO KEEP THEIR YOUNG APPEARANCE AS LONG AS THEY CAN AND IF THEY USE THIS CREAM DAY AND NIGHT, THEY WILL BE AMAZED AT THE RESULTS.  I HOPE THAT THIS CREAM WILL ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE.</li>
    <li> I have looked for Satura creams everywhere in stores here on the Central Coast of CA. and can find it nowhere. Fortunately you had it listed. The shipment arrived as promised and the product is great. M.S.</li>
    <li> Gift for my Mom...She loves it.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY MANY MANY different creams (oh, if I had a dollar for each one...) from health food stores to expensive department stores.  I am 52 yrs old with fair, dry, very sensitive skin.  People are surprised, they think I&#x27;m much younger, even my doctor thought I was in my 30&#x27;s (he may have exagerated!).  I started having \\&quot;crinkles\\&quot; around the corners of my mouth about 1 1/2 yrs ago so I started using this cream about 1 yr ago and it has made a huge difference.  It is a little greasy, so I use just a little and add a couple drops of water to it once it&#x27;s on my skin, and it melts down into my skin.  I have recently started to add some Vit E oil to it in a seperate little container, and I believe that has made it even better.    It is a simple formula and it works great!</li>
    <li> I always get excellent service from Amazon; however, I was very disappointed in this product this time around.  I used Dorothy Gray&#x27;s Satura for many many years until it could no longer be purchased in the stores.  Whoever took it over changed the ingredients and it&#x27;s nothing like it used to be.  Now it&#x27;s like falling face first into an oil slick.</li>
    <li> I worked for Lancôme and Clarins and tried every dept store line. This beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;Great price - save your money for Dior cosmetics instead of high price crèmes!</li>
    <li> My mother introduced me to this product many years ago. It was a wonderful face cream but was having a hard time finding it until amazon offered it. But it&#x27;s not the same at all. It&#x27;s greasy and just over all not a good product anymore. I was so sad when I got my first jar on Amazon because I thought I would never run out again. But as it turns out I am going to have to find something else. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Used this product for 50 years.  They have changed it and it&#x27;s terrible.  May as well use lard or crisco on your face.  Couldn&#x27;t be any greasier than this stuff.</li>
    <li> SATURA BASIC FORMULA HAS BEEN MY FACE TREATMENT FOR AT LEAST 20 YEARS, AND ALSO ALL MY SISTERS AND MOTHER. I WOULD NOT CHANGE  THIS CREAM, BECAUSE MY SKIN WILL LET ME KNOW INMEDIATLY. ,IT FILLS ALL MY EXPECTATIONS AND IT KEEPS MY SKIN MOIST AND SOFT, AND I USE IT DAY AND NIGHT , YOU&#x27;ll NEED SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT EVERY TIME THAT YOU APPLY IT ON YOUR FACE, ITS LAST FOR EVER, THE WAY A APPLY IT, IS WITH MY FINGERS TIPS AND TOPPING it ALL AROUND FACE AND NECK, I RECOMEND SATURA BASIC FORMULA FOR A DRY AND MATURE SKYN, AND FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH DRY SKIN, WILL BE SMART TO START NOW, LIKE MY MOM, IT SHOW THE CARE THAT SHE TOOK USING SATURA, EVERYBODY ADMIRED HER GORGEOUS SKIN, AND I THINK I AM GOING HER WAY BECAUSE PEOPLE ASK ME CONSTANTLY WHAT CREAM DO I USE, &amp;#34; S A T U R A &amp;#34; OF COURSE.&lt;br /&gt;ANY WAYS I AM PROUD AND THANKFUL FOR USING THIS MARVELOUS CRAM.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU DOROTHY GRAY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M.CECILIA MALACHOWSKY</li>
    <li> Used this product for many years and find it to serve my needs perfectly. Always recomend it to people when asked about it and let the know where I get it..</li>
    <li> My grandmother used this 40 years ago, and I have been using it for 20 years, I use to buy it at Walgreens, I cann&#x27;t find it there any more.  My skin is very dry and this cream is wonderful</li>
    <li> Got this for my elderly aunt who had used this since the 1950s and Amazon is the only place who still sold it.  Thank you!  You made her very happy. By the way, it must work.  Her skin is flawless at 87.</li>
