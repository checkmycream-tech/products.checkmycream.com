      <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made inside and out and</li>
      <li>However when i started putting all my make up in the case, everything barley fit.</li>
      <li>The top drawer inside does not slide in and out very well</li>
      <li>I am sure a well built case for real travel would be in the hundreds.</li>
      <li>Lovely and very sturdy with being heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love my new makeup kit..</li>
      <li>; can&#x27;t fit my bracelets as I was able to with the last one.</li>

      <li>Its very spacious and has compartments for all of my makeup, face, eye, lips, brows....</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really have any gripes, besides the deepness of the drawers</li>
      <li>but the doors does hold my eyeliner pencils very well, so</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very functionable.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect it to be high quallity</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 16yr old daughter for Christmas</li>
      <li>My only complaint would be the two drawers because they don&#x27;t slide easily.</li>

<li> My only complaint would be the two drawers because they don&#x27;t slide easily.</li>
<li> but you can only fit small ones, which is a down fall.</li>
<li> Hand-held case came in less than 5 days, new and fully packaged as promised.</li>
<li> the only down fall is</li>
<li> just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
<li> the inside ain&#x27;t big enough to hold hardly anything</li>
<li> Not really a make up person</li>
<li> Has 2 drawers, a mirror, and two small fold out trays with a larger tray under them.  </li>
<li> The mirror is pretty useless, but I don&#x27;t need it anyway.  </li>
<li> The case is lined with a velvet material, which makeup sticks to and makes it impossible to clean.  </li>
<li> I used sheet protectors and cut them down to size and lined each section for easier cleanup.  </li>
<li> The only complaint she has is the drawers slide out a little slow.</li>
<li> I usually have to search the dresser for them.</li>
<li> but you have to give it at least one in order to post a review.</li>
<li> Too small!</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Shallow drawers, Not made for travel</li>
<li> The bottom drawer is just about impossible to open without tearing the material.  </li>
<li> Not the sturdiest and not good for travel.</li>
<li> I thought it may look dinky and be poorly constructed, but I was so wrong.  </li>
<li> and I was needing another one, but this case was the wrong one to buy.</li>

    <li> Hand-held case came in less than 5 days, new and fully packaged as promised. Love the brush station on the inside of each door, which was a surprise. :)</li>
    <li> My daughter recently joined a competitive dance team, we need something to carry all of her make up in that would be sturdy. We have traveled with this case and it has held up beautifully. She likes all of the room and compartments to put everything in. The only complaint she has is the drawers slide out a little slow.</li>
    <li> I have owned several makeup cases, but this one is awesome.  I thought it may look dinky and be poorly constructed, but I was so wrong.  The design is made of like vinyl, and it holds 8 brushes in it side doors.  Has 2 drawers, a mirror, and two small fold out trays with a larger tray under them.  Lovely and very sturdy with being heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Mrs.</li>
    <li> I love my new makeup kit.. Its very spacious and has compartments for all of my makeup, face, eye, lips, brows.... lord knows I have a lot of makeup and this is a great carrying case for all of it! highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to hold my nail enhancement products so they wouldn&#x27;t be an eyesore on my desk. This will stay neatly tucked away until I need to do a nail application from home. This is the perfect size for my purposes, but I will most likely be getting another one (probably in leopard) to hold my acrylic powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Cute, Affordable, Portable, Locking capability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Shallow drawers, Not made for travel</li>
    <li> Very cute for makeup.  Not the sturdiest and not good for travel. The case is lined with a velvet material, which makeup sticks to and makes it impossible to clean.  I used sheet protectors and cut them down to size and lined each section for easier cleanup.  The bottom drawer is just about impossible to open without tearing the material.  I store things I never use in that drawer.  The mirror is pretty useless, but I don&#x27;t need it anyway.  The inidividual holders for the brushes is a great feature.</li>
    <li> Its absolutely perfect. I love the design and the compartments. My only complaint would be the two drawers because they don&#x27;t slide easily.</li>
    <li> This is a great train case! I bought this for someone that is just starting out with makeup and they absolutely loved it! There is a great amount of space for all your cosmetics and products PLUS they loved the Jewelry space.&lt;br /&gt;I Would Definitely recommend to all makeup lover&#x27;s out there looking for an affordable &amp; adorable train case.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of the product was excellent and it arrived early!&lt;br /&gt;The Gift Receiver LOVED IT!! :)</li>
    <li> Definitely not for makeup! Too small!</li>
    <li> Hubby got for me to put my make up and stuff in, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Very good purchase!</li>
    <li> I have four cases and I was needing another one, but this case was the wrong one to buy. It&#x27;s cheaply made inside and out and the inside ain&#x27;t big enough to hold hardly anything and when I contacted the company to return it they told me not only did I have to pay to return it but there&#x27;s a 10% restocking fee, so if you order this, which I very very highly don&#x27;t recommend you better make sure it&#x27;s what you want cause if not youre gonna be stuck with it unless you want to pay for them to take it back. I wouldn&#x27;t give this case any stars but you have to give it at least one in order to post a review.</li>
    <li> This was bought for a step daughters 13 birthday, I am sure she will love it. However if this was to be really used for travel I would not expect it to hold up for than maybe one trip at best. It is more decrotive, which is what I bought it for since her room is in Zebra print materials. The top drawer inside does not slide in and out very well, you get what you pay for. I am sure a well built case for real travel would be in the hundreds.</li>
    <li> When i bought this i thought it would be big enough for all my make up. However when i started putting all my make up in the case, everything barley fit. I love it just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> This case was the perfect size to hold all my daughter&#x27;s dance recital makeup.  Kept everything neat and organized through 6 costume changes.</li>
    <li> I wanted this because of the zebra print so I didn&#x27;t expect it to be high quallity but i was impressed with what i got</li>
    <li> Love this product. Would suggest for anyone to use for jewelry or makeup.  Many compliments.  The item was exactly as described and was packed securly so no damage could be done.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item about 1 month ago. I love the product the only down fall is the bottom draw gets caught and I have issues opening it also on the side open doors they have a place to put your makeup brushes but you can only fit small ones, which is a down fall.</li>
    <li> The case is very nice. It replaced one I had for seven years, so I&#x27;m hoping this one can take as good a licking as that one. Don&#x27;t really have any gripes, besides the deepness of the drawers; can&#x27;t fit my bracelets as I was able to with the last one. I love the print and it&#x27;s very functionable. Not really a make up person but the doors does hold my eyeliner pencils very well, so that&#x27;s another thumbs up. I usually have to search the dresser for them. Well, if your looking to purchase, I say, give it a go, it is a nice caboodle.</li>
    <li> Love this case.Its a Christmas gift for my grandaughter.Very sturdy and pretty.Shipping was very fast.Thank you so much.Would order again.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girl friend to store her beauty stuffs when traveling.  She loves it!  Nice mirror on the inside too.</li>
    <li> I love my case!  It locks, and has plenty of space for my make up.  Stores quite nicely under the sink and the zebra is just great!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful case, looks better than the picture.</li>
    <li> It has everything I need, good space for all the makeup that I need to carry with me and brushes.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 16yr old daughter for Christmas and I think she will love it!! Not too small or too big, just perfect size!!</li>
    <li> Every girl should have one of these!</li>
    <li> granddaughter loves it,,,uses it for her dance stuff...</li>
