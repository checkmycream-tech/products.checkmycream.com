### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product and service</li>
      <li>Best Shampoo and conditioner ever!!!</li>
      <li>The best thing I can say for this shampoo/conditioner set is that they smell great.</li>
      <li>the smell of it was just great</li>
      <li>It also works great for color-treated hair.</li>
      <li>good price, great stuff</li>
      <li>The shampoo feels great in my hair and it feels clean and wonderful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That is how freaking good this stuff smells.</li>
      <li>Product and price are good</li>
      <li>Smells great and gets my hair clean!</li>
      <li>I love the Aveda Shampure!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ally used this Product love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps when I&#x27;m a wealthy Sheik Princess of my own Fiefdom... or something... I will buy this in jugs and pour it gleefully over my head.</li>
      <li>Good product, arrive in a timely manner and is the original product.</li>
      <li>That said, I will be sure to try another Aveda &#x27;scalp treatment&#x27; product to avoid this from happening.</li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo and conditioner....</li>
      <li>I bought myself the Bumble and Bumble Coco shampoo and conditioner which I love.</li>
      <li>I just love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>but I love the smell and effect on my hair.</li>
      <li>I love using this shampoo in the morning because I think it helps wake me up with its authentic smell.</li>
      <li>Shampure is my favorite shampoo and conditioner ever.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a clarifying shampoo.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more from Aveda.  </li>
      <li>This wonderful stumble happened when all I did was put the pomade throughout my hair.</li>
      <li>To be fair, that&#x27;s what most Aveda products do to my hair, but the Shampure in particular.</li>
      <li>I love the way Shampure makes my hair feel- light and buoyant, but it&#x27;s a disaster for my scalp.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t cause me to have a dry scalp at all, like some reviews experienced, and paired with the shampure conditioner, my hair feels amazing and wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells so fresh and clean and leaves my hair feeling soft and perfect.</li>
      <li>I have below the shoulders wavy hair that is medium to slightly fine, and gets curly if not blow-dried.</li>
      <li>The problem is that I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>The aroma and the promise of healthy hair is exactly what this product has done for me!</li>
      <li>a lavender bath, shampoo this is in, and enjoy the heavenly scent for a while as you bask in the bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s crazy-expensive, and also is very, very strong, so I don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
      <li>From the first moment I used these two products, I fell in love.</li>
      <li>Your hair will feel clean and nourished.</li>
      <li>leaves one&#x27;s hair clean and with body.  </li>
      <li>My absolute favorite product ever.</li>
      <li>The shampoo was OK, but the condition was really inferior.</li>
      <li>What is so great about these products is that they are natural and there are no harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is natural and smells so clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing, although that is not enough for me.  </li>
      <li>is not so good as i expected</li>
      <li>I had relaxed hair (ethnic) at the time and was in a desert climate when I first tried them.     </li>
      <li>The home site offers free shipping and a lower price for the product.</li>
      <li>I should have tried it first before I ordered it online.</li>
      <li>My hair felt so soft and clean.</li>
      <li>this leaves my hair so clean feels so soft</li>
      <li>The smell is intoxicating and really eases your mind when you use them.</li>
      <li>It really locks in moisture and make your hair easier to manage.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend anything by Aveda!</li>
      <li>Just know that there will be a lovely plant aroma when you use, so if you don&#x27;t like shampoos that leave a terrific smell that will last for days, then do not buy.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Aveda products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always nice to save a little money on things that truly work!!</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone just a bit expensive but it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>and I had no idea it would create such pretty waves and curls in my hair.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and it is light enough for my thin hair</li>
      <li>However, wish I&#x27;d known I could buy this directly from Aveda.</li>
      <li>My hair was so soft and</li>
      <li>This seller marked it up a generous $12, and when I tried to return I was told it takes 30 days (1) to process the refund.  </li>
      <li>I realized that even while my hair was relaxed, when I would do this regime my hair would curl naturally.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much too drying for my already dry scalp</li>
      <li>Just a little background on me: I first purchased the Shampure Shampoo and Conditioner about 4 years ago.</li>

<li> Just a little background on me: I first purchased the Shampure Shampoo and Conditioner about 4 years ago.</li>
<li> Normally I have no difficulty straightening my hair, even with this shampoo and conditioner, but my hair immediately frizzes and turns into a wavy tangled mess within an hour of washing my hair with these products.</li>
<li> Since I shampoo almost every day, it goes a long way.</li>
<li> After I washed and conditioned, I would towel dry and immediately put the Humectant Pomade on while hair is still damp.</li>
<li> Allow your hair to air dry and the smell just follows you for days.</li>
<li> so a moisturizing product weighs it down.</li>
<li> so it doesn&#x27;t waeigh it down.</li>
<li> Dried my hair and scalp.</li>
<li> usually wash my hair with the shampoo all the way through, then wring out my hair, then I apply about half a tablespoon of conditioner</li>
<li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair look like broom straw: thin, limp, without shine or body, and yet tangled and impossible to keep straight.</li>
<li> At least that&#x27;s what I tell myself, because I&#x27;m not a robber-baroness, arms trader or hedge fund</li>
<li> Otherwise, the horrible look of my hair plus the high price clearly makes it impossible for me to recommend this product.</li>
<li> Sad I wasted my money on the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
<li> Expensive stuff</li>
<li> No, that would just be wrong.</li>
<li> I went on a date with a guy who shampooed with this, and I was like \\&quot;Dude, your hair smells like flowers.\\&quot; :(  </li>
<li> You will not be disappointed if you give these a try.</li>
<li> Expensive, but works wonders on my hair!!</li>
<li> conclude that this shampoo is made from the tears of hysterically laughing angels riding unicorns as they prance over rainbows with kittens in their arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
<li> It smells terrible and maybe it is just me</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just a little background on me: I first purchased the Shampure Shampoo and Conditioner about 4 years ago. I had relaxed hair (ethnic) at the time and was in a desert climate when I first tried them.     From the first moment I used these two products, I fell in love. The smell is intoxicating and really eases your mind when you use them. My hair felt so soft and clean. I coupled these products with Aveda Humectant Pomade and the results did not disappoint.     After I washed and conditioned, I would towel dry and immediately put the Humectant Pomade on while hair is still damp. It really locks in moisture and make your hair easier to manage. Allow your hair to air dry and the smell just follows you for days. I realized that even while my hair was relaxed, when I would do this regime my hair would curl naturally. I looked as though I just got a curly perm and I had no idea it would create such pretty waves and curls in my hair. This wonderful stumble happened when all I did was put the pomade throughout my hair. I didn&#x27;t comb or brush it and the curls appeared. Not to mention the pomade compliments the shampure smell.    What is so great about these products is that they are natural and there are no harsh chemicals. Your hair will feel clean and nourished. I highly recommend Aveda products. You will not be disappointed if you give these a try. Just know that there will be a lovely plant aroma when you use, so if you don&#x27;t like shampoos that leave a terrific smell that will last for days, then do not buy.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner made my hair fee like straw.  The smell is amazing, although that is not enough for me.  I was expecting more from Aveda.  Sad I wasted my money on the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always nice to save a little money on things that truly work!!</li>
    <li> this leaves my hair so clean feels so soft</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> Product and price are good but it took a week to be delivered.</li>
    <li> Worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Dried my hair and scalp. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I buy this at the salon every chance I get. I love the way it smells and it is light enough for my thin hair so it doesn&#x27;t waeigh it down. It also works great for color-treated hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> is not so good as i expected</li>
    <li> Fragrance to soapy a smell.. Do not like this.</li>
    <li> I just got this at the salon to try out. It smells terrible and maybe it is just me but I seemed to have an allergic reaction to it. I bought myself the Bumble and Bumble Coco shampoo and conditioner which I love. I should have tried it first before I ordered it online.</li>
    <li> I love the Aveda Shampure!</li>
    <li> What can I say Aveda is always Aveda.</li>
    <li> Bought this product without checking the price.  Shampure and conditioner are each proced at $12 at the Aveda web site.  This seller marked it up a generous $12, and when I tried to return I was told it takes 30 days (1) to process the refund.  Watch out for this seller.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gets my hair clean!</li>
    <li> Aromatherapy in your shower!</li>
    <li> I just love this shampoo. It smells so fresh and clean and leaves my hair feeling soft and perfect. Best Shampoo and conditioner ever!!!</li>
    <li> This smells so amaze-a-mo-tating, I save it for days when I need some stress relief. I put it on in the bath tub and just lay there. It&#x27;s crazy-expensive, and also is very, very strong, so I don&#x27;t use it very often. It&#x27;s more of a clarifying shampoo. At least that&#x27;s what I tell myself, because I&#x27;m not a robber-baroness, arms trader or hedge fund manager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps when I&#x27;m a wealthy Sheik Princess of my own Fiefdom... or something... I will buy this in jugs and pour it gleefully over my head. No, that would just be wrong. Some things should just be savored, and if you do not savor them, you are a philistine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I conclude that this shampoo is made from the tears of hysterically laughing angels riding unicorns as they prance over rainbows with kittens in their arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is how freaking good this stuff smells. Ohhhhhhh, yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a lavender bath, shampoo this is in, and enjoy the heavenly scent for a while as you bask in the bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mama like-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE TO GUYS: Don&#x27;t use this if you&#x27;re a metrosexual. I went on a date with a guy who shampooed with this, and I was like \\&quot;Dude, your hair smells like flowers.\\&quot; :(  Stick to the men&#x27;s line. I bet it smells like pine cones &amp; mountainous forests.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair look like broom straw: thin, limp, without shine or body, and yet tangled and impossible to keep straight. I have below the shoulders wavy hair that is medium to slightly fine, and gets curly if not blow-dried. Normally I have no difficulty straightening my hair, even with this shampoo and conditioner, but my hair immediately frizzes and turns into a wavy tangled mess within an hour of washing my hair with these products. To be fair, that&#x27;s what most Aveda products do to my hair, but the Shampure in particular. The best thing I can say for this shampoo/conditioner set is that they smell great. Otherwise, the horrible look of my hair plus the high price clearly makes it impossible for me to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but works wonders on my hair!!</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner....leaves one&#x27;s hair clean and with body.  Since I shampoo almost every day, it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> good price, great stuff</li>
    <li> Way over priced. Didnt care for the smell</li>
    <li> My hair was so soft and the smell of it was just great</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite product ever. Fastest shipping I&#x27;ve seen too!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ally used this Product love it! I would recommend it to anyone just a bit expensive but it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Expensive stuff but I love the smell and effect on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the way Shampure makes my hair feel- light and buoyant, but it&#x27;s a disaster for my scalp. It&#x27;s much too drying for my already dry scalp and I&#x27;m left with a severely flakey head of hair. The problem is that I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine so a moisturizing product weighs it down. Shampure definitely &#x27;lifts&#x27; my hair up, but for those who are dry-skinned, it may seem like you have dandruff while using it. That said, I will be sure to try another Aveda &#x27;scalp treatment&#x27; product to avoid this from happening.</li>
    <li> The aroma and the promise of healthy hair is exactly what this product has done for me!</li>
    <li> I read a review on this shampoo, so decided to try both.  The shampoo was OK, but the condition was really inferior.</li>
    <li> Shampure is my favorite shampoo and conditioner ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is natural and smells so clean and refreshing. I love using this shampoo in the morning because I think it helps wake me up with its authentic smell. The shampoo feels great in my hair and it feels clean and wonderful. This doesn&#x27;t cause me to have a dry scalp at all, like some reviews experienced, and paired with the shampure conditioner, my hair feels amazing and wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my hair with the shampoo all the way through, then wring out my hair, then I apply about half a tablespoon of conditioner and I let it sit in my hair for about 5 minutes while I wash the rest of me before rinsing my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, my boyfriend loves my hair using this  :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Good product, arrive in a timely manner and is the original product. However, wish I&#x27;d known I could buy this directly from Aveda. The home site offers free shipping and a lower price for the product. Highly recommend anything by Aveda!</li>
