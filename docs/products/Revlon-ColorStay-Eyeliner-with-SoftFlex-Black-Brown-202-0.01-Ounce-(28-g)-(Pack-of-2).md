      <li>but I suppose it&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>have not had this kind of problem before.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Revlon ColorStay Eyeliner for more that 10 years and still love it!</li>
      <li>I always buy this one, and the price can vary WILDLY, so it is good to buy cheap when you see it</li>

      <li>I will for sure buy this product from now on.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this eye liner.  </li>
      <li>What more do you want out of an eyeliner??  </li>
      <li>The black-brown color is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Then another chip came off the top.  </li>
      <li>Always my favorite eyeliner.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite eyeliner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, just OK.</li>
      <li>I REALLY love this eyeliner, it is easily applied, and never smudges.  </li>
      <li>This is great as it does last and is very easy to work with</li>
      <li>Gel eyeliners work great, but, they dry out and are kind of a hassle.  </li>
      <li>So easy to put on and doesn&#x27;t vanish within minutes.</li>
      <li>isn&#x27;t waterproof but definitely easy to apply</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s waterproof, but easy to remove with makeup remover.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, can be smudged somewhat easily, and doesn&#x27;t melt off during the day.</li>
      <li>great product, this is the only eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t bleed all over my bottom lid half way through the day. :D</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smear all over my eyelid.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply, too.</li>
      <li>so I lost use of a significant part of the product.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and is great for tight lining and lining your waterline.</li>
      <li>and it is a great color for me, solid but not too intense.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product as it is truly long-lasting, the colors offered are &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; and the price is more reasonable than the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; brands out there!!.  </li>
      <li>I tried everything from Lancôme to Clinique to Maybelline without success.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite eyeliner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s waterproof so it lasts the entire day, and you only need to apply it once, which is great.</li>
      <li>Applies good but is hard to keep sharpened and easily falls apart when trying to use sharpener attached to it.&lt;br /&gt;Great for smudgy look when doing eyeliner not so much for precision lines.</li>
      <li>Reliable, smooth application, always sharp, convenient to carry in a purse - my favorite eyeliner for years.  </li>
      <li>The eyeliner stick crumbled on my first use</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe that I am able to order my favorite eyeliner at such a low price and have it delivered to me so promptly!</li>
      <li>love that I don&#x27;t have to apply often--once is usually enough for the whole day.</li>
      <li>Stays on a really long time and does not flake like most liquid liners.</li>
      <li>liner is okay, not significantly different than most other liners I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic tube that it comes in, however, is flimsy.  </li>
      <li>makes my eyes pop and stays on really well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this cosmetic!</li>
      <li>Also, because the now-taped tube isn&#x27;t as tight as originally designed, the wand (?) of color slides up freely, so I envision the possibility of it breaking off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This particular color is excellent for those of us whose skin tone and eye color are to soft for a harsh black.</li>
      <li>It goes on really smooth making it look more like a pen mark than a broken pencil mark.  </li>
      <li>However, at thirty-something it is important to me that my eyeliner goes on smooth, with no pushing and pulling of the delicate eye tissue.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product, since I&#x27;d much rather have to use remover to get it off than to have it running all down my face after a few hours.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Very dry, does not go on smooth.  </li>
      <li>I live in Texas where everything smudges.</li>
      <li>The pencils are convenient, but some are too soft and smudge, others are too hard and don&#x27;t apply well, and still others work but cost $20 or more.  </li>
      <li>Liner is too soft to sharpen and keep point.  </li>
      <li>I need eye makeup remover to get it completely off at night.</li>
      <li>I wear contacts, and find that my eyes tear up and run frequently.  </li>
      <li>Once you apply it and let it sit for even a few seconds, it pretty much does NOT rub off, not even if your hand slipped and you want to start over.</li>
      <li>It wont smudge onto your upper eyelid like a normal pencil does.</li>
      <li>The liner breaks in the sharpener which then is hard to clean out.  </li>
      <li>And the part that&#x27;s remaining is very old and dry.</li>
      <li>I love the Black-brown because I find the black a little harsh for my older eyes.  </li>

<li> But if you need to, there is a little tiny sharpener at the end of the pencil.  </li>
<li> Really no fuss.</li>
<li> Just use a hairspray you can empty into another container and use a brush to apply.</li>
<li> I have bought this in the past at the store and it lasted me several months.</li>
<li> Tried other eye pencils but no one stays as the Revlon one does.</li>
<li> You can also use hairspray to seal when used as an eyeliner, but you needed to be VERY careful not to get the hairspray in your eyes.</li>
<li> I got the black brown</li>
<li> it would also break, this product lasted less than one month.  </li>
<li> Even though the color says black brown, it is basically black.</li>
<li> not good for inner eye lid.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s a disaster to sharpen the thing. It&#x27;s OK, just OK. It works great until you need to sharpen  it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product. It stays on, but smugges.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner stays put. It doesn&#x27;t smear or fade during the day. I need eye makeup remover to get it completely off at night.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this eye liner.  Will never buy another brand or color.  No smudges, no runs, nothing.  Sometimes its still on the next morning, just the way I drew it in.</li>
    <li> Always my favorite eyeliner. Stays on the longest. Sometimes I re-apply but usually lasts all day! Great color, easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Applies good but is hard to keep sharpened and easily falls apart when trying to use sharpener attached to it.&lt;br /&gt;Great for smudgy look when doing eyeliner not so much for precision lines.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on eyeliners.  I don&#x27;t like the liquids on me because they seem too harsh.  Gel eyeliners work great, but, they dry out and are kind of a hassle.  You need to buy a nice brush and wash out your brush every time.  The pencils are convenient, but some are too soft and smudge, others are too hard and don&#x27;t apply well, and still others work but cost $20 or more.  This pencil is a staple in my makeup arsenal.  It comes in great colors and the price is right.  The pencil is self-sharpening so you don&#x27;t waste time or product sharpening it.  But if you need to, there is a little tiny sharpener at the end of the pencil.  My teen daughter loves the black.  I love the Black-brown because I find the black a little harsh for my older eyes.  It is good for tightlining the eyes as well.  I hope they never stop making this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Revlon ColorStay Eyeliner for more that 10 years and still love it! Tried other eye pencils but no one stays as the Revlon one does. I am just sorry I cannot find it in Switzerland or Italy.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner pencil I&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on smoothly, can be smudged somewhat easily, and doesn&#x27;t melt off during the day. I like that I don&#x27;t have to sharpen it, just twist to get more pencil. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>

    <li> I think Revlon ColorStay is an exceptional product at a resonable price!!  I am very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> great product, this is the only eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t bleed all over my bottom lid half way through the day. :D</li>
    <li> Smudges a lot. Three hours after wearing makeup I become a panda.</li>
    <li> This item is old and in bad condition. The eyeliner stick crumbled on my first use so I lost use of a significant part of the product. And the part that&#x27;s remaining is very old and dry. I feel I got ripped off.</li>
    <li> not good for inner eye lid. smears everywhere</li>
    <li> I have been using Revlon SoftFlex for a while now.  When I was 18, I didn&#x27;t think twice about pushing and pulling my eye to apply liner.  However, at thirty-something it is important to me that my eyeliner goes on smooth, with no pushing and pulling of the delicate eye tissue.  Revlon SoftFlex does just that.  This particular color is excellent for those of us whose skin tone and eye color are to soft for a harsh black.</li>
    <li> Had this for about a week until it all broke off and I was unable to use it anymore.  I have bought this in the past at the store and it lasted me several months. This product they&#x27;re selling must be old and defective or something, it was a just a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Even though the color says black brown, it is basically black. It is still great, though. It&#x27;s waterproof so it lasts the entire day, and you only need to apply it once, which is great. It wont smudge onto your upper eyelid like a normal pencil does. It&#x27;s super easy to apply, too. Definitely a good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Cheap, great eyeliner.  I always buy this one, and the price can vary WILDLY, so it is good to buy cheap when you see it</li>
    <li> Very dry, does not go on smooth.  BUT it does last.  Give &amp; take.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item twice and was unsatisfied, the liner would constantly break and when I used the auto sharpener it would also break, this product lasted less than one month.  I will never try it again.  I had never had that problem when I purchased it locally.</li>
    <li> good stuff!!! love that I don&#x27;t have to apply often--once is usually enough for the whole day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner for years and it still amazes me how long it lasts. Once you apply it and let it sit for even a few seconds, it pretty much does NOT rub off, not even if your hand slipped and you want to start over. You have to use make-up remover. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product, since I&#x27;d much rather have to use remover to get it off than to have it running all down my face after a few hours.</li>
    <li> isn&#x27;t waterproof but definitely easy to apply</li>
    <li> Flaky and difficult to apply.  Ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite eyeliner. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smear all over my eyelid. I&#x27;m definitely hooked and will continue to purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner. I use it to do my brows also. Stays on a really long time and does not flake like most liquid liners. Hint: When I use for my eyebrows I seal it with a low cost hairspray. Just use a hairspray you can empty into another container and use a brush to apply. You can also use hairspray to seal when used as an eyeliner, but you needed to be VERY careful not to get the hairspray in your eyes. No dripping from the brush. GREAT price on Amazon!!! I pay almost $9.00 at my drugstore for one eyeliner.</li>
    <li> So easy to put on and doesn&#x27;t vanish within minutes. It says it&#x27;s waterproof and it actually is. It comes off easily enough if you need to remove it, but it also lasts the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a little sharpener that I never use but I suppose it&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Great product! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I always end up with smears of it on my bottom eye, without any rubbing. But it&#x27;s nice I suppose.</li>
    <li> 2.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The liner is okay, not significantly different than most other liners I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic tube that it comes in, however, is flimsy.  It&#x27;s not like I drop rocks into my makeup drawer, so I was surprised when a little plastic chip came out of the tube before I&#x27;d finished my previous liner.  Then another chip came off the top.  In order to keep the thing together I wrapped both ends with Scotch tape.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I threw away the end that&#x27;s just a sharpener or whatever because it would clatter to the floor or into the sink as I was using the business end.  Also, because the now-taped tube isn&#x27;t as tight as originally designed, the wand (?) of color slides up freely, so I envision the possibility of it breaking off.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had this kind of problem before.  I&#x27;ll not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.. no smudging after all day, and does a nice fine line. I put it on my bottom eyelid.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner, lasts forever, easy to apply.  What more do you want out of an eyeliner??  And the stick seems to last a long time also.  My bottom eyelid was tattooed a long time ago with a line......and this eyeliner seems to last even longer because of that.  I also don&#x27;t believe in removing eye makeup at all.  The rubbing is too much for the delicate eye area, in my opinion.   I&#x27;ve been doing this for 50 years and it seems to be working for me.  This is a great eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I put this on in the morning, work all day, go to the gym and it stays on! Really no fuss.</li>
    <li> Reliable, smooth application, always sharp, convenient to carry in a purse - my favorite eyeliner for years.  I hope it never changes.</li>
    <li> Stays put all day. Goes on smoothly and is great for tight lining and lining your waterline. I have used this for years! #1 drugstore eyeliner in my opinion. The black-brown color is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I REALLY love this eyeliner, it is easily applied, and never smudges.  I wear contacts, and find that my eyes tear up and run frequently.  This product is great, being that it&#x27;s waterproof and doesn&#x27;t run.  I highly recommend this cosmetic!</li>
    <li> My eye make up seems to fade and run; it was difficult to find a product that goes on well with minimal effort that lasts. I tried everything from Lancôme to Clinique to Maybelline without success. I highly recommend this product as it is truly long-lasting, the colors offered are &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; and the price is more reasonable than the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; brands out there!!.  Great product</li>
    <li> Liner is too soft to sharpen and keep point.  The liner breaks in the sharpener which then is hard to clean out.  I tossed this after a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner! I live in Texas where everything smudges. Not this eyeliner. It&#x27;s waterproof, but easy to remove with makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I have very thin eye lashes and have been using this for years.  makes my eyes pop and stays on really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this liner for years, but recently became hip to the chemicals used in it.  I will not be ordering again.  If you don&#x27;t mind the chemicals, this is really a great waterproof liner.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I am able to order my favorite eyeliner at such a low price and have it delivered to me so promptly! Very great deal! : )</li>
