### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It was an awesome buy!</li>
      <li>It worked perfectly for my needs.</li>
      <li>This is a great concept.</li>
      <li>it is the best top coat on the market.</li>
      <li>but they are so easy to use and work great for nail art!</li>
      <li>The good part is with practice you to can become proficient at it as well.</li>
      <li>The products I&#x27;ve bought used to be good from the company</li>
      <li>the designs came out good.</li>
      <li>lol Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>you need a great top coat which MUST be used or your pen art</li>
      <li>I kid you not, my nail looked perfect when I finished, it cracked and faded almost right away.</li>
      <li>I will get more colors!</li>
      <li>I have never tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s top coat because Seche Vite to me will never be beat!</li>
      <li>I just love these pens for nail art!</li>
      <li>But for my intended purpose it is great and easy to use.</li>
      <li>price is nice and for the number of times we have painted our nails</li>
      <li>Start over, I repainted my nail, shook the pen really good, pressed it onto a piece of paper to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t bleed this time and it works</li>
      <li>fast!)To be honest</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail art pens are by far the best that I have used.</li>
      <li>When you try to put a top coat over it, it cracks and separates, kind of like Crackle polish does.</li>
      <li>Fun for girls to practice and play around at a great price.</li>
      <li>and I was able to get very fine lines out of it.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>you could just fill up with your favorite quality polish</li>
      <li>I also used sally Hansen light rose color for my manicure</li>
      <li>This was a much better result.</li>
      <li>Nail technicians have had many hours of practice, they have taken months or years to master the craft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For those of you that do buy it, here are some hints that might help you have a better experience than we did:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>but when I put the top coat over it it cracked all over.</li>
      <li>I have been licensed for many years and have done nails for over 20 years plus taught at a cosmetology school for as many...</li>
      <li>It was ok until I put top coat on.</li>
      <li>Cracks under top coat.</li>
      <li>More like a liquid powder that dries.  </li>
      <li>You have to put a top coat on it as it will rub off.</li>
      <li>Stayed on my nails for about a day even with a top coat.</li>
      <li>I can draw on them just like a pen, however, you have to seal it with a top coat or it washes off with water.</li>
      <li>I bought this pen for the sole purpose of making neat polka dots on top of my manicures/pedicures and it works great for that purpose.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>I had good luck with stars and stripes for July 4th toenails for myself and my S.O., and with a clear top coat (some Delore Nails Chip Proof that I&#x27;ve had around for years)</li>
      <li>After properly getting it started it works great for the dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Says \\&quot;great for French manicure,\\&quot; but looks like crayon scribble when it dries.</li>
      <li>It went on smooth.</li>
      <li>Works great, is really super white and is easy to handle and control as you use it.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much to get use to.  </li>
      <li>Others maybe who have had more practice and time to devote to this will maybe rate it higher.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive this item.</li>
      <li>If anyone has any recommendations on a nail polish good for french tips</li>
      <li>I then applied another layer of white and two more layers of top coat.</li>
      <li>Got it really quickly, too</li>
      <li>will crack peel or chip off quickly, my recommendation is Seche vite</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this product, I got it in three colors, because using a toothpick for fine detailing is very painstaking.</li>
      <li>people who complain that these pens smudge off instantly - YOU NEED TO USE A TOP COAT!</li>
      <li>Make sure you let the dots/art completely dry before doing a top coat</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a &#x27;fun&#x27; item, a novelty, and I&#x27;m not expecting salon results.</li>
      <li>Just fun.</li>
      <li>we thought this might be fun to play with once or twice.</li>
      <li>so if I want anything to stay on my hands it must have a clear top coat.</li>
      <li>This is fun and works well for nail.  </li>
      <li>Try not to get it on your skin too because it won&#x27;t come off with acetone or nail polish remover right away.</li>
      <li>This little pen is so amazing!</li>
      <li>and so you can make dots easily but not small lines.</li>
      <li>I thought I could live with it and eventually put the top coat on but by the end of the evening I took it off because the cracking bothered me too much.  </li>
      <li>I found the pen easy to work with, it lets out just the right amount of polish, glides smoothly, and was fairly easy to get professional looking designs and french tips.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;s able to draw cute little designs on her nails.</li>
      <li>once, I painted my nails, then applied the pen to resemble french tips, then did a top coat.</li>
      <li>Do not put it on your nail first.</li>
      <li>THANKS!</li>
      <li>your advice/feedback would be highly appreciated!</li>
      <li>My daughter and I will most likely buy nail art pens again but not these.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather use white polish with super fine brush.</li>
      <li>It was so prominent, I went back and reread the packaging wondering if I had bought a crackle polish pen.</li>
      <li>The pen is easy to use and IS excellent for fine detailing, but I put it on at night, left my hands out of commission for hours to let it dry, went to bed, and when I got up in the morning the intricate damask pattern I had worked so hard on was smudged!</li>
      <li>First- of all you must have dry nails free from any oils lotions or most obvious water..</li>
      <li>The marks are in the exact same place as the original design.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>own white, turquoise, black, hot pink &amp; love them all!  </li>
      <li>A three because the pen worked, you can make dots with it, and it might be fun for a young preteen to play around with at home sometime or at a slumber party.</li>
      <li>I was really dissapointed though when that did not happen.</li>
      <li>Really, you should always use one to protect your nail polish anyway</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest using it on a natural (unpolished) nail first if you&#x27;re going for this look and then applying a clear/light polish after.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get the other colors! :)</li>
      <li>Very easy to use &amp; if you mess up you can actually just wife off and try again (if you wipe off right away).</li>
      <li>I will attach a photo to the main pictures of the day after applying.</li>
      <li>I bought this in Vegas and my friend and I applied it while drinking, so it&#x27;s not a serious thing.</li>
      <li>So I bought this item today at CVS thinking I would have a quick and effortless french manicure when I got home.</li>
      <li>I got my pen and was super stoked to try it, only to find it ended up bleeding all over my nail.</li>
      <li>It is a good idea that was poorly executed.</li>
      <li>This is quite a nice product, though it has the consistency of a black marker, not like regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>It seemed to dry quickly</li>
      <li>This product may work okay for white polka dots, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t work for a french manicure look.  </li>
      <li>Comclusion:  maybe good for toes that are too far from anyone&#x27;s face to see much detail, but sadly won&#x27;t fulfill my fingernail design desires.</li>
      <li>It goes on very unevenly and requires two or more coats.</li>
      <li>The product is fine for what I want to do with it, which is add little decorative touches to painted toenails.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised that all of the Sally Hansen nail art pens have bad reviews - I personally think these are the best nail art pens on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>When you put the pen on over the clear it has a cracked look to it.</li>
      <li>I really thought that this product would be helpful in creating French manicures.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this pen for french tips or any real designs (I tried a bit just to see and</li>
      <li>Do not expect a professional look.</li>
      <li>First I thought I didn&#x27;t let it dry well.</li>
      <li>The second time I applied the white pen first to look like french tips and then waited a long time for it to dry before putting on two top coats.</li>
      <li>You need to shake it well before using and press down hard on a piece of paper several times until the tip is really covered in paint, then do many test dots on the paper to really get it going.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the worst fingernail polish. It doesn&#x27;t even last 3 or 4 hours. The minute you wash your hands or shower most all of the polish cones off waste of money!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just bought one of these for a memorial service for one of my fathers&#x27; coworkers that got in a wreck and died. I was going to write his name on one of my nails, but when i tried to use it, it wouldnt even come out. The tip of the pen fell off and i shook it an nothing came out. Highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in this product. It went on smooth. Then once it dried on my tips it cracked and came off in spots. The flowers I put on totally faded. I will attach a photo to the main pictures of the day after applying. I kid you not, my nail looked perfect when I finished, it cracked and faded almost right away. I also used sally Hansen light rose color for my manicure and it took so long to dry completely. Almost 3 1/2 hours. It was ridiculous, what a disappointment and waste of time. I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy Sally Hansen again. The products I&#x27;ve bought used to be good from the company but lately they have been distributing low quality products. If anyone has any recommendations on a nail polish good for french tips your advice/feedback would be highly appreciated! THANKS!</li>
    <li> This is the last Sally Hansen product I will buy. After having trouble with several waxes and hair removal products I stupidly gave this a try. I bought the white. I only used it on my tips for a french manicure. While applying it it goes on unevenly. I applied two coats. It seemed to dry quickly but when I put the top coat over it it cracked all over. I then applied another layer of white and two more layers of top coat. They very next day it was chipping off of every single finger. The day after that (today) it was peeling off and cracking. I would only recommend you use this on your toe nails and only if youre not going to wash your feet for several days. I would not buy this product again if it was on clearance for one dollar.</li>
    <li> First- of all you must have dry nails free from any oils lotions or most obvious water..Second- you need a great top coat which MUST be used or your pen art will crack peel or chip off quickly, my recommendation is Seche vite it is the best top coat on the market.( found at Amazon also plus, it dries lightening fast!)To be honest I have never tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s top coat because Seche Vite to me will never be beat! Third- practice practice practice! Nail technicians have had many hours of practice, they have taken months or years to master the craft. The good part is with practice you to can become proficient at it as well. I have tried this product (plus zillions of others) Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail art pens are by far the best that I have used. I have been licensed for many years and have done nails for over 20 years plus taught at a cosmetology school for as many...</li>
    <li> Buy another product...huge waste of my money.  Wanted to make the tips for my French manicure...this horrible art pen rubbed of within minutes.</li>
    <li> This is fun and works well for nail.  You have to put a top coat on it as it will rub off.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product, I got it in three colors, because using a toothpick for fine detailing is very painstaking. The pen is easy to use and IS excellent for fine detailing, but I put it on at night, left my hands out of commission for hours to let it dry, went to bed, and when I got up in the morning the intricate damask pattern I had worked so hard on was smudged! Wish I hadn&#x27;t gotten the other shades. Wish there was some sort of nib pen or refillable pen you could just fill up with your favorite quality polish so you could just go to town with it and not worry about smearing. It is a good idea that was poorly executed.</li>
    <li> I really thought that this product would be helpful in creating French manicures. Unfortunately when you use it, they tell you not to use it on your nail without an under coat of clear. When you put the pen on over the clear it has a cracked look to it. I had to take all the polish off and start all over. I was not impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> The product is fine for what I want to do with it, which is add little decorative touches to painted toenails. I don&#x27;t think I could do the really fine-lined work shown in the Sally Hansen photos, and I&#x27;m not interested in the French manicure look so I won&#x27;t be trying that. I had good luck with stars and stripes for July 4th toenails for myself and my S.O., and with a clear top coat (some Delore Nails Chip Proof that I&#x27;ve had around for years) the designs were quite durable. I added a photo of his toes taken three weeks after they were painted; you can see the gap at the base of the nails where they&#x27;re growing out, and you can also see that the white designs held up well.</li>
    <li> Pricey, to start. It was $8 for the tube and I&#x27;m not sure how far that&#x27;ll go. I&#x27;ve tried it two ways: once, I painted my nails, then applied the pen to resemble french tips, then did a top coat. The white tips from the pen easily wiped off, and unless you wait a very long time for it to completely dry, the white ends up looking cracked. The second time I applied the white pen first to look like french tips and then waited a long time for it to dry before putting on two top coats. This was a much better result. I&#x27;d suggest using it on a natural (unpolished) nail first if you&#x27;re going for this look and then applying a clear/light polish after. For fancy designs you&#x27;d have to use a different process. It&#x27;s a &#x27;fun&#x27; item, a novelty, and I&#x27;m not expecting salon results. I bought this in Vegas and my friend and I applied it while drinking, so it&#x27;s not a serious thing. Just fun. The results are less than stellar, but lasted 2 days at least.</li>
    <li> I got my pen and was super stoked to try it, only to find it ended up bleeding all over my nail. Start over, I repainted my nail, shook the pen really good, pressed it onto a piece of paper to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t bleed this time and it works okay. I had to keep reapplying it, and after the 4 application, i finally had a solid white line. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this pen again.</li>
    <li> Works great, is really super white and is easy to handle and control as you use it. Got it really quickly, too</li>
    <li> This is a great concept. My daughter and I will most likely buy nail art pens again but not these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is nice and for the number of times we have painted our nails we thought this might be fun to play with once or twice. So we bought it and played with it and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that do buy it, here are some hints that might help you have a better experience than we did:&lt;br /&gt;1. You must shake it a lot. Do a little bit of nail art and shake it, do a little bit more and shake it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Do not expect a professional look. The tip is thick and so you can make dots easily but not small lines. And sometimes it had an uneven look.&lt;br /&gt;3. Do not put it on your nail first. Get something to try it on every time you shake it so that you don&#x27;t ruin your nail.&lt;br /&gt;4. Don&#x27;t push too hard and don&#x27;t push too light. If you push too hard too much of the paint will come out. If you don&#x27;t push enough then nothing will come out and it will scratch your paint off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least that was our experience. Others maybe who have had more practice and time to devote to this will maybe rate it higher. But I&#x27;d rate this as a three. A three because the pen worked, you can make dots with it, and it might be fun for a young preteen to play around with at home sometime or at a slumber party. But that is about all.</li>
    <li> I found the pen easy to work with, it lets out just the right amount of polish, glides smoothly, and was fairly easy to get professional looking designs and french tips.  The problem is that as soon as it started drying, the paint started to crackle.  The longer it dried, the worse it got.  I thought I could live with it and eventually put the top coat on but by the end of the evening I took it off because the cracking bothered me too much.  It was so prominent, I went back and reread the packaging wondering if I had bought a crackle polish pen. Comclusion:  maybe good for toes that are too far from anyone&#x27;s face to see much detail, but sadly won&#x27;t fulfill my fingernail design desires.</li>
    <li> I bought this pen for the sole purpose of making neat polka dots on top of my manicures/pedicures and it works great for that purpose. You need to shake it well before using and press down hard on a piece of paper several times until the tip is really covered in paint, then do many test dots on the paper to really get it going. This is because after it sits for a while it can be watery and the paint is not fully in the tip. After properly getting it started it works great for the dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who complain that these pens smudge off instantly - YOU NEED TO USE A TOP COAT! Really, you should always use one to protect your nail polish anyway and I work with kids and am constantly washing my hands and cleaning things so if I want anything to stay on my hands it must have a clear top coat. I use Sally Hansen Hard as Nails for the top coat which kept the dots firmly in place on my nails for 6-7 days. Make sure you let the dots/art completely dry before doing a top coat so it doesn&#x27;t smudge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this pen for french tips or any real designs (I tried a bit just to see and it&#x27;s very sloppy with thick lines) so for actual \\&quot;nail art\\&quot; as promised on the package, NO this will not do it. But for my intended purpose it is great and easy to use. I will get more colors!</li>
    <li> Horrible! the designs came out good. But, when I went to take off the nailpolish, i had brown and red marks all over my nails that won&#x27;t come off! The marks are in the exact same place as the original design.&lt;br /&gt;I had a base coat, a strengthening coat, and the actual nail polish between the nail art pen and my nail, but the marks still appeared!</li>
    <li> This little pen is so amazing! I made little snowflakes on my blue nails for Christmas and it came out so professional and I am not a drawer lol Very easy to use. I can&#x27;t wait to get the other colors! :)</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly for my needs. Easy to use and I was able to get very fine lines out of it. I just love these pens for nail art!</li>
    <li> I got this for one of my sisters for Christmas and she loves it. She&#x27;s able to draw cute little designs on her nails. It was an awesome buy!</li>
    <li> These make nail designs simple! I can draw on them just like a pen, however, you have to seal it with a top coat or it washes off with water. Try not to get it on your skin too because it won&#x27;t come off with acetone or nail polish remover right away.</li>
    <li> Chalky matte finish. Rubs off on clothes when dry. Says \\&quot;great for French manicure,\\&quot; but looks like crayon scribble when it dries. Cracks under top coat. No good way to wear it. Looks awful no matter what I try.</li>
    <li> My white Sally Hansen Nail Art pen finally had to be replaced.  I&#x27;ve had it for years.  So I got another one!  These seem pricey but they are so easy to use and work great for nail art!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised that all of the Sally Hansen nail art pens have bad reviews - I personally think these are the best nail art pens on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I own white, turquoise, black, hot pink &amp; love them all!  Once you open the package, press down on the tip for 30 seconds, the polish saturates the tip allowing you to draw on the nail. Do remember to have both a base coat and a top coat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these for thin french manicures, touch ups, or even drawing polkadots / hearts.</li>
    <li> So I bought this item today at CVS thinking I would have a quick and effortless french manicure when I got home. I was really dissapointed though when that did not happen. It was messy using the pen. I would shake it and then put it on paper to get the product out and instead it all came out at once just about and dried out so quickly on the paper , that I could hardly get any on my nails. And because of the mess on the paper all of the paint was wasted. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> This is quite a nice product, though it has the consistency of a black marker, not like regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this item. I got one use out of it and even then the product was super hard to get out. I did what the instructions said to shake and push on a hard surface. I may have gotten a defective one, who knows? But this was not a win for me, and what a shame because I was thinking it would make my nailart that much easier.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use &amp; if you mess up you can actually just wife off and try again (if you wipe off right away). The stuff inside is not exactly nail polish &amp; does not last as long as nail polish, but is great for small nail art.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I realized that I wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong. I tried to do French manicure with that pen. It was ok until I put top coat on. It cracked. First I thought I didn&#x27;t let it dry well. I did it again letting it dry well. It still cracked. I&#x27;d rather use white polish with super fine brush.</li>
    <li> Horrible product! Stayed on my nails for about a day even with a top coat. The pen also ran out within a few times of using it. I will not be buying this pen again:(</li>
    <li> This product may work okay for white polka dots, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t work for a french manicure look.  When I first applied this product, I followed the instructions by applying a base coat first, letting the \\&quot;ink\\&quot; dry, and then following with a top coat. Big mistake. The white \\&quot;ink\\&quot; cracked and bled and flaked off my nails.  The next day, I found little pieces of white stuff in my bed, so I ended up removing it.  I tried again, this time omitting the base coat and starting with oil-free, super-clean nails as another reviewer suggested. This reviewer is obviously employed by Sally Hansen, because I had the exact same results as before, and the exact same results as all other dissatisfied reviewers.  What a waste of money and time. I&#x27;m going back to traditional white french manicure polish.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like these at all.. I put a review on a different color, I think it was the black, or dark blue</li>
    <li> I just got this item and have to say it is awful. It goes on very unevenly and requires two or more coats. Trouble with this is that putting a second coat on destroys the first one. It is not paint like your nail lacquer. More like a liquid powder that dries.  When you try to put a top coat over it, it cracks and separates, kind of like Crackle polish does. Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much to get use to.  Fun for girls to practice and play around at a great price.</li>
