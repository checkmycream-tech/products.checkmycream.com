      <li>Excellent value</li>
      <li>Excellent product and service.  </li>
      <li>Oh, it has an awesome lingering scent that will have Kate Upton calling you within 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Best product on the market for electric shaver users.  </li>
      <li>Very good.</li>
      <li>Great product don&#x27;t know why it was taken away from the stores</li>
      <li>The pre-shave is great</li>
      <li>great product, great price, prompt delivery</li>
      <li>JUST HAPPY I  CAN GET IT ON AMAZON, AND MY DRUGSTORE</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Afta for many years and have found it to be the best pre-electric lotion on the market.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a good value.</li>
      <li>Good price, good product.</li>
      <li>this is a good effective product.  </li>
      <li>Nice aroma</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 15 years and love it!  </li>
      <li>The best pre-electric shave gel for sensitive skin that I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for year, the texture is good b/c it spreads nciely, and it dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>Many years ago, I made the switch from manual to electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>It is better than the liquid because it stays in your hand &amp; then to my face before I use my electric razor.</li>
      <li>I like it better because of closer shave.</li>
      <li>I know you will love it.</li>
      <li>In more than 5 years of use I have never had skin irritation either, so</li>
      <li>I noticed that the bottles were not shrink wrapped or otherwise secured to prevent leaking if the flip top had opened on any of the bottles.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works fine.  </li>
      <li>With the nice aroma, this gel dries fast which helps your beard stand up for a close, smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Buying a 5 pack gave me a great price on an item I use every day and it keeps me from constantly trying to replenish my stock.</li>
      <li>I use an electric razor and this is an indispensable part of my shaving routine.</li>
      <li>I buy 5-10 bottles at a time online, since it&#x27;s not always available in the stores.  </li>
      <li>It is oil free and the ingredients are SD Alcohol 40-B, Water, Cassava Flour, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether, Carbomer 980, Fragrance, Tetrahydroxypropyl Ethylenediamine, BHT.</li>
      <li>It was Original Scent.</li>
      <li>but I got the original scent.  </li>
      <li>A great product and requires very little clean up of my shaver after I&#x27;m done!</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t leave my face as &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; as the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand does and thus I don&#x27;t get a close shave as quickly.</li>
      <li>Set up beard very well and provides a smooth clean shave.  </li>
      <li>I just kept it, but would have preferred the Fresh Scent.</li>
      <li>The site said it was fresh scent</li>
      <li>Much better overall than Lectric Shave which seems to be 80% motor oil.</li>
      <li>It may be a little bit pricey but it works great on my beard (sensitive skin) &amp; makes shaving so much easier.  </li>
      <li>The order was very prompt  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It goes on like a light lotion, dries rapidly and improves the electric shave immensely.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive, but my OCD makes me desire a very close shave.  </li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
      <li>considering it was ordered just before Christmas using normal shipping.</li>
      <li>This product dries quickly and seems to really suck the moisture off my face as compared to other pre-shave products.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but it is becoming hard to find.  </li>
      <li>My neck always ends up red and sensitive after shaving.  </li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t think it is as economical but am not sure about that as yet.</li>

<ol>
    <li> great product, great price, prompt delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for year, the texture is good b/c it spreads nciely, and it dries quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t sting.  In more than 5 years of use I have never had skin irritation either, so I thin this is a good effective product.  It&#x27;s also a good value.</li>
    <li> Used to use CVS but changed back to afta.  I like it better because of closer shave.</li>
    <li> The pre-shave is great but it is becoming hard to find.  The order was very prompt  considering it was ordered just before Christmas using normal shipping.</li>
    <li> A great product and requires very little clean up of my shaver after I&#x27;m done! (No clogging)</li>
    <li> This stuff is another secret weapon in the world of electric shaving. It is oil free and the ingredients are SD Alcohol 40-B, Water, Cassava Flour, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether, Carbomer 980, Fragrance, Tetrahydroxypropyl Ethylenediamine, BHT. FLOUR!! Now I personally like flour on my face. But seriously here&#x27;s how this stuff works. It goes on like a light lotion, dries rapidly and improves the electric shave immensely. Much better overall than Lectric Shave which seems to be 80% motor oil. Electric shavers just give this stuff a try. I know you will love it. Oh, it has an awesome lingering scent that will have Kate Upton calling you within 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected.  Have used for years and it is hard to find except on line.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years since I switched to electric shavers.  My supermarket stopped carrying this product about 2 yrs. ago and I found it on Amazon.  It may be a little bit pricey but it works great on my beard (sensitive skin) &amp; makes shaving so much easier.  I have no idea why the local stores stopped carrying it, but as long as Amazon carries it, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it here.  Highly recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The site said it was fresh scent but I got the original scent.  Otherwise, all was as expected.</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I made the switch from manual to electric shaver.  My skin is very sensitive, but my OCD makes me desire a very close shave.  After showering, I apply this product which makes my shaving experience downright pleasurable!  No burn whatsoever.  I buy 5-10 bottles at a time online, since it&#x27;s not always available in the stores.  I&#x27;ve used it for decades &amp; I&#x27;ll be using it for life!</li>
    <li> Very good. On time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Good price, good product.</li>
    <li> It was NOT Fresh Scent as advertised. It was Original Scent. I just kept it, but would have preferred the Fresh Scent.</li>
    <li> Nice aroma but it doesn&#x27;t leave my face as &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; as the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand does and thus I don&#x27;t get a close shave as quickly. I also don&#x27;t think it is as economical but am not sure about that as yet. But it does the job.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get along without Afta Pre-shave. I use an electric razor and this is an indispensable part of my shaving routine. Buying a 5 pack gave me a great price on an item I use every day and it keeps me from constantly trying to replenish my stock.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the pre-electric shave lotion.</li>
    <li> Great product don&#x27;t know why it was taken away from the stores that I usually go to but no on seems to carry this at all.</li>
    <li> HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT SINCE IT CAME OUT DECADES AGO....JUST HAPPY I  CAN GET IT ON AMAZON, AND MY DRUGSTORE NO LONGER CARRIES IT....HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT&#x27;S USE ON FACE BEFORE USING ELECTRIC RAZOR, AS IT SOFTENS THE BEARD...HAS A PLEASING BUT ALMOST NON EXISTENT FRAGERANCE FOR A MALE.......</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing these product for monts when I discovered it in my local store. It is better than the liquid because it stays in your hand &amp; then to my face before I use my electric razor.</li>
    <li> The best pre-electric shave gel for sensitive skin that I&#x27;ve found.  My neck always ends up red and sensitive after shaving.  This product virtually eliminates that.</li>
    <li> husband loves this product</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.  I noticed that the bottles were not shrink wrapped or otherwise secured to prevent leaking if the flip top had opened on any of the bottles.  These bottles do not have an internal safety seal so I can see how some folks might have received an order of these bottles that had leaked (previous reveiws).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works fine.  I use about a dime size amount on my face and then allow it to dry for a few minutes.  This product dries quickly and seems to really suck the moisture off my face as compared to other pre-shave products.  My electric razor has not had any problems since I started using this brand.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market for electric shaver users.  Set up beard very well and provides a smooth clean shave.  I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 15 years and love it!  Getting hard to find in local grocery and retail outlets.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.  Excellent value</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Afta for many years and have found it to be the best pre-electric lotion on the market. With the nice aroma, this gel dries fast which helps your beard stand up for a close, smooth shave. Also like the After Shave Lotion .</li>
