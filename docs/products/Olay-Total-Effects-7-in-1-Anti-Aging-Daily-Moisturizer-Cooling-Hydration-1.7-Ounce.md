      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product many times and it&#x27;s a favorite of mine.  </li>
      <li>and I have abused my skin with a lot of sun for many</li>
      <li>The Path * { better shampoo, conditioner , skin care , nails, pedicures, hair removal products</li>
      <li>So I chose the items that really impressed me or put on a short list to try again..</li>
      <li>This sleek bottle of wonders does what it says and more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased as punch..</li>
      <li>and thats pretty good</li>
      <li>i think it smells pretty good.    </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and it has a nice light order.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this daily for 2 weeks and don&#x27;t see any change, it goes on nice &amp; feels good</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m fine with this but not the cooling effect I wanted.</li>
      <li>Now that I can order the ones I want, at a savings, with 2 day shipping , free to boot , if it is part of the Prime allowed items..</li>
      <li>looks so much bigger but its sort of a rip off i put the cream on has great scent but no difference on my skin .</li>
      <li>light weight</li>
      <li>Free freight and arrived on time.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>good quality and non greasy and makes my skin feel so soft and ageless.</li>
      <li>I was surprised because Olay has some good products out there.  </li>
      <li>the cool effect seems to keep me chill for a bit</li>
      <li>so def worth checking out and buying -</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t return the product because I needed it right away</li>
      <li>while keeping it&#x27;s promise -- diminished fine lines, soft well hydrated skin + cooling sensation.</li>
      <li>highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>Be aware -</li>
      <li>It gives plenty of hydration with no shine, just a pretty dewy look.</li>
      <li>feeling at all very hydrating makes me look dewy!</li>
      <li>no hassles , no worries, all done fast and right...</li>
      <li>I have combination skin which has become more dry this winter</li>
      <li>I can only speak from how easy all that was to do..</li>
      <li>And I sure wouldn&#x27;t want to do that because this stuff costs a whole lot per ounce for those of us on a limited budget.</li>
      <li>bought this for about 20 dollars  great cream but extremely small size of a finger!!</li>
      <li>I did not seem much improvement with this product.  </li>
      <li>Seemed no matter what lotion she used, or how much - her skin would always very quickly feel dry and often itchy again.    </li>
      <li>I like this product more than the other 7-in-1 moisturizer.</li>
      <li>, the list goes on } I use a great toner , facial cleanser , day cream { this one rocks , I wear very little make-up , so I have had no problem with make-up flaking  or melting off from the  heat ..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of moisturizer for my very sensitive skin and found this to be completely non-irritating and it moisturizes well.</li>
      <li>I really like facial products that feel clean and natural.</li>
      <li>I found it to be too fragrant and left my skin feeling more dry.  </li>
      <li>Skin became clear.</li>
      <li>I like that the same amount comes out each time with one press on the pump--it helps prevent accidentally squirting out too much.</li>
      <li>sometimes sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to find you can add 4 people to the account...</li>
      <li>uber sensitive people when it comes to pain or discomfort</li>
      <li>But she quickly looked past that and started using it.  </li>
      <li>But at least in the short term, it seems to be working better than all the other lotions</li>
      <li>I have used this in the past , and of course never stayed with a product long enough to see any true results because in my mind it should have happened quicker than any change I was seeing..</li>

<li> Is my quest over , probably not, as I hear  a few new products are hitting the shelves..</li>
<li> Dry winter months dont help any.    </li>
<li> I bought her the 7 in 1 anti aging lotion,  but picked the cooling hydration since helping the dry skin</li>
<li> Shes always had dry skin.</li>
<li> and then they only had a few left.</li>
<li> /&gt;Wonder why so few stores seem to carry this, and only sell the Total Effect moisturizer in the shorter size?</li>
<li> , I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because initially after applied, you&#x27;ll feel a slight burning sensation before it cools off.</li>
<li> that said using some really expensive facial cleansers , and creams ,serums, and masks left me feeling the same way...</li>
<li> I have other lotions that \\&quot;wake you up\\&quot; when you put them on.</li>
<li> At first she looked at me like i was crazy for giving her an \\&quot;anti aging\\&quot; lotion like i was trying to drop her a hint</li>
<li> but it does soften the creases in my face a little.</li>
<li> little or no perfume odor.</li>
<li> This was too heavy for the morning and nothing cooling about it.</li>
<li> I also felt that it left an uncomfortable residue on my face.  </li>
<li> Easier to take as travel item due to tall, thin</li>
<li> Unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t the \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; cream I expected.</li>
<li> Needless to say...... I&#x27;m not happy about losing so much of an already expensive product.  </li>
<li> Smells terrible!</li>
<li> Started having nasty acne after I started using this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I never break out, never had pimples or blemishes while keeping it&#x27;s promise -- diminished fine lines, soft well hydrated skin + cooling sensation. I love it !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For uber sensitive people when it comes to pain or discomfort, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because initially after applied, you&#x27;ll feel a slight burning sensation before it cools off.</li>
    <li> I was espected it is made from Thailand, but the one I received is made in China, still pretty good product!   This is my second bottle, great product good price, I like it! will keep use it</li>
    <li> Smells terrible! I cannot believe Olay would sell a product that smelled so strong.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Good moisturizer! Smells very strong.</li>
    <li> bought this for about 20 dollars  great cream but extremely small size of a finger!! looks so much bigger but its sort of a rip off i put the cream on has great scent but no difference on my skin . i dont reccomend this  for its price and size.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin which has become more dry this winter so I was looking for extra moisture.  I did not like this moisturizer.  I found it to be too fragrant and left my skin feeling more dry.  I also felt that it left an uncomfortable residue on my face.  I really like facial products that feel clean and natural. This did not for me.</li>
    <li> Love this cream it makes your face feel soo nice&lt;br /&gt;And the cool effect seems to keep me chill for a bit</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves lotions.  Shes always had dry skin. sometimes sensitive skin.  Seemed no matter what lotion she used, or how much - her skin would always very quickly feel dry and often itchy again.    I bought her the 7 in 1 anti aging lotion,  but picked the cooling hydration since helping the dry skin was a priority. At first she looked at me like i was crazy for giving her an \\&quot;anti aging\\&quot; lotion like i was trying to drop her a hint lol.  But she quickly looked past that and started using it.  The next day she was telling me she seemed to noticed a difference.  That she didnt need to reapply more &amp; more lotion.  That her hands/face still seemed OK.  and thats pretty good considering we&#x27;re also in the rust/salt belt of the midwest.  Dry winter months dont help any.    Now, i dont know how well this will work long-term.  But at least in the short term, it seems to be working better than all the other lotions shes tried out there.  but paying 16 bucks for a 1.6oz bottle.  id sure hope so.    The smell is nice and pleasant.  Not overpowering at all; it wont make you feel like your being chased around by a perfume/fragrance lady at a store/mall.  and thats from a guys point of view.  i think it smells pretty good.    so def worth checking out and buying - if you or your friend/loved one is always on the lookout for a nice quality lotion.</li>
    <li> This sleek bottle of wonders does what it says and more. It feels very light and refreshing as I apply it, without a greasy or sticky feeling, as I get with most moisterizers. It gives plenty of hydration with no shine, just a pretty dewy look. Oh!, and I have to mention, that it&#x27;s alot cheaper here than at Walmart. This is A keeper!!</li>
    <li> I am 73 and I have abused my skin with a lot of sun for many decades.&lt;br /&gt;Total effects does not work miracles but it does soften the creases in my face a little. My wife tried it and now prefers it to the good quality olive oil she used to use.</li>
    <li> I did not seem much improvement with this product.  I was surprised because Olay has some good products out there.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 3 weeks now and i dont see any difference in my skin so i guess each skin is different , so i guess you will just have to try it , i give it from 1-5 i give it a 2. thats just my opinion , the product does smell good though,</li>
    <li> This one is I will give my daughter,I have the same one in a jar,beleive me when I say its a great day moustirizer!!!..highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times and it&#x27;s a favorite of mine.  My last order arrived with the cap off and a lot of the product smeared about the rest of the items.  I didn&#x27;t return the product because I needed it right away and I didn&#x27;t want to wait for a return. Needless to say...... I&#x27;m not happy about losing so much of an already expensive product.  The product itself, what&#x27;s left of it, is truly wonderful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and helps my skin to look great. I recommend it to everyone I know. I especially love it for overnight.</li>
    <li> Started having nasty acne after I started using this product. As soon as I discontinued it. Skin became clear. Stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this moisturizer for a couple of months now. It&#x27;s never in stock at local stores and when I do find it the cost is $20-22 (on sale).&lt;br /&gt;I found it on Amazon for $10 you can&#x27;t beat that. Free freight and arrived on time. Unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t the \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; cream I expected. I have other lotions that \\&quot;wake you up\\&quot; when you put them on. This was too heavy for the morning and nothing cooling about it. As a moisturizer it is wonderful and I use the night cream from Total Effects and love it. So I&#x27;m fine with this but not the cooling effect I wanted.</li>
    <li> Be aware - This product contains 5 types of Parabens, which are not listed on Amazon&#x27;s description!  The 5 types are: Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.  As regards the product itself, I found it ineffective.</li>
    <li> I am combining this product with the majestic pure eye gel and have seen great results after one week. It goes on smooth and it has a nice light order.  The advertisement says it will replace your beauty regime so we will see.  I will order more when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> This is non greasy and works just like the manufactures says it works.  Use it mornings and at night. Also it is packaged well.</li>
    <li> good quality and non greasy and makes my skin feel so soft and ageless. I would recommend it for men also. little or no perfume odor.</li>
    <li> light weight and it&#x27;s Not greesy feeling at all very hydrating makes me look dewy! So far I&#x27;m happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find in stores, and I purchased on line. The price was Great, and I am an Olay fan!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of moisturizer for my very sensitive skin and found this to be completely non-irritating and it moisturizes well. I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; means. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I look any younger as a result of using it. I like that the same amount comes out each time with one press on the pump--it helps prevent accidentally squirting out too much. And I sure wouldn&#x27;t want to do that because this stuff costs a whole lot per ounce for those of us on a limited budget. The best deal around is to buy a two-pack on Amazon. That cost will beat a retail purchase by several dollars.</li>
    <li> I like this product more than the other 7-in-1 moisturizer. Goes on smoothly. Light, pleasant scent. Feels great. Seems to last longer than the shorter, wider container of moisturizer, although the content of both is 1.7 fl oz. Easier to take as travel item due to tall, thin size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder why so few stores seem to carry this, and only sell the Total Effect moisturizer in the shorter size? I had to order it on-line and then they only had a few left.</li>
    <li> I just joined the Amazon Prime this month after a 30 day trial...I was surprised to find you can add 4 people to the account...I added my Mom , and these items were for her..I can only speak from how easy all that was to do..I added , she ordered..no hassles , no worries, all done fast and right...I have used this in the past , and of course never stayed with a product long enough to see any true results because in my mind it should have happened quicker than any change I was seeing.. that said using some really expensive facial cleansers , and creams ,serums, and masks left me feeling the same way...So I chose the items that really impressed me or put on a short list to try again..Some say to stay with all one line , but I&#x27;ve found some agree with my skin others don&#x27;t ..So that&#x27;s how I got started on * The Path * { better shampoo, conditioner , skin care , nails, pedicures, hair removal products, the list goes on } I use a great toner , facial cleanser , day cream { this one rocks , I wear very little make-up , so I have had no problem with make-up flaking  or melting off from the  heat ..Is my quest over , probably not, as I hear  a few new products are hitting the shelves..Now that I can order the ones I want, at a savings, with 2 day shipping , free to boot , if it is part of the Prime allowed items..I&#x27;m pleased as punch..One thing I&#x27;m not liking ,on the save and subscribe items is  that  some items I like are not  on the list  yet...hint , hint, add some more please.. :-))</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily for 2 weeks and don&#x27;t see any change, it goes on nice &amp; feels good but I haven&#x27;t seen any change in texture. It&#x27;s just OK</li>
</ol>
