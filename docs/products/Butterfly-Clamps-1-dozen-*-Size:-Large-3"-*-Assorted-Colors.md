<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been looking for these for years.  I still have a few of the ones I bought years and years ago, but haven&#x27;t been able to find them.  I just figured they were a relic of the past, and then I stumbled across them on Amazon.  I keep one in the shower, so after conditioning I can put my hair up while the conditioner does its thing.  I keep a few with my other hair products, in case I want to clip it in place till the gel or whatever product of the moment kicks in.  I keep a couple around for working out, to get my hair out of the way.  I keep a couple by my bedside, in case it&#x27;s a warm night and I want it up.  These are so incredibly handy.  I love them, they work great.  The only way I&#x27;ve had them break is if someone steps on them!  They won&#x27;t just crack or snap or anything.  I bought two packs of them, so that should last me a lifetime!</li>
    <li> These clips are okay.  If you have to order online..go for it.  But they are nothing special.  A few of mine broke in the drawer due to no neglect. So..they are okay.</li>
    <li> works well for sectioning hair when i style it</li>
    <li> does the job just like its suppose to. Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> love them no doubt................. there are really strong and will last you forever..... good for long hair too.....good product....thanx..i will purchase another set again.. try making pink and black too</li>
    <li> Yayyy so excited these little beauties will be very helpful especially now that I am transitioning from perm hair to natural. Will be good for sectioning my hair for styling.</li>
    <li> Wow these are great for us with think hair as they hold so well and they are so strong.  Love them. Great filler when your order to be $25 for the free shipping.</li>
    <li> love these so hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> I like these clips because they stay where you put them. They don&#x27;t slip out or move around in your hair. These are good for almost any hair-do</li>
    <li> I always used these to pull my hair up, especially when straightening my hair to help know where I havent straightened and where I have. Couldn&#x27;t find them at  walmart or target so I ordered these. They work just fine. &#x3D;) Wish they had greens and other colors.</li>
    <li> These clips work great and are the price is awesome. The really grip the hair and it&#x27;s nice to have a big stack since they tend to wander around the house.</li>
    <li> Great clamps for chip bags and etc.</li>
    <li> I really love these clamps , great way to style hair when on the go or good for doing my hair keeping parts separate.</li>
    <li> They are very durable and holds down very thick hair in place. I love this clamps!!&lt;br /&gt;I use these to help hold down my hair when I section it off. The are very secure as well.</li>
    <li> These clippies are old school and tough to find in stores. This selection of colors is great and the price is great too!! Delivery time: Lickety split!</li>
    <li> I needed these! I am always losing my hair clips. These are just some cheap/affordable hair clips to get my annoying bangs outta my face when applying makeup or whatnot. Pretty pastel colors. Fast shipping. Havent had any break on me yet..</li>
    <li> These clips are a very good value, and they are perfect for my needs.  I bought these to hold my spiral rollers in my hair, I&#x27;m going to order another set to have enough for my whole head.  All in all a good purchase!</li>
    <li> THE QUALITY WASNT THE GREATEST BUT IT HOLDS THE HAIR TOGETHER NOT THE MOST COMFY BUT FOR THE PRICE I CANT COMPLAIN...SO IF YOUA RE LOOKING FOR A SIMPLE CLIP TO HLEP WHEN STYLKING HAIR OR TO JUST HOLD HAIR BACK THIS WILL DO,,</li>
    <li> I recently acquired a flat iron and wanted clips like these to section and hold my daughter&#x27;s hair while we used the flat iron. These are well-made in friendly colors, and they&#x27;re nicely curved rather than straight. The jaws hold well but aren&#x27;t too strong. Really an ideal solution and at a great price, too.</li>
    <li> Good assortment of colors.  Good construction.  Good grip of the hair.  Good buy for the money. An excellent addition either to the kitchen beautician or professional&#x27;s collection.</li>
    <li> cannot hold hair securely</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect. My fiance and I have been sharing and rotating about 5 of these clips, and none have broken yet. Great quality.</li>
    <li> My hair is too thick they can&#x27;t hold my hair</li>
    <li> Good quality and showed up really fast. These have stood up to a few uses and haven&#x27;t had a problem at all. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It arrived super fast...in the day that I was going to color my hair. I love those clips and make my life easy...worth the $.&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
    <li> Very handy when i&amp;#34;m blow drying my hair, they hold in place very well</li>
    <li> I just needed some clamps to help with separating my thick and crazy hair (lol). These were firm holding and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is awesome and they last long a must have if u don&#x27;t wanna tie your hair , they also work for any type of hair</li>
    <li> Cute clips, good quality &amp; price - I would&#x27;ve liked a bigger selection of colors but I&#x27;ll just order a different set.</li>
    <li> Use these everyday to style my hair! Grip really well and stay in place</li>
    <li> These clamps are great!  I use these when I fix my hair, and I really recommend them.  They do the job.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it - she&#x27;s currently in Beauty School and is needing all the supplies required once she graduates.</li>
    <li> Very good and sturdy for natural hair!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome for the price you cant go wrong&lt;br /&gt;with these! Great for thick hair! Makes managing hair easy!</li>
    <li> The clips are so helpful when doing my hair. The clips really hold your hair in place. I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice clips pull hair out of the way while doing sections of hair.  Just the right size</li>
    <li> when I part my hair to curl/straighten/wave/braid it Its always a hassle to tie my hair up with a rubber band to keep it out of my face. I LOVE these ! all I do is twist my hair &amp; clip it to the top of my head, no hassle &amp; no pain! definitely ordering more when mine are worn out. they seem pretty durable though,</li>
    <li> The title is pretty self explanatory. I assumed *assorted colors meant the colors shown. Boy was I wrong. I received Navy Blue and neon purple. Not pleased.</li>
    <li> I interviewed my wife&#x27;s hair and they said they love these clips. I love my wife, my wife loves her hair, so I trust their opinions.</li>
    <li> Love them! Nice and sturdy!</li>
    <li> love these clips! great for curling, styling hair.  Holds easily &amp; the colors are fun too.  I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great clips, I use them to section my hair when detangling and styling, they are not flimsy and cheap. Good quality</li>
    <li> I just got a curling wand and wanted clips to help separate sections. These clips were great. They don&#x27;t hurt your head and pull your hair like other clips I have. Gentle and durable! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These clips are perfect for parting out your hair and putting it up into sections or half way up. I like that you get a lot for not a lot of money and they seem to last forever. They also, as far as I have noticed, do not leave clamp marks in your hair. I would not wear these out and about but they are great as helpers when you are doing your hair in the morning!!!</li>
    <li> I love using these clips when I am blow drying and styling my hair! They are good quality, the colors are pretty and they hold well on my thick hair!</li>
    <li> They are effective in clipping the hair but the edges at the top are sharp and they actually scratch your skin as you are manipulating your hair</li>
    <li> I use these very often now since my hair got a little longer. They are very useful. They are great</li>
    <li> I really like these clamps. They are awesome...the colors are cute and vibrant and I have enjoyed using them...I have had them for a year now and still as good as when I got them in the mail</li>
    <li> They worked well, I used them on wash days. The clips are sturdy and holds my hair well. I wish they would have came in different sizes but I can work with what I have.</li>
    <li> Love these clips! They are very useful in separating sections and holding hair out of your face. Great product.</li>
    <li> These are &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; clips not just in price BUT work just fine. I love the colors, especially lavendar and purple. I sometimes wear these clips out of the house when they match my clothes. Mostly I use them at home just to keep my hair up and when trimming or coloring my hair. Have been using them for awhile and they&#x27;re holding up fine. The batch of them is scattered all about so I always have a cilp or two handy. They may not be the highest quality, but they&#x27;re sturdy, and price makes them very practical.</li>
    <li> Colors look slightly so ever different not much at all. Great product. Arrived on time. I have long thick hair so these clips are very beneficial for me. The colors match my work colors so its a win win. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it got here</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to buy these... they make it SO much easier to section your hair, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Yes, they&#x27;re just plastic clips, but very functional plastic clips at that. Definitely would recommend for anybody blow drying/straightening/curling hair.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> Simple, cheap, effective clips. I needed a set when I first bleached my hair getting ready to put some manic panic in it after, and these were big enough to handle pieces of my (then) longer hair. Ordered them around Christmas time (2013) and still goin&#x27; strong.</li>
    <li> I use a clip to hold my hair out of the way when blow drying or using the straight iron.  These clips perform that duty very well and they&#x27;re bright enough that I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing them on my dresser!</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted very wide and holds a lot of hair. You can pin your hair up with just one clip.</li>
    <li> I bought the clips because the old ones all broke up and I made a good choice choosing this pack, they are very good indeed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and love the colors. I use it every day when I do my hair or just help putting my hair in place.</li>
    <li> Typical butterfly clamps.  They do not pull my hair and the colors are adorable.  Works wonders for organizing your hair while straightening.  A straightforward purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these specifically to keep in my toothbrush drawer so that when I brush my teeth I can just pull my hair back on each side to lean over the sink. works perfectly for that. I wouldn&#x27;t say these are good for holding up all my hair and wearing them for long periods, but just for sections they are perfect!</li>
    <li> I use these little suckers everyday putting my hair back when putting makeup on/washing my face/something of that nature. They are a little flimsy but not unbearably I-cant-hold-this flimsy. It looks just as the picture is and I&#x27;d probably buy them again because...well I stepped on one today and it broke so I have a feeling I&#x27;ll somehow break them all :c</li>
    <li> Had no problem with the clamps and color is beautiful..... love them. I have very thick natural hair so these come in handy</li>
    <li> These are convenient to use around the house (as bag pins) as well as for the hair.</li>
    <li> These clamps do what they are supposed to do. I have very thick hair and these still get the job done!</li>
    <li> Yes, they do the job of putting your hair up when you don&#x27;t feel like having it constantly in your face. BUT, these are very overpriced for being little plastic, cheaply made butterfly clamps/clips. These can be bought at Sally Beauty for $1.99! The colors on these clamps do not look the same in person as they do online and almost all of them broke after using them for about a week.  Oh, and did I mention they&#x27;re OVERPRICED?</li>
    <li> I had hoped for a little higher quality item.  They are just okay.  Useful, but not as nice as the salon clips.</li>
    <li> These clamps are not sturdy enough for my hair. My hair is extremely thick and these clamps were not strong enough to hold my hair in place.</li>
    <li> To cheap. Sorry I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> They are butterfly clips. They work. They are cheap. That&#x27;s enough isn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> It was on time and excellent product will be placing another order</li>
    <li> love the butterfly clamps. my hair washing usually lasts for 1 hour but now that i have the clamps, it only last around 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for clips for a while now and I finally found some great ones. I use on my natural hair and my extensions and there very sturdy and don&#x27;t snag my hair. And 12 clips are more than enough for my hair.</li>
    <li> item as described and i love them</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair and these work better for me than alligator clips.</li>
    <li> I bought these clamps to I could separate my hair as I deep conditioned or detangled my hair. They are great and strong, If you have thick or long hair or even thin and short  hair, these clamps are a good buy.  I use these every week I do my hair,, I would recommend these clamps...</li>
    <li> These clips are so handy when doing our hair.  They shipped fast and I still have them and use them often, we got them almost a year ago.  I recommend</li>
    <li> These clamps are great when you&#x27;re using styling tools on your hair, especially my long, thick hair. The colors are so cute as well!</li>
    <li> I use these to separate my hair when I&#x27;m blow drying it. It&#x27;s perfect for good thick hair. Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> For their size these are super!  They hold the hair and are super comfortable without poking the head as some clamps do.  I am 71 and have thinning hair so I would not be able to wear them if they hurt...yep, like these.</li>
    <li> These hold, but they also snag my hair (the metal springs catch the hair). I will be repurposing these as kitchen bag closures.</li>
    <li> These butterfly clamps were just what I was looking for.  They are a great size and come in a nice array of colors.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Hold onto hair great!!</li>
    <li> Wanted something to hold hair secure when I section off to style.  These hold alot of hair and hold it very secure.  Glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> these are very breakable especially if you have kids .but I prefer something better quality. this is very cheap product.</li>
    <li> Sturdy clips, still using.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and wasn&#x27;t sure these would even work.  I&#x27;ve used other products and within days, they break.  I use them for putting my hair up to style.  I&#x27;ve been using the first one out of the bag for 2 months now and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
    <li> This item matched product discription exactly. It is doing just what I needed it to do, hold my hair while detangling.</li>
    <li> So I bought these as a means to assist me with my hair routine. I have thick, curly/wavy hair (3a/3b if you are into \\&quot;hair typing\\&quot;) and it can be somewhat interesting to detangle. I bought these clips thinking they could be helpful in keeping my hair out of the way after it has been detangled. I have found them rather difficult to use since they tend to snag in my hair. I cannot speak for someone else&#x27;s hair but these are mostly useless now for me.</li>
    <li> This item was back ordered in early December and I was notified that I should get it by Dec. 25th.  I have not received them as of today 12/29/12.</li>
    <li> The clips are great securing hair when it is sectioned off, the clips are large and easy to handle, great for all hair types.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and big clamps. I use them all the time when I am sectioning my hair and it holds all of my natural hair securely</li>
    <li> It works but it looks a bit cheap for the price.</li>
    <li> do their job but break easily</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t have enough clamps because I break them and lose them. These are more durable than they look in the picture.  I rush through my three daughters&#x27; hair and haven&#x27;t broken any yet. They are also slimmer than the ones in the super market &amp; fit more easily into my travel hair kit.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, great value! Bought for myself and my daughter,  Would recommended to any woman out there.</li>
    <li> I use these clips everyday and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that they came in a dozen because I seem to misplace them quite often as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have extremely thick hair and they seem to hold it just fine.</li>
    <li> The clips are nice and no doubt will be totally useful because who doesn&#x27;t use clips.  The colors listed are lighter than they really are, but still pretty.  The lighter purple ones are darker like the top ones and the blue ones are more navy.  Other than the slight difference in color, I&#x27;m fine with them.  I have had these clips in the past and they have held up well, just wanted to have more on hand.  I had a shortage doing my hair and went a little crazy getting the dozen pack, but I&#x27;m sure I will use them.  I use these kind of clips everyday.</li>
    <li> I use these when I put my hair up to do my makeup. With my thick hair they stay in place the whole time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I dont work at a salon, or do any cosmetology type things, but these clips are great for when youre straightening youre hair, or curling it or whatnot. They work really well, and I am very satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this about a month ago. I love , love ,love all the colors ...they&#x27;re mid-size and dont get me headaches when I wear them. No scratcging or irritating the scalp...</li>
    <li> these are great clamps help with keeping the hair where you want it. Can also be used to close your bags of chips.</li>
    <li> The clips were thinner than I expected. However, they help my hair together wonderfully and that is all that matters. i would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> These clamps are reasonably priced and work well when I&#x27;m sectioning my hair.  I&#x27;ve used them multiple times now and none have broke.</li>
    <li> These are very sturdy clamps.  Very good price.  I will purchase smaller clamps to add to my collection of clamps.</li>
    <li> Work great and inexpensive, they do the job they are supposed to. And, the order was shipped quickly and arrived undamaged.</li>
    <li> love them... cant beat that price</li>
    <li> Nothing special about these. They do exactly what they are supposed to do, so I gave it 5 stars. :-)</li>
    <li> These are great- the teeth really hold the clips in your hair. You can&#x27;t beat the price and the fun colors.</li>
    <li> I bought some butterfly clips and regretted not splurging on more before I moved. When I found a product that looked identical - aside from the colour-selection - I jumped on them. Unfortunately, the low price manifests in the cheap quality here as opposed to a bargain elsewhere. Each clip holds its spring, which itself isn&#x27;t much, in a small, plastic enclosure that will break with regular use. The return process would have eaten into my next move, so I gave them to a friend&#x27;s kid. These clips are so dull and weak, they do not even threaten a toddler. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Great buy, good quality.</li>
    <li> I like these chip-clip style clamps much better than the long alligator clips for sectioning hair.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with this purchase. I like the price (3.75 $) , different colors as well as the strength of the springs (I have replaced my daily clamps with these butterfly clamps as they keep my hair fixed in the position when I am working at home).</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do it just didn&#x27;t come in the colors shown. It came in yellow, red, and green.</li>
    <li> Perfect just as advertised and sturdy!</li>
    <li> These work great for clipping parts of your hair up as you are styling. Definitely not great for everyday use around the house as it doesn&#x27;t hold hair up securely, especially thicker hair. Definitely not high quality but great for styling.</li>
    <li> good price, good quality</li>
    <li> I use these when I curl my hair and dye it. They really get the job done. They dont pop off with the thickness of my hair.</li>
    <li> It works beautifully and I am so pleased with the product. I would recommend this product to everyone.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> clips hold up very well and i love the colors  i wear hair extension so good for holding up my hair while it straighten my hair</li>
    <li> good deal! doing my hair is so much more easiler, I have pretty thick and long hair and these clips really help when I am using my BedHead wand and wave artist.</li>
    <li> I love my butterfly Clamps they are just the right size for me and my daughter&#x27;s hair because we have thick hair.</li>
    <li> I love this for hair pin up with conditioner while it soaks in. The length of clip is good, claw teeth are just right too.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and its medium long... but when im straightening it... i need something to seperate my hair and hold it well without falling out!!! this does the trick.. it takes about 5 to section off my hair and they hold also was great using these when i dyed my hair!! ;) love em! so glad i bought them!!!</li>
    <li> Plenty of clamps for a good price. Holds my hair very well.</li>
    <li> Holds my hair really well. I love it. Shipped fast. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> they do exactly what i want them to do ( hold my hair into place and out of my face until i am ready for that section)</li>
    <li> Highly Recommend. Great. Will purchase again and again when needed. Great Price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive item that does its job then you can gladly go ahead with the purchase. These clips are fragile so One has to handle carefully if not delicately. I use this for holding my hair secure during shower or when I apply some masks for my hair. I love these versatile colors. I am purchasing the black ones in the near future.</li>
    <li> Can never find a hair clip. Now I have enough that I never lose one.</li>
    <li> These clips are wonderful, i am natural 4c and have really thick hair I sooo need to put it into sections to work with and this does it perfectly!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked all around at my local stores for these clamps &amp; couldn&#x27;t find any.  Great size &amp; exactly whati was looking for.  Have held up well.</li>
    <li> I bought this clips to lessen the task of washing and detangling&lt;br /&gt;my extremely curly-kinky hair. It&#x27;s made a big difference than using hair ties&lt;br /&gt;and stays in place--even at the most awkward angles! It&#x27;s been perfect so far!</li>
    <li> Love my butterfly clips. I sue them all the time.</li>
    <li> I needed some clips to hold my hair up when blow drying, straightening, or curling my hair and I&#x27;m so glad I chose to order these ones. They hold up great, and the colors are cute.</li>
    <li> I really love these clips! A pack lasts me a year or so before I lose them mysteriously. They hold out well for coloring hair, cutting hair, and styling them well. I recommend them and they are colorful and good to look at.</li>
    <li> These are low priced and you get a fairly light weight, flimsy clip, Hair clips dont need to be ultra strong but these break easily. Okay for the price, but if you plan to use them a lot you might want to try another option.</li>
    <li> it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it help me good&lt;br /&gt;i like it ,&lt;br /&gt;it look not bad.&lt;br /&gt;~~~ ~ ~ ~</li>
    <li> These clamps make dyeing or even creating hairdos so much easier. Before I just pinned it up, but this is faster. There are plenty in one pack to make it all you need. Inexpensive way to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Very helpful when sectioning my hair for a washday</li>
    <li> I use these clips all the time when section my hair for detangling or styling. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Great item, made well with a softer plastic that bends slightly. No fear of the clips snapping and breaking that may happen with a hard plastic. Nice colors too!</li>
    <li> These clips are kind of cheap looking and I am scared they are going to be too weak and will break after a few uses. I&#x27;ve only used one once, and so far so good. It holds my moderately thick hair back and I have a feeling they won&#x27;t end up as bad as I predicted. For the price, it isn&#x27;t that much of a risk.</li>
    <li> These clips are great they can be used when styling your hair or just to tie it back. I like the colors and they are very durable none have broken so far and ive had them a while i use them when straightening my hair as it long i need to do section by section and they hold my hair in place and do not scratch my scalp which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend and buy again if need be in the future!</li>
    <li> Though the quality isn&#x27;t the best, the clips are very good at holding my (thick) hair up. Great to use during styling or dying. I would definitely recommend these clips.</li>
    <li> good price and these work well for me when im doing my hair in layers. easy to use and the bright colors are helpful</li>
    <li> Purchased these to use on my natural hair.  It can be a challenge separating my hair to braid or condition.  These are the perfect size and quite durable.  I like the colors as they are easy to find when needed.  A happy customer that will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product but over 25 dollars in shipping I got screwed</li>
    <li> these clips are perfect for the shower, doing your hair just everything! I keep one with me at all times!</li>
    <li> I recently went natural and I big chopped so it&#x27;s hard to get product on my scalp without help. These are perfect!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty good quality clips! None have broken on me yet, and they really come in handy when doing my hair.</li>
    <li> Theyre cute colors and do the job. I was hoping they were much stronger in grip but it works.</li>
    <li> It was only $1.00 and serves it needs while separating my hair.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find these in stores and I had an old one (about 10 years) that was getting ready to break.  I really like these.  I love the color and how many you get!  They don&#x27;t hold as tight as my old one, but that is the only bad (not very bad) thing I can say.  They are a great product and came on time and packaged well.</li>
    <li> There ok clamps the seem a bit cheaply made but overall they work well for holding hair.</li>
    <li> Bought these hair clamps to help when I am doing my hair and they work well. They don&#x27;t hold too much hair at once but that is why they give you a few.</li>
    <li> I use it only at home but they hold my hair very good.</li>
    <li> FINALLY! A sturdy hair clip that holds my hair! I had to constantly replace previous clips, therefore wasting way too much money. The butterfly clamps are durable and lasting. They still look and feel new after using them for about 6 weeks and I use them daily in hair grooming and styling. Also, the metal spring clipping holds and does not slip out of its joints. Glad I found these.</li>
    <li> Love these clamps.  Love the colors and are great for keeping your hair out of your face. I want to order more.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I love the colors and they came just as descibed. I would highly recommend for anyone who wants a change of color.</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty normal and these clips do not hold the hair.  The teeth are very small and do not do a good job of grasping the hair and keeping it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve given them another star and a little more time to get used to them.  They are actually not that bad considering the price.  They do the job.</li>
