    <li> It is extremely difficult to get on....almost impossible for me.  have to sprinkle tons of powder in it; I gave up. Would have returned but postage would have cost me half of what the item cost.</li>
    <li> I have some neuro involvement with my large and 2nd toe on my right and the compression feels good and calms the nerves and the gel is also comforting.  I use it on my left foot also, I apply a small amount of lotion and sometimes leave them on all night.  Works well for me.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE LINED WITH A COMFORTABLE &#x27;GEL&#x27; LINING. THEY ARE AS WHITE AS THE DRIVEN SNOW AND SOFT AS SILK, BUT THERE IS NO WAY I COULD GET THEM ON MY FEET&lt;br /&gt;I PULLED AND I TUGGED AND I HUFFED AND I PUFFED, BUT TO NO AVAIL.MY TOES WOULD NOT SEPARATE  ENOUGH TO SLIP THE SOCK ON MY FOOT. THEY ARE BULKY, NICE BUT FIT ON MY TOES? NO WAY, NO HOW.</li>
    <li> weird but works but don&#x27;t last to long wash in sink after used not in the washer</li>
    <li> I purchased these because, for some reason, my smaller toes were essentially almost rolling over and interfering with the next one.  I figured I&#x27;d give these a try to see if the little &amp;#34;sleeves&amp;#34; for each toe would help eliminate the interference and rubbing.  In my case it definitely accomplishes this.  However, with the gel lining it feels like I&#x27;m walking on unstable &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; ground.  The padding gel does take some time to become accustomed.  I&#x27;d also like to mention, your foot really needs to be dry, or so I found, or slipping them on can become a chore....the gel will grab and makes it difficult.</li>
    <li> I could not even get these on my feet..In the garbage they went, I am sorry I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> THEY DON&#x27;T FIT THE FEET TRIED TO USE ON HANDS BUT THEY ARE USELESS..NOT HAPPY WITH THEM AT ALL BAD</li>
    <li> slips off when in bed</li>
    <li> I purchased these thinking they would be just like the ones I ordered thru Amazon from another company.  Nope!  They are very cheaply made, extremely sticky, and wore out inside within 2 or 3 wearings.  They stink, too.  When I wore them they were constantly making a squishy sound.  The gel was like a bubble popping with each step. I had purchased 2 pair, and was able to return the unused pair.  Of course, I had to pay the postage.  I will make sure I don&#x27;t buy from them again.</li>
    <li> This product was a big disappointment.  My first reaction was that the product did not fit my personal needs.  I tried the product a couple of times.  What I need to share with you is the gel inside, without washing not even once, just pealed off.  Very cheaply made.  Once the gel came loose I just pulled out and now I can&#x27;t keep the sock part on as a way to seperate my toes.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> they feel so comfortable, but when I took them off I had a rash.</li>
    <li> yse all the time...feels great</li>
    <li> This foot sock takes a little time getting on but, helped relive the pain in the ball of my foot</li>
    <li> Too bulky under shoes and shows.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife. I also bought the bigger bulkier plastic things that separate the toes. Wife likes these gel socks, she hates the other, they hurt. Resounding endorsement for these then.</li>
    <li> Really works well on my feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several weeks and have not noticed any difference. Dissappointed...was expected at least some results. Can&#x27;t wear inside my shoe either. Wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Hard to put on.  Cannot wear overnight.</li>
    <li> Socks are too bulky and uncomfortable to wear with shoes.&lt;br /&gt;They actually cut off my circulation.&lt;br /&gt;I wear a size seven shoe and the toe holes were way too big for me.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t recommend them, if you have small feet.</li>
    <li> I love these.  When my plantar fasciitis acts up, I put these on for few hours and the pain in the balls of my feet and toes goes away.  The only thing better would be if the toes were closed.  This would prevent them from sliding down on your feet and making a ridge ubder the toes that sort of irritates when you walk.  I also turn them inside out which makes them easier to put on and your toes don&#x27;t feel sweaty and squishy.</li>
    <li> I like this Gel Toe Compression Sock a lot. Now if I can only figure out how to keep it clean. Grime catches on the edge of each toe rim turning it black and greasy.</li>
