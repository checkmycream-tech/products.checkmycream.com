      <li>I think it&#x27;s just one of the best moisturizers ever, makes me love etude house</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great and feels even better on your skin!</li>
      <li>, I know what I am saying because I always buy good cosmetics.</li>
      <li>It is light but the moisture delivery is great!  </li>
      <li>is the best, it&#x27;s very lightly fragranced and it feels very light on my face</li>
      <li>As soon as it dries my skin looks so much more radiant and healthy plus moisturized!!</li>
      <li>Will be buying more when I am done!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>My complexion has gotten better since I have started using this!</li>
      <li>Both products have a nice, pleasant smell - as do most Korean beauty products (eyes, Etude House is Korean).</li>
      <li>a great light scent too.</li>
      <li>These are nice in the sense that they do moisturize the face.</li>
      <li>The cream has a pleasant but light scent.  </li>
      <li>It smells very good, and it moisturize my skin very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good way to try both the essence/serum without having to commit to a huge full-size jar of each.  </li>
      <li>i like their nutrifull products a lot better...</li>
      <li>I love the collagen cream more than the essence product it came with.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a more moisturizing essence, I would look for something else that is richer and thicker.  </li>
      <li>really love the scent for the line.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I guess at 35, I just need a more moisturizing serum?  </li>
      <li>I love the way it plumps my skin up.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the moisturizer</li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>and I just love it.</li>
      <li>Seems more like a lightweight moisturizer that has collagen to help fight wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my favorite product from etude house</li>
      <li>I love all of the Etude House Moistfull Collagen products (I have the night &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; as well!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I have used korean products that contain collagen but are much better, AND does not leave the face sticky.</li>
      <li>The lotion itself is very rich, moisturizing, absorbs quickly, and smells really nice.</li>
      <li>For those who are scent averse, the smell is very light and disappears quickly.</li>
      <li>Non-greasy but super moisturizing; plumps up my skin and keeps it dewy and youthful!</li>
      <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them more than twice a week if your skin isn&#x27;t aging terribly quickly.</li>
      <li>So light,  not greasy.  </li>
      <li>The essence it light as well as the moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Good price for the amount you get (60 ml, which is much more than some creams you get at Sephora for double the price.</li>
      <li>Good for asian skin :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read the reviews of this cream online and most of the reviews are very positive.</li>
      <li>Love this soooo much!  </li>
      <li>I love these products so much!</li>
      <li>Étude house products are wonderful for delicate skin</li>
      <li>So, far really loving this.</li>
      <li>The cream absorbs quickly and immediately softens and smooths my face.  </li>
      <li>The cream absorbs quickly into the skin and moisturizes your skin without the greasy feel.</li>
      <li>And when I first started using it a year ago my friends thought I&#x27;d had work done!</li>
      <li>This came packaged perfectly and arrived on time even a little early.</li>
      <li>Their collagen products are meant more for wrinkle prevention at an early age.</li>
      <li>Only giving this three stars because even though a great product,  I love the products however I received this all ready opened there was no foil on either the moisturizer or essence and the size is deceptive its only travel/sample size of 60ml.</li>
      <li>She also included some cute freebies, which I totally intend to try.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Etude House is a Korean beauty brand meant more for younger women, 20s to 30s.</li>
      <li>No fake.</li>
      <li>They are both rich, but not heavy.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to help with fine lines and apparent wrinkles, Etude House probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I may be young, but these products have actually lessened how my pores look, and they make my skin look nice.</li>
      <li>collagen moistfull line is really great, i recommend it for dry skins to really dry skins.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Okay first of all it is kind of small, but that is the only reason why i didn&#x27;t make</li>
      <li>It really keeps my face moist without being oily.</li>
      <li>but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really improve my skin, but since I paid for it I&#x27;ve just been using that one for under my eyes</li>
      <li>I really like this trial set.  </li>
      <li>I love how this product keeps my dry sensitive skin well hydrated without breaking me out.</li>
      <li>This is a very moisturizing lotion set and it&#x27;s become my new night-time moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I am near 50 and this cream has really done wonders for my face.  </li>
      <li>My t-zone is really oily at night, but my skin was really soft in the morning.</li>
      <li>I like the first essence so much that I want to purchase a bigger size of the product!!</li>
      <li>live without it now</li>
      <li>As far as the cream goes, I found it to be moisturizing enough even at night even though the texture is very light...almost like a gel?  </li>
      <li>Leaves the skin soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>and since using this product she has baby soft skin.</li>
      <li>The serum will last you probably a month or 2, depending on how much you use.</li>
      <li>Devine, so moisturizing, face feels plump soft, I use it every night and after I shower in the morning.</li>
      <li>And do expect to get your items waaaaaaay early.</li>
      <li>I love this cream totally recommend for people with very dry skin or live in dry climates, or olds skin,  i did re purchase for  five times</li>
      <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The essence product is very watery</li>
      <li>So I bought it from A-Poly and it is exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and after using this for a week I am trying a different moisturizer.</li>
      <li>As other people have mentioned, it is small, but its small size also makes it great for traveling.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought this for my mom. Keep in mind that the little bottle of serum is practically a sample. You&#x27;ll maybe get a few days worth of product out of that little thing. Both products have a nice, pleasant smell - as do most Korean beauty products (eyes, Etude House is Korean). According to my mom, the moisturizing is alright. Seems more like a lightweight moisturizer that has collagen to help fight wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Etude House is a Korean beauty brand meant more for younger women, 20s to 30s. If you&#x27;re looking for something to help with fine lines and apparent wrinkles, Etude House probably isn&#x27;t for you. Their collagen products are meant more for wrinkle prevention at an early age.</li>
    <li> everything came on time and in great condition. The essence it light as well as the moisturizer. a great light scent too. will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love these products so much! It really keeps my face moist without being oily. I like the first essence so much that I want to purchase a bigger size of the product!!</li>
    <li> Received an expired product</li>
    <li> i like their nutrifull products a lot better... this makes my skin sticky and doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin either...</li>
    <li> It made my skin break out.</li>
    <li> I have heard that Korean beauty products are the best and this product did not disappoint.  I am near 50 and this cream has really done wonders for my face.  People have said that my face looks like it is glowing, and this is no joke!  The cream absorbs quickly and immediately softens and smooths my face.  Will be buying more when I am done!</li>
    <li> Five stars! I love this cream. I works great. Bought this for my mother she said she had really dry skin and since using this product she has baby soft skin. The seller Katie The Babe is magnificent. She ships your order out as soon as she gets your order. And do expect to get your items waaaaaaay early. Love it!</li>
    <li> It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but works well regardless. They are both rich, but not heavy. My t-zone is really oily at night, but my skin was really soft in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great gel-cream for day or night. The cream absorbs quickly into the skin and moisturizes your skin without the greasy feel. The cream has a pleasant but light scent.  Good price for the amount you get (60 ml, which is much more than some creams you get at Sephora for double the price. As an added bonus, you get a small bottle of essence that you can use before applying serum, or by itself.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and feels even better on your skin! I have oily skin that is dehydrated. This stuff gives my skin the hydration it needs. I love the way it plumps my skin up. My skin feels hydrated and younger.</li>
    <li> Fasts shipping. Leaves the skin soft and moisturized. Étude house products are wonderful for delicate skin and I just love it.</li>
    <li> Okay first of all it is kind of small, but that is the only reason why i didn&#x27;t make it a 5.&lt;br /&gt;Smells Devine, so moisturizing, face feels plump soft, I use it every night and after I shower in the morning. My complexion has gotten better since I have started using this! I think it&#x27;s just one of the best moisturizers ever, makes me love etude house even more.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without it now</li>
    <li> These are nice in the sense that they do moisturize the face. If you put these on before bed time, you WILL wake up with slightly softer skin. However, I have used korean products that contain collagen but are much better, AND does not leave the face sticky. With these, I have to layer on another moisturizer, otherwise I feel like my face just sticks to the pillow. It feels really heavy and thick too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviews said, these are very small, but you really don&#x27;t need that much. The serum will last you probably a month or 2, depending on how much you use. The cream will last you probably a few months.</li>
    <li> I love the collagen cream more than the essence product it came with. And when you receive the package it is a very small amount, however a little does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The essence product is very watery but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really improve my skin, but since I paid for it I&#x27;ve just been using that one for under my eyes and them I put the cream all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is the best, it&#x27;s very lightly fragranced and it feels very light on my face and oh my pants are there improvements in my skin complexion!! As soon as it dries my skin looks so much more radiant and healthy plus moisturized!! I will definitely be purchasing the cream again when I&#x27;m done with this small container.</li>
    <li> Love this soooo much!  It&#x27;s my third order and I&#x27;m going to keep buying it. No one can guess my age! And when I first started using it a year ago my friends thought I&#x27;d had work done!</li>
    <li> This came two weeks after I ordered in the peak of Black Friday online shopping. She also included some cute freebies, which I totally intend to try. The lotion itself is very rich, moisturizing, absorbs quickly, and smells really nice. For those who are scent averse, the smell is very light and disappears quickly. So, far really loving this.</li>
    <li> I really like this trial set.  It&#x27;s a good way to try both the essence/serum without having to commit to a huge full-size jar of each.  I LOVE the moisturizer but I am lukewarm about the essence.  I guess at 35, I just need a more moisturizing serum?  It just seems a bit too watery for me, but it does work well for during the day since I apply additional stuff on my face such as sunblock and BB cream (when I wear makeup).  If you are looking for a more moisturizing essence, I would look for something else that is richer and thicker.  As far as the cream goes, I found it to be moisturizing enough even at night even though the texture is very light...almost like a gel?  I may end up having to switch to a thicker cream in the winter, but this is an excellent choice for summer!  It is light but the moisture delivery is great!  Non-greasy but super moisturizing; plumps up my skin and keeps it dewy and youthful!</li>
    <li> This combo of cream and essence makes my skin plump and hydrated for at least a few days after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, always wash your face in the morning if you have used this at night, so that you can let your skin breathe!&lt;br /&gt;But I love all of the Etude House Moistfull Collagen products (I have the night &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; as well!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be young, but these products have actually lessened how my pores look, and they make my skin look nice. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them more than twice a week if your skin isn&#x27;t aging terribly quickly. It has, however, mostly gotten rid of the worry lines on my forehead, so that is awesome!</li>
    <li> This cream (used with the entire line of course) makes you skin prepares for winter cold.&lt;br /&gt;The collagen moistfull line is really great, i recommend it for dry skins to really dry skins.&lt;br /&gt;I really love the scent for the line.</li>
    <li> Really good product! I&#x27;ve read the reviews of this cream online and most of the reviews are very positive. So I bought it from A-Poly and it is exactly what I expected. It smells very good, and it moisturize my skin very well.</li>
    <li> This came packaged perfectly and arrived on time even a little early. This is my favorite product from etude house but I am worried as it is getting harder to find. It works wonderful. Etude has never let me down.</li>
    <li> Only giving this three stars because even though a great product,  I love the products however I received this all ready opened there was no foil on either the moisturizer or essence and the size is deceptive its only travel/sample size of 60ml.</li>
    <li> I love this cream totally recommend for people with very dry skin or live in dry climates, or olds skin,  i did re purchase for  five times</li>
    <li> Got the wrong item. Order the enriched moistfull and didn&#x27;t  even get that. The serum that I got  leak half way. Waited 4 weeks for this and got the wrong item.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and after using this for a week I am trying a different moisturizer. My skin is rough and I am breaking out on my forehead. I bought this in conjunction with the wonderpore toner and I am not sure which is to blame.</li>
    <li> This is a very moisturizing lotion set and it&#x27;s become my new night-time moisturizer. As other people have mentioned, it is small, but its small size also makes it great for traveling.</li>
    <li> Love this product. So light,  not greasy.  In fact I already got my second order in the mail. Good for asian skin :)</li>
    <li> Mandatory have item. No fake. Great seller.Awesome production, best moisturizer, I know what I am saying because I always buy good cosmetics.I permanently buy Etude House items, they do not contain harmful elements like: Paraben, Mineral, Telk and Benzophenon. Just start buying Etude House items and forget about others</li>
    <li> I love how this product keeps my dry sensitive skin well hydrated without breaking me out.</li>
