      <li>I get so many compliments on how healthy and great my hair looks.</li>
      <li>I have liked all the Hair Rules products that I have tried:</li>
      <li>I have not found anything better.</li>
      <li>I wanted to sport a short curly &#x27;fro&#x27; for the summer season and this product ALONE gave me great curl definition!!!  </li>
      <li>And if your hair has a tendency for dryness, you will love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair hydrated better when added with the leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>it was ok i need more moisture</li>
      <li>Makes my hair perfect after I let it dry curly</li>
      <li>have curly hair, so this product really helps keep hair together for a nice clean, shiny finish!</li>
      <li>After finishing cream was applied, I sat under the dryer for about 40 minutes (even though my hair is about 3 inches in length)and fabulous results: a well defined curl in</li>
      <li>Yes, it took a while under the dryer, but well worth it!</li>
      <li>It leave my hair nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my hair feel so soft and easy to detangle.</li>
      <li>After being natural for the last 8 years or so, I&#x27;ve tried more than my fair share of hair products.  </li>
      <li>Smooths hair and comes in a nice big bottle.</li>
      <li>This line of hair care products have really upped my ability to focus on other things and count on my hair looking great.  </li>
      <li>this is just the right weight of product that doenst leave his hair greasy or pasted to his head..</li>
      <li>Fast delivery , it very light , makes my hair feel soft .</li>
      <li>My hair is a little crisp to the touch after application, but my curls do stay in shape and look good when I use it.</li>
      <li>It adds moisture that makes it pliable and looking fresh even on the most dry of winter days.</li>
      <li>This combination is the only thing that leaves my curls touchable, soft, hydrated, and beautiful all day long.  </li>
      <li>The scent is a bit strong for a final hair product.</li>
      <li>I only use a small dab of Hair Rules and happiness ensues every time!</li>
      <li>I believe that every person has a product or group of products that really speak to them.</li>
      <li>I  imagine it would work well on straight hair too.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair which flattens at night and gets frizzy.  </li>
      <li>Really like the product</li>
      <li>I have the whole Hair Rules set.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many other leave-ins.</li>
      <li>Curly hair is delicate and needs special love and attention.  </li>
      <li>The leave in conditioner alone (with a little natural oil) works far better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the same for all of us curly girls, and you really do have to kiss a lot of frogs.  </li>
      <li>It is not real thick and it has a plant smell.</li>
      <li>Not sure what the newly formulated product will be, but the current finishing creme (made with petroleum and mineral oil) sits on top of my African American natural hair and dries my hair out.</li>

    <li> I have very curly hair which flattens at night and gets frizzy.  I apply a very small amount of this in the morning  and it makes my hair come alive.  Can separate the curls and it&#x27;s nice and shiny.  Also like the lemony smell.  I  imagine it would work well on straight hair too.  Use only a tiny amount.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I finally found a product that leaves my curly hair looking moist, moveable and shiny, not dried out and stiff.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this hair cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair, so this product really helps keep hair together for a nice clean, shiny finish!</li>
    <li> Hair rules Hydrating finishing cream is a wounderful product !!! My nick name for it is my Hair Crack.     LaMar</li>
    <li> Makes my hair perfect after I let it dry curly or when I style it. Puts just enough weight but not heavy enough to weigh hair down at all and it seems to define my curls perfectly. I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair and sometimes the ends get a little out of control. I only use a small dab of Hair Rules and happiness ensues every time!</li>
    <li> Above and beyond what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I like this product! It leave my hair nice and soft. It is not real thick and it has a plant smell.</li>
    <li> Too heavy for my hair type.</li>
    <li> This cream is great I do use it in combination with curly whip for maximum curl. once your hair dry you will achieve a salon look</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair hydrated better when added with the leave in conditioner. Really like the product</li>
    <li> Fast delivery , it very light , makes my hair feel soft . Doesn&#x27;t have a product build up</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my hair, or anybody&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday.  It makes my curls springy and my hair shiny.  The portion of my hair that tends to dry out and frizz LOVES this stuff.  I have invested well over $400 on trying various curl support products after I decided to shelve the flat iron and wear what God gave me.  This product comes in #1.  I have liked all the Hair Rules products that I have tried: Daily Cleansing Cream (non-suds shampoo), and Curly Whip because parts of my hair get saggy, and this product.  I also like some of the Ouidad stuff.  Don&#x27;t waste your money at the supermarket if you have curly hair.  Curly hair is delicate and needs special love and attention.  Find what works for you.  And if your hair has a tendency for dryness, you will love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My son has curly/wavy hair.. this is just the right weight of product that doenst leave his hair greasy or pasted to his head..</li>
    <li> I wanted to sport a short curly &#x27;fro&#x27; for the summer season and this product ALONE gave me great curl definition!!!  I have kinky curly hair and my stylist ONLY used the hydrating finishing cream after a thorough shampoo and conditioning.  After finishing cream was applied, I sat under the dryer for about 40 minutes (even though my hair is about 3 inches in length)and fabulous results: a well defined curl in it&#x27;s dry state!  Yes, it took a while under the dryer, but well worth it! Now I can go to the gym and not have to think about how I will maintain the look!  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I am African American/Hispanic woman with chemically treated long curly hair. I&#x27;ve been struggling with my hair being really dry, brittle, with excessive breakage. I was using oils and read an article that said my hair needed moisture and lacked hydration. I started researching products and found Hair Rules Hydrating Finishing Cream. I am so glad I did. I noticed an instant difference from the moment I put it on my hair. This has brought life back to my hair and has help stop the breakage. My hair no longer looks dry and brittle. I get so many compliments on how healthy and great my hair looks. I can&#x27;t even begin to touch on how great my hair feels. This product is a must have for all African American Women.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe my hair likes this cream. I let my hair air dry and then tried to put in the finishing cream. My hair felt hard and the cream was not easy to apply all throughout my hair. This isn&#x27;t for me. :( Im truly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have the whole Hair Rules set. I love how it makes my hair feel so soft and easy to detangle. I use this product to retwist my hair at night and sometimes in the morning when untwisting. It keeps my hair hydrated and I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> smells weird, too strong and makes my hair feel like straw</li>
    <li> it was ok i need more moisture</li>
    <li> Still not sure how to use it. I wear a scarf so wash and go works, but my hair stays wet. Gotta figure out a way. I have not found anything better.</li>
    <li> Smooths hair and comes in a nice big bottle.</li>
    <li> After being natural for the last 8 years or so, I&#x27;ve tried more than my fair share of hair products.  I believe that every person has a product or group of products that really speak to them. It&#x27;s not the same for all of us curly girls, and you really do have to kiss a lot of frogs.  I have tried so many other leave-ins. They all leave my hair either crunchy, perfumed, greasy, parched, flaky, or powdery. This combination is the only thing that leaves my curls touchable, soft, hydrated, and beautiful all day long.  This line of hair care products have really upped my ability to focus on other things and count on my hair looking great.  I mix this with an equal amount of the nourishment leave-in creme every day.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It fully moisturizes and revives my curls. I can now go beyond day 2 hair with this.</li>
    <li> I researched Anthony Dickey and his products before purchasing.  I went to his salon and had a great experience.  His products are awesome.  The finishing cream does not leave the hair feeling greasy and it gives a nice shine that lasts.  Yes, the products are a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for...all of Dickey&#x27;s products are great!  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My hair definitely appreciates it. It adds moisture that makes it pliable and looking fresh even on the most dry of winter days.</li>
    <li> My hair is a little crisp to the touch after application, but my curls do stay in shape and look good when I use it. The scent is a bit strong for a final hair product.</li>
    <li> Waist of money.  Leaves my hair with no shine.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the newly formulated product will be, but the current finishing creme (made with petroleum and mineral oil) sits on top of my African American natural hair and dries my hair out. It also dulls my hair--definintely no shine. The leave in conditioner alone (with a little natural oil) works far better. The curly cream is also good for shine.</li>
