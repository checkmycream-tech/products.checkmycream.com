<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Im Caucasian andarried into a latino family. This helps... my legs anyway:)</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this I saw a lot of people talking about the scent and how it was too much. I actually love the smell. It is very floral, some have said gardenia scented, and as long as you don&#x27;t dump it on, it smells great!</li>
    <li> love it!!!! The bronze glow it give my pale legs it beautiful!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing. There isn&#x27;t any shimmer or bronze color when applied to my skin. The smell is nice and is the only reason I gave it one star.</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels great! I even used it right after shaving my legs and I didn&#x27;t get a rash (which I normally get if I use lotion right after).</li>
    <li> Arrived LATE! Not as good as the product description, greasy and couldn&#x27;t tell it was on</li>
    <li> I am african american. I love a good sun kissed glow to my skin esspecially in the winter months. This was just ok. It has no staying power, other than the smell of it which is hard to place but not something I would choose to wear. It is very light, and has a light shimmer but you have to use quite a bit of it. I feel like a shimmer body powder would work just as well, but without the heavy fragrance. They may be a bit more mess but I think it would give the same result.</li>
    <li> My friend turned me on to this and if you want to have  J -low Glow that dries and does not stain this is it!</li>
    <li> this smells SO SO GOOD- like roses. I don&#x27;t see much of a shimmer- but I get a little bit of bronzing from the oil which is nice. I like that it&#x27;s available for subscribe and save too. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to continue with it as a bronzer but definitely as a body oil/perfume. It&#x27;s really pretty. It doesn&#x27;t list ingredients so it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s drying my hands but it feels nice and the oil stays oily so that&#x27;s good?</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome, it looks weird and unusual but it works great!</li>
    <li> For me this stuff is amazing! When you first put it on it may seem like there is no big difference but after a few minutes I could tell the difference from my leg color and foot color. Love it! And it has a great smell!</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments on my tan legs (which never tan).  Gives great, subtle gold shimmer--not chunky glitter.  The oil absorbs quickly, no need to walk around naked waiting for it to dry.  Smells like someone&#x27;s Grandma&#x27;s bathroom.  I tried to cover it up with essentail oils and wasted LOTS of oil with no noticeable change in scent.  I don&#x27;t understand the flowery Grandma smell--why not coconut or something tropical?  Its worth it for the look.  No one has mentioned that I smell like a Grandma yet, but they are jealous of my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  The bottle is glass, which could be tricky with oily hands--I dropped it once on tile, but its so thick it was unharmed.</li>
    <li> love it and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I thought I would love this but couldn&#x27;t get past the fragrance. If you want a tan look, it doesn&#x27;t do much for that either. Very light shimmer. The smell is too floral, gardenia &amp; rose but way too much of it! Reminded me of my grandmas perfume. I think something like this should have a tropical smell to remind you of the beach, like coconut. Hated this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I&#x27;ve given some to my good friends and they love it too. I use this bronzer all the time for my own enjoyment. It&#x27;s a dry oil, so there is a such thing as too much, it will collect in creases. But it&#x27;s not necessary to use a lot. The color isn&#x27;t strong, it just adds a pretty tone. It smells beautiful. I was nervous when other reviewers referred to the scent as floral, but I disagree. It&#x27;s sweeter than floral, but not fruity and alittle make-upy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me much darker but is still a nice product. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It is perfect for the summer because it gives you that extra glow, without the staining of a typical bronzer! It&#x27;s not greasy and lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to give any bronzing effect, but does leave a nice sparkle. Light weight, not super oily. I would probably opt for a darker shade though. I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in color.</li>
    <li> Really overestimated this product, gave a nice shimmer but did nothing to male my legs appear tan.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m spoiled from using TANtalizer Bronzer by Lorac from Sephora. I was looking for something less expensive so I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfumed very strongly and the color separates from the liquid so it doesn&#x27;t adequately tan your skin. I am throwing it out as&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not usable. I was happily surprised to find the price has decreased for Tantalizer Bronzer so I ordered it and the last tube lasted five years so&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m all set. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product unless you just want glitter. I am Caucasian and ordered the regular tantalizer&lt;br /&gt;which provides the look of a good tan with luminizer.</li>
    <li> does not give as nice of a bronze color as I was expecting, however still a nice oil based rub</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the smell the bronze effect is nice &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Bad smell.....and messy. Will never purchase again. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!! (key is to shake the bottle up really well, prior to using) It goes on evenly and isn&#x27;t super pigmented, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about streaks or too much color in one area.  Nice even tint of color with a sun-kissed glow.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Wish it came out easier, maybe had a pump on top?</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, product is as appears!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell of this product as much as some of the others who have reviewed it. It did give my legs a nice shine, but this is NOT a self tanner. The before and after pictures that I have seen on the Internet are deceiving. You will see a slight difference in the shade of your skin but mostly you will just get a nice shimmer.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed i am very white and it showed no color what so ever. The smell is horrible.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on; comes off on anything my legs touch. Very shinny, not subtle.</li>
    <li> Not a &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; more a shimmer makeup for skin. You need to layer it on to really see the shimmer or color.  It washes off.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your skin so gorgeous and I love the light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great product! You&#x27;ve got to have it for the summer. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.  The oil formula actually gives hydration to the skin and the shimmer gives a great summer glow.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but will not buy again</li>
    <li> I loved how it looked but it smelled a little funny. Not terrible just a little weird. I still use it and it looks great!</li>
    <li> this bronzer is amazing, and I do not wear just  any bronzer, it does not smell or turn your skin orange, the shipping was fast and prompt... thank you...</li>
    <li> Product is great and gives you a natural looking tan</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of glow and shimmer.  Does not look like something a teenager would wear easy to apply and I have not had any problems with product transfer on to clothing or furniture.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much !!! It smells wonderful, not messy. Gives skin that summer glow !!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they call this a shimmering body oil...there&#x27;s no shimmer at all and the hideous gardenia smell reminds me of my grandma.</li>
    <li> Very thin consitency; did not offer any enhancement/glow.</li>
    <li> When the John Frieda \\&quot;Beach Blonde\\&quot; gold hair gel was discontinued I was looking for something that I could use on my hair to give me a gold glint and some shine. Found it here with this product. Bonus points - the smell is really reminiscent of the suntan lotion aisle in a Miami Beach corner drug store. Well done, Body Shop.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews that the product had a yucky scent.  It makes your skin pretty when you rub it on but as someone who easily gets headaches from strong scents, I have not mustered the strength to use this product.  I think I would need nose plugs and also need to hand them out to people around me if I decided to use it.</li>
    <li> Does not add much, if any, color to your legs. I would never buy this product again. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It definitely gives me confidence when I go out to wear this on my legs. It gives them an airbrushed look. Love it. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This product smells horrible and with no shimmer at all. I applied it and it&#x27;s just a nasty smelling oil. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Just like I expected it</li>
    <li> The product is great and arrived as stated by seller.</li>
    <li> A bit of a shipping delay but made right by seller.  Love this bronzer!  Smells wonderful and leaves just the right amount of color.</li>
    <li> I can not stand the smell of this product. Looks great but not good enough for me to endure the stench!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!</li>
    <li> My only disappointment in this product is how it comes out of the bottle. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s a glass bottle and all but you cant squeeze any out you have to shake and shake and you still only get a little bit out.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was sceptical at first but I am 49 yrs old and avoid the sun. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I applied it. The color is  great and the oil makes my skin look and feel really nice. I have had many compliments on my skin when I have it on. I dont really like the smell, but it is not offensive. I will continue to use it and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this, I read the reviews warning about the very strong &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; smell and I both agree and disagree with that statement. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s so much as a floral scent but more of a cheap perfume smell but yes, it is a really strong, not-so-pleasant scent. I didn&#x27;t find this product to do much bronzing- perhaps if you have really fair skin it may work for you but I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. What I did notice was how greasy I was after using it on just one arm. Definitely can&#x27;t imagine putting it all over my body. This product was a bit of bummer for me!</li>
    <li> very nice.  does not make you orange. wish it lasted longer than 1 shower.  overall great product easy to use</li>
    <li> just as described, very easy to apply.... my skin is sensitive and it never has bothered me at all... hardly&lt;br /&gt;any smell and looks great</li>
    <li> I really like the smell. I have only used the product a few times and have been conservative in how much I am applying; I could probably use more for a more dramatic difference but I like the shimmery glow. Once/if I have more of a natural, base tan, I&#x27;m sure it would look even better..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a good deal on it, so overall, I would buy it again. Though it should be noted to be careful when applying and when you put any layers on as it is very brown/orange when you wash your hands after, etc.</li>
    <li> Ugh, this is so heavily scented and a HUGE turn-off!!! The product itself isn&#x27;t bad. Gives a pretty glow to skin...hence the two stars. I can&#x27;t get past the smell. My husband came upstairs and immediately said, &amp;quot;What stinks??&amp;quot; Horrible. It might not be so bad if the stink dissipated but it lasts for HOURS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this at all. Too bad.</li>
    <li> How does anyone get passed the smell of this stuff? It&#x27;s awful and the effect is so minimal it is certainly not worth the smell of the money.</li>
    <li> I love how this dry oil makes my legs feel and look. It feels luxurious and glamorous and accents a my fair skin nicely. I kind of hoped it would make my skin seem darker (I&#x27;m trying to be sun safe these days and not tan much at all) but it just adds a light iridescent shimmer. It also was a bit pricy for a very subtle result. Regardless, it still looks and feels fancy so I&#x27;ll keep wearing and enjoying it and the nice shimmery glow it gives me.</li>
    <li> if you put on enough to make you look nice and bronzy, it gets very wet and rubs off on everything. MOstly just the oil rubs off though, the color stays on your skin very well. i really like it for those days you want to look extra glowy.</li>
    <li> love this product, the smell is awesome and makes your legs look great. would reccommend</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t show up at all. No shimmer, no tan. Strong floral (magnolia) scent. Kind of reminded me of my Great Aunt Magnolin&#x27;s perfume...</li>
    <li> Product was as expected</li>
    <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers that the smell is not good. It does go away after a few hours. I like that this goes on easily, isn&#x27;t super messy, and gives me just enough of a bronze that I don&#x27;t look like a dorito. Always a plus.</li>
    <li> Loved using this for my pale legs but always got paranoid about it leaving stains on my clothes or towels.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Just the right amount of bronze with a great smell. Not greasy at all!!! Word to the wise let it soak in for a minute before getting dressed :)</li>
    <li> sweeter than honey! Argh!</li>
    <li> First time user, but I happy with it.</li>
    <li> Gives you hardly any color. smells awful. Not worth it to me!</li>
    <li> BE SURE TO GIVE A GOOD SHAKE AS IT SEPARATES IN THE BOTTLE.  NICE COVERAGE, BUT A MESS ON THE SHEETS :(</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. This product is nothing more than oil, oil, and oil. There is no color or bronzing affect.</li>
    <li> Had high expectations from the ads and it really disappointed me. It is a nice oil for your skin but there was no before and after look, nothing was different. I used it over a slight tan and although my skin was softer, there wasn&#x27;t a drop of bronzing to see. I feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> All the reviews that I read were right on. This is great for year-round use. Goes on easy and looks great!</li>
    <li> I expected this to have a little more of a bronzing effect.  I&#x27;m extremely pale so if there was any bronzing ingredients in it, it would have shown on my skin.  It does make your skin shimmer, but almost to the point of looking oily.  And it&#x27;s quite messy!  A squeeze bottle would have been better.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Alot goes along way, very subtle, but just enough to add color.  And yes it does dry dry, no feeling like your slather in tanning products.</li>
    <li> Came sooner than expected time. Very pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> Really oily. Didn&#x27;t work as well as they say it does.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice and a good amount of shimmer--not too much. It smells nice but a bit too strong of a fragrance for me.</li>
    <li> The bronze color is just the right color.  Not too sparkly and not orange at all, it looks natural.</li>
    <li> wow new fav skin product, perfect for your legs when wearing a dress, gives you a pretty glow with too much sparkle like other shimmer oils</li>
    <li> I have olive skin and tan easily so I can&#x27;t say this gives me any color but I love the smell and people always compliment me and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite ways to give myself a glow of tan without any unscreened sun exposure. A couple of basal cell skin cancers have left me very careful to screen myself well from the sun, but I miss the glow of a tan. This product supplies that glow, and it lasts several days or until my next shower, when I re-apply it. It blends in and looks natural if you rub it in on knees and ankles and the tops of feet. I love using it on my shoulders and arms, and if I can get my husband to help, on my back. Do know that it has a strong floral smell that dissipates over the first hour or two. You&#x27;ll either love the scent or hate it. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t trigger my migraines like some scents, but I can&#x27;t speak for others. This is a regular part of my post-shower routine, a must do in shorts weather, but now I&#x27;m hooked and use it year round.</li>
    <li> Love the way it enhancement leg in a dress.  Would like to see another shade darker</li>
    <li> Smells good. But no real effect of bronze...</li>
    <li> This product was a disappointment.  It simply doesn&#x27;t work.  It applies evenly but leaves no noticeable color and wears off easily - which leads to concern regarding discoloration on clothing.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, gives a nice shine to skin, dry oil helps feel nice. Doesn&#x27;t make you look tanner.</li>
    <li> smells absolutely terrible. A shame because the color is beautiful. But the smell lingers for hours, I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep with the smell on me.</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful but the smell is so unplesant I can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> This was an amazing product. It made me shimmery and tan. Thank you. (:</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews about this product and having a reputable magazine give it a good report, I thought confident in ordering.  I did not think the fragrance of the lotion was over-powering at all, which a lot of consumers complained about.  The coverage, however, was very disappointing.  I am fair skinned and it did nothing for me.  My original fear was that I would look \\&quot;made up\\&quot;.  Instead, my legs barely showed any change in color.  I will try again and put it on more generously to see if I did not use it correctly, but it should be a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> The color was minimal and the smell was so overpowering I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to wear it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright product. I saw this on Pinterest but it wasn&#x27;t quite as magnificent as Pinterest made it look.</li>
    <li> gives a little bit of shimmer and color</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It gives your skin just the right amount of shimmery bronze - it&#x27;s not orange at all.  I use it whenever I go out and I always get compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> it dribbles out. doesn&#x27;t do as well as some of the reviews here stated. Its not the quality I expected. I kind of feel that the reviews might be staged.</li>
    <li> Wonderful item, I will be buying more like it in the future.  The product was as expected and was as advertized.</li>
    <li> Cant wait for summer to use it:)</li>
    <li> Not very much shimmer. And does not have any tint to it. It&#x27;s basically dry oil. Really bummed.</li>
    <li> It has a strong scent that is kind of flowery.  It&#x27;s not my favorite smell but it&#x27;s okay.  But if you want to wear perfume it might conflict with the scent from this bronzer, especially if you are putting it on your upper body.  The bronze effect is very subtle so it&#x27;s seriously for really fair girls who want a very slight bronze as it isn&#x27;t the most buildable.  But it is moisturizing, a plus.</li>
    <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t really give much color.</li>
    <li> Smells like an old lady and it&#x27;s very strong. I can&#x27;t get past the scent!! Why didnt I return this???</li>
    <li> The fragrance is pleasant and it gives just enough bronze to have a natural look. Will purchase again in the future</li>
    <li> does great job bronzing!! Careful if you do sweat it Does come off.</li>
    <li> love this!! use it all the time!!</li>
    <li> This is a great bronzer if you don&#x27;t want streaking or that fake look.  There is a very subtle smell which reminds me of gardenias...</li>
    <li> I read about this bronzer and decided to purchase it. This bronzer has just a hint of shimmer, which I like!</li>
    <li> I do like the bronzer...however you only see a hint of coverage..I like the dry oil...I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do - give you a mild bronze/shimmer effect. I have light olive skin and I noticed it the most on my arms where I already have a base tan while my pastey white legs didn&#x27;t get the effect I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent doesn&#x27;t match the rest of the fruity scents I tend to wear so take note when picking out your perfume if you&#x27;re covering your skin in this. You might not even want to wear any other scents on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shimmer effect was much stronger in the store compared to the lighting I have at home and when outside. I&#x27;d buy it again but only for the summer months.</li>
    <li> I like how it is easy to apply and is not greasy at all. Gives my legs a nice sun kissed look.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this because I thought it would give me color. I bought it for a little shimmer. The smell is nice and if you&#x27;re planning to wear it alone with no other scents its fine. The problem I have is that I don&#x27;t notice much shimmer, the oil is nice but I guess either I&#x27;m not putting enough on or it&#x27;s really not that shimmery. I&#x27;ll have to use it more often to know for sure.</li>
    <li> It has a very very strong smelll and the color is not what I expected it to be, it is much lighter. It does give a nice shimmer and moisturizes but for some reason i expected more.</li>
    <li> Super excited!! Wonderful smell!! Goes on easily without streaks!!</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail. This stuff smells awful. I thought the other reviewers may have been sensitive about the scent. Absolutely not. It is pungent and totally offends my senses. I&#x27;m going to leave this bottle for anyone who wants it in my work bathroom. What a disappointment. I really wanted to love it.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding Honey Bronze after buying it at JC Penneys,which they discontinued selling it at their stores. I was happy I found it at Amazon. I don&#x27;t want to be without it. I love the glow it gives to my face after applying my makeup.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love, love, love these product. It gives u such a great shimmer. I don&#x27;t care to much for the smell because it&#x27;s Gardenia but other than that I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> overpowering fragrance, made legs look shimmery not bronze at all.</li>
    <li> it turned my skin orange. not happy at all</li>
    <li> I had hoped for more shimmer.  The product does at a bit of color and shimmer.  It is strongly scented as well.  It isn&#x27;t a bad scent, but I wouldn&#x27;t wear perfume too when using it.</li>
    <li> Great item.  I use it on my legs for a healthy glow and shine.  I am very fair skinned and it doesn&#x27;t make me orange or any other color besides a glow.  It is not supposed to be used on your face, although some reviewers say they do.  I would not reccomend this practice.  However, if you are looking for a subtle glow and shine, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Smells like hair cheap grease and that is my only complaint with this. I am already quite tan but I feel it gives my skina beautiful bronze glow so I try to us it whenever I have a lot of skin to show. Wish the product was scent free, probably will not pruchase again.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing for a light to medium complexion black person! I was more so looking for something with shimmer almost glitter without being loud. This has NO shimmer at all. As far as the bronze NOTHING. I did take into consideration that I am already nicely tanned from sports and outdoor activities but come on, no bronze or shimmer as they call it. I was very disappointed and requested a return immediately after trying a section of my arm. (The lightest part of my arm). Perhaps a white person may have better results. I should call up a few of my friends and have them try it out. Oh well onto something else.</li>
    <li> This works great and gives a Suttle amount of color.</li>
    <li> This dry oil has a horrendous smell. It does not give a faux tan, but it does provide a nice shimmer to the skin. If you use this product, I recommend putting it the night before you wish to wear it out that way the smell has time to fade overnight.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell and turns you Orange</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this, I worried that the shimmer along with the dark tint would make my pale, pasty legs look weird. But, seeing as I&#x27;m not into the sun, (at all), nor am I into the commitment, (or possible oranginess), of a self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;This is wonderful, amazing stuff. It smells delicious. It is not scary shimmery, more of a nice glow. And the bronze color isn&#x27;t at all what I thought, it&#x27;s subtle, indiscernible, but takes my legs to a whole other lever.&lt;br /&gt;The oil isn&#x27;t oily, it sinks right into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is now my skirt or short wearing essential.</li>
    <li> You have to use a ton of the stuff for it to even show a color difference...and I&#x27;m really pale.</li>
