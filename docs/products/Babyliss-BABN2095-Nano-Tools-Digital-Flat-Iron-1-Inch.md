<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Some of the reviews were less than flattering, but my stylist recommended these flat irons.  I have wavy/curly hair and blow dry and finish with the straightener.  It heats up very fast and does a great job.  My style holds much better.  I live in the South so humidity is definitely a battle, but unless I stand outside for extended period of times, my hair keeps it&#x27;s style.  I love the memory setting so it&#x27;s no work to set the temp that works best for me.  Definitely hotter than a consumer flat iron!</li>
    <li> Great product, does not fry my hair and heats up very quickly. I would highly recommend this flat iron for short hair.</li>
    <li> Great tool for the price.  Leaves your hair softer than most flat irons and glides easily; doesn&#x27;t make your hair like straw after styling.</li>
    <li> My previous Babyliss flat iron quit working and I ordered this one.  I was not disappointed.  Same great qualtiy, same superior performance.  For me there is only one flat iron and that&#x27;s a Babyliss.  Worth every penny.  Definitely will purchase another one in the future and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a future professional at Paul Mitchell the school Bradley and my smoothing iron had broken. So I ordered this product because one of the representatives came to the school promoting Babyliss. I am HAPPY to say that I am pleased with this product!! It heats up, no lie, in seconds!!! This is AWESOME for me! Cannot wait to open my salon and order more Babyliss products! ♡♡♡♡♡ them! Ooh,  and they got to me VERY quick!</li>
    <li> Really pleased with the performance of this flat iron. Heats up very fast and does a beautiful job on&lt;br /&gt;straightening and smoothing. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Babyliss products for over 4 years now and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. I just recently ordered this replacement for the titanium pro Babyliss, which worked for 4 years. All these other reviews about the products being fake, I really don&#x27;t understand. My new flat iron works just like a Babyliss should so for all you that are on the fence about purchasing any Babyliss products, start with this one first. If you&#x27;re disappointed it wont be like you wasted a ton of money. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Dose not keep set temp.&lt;br /&gt;I have had it all most a year and used very little. It has burned the end of my hair because it always goes up to hottest temp.&lt;br /&gt;Also when I received it it was in a damaged shipping box although the box the iron was in looked o.k.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the jaring during the shipping did make a difference in the heat setting I do not know. I just know I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser recommended this brand.</li>
    <li> LOVE this flat iron. It heats fast and has a nice long cord. But best of all it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and leaves it soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the bes flat iron I´ve ever had</li>
    <li> My hair dresser used this on my hair and I feel in love with it. I went right on line and ordered me one. For the price it&#x27;s a awesome Flat Iron.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to get this to try out and finally have a good straightener.  Too many passes at getting it straightened.  If you it less hair, it can&#x27;t grip it.  It hurt my hand when trying to keep the hair held well between the atta</li>
    <li> love this straightener  arrived a little slower than I hoped for but still before the lastest shipment date. my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy anymore</li>
    <li> The plates get really hot. I like the flat irons in general .The only reason I&#x27;m not giving a 5 star is because the white on the flat irons is starting to chip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Chi, and Hairart but this Babyliss is the best flat iron ever! I like the thickness of the plastic and the plates smooth out my hair. My hair is growing faster than when I used other flat irons.</li>
    <li> The only thing i did not like, its that it gets too hot on the top where i need to put my hand to press down, i have to put my hands more at tge handle, it over all a good straightener. That&#x27;s why i gave it a 4 .</li>
    <li> Great product easy to use</li>
    <li> I have problems with flat irons catching on that one hair that doesn&#x27;t make it in with the other strands. I have purchased four other irons, but this one has exceeded my expectations! It literally GLIDES through my slightly frizzy hair, and never catches or pulls.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because several of my friends had bought a Babyliss and we&#x27;re bragging about how good they were. Because of the price I was skeptical. But wow! I have very curly frizzy hair. This product heats up to maximum in seconds. One pass with this straightener and done.  I have had a Chi,  Coroilisss, and GVP. This one puts those to shame.  Get this one. You will not regret it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Really was looking forward to a new flat iron. This one looks and feels real good, but did not flatten my semi thin wavy/curly hair. It did not hold the temperature.</li>
    <li> Works great. Tap my roots three times and slide down my hair once. Love it</li>
    <li> love it! works great and my hair has never been shinier.</li>
