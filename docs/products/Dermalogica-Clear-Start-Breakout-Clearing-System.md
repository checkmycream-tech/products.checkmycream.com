### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My son is very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work great for whiteheads though.  </li>
      <li>Smells great too</li>
      <li>this product worked great for my pre-teen.</li>
      <li>All the products are amazing and do not break me out even the lotion!</li>
      <li>My make up seems to look good even after hours of being on the go.</li>
      <li>Smelled good, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>very very pleased.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love and will buy again!</li>
      <li>Nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>and the product has a nice herbal smell.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m impressed so far.</li>
      <li>It smells very fresh and good too.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>which I never have been able to do before.</li>
      <li>This was one of many products we have tried.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.....</li>
      <li>Proactive works better</li>
      <li>I can even go make up free...</li>
      <li>At first, I was incredibly pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>For her it is probably good to use with the Dermalogica Oil Free Moisturizer or to use only when she has breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>be fair, I have tried Proactiv, Neutrogena, Acnefree, Clearasil, prescription topical antibiotics, and all sorts of over the shelf products to no avail.</li>
      <li>I ordered this 2 days ago, very fast shipping!</li>
      <li>It was cleaner and fresh.</li>
      <li>it could just continue to work as it did for me at first</li>
      <li>and I thought they disappeared pretty fast.</li>
      <li>From the very first time she used it I noticed a marked difference in her skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Probably a great kit for typical acne prone teenage skin.</li>
      <li>It gives you step by step directions for all the treatments in it which is very helpful.</li>
      <li>Skin finally clear!!!</li>
      <li>I even had to ordered the full size product and now this line is in my daily face care routine !</li>
      <li>Her skin was vibrant and supple  not taut like the out products she had used before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really use each of the item in the kit or followed the instructions religiously since I only wanted to buy to clear the blackheads and more for hubby.  </li>
      <li>I have combination skin oily t zone and normal everywhere else.</li>
      <li>It took about 2 to 3 weeks to clear me up but it worked!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ever try a product for my face and does what it made for in a short time !</li>
      <li>Helps at first but then actually made my face break out.</li>
      <li>I was totally surprised by this product!</li>
      <li>I was expecting this to be smaller according to most reviews, but this kit is plenty enough for about a month&#x27;s worth of use if you use small amounts.</li>
      <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since my freshman year</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t clear up my skin, but it makes me feel refreshed?</li>
      <li>I bought this product for my 17 year old daughter who was having a lot of breakouts.</li>
      <li>My son (11 yrs old)  is using this as an intro to learning how to take care of his skin.  </li>
      <li>I bought this kit for my 13 year old daughter because I like Dermalogica products.</li>
      <li>My 13 year old son had been struggling with mild-moderate acne on his face and nothing seemed to help.  </li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
      <li>I think overall it is good, but it will dry out your skin (another reason why I didn&#x27;t use it everyday), so you really need to put more lotion than just use what came with the kit (at least for my dry skin).  </li>
      <li>was clear ( no new breakout) and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nothing spectacular. Average to me. Helps at first but then actually made my face break out. I have oily skin and this did not help me.</li>
    <li> My 10 year-old has been breaking out with an occasional pimple for a couple years already, but recently her breakouts have turned into full-on acne. It&#x27;s only been a week, but her face has cleared up dramatically! She was initially hesitant because of all the steps, but it&#x27;s become routine now.</li>
    <li> Ordered this kit for my younger sister who&#x27;s going through a bit of acne at the age of 13. I ordered this 2 days ago, very fast shipping! Everything got here in one piece, nothing broken nor faulty. I was expecting this to be smaller according to most reviews, but this kit is plenty enough for about a month&#x27;s worth of use if you use small amounts. It smells very fresh and good too. It also came with a sample of their cooling masque as well! I will update after a few weeks of use but I&#x27;m impressed so far. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my 13 year old daughter because I like Dermalogica products. Her skin is not oily but she does get a few breakouts here and there.  After a few days of regular use she found that the products were too drying for her skin.  For her it is probably good to use with the Dermalogica Oil Free Moisturizer or to use only when she has breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably a great kit for typical acne prone teenage skin.</li>
    <li> The package was pretty late but the product made up for it. I saw results within just one use. It gives you step by step directions for all the treatments in it which is very helpful. I would definitely recommend this to people who have had trouble clearing up their acne because it definitely works!</li>
    <li> I know everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently to different products, but for the price it&#x27;s not worth the risk. Smelled good, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re faithful at using it as directed it will work! It took about 2 to 3 weeks to clear me up but it worked! I&#x27;m in love and will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever try a product for my face and does what it made for in a short time ! I even had to ordered the full size product and now this line is in my daily face care routine ! I love it</li>
    <li> My son (11 yrs old)  is using this as an intro to learning how to take care of his skin.  So far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 17 year old daughter who was having a lot of breakouts. From the very first time she used it I noticed a marked difference in her skin. It was cleaner and fresh. Her skin was vibrant and supple  not taut like the out products she had used before.&lt;br /&gt;There is one drawback; the price. The product is a bit pricey and the starter, has the basic required products however they are very small and may only last a month of continued usage.</li>
    <li> This was one of many products we have tried.  My 13 year old son had been struggling with mild-moderate acne on his face and nothing seemed to help.  This system DID!  We will continue to use this through the next few years!</li>
    <li> My son is very happy with this product. His acne is clearing without any of the redness and over-exfoliation caused by drug store and prescription products he has used in the past.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t clear up my skin, but it makes me feel refreshed? Proactive works better</li>
    <li> I took a chance and bought this kit. I have tried everything and always had breakouts no matter what the product promised. I don&#x27;t have crazy breakouts but always a pimple on my face no matter what. I was totally surprised by this product! First day and the two pimples I had were noticeably small the next morning and three days in I was clear ( no new breakout) and the pimples I had were flat and almost gone . the system is totally work a try. I have combination skin oily t zone and normal everywhere else. My make up seems to look good even after hours of being on the go. I love this stuff.....I feel like I finally have the skin I always wanted....I can even go make up free...which I never have been able to do before. All the products are amazing and do not break me out even the lotion! I say try it and hopefully it will work for you too</li>
    <li> I bought it based on Candace Johnson&#x27;s (the makeup artist from Youtube) recommendation.  I didn&#x27;t really use each of the item in the kit or followed the instructions religiously since I only wanted to buy to clear the blackheads and more for hubby.  I believe it works.  I think it also reduces the pores as well. Hubby did have lots of breakouts, but after a while it stopped.  He doesn&#x27;t really see a change with his skin, but again he has some crazy sensitive skin.  I think overall it is good, but it will dry out your skin (another reason why I didn&#x27;t use it everyday), so you really need to put more lotion than just use what came with the kit (at least for my dry skin).  It doesn&#x27;t work great for whiteheads though.  I used on a couple pimples and I thought they disappeared pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my face in just 3 days!!!!</li>
    <li> Skin finally clear!!! Smells great too</li>
    <li> this product worked great for my pre-teen. it cleared her skin without over drying it. and the product has a nice herbal smell. very very pleased.</li>
    <li> At first, I was incredibly pleased with this product. I have moderate to heavy moderate acne, and after the first few days I had no new pimples! But, it was not meant to be. By week 3 I was breaking out just as bad as I had been before this product (I was using a Neutrogena then).&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I have tried Proactiv, Neutrogena, Acnefree, Clearasil, prescription topical antibiotics, and all sorts of over the shelf products to no avail. The only thing that has ever seemed to work is a birth control pill, so maybe it would work for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;If it could just continue to work as it did for me at first I would give it 5 stars; I have been using it for about 7 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;Another somewhat annoying thing is that the pieces are small, and there are many. I lose them on my counter a lot.</li>
    <li> After feeling like I have tried everything throughout my entire high school years, I finally found a system that works and isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin! My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since my freshman year and I finally have a solution after 3 years!</li>
