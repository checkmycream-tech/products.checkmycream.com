<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A great product with a reasonable price! Home run!</li>
    <li> It is on time and it is a good product.  it is very useful product and help me a lot.</li>
    <li> I just bought it several days ago. And I found this is very different from the real one. The mask does not contain enough moister liquid, but feel very dry and can&#x27;t be attached on my face. Most of moister liquid is left in the bag and feels like just water, not sticky at all. It feels very different from the real one. Also, the cover of the product is different from real one. It doesn&#x27;t have the label on the upper-left corner. The texture of the box also feels very different from the real one. I can&#x27;t believe the amazon allows fake products to be sold !!!!! I want to get my money return !!! Don&#x27;t fall into this trap, guys!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just got this item in the mail from amazon. I bought the masks black pearl, aloe, and hyluronic. I have only opened the aloe mask but with careful research online, i have discovered that this is a fake. BEWARE when you buy masks online, i havent opened the others yet but the aloe one is definitely a fake. The the ingredients on the back should all be in capslock and also the shape of the nose differs in the real and fake. The real one has a more rectangular shape nose whereas the fake one has a more nose type shape.</li>
    <li> My Beauty Diary masks are famous for being inexpensive, mild, and moisturizing. They also smell wonderful. I like Aloe the best because it smells soothing and feels very fresh on my skin. I have average skin and Aloe helps calm down occasional breakouts. I usually use one at night and I can still feel the essence on my face in the morning. It also gives a bonus brightening effect - albeit temporary. Highly recommended if you are looking for a moisturizing \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; mask for relatively young, normal skin, but I doubt it will remove lines or cure specific problems. It is cheaper if you buy in Asia but for under $1.50 a piece it is still a great value. Happy masking.</li>
    <li> I chose this brand since my friends told me this company focuses on facial masks. It is great. I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mask because it&#x27;s soothing, extremely moisturizing, and has no perfumes or fragrances that can be found in many of the other MBD masks. I have very dry, very sensitive skin and after using this mask my skin feels soft, supple, and refreshed. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This sheet mask lived up to its promise of delivering serious moisture to my face and neck!  The mask is easy to apply, stays on my face with no struggle even sitting completely upright and removes cleanly.  I make a point to cleanse and exfoliate my face and neck immediately before applying my sheet masks, and I find that makes a big difference in terms of how well the serum absorbs.  After leaving the mask on my face for 25-45 minutes, my skin is so smooth and hydrated.  For my face, which likes to flake, peel, chap, get red and, worst of all, break out when I use some products, these masks are a miracle.  I haven&#x27;t experienced a single adverse reaction, just bright skin.  I&#x27;ve almost gone through my whole box, so I&#x27;m ordering more of the Aloe and a few other varieties of My Beauty Diary masks to try!</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second box.</li>
    <li> This mask tightened all the pores on my face, smoothed my skin and brightened. After one use makes your skin look great.</li>
    <li> I consider myself normal/dry skin.. it makes my skin even drier. If you have normal or oil skin, this Aloe mask will probably be good for you.</li>
    <li> After I use this mask, I can feel my skin brighter and smoother. Anyway, I still will purchase this product next time.</li>
    <li> It was a nice product for its price. After left the used mask over night, it was still moisture. However, I still like the red wine mask better.</li>
    <li> I bought this box and forgot about it, so it sat on my bathroom shelf for over a year, unitl this past summer, when I had some really bad sun burns (my face seemed to develop a sudden allergic reaction to sunlight, despite heavy use of sunscreen). I was looking for something with aloe to put on my face, when I saw this box. I tried it out and left it on for 30 minutes. It left my skin feeling really soft and hydratded and, best of all, soothed and no longer red. I even convinced my husband to try it on, since the mask looks kind of funny and it&#x27;s better to mutually tease each other than being the sole one wearing a weird face, right? He was game and liked the effect on his skin too.</li>
    <li> it is ok and it works</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m using I&#x27;ve noticed big changes in my face, pimples have been slowly drying up, the skin is more soft and rejuvenated. You have to follow the instructions exactly as stated in the product and you will see results soon.</li>
    <li> i order sunday april 22 and received my package today thursday april 26 fast shipment. i only need to try my beauty diary mask and see some result thank you CP COSMETIC I&#x27;ll update you guys if i will like the aloe and black pearl that i ordered. the seller is nice and highly recommended 5star for you CP COSMETIC&lt;3</li>
    <li> In one sentence this is ideal for sensitive and dry skin. I polished my face by mild scrubbing and tonning and then used this mask and in less then an hour while sitting at home and spending no 100$ i got salon treatment at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this mask 1-2 times/week</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a Korean store. It&#x27;s a little more expensive there comparing on here. The instruction says that you put the mask for about 20-30 minutes. However, I put it on and left it throughout the night. In the morning, my skin looks sooooo much better (very moisturized and smooth skin, reduce pore size... etc.. ). By the way I store it in the fridge, so it gives me a little chilly kind of touch when I take it out and use it. It makes your pores seems smaller after you take the mask off, but it&#x27;s only temporary. I&#x27;ve used up the whole box and already bought a new one. I think, if you want to maintain your skin in a good condition, you should use this every day (or night) :)</li>
    <li> Great for soothing the skin. I love aloe. When my skin feels like it&#x27;s breaking out, I slap one of these on and it feels so nice and cool. I keep mine in the fridge so it&#x27;s extra cold. I throw it on after a shower and then lay in bed and read/watch TV till I fall asleep. It says to keep it on for 20 mins but I want more bang for the buck so I leave it on until it dries. The next morning, my skin is noticeable softer and glow-y. Definitely takes the dullness out of the skin and also soothes any redness/acne.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s suit my skin!My face became more smooth.</li>
    <li> This mask is one of my favorites from my beauty diary. It moisturizes extremely well and the aloe calms your skin as well. After using it I always feel refreshed and my skin is glowing.</li>
    <li> When I bought it, I bought it for about $12 so it was a good price. It leaves you feeling very clean afterwards and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all! Though, I might say its effects may very because my mother used it too and said it left her skin feeling dry afterwards. I used it and I was fine. Which is weird because my mother and I have the same skin type. 0.0 Anyway, good luck! :)</li>
    <li> After using this production, my face feels much better than before. Many skin problems have been controlled. I will buy it agagin.</li>
    <li> These My Beauty Diary Masks in aloe are cool, relaxing, and easy to use.  They come in individual packets and convenient the aloe is on a mask-shaped fabric surface.  Simple to apply and to remove.</li>
    <li> I used my beauty diary mask for a long time, but it was the first time I bought from amazon. there were so many choices,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like it more if they could be mixed and bought.</li>
    <li> Nothing much, you will know when you use it...&lt;br /&gt;This one is one of my favorite of all time. haha</li>
    <li> This mask is different from what I&#x27;ve before. The mask should be thicker, and the serum should be denser. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s My Beauty Diary Mask, although the package is the same.</li>
    <li> my skin feels great after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday after shower. It is more effective than putting on lotion. Of course, it would not hurt to put some extra light lotion on after masking your face</li>
    <li> It is very comfortable. Great product</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. I have been using for almost a month. I have oil skin, it leaves moisture after using it. I give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Always take a long time to receive it, but these are works fine and price is good. We Can do more business with.</li>
    <li> Different from the picture. and it does not feel as good as what I used before. Might be fake.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to start using masks for a while and i stumbled upon these. I must say these masks are fabulous; they smell delicious and feel so nice and fresh when you apply them. They make my skin super soft and hydrated and i have noticed that they have helped my overall complexion, my skin looks more even now.</li>
    <li> I tried it several times just to be sure. I got a lot of blackheads and awful acne breakout from this mask. I leave it on for about 15 minutes and wash it off.</li>
    <li> love it, so convenient, no messy eggwhite anymore. soft, good for busy professioanl women.Put it on the night before, get it off in the morning.</li>
    <li> really perfect. I use it for a week and it really works.This is what I want. I have to say it&#x27;s really nice</li>
    <li> it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it help me good&lt;br /&gt;i like it ,&lt;br /&gt;it look not bad.&lt;br /&gt;~~~ ~ ~ ~</li>
    <li> It was just an OK mask...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is nice but it does not give my skin find amount of&lt;br /&gt;moisture and great effect.</li>
    <li> This mask is everything I want and need. It whitens my skin, because I have a couple of dark spots. It also soothes my face from redness and has a cooling sensation. It also hydrates my face, which I love. I tried other masks and this si by far the best I will always keep this mask in stock in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> love the material&lt;br /&gt;it is very good for your skin&lt;br /&gt;i bet every one would like this kind of stuff hahaha</li>
    <li> I have tried several types of mask from this brand and so far I feel it is very good under this price. I will keep using it and it is quite affording to use it twice a week or more.</li>
    <li> I have a variety pack of My Beauty Diary Masks.  I tried the Aloe last night and woke up with amazingly soft skin.  I left it on for 45 min then rubbed the remaining serum into my face.  I applied eye cream and no other facial cream.  I highly recommend this mask for dry and aging skin!</li>
    <li> It is a really good product. After using it, my skin turned shinning and soft~~Really love it so much~~I will purchase it again</li>
    <li> When I get a huge pimple and mess with it or try to pop it, the next day it usually swells up really bad and turns a really dark purple. I got a big pimple one morning and I tried to pop it, it swelled up a bit and that same night I used one to see if it would help and the next day it didn&#x27;t swell up at all and it was just a light reddish color.&lt;br /&gt;It took me about a month to use up the whole box and the results were pretty good in my opinion, it didn&#x27;t completely get rid of the pimple scarring/discoloration but it helped to lighten them up a lot and the parts of my face that didn&#x27;t have a lot of scarring before cleared up and were completely smooth. It also lighten up my complexion a bit but not too much and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have would be that the space between the nose and upper lip on the sheet is a bit too big, I have to fold it up for it not to cover my lip, but I guess that varies with everyone&#x27;s facial structure. Other than that I loved the product and results. I&#x27;m already ordering a second box along with a different sheet mask from the same line. :)</li>
    <li> Because it  work great&lt;br /&gt;If it work I will like it&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends and my family</li>
    <li> huuuuge fan of &amp;#34;my beauty diary&amp;#34; masks. The Aloe feels great in particular! Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I like it ! Just a little expensive on Amazon !</li>
    <li> i m an asian girl and this looks like an asian product.&lt;br /&gt;but the mask barely covers my nostril.&lt;br /&gt;i bet if you have a taller nose than me, then this product wont cover your nose area.&lt;br /&gt;however, mask itself was not bad.&lt;br /&gt;cools the skin and moisture the skin.&lt;br /&gt;i really didn&#x27;t see much difference other than cooling/ moisture effect after 3 use.</li>
    <li> Actually I always use it before. I bought it in other countries, but it looks like the same one that I used before.</li>
    <li> I love how this had a shrink wrapped covering on the box when it arrived to assure that it is new. It is really written in Japanese!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the aloe mask. I use it before going to bed. And my skin gets smooth after a whole night sleep. 2 masks per week helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and moisturizing mask. Nice gentle smell. A lot of serum in it. I would give it a 5 star if the nose part isn&#x27;t too short.</li>
    <li> Reviews were helpful. The product instructions were not in English, but the mask was easy to use. It leaves your skin moist and refreshing after. You can really feel the effects right after your first use. Definitely does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> feels nice when applying on face.</li>
    <li> great product for the price. make my skin soft. Like it a lot</li>
    <li> My Beauty Diary Masks is popular in my friends. We all like it for its easy to use and carry.</li>
    <li> First time buy this kinda product on Amazon, and found out this is actually a Taiwanese brand. Great product, feels good after using it!</li>
    <li> There are definitely better masks, both for when you apply and the result. This mask is a bit on the small size (almost didn&#x27;t cover my whole face), but I don&#x27;t know how it would work on someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But considering the price is a little over a dollar a mask, not bad. The smell is light and nice. If you are willing to fork over more money, I would rec The Face Shop&#x27;s deep moisture mask.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! The price is right for this product and and it&#x27;s super easy to use on your face.</li>
    <li> I will buy it next time.&lt;br /&gt;I feel great next morning. and my acne became much better than before.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have large pore problem near my nose on both sides, after I used this mask, for several minutes the pores seemed to be much smaller than before, of course later they are back to the big looking, it&#x27;s not because of the product, it&#x27;s because of my skin problem. I really hope those extended pores can disappear eventually. Over all, this product is very moisturized, effective, and makes my skin feel comfortable. Definitely will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I loved it so much I kept buying more of these masks. :) (In other types as well such as Res-Q and Natto.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does hydrate and I think it&#x27;s one of the best hydration masks in the whole line!</li>
    <li> Very good, effective, I love this product&#x27;s function, I need this, I use this product everyday, I like it very much</li>
    <li> This mask makes the skin more hydrated and therefore it seems healthier. but like most hydrating sheet masks, the result only last a short time -- maybe an hour or two. It&#x27;s good for a quick treatment before a night out or an event, but do not expect any long term effect such as anti-aging or improving skin tone, etc.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mask. I don&#x60;t remember how many boxes I have used. But I am sure I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Got this very quickly and was very happy with the purchase.  Although, I do tend to break out after using this.</li>
    <li> This prodect is very good, It fit your skin, giving your skin moisture, let your skin to be very smoothness. And this seller is very nice, already bought this product few times from them. And I&#x27;ll Continue doing that.</li>
    <li> I like this mask very much. My skin is oily skin and this is very light and clear when I apply it on my face.</li>
