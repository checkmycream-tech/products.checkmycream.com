<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought these along with the black and red tips. They are really fun and cute to wear. I love the fact that you get such a large quantity for the price. Good deal!</li>
    <li> Very Cute :) I got them for my sister and she love it the pink tips for her b-day was just so cute on her she want more cause she use them all lol</li>
    <li> When I got these I was expecting cute short nails ( like the ones sold at drugstores ) not long,  pointy, ghetto nails. I suppose I can use a nail cutter, However, that is another expense I don&#x27;t want to make. The seller shipped the item right away in neat packages. It is a good price just don&#x27;t expect wearable nail tips. Also, the ends that you are suppose to adhere to your cuticles are pointed and if done wrong, can damage the surrounding skin.</li>
    <li> I like buying from them order came fast . And price was very cheap thank you</li>
    <li> I had a few request for pink tips from my teenage clients! Alot of them don&#x27;t like it painted on and I came across these and felt I had scored big! Oh and I did! They absolutely love them! Took little bit to get them in the mail but, it was well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these tips! They came VERY quick, much sooner than other items I purchased weeks before these. They are just lovely amd the same ones you can find in the salon. I ordered the clear and pink tips. So happy with my purchase &amp;&amp; I completely recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> But they turned out to be pretty good nail tips. I did a full acrylic set on myself with these nail tips and pink acrylic powder. I&#x27;ll attach a picture to show how they turned out. They of course came square shape but I filed mine to almond. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of these nails because they weren&#x27;t cala nails given the fact that times are tough I didn&#x27;t expect the nails to last for more than 5 days boy was I surprised they lasted 3 weeks and I have only been doing the gelish nails gor 1 years I got great compliments from all my coworkers thanks I will be buying these again</li>
    <li> They are very whatever. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> Nice tips, wonderful color. Arrived as stated, in good condition, in individual bags. Happy with tips. Recommend if you want to do your own nails, they&#x27;re easy to use and many sizes to use. Good seller!</li>
    <li> Nice pink color! No complaints at all! Received all my item&#x27;s, but it took about 3 weeks! I recommend to buy! I recommend to buy!</li>
    <li> Nice nail tips!  Doing your own nails saves you a ton of money and these are good quality!  they are thinner where you apply the glue so you don&#x27;t have to file them flat.  Good deal</li>
    <li> I bought these to put on the tips of my nails with acrylic and they were great! They were easy to trim lots of sizes and easy to buff and what not! GREAT FOR THE PRICE! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I Gave It A 5 Star Based On The Product &amp; The Product Alone. Not On Time Or Anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**They come as shown. Same color same size.&lt;br /&gt;** So many different sizes!&lt;br /&gt;**Fits and buffers PERFECTLY!&lt;br /&gt;**So pretty to wear with acrylic.&lt;br /&gt;**Perfect smile line.&lt;br /&gt;****GREAT PRICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I WILL buy again. Only thing the time to get it was long (a month). But for less than $3 bucks its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> very durable nails and the color is very pretty and spot on. these nails are great for every day use!</li>
    <li> I had just bought them a while back but haven&#x27;t had the chance to do them since today, and let me tell you something .. these are it ! they don&#x27;t bend easily, aren&#x27;t flimsy, and they don&#x27;t snap  off if that makes any sense . these are like those nails at a salon . They are professional nail tips and are perfect !!!!! I LOVE THEM ! I had no trouble with these nail tips. Absolutely no problem . best believe I will keep ordering these ! ❤ I love how my nails look! it&#x27;s like I went to the salon and had them done (: the color pink tips fits my needs and especially for the price for them, omg! who wouldn&#x27;t get these!? i love them !! thank you!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look great I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t tried them to see if the stay on or chip off.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good buy for 4$.</li>
    <li> Took about a month to ship, they are okay</li>
    <li> The product was the same color and the same shape as I expected it to be. It was just a little flimsy.</li>
    <li> if youre looing for some fun, low cost tips, these are it! They have a good length because they aren&#x27;t too long like most others but can still give you a fun length if you choose it that way&lt;br /&gt;the delivery was a bit slow but I was in no hurry anyways. I recommend them, especially if you are just starting to do your own nails.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. They don&#x27;t easily break. I&#x27;m wearing them right now and I love the feel. They feel like my own fingernails, they used to be just as strong and pleasant when touching. I will definitely buy more later.</li>
    <li> I purchased these along with the black tips and for the price the quality is pretty decent. 500 tips for 1.00. you cannot beat that. They come in a bunch of different colors i will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Love these what is shown in pictures is what you get the price is reasonable and the pink is a little bit lighter</li>
    <li> Great product, Thank you</li>
    <li> Pretty in pink.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I am so happy i bought these nails! They aren&#x27;t cheap looking, even though they were cheap! I think Im in love with amazon now. They have the best items with great deals!</li>
    <li> I am so very pleased with these tips. They are a little darker pink than what i expected but that pleased me very much! I couldn&#x27;t pass these up especially for the price!</li>
    <li> To lite of pink for me.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails, acrylics or gels and these tips were just what I was looking for. Easy to buff the smile line and blend in.</li>
    <li> Got them early by 3weeks. Really cute</li>
    <li> Cute , nice and a Lil thin.</li>
    <li> they adheire very well without filling before:) the are a pretty color and i will order theres again very soon</li>
    <li> These nails came before the expecting day! I still haven&#x27;t tried them because I need to buy the rest of the stuff needed for acrylic nails, other then that they look amazing(: (I&#x27;m a girl not a guy, I use my dads account lol)</li>
    <li> These nails feel a little bit flimsy, but they look great. The pink is a very pretty color. Perfect for tips or full acrylics.</li>
    <li> very nice tips great for acrylic nails at home or for business.they are long but you can cut them glad i spent my money on them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok I didn&#x27;t use them because the edges of it looks to big and not professional looking.but hay you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The color of these nails are a soft pink. They gone on so easy. And I really love the soft look they give my customers. I will order these again and I hope to order Different colors when the time comes. I like the way your company shipped before the date. And I am very excited to deal with you again.

    <li> These are great to wear on their own, or with polish. Glues on very easily. Good variety of different nail sizes too. Took a while to arrive, but well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I got this item before the expected date, and my daughter loves them. I am actually wearing a set right now. They are perfect for people who love active length nails and for people who love longer nails. I use a acrylic nail clipper to cut them off without breaking them.
