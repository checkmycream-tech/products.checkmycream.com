      <li>Perfect for my mid-length color-treated brunette hair.  </li>
      <li>Price is great, too.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>and they are amazing!</li>
      <li>But it may be good for your hair type.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a year, and it works great for fine hair that has a good amount of gray in it.</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>Great smell n hair feels clean.</li>
      <li>Buy Enjoy products and ypur hair will love you!</li>
      <li>ENJOY!</li>
      <li>This shampoo was able to remove a lot of the mineral build up and return my hair to</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>B A CUSTOMER :)</li>
      <li>THANX FOR BEING SO FAST AND GREAT PRODUCT :)</li>
      <li>I also love the hair mask which most salons use for a &amp;#34;deep condition&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I love this sulfate free product!</li>
      <li>Best shampoo, doesn&#x27;t remove your color and good for heavy hair!  </li>
      <li>The shampoo works just fine.  </li>
      <li>and i notice a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo and tried a couple found in retails stores but they did not compare to Enjoy.  </li>
      <li>and when I use the enjoy products I can get away with it because my scalp and hair don&#x27;t become as oily.</li>
      <li>Enjoy is far superior to those products.  </li>
      <li>I was having problems with my head breaking out and enjoy products are the only ones that don&#x27;t do that since they use good ingredients.</li>
      <li>Great for fine color-treated hair because it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or strip the color.</li>
      <li>I have tried several different enjoy shampoos and conditioners and this one with the luxury conditioner is the best.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I would have to purchase this exact formula from a beauty supply store to be able to do a fair comparison, however, I did find it to be rather &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; in consistency than most other shampoos at the same price point</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
      <li>Arrived very fast</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soft, smooth texture.</li>
      <li>This was the first time I tried this shampoo</li>
      <li>Keeps it clean, shiny, and healthy and a little</li>
      <li>The product is very watery like others have noted.  </li>
      <li>Found it much cheaper on amazon than the salon.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH AGAIN</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The real Enjoy shampoo that you purchase at the salon is like the consistency of a thick lotion.  </li>
      <li>When i switched to my old brand shampoo (Pantene), I noticed my hair was not as smooth and the ends looked dry.</li>
      <li>It is better to buy $5 shampoo rather than buying this huge useless shampoo.</li>
      <li>Even now that we are back on city water, I still use only this, as it has made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I use several different enjoy hair products</li>
      <li>I have used this sulfate-free shampoo by Enjoy for a few years now..love the smell</li>
      <li>It gives me a lot of soft shining hair</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have the highlights put in my hair nearly as often.  </li>

<li> and I don&#x27;t have the highlights put in my hair nearly as often.  </li>
<li> Not bad, not good.  </li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say it has been watered down (as others have attested), but, based on the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to know the difference between this shampoo and cheaper products</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t give my hair the same sort of feel that I&#x27;ve gotten from other price-comparable products.</li>
<li> goes a long way!</li>
<li> It does not remove the color from my hair or make it dry.  </li>
<li> but since I&#x27;ve been using that bottle my hair is extremely dry!</li>
<li> I also only wash my hair a few times a week</li>
<li> The other thing that surprised me, and something I had not experienced in years, is that it burns my eyes pretty bad, if even only a tiny bit gets in.</li>
<li> I do not think the cleasne sensor works, cause the product foams like any other type of hair shampoo.  </li>
<li> It was recommended by my stylist after she noticed that my hair was having issues due to our well water.</li>
<li> Not worth the price.</li>
<li> It cleans without weighing it down.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as thick as I expected it to be, so you have to be careful when you get it in your hand, or it all slips out.  </li>
<li> Ordered as a relief for oily scalp...saw little if any improvement.  </li>
<li> Pair it with the Hair Mask from Enjoy, and you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
<li> For my hair type, it is really useless.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed.  </li>

    <li> It is better to buy $5 shampoo rather than buying this huge useless shampoo. I regretted for buying this product. But it may be good for your hair type. For my hair type, it is really useless.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 4 months now and i notice a huge difference. My hair was softer and easier to maintain. When i switched to my old brand shampoo (Pantene), I noticed my hair was not as smooth and the ends looked dry. I went back to using this shampoo. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works just fine.  I do not think the cleasne sensor works, cause the product foams like any other type of hair shampoo.  Not bad, not good.  Just shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this when I go into the salon. Found it much cheaper on amazon than the salon. I recommend this product</li>

    <li> Love! Love! Love! Don&#x27;t forget to buy the pumps and save $$$$</li>
    <li> I have used this sulfate-free shampoo by Enjoy for a few years now..love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t fade my colored hair.</li>
    <li> I love this sulfate free product!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It was recommended by my stylist after she noticed that my hair was having issues due to our well water. This shampoo was able to remove a lot of the mineral build up and return my hair to it&#x27;s soft, smooth texture. Even now that we are back on city water, I still use only this, as it has made a huge difference. Pair it with the Hair Mask from Enjoy, and you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>

    <li> THANX FOR BEING SO FAST AND GREAT PRODUCT :) ...I WILL ALWAYS B A CUSTOMER :) ......THANK U SO MUCH AGAIN</li>
    <li> Ordered this shampoo with Amazon as the seller.  The product is very watery like others have noted.  The real Enjoy shampoo that you purchase at the salon is like the consistency of a thick lotion.  This shampoo was like Suave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this brand and it is amazing.i saw this on Amazon and ordered it but since I&#x27;ve been using that bottle my hair is extremely dry!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for color treated hair. Price is great, too.</li>
