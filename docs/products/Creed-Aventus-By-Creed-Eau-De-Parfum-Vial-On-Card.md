      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>The reasom i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because i feel that for the price i should have gotten more than one vial.</li>

      <li>hands down the best smell ever for a man..</li>

      <li>Real dealstuff right here :)</li>

      <li>but the Creed brand seems to be extremely high quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a expensive cologne but a great one.</li>
      <li>My 9 year old son absolutely loves Creed Aventus.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny that it says, &amp;#34;Sample - not for sale&amp;#34; on the back.</li>
      <li>Love the smell ,its a shame that its so expensive...but at least i can afford this ajajajajaj</li>

    <li> Awesome scent! Also has a great after smell as well...Scent lasts pretty long too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product under the assumption that this was an original product.  It wasn&#x27;t until I ordered this product from the Creed boutique that I noticed that this product was a fake.  The difference was noticeable immediately.  This one was basically pure alcohol while the real one had a more a natural smell.</li>
    <li> I love the cologne but I thought that I was going to recieve two when i only recieved one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this is not the original. It smells alcoholic, almost like that of a female cologne with citrus orange vibe to it. It&#x27;s funny that it says, &amp;#34;Sample - not for sale&amp;#34; on the back.</li>
    <li> Wish i could afford the big bottle. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Quality amazing and rapid service</li>
    <li> it smells pretty good , it seems really natural , i love it &amp;#60; it was one of my best perfumes i have ever used</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Pretty strong. Kind of reminds me of Old Spice though.</li>
    <li> It smelled very nice. Swag Money</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> I smelled it when I opened it up, but it hasn&#x27;t been worn yet.</li>
    <li> excellent quality cologne. does not assault olfactory nerves like most of the designer brands that seem to be petroleum based. the scent is not among those found in nature,i.e., wood, smoke pine, floral, citrus, or musk. it is somewhat neutral in character to my sense. I am continuing to search for a better match. but the Creed brand seems to be extremely high quality.</li>
    <li> It would be so nice is the price will drop, this Parfum it is expensive but the scent is great,</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. But wow is it expensive. Ill have me a bottle one day.</li>
    <li> Now my fav fragrance of all time</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance! out of the ordinary.</li>
    <li> Nice and great travel size!</li>
    <li> This is one of my top 3 colognes to date. It is very expensive compared to my other colognes. Aside from that, it smells masculine and sexy.</li>
    <li> Love the smell ,its a shame that its so expensive...but at least i can afford this ajajajajaj</li>
    <li> Fast shipment.. It smells really great too.thinking about getting the bottle itself</li>
    <li> Not my favorite Creed scent but it is much better than most others out there. All the Creed samples I&#x27;ve tried have been great and this ranks right up at the top of my all time list. Love it.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old son absolutely loves Creed Aventus.  He locks up his vials in a cabinet and only wears it on special occasions.  I will catch him from time to time opening the cabinet door just to get a &amp;#34;whiff&amp;#34; of his Creed Aventus.  He is such a &amp;#34;Little Man&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! So many compliments. Fast shipping; great experience.</li>
    <li> Empty bottles? Crazy.....</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing! I really enjoy oils but I was prompted to try this cologne by a friend, more than glad I did. It truly is one of a kind.</li>
    <li> Thanks for prompt service. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Wish I Could afford the bigger bottle</li>
    <li> Great cologne, will definitely buy again...compliments everywhere I go wearing this one. You cant go wrong buying samples to try this.</li>
    <li> This will make any woman want to take their clothes off!  That&#x27;s all I have to say about it.....</li>
    <li> Amazing cologne!!!,i can&#x27;t wait to wear it out, by far the best i&#x27;ve smelled yet, worth the $$$$. Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> hands down the best smell ever for a man..</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really good enough that i will buy a full bottle of it. The reasom i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because i feel that for the price i should have gotten more than one vial. But other than that i cannot complain.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend LOVES this cologne. And it arrived on time</li>
    <li> Good price and nice fragrance .</li>
    <li> Superfast shipping from seller and product was authentic.</li>
    <li> Great for trying this cologne out before buying a large bottle,  usually high end department stores will hand out sample sizes for free, but where we live it&#x27;s a bit of a drive to try it out. My fiance loves it and it smells amazing.  It&#x27;s a expensive cologne but a great one. So if you are unsure how this cologne will work for you I do suggest trying the product this way! It was a great stocking stuffer this Christmas.</li>
    <li> I am sorry but i did not like it.</li>
