      <li>Because this is semi-permanent, it doesn&#x27;t have that tell-tale peroxide or ammonia smell that many permanent dyes have.</li>

      <li>(: love splat and their products.</li>
      <li>So far I haven&#x27;t experienced any fading.</li>
      <li>As far as packaging goes they did a great job and put plenty of packaging paper in the box it shipped in.</li>
      <li>so i would tell my friends about this wonderful black hair dye. :)</li>
      <li>but overall i am a happy customer :)</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>And the &#x27;odor&#x27; of the dye isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
      <li>This colorant gives the best of any black hair colors I have used.</li>
      <li>Hair was fine after the use.</li>
      <li>She says that is fine with her, but I feel ripped off.</li>
      <li>My hair felt pretty good afterward, too, still nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I also like that this is a cruelty free product</li>
      <li>But as long as you prepare for that then it works great.</li>
      <li>always let the dye sit longer than recommended because I know my own hair, I recommend you follow the instructions if you are new to this though.</li>
      <li>love it so much.</li>
      <li>Splat stayed true to its results and isnt sticky or smelly.</li>
      <li>Full coverage.</li>
      <li>The black is nice, although not as nice as I remember.</li>
      <li>the rest stays perfectly &amp; super shiny.</li>
      <li>And I would spend more money to purchase a better product that does not continue only wash out of your hair.</li>
      <li>Not unpleasant, though.</li>
      <li>If you want a true jet black, you won&#x27;t find a better product and the price is amazing.</li>
      <li>and I wish they would come up with a new design for that to make it more convenient.</li>
      <li>It worked great my hair came out jet black.</li>
      <li>The black faded after a while to a chocolate brown which is great.</li>
      <li>The directions are straight forward and easy to follow.</li>
      <li>and it arrived quickly and was exactly as advertized.</li>
      <li>and it comes right off</li>
      <li>Plus it perfectly matches the jet black extensions I recently got</li>
      <li>if you mix some of Splat&#x27;s &amp;#34;Blue Envy&amp;#34; in it you get the perfect Blue Black.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the PERFECT black, with no blue or gray hues.</li>
      <li>The splat oxide for the bleaching was there, but there was no bleach to mix it with, I almost mixed the dye in with the oxide, luckily I looked at it more closely and didn&#x27;t make that mistake.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I usually use this and it works great...</li>
      <li>It was a little more tricky to pour it safely into the bottle but not impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;d use it again for a single fur project, and will I am sure I&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Always loved the Jet Black from Splat.</li>
      <li>At first it claimed it was delivered</li>
      <li>I used a facial gel to protect my ears, neck and face somewhat and made sure I had dye remover wipes on hand before I began.</li>
      <li>The first time I did it, I used a permanent box dye that I had used before, so I knew it would work well.</li>
      <li>I love that if you leave this in for double the time it will be permanent instead of semi permanent.</li>
      <li>This was the first time dying my hair</li>
      <li>and it never fails me</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely satisfied with this product and the price was very affordable in comparison to shopping at the local store!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hands down best black hair color.</li>
      <li>this works so  good and last long time ..</li>
      <li>Greatest true black on the market for those of us that can&#x27;t use the regular permanent and semi-permanent blacks from other companies.</li>
      <li>would recommend this to anyone who wants a drastic color change or just an updated look.</li>
      <li>I spent more after buying gloves since they weren&#x27;t inside the box.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it could get much darker.</li>
      <li>The kit comes with absolutely everything you need.</li>
      <li>thanks will buy again</li>
      <li>The colors do wash out some during each wash but as a person that changes my hair color a lot, I actually really like that.</li>
      <li>I wanted a black that wasn&#x27;t tinted blue or a natural black with brown tones, and this fit perfectly.  </li>
      <li>The end result was full gray coverage, a true black color, and even tone throughout.</li>
      <li>But the dark brown is still cute</li>
      <li>ok i been dying my hair black for years ..</li>
      <li>Love Splat Jet Black hair dye.</li>
      <li>I love this black</li>
      <li>i am not sure why the walgreens or walmart will not sell this product anymore, but i saw and bought this item on amazon and it worked as usual, perfect!</li>
      <li>This is a really messy product, and stains pretty easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried black feria hair color and about every other black hair box coloring but this is the only one that has no fading (even after 3 months of washing my hair once or twice daily) and does fade to a gray or blue or a purple. Love it! BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Lol. Couldn&#x27;t find this in stores anymore so I bought it online. I used to use it and it was the only black that permanently stayed so I fell in love. I get this thing in the mail, the box is open and was missing the squeeze top to the bottle. Reluctantly, I used the product anyway although this shouldve been warning signs. Mixed the concoction and it was very watery, I don&#x27;t remember the product being like this. It was a real mess without the squeeze top but still got the job done but this time called for a major cleanup. The black is nice, although not as nice as I remember. I give it 3 stars because it still left a nice color in my hair although it was a rocky kand slightly untrustworthy) process.</li>
    <li> I cannot even count the number of products I have tried in my search of a true black hair dye. I finally found it! I was skeptical during application as the product was really runny, but it actually ended up being a good thing, making it easier to ensure full coverage. Just make sure you put petroleum jelly on your ears, forehead, neck, etc. to ensure you don&#x27;t dye your skin and put some old towels on the floor to catch any runoff. The end result was full gray coverage, a true black color, and even tone throughout. While it isn&#x27;t marketed as a permanent color a friend told me to process it for 2x the suggested time and it would be. So far I haven&#x27;t experienced any fading. In fact, this is better than the results I have gotten at the salon. If you want a true jet black, you won&#x27;t find a better product and the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> This hair dye has a very strange BAD SMELL to it.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair color, so this one stood out in a bad way.  I would NOT recommend it.</li>
    <li> I usually use this and it works great... BUT for some reason it came mostly empty this time with the nozzle tip for the bottle and the pair of gloves missing. It&#x27;s like someone took half of the box out. This is the product I normally use so I know how it usually comes. Barely had enough to use.</li>
    <li> Amazing I have been using this for almost 3 years and I love it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, but DO NOT use bleach after having used it. The two react chemically and you&#x27;ll be getting an unintended pixie cut before you can blink.</li>
    <li> Been coloring my hair for many years to cover gray. This colorant gives the best of any black hair colors I have used. Thick and stays put, if you are looking for jet black hair, this is the product for you. I found that other back hair colors are more subtle with brown or red undertones. Splat stayed true to its results and isnt sticky or smelly.</li>
    <li> Color still hasn&#x27;t faded, it&#x27;s been almost 2 months.</li>
    <li> This is a really messy product, and stains pretty easily. But as long as you prepare for that then it works great. Good color. Full coverage. Hard to get off your skin once you get it on there though.</li>
    <li> I love the colour! It&#x27;s super black and left my hair conditioned and shiny!</li>
    <li> This is the only at-home hair dye that actually makes my hair completely black. A little messy but not enough to knock it down a star.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite hair color. love it so much. i like to keep my signature black hair looking hot with this brand. and it never fails me (: love splat and their products.</li>
    <li> Produced a great jet black color, but was messy and very runny. Hard to apply without making a mess.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. True black color. My teen really loves it. No foul smell like others.</li>
    <li> The dye is really good, the strongest one I used. Hair was fine after the use. It is so good, the blonder will not take it off. I used this dye once a year ago,and blonder would not work only on the 2 inch line in the middle of my head all the way around. I would recommend to use one type of the dye consistently, and especially for this brand.</li>
    <li> ok i been dying my hair black for years .. this works so  good and last long time .. i have not had to dye my hair for almost 2 months now and my hair is still jet black ..</li>
    <li> Nice color. Great one step product. Leaves hair feeling softer and less damaged.</li>
    <li> Used it to cover up bleached areas and darken my natural black color and this has lasted for over a month with no noticeable fading!!!</li>
    <li> After using this my hair was BLACK and I mean BLACK! Its been 6 weeks and it hasn&#x27;t faded. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> i would not hesitate to use this product, what ever color you need it will be! i will always order from them. i even got two red same brand.  love it</li>
    <li> I wanted a black that wasn&#x27;t tinted blue or a natural black with brown tones, and this fit perfectly.  It is semi permanent which is the only complaint I have, dye tends not to last long in my hair even using a color safe shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of all splat semi-permanent colors so far. I haven&#x27;t tried their temporary washable colors yet. I just recently purchased the Jet Black from Amazon and I&#x27;ll admit I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t spread far enough to do all of my hair since my hair is about waist length, but it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to pouring a powder packet into the bottle and this was a little different because it was a cream packet instead. It was a little more tricky to pour it safely into the bottle but not impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve used splat before I was careful to cover all surfaces with newspaper or plastic before starting, I also covered my forearms with plastic to avoid staining my arms as I&#x27;ve done in the past. I used a facial gel to protect my ears, neck and face somewhat and made sure I had dye remover wipes on hand before I began. Splat will stain everything! if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had faded red streaks in my hair (also from splat) before using this and at first it didn&#x27;t look like it was taking, but by the time I was done coating my hair it was obvious that I would get full on black coverage all over. There was enough for all of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always let the dye sit longer than recommended because I know my own hair, I recommend you follow the instructions if you are new to this though. Then I washed my hair out (with gloves on) until the water ran clear, as instructed. I then conditioned my hair and rinsed again, I was shocked that when I towel dried my hair it didn&#x27;t stain the towel. All the other colors I&#x27;ve used from splat have, but still I would use an old towel just in case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is fantastic, it is indeed Jet Black. Plus it perfectly matches the jet black extensions I recently got so I was able to have super long dark hair after only a couple of hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely satisfied with this product and the price was very affordable in comparison to shopping at the local store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants a drastic color change or just an updated look. Great for streaks, or all over color.his to anyone who wants a drastic color change or just an updated look. Great for streaks, or all over color.</li>
    <li> One of the dye was seeping out of the silver pack when I opened the box. It wasted one of my applications I purchased.</li>
    <li> I have very thick anc coarse hair that is resistant to color. This is the only color I&#x27;ve found that actually STAYS in my hair. Bonus points that it&#x27;s that jet black color I also can&#x27;t seem to find anywhere else. The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like about it (and the reason I only gave it 4 stars in lieu of 5) is that it&#x27;s a bit tedious getting out of the pouch into the bottle and I wish they would come up with a new design for that to make it more convenient. I also like that this is a cruelty free product and it&#x27;s inexpensive. The stores in my area aren&#x27;t carrying this shade in this brand anymore, so I ordered it online and it arrived quickly and was exactly as advertized. Yay for jet black hair!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair dye. My hair is a nice deep black, just the way I wanted it and expected it. For those of you that had trouble, you obviously can&#x27;t read directions. The gloves are attached to the directions that come with the kit. It can be a bit messy, but if the dye gets on your counter or floor, pat it with a napkin and use bleach to get it up and it comes right off (my bathroom is white so maybe that&#x27;s a bonus?) I would definitely buy Splat again when given the opportunity. :D</li>
    <li> I love this black it doesnt turn brown, fade or have red tones in it it&#x27;s pure black &amp; if you mix some of Splat&#x27;s &amp;#34;Blue Envy&amp;#34; in it you get the perfect Blue Black. My hair is AMAZINGLY SOFT after coloring it &amp; only the roots ever need retouched the rest stays perfectly &amp; super shiny.</li>
    <li> THE BOX CAME WET and broken, WITH THE PEROXIDE BOTTLE SPILLED AND EMPTY. THIS PRODUCT was delivered without the proper care</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s black, not black jet -.-</li>
    <li> We ordered the Jet Black hair dye by Splat. At first it claimed it was delivered and we had never received it. The company sent out another box to us.&lt;br /&gt;I just opened it to dye my daughters hair. The splat oxide for the bleaching was there, but there was no bleach to mix it with, I almost mixed the dye in with the oxide, luckily I looked at it more closely and didn&#x27;t make that mistake.&lt;br /&gt;The actual color came in a TINY little foil packet.&lt;br /&gt;My daughters hair barely reaches her shoulders, and it was not enough color for her hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am really disappointed because we used the lavender on her hair before, it came in a huge bottle, already mixed, and we didn&#x27;t use it all, we were able to close it and use it again as her roots grew out.&lt;br /&gt;That was months ago and it is still purple.&lt;br /&gt;She wanted to cover that up with the black. I think she will end up with black roots and purple ends now. She says that is fine with her, but I feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s litterly jet black like it says going to buy it again 💋❤️</li>
    <li> Love Splat Jet Black hair dye. Always works out great. I&#x27;ve experimented with several black hair dyes, but all fall short when it comes to Splat Jet Black, all the others fade quickly or they are not dark enough. Splat never fails and I will continue to buy it every time I dye my hair black!</li>
    <li> The gloves were missing and I payed $12.75 for this oder.&lt;br /&gt;Then I spent more after buying gloves since they weren&#x27;t inside the box.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Hands down best black hair color. I&#x27;ve tried ALL over the counter dyes, &amp; this is by far the blackest.</li>
    <li> its a really great dye but you have to leave it on for more longer then 5 mins then it stay</li>
    <li> Awful product. Super thin and doesn&#x27;t stick to hair. Ran all down my face</li>
    <li> i am not sure why the walgreens or walmart will not sell this product anymore, but i saw and bought this item on amazon and it worked as usual, perfect! my daughter dye&#x27;s her tips of her hair black and needed a retouch, everything worked great, i did need to purchase seperately the bleach but overall i am a happy customer :)</li>
    <li> So ready to use this and have my hair black and not brown in the sun. Shipping was great.</li>
    <li> thanks will buy again</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s the only product that really turns the hair black!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> I have been dyeing my hair black for ages and tried this recently because I am sick and tired of dying it every month due to fading. This product is amazing. It has been almost 3 months and I barely noticed minimal fading. It turns out very shiny and super black. So if you want a more natural black, this is not it.</li>
    <li> I luv this dye but it is 2 watery u make a big mess if not careful u will get it all over the place and yorself but I love it</li>
    <li> Was used to using splat but they were always semi-permanent. Totally my fault that I didn&#x27;t realize this was permanent or, &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; and I didn&#x27;t do an allergy test first so I ended up in the ER with my eyes swollen shut. Please be careful using black dye, ALWAYS do an allergy test!!!!</li>
    <li> Read the instructions so you don&#x27;t burn yourself. Product delivers on its promises.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this hair dye to dye FUR! It looks great!!! It&#x27;s VIVID deep-solid black and it doesn&#x27;t rub off. My only gripe is that if it comes into contact with another color (I dyed the same fur with multiple colors at the same time) it doesn&#x27;t bleed into the color next to it, it dominates the other colors, kind of washing them back from where I wanted them to overlap- by the same company. And the &#x27;odor&#x27; of the dye isn&#x27;t that strong. Overall, I&#x27;d use it again for a single fur project, and will I am sure I&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results. It&#x27;s the PERFECT black, with no blue or gray hues. Just pure BLACK.</li>
    <li> Always loved the Jet Black from Splat. Greatest true black on the market for those of us that can&#x27;t use the regular permanent and semi-permanent blacks from other companies.</li>
    <li> Product is a runny and continues to wash out of your hair. Would not recommend this product. And I would spend more money to purchase a better product that does not continue only wash out of your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the hopes of dying my hair back black. It worked great my hair came out jet black.</li>
    <li> Really great product! Splat kits have have everything you&#x27;ll need in them for what ever color you get. There&#x27;s bleach already in the bright fun colors and the Jet black is a true black and not some weird green or brown color. Even their lightening bleach kits have a ph shampoo and a reconstructing conditioner in them. The only thing this company is missing is a toner :3</li>
    <li> first time coloring my hair black with it, downfall is after awhile your hair starts looking like a faded gun metal object so you have to touch it every now and then with this.&lt;br /&gt;if it was permanent and not semi permanent I would keep going back but splat and any other brand does add up in the end and can get pricy</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dye❤ just don&#x27;t go swimming with it in because then it&#x27;ll turn into a dark brown! But the dark brown is still cute</li>
    <li> I dye my naturally blonde hair black. The first time I did it, I used a permanent box dye that I had used before, so I knew it would work well. However, I wanted to try a slightly less damaging dye that would also last a decent amount of time without fading, so I tried this stuff. The first thing I noticed was the smell. Because this is semi-permanent, it doesn&#x27;t have that tell-tale peroxide or ammonia smell that many permanent dyes have. Rather, this smelled like a slightly stronger, more artificial aloe vera scent. Not unpleasant, though. I was quite pleased with the result after using it on my head. It did very well to cover my dark blonde roots, but also refreshed the previous black color (which had faded to a very dark brown in some areas), bringing it back to a pure jet black. My hair felt pretty good afterward, too, still nice and soft. I&#x27;ll most likely be using this from now on for my roots, provided that the color lasts long enough without lots of fading.</li>
    <li> I love that if you leave this in for double the time it will be permanent instead of semi permanent. I love the color. It works perfectly for the Halloween costume that I a doing this year.</li>
    <li> Splat is a great dye. I have been using it for years. The colors do wash out some during each wash but as a person that changes my hair color a lot, I actually really like that. The black faded after a while to a chocolate brown which is great.</li>
    <li> The kit comes with absolutely everything you need. The directions are straight forward and easy to follow. This was the first time dying my hair and I had no trouble at all. Also for the people who said the gloves weren&#x27;t there you obviously never looked at the directions because they&#x27;re attached to the directions. As far as packaging goes they did a great job and put plenty of packaging paper in the box it shipped in. The color is an absolute jet black and I don&#x27;t think it could get much darker.</li>
    <li> I liked this hair dye alot the only complaint i have is that the dye was very watery but the dye left my hair black as night and thats how i really wanted it so i would tell my friends about this wonderful black hair dye. :)</li>
    <li> Hair color didn&#x27;t stay in my hair like I wanted too</li>
