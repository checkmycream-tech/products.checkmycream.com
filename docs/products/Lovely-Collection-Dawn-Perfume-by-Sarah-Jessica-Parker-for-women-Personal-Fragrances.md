      <li>I absolutely love the smell of this perfume and so does my husband.</li>
      <li>Bought once, fell in love and then could not find again.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely</li>
      <li>LOVE...</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to women who want to smell nice and clean - not over-perfumed.</li>
      <li>It is becoming a favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>I have made this my signature perfume, it is a beautiful, soft scent.</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled to wear it but dissapointed how quickly it wore off.</li>
      <li>Light  and refreshing perfume.</li>
      <li>The scent is a light floral that doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze or give me a headache like most fragrances do.</li>
      <li>I ordered this purfume for my Sister in Law for Christmas and loved it so much that I got my self</li>
      <li>I ran across this scent quite by accident while waiting for my best friend to finish a seemingly endless browsing session at the jewelery counter of Kohl&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>It now has a strong alcohol smell and the scent was weakened as it wears off very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Not too strong.</li>
      <li>It has a very clean fresh smell not over powering like most.</li>
      <li>Pretty bottle, nice price.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely in love with this scent  its light and clean and doesn&#x27;t bother my husband or sissister&#x27;s asthma.</li>
      <li>but because I loved the scent, was hopeful it would become a new staple perfume of mine.</li>
      <li>Very light and fresh.</li>
      <li>So for me to choose this lovely fragrance and stick by it faithfully for this many years, it certainly earns 5 stars in my book.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and not overpowering at all</li>
      <li>I will say this scent is for mid 20&#x27;s and up, try it you might like it because it&#x27;s smell great on me.</li>
      <li>Very fresh smell.</li>
      <li>This scent is very light, crisp &amp; clean - it&#x27;s a shame</li>
      <li>I smelled this at the store and really liked the scent to it, flowery and very soft.</li>
      <li>Fresh, light, clean floral scent that does not overpower or overwhelm the senses.</li>
      <li>Sweet, not cloying.</li>
      <li>The scent is so fresh and clean with a citrus, violet, orchid and a hint of vanilla undertone.</li>
      <li>I love this scent and I will most likely get it again.  </li>
      <li>and I am wondering if its the real thing- plus this bottle seems to have more alchoal in it as its the first thing you smell.</li>
      <li>This scent is amazing and really surprise me, I was not expected to love it so much.</li>
      <li>Great for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>It smells of fresh washed hair.</li>
      <li>so i guess it it worth it.</li>
      <li>My Friend at work uses this perfume and I told My husband about how much I liked it and bought it for me last year for my birthday .</li>
      <li>The scent really smells great but its fading  after an hour or two , it feels like its an imitation cologne .</li>
      <li>My wife loves this fragrance &amp; the price was certainly right.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t think of a better way to describe it, other than it has a bit of a sweet spice smell, among other great scents in it.</li>
      <li>Can be worn even on hot summery days.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>The nicest perfume I&#x27;ve ever had (up there with Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>It seems to me that they hooked people on the product when it first came out</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour on me.</li>
      <li>first sniff\\&quot;.     </li>
      <li>When the bottle ran out I tried to buy more and it wasn&#x27;t to be found in any of my local stores.    </li>
      <li>I have allergies and this perfume is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
      <li>The following day I put it on for work and got so many compliments on it</li>
      <li>In the bottle, this is a lightly floral scent that has subtle, warm musk notes to its&#x27; undertone.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy it and she gets numerous complements .</li>
      <li>I would purchase this again in the future if available.</li>
      <li>I needed to find it and no one had it Thank you so much Amazon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years, and always bought the smaller bottle at Kohls for $30-$40 bucks. A much better price for a much better size!</li>
    <li> This scent is very light, crisp &amp; clean - it&#x27;s a shame it doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour on me. The scent itself was something I&#x27;ve been looking for so I was thrilled to wear it but dissapointed how quickly it wore off.</li>
    <li> So happy. I can&#x27;t get this scent anymore in the states. The bottle I got was even bigger than the one I had. Thank you so much. This scent is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I smelled this at the store and really liked the scent to it, flowery and very soft. So I sprayed some on my wrist to see how it would react with my body&#x27;s chemistry. I carried it with me the entire day and I regret not having it bought it at the store. It was a wonderful smell, not overpowering at all. Would work as a perfume you&#x27;d wear everyday as your own signature scent.</li>
    <li> I ran across this scent quite by accident while waiting for my best friend to finish a seemingly endless browsing session at the jewelery counter of Kohl&#x27;s. I hadn&#x27;t been intending to buy anything at all, but I picked up the sampler randomly and fell in love with it \\&quot;at first sniff\\&quot;.     Scents resonate differently with everyone, but just something about this fragrance made me a little bit happier, somehow. In the bottle, this is a lightly floral scent that has subtle, warm musk notes to its&#x27; undertone. It&#x27;s not at all overpowering and would work very well for day or evening wear. Of course, since body chemistry does differ greatly, your experience may vary, but I used the tester sample at the store about 8 hours ago and the scent is still fresh and noticeable.      Very pleased with this fragrance and I plan to make this my new daily wear perfume.</li>
    <li> I am 16 and i bought this fragrance wanting to try something new and i had never smelled it. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, its just it is something i would see a women in her mid 40s wearing. The bottle and box are very nice, good quality. It smells good, just not for me.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume! I have made this my signature perfume, it is a beautiful, soft scent. I get lots of compliments on it. I used to buy it at Kohls or Sears 1 ounce was $38! I bought this on Amazon... 2.5 ounces for less than I paid for the ounce bottle at the stores! LOVE...LOVE...LOVE  is all I can say :)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and you can&#x27;t find it in the stores for some reason. But this is a soft scented perfume and I love it and get many compliments about it.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend the purchase of this perfume anymore.  When Dawn first hit the store shelves I bought a bottle and LOVED it!  It was a perfect scent for me and it lasted all day.  Many people would ask me the name of the perfume I was wearing and I received many compliments on it.  When the bottle ran out I tried to buy more and it wasn&#x27;t to be found in any of my local stores.    A year later it was back on the market.  The price was cheaper at Amazon and I ordered a bottle.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  It seems to me that they hooked people on the product when it first came out and then they spent this past year trying to find a way to make it cheaper.  It now has a strong alcohol smell and the scent was weakened as it wears off very quickly.  I tried a tester recently in my local store and the same thing happened.  I think they cheapened the perfume and I will not be buying another one.  They fooled me once, but not again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume I get several compliments on it. I needed to find it and no one had it Thank you so much Amazon.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Sarah Jessica Parker dawn perfume. It has a very clean fresh smell not over powering like most. I would recommend this to everyone. People comment when I wear this. Love it</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this scent when I smelled it at the department store.  Very happy with shipper/promptness of order receipt, but the perfume doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.  I layer it with the lotion, but it&#x27;s still gone within a couple hours.  Even my husband says he can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this purfume for my Sister in Law for Christmas and loved it so much that I got my self a bottle- But I ordered hers from a perfume web site and her&#x27;s seems to last all day when I used it - The Bottle I ordered from Ama.dosn&#x27;t seem to last long and I am wondering if its the real thing- plus this bottle seems to have more alchoal in it as its the first thing you smell.Sometimes - cheaper is not allways better...And now I see I can&#x27;t even return or exchange the purfume-Very dissapointed and won&#x27;t order perfume from them agine..</li>
    <li> no sooner did I spray it on, the fragrance was GONE!  I&#x27;ve had perfumes that I put on in the a.m. and after a few hours, I no longer notice the scent, however, others do.  This is not the case with this perfume.  A girlfriend of mine introduced this fragrance to me, which she had been using for years.  She warned me that they&#x27;ve changed something in it because the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last like it used to when she started using it years ago.  Before purchasing, I read reviews that were in agreement with my friends but because I loved the scent, was hopeful it would become a new staple perfume of mine. I&#x27;m especially disappointed since I have a hard time finding fragrances I really enjoy.  Sadly to say, I will not be buying this again unless the quality improves.  Furthermore, my friend has also stopped using it.  It&#x27;s a real shame - such a wonderful fragrance, but poor quality :(</li>
    <li> Light  and refreshing perfume. Not strong and pungent. Can be worn even on hot summery days. This one is a winner!</li>
    <li> Was so happy to find this as the retail store I was buying it from had discontinued sales of it.  The bottle is twice the size for half the price, too.  The scent is a light floral that doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze or give me a headache like most fragrances do.</li>
    <li> Fresh, light, clean floral scent that does not overpower or overwhelm the senses. I have never been a fan of those scents that seem to enter the room before the wearer. I&#x27;ve been a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s LOVELY scent for the last several years, and DAWN since 2009. It&#x27;s simple, reminds me of springtime, it is a scent I&#x27;ve even allowed my young daughter to &amp;#34;walk through&amp;#34; when she&#x27;s dressed up for a special event. I am not a &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; person, I wear clean, simple makeup, moisturizers, wash and condition my curly hair and do not follow up with any additional hair product. So for me to choose this lovely fragrance and stick by it faithfully for this many years, it certainly earns 5 stars in my book.</li>
    <li> Bought once, fell in love and then could not find again.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely loved this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;If i knew it would be discontinued, I would have bought all i could find.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents!  I am always complimented that I smell good.</li>
    <li> Everyone likes this scent on me. It is very soft and dries to a powdery floral finish. This is not a powerhouse fragrance so if you want a hey-here-I-am scent, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this perfume and so does my husband. Everytime i put it on, the smell drives him nuts. And the best part about this perfume is that it lasts all day. This perfume isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. The scent is very elegant and sexy. I&#x27;ll be keeping this perfume for along time.</li>
    <li> My wife has been wearing this fragrance for a few years now and she loves it. I also enjoy it and she gets numerous complements . We just wish we could find it local.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling scent; light and pleasant for every day use!</li>
    <li> Had run out and orderd more!  Great price and I smell good!! I will keep this info to order through them again!</li>
    <li> It is the best smelling perfume ever! Women stop me in stores to ask what I am wearing. It smells of fresh washed hair.</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell. I will stick with Lovely.maybe samples should be offered with prior perfume purchases.nothing else to say</li>
    <li> Very light and fresh. Not too strong.</li>
    <li> loved it and my girlfriend loved it more ! it came on time and was very happy with the product</li>
    <li> I have allergies and this perfume is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.  It is light, subtle, and clean smelling. You can wear it from day to night.</li>
    <li> Get sooooooo many compliments on this perfume</li>
    <li> Love this delicate and fresh scent. Lasts well through the day.  Not overpowering.</li>
    <li> The scent really smells great but its fading  after an hour or two , it feels like its an imitation cologne . Dissatisfied .....,,,,,,,.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume smells clean and great I get compliments. From guys</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry for this item . there is no smells it&#x27;s like a water thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t liked . Sorry</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. My husband usually pays nearly 60.00 for this same size bottle.....I was extremely happy with the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  Kohl&#x27;s used to carry it, then they stopped.  Fortunately I found it on Amazon, and was thrilled.  The scent lasts all day and just smells terrific!  I can&#x27;t think of a better way to describe it, other than it has a bit of a sweet spice smell, among other great scents in it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this brand.</li>
    <li> Sweet, not cloying. a touch complex,  but light. It is becoming a favorite of mine. Pretty bottle, nice price. What else could you want.</li>
    <li> Such a perfectly delicious scent! Subtle but sexy and fresh. Drives my husband crazy when I wear it ;) I hope it stays available for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought 2  bottles of these perfume, one for my daughter&#x27;s teacher and one for myself. This scent is amazing and really surprise me, I was not expected to love it so much. The following day I put it on for work and got so many compliments on it, so I am definately making this one of my favorite scent. The scent is so fresh and clean with a citrus, violet, orchid and a hint of vanilla undertone. The perfume last around 5 hours and then wear off, but the scent changes on your skin throw out the day, so that you could smell the different ingreidents used. I will say this scent is for mid 20&#x27;s and up, try it you might like it because it&#x27;s smell great on me.</li>
    <li> The nicest perfume I&#x27;ve ever had (up there with Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s &amp;#34;Lovely&amp;#34;).  Hope I can get it always.  I ordered it through you because I was unable to get it here in Ottawa, Canada.  I would recommend it to women who want to smell nice and clean - not over-perfumed.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and I will most likely get it again.  It&#x27;s light and not overpowering at all but I just wish it was a little stronger which is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.  Sometimes I can&#x27;t smell it and I feel that it maybe wears off.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it so I suppose even though I can&#x27;t smell it, others can!</li>
    <li> this is personally not my taste in perfume! my friend got it for me. however, i always receive compliments on it! so i guess it it worth it.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is just so different from Lovely What I usually wear but perfectly light. It has a bit of a musk but not overdone. Great for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Very fresh smell. One of my favorites perfumes.  My friends can tell when I wear it. Doesn&#x27;t give you nausea from the smell.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this fragrance &amp; the price was certainly right.  I would purchase this again in the future if available.</li>
    <li> My sister was wearing this perfume one day and I loved it and had to have it! I&#x27;ve been wearing it every since and it is &amp;#34;MY&#x27; fragrance of choice!</li>
    <li> My Friend at work uses this perfume and I told My husband about how much I liked it and bought it for me last year for my birthday . ever since then I  fell in love with it. I recommended to all my friends from california to Nevada..</li>
    <li> Smells very nice, but I find that it disappears very quickly. This is something I find with most drugstore scents, so it doesn&#x27;t surprise, just disappoints a bit.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this scent  its light and clean and doesn&#x27;t bother my husband or sissister&#x27;s asthma. Got it as a gift but will be getting more when its gone.</li>
