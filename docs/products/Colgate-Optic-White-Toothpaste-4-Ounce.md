### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am impressed to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;the product does warn u not to drink or eat anything that can stain your teeth (coffee, tea, cola, etc.)</li>
      <li>The best relief I&#x27;ve had is a decrease to a level of 8 of 10.  </li>
      <li>Even my dentist was impressed when he couldn&#x27;t match a tooth color.</li>
      <li>I am an avid colgate user and will continue to use this product.......LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I was really impressed.  </li>

      <li>Great brand!!</li>
      <li>Perfect wake me up for the morning</li>

      <li>Finally, an effective, convenient tooth whitening solution!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Another note about Sparkling Mint is that it is really a bright mint flavor.  </li>

      <li>Good lord.</li>
      <li>All in all, I think this product is good, but a bit pricey.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted with this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Loved this tooth paste.  </li>
      <li>For a free toothpaste it was very good.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is amazing......</li>
      <li>The sticky ointment kind we used to put on baby butts.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a nice, minty after taste.</li>
      <li>&quot; I smiled :-)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>VERY strong mint taste that I love but</li>
      <li>The toothpaste had a nice consistency and tasted pretty good, too.</li>
      <li>I bought this product hoping to cheaply and effectively whiten my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brand does a good job of cleaning, whitening, and providing fresh breath.</li>
      <li>Being able to ship it to him through Amazon is a life saver.</li>
      <li>customer for many years and will return to CREST when this tube is finished.</li>
      <li>He said it&#x27;s better to use the strips instead.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d fall in love with the results.</li>
      <li>This is my sons favorite brand.</li>
      <li>I so sincerely regret this purchase.  </li>
      <li>I think you can do better on the tub.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll alternate products this time because I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>and bleh i like the feel of this toothpaste more.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice, light mint flavor that is way better than some of the cheaper brands.</li>
      <li>I am definitely one impressed customer!</li>
      <li>I have used Colgate toothpaste for most of my life but this Colgate Optic taste like something you keep under the sink to unclog the drain.  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Most whiting toothpaste causes PAIN and gum problems NOT this one.</li>
      <li>Neither taste amazingly nice however it leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed</li>
      <li>I had to secure all of them with some kind of strong clip to keep them from coming out the bottom.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought it was the ultra bright lighting in the washroom at work, but I noticed again tonight while brushing my teeth before bed.</li>
      <li>I am a toothpaste snob and have always bought the best such as Rembrandt, Mentadent, or Crest 3D because good toothpaste (including a Sonicare toothbrush) is so much better/cheaper than dental work.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved it at first.</li>
      <li>they felt CLEAN!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s just a very strong mint flavour, which is not necessarily a bad thing in my view.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Optic White for about a week now, and I&#x27;m happy to say that YES, GO OUT AND BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!!!  </li>
      <li>a light tingle then full on burning sensation to where it felt like a warm foam was in my mouth.</li>
      <li>I was not expecting much, but after using it, I am so impressed with this that this will become my new toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel very smooth and clean.  </li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s a strong flavor/taste and leaves your mouth feeling really clean.  </li>
      <li>it is really strong...</li>
      <li>like mouthwash strong...</li>
      <li>This is one of the best, low cost whitening products that is out there on the market right now.  </li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite toothpaste!  </li>
      <li>Free is free after all.</li>
      <li>[...] and my newest book is available in stock, in print as well as an EBook, on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Stronger whitening gels, whitening trays and a led light may help.</li>
      <li>have great oral hygiene and only had problems since I started using this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I gave it a try because CVS (a drug store) was having a sale that made it free with coupons.</li>
      <li>It cleaned ok but not as good as Colgate Total.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend just make sure to brush twice a day!</li>
      <li>My gums feel fine after each brushing session, and moreover, my teeth feel squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>but this toothpaste worked first time!!</li>
      <li>So my wife who is a very competent medical researcher (without an MD degree, but brilliant with a drive to uncover the truth, went on line to find HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.  </li>
      <li>Your mouth will feel really sparkling and cool which I kind of like, but some may find the flavor too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but if you need significant lightening you should invest in the product line toothpaste, rinse, &amp; pen.</li>
      <li>and I already have SIGNIFICANTLY whiter teeth.</li>
      <li>I have had great success with crest white strips</li>
      <li>- this was literally the only kind available at the drugstore at that time!</li>
      <li>Colgate Optic White is by far the best results I have gotten from a toothpaste in the whitening category.</li>
      <li>she laughed and said the only thing she had done was use this toothpaste for 4 days.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I figured this out before it did real damage.</li>
      <li>and I drink it almost all day, and when I&#x27;m not, I drink sweet tea.</li>
      <li>but it was too sweet</li>
      <li>I  really have fresh breath, clean teeth and healthy gums.</li>
      <li>Luckily I haven&#x27;t had the sensitivity problem.</li>
      <li>(I was apparently lucky).</li>
      <li>, they look super WHITE!\\</li>
      <li>I am convinced this toothpaste quickly began to erode the enamel on my teeth.  </li>
      <li>I made the mistake of trying it one more time this morning, and sure enough, it heated up in my mouth, making me think of either an allergic reaction or a chemical reaction once the toothpaste hits saliva.  </li>
      <li>and since then I have used many strips and toothpastes with decent results.</li>
      <li>whitened my teeth from the very first day.</li>
      <li>It has a lot of silica in it, so it feels more abrasive than others, but it does the trick (along with some nominal amounts of hydrogen peroxide) to actually whiten my teeth as good or better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most of the benefits come from the dental cleaning and these whitening toothpastes are very minimally effective and a waste of money.</li>
      <li>Anyways, I have had my teeth professionally whitened many years ago</li>
      <li>and I have always had sensitive teeth (top and bottom).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that Colgate has done their homework, but it is too early to tell if the additional silica will result in increased enamel wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you spread it on the teeth and smile for 4 minutes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had been using the toothpaste for about two months and began having an extremely sore thoat and mouth. It hurt so bad that I couldn&#x27;t eat. The doctor could not figure out what was wrong, and suggested that it would maybe go away. After two months I still had the problem, and I finally went on the internet and found out that many others have the same problem from this toothpaste. It does have cancer causing ingredients and peroxide, so I am really worried.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it lightens your teeth by one to two shades, but at what cost?</li>
    <li> My wife thought my teeth could be whiter, so when I ran out of Colgate Advantage...she bought a tube of Optic White.  AND ONE WEEK LATER MY MOUTH FELT LIKE IT WAS BURNED, ALONG WITH MY TUNGUE AND MY GUMS HAVE BECOME EXTREMELY SENSATIVE!  So my wife who is a very competent medical researcher (without an MD degree, but brilliant with a drive to uncover the truth, went on line to find HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.  If you trust GMOs and corn with round up in the seeds, and believe that Wall St care about you or anyone, then use it.  But usually Colgate is not like Monsanto.  My son is an MD and believes, as my wife now does and I do that OPTIC WHITE SHOULD BE CALLED BURN YOUR MOUTH OUT.  my hope is that my mouth will resolve to normal.  if you want to check out if I am objective and concerned for the truth: [...] and my newest book is available in stock, in print as well as an EBook, on Amazon.  What I have experienced was not disclosed as a side effect, so Colgate has liability.</li>
    <li> Most whiting toothpaste causes PAIN and gum problems NOT this one. And it works it says it works in a week I saw a whiter teeth in 2 days no joke, both of us did. I love COLGATE and only use colgate total usually but since this is a new product of theirs I just had to try it. I will NEVER ever use crest WHY use anything for your teeth that has a warning/DISCLAIMER on it saying it causes TEETH staining?! FORGET CREST FOREVER and trust colgate they have never had to put a disclaimer on their product about the possibly of it staining your teeth!</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE! After 3 weeks I have sores and a white coating on my tongue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have great oral hygiene and only had problems since I started using this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to see my dentist and was instructed to stop using this toothpaste ASAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
    <li> I have never found a toothpaste that instantly whitens teeth.. I drink a lot of coffee so it&#x27;s hard for me to make my teeth white but this toothpaste worked first time!! Love this. Yes its a bit expensive but I&#x27;d rather have an expensive one that actually works rather than a cheap one that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have gone through an entire tube of this stuff, I guess a two months ish of use. Luckily I haven&#x27;t had the sensitivity problem. Overall it isn&#x27;t worth it since it didn&#x27;t whiten at all. I have had great success with crest white strips and I think I&#x27;ll go back to that</li>
    <li> I was really worried I was being conned into yet ANOTHER whitening toothpaste when I bought this. But WOW, it really does work. My teeth were visibly whiter after 1 week, and have been getting whiter every day since!</li>
    <li> It took some time to figure out, but one day after using it, I was waking up feeling as if I&#x27;d swallowed a cactus the night before. Each day after got worse. It felt like dehydration, but really that was just chemical burns (it contains peroxide). I spent three days trying to figure out why I felt so ill and what I thought was dehydrated, which drinking an entire bottle of gatorade did not fix so I was freaking out until I read the ingredients and then looked online (I was apparently lucky). Avoid this at all costs. I&#x27;m just glad I figured this out before it did real damage.</li>
    <li> BEST&lt;br /&gt;- taste&lt;br /&gt;- freshness&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t bother your mouth like other whitening products such as strips and pastes&lt;br /&gt;- Shines your teeth reallyyyy fast! Used it for a week and everyone noticed!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product!!! VERY strong mint taste that I love but others may find over powering but other then that I would highly reccomend this to anyone who wants to whitten their teeth cheaply and quickly!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> After using Optic White for a week it has noticeably whitened my teeth. The nicest thing in my opinion is that it whitens the hard to reach area of each tooth evenly. When using strips or gels it&#x27;s difficult to whiten everything this well. The taste is similar to other higher quality pastes, not great but well worth the results.</li>
    <li> I picked up a travel size tube of the Colgate Optic to take on a recent 5 day cruise with my husband. I don&#x27;t buy whitening toothpastes so that certainly wasn&#x27;t my motivation in buying it - this was literally the only kind available at the drugstore at that time! Anyway, we went, we cruised, we ate and drank to our hearts content, and we did our usual brushing routine in the morning and at night.  We&#x27;ve been home for four days now (and have not been using the Optic as we used up our little travel tube) and for the last two days, I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out what the heck looks different when I look in the mirror. I finally clued in tonight - my teeth actually are a little bit whiter! At first I thought it was the ultra bright lighting in the washroom at work, but I noticed again tonight while brushing my teeth before bed. I&#x27;m quite amazed that half a travel size tube used for such a short time has actually made a visible difference!  Now, with that being said, I don&#x27;t think this is something I would use as my permanent toothpaste for two reasons.  One, I have white fillings on my front teeth and I don&#x27;t want to worry about them looking significantly different from the rest of my teeth, and two, my husband and I both felt a very minor bit of tooth sensitivity toward the end of our holiday.  Neither of us has felt that since we got home so I think the toothpaste was probably the cause of that. Given the results I have seen, I would consider using this perhaps every other day and just keep an eye out for any sensitivity down the road.  I am definitely one impressed customer!</li>
    <li> I should start by saying that I began using this product a few days after I used a sample of Crest White Strips. So, I already had a little head-start on whiter teeth.  My teeth aren&#x27;t that yellow, but I smoke and drink tea, so I&#x27;m a little sensitive to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do think this toothpaste works. I can see my teeth getting a little whiter after having used this for a week or so. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the flavor (hence the 4 stars), but it&#x27;s not too much of a turn-off and I&#x27;m getting used to it. My teeth feel very smooth and clean.  I would recommend you try this... maybe do some white strips first, then use it to maintain!</li>
    <li> Well, after using this for 5 weeks I did not see any results from this toothpaste.  It cleaned ok but not as good as Colgate Total.  Hopefully, other peoples results are more favorable than mine.  Too bad, I was hopeful.</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews for this toothpaste and decided I would give it a try instead of paying my dentist for expensive teeth whitening. I also opted for this one over all the other brands because for years, the only brand I use Colgate Total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grabbed 2 tubes, because they were on sale, and have already used 1 whole tube and have started on the second one. I can not detect ONE ounce of difference, neither can my dentist&#x27;s assistant. My teeth are the same color as when I started. I&#x27;d understand it not working if my teeth were extremely discolored but they are only slightly discolored but still very noticeable to me (curse my childhood of drinking teas &amp; cola!!! lol). I even bought the special 360 Optic White toothbrush (which I absolutely LOVE btw) because it was supposed to help with the whitening but still a no go. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good toothpaste, as a toothpaste, but as for whitening, it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s working for other people but it has not worked a lick for me which is a bummer I really had high hopes. I guess I will finish this current tube and go back straight back to my Total.  If your looking to buy it, I would give it a try because even though it didn&#x27;t work for me, it might work for you.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste that claims to whiten teeth that has actually worked, and worked fast. I highly recommend buying it. It&#x27;s so much easier than using the white strips.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Crest 3D white toothpaste for years and recently I tried the Luster Now Sensitive teeth whitening toothpaste.  I was impressed with the Luster Now brand but it is kind of expensive for how little you get in the tube.  The Crest 3D white makes my teeth kind of sensitive, but still works well after using the Crest Professional Effects whitestrips and the mouthwash that goes along with it.  I decided to try the Colgate Optic White because it was on sale and I had a coupon for it.  I was impressed with how fresh and and minty it tasted since a lot of different whitening products have a little bit of a strange taste to it.  My teeth started looking whiter in only a few days after brushing with this once in the morning and once at night before bed.  I am really picky about my teeth and very vain (I admit it) and if they do not look white I freak out!  This stuff is one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive!  Cold things don&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all I was really impressed.  This is one of the best, low cost whitening products that is out there on the market right now.  I would definetly recommend to anyone who wants just a tad whiter teeth, since the results aren&#x27;t that miraculous.</li>
    <li> This is the strongest toothpaste i have ever bought. Good lord. my mouth was on fire and it feel so much cleaner than any other toothpaste i have used.</li>
    <li> I had not seen my work out buddy for about 4 or 5 days because i had fallen ill. when i ran into her after only 5 days, i noticed her teeth were remarkably white, so i asked her where she had gotten her teeth whitened and the amount she paid for the procedure. she laughed and said the only thing she had done was use this toothpaste for 4 days. so i decided to give it a try. now i have had my teeth whitened with zoom in the past, and did not expect to get similar results as my neighbors so quickly as my teeth were pretty caffeine stained, but i decided to give it a try none the less. long story short, 3 days afterwards, i was having lunch with a friend (who has critiqued the dark stain on my teeth just days before), when out of no where he asked \\&quot;Dude, what did you do to your teeth, they look super WHITE!\\&quot; I smiled :-)&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 1 1/2 weeks, and yesterday i compared my pics from before to today, WOOOOOOOW! I haven&#x27;t even finished my first tube and I already have SIGNIFICANTLY whiter teeth. I am impressed to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;the product does warn u not to drink or eat anything that can stain your teeth (coffee, tea, cola, etc.) right after brushing your teeth as staining will occur,. that may be what&#x27;s happening to others who claim it is not working on them.</li>
    <li> Read the small letters&amp;#34;this tooth paste can make your teeth 3 shades whiter AFTER dental cleaning and twice daily use&amp;#34;. Most of the benefits come from the dental cleaning and these whitening toothpastes are very minimally effective and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this product. Seriously, just don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m a normal guy like you. My teeth have never been bad, but they could stand to be a little whiter. I bought this product hoping to cheaply and effectively whiten my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks, my teeth were a little whiter, but I could tell that this product was literally eating away my teeth. Since stopping one month ago, 4 of my teeth have small chips that were a result of the toothpaste making my teeth more brittle. My teeth also ache and my bite alignment is off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble. Go to your dentist and pay for their whitening services. I have a dentist appointment tomorrow and I&#x27;m hopinh like hell that they&#x27;ll fix me up.</li>
    <li> I started using this toothpaste about 3 weeks ago. I loved it at first. It left my teeth looking a bit whiter and my mouth extremely fresh. but after a week I began to experience tooth sensitivity. If any cold beverage or air reached the teeth that became sensitive I felt the most awful pain. I went to the dentist and he told me that the toothpaste is removing my ENAMEL.  He told new to stop using it asap. I stopped imediately and started using Arm &amp; Hammer Sensitive Toothpaste. 3 days after using it,  I began to see a decrease in the tooth sensitivity and now a week after using it, I have no more sensitivity. Now to be clear, my husband also uses it and he has no problems but my dentist specifically told be that this toothpaste and been the cause of a few patient visits to his office. He said it&#x27;s better to use the strips instead. So i woulf stay away from it if i were you. If you still want to try it and you  develop any tooth sensitivity after using, stop using it and change toothpaste immediately. Hope this helps</li>
    <li> After using this toothpaste for three weeks, I developed open sores inside my lip, swollen lips, white mucky yeast inside my lips and a mouth so dry at night that my teeth stuck to the inside of my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Under no circumstances should you risk using this product!</li>
    <li> I am a toothpaste snob and have always bought the best such as Rembrandt, Mentadent, or Crest 3D because good toothpaste (including a Sonicare toothbrush) is so much better/cheaper than dental work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Optic White looks unimpressive as just a plain white paste.  No stripes, twin tubes, sparkles, or any flavor-bursting crystals or strips.  I was not expecting much, but after using it, I am so impressed with this that this will become my new toothpaste.  It has a lot of silica in it, so it feels more abrasive than others, but it does the trick (along with some nominal amounts of hydrogen peroxide) to actually whiten my teeth as good or better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a relatively high amount of fluoride at 0.76%.  This is compared to the Crest 3D at 0.243% (or triple) while the Crest Pro Health lists 0.454%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I&#x27;ve found with a lot of toothpastes such as Crest Pro Health that they contain some kind of ingredient (one of the gingivitis or plaque chemicals) that tends to dissolve my mouth.  With those other toothpastes, I get an annoying slough-off of a layer of mouth skin.  I asked my dentist, and she said it is one of the chemicals and likely an irritant to my gums.  Well, this Colgate Optic White does not have that ingredient yet cleans my teeth really well.  I&#x27;m sure that Colgate has done their homework, but it is too early to tell if the additional silica will result in increased enamel wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note about Sparkling Mint is that it is really a bright mint flavor.  Your mouth will feel really sparkling and cool which I kind of like, but some may find the flavor too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is amazing......I bought it and the corresponding toothbrush and already my teeth look whiter and feel cleaner.....I highly recommend this over the expensive white strips......I am an avid colgate user and will continue to use this product.......LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The first week I used this product I got sores on the side of my tongue and a rough gums sandpaper feeling, all the way out to the sides of my mouth. Finally I went and Googled the symptoms, and will trash the tube NOW!</li>
    <li> So I have been using this product for a little over a week now, and I am brushing twice a day but every other day I have been using crest tooth paste to prevent gingivitis. I am a college student and purchased this product while I was home for a short time. I started using this product on a thursday morning without telling anyone what I had been doing and on Monday when I was leaving to go back to school my mother commented on how white my teeth were looking that was when I told her about this product. I love this product and it actually does what it says it will. I cannot wait to see how my teeth look for when I go home for Thanksgiving break. Now my mom and sister are using this product for 5 dollars it is a must buy!!!!</li>
    <li> I used almost a whole tube of this before the sensitivity kicked in; a quick trip to the dentist for a sealant replacement ended up costing several hundred dollars because the toothpaste is SO ABRASIVE that it damaged several teeth.  They can&#x27;t put very strong peroxide in commercial toothpaste so they put abrasive instead.  I am crushed; the sensitivity was so intense that I had difficulty even getting through the process to fix three teeth.  SHAME ON YOU, COLGATE.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with teeth, white are nice but I am not into scary chicklet white teeth, that is just creepy. Anyways, I have had my teeth professionally whitened many years ago and since then I have used many strips and toothpastes with decent results. Colgate Optic White is by far the best results I have gotten from a toothpaste in the whitening category. It works, to put it simply. I didn&#x27;t notice anything odd about the taste, it has not made my teeth sensitive but it has most defiantly made them brighter. This product is worth giving a shot.</li>
    <li> I used crest 3d white for a while but it was too sweet and bleh i like the feel of this toothpaste more. MY SHINY TEETH AND ME</li>
    <li> I love the toothpaste but am very disappointed in the tube. I have now the second tube that has split at the bottom seam. I  really have fresh breath, clean teeth and healthy gums. I have been using this product for about a year. I think you can do better on the tub.</li>
    <li> I have just started using it, so I don&#x27;t know yet, but it may be what  you say it is, but you need to improved on its container.  The second time I used it I had toothpaste coming out of both ends of the tube.  The bottom popped open.</li>
    <li> This is my sons favorite brand. Being able to ship it to him through Amazon is a life saver. As a busy college student he does not always remember to stock up on things like toothpaste. This brand does a good job of cleaning, whitening, and providing fresh breath.</li>
    <li> I have been trying all sorts of things to whiten my teeth, and this one failed like all of the rest.  Still a good toothpaste though.</li>
    <li> I used Optic White for 2 days, &amp; I&#x27;ve had a week of tooth pain in my upper &amp; lower teeth.  The tissue on my hard palate &amp; gums is raw &amp; sore.  On a level of 1 to 10, I&#x27;m talking a pain level of 15!.  I&#x27;m on narcotic pain meds, which I&#x27;m supplementing with NSAIDS &amp; Orajel around the clock.  The pain never stops.  The best relief I&#x27;ve had is a decrease to a level of 8 of 10.  I&#x27;ve been taking 50 mg of Benadryl so I can get a little sleep at night.  Please, before you use this toothpaste, check the side effects.  I wouldn&#x27;t want&lt;br /&gt;anyone to suffer this way!</li>
    <li> Tastes AND smells like diaper rash ointment.  The sticky ointment kind we used to put on baby butts.  I can&#x27;t believe the odor it left on my Sonicare toothbrush.  Had to throw away the brush, and it was new.  I can&#x27;t believe how awful it tasted.  Threw it away after three uses.  Never had a problem like this, before!</li>
    <li> I used to alternate between this and Crest 3D but for budget reasons I started using cheaper toothpastes and boy did I regret it I realized how yellow my teeth had become so I sacrificed and bought Optic white and the whitening rinse. I noticed a difference in about 3 days then I added other whitening products because I was impatient. Bottom line if you only need a light lift of a shade or so the toothpaste by itself will work but if you need significant lightening you should invest in the product line toothpaste, rinse, &amp; pen. If you&#x27;re impatient add other products to your regimen. Stronger whitening gels, whitening trays and a led light may help. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll alternate products this time because I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It works as a toothpaste, I haven&#x27;t seen significant changes to the colour, maybe slightly. I have also been using their mouthwash. Neither taste amazingly nice however it leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed, it&#x27;s just a very strong mint flavour, which is not necessarily a bad thing in my view. It does sometimes leave a grittiness on the surface of my teeth for a few minutes after but that quickly goes, same with the taste. I would give it a go as there is on harm in trying, I didn&#x27;t find it overly priced. Still not sure if I will buy it again but I will defiantly finish the tub and see if it makes my teeth whiter.</li>
    <li> The other day, I looked in my mirror and noticed that my teeth were getting yellow.  Hmm, I thought to myself, I wonder if there&#x27;s a teeth whitening method that isn&#x27;t as expensive and troublesome to use as white strips?  I&#x27;ve previously used both Crest and Listerine white strips.  While the white strips were effective, they left my gums feeling sensitive and were also troublesome to apply.  Additionally, the feeling of looking like a rabid dog and foaming at the mouth didn&#x27;t bring back happy memories of white strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I happened to pass by an endcap at the supermarket advertising Colgate Optic White.  The claims seemed too good to be true; white strip active ingredients in toothpaste form?!  Results in a week?!  I checked the Amazon reviews online, and sure enough, others claimed success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Optic White for about a week now, and I&#x27;m happy to say that YES, GO OUT AND BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!!!  My teeth are much whiter in just a week of brushing twice a day with Optic White.  My gums feel fine after each brushing session, and moreover, my teeth feel squeaky clean.  There is some excess foaming, but not so much that it can&#x27;t be gargled/rinsed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.  Finally, an effective, convenient tooth whitening solution!  Only downside is that the toothpaste does not contain triclosan, an active agent effective in defeating gingivitis.  So break out that regular Colgate total from time to time.</li>
    <li> I have been using Colgate optic white toothpaste for a little while. I gave it a try because CVS (a drug store) was having a sale that made it free with coupons. I was drawn to it because of the ads on the TV claiming white teeth in a week. I am a tea drinker so my teeth are a bit yellow from it. I will try almost anthing if it is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you spread it on the teeth and smile for 4 minutes (meaning dont touch your lips to your teeth) it not only whitens faster than just brushing but removes more plaque.&lt;br /&gt;It works quite fast. I have never seen results like this before from a whitening toothpaste. Actually I have NEVER seen results at all before from a whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have white fillings on your front teeth, you may notice the fillings lightening faster than the real tooth. This is problematic.&lt;br /&gt;It does not get teeth as clean as other colgate toothpastes and tastes disgusting (like gargling peroxide).&lt;br /&gt;As many have said the price is steep, but I happened to get 2 tubes for free with a recent CVS deal so I cannot really comment on the price. Free is free after all. For a free toothpaste it was very good.</li>
    <li> I brush my teeth four to five times a day because I wear Invisalign braces. After several weeks of using the Colgate Optic White I do not see any difference in the color of my teeth. This toothpaste does leave your mouth feeling fresh, so that is the only positive I can say about this product. It does not whiten as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this toothpaste. Here in Europe it is called &amp;#34;Colgate Max White One Optic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;On the tube it says: &amp;#34;INSTANTLY visible whiter teeth&amp;#34;. It really WAS &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve no idea whether the European version has the same ingredients as the American one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It whitened my teeth from the very first day. After finishing the first tube I bought a second one and STILL have no bad effects as mentioned by some posters with a negative review.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste actually whitens your teeth and freshens your breath!!  I used a professional whitening kit from my dentist but ran out and wanted to finder a cheaper way to whiten my teeth. In just three days (brushing twice a day) I have noticed a great improvement! I love this product and was not a Colgate fan in the past. I am sold, I will continue to use this product!!</li>
    <li> I bought this just because I had a coupon for it and thought I would try it out.  I&#x27;ve never wanted to pay for the strips or any professional whitening, but I&#x27;ve wanted whiter teeth.  Within a few days, I noticed a huge difference.  I&#x27;ve tried most of the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpastes out there, and this is the only one that has actually done anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the taste...it is really strong...like mouthwash strong...but I can deal with that for a few minutes when I know it&#x27;s actually working.</li>
    <li> Do not use. This product will cause mouth sores, swollen lips, receding gums, and myriad other oral/dental problems! Do not use! There are hundreds of complaints on the internet. This is a hazardous product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the optic white toothpaste and whitening pen for just about three weeks now and I have noticed a big difference in whiteness. I even had a couple of family members remark about how much brighter my smile looks now. I cannot use whitening strips because they cause immediate tooth pain when I put them on but this toothpaste and whitening pen combo works very well for me! I will say the pen leaves a little bit of a film but it goes away pretty quickly. I&#x27;d say this is the best whitening toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
    <li> My teeth keep getting whiter. I use this toothpaste twice a day and though my tube is almost gone (about 1 - 2 weeks left), I think they continue to whiten.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite toothpaste!  I had some minor staining from coffee and red wine and this took them away within a few days.  I love that it&#x27;s a strong flavor/taste and leaves your mouth feeling really clean.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months without any issues.  I even gave this toothpaste as a Christmas stocking stuffer last year...!</li>
    <li> Besides the fact that it tastes like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with Windex, it also feels too abrasive.  I&#x27;m glad I only got the travel size.</li>
    <li> I received the entire Colgate Optic White line for free to try from Influenster. I have been using it for about a week, and have to say that I am really impressed. I am a coffee drinker, and by \\&quot;drinker\\&quot;, I mean I can&#x27;t live without my coffee and I drink it almost all day, and when I&#x27;m not, I drink sweet tea. Both of these are horrible for my teeth, and I know it. I have used lesser-quality whitening toothpaste in the past with little to no results. After all, isn&#x27;t almost every toothpaste promising whitening now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened this one with little expectation. After the first use, I was amazed at how fresh my mouth felt. It really does well to clean your teeth, and leave you feeling fresh. It also has a nice, light mint flavor that is way better than some of the cheaper brands. After about a week, I am already seeing some lightening, so it definitely works. I think I am going to be hard-pressed to go back to my old brand now. I really like this one.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product, have brushed my teeth with it once and they already looked whiter! I&#x27;m very curious how they will turn out after a week of using. The toothpaste had a nice consistency and tasted pretty good, too. I would say it&#x27;s a good buy! I gave 4/5 stars because I&#x27;m not sure yet if it&#x27;s going to affect enamel or not. I&#x27;ll be writing another review after I see.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks.  I starting seeing results within 5 days of constantly using it.  All in all, I think this product is good, but a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I bought this product several months ago based on its claim&amp;#34;whiter teeth in one week&amp;#34;. Have used it for at least two months and notice &amp;#34;NO&amp;#34; improvement in the appearance of my teeth. A big disappointment and waste of money. I have been a &amp;#34;crest&amp;#34; customer for many years and will return to CREST when this tube is finished. It was a 5.5 ounce tube.</li>
    <li> Loved this tooth paste.  My family and I saw results after just 6 days of use. The taste is great! Perfect wake me up for the morning</li>
    <li> My husband and I were not happy with our smiles so we decided to purchase and it did wonders for us I highly recommend just make sure to brush twice a day!</li>
    <li> I received a sample from Influenster&#x27;s Sugar and Spice Vox Box and I love it!! Optic White leaves my mouth feeling so clean!! With just a little bit on the toothbrush, my whole mouth gets a refreshing cleaning. It leaves a nice, minty after taste. Great brand!! I haven&#x27;t seen a change in the whiteness of my teeth, but I haven&#x27;t had the time to really notice it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Colgate for years without an issue until I tried this product. There is an odd warming sensation as you brush. Also afterwards a weird film starts to appear within the hour after brushing with this toothpaste. If you&#x27;re prone to canker sores, stay away from this toothpaste! Within a few days a huge canker sore developed along with tooth sensitivity. It became painful to eat/drink while I was using this toothpaste. After I threw it away, the pain subsided and the canker sore is gone. As far as my teeth being whiter, it worked a little but isn&#x27;t worth all the other issues that occurred while using this toothpaste. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like Optic White but the last purchase of four tubes in a carton was a disaster.  Three of the four had open places in the bottom so the toothpaste came out both ends of the tube...I kept hoping the next one would be better but it wasn&#x27;t/ quality control is lacking.</li>
    <li> This was a brilliant product, very effective and whiten my teeth within weeks. Even my dentist was impressed when he couldn&#x27;t match a tooth color. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased a package of three tubes of Colgate Optic White from Sam&#x27;s.  The lot number is:2078MX1124 or 2073MX1124, very hard to read; exp 08 2018 c3 (I think).  All three tubes leaked from the bottom and I mean, really leaked!  I had to secure all of them with some kind of strong clip to keep them from coming out the bottom.  I like the toothpaste but have never had a problem like this before.</li>
    <li> With the first use, I felt the toothpaste immediately become hot in my mouth. Combine that with a horrible chemical taste, and I was spitting it out within seconds.  My fiance then used it and did not have the same heat sensation, but thought it tasted like chlorine.  I made the mistake of trying it one more time this morning, and sure enough, it heated up in my mouth, making me think of either an allergic reaction or a chemical reaction once the toothpaste hits saliva.  I like other Colgate toothpastes I have used in the past, this is the first time this has ever happened.  Will be throwing out this tube.</li>
    <li> It does whiten but about 4 days after using it I noticed the tip of my tongue was inflamed, sore and covered in white bumps. I noticed after searching on the web for a cause that others have had this problem too or worse. I stopped using Optic White and my tongue is getting better-slowly. I am 54 years old and had never had this problem before.</li>
    <li> I too have been using this toothpaste and at first did not notice difference. After a few weeks I realized my teeth were noticably whiter. I will continue to buy this product!!</li>
    <li> I had received Colgate Optic White toothpaste (along with the mouth wash and a toothbrush) to try from Influenster in order to try and review the product. I&#x27;ve been using the products for nearly a month now and I wish I had taken a \\&quot;before\\&quot; photo so I can show you how well these products actually work. After just one brushing, I felt like I&#x27;d just left the dentist from getting my teeth cleaned... they felt CLEAN! Then using the foaming mouth wash... WOW! It was actually a little tingly which I didn&#x27;t love, but it works. Colgate claims these products have the same ingredients as those messy whitening strips that are on the market. I tried strips once and hated them because I could never get them to stay on my teeth. This is a perfect solution! I love Colgate Optic White!</li>
    <li> I only used this product one time and immediately spit it out.  The taste is pure chemical and it burned my mouth like too much red pepper.  I don&#x27;t know if it was a bad batch or not but I decided to take it back to the store where it was purchased to voice a complaint.  Normally I just would have thrown it in the garbage but because it is a new product I thought the store and the manufacturer needed to know.  I would rather use baking soda to brush my teeth than this product.  After reading the other reviews. especially those who used it more than one time. I know that my initial instinct was correct.  I have always used Colgate toothpaste but I will not be tempted to try any of the new products again.  This product was not purchased from Amazon but from a big box store that gladly accepted my return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months and I have always had sensitive teeth (top and bottom). I also am a coffee drinker, but this toothpaste is amazing! I wish I had taken before and after pics, but trust me, it works! Oh...Family Dollar sells this for $3 bucks!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I&#x27;d fall in love with the results. I used it and my entire mouth began burning... a light tingle then full on burning sensation to where it felt like a warm foam was in my mouth. I cannot comment on results because it was too uncomfortable to contunue use.&lt;br /&gt;Can I get a witness! hahaha- anyone else notice the warming sensation?</li>
    <li> I have used Colgate toothpaste for most of my life but this Colgate Optic taste like something you keep under the sink to unclog the drain.  It is horrible.  We bought a double pack after 2 days of trying it I can&#x27;t stand the taste.  I has to be harmful to your teeth, gums, stomach.</li>
    <li> I recently received the optic white toothbrush, toothpaste and mouthwash from influenster for testing purposes. I was shocked that it actually did whiten my teeth. Plus my whole mouth felt clean. The flavor wasnt overpowering either.  I will definitely purchase optic white again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who needs to feel a burn to believe something is working - well this product really feels like it&#x27;s working. Or burning. Either one. I usually use Crest, but may be changing to Colgate after trying this. The burst of mint makes my mouth feel really fresh, but it also still burns a little.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this!  I used it for two weeks and stopped immediately.  My teeth became sensitive (never an issue before), they feel weak and &amp;#34;achy&amp;#34;, and I swear they are MORE yellow than when I started.  I am convinced this toothpaste quickly began to erode the enamel on my teeth.  I am going to speak to my dentist to ask whether I&#x27;ve done permanent damage to my teeth, and frankly, I dread the answer.  I so sincerely regret this purchase.  I have been a life-long &amp;#34;Regular&amp;#34; Colgate Paste user, and I am so sorry for being tempted to try this product.  Now that I have read the other reviews, I am even more convinced that &amp;#34;Optic White&amp;#34; is the cause of the problems I am now experiencing.</li>
    <li> I got this product (and the toothbrush and mouthwash) through the Influenster program and I was highly skeptical that it would actually whiten my teeth. But I followed the regimine and suprisingly they are a bit whiter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only major issue is both the toothpaste and mouthwash taste really bad. As in, the first time I used it I gagged several times. Now I&#x27;ve gotten use to it (I&#x27;m at the end of my tube) but I would probably keep using this if they had different flavorings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and I definitely see a brighter smile. I&#x27;ve been using it with the whitening mouthwash as well. I like that it is also gentle to my sensitive teeth. Don&#x27;t expect professional results, but, if you want a brighter smile over time, it does help.</li>
    <li> While this toothpaste is great, and actually does whiten your teeth, it can have horrible side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried this tooth paste for the first time last night.&lt;br /&gt;Today I woke up with a horrible headache, and there were sores in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst side effect however, is the throbbing pain I have in my lower front teeth.They are also very sensitive to warm and cold things.</li>
