    <li> Love this bag!! Very roomy and perfect for a get away for 2-3 nights worth of clothes and lots of other stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This bag is cute but i would say it will make a great gym bag. After I put my uniform and boots in this bag it is completely fill.</li>
    <li> So so with the grand kids</li>
    <li> This bag is a must have and is perfect for a little getaway.  I use it for the beach to pack 4 beach towels, snacks, and extra change of clothes for me and the kids…I also have used it for a  4 day hotel stay cation.  It is very spacious and would accommodate a 4 day vacation away from home and would fit all essentials you would need.  Only one Limited edition duffle bag from Victoria Secret comes out once a year and is only available while supplies last and each bag is different in style and design every year.  I also have the 2012 edition but this year&#x27;s edition is by far the best one yet!!  It is Cotton Canvas and 19&amp;#34; L x 7.75&amp;#34; W x 14&amp;#34; H.  I love the fact that you can throw it in the wash if it ever needs washing :)  If you plan on purchasing this item, I am certain that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Hell, I can&#x27;t wait to see what victoria secret has in store for their 2015 limited edition bags!</li>

    <li> I gave it as a gift to my daughter and she loved it.  It&#x27; s so roomy, the size is just right for her( she&#x27;s petite) and we both love the design and the material used.  She can&#x27;t wait to go on a trip using the bag so she can show it to her friends. I bet her friends will all be envious of her Victorias Secret  Getaway bag.</li>
    <li> Received on time. Brand new and sealed. More than pleased and satisfied ! And the bag is just stunning !</li>
    <li> Worked out perfectly for my wife while traveling.</li>
    <li> Carried on trans-Atlantic vacation.  Fit flat in my suitcase, travel home as a cross body purse filled with treats from my travels.</li>
    <li> At first I was hesitant to buying this bag because it was online and I&#x27;ve been scammed before (NOT ON AMAZON). However, I took a chance and bought it. I was very satisfied with the price and with how they sent this bag to me two days before I had to use it. I recommend buying with this vender.</li>
    <li> Love this bag! Got one at Victoria&#x27;s Secret for free with purchase, then had to find two more because my mother and mother in law adored it! Use it all the time, only way it could be better is if it had a few more pockets, but you can work around that.</li>
    <li> Love this bag, perfect for weekend getaways.</li>
    <li> VS getaway bag is huge with lots of room for enough clothes for 2-3 days. I bought this bag because I was looking for a huge bag to pack enough essentials for a weekend plus carry my laptop/tablet in. This does the trick perfectly. I also love the fact that the handles are padded and comes with a carry strap. I love the pattern to, it&#x27;s so cool and I have had nothing but compliments on it. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Big bag! Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> The bag looks very nice and it is very ciye and stylish as an weekend bag. However it did take a while to get here a week and 3 days usps. Takes a long time to deliver and orders should only be shipped through ups. However this is just my personal opinion.</li>
