      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Tell me about more of your products.telling all of my friends about them</li>
      <li>It might have worked better if it was an aerosol spray.</li>
      <li>Have used this product for a year and normally love it and could not figure out why it wasn&#x27;t working as well on my hair.</li>
      <li>I love this and use it every  time I shampoo.</li>
      <li>, alligator clamp the top layers for volume</li>
      <li>It works great; just be sure not to apply too much.</li>
      <li>Love all the Bed Head products.</li>
      <li>Aside from the delicious smell ( the only reason I gave it 1 star)</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Awesome product for Short Spikey Hair!  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Product is ok....  </li>
      <li>Love the product and the price...</li>
      <li>I would definatley recommend to those with fine hair.</li>
      <li>The sugar dust (a different product) at the roots works well too, but this product is great for that all-over &amp;#34;tousled&amp;#34; look.</li>
      <li>Added bonus: it smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>I have SUPER fine hair without volume.  </li>
      <li>(they always have some sort of coconut/beach scent), so I appreciate the light, sweet smell of this spray.</li>
      <li>It looks full, it feels full</li>
      <li>best advice for wanting that beach wave look, (after many failed attempts at finding the right product)</li>
      <li>Love this for the beach, apply to dry hair to revive :)</li>
      <li>This stuff is great but buy a spray bottle because its spout doesn&#x27;t work after a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My hair is limp and lifeless on top,  nice wavy ringlets on bottom.  </li>
      <li>Having lots of fun using them.</li>
      <li>This product smells nice (like sugar, obviously) and works well when I want some volume but don&#x27;t have time to tease my hair and use hairspray in the morning.</li>
      <li>Texturizing products like this go a long way to helping fine hair hold a curl too; my hair will not stay curled for more than 30 minutes without them.</li>
      <li>This product is great for thin, fine hair.</li>
      <li>this stuff is great for people with thin, fine hair like myself.</li>
      <li>I have soft fine hair and this did nothing.</li>
      <li>I had issues with the tip clogging, but a little hot water and it was good to go.  </li>
      <li>It made my hair very voluminous !</li>
      <li>i bought my first bottle in a salon.</li>
      <li>use it with my hot curlers to keep the curls.  </li>
      <li>I have bought this product before at a Salon &amp; paid a much higher price.  </li>
      <li>I spray it all over near my roots and then blow-dry lightly after.</li>
      <li>I have pretty long/straight/ kinda thickish , layered hair, and sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to fix it.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and this product really helps me keep volume all day long,</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because of positive reviews.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like salt spray would and gives much more body.</li>
      <li>or I would probably be bald by now considering how much I have lost.</li>
      <li>I had my hair done for a wedding and my stylist used this saying it is great for thin hair when curling.</li>
      <li>This gives my hair so much body</li>
      <li>Tried this first from a salon sale at Regis in New Orleans.</li>
      <li>(I have long, semi-straight, fine hair)</li>
      <li>This hair spray works really well in my fine hair, giving body and texture without weighing it down or making it too crunchy.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with fine hair that wants a little or a lot of body.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and the spritzer is a little different when using it.</li>
      <li>A lot of hair products don&#x27;t live up to their hype, but I found this one to provide the volume and separation I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that always falls flat and had yet to find a product that helped to volumize my hair until I stumbled upon this little gem!</li>
      <li>It sprays in and after I blow dry my hair, my hair looks and feels perfectly soft, but the added volume is very noticeable.</li>
      <li>Finally ran out after a year, now can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>I usually have to use mousse, wrap the top in sponge rollers and air dry</li>
      <li>I bought a small spray bottle that I can clean if it gets clogged.</li>
      <li>Sugar Shock is the only product that has given my hair body and made it manageable; however, you have to be careful not to use too much.  </li>
      <li>The volume lasts, my hair is not dry.  </li>
      <li>I found out quickly that a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Alas, age and stress have taken their toll and I&#x27;m just thankful I started out with so much in the first place</li>
      <li>I have fine hair which is beginning to thin.  </li>
      <li>This adds volume to my fine, thin, wavy hair when sprayed on before blow drying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is great product I got it in a timely maner</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s WAY TOO sticky! It feels horrible like Aqua Net for teasing your 80&#x27;s beehive.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for that &amp;#34;just been to the beach look&amp;#34;, really great for showing off your layered cut.  The shipping, however, left something to be desired. Just stuck in a brown envelope, no padding, and shoved in the mail box where it leaked over the rest of the mail.  I will be purchasing this through another provider.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair product for very fine hair.  This gives your hair a lot of volume and the fragrance reminds me of cotton candy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with this on wet and dry hair. It adds a lot of body and smells tasty, and the scent lasts forever. (I have long, semi-straight, fine hair) It&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;ll purchase it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful purchase. It made my hair very voluminous ! I would definatley recommend to those with fine hair.</li>
    <li> This product smells nice (like sugar, obviously) and works well when I want some volume but don&#x27;t have time to tease my hair and use hairspray in the morning. i give it 4 stars because it is a little stickier than I&#x27;d like it to be, but if you don&#x27;t want it to be sticky then use really sparingly.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well on my straight, boring, fine as a baby&#x27;s, not an oz of curl, an inch of volume, do nothing hair - actually makes it DO something and cooperate with me...YAY!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why Bed Head stopped making this product!  It is amazing for fine hair!!!  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This adds volume to my fine, thin, wavy hair when sprayed on before blow drying. It also gives my waves some definition and body if I spray it on dry hair. I love these salt spray type products but generally find them to smell horrible (they always have some sort of coconut/beach scent), so I appreciate the light, sweet smell of this spray. Texturizing products like this go a long way to helping fine hair hold a curl too; my hair will not stay curled for more than 30 minutes without them.</li>
    <li> This gives my hair so much body it&#x27;s ridiculous. I found out quickly that a little goes a long way. And it smells AWESOME! I highly recommend this for anyone with fine hair that wants a little or a lot of body.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t hold like it advertises. Makes me hair heavy and sticky.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product, since I was so happy with the Bed Head Glaze Haze (MUST HAVE if you straighten your hair)However, the Sugar Shock was NOTHING like I thought. I have pretty long/straight/ kinda thickish , layered hair, and sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to fix it. I&#x27;m always looking to get that one product that gives you the tousled/beach wave look..... this is NOT that product. Aside from the delicious smell ( the only reason I gave it 1 star) this product left my hair very sticky, and I felt like I had bad \\&quot;80&#x27;s gel-curl hair\\&quot;. I was so disappointed. :&#x27;(&lt;br /&gt;it DID create waves, but the stickiness and rough rock hard feel to my hair was NOT appealing!&lt;br /&gt;* The directions say to use on dry hair, but other suggestions say wet or dry. My hair was damp at time of application. I&#x27;ll try doing it on dry hair tomorrow and see what it does for me..*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my best advice for wanting that beach wave look, (after many failed attempts at finding the right product) - stop using a tousled/ body product. Use a dab of frizz serum to keep ends from flaying around, throw damp hair up in a messy clip ( or no clip, whichever tickles your fancy) and let nature dry it. Ta Da! Problem SOLVED!&lt;br /&gt;-FM</li>
    <li> This smells like some kind of grape candy and is great for hair. It smells amazing and the spritzer is a little different when using it. Spray in with wet hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I have very fine hair that always falls flat and had yet to find a product that helped to volumize my hair until I stumbled upon this little gem! It sprays in and after I blow dry my hair, my hair looks and feels perfectly soft, but the added volume is very noticeable. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and could not manage a hairstyle myself until I tried Sugar Shock.  It works great; just be sure not to apply too much.</li>
    <li> This hair spray works really well in my fine hair, giving body and texture without weighing it down or making it too crunchy.  I had issues with the tip clogging, but a little hot water and it was good to go.  And the smell is AMAZING!  I like to spray this in my damp hair before blow drying straight, or in slightly damp/almost dry hair to give wavy textures.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Gives body to my otherwise thinning hair, and it smells delicious. I definitely will be buying it again and again.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time I had thick, thick hair. Alas, age and stress have taken their toll and I&#x27;m just thankful I started out with so much in the first place or I would probably be bald by now considering how much I have lost. This product gives me back my hair. Or the illusion of it anyway. It looks full, it feels full, it is the best thing that has happened to my hair in DECADES. Can&#x27;t bear to be without it. Added bonus: it smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love the product and the price...however, shipping was disappointing that it leaked all in the packaging.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great but buy a spray bottle because its spout doesn&#x27;t work after a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with my hot curlers to keep the curls.  The sugar stops up the spout and so you need to buy&lt;br /&gt;something to pour the product in that will not clog up.  I bought a small spray bottle that I can clean if it gets clogged.</li>
    <li> Product is ok....  Don&#x27;t like the feel of the build up n my hair........ I probably want order it again....</li>
    <li> Awesome product for Short Spikey Hair!  My salon stopped carrying it and I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.... And with a better price as well!</li>
    <li> it does exactly what says it will do !!!! don&#x27;t overuse can dry hair out</li>
    <li> I have fine hair which is beginning to thin.  Sugar Shock is the only product that has given my hair body and made it manageable; however, you have to be careful not to use too much.  I love this and use it every  time I shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have very fine straight hair, and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for creating more volume.</li>
    <li> So sticky! Doesn&#x27;t work and made my hair crunchy and crusty. Don&#x27;t bother with this!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff !!!!!</li>
    <li> I have SUPER fine hair without volume.  I use this on my dry hair before I tease it, and it holds the tease all day.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of positive reviews. Bed Head Candy Fixation is a good product. I have thin, curly hair about mid-back length. I have used the product alone and with Bed Head Foxy Curls. It leaves my curls feeling a bit hard and crinkly. It does not weigh my hair down or leave it greasy or dry looking/feeling. It works well alone and can be used on dry hair or wet hair. I use the spray on my hair after I dry it to enhance my curls, and I also use it on my wet hair. The spray also leaves my hair shiny, which looks great. The spray is not sticky and smells good. A little spray goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product works! A lot of hair products don&#x27;t live up to their hype, but I found this one to provide the volume and separation I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product before at a Salon &amp; paid a much higher price.  I love the texturing benefits and it&#x27;s amazingly palatable smell.  You feel like you&#x27;re in world&#x27;s best smelling candy store!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love all the Bed Head products. Sugar shock is one of my favorites, try it out you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had my hair done for a wedding and my stylist used this saying it is great for thin hair when curling. This doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like salt spray would and gives much more body. Highly recommended for anyone with stick strait hair, also great price!!,</li>
    <li> Life for thin, curly hair! Tried this first from a salon sale at Regis in New Orleans. Finally ran out after a year, now can&#x27;t live without it. Can be a little sticky if you use too much. I apply to wet hair &amp; air dry for added volume. Love this for the beach, apply to dry hair to revive :)</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a year and normally love it and could not figure out why it wasn&#x27;t working as well on my hair. Discovered that the bottle I just purchased through Amazon in December 2014 had expired in July 2014. Was not happy to discover that and now will need to purchase again but not through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this product really helps me keep volume all day long, not sticky feeling is my hair get wet and the smell is amazing</li>
    <li> This product is great for thin, fine hair. I spray it all over near my roots and then blow-dry lightly after. The sugar dust (a different product) at the roots works well too, but this product is great for that all-over &amp;#34;tousled&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  My hair is limp and lifeless on top,  nice wavy ringlets on bottom.  I usually have to use mousse, wrap the top in sponge rollers and air dry (sometime blow dry if I am in a hurry)  to get the curl and volume I get with this.  The volume lasts, my hair is not dry.  I just spray, alligator clamp the top layers for volume let dry.</li>
    <li> Great products. Having lots of fun using them. Tell me about more of your products.telling all of my friends about them</li>
    <li> this stuff is great for people with thin, fine hair like myself. i bought my first bottle in a salon. it&#x27;s cheaper here!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I have very fine hair and it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve come across.  I usually have to wash my hair everyday.  It went two days and still was not sticky and heavy feeling.  I finally have a product that works.</li>
    <li> love it!  makes my hair all poofy!</li>
    <li> Spritzed some of this in my hair after curling it and it kept the shape of the curls and made it perfectly undone.  It looked great!</li>
    <li> I have soft fine hair and this did nothing. It might have worked better if it was an aerosol spray. Too watery.</li>
    <li> Nice product, but it stopped dispensing correctly while there was still a substantial amount of product in the container.  The BedHead customer contact option does not work, so I went to the Tigi website - contacting them is equally difficult.  i did send an email through the Tigi website &amp; never got a response. I&#x27;ve come to the point that i don&#x27;t do business with unresponsive companies, so I&#x27;ll not order the BedHead products again.  Will find another product - there are lots from which to choose.</li>
