<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> its cool but isnt sharp enough, but is still a very sharp blade</li>
    <li> My husband saw this and wanted to get it, so I bought it but had not read the reviews.  This is not an actual working straight razor, it is only for decorative purposes, it does not have a sharp edge, and no amount of sharpening works on it.  But it is very pretty.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to learning to shave with a straight razor, and thought that I may as well go with one that looks awesome as well. While it looks very cool, visuals are not the main reason why I bought it. I later learned that I needed to get a whetstone to sharpen, and change strop a little extra from what I thought was needed. The only thing I&#x27;ve cut is a small nick on my jaw bone, not any beard at all. When I read the description, I was hoping for something that I could use either immediately or fairly soon after it arrived. I guess all this is is a movie prop. So while I should have read through the reviews before ordering this, it remains as just something else I didn&#x27;t need to get and won&#x27;t have any actual use for now.</li>
    <li> it is really nice but i do wish it was sharper i am going to have to sharpen it more</li>
    <li> This razor came in the mail today and it looks just like the one from the movie! It does say \\&quot;Stainless Steel China\\&quot; in fine print on the blade however that is not enough for me to knock it down any stars. It has a good weight to it an is razor sharp. I don&#x27;t think you could shave with it but I&#x27;m sure it would slit someone&#x27;s throat.</li>
    <li> Nice razors after purchasing two for props for Sweeney Todd I bought a bunch more to give to the cast and crew as a thank you for their hard work. Showed up on time.</li>
    <li> Great blade, Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This thing is terrible. Yeah it has a design on the handle...not very well done though. It comes sharp....kinda....but there is no way I am going to spend hours putting an edge on this so I can actually shave with it. Into the trash it goes!</li>
    <li> Great replica, but not a perfect one, like all replicas, none are a perfect match to the actual prop, even when casted from the original, you will see minor difference.  In this case you get a razor that is perfect for shelf collectors, and like other props , this is in no way to be used as an actual razor, keep in mind that props replicas are always made with the purpose of being displayed and not for heavy use.    This will be a great prop replica for collectors, stage shows, cosplay and other fan related projects(fan films and such)    worth the buy and a great value for what you are getting.</li>
    <li> Stupid thing is more a novelty than nothing else, dull and stupid!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas this year and he absolutely loves it.  He said it will take some getting used to, but that&#x27;s OK with him.</li>
    <li> the blade is awesome but wasn&#x27;t shape as previously stated in other reviews.  going to have a friend put an edge on this bad boy.</li>
    <li> Nice replica. not for shaving.</li>
    <li> If you look very closely at the razor and ho,d up to the tv screen when depp pulls it out, look at the extensive detail and design of the blade. Alot of companies have tried to make duplicates of the orginal but have failed to do so. I like this one because of the weight and size. When sharpened correctly it gives a good quality. It&#x27;s a blade for use by a barber not a household customer. I use it on some of my clients here in the shop and I can actually shave quicker. Check out my youtube video where I show how to properly shave with this razor. Type in shaving with sweeny todd razor!</li>
    <li> Bought it to go with my Sweeney Todd costume for Halloween. It was okay for the occasion but I kind of regret spending the money on it..</li>
    <li> Not quite an exact replica of the handle (if you&#x27;re looking for the movie version that is), but it is a VERY nice and VERY sharp razor straight out of the packaging!  Highly recomended for anyone who&#x27;s a fan of blades in general or even still for one who&#x27;s a Sweeney Todd fan!</li>
    <li> If you like Sweeney Todd&#x27;s straight razors, these are the blades for you. These are NOT straight razors. They are replica knives. I bought two, and they are great. SUPER sharp, You CAN shave with it, but you are better off just using a Gillette razor. The description is right to say \\&quot;Huge\\&quot;. Very cool buy</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, I thought this could actually shave someone.  It is so dull I doubt it could cut a carrot!  So now I have to take it to a knife sharpener.</li>
    <li> this is one awesome piece! very cool look, great quality. Nice &amp; heavy! Really glad I bought it, looks nice in the collection!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as part of my costume for Sweeney Todd this year. I thought I would be getting a small, light replica when in reality it was a nice, actual size copy. I must say, I thought the blade would be sharp, but it is rather dull. It has some weight, which to me makes it seem like it could be used to shave if you wanted to. It does seem to get fingerprints on it from the small amount of handling I&#x27;ve done since I&#x27;ve received it. I can&#x27;t wait to use it in my costume though.</li>
    <li> I still am not sure why I bought this, but it works.  And it&#x27;s sharp.  I do enjoy it very much.  It looks like the ones in the movie, except for the word \\&quot;China\\&quot; on the blade.</li>
    <li> This is just a cool novelty knife/ razor. I have found uses for it other than shaving, not sure how that would turn out besides bloody. It is a great conversation piece that is worth the money if you like this sort of thing.</li>
    <li> I like these razors they were the perfect thing to add to the trophy I&#x27;m making for a great barber who cuts my hair. They always make you feel at home so I decided to give a little something back besides a tip.</li>
    <li> I purchased these razors to be used as props in an upcoming production of Sweeney Todd.  They are perfect, and a great value.  The razor has a geat \\&quot;heft\\&quot; to it, all metal construction.</li>
    <li> This is a DECORATION only .  Totally unusable as a Shaving tool. If your State/Country allows you to carry Strait Razors then it makes a fancy Pocket Knife. Heavy metal construction.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good razor, decent edge but not shave worthy or anything. Handle has a minor defect but all in all a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the quality for the price , if i was selling this thing id be asking an easy 30 bucks. The weight is very nice and the razor as a whole is very sturdy and almost sharp enough to shave with .</li>
    <li> More than happy with this...  It&#x27;s a very cool item - I almost wanted it for myself! Lol. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Just got mine and I love it. It&#x27;s shiny and beautiful. Looks a lot like the one in the movie. And whoever said that its not sharp is lying; I ran my finger across the blade in admiration and it cut me. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he&#x27;s been wanting a straight edge shaver and love&#x27;s Sweeney Todd. On the reviews I read this wasn&#x27;t very sharp out of the box and its more of a show piece. When we received it, my husband was playing with it and testing it and it removed some arm hair with ease (even though he doesn&#x27;t shave his arms)!!! I recommend buying the honing leather and cream for use, but this product is definitely worth the buy! Loved it!</li>
    <li> I ordered my package Monday the 26th, and it was supposed to arrive on Wednesday the 28th, but it never did. I looked at track my package and it says it has arrived but I know it never did. It upsets me that this has happened because I was really excited to get this. It looks like a very nice and authentic razor. The problem still remaims though that I have paid for this, and I did not get it!</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality, but it is pretty cool. I used it for a Halloween costume. I actually cut myself playing with it. It&#x27;s nice, but I wish it was shiny like the ones in the movie. still, I like it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realized u would have to sharpen the blade but after being sharpened it worked really good and cuts the hair really good !</li>
    <li> ornate, very keen and beautiful this razor would provide a close shave to anyone and if you should decide to use a few of these beauties as props in a Sweeney Todd play they would greatly enhance the production, for myself , I think I might take up the craft of barbering..... next customer, please.... Oh dear! I may have nicked you!</li>
    <li> Beautiful blade and handle, I am so glad I ordered this. The blade came in sharp enough to even cut hair which is another plus.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the blade that is in the picture. The blade I got is smaller and doesn&#x27;t go all the way to the handle as shown in the picture, making it false advertisment and a huge downer. The tip of the blade is also rounded, not square as shown in the picture. I&#x27;m pretty sure I will be sending this blade back. The only good thing I can think of that came out of this, was that the design on the handle is pretty cool.</li>
    <li> When I bought this I went against my better instincts. This is a very cool item, yes. But if your looking for a straight razor that is capable of shaving, pass by this one. If you really wanted to use this, I&#x27;m sure you could spend hours honing this thing into proper condition.    Having said that, I will admit that this item is very cool! Its far heavier than it looks and looks very similar to the one used in the movie.    So if your looking for a straight edge razor, I would suggest not buying this one. However, if your looking for a cool item for Halloween or something, this would be a great buy.</li>
    <li> Great transaction - items were as advertised. Not ideal for personal grooming, but excellent for stagecraft, which was my purpose. Too sharp for safe use in a stage atmosphere, but easily dulled. Excellent size for the stage, as well.</li>
    <li> very nice, needs to be sharpened</li>
    <li> The razor is totally amazing it is even better than the pic heavy yes big to hold makes u feel powerful .&lt;br /&gt;It wont really shave ur beard i bought the leather sharpener with it and did more than 200 times sharpening but still wont shave but to cut a throat yes!! It will cut it so keep it out or reach of children</li>
    <li> Detail is awesome but the blade is not sharp....I&#x27;ll have to sharpen it myself because right now it it just a bathroom sink decoration</li>
    <li> i would buy it again its fun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; in time ill put alllll the time in to it required to shave</li>
    <li> This thing is sweet and really big. Cut my thumb on it the first day I got it!</li>
    <li> The weight on this is great!  The only way this could be better is if it was shave ready when it came.  I played with it for a bit and I think I was actually able to cut some hair off with it!  Surprise to me.  Detail, well, would be nice if it looked hand carved but hey, still good detail for the price. Update: First, I have never honed anything before so that is one reason it is taking me so long to get this sharp not to mention total time I have worked on it is really only about 4 hours.  The steal seems to be better then a couple other shave ready razors I&#x27;ve bought. So, far it is safety razor 2 straight razor 0 Just ordered a shavette straight razor and I&#x27;ll see how that does.  The problem with that is since it will need replaceable blades I see no reason to use it over a safety razor.  just had to try it though. Oh, one of the shave ready razors i bought has rust marks on it while this one at 1/4 the cost is as shinny as the day I got it.  yes, I use it, just have to go over my face again with another razor since this one is not sharp yet. Shavette is a winner, wow.  Best shave so far.   I have brought this razor to another place to have it sharpened, I took it to one place and not good enough.  I&#x27;ll update you when I get this one back.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor as a gift for my boyfriend who loves shaving with a straight razor, this razor was way to heavy to shave with so just sits in the box.</li>
    <li> A very nice product came to me very quickly and packed well and would like to see this more often keep it up!</li>
    <li> absolutly perfect. real steel and heavy like a profesionals straight edge. I even had a real barber who wanted a set of these. you will not be disapointed</li>
    <li> Awesome replica, love the knife, it is actually sharp out of the box, but don&#x27;t try to shave with it. It&#x27;s a replica, not a real razor.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not sharp enough to shave with, but for under $7, you get what you pay for. I didn&#x27;t really expect it to be razor sharp, nor do I actually need it to be since I bought it as a stage prop and will probably grind the edge off anyway. The blade kinda sticks in the handle when it&#x27;s closed, but better for it to stick a bit too much than to swing too freely in my opinion, which could present some danger if you&#x27;re distracted while trying to focus on singing and acting. Overall, I think this item is a really good value for a novelty or stage prop, but if you want to have one you can actually shave with, then this is not a product you should be considering.</li>
    <li> Preface: I purchased this piece purely in the interests of bad-assery. I did not use it as a shaving razor, so this review speaks to aesthetics and workmanship only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Gorgeous design work on the handle. It&#x27;s heavy, and feels solid, and the metal is of decent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It does not come very sharp, certainly not sharp enough to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I&#x27;ve actually bought another one for my best friend, so it&#x27;s safe to say I love it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts: I believe Whetstone Cutlery also sells two in a set at a lower price than buying two individually, a fact that I wish I had known before I bought the first.</li>
    <li> I liked this Razor. Even though they are imported, they seem to fit the bill. They arrived well packaged and in good shape.</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like the picture, complete garbage. Just looks like a quickly milled piece of crap, blade wasn&#x27;t sharp at all, blade also had no polish or shine to it and the handle looks like it has scratches on it instead of the intended design. Stay away unless you want an ugly paperweight that you&#x27;d rather keep in the box.</li>
    <li> LOW COST AND GREAT QUALITY. CANT WAIT TO USE IT. DOES COME SHARP BUT NOT ENOUGH. YOU MUST SHARPEN BEFORE USE.</li>
    <li> This product is made in China and is of very poor quality. I have no idea what the intended purpose of this product is, but I can tell you it cannot be used for shaving. I purchased it for shaving. I can see the wording as Replica now and that should have been a tip of for this product. The word replica and worthless should be used when advertising this product. Amazon duped me on this.</li>
    <li> Very heavy, very well-made, very long...it is a must for any Actor&#x27;s prop supply.  I suggest coating it with WD-40 to prevent rust when stored.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m not a Sweeny Todd collector but this Razor is awesome! It&#x27;s construction is sound and the blade is sharp and huge! It&#x27;s twice the size of your normal straight razor and pretty mean looking! Now, this is NOT a razor you&#x27;d want to shave your face with. But for the price it&#x27;s definitely something awesome to add to your blade collection! This is NOT some cheap replica either. This thing candle handle pretty much anything you want to cut and isn&#x27;t going to fall apart when you&#x27;re done. It&#x27;s worth way more then what I paid for it and all my friends want to know where I bought it from! Yeah, it&#x27;s that sweet! I would buy this item again for the price and I&#x27;m actually thinking about it. If you want something that&#x27;s bad ass and looks evil in your collection, this my friends is your Razor!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a prop for a play.  I had to file the edge down to duller than a butter knife before the director and our local police chief would allow it onstage!  I hated to do this, but it looks great from the audience&#x27;s perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves it!</li>
    <li> needs a bit of sharpening when you first get it but that&#x27;s not much considering the price, its large and well weighted. great for scaring people,also great for quick quiet columbian neckties...........I&#x27;m guessing</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even believe this. I bought this because it was supposed to be a Sweeney todd REPLICA what I recieved looks absolutely nothing like the picture. The handle has no detail what so ever and the blade doesn&#x27;t look the same at all. I am not a happy camper. If I could give 0 stars I would.</li>
    <li> This product fell apart 10 minutes after i received it. The rivets are barely pressed together and the blade is barely sharp enough to cut paper, let alone shave. JUST DONT BUY.</li>
    <li> It was too rigid at first, but now the blade flies open way too easily. Needs to be sharpened if intended for actual use.</li>
    <li> outstanding service great product and love the easyness of use and information just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Heavier, longer and thicker blade than I expected. Seems pretty sharp to me but not sharp enough for shaving. The handle is ornate steel.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a novelty piece to show off but I am unimpressed. The dark metal color in the photo is just a shadow. These are metalic silver and look very cheap. To complain about $8 for this is saying much since the handle looks bad. The blade is nice on the other hand but I would not transfer that to a nicer handle since I wouldn&#x27;t try to shave with such a huge meat cleaver. Would not purchase again and not wadte my time to even waste more money to ship back out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more of a novelty than a razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was going to be cheep plastic and for the most part useless. well I was wrong it all metal and feels heavy. I like heavy makes me feel like a bought something good. I would recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> Nothing says bad ass like a straight razor ! If you liked Sweeney Todd this is extra cool . Not quite sharp enough to shave with though ... lol</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if other people who want this product want it for the same reason I do, since I actually bought it to shave with, and I&#x27;ve never actually seen Sweeney Todd. I just thought it looked really cool, and like it would do the job. I don&#x27;t really know how to use a straight edge yet, so I don&#x27;t blame the poor first shave I got off of it on the knife, which already comes sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it, I believe the highest rating I&#x27;ve ever given anything on Amazon for a reason that actually kind of annoyed me. See, in the picture, the knife is kind of dark, and super old looking and stuff, but mine was all shiny and new looking, which I suppose is a good thing.</li>
    <li> This was a reddit gift and my giftee loved it. It arrived as expected and there was much joy to be had.</li>
    <li> This knife is for decoration only. These look nice and have a decent weight to them; it is oversize compared to a real razor. The hinge holds its angle poorly, and you couldn&#x27;t cut much of anything with this. This is not for shaving; this is meant to be a movie prop.</li>
    <li> Looks nice, very impressive.  Not sharp on arrival and difficult to get a shaving edge.</li>
    <li> Whetstone is not a name I&#x27;m all that familiar with, but the thing that drew me in was the price on these and the fact that it&#x27;s real. It&#x27;s very heavy, very very sharp, and comes in a nice little non-decorative box in case you want to stow it instead of display or use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the curve of the blade an the widening at the end is great. Looks almost exactly like the blades from the movie. The length is a little short and the widening is not as exaggerated on this as it is in the movie. Aside from that, they are just about perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of the movie and I was really glad to find something that was movie accurate and yet didn&#x27;t cost me an arm and a leg. Like I said, the fact that it&#x27;s a real blade sealed the deal as one of the cooler pieces in my collection. I&#x27;ll never use this and until I find a suitable means of display it will remain in the packaging only to come out for show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a horror collector, a fan of Sweeney Todd, then you&#x27;ll want to grab this up. I can&#x27;t really speak for shaving enthusiasts, though I&#x27;d imagine with Whetstone quality it&#x27;s going to be a worthy blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Mr. Frights&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the size of the razor and its weight.  I have a small collection of vintage razors that I work with.  The Sweeney razor is a monster and really intimidates some of my customers.</li>
    <li> the razor I got in the mail just today, the one that is supposed to be this razor, is not this razor, the razor I got is bulky and ugly and not worth three dollars.</li>
    <li> If you buy this expecting it to be a plastic/wood toy prop, be warned... this bad boy is steel and sharp!</li>
    <li> I got a straight razor, but instead of any sort of Sweeny Todd replica I got one with a cheap looking, shallow acid etched woodgrain design. Unless you just feel like gambling with 10 bucks, try somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Well let&#x27;s see I got two in the mail yesterday a day early but not at all what I played for&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t the same razor as the picture completely different I&#x27;m pretty disappointed to be honest I was looking for a show piece an i got a block of steel (which edges were not smooyhednoutnat all cut my finger on the flick itself bkade was duller than a butter knife im well extremly dissapointed to say the least</li>
    <li> First things first, DO NOT SHAVE WITH THIS RAZOR!!!  This is a replica from a movie and should be treated as such.  It is sharp and very nice looking, but this is not a shave worthy razor.  That out of the way, it looks great!!!!  My only issue with it is that the blade it not centered very well, and when you close it up, the blade&#x27;s edge rubs against the metal handle.  This causes dulling and notching in the blade especially towards the tip.  But since it really has no practical purpose, its not that big of a deal to me.  Other than that I love it and will look great on a shelf in my den/mancave!</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for: I can&#x27;t use it because it is too dull. Looks cool, but it just isn&#x27;t usable.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect to shave with this unless you sharpen the hell out of it because its quite dull. Also the blade on mine is different than the picture, more rounded on the top. It still looks cool but it doesn&#x27;t look like the one from the movie. I sharpened it a bit and I was able to cut through some cardboard boxes with ease. Fast shipping and cheap. How bout a shave?</li>
    <li> Bought this already knowing it wasn&#x27;t a true straight razor. But it looks cool and is sharp for a 5 dollar knife.  Not a fan of the add on requirements to purchase but it is what it is I guess.</li>
    <li> Pros: Good for costume appearance, will slice someones throat(not that I have tried), sturdy, and is somewhat of a replica    Cons: Not really authentic, made out of a cheaper material than sterling silver, joint becomes stiff then breaks in and loosens the blade, and the design on the handle is different from the picture</li>
    <li> I bought this item to shave with. Shocking I know who would have thought to buy a razor to actually do what they are made for. For 1 mine looks kind of like the picture I guess....well I mean it is metal. 2 I could probably sharpen a spoon to be shave ready before I get this piece of crap sharp. Only reason I bought it is because I don&#x27;t want to take my expensive razor on trips... You can get a better shave with a cheese grater. If you want a cheap razor to shave with go to the dollar store and buy one of the twin blade store brand blue razors.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed.</li>
    <li> the handle is two pieces of metal and somewhat cheep however the blade is nice and the picture depicted the knife perfectly</li>
    <li> It LOOKS great as a stage prop for Sweeney Todd. (Though it is somewhat sharp, you are an idiot if you are rating it poorly because you couldn&#x27;t shave with it!) I would love to give this 5 stars for it&#x27;s appearance alone, but during my performance the screw at the base holding the handle pieces together fell out and I nearly cut myself :(</li>
    <li> I Love This Razor. I Would Recommend This To Any Knife Collector Or If Your A Johnny Depp Fan To</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! All i gotta say......&lt;br /&gt;You obviously cant shave with it (to those idiots out there) but you can kill with it :)))&lt;br /&gt;so thumbs up all around</li>
    <li> I use it as a work Knife. Its Pretty Durable, I&#x27;m sure You could sharpin it up to pretty good. But a Great buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not sharp enough to shave with.  But as a theatre prop, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> An amazing piece of art. I got it for my girlfriend and she was so excited to get it. It&#x27;s so nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;, giving this 5 stars because it&#x27;s stylish as all hell. I have no idea how it works as a razor, because I bought it for a movie prop. So, I don&#x27;t mind that it came unsharpened and wouldn&#x27;t even cut paper. For me it&#x27;s great, because I don&#x27;t have to worry about my actors accidentally slicing themselves. However, if you&#x27;re buying this and you actually want to shave with it, you&#x27;ll need to have or get a sharpening stone or some such.</li>
    <li> big blade got just for deco</li>
    <li> My husband ordered one for himself and one our son. It&#x27;s way too big and difficult to handle. They won&#x27;t be using them at all.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It is better in person than I expected. I got it for my collection. It is definitely worth displaying.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I gave this as a Birthday gift to a friend, who is a big &amp;#34;Sweeny Todd&amp;#34; fan. They loved it. His barber really loved it.</li>
    <li> this replica is cool and fun to have, but not very sharp. if you want this for shaving, i would not recommend but for a collection, i would definitely recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Neat item to look at but fell apart just taking it out of box. The fastner r/e pop ribbot  that holds the handle together came apart and the blade went all the way through and cut my finger. Understand that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a replica. BUT IT SHOULD ATLEAST STAY SAFE TO HANDLE. No pun intended.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this....fast shipping</li>
    <li> the good thing is that it looks very accurate to the movie. the bad news is, there is no way to shave with it as soon as it gets to your doorstep. its far from &#x27;razor sharp&#x27; but if you have the means of honing it down and thinning out the blade, thats the only way to shave with it. making it sharp is just time consuming. but the price is pretty decent for the product.</li>
    <li> This product is more for looks and show then for use</li>
    <li> I loved this razor it came so quick that I was suprised. It is quite sharp many reveiws say it is not \\&quot;shave ready\\&quot; but when my razor had arrived was like what probably 3 days after I orderd it and to me it is \\&quot;shave ready\\&quot; because lastnight I tried it out and it was the best shave I had ever had. The handle on the razor isnt just like the one on the movie because the movie razor has a woman on the handle and the hair flowing down the handle. If you are looking for a verry spitting image of the movie razor that would be the NECA SWEENEY TODD STRAIGHT RAZOR which cost you like probably about 30 more dollars but this one to me will safice. So I reccomend this razor to anyone who is noit tool picky.</li>
    <li> Useless is all i can say.</li>
    <li> This had been my fourth failed purchase for a Sweeney Todd Replica and instead of what&#x27;s shown in the picture, I received a straight razor with the handle looking more like a poorly carved wood grain than any intricate and surely not the film&#x27;s blade design. I&#x27;m very confused. I see reviews of people who got what they saw and others who received the same as mine. Please don&#x27;t advertise what you&#x27;re not actually selling! Would not recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a replica.</li>
    <li> Great prop - feels good, can definitely be used as it a razor, but it&#x27;s a prop for me (for now).</li>
    <li> good looking, but remember its a replica. its not honed for shaving</li>
    <li> Replica!! This is not a shaver.  like the idiot i am, i did not see that title.  Read discription before buying.  this is NOT meant to shave your face with...</li>
    <li> Very nice. It&#x27;s sharp and sturdy and has weight. I used my electric knife sharpner to give it a nice edge, it&#x27;s great to open mail or other stuff. But, it&#x27;s not really meant to shave with.</li>
    <li> My son was performing a Sweeney Todd song at school and we bought these as a prop, they are really sharp! Maybe I should have known better! My Dad had to grind these down which totally ruined the dramatic effect according to my son but hey, he wasn&#x27;t arrested for taking a weapon to school, I guess he can add this embarrassment to the grist of his artistic mill.</li>
    <li> beautiful knives, very similar to the movie.  Sharp!</li>
    <li> This was super cool. Very well made and worth the money. I would definetly buy this blade again and i would recommend it</li>
    <li> Nice knife to look at but you get what you pay for. If you want a knife to shave with dont buy this unless you want to spend hours sharpening and honing it in. It said in description that its ready to shave but that is definitely not true.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use and it is impossible to sharpen. Now its just in a display as decoration. Get what you pay for..</li>
    <li> Ok, so i got it on time, early even, and though it is a silver replica straight razor, its handle is entirely different from the one in the pictures, and the blade is a round point, not the square one you see. in fact, it shows a perfect resemblance to this item:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;long story short, dont expect it to look similar out of your hand. as long as you cover the handle, nobody can tell on stage.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, I think I can shave with it. I use it to cut clones with. Very cool looking and it doubles as protection also! Swish!!!! Blood everywhere...lol JK</li>
    <li> YOU&#x27;RE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be honest, this thing is under ten dollars, if you really think you&#x27;re gonna shave with this, you&#x27;re gonna get the shave you deserve. Regardless of what the description says, if you have used a straight razor before (assuming you have) you know this is a piece of crap in the first place (cost wise, it just doesn&#x27;t add up to a good shave. Going to a barber will cost you nearly double to give you a single shave). It also says replica which is obviously a major warning as it&#x27;s for Halloween costumes or for theatrical plays or collecting. Do not buy this if you are determined to shave with this. One more time: DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE DETERMINED TO SHAVE WITH THIS. You have to spend at least a good sixty dollars (the lowest i&#x27;d say) to get a somewhat decent straight razor.</li>
    <li> This is probably the coolest knife I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s huge (11.5\\&quot; open) and it&#x27;s razor sharp.  I didn&#x27;t get it for shaving or anything.  Just as a knife to \\&quot;play with\\&quot; and it&#x27;s everything I hoped for and more.  It&#x27;s made of all metal and it&#x27;s just solid all around.  High quality and it looks amazing.  I don&#x27;t know about using it for shaving though, if you want a straight razor for shaving get a legit straight razor, not a sweeney todd replica.  But as far as this being a totally functional wicked knife, IT IS.</li>
    <li> This item should state, NOT FOR SHAVING. Got this for my husband and he hates it. Junk.  This is more for a display than actual shaving.</li>
    <li> Wow this Sweeney Todd replica is really nice,obbiously iam not going to shave with it but it still bad ass cant wait to show my freinds.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Heavy, solid metal. Not really for shaving, but makes sN interesting pocketknife!</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t even sharp very cheaply made garbage</li>
    <li> Recently discovered Sweeney Todd and immediately ordered these. I love movie replicas, and this one is my favorite so far. From the two I got, one loosely swings when the other is tight. Overall, I love these! Would really love to see an exact screen replica, but these do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Differences:&lt;br /&gt;-It is not shiny like the picture or movie&lt;br /&gt;-The design looks like it may be laser etched.&lt;br /&gt;-The teeth-looking part below the blade does not look the same.&lt;br /&gt;- On the top part of the blade on one side it says &amp;#34;440-STAINLESS STEEL - CHINA&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it only took me less than a day to cut myself with it... &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> it is perfect 100% like the one in the movie i love sowing it off  i wish i could get a set of them</li>
    <li> This is perfect for your general costume needs.&lt;br /&gt;If however you&#x27;re looking for an exact replica for say a cosplay of Sweeney Todd, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;For a critic free costume party I went to it was perfect! Cheap and quite sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Do be aware that with just a bit of honing or fine sharpening you could actually shave with this razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a Christmas present for my grandson and he just loved it and has used it every day since.</li>
    <li> When I found this product on amazon I didn&#x27;t expect it to be all that great because of the price. I just needed a cheap prop for my fiance&#x27;s Sweeney Todd costume for Halloween. I thought it was going to be more like the one they offered at the Spirit Halloween store for 16 bucks which is cheaply made of plastic but wow was I wrong! This is the most gorgeous thing I have ever seen and it&#x27;s durable! It&#x27;s made of stainless steel, which perhaps in my haste to find a cheap prop, I missed that detail in the description. When it came in and my fiance opened it he got so excited! He absolutely loves it and so do I. It&#x27;ll be with us for a very long time after Halloween as a keepsake. I would recommend this product and this seller to my friends and anyone looking for props like this. It&#x27;s definitely worth more than the little bit of money you&#x27;ll spend on it!</li>
    <li> Perhaps if the balde could be sharpened, it may work but as is, it is only a replica to place in a drawer for viewing,</li>
    <li> Well done my friends... That is all</li>
    <li> I was a big fan of the movie and have always wanted to see the play, but its almost the same as the prop from the movie.  The only thing that sucks is that it says &amp;#34;china&amp;#34; on the front of the blade; but honestly for the price and the idea that its really cool to have</li>
    <li> I ordered this a while ago haven&#x27;t got the chance to open the package till few days ago I received a totally different razor looks different not sharp at all and almost impossible to sharpen I mean if it was the design that&#x27;s different that would of been fine but its like I ordered a shoe and revived a tie instead !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful quality product but I wish the description said you can&#x27;t really shave with it...  however it&#x27;s sharp just not razor sharp...  It&#x27;s heavy &amp; beautiful though...  Just wish I could shave with them...</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for, no more no less, could use some stropping on arrival. Caution: does NOT look like the one in the picture, not the sweeny todd razor from the movie but still worth the money you pay, good razor overall, kind of a let down when I unboxed it,was expecting the dark grey sweeny todd razor, instead got a silver differently designed razor than the one fro the film, still like it though, good razor overall</li>
    <li> Really Bad Ass Straight Razor! Just Need To Know How To Make It Sharper Now :( real good trustworthy company i approve from SAN ANTONIO TEXAS GO SPURS GO</li>
    <li> This product was affordable and the quality was even better than I expected!</li>
    <li> Thought I would be able to shape my hair line with this but not possible at all as the product is not sharp.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is a great item. My boyfriend loved the quality of it and tried it out instantly.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and well constructed. Came razor sharp. These people are needy, I can&#x27;t write a simple review. I gotta write at least 20 characters. What&#x27;s wrong with short and sweet?</li>
    <li> I bought this as a display piece solely on the the artwork of the handle. The item that arrived does not have a black handle with etchings like the one pictured. The one I received has a silver handle with what seems to be a mock woodgrain print. I know this product is cheap but it looks completely different from the one pictured. It was only $8 and the world isn&#x27;t going to end over it being different but I won&#x27;t be ordering from these people again.</li>
    <li> Cool little straight razor... and sharp enough for me.  Nice detail on the handle, sturdy construction, hefty weight, not really &#x27;bling-bling&#x27; shiny either.  You could shave with it though I don&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s not what I bought it for.  It&#x27;ll cut something open though.</li>
    <li> The straight razor arrived sooner than I had expected, and the photo shown here on Amazon truly does not do this beautiful razor justice in the least. It is highly polished with a blinding shine... it is almost too beautiful to use. However, it will be used. This was purchased as a gift for my husband, and it will be given to him when he returns home from his deployment. I always try to find something special and functional for him each time he has to leave, and this is going to be one of those jaw-dropping, unexpected surprises. He is going to absolutely love this!! Thank you for such a wonderful, amazing product, and for the promptness in the ordering/shipping process.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT FOR SHAVING! That being said it is an excellent prop.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not for shaving, but makes a formidable knife.  The metal is Chinese steel, and doesn&#x27;t hold its edge for very long, but if you know how to hone a blade, it&#x27;ll keep pretty sharp.</li>
    <li> AMAZING.  Greatest EVER...........................................................Tried others, this is the best. 100% Fantastic.  Just a terrific product.  Would buy again as a gift</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of this replica.&lt;br /&gt;Of course it isn&#x27;t very sharp, but it was a great Halloween prop and endured a lot of handling and abuse.&lt;br /&gt;If you sharpened it correctly, it might actually shave fairly well.</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like the picture. Total crap. Mine won&#x27;t even open. How is it legal to advertise this and sell something different?</li>
    <li> This is cheap so you really can&#x27;t expect much from it. The screw on it dropped the first day. Just to let you know this thing is huge.</li>
    <li> This blade is actually really good quality. Can&#x27;t believe it was that cheap. My best friend loves it! In fact wanting to buy a few more. Great durable blade. Excellent quality! I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> My son loved it. It was a Christmas present to him from me and I&#x27;m sure I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I like my replica straight razor knife, kind of heavy but thats ok with me. My order came on time</li>
    <li> Love it great product for collectors that love the movie! not really for use on face or for shaving but great for collecting!</li>
    <li> Great conversation piece.  Not sure I&#x27;d attempt to shave with it, others have though.  Actually a nice knife.</li>
    <li> Ignore the imbeciles who say you cannot shave with this blade. What they mean is that this does not come pre-sharpened for shaving. That just means you should be ready to send it to a sharpener or do it yourself to get this blade hair-slicing sharp. Those same critics may not realize that eventually they will need to have even pre-sharpened blades re-sharpened. Worked fine for shaving after a few hours sharpening by hand with a whetstone, though there was definitely a lot of metal that had to be ground off to get the right blade angle, thus it loses one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design on the handle was as pictured, the curve of the blade worked well for shaving, and the mineral oil residue left after sharpening left the bearing greased so the blade easily opened and closed, which it did fine even before the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to know I never have to tap my Gillette razors against the sink anymore to unclog hair from the blades and that I never have to spend cash on replacement blades. This blade is also quite large; you could sharpen it every day if you were so compelled and it should still last for years.</li>
    <li> The blade is great but the handle is simply an etched piece of steel without the deep grooves or black coloring.</li>
    <li> Looks great. The price was awesome. I got this for a gift to my son</li>
    <li> i felt perfick with this razor and for a good pricse i love it i would get it agin and agin</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality.  We used it for our production of Sweeney Todd.  It was a bit sharp so we sanded it down for safety!</li>
    <li> I really liked it. Super sharp.</li>
    <li> Knife was awesome&lt;br /&gt;Loved the detail and the size&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is that it was not sharpen&lt;br /&gt;I also had to purchase extra item to sharpen it&lt;br /&gt;But its well worth the price&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> For anyone considering using these razors in a production of Sweeney Todd:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My director bought 2 of these and they are, indeed, beautiful! They do \\&quot;shine like silver\\&quot;. But do beware... they arrive SHARP! Maybe not shaving quality but they can slice meat quite easily! To keep from slicing up my colleagues, I simply took some shiny clear tape and folded it over the blade -- with a fraction of an inch space off the actual edge. This allowed me to cleanly \\&quot;shave\\&quot; lather off the faces of my fellow actors without risk of injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: the little brass &#x27;rivets&#x27; are NOT strong! The ones that hold the blade in place survived but those that hold together the other end of the handles popped right out, just from Pirelli dropping it on the floor a couple of shows during our struggle. I was able to use more of the clear tape to hold it together (and from a distance, the audience was none the wiser) but our &#x27;run&#x27; was only 6 performances + dress rehearsals. DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO LAST FOR AN 8 OR 12 WEEK RUN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even then, however, I plan on getting a couple for myself!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this I was very nervous because I saw some not so great reviews saying it was flimsy and broke quickly. My husband had it on his Christmas wishlist though so I decided to go with it.  It is sturdy and well made! It is exactly what he wanted!</li>
    <li> Exceeded all expectations! Great novelty piece! I even used it a few times! Love it! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> This is really a good deal, the handle is exquisitly designed and the blade is, well by all accounts, enormous.  Very easy to sharpen and yes, it is capable of actually shaving. Be careful though.  Only problem I see with it is that once unfolded, the blade swings freely on the hinge.  Maybe this is something that can be fixed by taking the tool apart but I am not mechanically inclined to do this.  All in all, real bargain for the price, I do feel a bit like Depp holding this.</li>
    <li> This is my first straight razor purchase and for the price I&#x27;d do it again in a heartbeat. The quality and weight is really great, also the blade is super sharp. Not yet sure if I&#x27;ll use it to shave as its so large I&#x27;d probably end up with more scars than I&#x27;d like, but its a nice blade if you&#x27;re a typically guy.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to buy this item as a cheap way to begin learning how to care for and use a straight razor. I was expecting it to be dull when I received it, and in need of honing. For the first hone, I took it to a professional.  Unforurtenatly, I was informed there that this piticular razor is too thick to ever be adaquatly honed for shaving quality. He could put an edge on it, but it would not provide a quality shave, nor would the edge last.  Further, had I have tried to learn to care for it I would have only been successful in destroying my leather strap.&lt;br /&gt;  When brand new, any proper straight razor will be dull and need honeing, but this one will never be a useful tool. It is a novelty, a letter opener, or a costume item at best. I would not advise this for beginners especially, as the experience will only turn you off to the world of shaving. An affordable alternative for beginners would be a razor that takes disposable blades. Mine was only $20, and a years worth of blades was another $10. From this I have learned how to shave properly. Now I continue to search, and apparently now save my money for an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;  Again- Do Not Buy This Razor for the purpose of shaving.</li>
    <li> Recurved it promptly and was excited until I opened and realized it is completely different looking than what I ordered and is not sharp enough to shave. Very unhappy!!!</li>
    <li> Do not yet top shave with it. It has a good weight and appears to be good quality but the blade won&#x27;t even cut my finger or hair. Don&#x27;t shave unless you want a torn face.&lt;br /&gt;Ran it across a leather strop for half an hour. Still can&#x27;t cut my son.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like even a $8 razor could be moderately sharp. Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Worthless shaver.  Took it to a knife shop for honing.  Was able to shave once after that.  Moving on to a real razor.</li>
    <li> Gives a shave to die for. I didn&#x27;t get this razor for its looks and it does really work great!</li>
    <li> This is an exact replica of one of the &amp;#34;ladies&amp;#34; used by Johnny Depp in his role as Sweeney Todd. The blade is stupidly sharp for a prop replica.  Razor sharp, ya might say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I shave with it?  Maybe after a lot of prep.  Is it a suitable straight razor?  Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;One, it&#x27;s huge and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Two, the steel, while nice, is not going to hold an edge after even light use.&lt;br /&gt;Three, it costs less than some disposable blades... do the math.&lt;br /&gt;Four, its a friggin&#x27; prop replica.  What are ya doing with this thing near your jugular?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this thing is mighty sweet and has a place right next to Mal&#x27;s pistol, Luke&#x27;s Lightsaber and Sting in the display case.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why there are mixed reviews...it looks exactly like the picture. The word CHINA is NOT on the blade and the blade is pretty sharp.</li>
    <li> The item that I received looks NOTHING like on the photos. It is a very heavy knife that looks like a razor blade. Not sharp enough for shaving. Has a big word \\&quot;CHINA\\&quot; on the blade. The blade is round shape. Looks really cool, but has nothing to do with Sweeney Todd movie. Bottom line, it is not what i ordered</li>
    <li> While it is an amazing work of art.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason it lacks a star is, the description said it is ready to be used to shave, NOT AT ALL!&lt;br /&gt;I needed to used the strop for over 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My arm was so tired, I just left it for another day.</li>
    <li> One Word, INCREDIBLE. I love this, its an amazing replica, very well made. I have it on display and you can clearly tell where its from.</li>
    <li> This was much better made then I anticipated. It has a thick, sharp heavy blade and a well constructed handle for the money.</li>
    <li> Except for being broken when I opened the box, this knife (CHEAP replica) was what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth sending back, postage is more than knife cost.&lt;br /&gt;After repairing the bolster with a $2.00 brass rod as a bolster (rivet) it works OK now.&lt;br /&gt;Looks OK, Works OK, Kind of sharp, but how long will it last? Well, at least I have 11 1/2 inches of 1/8 brass rod left to repair the other end.&lt;br /&gt; It is not plastic and added to my collection of cheap knifes so I gave it TWO stars.</li>
    <li> Great Display Item, gets sharp and can cut. Beware.</li>
    <li> My fault, larger than i expected.</li>
    <li> The razor would not take an edge -- cheap imported steel.  I bought an antique German razor from my barber and relegated this piece of junk to my kitchen utility drawer.  It does make a nice garlic slicer.</li>
    <li> First, this s not really a straight  razor.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a stainless steel knife blade in the shape of a straight razor.  Once you get past that, this is a cool copy of the razor from the movie.  If you know how to sharpen knives, you can get really sharp, but not sharp enough to shave!</li>
    <li> This is ok. I got it because I found one for $7.85 and I thought If I scewed it up hoaning it wasn&#x27;t a huge lose. It is dull so plan on spending a lot of time hoaning it. There are better razors out there. It looks great, but if you are looking for a serious shave razor this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Nothing like what was described in the advertisement.  It has a rounded tip and ALOT smaller than the picture, completely different design than in the picture.  Definitely sending back. I would love to sue for false advertising.</li>
    <li> Okay so first off this item deserves a 10 out of 10 in my opinion.  First off it is incredibly detailed even down to the carving of the woman on the handle of the blade I even watched the movie and compared the handle to the one in the film, as a lot of people have complained about that part.  now let&#x27;s go to the pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: 1. Wonderfully detailed and very well designed.&lt;br /&gt;2. a very inexpensive purchase and a great feel to the blade very very heavy at the handle to give balance and control over the blade.&lt;br /&gt;3. The blade is exactly like his and is stainless steel, the blade is also incredibly well pplished so well polished that I was able to see my reflection in the blade.&lt;br /&gt;4. again Just like Sweeney&#x27;s it is so important that I have to say it twice, this blade is EXACTLY like the blade used by Johnny Depp in the movie Tim Burton&#x27;s Sweeney Todd the demon arber of fleet street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  there aren&#x27;t that many cons or complaints I have with the blade maybe 2 if I really think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The blade is pretty dull i mean this is NOT a toy and it will slice a throat if you try so yes it will cut a throat like Sweeney Todd. While it is sharp I was able to drag my finger across it without it doing much other than taking off some dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. this won&#x27;t shave at all It is a collectors item but I would have liked to use it as an actual shaving razor I feel that it would&#x27;ve been pretty neat to shave with this unfortuanately again like I said in my first complaint it is not really sharp at all not sharp enough at least to cut hairs off my chin and cheek.  other than those it is a fantastic purchase and i am considering buying a couple more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL THOUGHT!  again while the blade is not that sharp or as sharp as I had hoped the straight razor is so well detailed and it looks so much like Sweeney Todd&#x27;s that any fan of Tim Burton or Sondhiem&#x27;s musical needs to own this razor. It deserves a 10 out of 10 score and being able to watch the movie and see all the carvings on the blade and then take this razor out and see those same exact carvings is a really cool feeling so cool that everytime I take out the blade I start singing \\&quot;My Friends\\&quot;  and the carvings don&#x27;t look fake either the woman carved onto the handle looks exactly like the woman carved on the handle in the movie. The attention to detail is astonishing and to be honest I Would&#x27;ve payed even more for this blade than the 7 bucks I payed for it.and being able to watch the movie and see all the carvings on the blade and then take this razor out and see those same exact carvings is a really cool feeling so cool that everytime I take out the blade I start singing \\&quot;My Friends\\&quot;  and the carvings don&#x27;t look fake either the woman carved onto the handle looks exactly like the woman carved on the handle in the movie.

    <li> Not really a fan of using the blade but it was very inexpensive and it seems pretty well built.</li>
    <li> I bought this. I wish I didn&#x27;t, but I did. And now I am facing the electric chair. Let me explain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I loved the movie. It&#x27;s one of my favorites. Depp i just so... &amp;#34;dashing.&amp;#34; I fell in love with him. His acting. His voice. His looks. Everything. That being said, I wanted to be him. No... not him... not Johnny. Todd. Sweeney, that is. I started barber school. I started eating meat pies. I started wearing make up. I lost all my friends, but I was happy. WAS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; About two weeks ago, I was browsing the online for weird top hats. I searched several places before I landed in the Amazon. After typing in &amp;#34;Sweeney Todd&amp;#34; in the search bar, this popped up. It was meant to be. I bought it. I bought more than one. Again, I wish I hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As I waited for it to ship (i couldn&#x27;t splurge for the expedited shipping because I had purchased the actual chair from the movie) I started practicing my technique. I used a Popsicle stick in place of a razor, but hey, who needs technique when you have pizzazz? I still don&#x27;t know how I managed to pop so many balloons with smooth wood. 4 Business days later, it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did an unboxing video for this item, but it was taken down because apparently youtube doesn&#x27;t appreciate art. Art being fully nude covered in a slick layer of shave cream. I opened it. I looked at it. I smelled it. I became it. I opened my doors to a few neighbors. I offered free shaves to everyone. Oddly enough, no one accepted - that is... until someone accepted. And then it happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It took some coaxing to get him into my home, but then again, dragging a completely comatose 240 pound man up a gravel driveway at midnight isn&#x27;t exactly a piece of cake - or in this case, a piece of meat pie... but I did it. I sat him up in the chair. His chest was heaving. At first I thought he was almost as excited as me, but in reality, it was probably just his lungs fighting to counteract the respiratory depression from all the sedatives. I took out Johnny (that&#x27;s what I named the razor. Johnny.) and it&#x27;s devilish blade gleamed in the flickering fluorescent lighting of my bathroom - which reminded me that the FedEx guy had not delivered my bulbs that I had also bought from my visit in the Amazon. I raised it up, and then everything went black...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After I changed the bulb out, I could see again. Luckily, I had a spare in the garage. I say that word like I was in the movie. Like, GARE-Ahj. Try it. Gare-ajj. It&#x27;s fun. I put the blade to the man&#x27;s throat. I sliced. The rest is history. This blade turned me into a murderer. And now, 3 days later, I am paying for my crimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would kill again.</li>
    <li> Not an accurate description the product is actually a simple Stainless Steel Barber Razor Classic, its neither darkish metal nor with any detailed design.</li>
    <li> Not sharp enough to shave with straight out of the box, but that&#x27;s easily fixed. A nice solid piece. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Laughable used as decoration but you get what you pay for can not shave with it</li>
    <li> IT CAME FAST AND WAS BIGGER THAN EXPECTED ALSO I HEARD IT WASNT SHARP BUT IT CAME VERY SHARP USUALLY ANYTHING FROM WHETSTONE CUTLERY COMES VERY SHARP AND ITS A NICE REPLICA IM HAPPY ABOUT THIS BUY</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted, works great too! i am never going back to old razors because they pale in comparison</li>
    <li> Poor etching, slightly raised, too many inaccuracies, not as described in description, have compared in detail and this is not remotely close to being a replica. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> it is a good buy, not as sharp as I would like so buy with the sharpening belt. overall a good buy</li>
    <li> I use straight edge razors myself and own a soap stone to sharpen. I sharpened this product figuring with some time and effort it would be a usable blade. The product is nothing like the picture and shipping took weeks over the expected arrival time. not worth more than three dollars.</li>
    <li> I attempted to purchase (2) of these straight razors, however the seller sent me (2) completly different items. One of the blades was even damaged. I contacted the seller and stated that what I received was a different color (silver) the handle design was different, and one blade was damaged. The seller stated that this was the correct product but the picture made the color look different. I then said the design is obviously different. The seller then said I can ship them back and he will ship the new ones. So I have to pay to ship your mistake?? When I refused this deal he said he would give me 30% back (which I did not take.) A partial refund does not make up for your errors and lack of customer service.</li>
    <li> Blades get too lose after many uses but love the design</li>
    <li> Very satisfied the quality is great really heavy duty. And the engraving is great looks just like the movie. It&#x27;s sharp but not sharp enough to shave with. But it will cut you be cautious using</li>
    <li> i have yet to get this razor sharp enough to shave my arm hair, the blade is resisting being sharpend, what do i mean? ive spent hours with a wet stone and have barely made a dent, when i can get my knifes sharper faster then i can a razor then theres something wrong, probably going to have to take it to my bench grinder</li>
    <li> Big, heavy, not for shaving. Awesome for a prop or light duty knife.</li>
    <li> This damn thing looks absolutely nothing like the picture, absolutely misleading in every way. Very disappointing, was really looking forward to it too:(</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t sharpen. But pretty</li>
    <li> Very very sharp. Will shave hair easily.</li>
    <li> The blade look just like it did in the picture. I see that some people got a blade that looked a lot different. Maybe you&#x27;re just taking a chance in getting a good or bad when when you buy but  loved mine! It&#x27;s not very sharp not sharp enough to cut someone anyway but I&#x27;m fine with that, just using it as a Halloween prop. I plan on being a girl version of Sweeney Todd and this will work perfectly :) I can&#x27;t seem to post pictures but here&#x27;s the link to my facebook where I posted images of the product.   https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid&#x3D;799802580078286&amp;l&#x3D;5bdff58c2e</li>
    <li> Just for showing, kind of disappointed, you really can&#x27;t use it...</li>
    <li> Cool novelty! But that&#x27;s all it is and should be used for. It looks cool but is pretty poorly made, loose housing. Incorrect fits at some points. Maybe bc I&#x27;m used to Benchmade. Cold steel and CRKT... But other than that it is a great novelty piece!</li>
    <li> Its obviously not shave worthy.  It can be sharpened.  Its defenantly not a hollow ground blade it is a flat ground.  It has a nice decorative scales ( look like a female body) .blade is shiny.  But not mirror finish.  It feels well built. And its a nice item. I know nothing about Sweeney Todd. Recommend it to any one that has a few dollars laying around.  It ships quick also.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my friend and he seemed pleased with it. It looks nice and feels nice, with a good weight to it. Opens and closes smoothly.</li>
    <li> we may do sweenjey todd for production and i just bought this item to show it off. it&#x27;s a great prop exactly from the movie and i enjoy this trinket very much.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about it.  The picture was misleading.  It&#x27;s pretty sharp but not something you can actually use unless you want a letter opener.</li>
    <li> ALl that this is good for is to play with.  Do not attempt to shave with it or do anything else but put it on a shelf for display.</li>
    <li> this thing is huge for a straight razor, it is sharp as well and the all metal design is higher quality than most</li>
    <li> Must be good; my wife confiscated it for use in the kitchen. Has a good feel, looks good and works extremely well for slicing vegetables or meat. Recommended highly for every kitchen.</li>
