<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> makes everything silky smooth</li>
    <li> I love this lotion especially in the winter.  My skin gets dry during the winter and I love to use this.  It is non-greasy and not much smell.  My legs love it!</li>
    <li> I live in Houston, very hot you feel like melting in the summer, well this lotion absorbs very quickly it has a very light shimmer which I love hydrates my skin perfectly, my skin feels absolutely soft and supple I dont need to reapply during the day like other lotions I absolutely love this, I&#x27;m so excited I want to scream! I love touching my skin it feels extremly soft and beautiful, I have never been as satisfied with any other body lotion ever and I really mean this I hope they never discontinue it because I don&#x27;t know what else I could replace it with, I&#x27;m sure the magic ingredient is argan oil I love thus stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this lotion. I have brown skin and I notice after using it my skin does have a healthy glow, and I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments on my complexion. I can still smell it after a long day, and it&#x27;s non greasey. I also use the shampoo brand and love it as well.  Definitely would recommend this product however you have to keep using to see results.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. It smells so good, it feels so good. Best lotion ever.</li>
    <li> This is a very good lotion, makes my skin really soft! I will buy more as soon as I can get over Christmas debt.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best I have ever used.  It moisturizes without the greasy feeling and it smells wonderful and leaves your skin a glow.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  All I buy.</li>
    <li> This lotion is really nice. Has a lovely scent to it, not overpowering and softens my skin.</li>
    <li> Great lotion really helps with dry skin that comes with the long Ohio winter we just had.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my mom. The product itself is good and she was very happy with it. My only complaint is that I paid more for them than I would have if I&#x27;d just gone to the local store.</li>
    <li> Before using, I had clear skin and haven&#x27;t had an outbreak in years. Just two weeks of using it left my skin torn up from contact eczema (patching, tearing, scaling, shedding, discoloring, and erosions) and painful itching. Never did I have a eczema outbreak so bad and now on two different types of topical medications! Even the eczema is on trival places such as my knuckles! It&#x27;s even a pain to bend over and I can&#x27;t even sleep on my back at night anymore! A light slap on my back will have me wincing. HOWEVER, my brother (who didn&#x27;t inherit this crappy skin) used this for a month now and his skin is clean as a whistle. I used this on my face (super bad idea...) and it left my eyes and nose in scales, red, and puffy and now Im on allergy medication. If I can go back in time with the same knowledge I have today (which I would, believe me), I wouldn&#x27;t have brought this lotion WHAT-SO-EVER. Do NOT buy this lotion if you have hyper sensitive skin or a history of eczema! I CERTAINLY learned my lesson of buying cheap lotions.</li>
    <li> This lotion works really fast and makes your skin feel like silk. I don&#x27;t usually like lotion but I like this one because it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I swim in a heavy chlorine pool. I use this cream after I take a shower at the pool. This cream helps my skin to feel moist.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m a lotion fanatic. I&#x27;ve tried every brand and fragrance I can get my hands on. I recently moved to Florida and all of my usual lotions and creams felt sticky in the heat. I even tried the fast drying Vaseline for Men body lotion (hoping that gross feeling would go away)... No luck. Until I came across this lotion on sale at CVS the other day. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it without the sale, but I am so happy I did! Subtle fragrance, a small amount goes a long way, and NO sweating it off throughout the day in the heat. I will be sticking with this brand. My skin feels so amazing even a few hours after I apply it. It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for since my move!&lt;br /&gt;**minor detail: it has a slight \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; that I barely noticed when I first applied it. It&#x27;s hardly anything anyone else would notice and I actually l liked the \\&quot;healthy look\\&quot; it added to my somewhat fair skin.</li>
    <li> Tremendously good product for keeping the skin smooth and soft. Smells wonderful! I would definitely purchase this product again next time.</li>
    <li> This lotion leaves your skin so soft and smooth, better than any other lotion I have ever used.  I would recommend this to anyone,  In fact I purchased enough bottles so I could give to my daughters.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and a little goes a long way. Works well in dry environments, Keeps me nice and moisturized on dry days. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful .. so so on the softness ... but ill keep buying it</li>
    <li> I love this. I read other reviews where they stated that their skin was still dry after using this. I did not find this to be the case. It is moisturizing. It leaves my skin feeling soft ,  and it has a lovely scent. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I had dry skin from the winter weather &amp; this really help to moisten it. Love this product &amp; the way it has helped me! GL</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. It&#x27;s a good nourishing lotion with the well-known benefits of argan oil, that is still light and smells delicious! I also like the shimmering finish that it leaves on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Not only does it hydrate but it leaves your skin feeling smooth and smelling yummy. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and it goes well with the same scented shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.</li>
    <li> I use OGX hair products and have been happy with them.  I love the smell of this lotion and a little goes a long way, however, it does not keep my skin moisturized all day.  I do have to reapply some days.  A nice light lotion.</li>
    <li> I have the hair wash and conditioner along with body wash in this product line so as I had free shipping for a while decided to try this  lotion. Oh, I am so satisfied with this lotion. Does all the wonderful &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; things it supposed to do but has that exquisite perfume to luxuriate in. Yes I just let it wrap around me like the softest towel. OK, I went far enough with this.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I love this lotion.  It takes a tiny bit longer to rub into your skin compared to other lotions I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s worth the extra time because it is SO moisturizing with the addition of the moroccan oil.  I also really like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love love love this lotion and refuse to use anything else now! I got all my friends hooked on it to! So worth the money for a good quality product.</li>
    <li> Love it and use it after every shower.  I love the smell and the way it smooths my skin. I will buy more</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that I didn&#x27;t like this lotion because I love anything Argon Oil. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but the first thing I noticed was that the consistency was very watery. The smell is amazing(earned the second star), but the smell disappears as soon as you put it on. My skin did not feel hydrated at all after application. It was as though I never put any lotion on at all. Will not be repurchasing again.</li>
    <li> I already use the Organix Moroccan Oil hair products and now I LOVE the lotion!!  Works well on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* It smells great.&lt;br /&gt;* It moisturizes well.&lt;br /&gt;* The consistency is perfect. It is not oily, heavy or thick, thin or watery.&lt;br /&gt;* It absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;* It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing. (I&#x27;ve accidentally gotten it on cotton, polyester, spandex, and most other commonly-used clothing materials, and it has always wiped right off. On rare occasions it has left a little spot, but that completely disappears in the washing machine).&lt;br /&gt;* It feels refreshing on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;* It does not cause clogged pores or ingrown hairs when used right after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;* Although it doesn&#x27;t need to be used more than once a day, I love this lotion so much that I use it on my legs, arms, feet, and hands, several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;* This bottle lasts several months for me, and I am one to use products quite generously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None over the course of the year+ that I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
    <li> Very smooth and creamy. It does the job on my dry skin and pleasantly scented. Just wish the bottle was a pump.</li>
    <li> I Love this product, and so does my wife,need I say more. I can buy it from Wal-mart as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased a bottle of this about a week ago from my local Target store.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing :)&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after I bathe with it, I smell amazing and feel itchy :(</li>
    <li> This lotion feels so good and really adds moisture.</li>
    <li> keeps my skin hydrated. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> The smell is super masculine since it is so strong. I thought it would have a lighter smell like the organix shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;N/a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Too strong of a smell&lt;br /&gt;-Does not moisturize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product because it is useless. It does not hydrate your skin nor does it smell very good.</li>
    <li> this was a gift so really don&#x27;t know how she liked it.  I did give it a 4 star though.</li>
    <li> I works great on my body but not on my face. When applied to the face it has a burning effect and turns my face red.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  My skin has never been softer!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Smells great. Only thing is it does not keep my skin hydrated all day long. Was hoping it would. However, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I tried the shampoo and conditioner and loved the way my hair felt.I saw the wash and lotion here on Amazon (They do have EVERYTHING!!) and immediately got it.The lotion arrived and I have used it.It makes my skin feel soft and silky.My husband -who is NOT a lotion person-tried it because the heat in the house was drying out his skin-LOved it!!! He says its not sticky and tacky and he likes the soft scent.Yes,there is a sheen once you apply it-but after it dries-I don&#x27;t see it on my fair skin.I love the argon oil and the products that has it in them.I have tried the bottle of the Argon oil for hair by Organix and love it as well.Not greasy or oily in my thin fair hair! You need to try these products.You will love the way your hair and skin feels.</li>
    <li> I love Organix Argan oil lotion. It smells fabulous and really soaks in. I had tried the conditioner originally and then found this at Walmart (and it was much cheaper than priced on here). I have found alot of products on Amazon that I have trouble finding elsewhere. Just wish it were cheaper and in multiples..</li>
    <li> Its alright, I mean I thought I would get more hydration and more of a &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor considering it is argan oil. But it actually either left me feeling itchy or dry. It didn&#x27;t work near as well as my lotions I bought at the store for half the price. I gave it 2 extra stars because quite honestly I love the smell!!</li>
    <li> too expansive I found it at walmart  for $5.95</li>
    <li> It is absorbed easily and has a pleasant fragrance.  Best lotion I have used, and I would recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazingly thick and actually hydrates my skin. It smells so good but is not overpowering, so it doesnt compete with perfumes and body sprays. The packaging is also impressive for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth feeling with a great scent. Keeps skin hydrated for a at least 6-8 hours. I world recommend this to anyone who want a nice fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> Lovely bottle&lt;br /&gt;Appears to be good&lt;br /&gt;Quality  lotion&lt;br /&gt;But the smell is very similar to perfume&lt;br /&gt;And over powering&lt;br /&gt;Nothing I&#x27;d buy again</li>
    <li> This smells very nice and is thick but not greasy--kind of hard to squeeze out,  but worth the money.  It is moisturizing and,  I believe,  more so than most drugstore brands.  I bought it on Amazon because I didn&#x27;t find it at Wal Mart,  where I usually pick up body lotion.  I hope I can get the rest out of the bottle,  as it is quite a bit more money than I usually pay.</li>
    <li> I mix this lotion with argan oil and it&#x27;s just awesome,it&#x27;s awesome without the argan oil too,(I&#x27;m just a REAL believer in argan oil cuz it cured my cronic dry skin on my hands.)The organix hydrating moroccon argan oil lotion smells as good as any really nice purfume!!! Absolutly GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I first used the product because my friend had it.  I love the smell and the richness of the oil.  It absorbs quickly and makes the skin softer instantly.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this body lotion since i love the hair products from their line. It didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin well, just some. I didn&#x27;t want to waste it so I added coconut oil (you can get from any grocery store, mineral oil and baby oil and vitamin e) and put it on at night. I have very dry skin and am still looking for a good moisturizer for body. Really not that great.</li>
    <li> Good for dry indoor winter skin</li>
    <li> Product last a very long time, penetrates and hydrates skin. A little goes a long way. Definitely purchase this. You will see a true difference in your skin. Works well for all skin types.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Keeps my hands smooth!</li>
    <li> According to an April 30, 2103 article in the Wall Street Journal (see link below):&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Organix has a problem. It&#x27;s not organic.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, why is this product called \\&quot;Moroccan Argan Oil\\&quot; if it is an \\&quot;oil blend\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;It does not look like Argan Oil is its main ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE as of August 30, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;Litigation against Organix brand sends off warning signal - expert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A California class action lawsuit against Vogue International&#x27;s Organix brand could prove worrying for cosmetic brand holders, warns a law expert specializes in the cosmetics field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feels so smooth</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion before and LOVE it!! It has a nice, mild scent, and it REALLY moisturizes without being greasy. I just finished my first bottle of this, and I intend to keep using it as long as it is available. I bought another before my first one was out, so I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. All the products from Organix that I have bought are wonderful. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I WILL BUY THIS FOREVER. And you get a little shimmer and smell fab!</li>
    <li> feels great and helps my very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;smells good too husband loves the way my skin feels after I use it</li>
    <li> This product does leave your skin soft and there is not oily feel to it.  Less expensive than many of the other products out there too!</li>
    <li> I have this unhealthy obsession with Organix (now known as OGX). I recommend everything. I have sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t use many products. I&#x27;m also very picky about how things feel on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too liquidy. Not too thick. Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m coated in wax like with some other products. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash. A little goes a long way. Nice fragrance which isn&#x27;t overpowering &amp; so on &amp; so forth with the compliments. Makes me feel like silk &amp; I love it.</li>
    <li> Best body wash in the world! Don&#x27;t even need lotion after washing with this.</li>
    <li> This smells ok an works...but not having a pump is annoying. An I find myself bottle fumbling.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and the smell! I have bought this item multiple times and will continue to do so in the future!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite winter lotion, so much to the point that I just feel like hoarding it in fears that it could be discontinued one day (it&#x27;s kind of hard to find in the stores and when you do it&#x27;s very pricey). The smell of this product is absolutely delicious, not fruity and not too sweet...just something really good that I can&#x27;t put my finger on. In case you don&#x27;t love it, it fades somewhat quickly. But these aren&#x27;t the reasons that I love this lotion....I love it because it gives the hydration of a heavy body butter and lasts all day but has the consistency of a body lotion. The lasting power is the most impressive point and my skin is somewhat dry, especially during a cold winter. I have also noticed that since using this lotion any bumps on elbows or behind leg have completely disappeared (no recommended body was has done this for me). My skin is noticeably healthier and almost glowing, it never gets tight or itchy. Also, a little bit goes a long way because it glides on the skin well. A 13oz bottle has lasted me 2 months already and I am not even close to done with it. I use it on a daily basis and I use it generously. I&#x27;m not sure if this would be too heavy in summer months, but it&#x27;s great so far.  I really have nothing bad to say about this lotion and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting more.... more scent, creamier, richer, but it&#x27;s not bad, nothing offensive. Would probably buy again unless I found something better.</li>
