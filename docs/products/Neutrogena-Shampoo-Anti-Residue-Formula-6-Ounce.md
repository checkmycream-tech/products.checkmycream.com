      <li>Nice to be able to buy in bulk and save some money.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>

      <li>A+  :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Neutrogena anti-residue shampoo gets that pollution out of our hair,  and that&#x27;s why I use it,  to keep my hair, and keep it healthy.</li>
      <li>What more could you want in a shampoo?</li>
      <li>Our favorite shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It deserves more than 5 stars.</li>
      <li>one of my favorites and love the fragrance</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this literally for decades, absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>More than ever our environment is becoming more and more polluted with particulates floating in the air we can&#x27;t see,  but our hair absorbs plenty of this pollution every day, and eventually it will kill our hair follicle and we become bald headed or have patches of hair loss because of this pollution.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also great if you&#x27;re looking for a thorough cleansing, would suggest you to use it preferably once a week for squeeky clean hair, for those who don&#x27;t apply much of styling products on their hair often.</li>
      <li>More importantly to me</li>
      <li>Great product for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Use to be good, but smells far to strong now!  </li>
      <li>Cleans your hair perfectly and let it ready to make a professional treatment.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and shows oil really easily</li>
      <li>And would someone PLEASE recommend a healthy, gentle clarifying shampoo if you&#x27;ve had good success?</li>
      <li>This stuff leaves my hair so clean and light, I love it.</li>
      <li>Although, when I could find it rarely, their prices were better.  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena anti-residue shampoo smells very light, fresh, and clean, but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Love the clean fresh smell and my hair feels clean.</li>
      <li>You need to make sure you use good quality shampoo and conditioner afterwards otherwise your hair can become dry and oily.  </li>
      <li>Because I use a lot of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on my hair, I need a shampoo which removes build-up leaving a clean slate.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a once a week shampoo to really clean your hair of build-up you&#x27;ve accumulated over the week.</li>
      <li>I find this product to be just what I need to really clean my hair.</li>
      <li>and it keeps the buildup off my hair, leaving it clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>Hair is squeaky clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>If keeping your hair folicles clean has anything to do with helping your hair stay in there during those stages of life where Men do lose hair (stabilze after your 30&#x27;s and start again</li>
      <li>I can wash their hair with this shampoo and their hair smells clean for days.</li>
      <li>Cannot beat Neutrogena for clean feel and smell.</li>
      <li>Good for people who style their hair regularly.</li>
      <li>and my hair is very silky and ready for more &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; :)</li>
      <li>Although its scent is quite strong but I love this smell, do not use it if you have got extremely sensitive scalp or allergy.</li>
      <li>It might sound funny</li>
      <li>However, the convenience and NOT having to fight traffic, going out scouring around for it is worth buying it here online and from Amazon LLC.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s worth 10 stars.</li>
      <li>This product really does produce squeaky clean hair.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful shampoo that will remove residue from other shampoos, as well as excess oils from your hair, without making your scalp dry and itchy!</li>
      <li>It has become hard to find in stores, so we are happy to see it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>(there was more than one vendor with different prices and shipping costs</li>
      <li>It takes out all the residue from the products you use on a consistent basis.</li>
      <li>then that might be logical.    </li>
      <li>also really like the way my hair smells afterwards!</li>
      <li>Cleans well--not too harsh and smells good too.</li>
      <li>Cleans VERY well, and you don&#x27;t need to use very much at all.  </li>
      <li>A pure shampoo with no added perfumes or thickeners, it cleans without harmful additives</li>
      <li>I received this as a free product from BzzAgent to try and was pleasantly surprised at how soft and silky my hair was after trying it.</li>
      <li>I have very normal hair</li>
      <li>If you are familiar with other Neutrogena products, it has that same smell to it, which I love.</li>
      <li>Use this once a week and your other shampoos and hair products will work better.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this shampoo for the whole family.</li>
      <li>I recently received this product from Neutrogena to try for free and have used it about a dozen times so far.</li>
      <li>However, I thought this would be a great price until I found the same thing at my local CVS and 3 bottles, same size, would actually have been cheaper by $ 2-3 dollars.</li>
      <li>Does as normal cleansing shampoo</li>
      <li>My hair STILL looks like a greasy mess that I haven&#x27;t been able to completely clear</li>
      <li>No better shampoo to get hair really squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>I spent $20 on the 3-pack because I trusted the Neutrogena name to be GOOD for my skin/hair, and I can&#x27;t spend my hard-earned money again on a harsh, damaging product like this one.</li>
      <li>i have very sensitive scalp</li>
      <li>I am not usually that picky about shampoo, but I like this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Removes old residue from other hair products and clean scalp.  </li>
      <li>I only wish Neutrogena still made it in the large pump bottles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Steer clear of this &amp;#34;anti-residue formula&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>so I think it is not intended for sensitive scalp or scalp that may have irritation,broken skin, or eczema.</li>
      <li>but so far this is something I would buy for myself.  </li>
      <li>The volume, the shine, and overall appearance of my hair is worth the extra effort.</li>
      <li>The scent is lovely, and with continued use, my thin hair is much thicker.  </li>
      <li>It has a slight sweet smell, but it&#x27;s not perfume, and it is not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>and have been told that is an easy color to fade quickly with the wrong shampoos.  </li>
      <li>When I looked it up on the &#x27;Skin Deep&#x27; website I found it to be highly allergenic, which explains my cough and burning eyes.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and my hair (which is very fine and thin) appears thicker.</li>
      <li>And I have red hair naturally (and chemically!)</li>
      <li>even Costco with future razor purchases not tied directly to the shampoo.</li>
      <li>so have to use this daily and love the feeling of clean hair before i use my other shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip all mess but rather adds a thin layer of whatever it supposed to add</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best ! Used for 15 years or so now !</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it is an excellent product, and makes my hair feel amazing.  Because it is a anti-residue shampoo it can make it somewhat extremely dry, but after a few days there is a vast improvement in my hair.  I have very normal hair and I&#x27;ve never colored it.  I would recommend this product to anyone!!!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Does as normal cleansing shampoo</li>
    <li> Hair is squeaky clean and shiny. Use this once a week and your other shampoos and hair products will work better. It takes out all the residue from the products you use on a consistent basis.</li>
    <li> what can I say it is Neutrogena  A+  :)</li>
    <li> I have had a terrible, kind of an annoying time finding this exact shampoo any more in stores like Target, Wal-Mart, etc...  Although, when I could find it rarely, their prices were better.  However, the convenience and NOT having to fight traffic, going out scouring around for it is worth buying it here online and from Amazon LLC.  What else is there?  A great product as always, great Amazon service and reasonably fair prices with FAST PRIME 2 day shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use regularly to get my oily hair under control and it did wonders in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product from Neutrogena to try for free and have used it about a dozen times so far. If you are familiar with other Neutrogena products, it has that same smell to it, which I love. The thing about this shampoo is that you don&#x27;t use it every day. It&#x27;s a once a week shampoo to really clean your hair of build-up you&#x27;ve accumulated over the week. I don&#x27;t use a lot of hair products, so my hair never feels weighed down. But, I do work in my garden a lot and am usually covered in dirt and pollen after a long day outside. I find this product to be just what I need to really clean my hair. I even secretly look forward to that Neutrogena smell! It&#x27;s a little more expensive than a typical shampoo, but as it&#x27;s for occasional use, I like to look at it like a treat for my hair.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the results after using it. The product does remove residue from other products that lingers after use.</li>
    <li> A pure shampoo with no added perfumes or thickeners, it cleans without harmful additives</li>
    <li> I received this as a free product from BzzAgent to try and was pleasantly surprised at how soft and silky my hair was after trying it. I have only used it a few times so I can&#x27;t speak yet and the long term effects but so far this is something I would buy for myself.  You need to make sure you use good quality shampoo and conditioner afterwards otherwise your hair can become dry and oily.  The volume, the shine, and overall appearance of my hair is worth the extra effort.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to use this shampoo every day to get great results.  I use it about twice a week and it keeps the buildup off my hair, leaving it clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena anti-residue shampoo smells very light, fresh, and clean, but not overpowering.  Cleans VERY well, and you don&#x27;t need to use very much at all.  It is being discontinued at some stores, so the deals on here for Amazon Prime are terrific deals.  Highly recommend this shampoo for the whole family.</li>
    <li> Love the clean fresh smell and my hair feels clean.</li>
    <li> Because I use a lot of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on my hair, I need a shampoo which removes build-up leaving a clean slate.  I use Neutrogena, Anti-Residue at least once a week. It takes very little to do the job well, but I always buy in packs of 3.  Amazon has the best price of which I am aware.</li>
    <li> good product. really deep cleans hair. I use this every few shampoos to remove the build up of less expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena does not irritate my skin.  Great product for people with sensitive skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and my hair (which is very fine and thin) appears thicker.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has been a family favorite for years!  It is great for removing buildup and keeping hair healthy.  It has become hard to find in stores, so we are happy to see it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to use Bumble &amp; Bumble Sunday shampoo for clarifying/anti-residue needs.  To save money, I tried out Neutrogena&#x27;s product.  It works great at a fraction of the cost.  I&#x27;ll be using Neutrogena&#x27;s anti-residue shampoo instead of B&amp;B Sunday.</li>
    <li> More than ever our environment is becoming more and more polluted with particulates floating in the air we can&#x27;t see,  but our hair absorbs plenty of this pollution every day, and eventually it will kill our hair follicle and we become bald headed or have patches of hair loss because of this pollution.&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena anti-residue shampoo gets that pollution out of our hair,  and that&#x27;s why I use it,  to keep my hair, and keep it healthy.</li>
    <li> No better shampoo to get hair really squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> Item was received as description, prompt delivery</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great and leaves your hair feeling very clean and shiny.  Removes old residue from other hair products and clean scalp.  HOWEVER, my teenage grandson tried it and he has an itchy scalp and the shampoo burned, so I think it is not intended for sensitive scalp or scalp that may have irritation,broken skin, or eczema.</li>
    <li> Use to be good, but smells far to strong now!  To drying I have no idea what they changed but it made it awful.  Not a good thing.</li>
    <li> Have used this shampoo on a weekly basis for year, have always been pleased with the quality.  Nice to be able to buy in bulk and save some money.  Good product, good value.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Cleans your hair perfectly and let it ready to make a professional treatment. It deserves more than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> using gel? mouse? wax? oil? any other hair products? well i do and all other shampoos wont clean my hair from the mess i put onto them, this shampoo definitely removes all residues and days and sometimes weeks of hair products in one simple wash without drying my scalp out. i have very sensitive scalp so have to use this daily and love the feeling of clean hair before i use my other shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip all mess but rather adds a thin layer of whatever it supposed to add</li>
    <li> There are times i need to use aquaphor on my face or neosporin.  It inevitably gets in my hair and regular shampoo can&#x27;t get it out, but this shampoo DOES.  My hair is fine and shows oil really easily so I use this once a week to keep the oiliness at bay - just don&#x27;t forget to condition afterwards or you will be dealing with some crazy knots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the way my hair smells afterwards!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years now.  It smells great and does a great job.  WalMart cannot match this price when bought in the three pack.  It&#x27;s a good deal.  You will be please with this product.</li>
    <li> I followed the once-a-week directions for use, but after the second use my hair/scalp was SO stripped of oils/moisture that my scalp was in shock and started working overtime to produce oils to try to correct the terrible imbalance caused by the shampoo. I didn&#x27;t make the connection until I started researching causes of such a sudden, massive production of oil on the scalp. My hair STILL looks like a greasy mess that I haven&#x27;t been able to completely clear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steer clear of this &amp;#34;anti-residue formula&amp;#34;. And would someone PLEASE recommend a healthy, gentle clarifying shampoo if you&#x27;ve had good success? I spent $20 on the 3-pack because I trusted the Neutrogena name to be GOOD for my skin/hair, and I can&#x27;t spend my hard-earned money again on a harsh, damaging product like this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for cleaning kids hair.  I can wash their hair with this shampoo and their hair smells clean for days. That&#x27;s worth 10 stars.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, good price &amp; delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over 15 years ever day.  I&#x27;m a 46 year-old man with a basic middle of the road hair cut that anyone would have in an office.    It might sound funny but I feel it might have stopped or reduced the amount of hair-loss I had at the time I started using it.  If keeping your hair folicles clean has anything to do with helping your hair stay in there during those stages of life where Men do lose hair (stabilze after your 30&#x27;s and start again I guess in your late 60&#x27;s?) then that might be logical.    Anyway you slice it, my head feels cleaner when I use it.  I ran out and couldn&#x27;t find it in my stores and looked online as a last resort.  I felt dirty the week I had to use different shampoo&#x27;s... even the replacement Neutregena one in the stores(had a conditioning element i guees).  It ended up being cheaper to buy it here (there was more than one vendor with different prices and shipping costs.. find the one that works best for the quantity you&#x27;d like)    With sales tax close to 10% in my area, that pushes things in favor of buying them from Amazon too.    I think I&#x27;ll look into savign money buying Razors etc online now too due to Neutregena not pushing Stores too carry it or the stores eliminating it.  Thats going to cost them money...even Costco with future razor purchases not tied directly to the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it works great.  I use it once a week or as necessary.  It was delivered on time at a great price.</li>
    <li> Always use this to get the buildup out of my hair. Is a bit drying, so I do use extra conditioner after.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Period. This stuff leaves my hair so clean and light, I love it.</li>
    <li> I do like this shampoo quite a bit! However, I thought this would be a great price until I found the same thing at my local CVS and 3 bottles, same size, would actually have been cheaper by $ 2-3 dollars.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a terrible &#x27;Neutrogena&#x27; odor that permeated my hair and took three washings and a dose of vinegar to remove.  When I looked it up on the &#x27;Skin Deep&#x27; website I found it to be highly allergenic, which explains my cough and burning eyes.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Cannot beat Neutrogena for clean feel and smell.</li>
    <li> The scent is lovely, and with continued use, my thin hair is much thicker.  I passed on this information to other older women friends and they&#x27;re finding the same thing!</li>
    <li> Leaves no residue, works into a great lather, gets all product out of your hair, protects color treated hair and doesn&#x27;t fade color. What more could you want in a shampoo?</li>
    <li> I use a lot of hair products and can get quite a build up.  Using this once a week gets that all out and my hair is very silky and ready for more &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in a store anywhere.  I am not usually that picky about shampoo, but I like this stuff.  Not much odor.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  Just cleans your hair.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo that will remove residue from other shampoos, as well as excess oils from your hair, without making your scalp dry and itchy! I dye my hair, and this shampoo DOES NOT damage the dye.  And I have red hair naturally (and chemically!) and have been told that is an easy color to fade quickly with the wrong shampoos.  This actually keeps my hair hydrated without drying it out, yet it makes my hair fluffier and fuller.  I love it.  If you have allergies or sensitivities to many things, as I do, you will have a much better chance of NO issues with this shampoo.  It has a slight sweet smell, but it&#x27;s not perfume, and it is not overpowering.  More importantly to me, it does NOT make my hairline or skin itch afterwards, as a lot of shampoos do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this literally for decades, absolutely love it. I only wish Neutrogena still made it in the large pump bottles.</li>
    <li> Although its scent is quite strong but I love this smell, do not use it if you have got extremely sensitive scalp or allergy. Works for everyone, help to reduce and refresh your hair.</li>
    <li> This is a staple. The bottle lasts forever it&#x27;s not used for every shampoo. This product really does produce squeaky clean hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for getting the buildup off your hair from product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has always been great for me to get rid of styling products thoroughly and is easy on the hair, plus I love the scent. The 3-pack was a bargain too.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo I use.</li>
    <li> Good for people who style their hair regularly. Also great if you&#x27;re looking for a thorough cleansing, would suggest you to use it preferably once a week for squeeky clean hair, for those who don&#x27;t apply much of styling products on their hair often.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too bad that it is discontinued because the price just went up too much for me to keep using it,</li>
    <li> Our favorite shampoo.  Cleans well--not too harsh and smells good too.</li>
    <li> one of my favorites and love the fragrance</li>
