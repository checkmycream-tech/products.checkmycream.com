      <li>so I thought this would be great too</li>
      <li>Another great product I won&#x27;t be without.</li>
      <li>I love what it does for my hair!!</li>
      <li>One of my favorite products!  </li>
      <li>So glad I found this!</li>
      <li>It seems to do an okay job.</li>
      <li>so along with it, I have to apply Argan oil; otherwise I would never be able to brush or comb my hair.</li>
      <li>but reviews said it was terrific and the best.....</li>
      <li>Love my Aloxxi conditioner</li>
      <li>My hair is baby fine.</li>
      <li>So my advice is to have argan or another oil available to smooth your hair AFTER using the serum.</li>
      <li>I paid considerably more than Amazon&#x27;s price at my hairdressers, but worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Aloxxi Style Thickening Serum is wonderful for my fine and thin hair.  </li>
      <li>The thickening serum REALLY does make it look thicker!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight yet powerful.  </li>
      <li>So using the Aloxxi serum alone makes my hair stick out like a cloud, a kind of DRY cloud.</li>
      <li>She likes it very much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and light.  </li>
      <li>Does seems to help my very fine, straight hair keep volume when I blow dry it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with extra fine hair all my life.</li>
      <li>Yes it works especially for fine curly hair.</li>
      <li>I asked my sister to try it on her straight thicker hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Really 3 1/2 stars</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t  see much difference.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair full body and texture especially towards the tips of the hair.</li>
      <li>My hair feels thicker with just a small amount &amp; better held my hair in place.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I have fine, limp hair.</li>
      <li>Whilst it gave her hair more texture it also weigh down her long hair making her look like she had a flat hair day.</li>
      <li>Really works and it leaves hair soft not with that straw-like feel of other volumizers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was not worth the trouble I had to go to be able to buy it.</li>
      <li>I have very thin , fine, straight hair.</li>

    <li> Does seems to help my very fine, straight hair keep volume when I blow dry it.</li>
    <li> Yes it works especially for fine curly hair. It gives my hair full body and texture especially towards the tips of the hair. I asked my sister to try it on her straight thicker hair. It gave her a somewhat different outcome. Whilst it gave her hair more texture it also weigh down her long hair making her look like she had a flat hair day.</li>
    <li> i  like it but reviews said it was terrific and the best..... ummm</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products!  Makes my hair feel thicker.  It&#x27;s soft and light.  Never feels heavy or stiff in my  hair</li>
    <li> Really works and it leaves hair soft not with that straw-like feel of other volumizers.</li>
    <li> It seems to do an okay job. It does make the hair shaft feel thicker without stiffness. If you live in Florida I guess you have to realize nothing will hold all day without being stiff. Humidity is not friendly to hairdos.</li>
    <li> This serum is the answer to my prayers.  I&#x27;ve struggled with extra fine hair all my life. I&#x27;m 66 and wear my hair short.  Two or three squirts worked through my hair give it lift like I&#x27;ve never had without looking like I&#x27;ve used gel.  It&#x27;s lightweight yet powerful.  I paid considerably more than Amazon&#x27;s price at my hairdressers, but worth every penny.  Because it takes so little, I expect it to last quite a while.</li>
    <li> It did not help to thicken my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  Love my Aloxxi conditioner so I thought this would be great too but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My hair feels thicker with just a small amount &amp; better held my hair in place.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this! I love what it does for my hair!!</li>
    <li> Aloxxi Style Thickening Serum is wonderful for my fine and thin hair.  The style will stay in all day even in wind.</li>
    <li> did not like the texture</li>
    <li> Used by wife. She likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Another great product I won&#x27;t be without.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have fine, limp hair. It made my hair baby-fine, and flatter than ever.</li>
    <li> The reason for a 4 rating--it seemed to make my hair a little oily.</li>
    <li> I have very thin , fine, straight hair. I am always looking for anything to help give me a little volume, or density. I tried this, and it just didn&#x27;t do anything!! In fact, it made my hair even silkier, and with less body.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> My hair is baby fine. I don&#x27;t  see much difference.</li>
    <li> The serum alone, does not provide any volume or structure nor shine. It is more expensive, compared with other products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;It was not worth the trouble I had to go to be able to buy it.</li>
    <li> Really 3 1/2 stars but I don&#x27;t know how to make a half-star!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been falling out and very dry for the last couple months because of illness, so I wanted something to make it look thicker. The thickening serum REALLY does make it look thicker!! However, it also seems to dry out my hair, so along with it, I have to apply Argan oil; otherwise I would never be able to brush or comb my hair. As I mentioned, my hair is already dry, so I don&#x27;t like something drying it out further! I let my hair air-dry. So using the Aloxxi serum alone makes my hair stick out like a cloud, a kind of DRY cloud. So my advice is to have argan or another oil available to smooth your hair AFTER using the serum.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It does not leave my hair sticky or weighed down like other serums can.  I like the way it makes my hair look.</li>
