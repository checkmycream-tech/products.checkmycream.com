<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Looks like I am one of the unlucky few who experienced the opposite of what this shampoo is supposed to do. The first couple of times I used it, I lost significantly more hair during my shower than I have using different shampoos. I stopped using it, but decided to give it another shot after a month. Used it 3 more times, and each time, the same thing happened. Significantly more hair loss than when I am not using it. Pretty disappointed, given that this is not a cheap shampoo and it lead to very different results from what it claims.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have been using for years,</li>
    <li> Love this product. Saw results after first conditioning.. My hair is silky soft and fuller :)</li>
    <li> I bought this couple of weeks ago, makes your hair feel soft and cleans the scalp well. I like it and would recommend it. I do feel it has helped in hair growth as well even though its a slow process.</li>
    <li> Feels like I have super glue on my scalp, extremely drying.  Conditioners I&#x27;ve used can&#x27;t overpower the drying effect caused by this shampoo.  Anyone with hair loss knowledge knows dry scalp is a big no-no as it contributes to hair loss.  Yes, the shampoo may have some ingredients that could potentially help retain your hair (keep in mind there is no credible evidence to support these claims) but given its drying effect the net effect is certainly negative.  I personally could of had the same effect using dishwasher soap, no good.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, Leave my hair really clean,and somehow add volume, hair is like more puffy</li>
    <li> On my second bottle, absolutely love this shampoo. My hair completely stopped falling out right away! and it is begging to thicken !</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best! It not only helps preserve your hair, but it also gives it volume and shine. Definitely use the conditioner with it!</li>
    <li> Normally I have to wash my hair every day or sometimes even every 12 hours to keep it from being oily......:( Now, after use this product for one month, I think I can keep my hair clean for 36 hours. That is a encouraging start.</li>
    <li> After several uses, it seems working...the scent is mild and nice. Not much bubbles so you need to apply a bit more than usual. Most of the shampoo tends to cause hair loss but not to prevent, but this one caused less hair loss after the wash. The scalp does not feel the sting or itchy. For people has trouble with hair loss, definitely would recommend to try.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle last month and I loved it. I have ordered two more from amazon.</li>
    <li> Only used a couple times seems pretty good, we will see if it helps at all with the hair loss. Do love that it&#x27;s organic, unfortunately not a fan of their conditioner, as I know it is not ment for hair loss it is causing me more as my hair is still in knots after using :-(</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for almost two weeks and I surprisingly found that the I grew some soft hair!! The hair looks more dense! When I wash my hair with this shampoo, it prevents the loss as well. I will keep using it and hopefully it can also help you to improve the quality of the hair!</li>
    <li> I use this organic shampoo for almost half a year. The initial idea is to explore the shampoo outside of brand name ones, and organic sounds right to do. Compared to brand name shampoo, this organic one feels less oily on my hair after using it for 18~20hr. Hair loss condition maintains the same level as before ( hard to quantify exactly).  I&#x27;ll continue to try and probably come back with some updates.</li>
    <li> After two weeks use, I got less hair loss. My hair feels clean, soft. I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Opinions seem to vary on this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and am already experiencing noticeably less hair loss. I will update after finishing my first bottle. Overall recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Worried about my hair loss, so I bought this shampoo! I like it a lot. I&#x27;ve gotten comments that my hair looks healthier! Also, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have a lot of product in my hair the way other shampoos do.</li>
    <li> When it comes to hair loss prevention shampoo I am always scared of how this would leave my hair. I used John Frieda Frizz easy Shampoo + conditioner for the past 3 year and added a minoxidil 5% drops solution after every shower. The result for my hair was sticky, I felt drowsy in the mornings and happened to experience shortness of breath: no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this bottle just to give a try to all the good reviews on amazon. I know that Argan Oil is really good for the hair so I said why not. It is the 3rd morning I am using this shampoo and my hair looks and feels stronger. I used the conditioner after the shampoo the first time, although I realized that it is not necessary, my hair are just great with the shampoo only! So what is happening now is that I am using 1 product instead of 3! Hopefully this will prevent the hair loss as supposed, I will update this review in a month and see what happens!</li>
    <li> The Pura D&#x27;or blue is not as good as the Gold Premium version I have found. The blue caused severe irritation and didnt seem to arrest the symptoms as described on the Pura D&#x27;or website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to purchase this directly from Pura D&#x27;or. However I was informed they could not ship it to my location unless I paid them via a money wire transfer rather than via paypal. At that stage I had already paid and they ended up refunding my money are one week of emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person that answers the emails on their website is also pretty rude I have to say.</li>
    <li> Amazing and works just as decribed</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I was looking for a product that would prevent hair loss rather than re-growth.  Upon the recommendation of my friend, I  have used it for a month and found it helpful. Unlike some of the other shampoos I had tried in the past, it has better ingredients and a great citrus smell and it leaves my hair looking and feeling healthy. Hair is looking much more soft and thicker and not as dry and limp anymore. Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep the hair healthy and in place.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair pretty dry and more hair loss is observed in the shower and during the day after dried. Kind of defeat the purpose.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it feels good when using it and it does not dry the hair as other shampoos. I don&#x27;t know about all their claims about stop shedding hair with all those additional ingredients. We will see.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the consistency, the feeling of the product &amp; the smell of it&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed &amp; dissatisfied</li>
    <li> I find this as a really good shampoo without any harmful chemicals like most leading brands. I have been using it since a week now and I personally find it excellent for daily use. You might want to use a conditioner along with this shampoo because it leaves my skin a bit dry. I am quite satisfied and happy, except that its a bit pricey. I will have to see how it works out in coming months; but I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo feels and smells great. Just a small pump covers my full head of hair and its lathers up thick. My hair has just started to thin and I&#x27;m using this as prevention. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and its hard to tell a difference in such a short period of time, but I think its starting to slow down the hair loss. I plan to use this as part of my regiment with other herbal remedies.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for 6 months now and have definitely see less hair loss.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t confirm the long term affects but it certainly makes my hair feel and look much fuller and voluminous. When I use regular shampoo for one day I notice how limp it seems in comparison.  My only tip would be to purchase the conditioner as well. It causes my hair to be a bit more tangled than normal.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product :D. I tried some caffeine based shampoo with no result. This one is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Happy with this shampoo. I have sensitive skin that itches easy and recently stopped using shampoo as a result. A few weeks ago, my homeopath doc recommended trying a shampoo with Biotin in it. So I searched the web &amp; Amazon and bought Pura d&#x27;or based on the quality &amp; quantity of positive reviews. Although I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, so far I&#x27;m really happy with this shampoo. My hair feels soft and my skin/scalp isn&#x27;t itching. I&#x27;ll update this review as I go along.</li>
    <li> works great, love the results</li>
    <li> Used this product for the first time today and noticed a difference in hair volume already. Made my scalp feel nice and clean and loved the smell of tea tree oil. Excited to see if it will help with my hair loss. The only con I can think of is I had to use quite a bit to get it to lather.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pretty great. The first time I used it, it looked like I was shedding tons of hair but after that first try, I have been noticeably losing less. My boyfriend loves it too!</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel but mostly I use it because I don&#x27;t seem to lose as much hair when I use this all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I ran out and bought another Argan Oil Shampoo from the local store then I REALLY knew how much I liked the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo. So luckily I have amazon Prime and got another bottle fast!  I also feel it does not fade my hair as much as other shampoos I have used.</li>
    <li> My brother-in-law, who has noticeably been balding over the last few years, tried this product after tirelessly trying so many others and was so happy and relieved with the result. He says, \\&quot;As I have hair loss, I am very careful on what I use on my hair. It has noticeable reduced my hair loss and has strengthen my existing hair. This made an immediate impact. I started see baby hair on my scalp. This is an expensive shampoo, no doubt about it but it is worth it. Combine this with Biotin and you are good to go.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is a very good shampoo. I was looking for something with organic ingredients that would work well for me. Although i am older i didn&#x27;t really need the loss prevention but i guess it can&#x27;t hurt. Shampoo leaves my hair soft, like i had used a conditioner. Great stuff, i will continue to purchase. My wife is going to begin using when her present shampoo is gone.  Jim R.</li>
    <li> Not working for me :(</li>
    <li> Thank you for this shampoo! I had been experiencing an itchy  rash on my neck from my previously loves shampoo and needed to try something more natural and thought that the hair loss prevention would be an added bonus for my thinning hair. I just decided to go on Amazon and start browsing the natural color care shampoos. Right away I noticed that the itchiness on my neck calmed down and my hair felt very clean and soft after use. It lathers well unlike my other color care shampoo as well! It also seems fuller and thicker. I will continue to purchase this great shampoo - glad I found it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It makes my hair clean and shiny and gives it volume too. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, so not sure how well it is at hair loss prevention, but I like it and I will continue using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> it smells nature.but it&#x27;s cleaning function can be improved.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The scent is refreshing and calming. I require very little product to wash my hair and results are a clean-soft texture. I have not noticed any hair regeneration but I have not lost any hair since using Pura d or with argon oil. As an added benefit I use Pura d or on my body as well and I have noticed that blemishes cleared up on my body. I tried other products but did not get the same results. Also, my order was relieved the next day.</li>
    <li> Good product ! Received it recently but impressed with packaging and smell and feels good to use an honest product.</li>
    <li> really increases hair volume...plan to buy two more bottles</li>
    <li> Definitely have seen a decrease in hair loss. will continue using!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality shampoo. Felt my hair thicken after first 2 uses, smells great as well.</li>
    <li> I am 26 and was worried about baldness when my hair started shedding so heard about this product from a Friend and used it and this sh** works.</li>
    <li> Works! I&#x27;m telling you this stuff is like magical hair growing shampoo! Definitely buying more when I run out!</li>
    <li> All natural product. Leaves hair feeling clean. 16 oz is actually pretty good considering the price. One pump is enough. Hoping continued use will prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Love it so much and its really benefited my hair. Ill definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Used for two weeks now. Good so far</li>
    <li> Packing in good condition, it was a great product!</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo after I started loosing my hair due to a critical illness. I tried dozens of hair products, processes and treatments, I found nothing worked. I actually first came across this product on a groupon and decided to give it a try. Immediately I noticed that my hair was thicker, fuller, longer and healthy looking. My hair has never looked better. I have given samples to my closest family and friends, all who found similar results. I use this product exclusively.</li>
    <li> Heard great things about the product so I had to give it a try.  Just started but So far so good.  Will keep everyone posted.  Shipping was great.  Got it within 2 days.</li>
    <li> Great Product!! It works well with my hair. Will buy another one soon!</li>
    <li> I needed a shampoo for everday use which wouldn&#x27;t hurt my scalp and hair with extra chemicals.  I also was looking to promote hair growth and scalp moisturization but at the same time keep my hair volumized (great for all those guys with thinning hair).  Going forward this is my go to shampoo and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought them for my mom and she loves them so much that I have to buy them for her every month. She tried too many products before even with baby shampoo. None of them works until this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple of years and have really liked it. I placed a recent order when my last bottle was running low. When I switched over to the new bottle I couldn&#x27;t get the shampoo out of the pump. At first I thought it was a pump issue, but soon realized that the shampoo itself was the culprit. I can only describe the consistency of the shampoo in the most recent bottle I purchased as thick snot. It&#x27;s so thick that it won&#x27;t come out of the pump and doesn&#x27;t lather at all. Usually this shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much, but the last bottle was unusable. What the heck happened?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I passed the return date while I was using the remnants of my previous bottle, so now I&#x27;m stuck with unusable thick snot. Boooooo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month, and I feel that this shampoo has strengthen my hair and it greatly reduced my hair loss compared with last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product design is somewhat bad. It is hard to get the shampoo out from the bottle through the straw (I don&#x27;t know what it called), so I need to open the cap and pour it manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is great, but need some improvement on that bottle cap.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Would like to try the gold label shampoo and compare what the difference is.</li>
    <li> I moved to colorado in december 2013 from india. I started experiencing immense amount of hairfall in the initial days which added to my concern . Initially, I used shampoo which had caffeine and other chemicals in it. That did not help but made the matters worse. Then i read stuff about organic shampoo and bought one but it did not help me either. Then i read reviews about Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss shampoo and started using it . This product has given strength to my hair and has reduced the hairfall to an extent . It is bit pricey but worth everything you spend. I will continue to use this product in the future as well</li>
    <li> I love the product!! Perfect for me. Prevent my hair falling out.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working so far, hair feels much fuller and leaves a nice shine. Smells great and washes out clean.</li>
    <li> I had beed seeking for an organic shampoo which can effectively prevent hair loss. My friend recommended me to buy this product. I got it one month ago and would write the review for this product after at least one month. It is really good. It smells nice. I find I lose less hair than before. Hope new growth is coming.</li>
    <li> It works! I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months and it prevents my hair loss.. I will order this again..</li>
    <li> i have been using the shampoo with a laser comb for about 6 months. it works after a while you just have to give it a little bit of time and make sure you keep using it. the only down side is that if you stop using it you will see the hair loss start up again.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in this shampoo are great and it does give your hair a fuller look, however it does absolutely nothing to prevent hair loss. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and I&#x27;m still dealing with the same amount, if not more hair loss. FYI I&#x27;m a male with short-medium hair length. The shampoo itself is great, but since it&#x27;s touted as a &amp;#34;hair loss prevention&amp;#34; product it deserves the low rating as it does not live up to its title. Also, the company offers to send you a free bottle if you give them a positive review, (which is probably why the reviews are so positive). The free bottle I received had different font on the bottle and slightly different ingredients, also the actual shampoo was different in color, smell, and texture. I&#x27;m not sure if that has something to do with quality issues, but regardless it wasn&#x27;t comforting supposedly having two of the same product that were so different. Going to try another Argan Oil Shampoo that I saw on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure it works quite as well as claimed--any more than I can say why I need hair loss prevention shampoo in the first place (illness? hormones? age? genetics?). It feels good, it smells good, and I think it might be helping with hair fall.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helped with any regrowth of hair - which is not one of its claims, it has lessened the amount of loss.  Like others have said, it&#x27;s expensive - no getting around it but I will continue to purchase it since I&#x27;m seeing results.</li>
    <li> My friends recommend this item to me.It&#x27;s a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> Tried it for the first time and already seeing a different in the texture and shine of the hair.</li>
    <li> Product shipped quite quickly, been using it for just over a month now, seems to be a good product and gentle on the hair, just waiting to see results!</li>
    <li> I has been puzzled by losing my hair for a long time, especially when I am having bath. It is surprising that the drain of bath is still unblocked after I use Pura d&#x27;or shampoo for more than one week.</li>
    <li> Less Hair fall on the second week !.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo along with the conditioner for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;m beginning to see slight changes. The amount of hair that has been falling out is slowing down. I go to the gym consistently, so I tend to wash my hair everyday (I know this is bad for my hair) so it makes my scalp a little dry. Recently, I&#x27;ve been using it every other day at the most, which has helped a lot. I also take hair, skin, and nails vitamins along with fish oil. With the combination of the products, I have been seeing a large amount of hair growth. Overall, this product has been showing positive results!</li>
    <li> This product works very well for me! After using it for about 2 weeks, I have noticed less oil in my hair, also the hair loss problem is starting to improve. Previously my hair got very greasy if I did not wash it for 2 days and I also felt itchy on my head. I can see hair loss each time after I washed my hair. Although the price is much higher than other shampoo products, I think it is worth to buy, at least it exceeds my expectation. I hope my hair will get much better as I continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for almost a month now, it smells good, a small amount of the shampoo can produces a lot of foam and makes my hair really clean. I just used the shampoo without any conditioner, but my hair is shiny (I have oily hair), not dry at all. I have a sparse spot on top of my head. After I used the shampoo once a day, I noticed 1) I saw less hair in the shower tub  after I washed my hair 2) The sparse area seems to show less skin. 3) A few hairs grew out on my forehead in the area that used to have no hair. I haven&#x27;t tried to use the shampoo less or more frequently and see what the result is. I gave it four stars only because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the real result.</li>
    <li> I did notice my hair loss was less while using it, but my hair also got super dry and fussy. Once I stop using it, the hair loss problem is still there!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a very nice scent and leaves my hair clean feeling with tons of shine!  I do feel like it does aid in the prevention of hair loss, as I notice less hair in my hairbrush and my hair appears much healthier! I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 months and I already notice a difference in the health of my hair! I am now purchasing my 2nd bottle and I still have half of my first bottle so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I just used two times right now, but it is really good to fight against hair loss. great shampoo.</li>
    <li> not sure if it&#x27;s gonna help my hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks. It seems help hair loss prevention.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am extremely pleased with this shampoo. If you care about hair loss and volume you know how important it is to feel that after you washed your hair, it becomes thicker and makes the screechy noise. I had a shampoo for that in France and could not find it here in the US. I tried the US version of L&#x27;Oreal Men shampoo and it was completely different, and I started noticing a greater hair loss. After reading many reviews on amazon I decided to try this one, and I don&#x27;t regret it. I do realize that results vary from one person to another but I personally feel it works!&lt;br /&gt;BTW I am a man with long hair and I really care about it as it is part of my personality so this review is really honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;Or works just as I wish and I thank amazon for carrying this product!</li>
    <li> In the weeks I have been using this product, I have found significantly fewer hairs in the drain.  I have thick, curly, medium-length hair, which has started to thin as I age, which is why I bought this product.  It sure seems to be working!  Interestingly, I also have to use less than with Nioxin shampoo--the lather is great!  I also like the smell a lot--&amp; it doesn&#x27;t clash with other scents I might wea on my skin.  Yes, it is a bit pricier than some shampoos, but it is totally worth it, in my opinion--plus, the benefits of using it (along with not having to use as much), actually make it more cost effective than other options.</li>
    <li> From day one when i tried this product I noticed a true feel of a shampoo, nice and foamy and the final outcome when I finished with my shower was incredible , I like having my hair in a messy look since I do have hair loss problems and it worked great , it gave my hair a natural , moldable and healthy appearance. I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss prevention for a couple weeks and I can definitely can say my hair looks thicker and healthier and most importantly I don&#x27;t see that much hair falling and that&#x27;s great, I&#x27;m very happy with this product! :)</li>
    <li> Disappointed that the top was broken, making it difficult to dispense. Also the shampoo itself makes my scalp itch. Might just be me, but I&#x27;m still disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t a positive experience.  The scent of the shampoo is alright though.</li>
    <li> Ok so my hair has been shedding for a couple months a lot I went to the dermatologist for blood to be taken and my levels are very normal he told me it&#x27;s the birth control I&#x27;m on and to let my body adjust to it. My hair is very very long so one strand rolled up looks like 4 strands of hair so he said my shedding was normal. I didn&#x27;t think it was normal so I looked for a DHT blocker and so I read very good reviews and bought this. OMG I used one time and my hair sheds more! And no body. I mean I think this made my hair fall out more and my scalp is itchy burning idk why I never ever had that problem. I will NOT use this anymore I&#x27;m scared that if I continue to use it my hair will get too thin after reading these one star reviews now I know why. I should I read them before I bought this crap I really wanted this to work. Will be going back to my garlic shampoo cause that works.</li>
    <li> Quality shampoo, but the cost is high.  Never regrew any hair, but provides the good environment to grow hair.</li>
    <li> I firstly did not really believe that it could actually help my hair grow back. My expectation was to prevent further hair loss. It kinda surprised me after using it for a while. My hair get cleaner and fresher in the first few days and I can see some baby hair coming out after a period of time. I can&#x27;t tell how excited I was. You Should Try it !!!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo, my husband&#x27;s second bottle!!  It also lasts a long time and his scalp feels clean, his hair and scalp doesn&#x27;t feel dry and not all the flakiness.  He likes the ingredients in the shampoo and has also helped his&lt;br /&gt;thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Gave 1 star because i cant give 0.. Has my hair falling out more then when I used nothing</li>
    <li> It works awesomely. I used it 2 times and I feel much younger.I looked at myself in the mirror an laugh, saying, ha ha,  this shampoo works finely.i am convinced to write this review because I want to support purador and because I like this product. Thank You!And I lllllllllllllllooooooooovvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeee this wonderful product. I intend to buy more if intended and permitted by my husband.And again, this product rocks and I lllllllllllooooooooovvvvvvvveeeeeeeee it ! WooooHoooo! Yeah!</li>
    <li> I used to have long but sparse hair, and I decided to cut it short to make me looks great. I just started using it for 2 weeks, and I can feel  that it did prevent my hair loss. The smell is very natural and I can&#x27;t feel any chemistry component. Anyway, I feel satisfied so far and I can&#x27;t wait to see my hair growing.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s a bit expensive, I can guarantee that it&#x27;s worth it! I have noticed that my hair loss has reduced. The shampoo smells nice. Only negative comment that I could say is that it leaves your hair a bit dry so following up with a conditioner is a must. Great product; I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this shampoo for a month, but already see a difference in my hair. It seems healthier and thicker, as well as shiny. For an organic shampoo, it lathers well and smells nice. I plan to order again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is rather amazing.  I used to use a follicle booster from Nioxin, and this stuff works better and smells better.  I&#x27;ve only been using for a month, so hard to tell if it&#x27;ll actually help my hair stop thinning, but I&#x27;m pleased that many of the ingredients are the same, and it&#x27;s much cheaper for  larger volume than nioxin.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different shampoo. And I am ok with this product. Not very dramatic different.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product and have now used it several time and so far it is very good, with no problems.</li>
    <li> Is  it necessary  to buy conditioner</li>
    <li> Just opened my amazon box.....excited to try my new product I purchased. The dag-gone pump won&#x27;t &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; open....followed the &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; arrow for it to pop open. Great. Now I have to grab this big bottle with my petite hand and pour a wee bit into my hand every darn time. Boo!</li>
    <li> This is my on-going review (3/9 - 3/16 and 4/14/2015) for Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;and Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Argan oil Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 9, 2015 - I  received these products (shampoo &amp; conditioner) on 3/6/15. Because of stress and not sleeping for almost 2 weeks when there was a death in my family, my hair started falling out, and over 2-3 weeks I developed 5-6 bald spots.  I had been taking Biotin (5000mg per day), but thought there must be some kind of shampoo that would help my condition.  I found it on Amazon. The first time I used the shampoo, I followed the instructions and massaged my scalp and got a nice lather.  It rinsed out well and I didn&#x27;t need a 2nd shampoo.  Next I used the conditioner.  It felt good and after a few minutes I rinsed it out and gently comb through my hair.  To my surprise there was very little tangle and NO breakage!  After I blow-dried my hair, it felt soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 16, 2015 - I&#x27;ve used both the shampoo and conditioner twice since 3/9.  My hair is growing and is healthy, shiny and feels strong.  I&#x27;ve got about 1/4&amp;#34; of new growth where the bald spots were.  Normally my hair is fine but it didn&#x27;t have a natural &#x27;sheen&#x27; like it has now.  And where I didn&#x27;t have bald spots, my hair is much stronger. It is fine textured, but now it doesn&#x27;t feel limp and it doesn&#x27;t look dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 14, 2015 - I&#x27;ve been using both products twice a week. My hair is growing - almost a full inch since I started using these products a month and a half ago.  It&#x27;s healthy, not thin or limp; it&#x27;s soft-to-the-touch and has a nice sheen.  I&#x27;m a 69 year old, African-American woman.  Two weeks ago I was feeling so good about these products, I got up enough nerve to do some things to my hair that I wasn&#x27;t sure would work out:  I used a relaxer and I added a color rinse to cover the grey.  My hair looks and feels great!  And it keeps on growing.  Don&#x27;t know what I would have done if I hadn&#x27;t foundthese products, which I will continue to use.  I also told my hair dresser and a few friends who knew what had happened to me, about these products..&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo and the Organic Conditioner are the best and I highly recommend them to anyone with hair damage or loss.</li>
    <li> Just after about a month and half I can tell this is working.  Much better product than nioxin!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. It works.</li>
    <li> unlike other shampoo, it has smell of herbal and rich foam. General i lost lots of hair but this time not so much. Hope it really can improve hair loss.</li>
    <li> this shampoo works very well my and has slowly but surely reduced my hair loss (so glad for this product)</li>
    <li> So far so good. Using it in conjunction with Minoxidil foam and biotin. Hope to see good long term results and will update my review in a few months.</li>
    <li> I just got this shampoo and I can tell its already making my hair feel thicker and fuller than any other shampoo, I was using the volume shampoo by other well named products and my moms a beautician for over 30 years and I can say this is the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product..ive tried so many things for my thinning hair and excessive shedding and nothing has worked like this. I noticed a ddifference after only a week. My hair is fuller and I barely shed at all...my husband was so impressed he replaced his rogain with this shampoo and his hair has never looked better. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Just got the product and used once. Really like the smell and hair looks great after using it!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 1 month. I suffer from dry scalp during the winter months and off the shelf shampoos would iritate it further. I like the fact this product does not contain harsh chemicals and my scalp tollerates daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend this product and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Good item and good buy.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. My hair looks and feels alive. And it finally stopped falling. I am 21 and I thought I&#x27;m gonna go bold soon but this shampoo is helping me a lot. It might be pricey but it worth it.</li>
    <li> Cleans without drying my scalp, no heavy perfumes, and is relatively inexpensive. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different brands of &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; shampoos, but this one is my favorite.  It has a nice, light herbal scent, and it doesn&#x27;t foam up too much (usually an indicator of a high amount of sodium lauryl sulfate).  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the amount of hair loss after the first few weeks, but by the end of the month there was definitely less hair to pick up from the drain.  I would not say this is a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; shampoo, but it has helped me lose less hair than usual.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 2 years now, and honestly, my hair hasn&#x27;t been growing,  but there has been no hair loss that I have noticed. This shampoo is great for not losing hair. I also have been using other shampoos but they don&#x27;t work as well as purador.</li>
    <li> Decent shampoo.  No idea if it is actually doing what it claims.  I have been using this for about 8 months.  It does leave my hair feeling a little dry.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much ! Have a good time !  (:</li>
    <li> I get to know this amazing shampoo from my friends. Because I am a coder. Long time sitting in front of the laptop make me feel tired and can not sleep well. And it turns out to loos hair. I am really scared because I am just a young adult and can not stand hair loss. Luckily, a friend strongly recommend me with this type of shampoo. Hesitate at the beginning, I purchased one at Amazon, and have used it for just half month. However, I can see there is significantly less hair loss when I taking shower. I think it works. And just in half month!!! With happiness, I will continue to use it. I think it is the best shampoo in the world or at least most helpful shampoo for those have problem of hair loss.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the hairloss prevention as thankfully that is not an issue yet, but I can say that the formula is wonderful, it is all natural and I just know that my scalp appreciates all the wonderful ingredients it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it for a while, and now I feel like my hair is lacking a little volume, so I&#x27;m going to use it again and hopefully it will help give it that extra volume boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a product that smells good and best of all you can feel good using it.</li>
    <li> my farther really like it！</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month now and notice a decrease in hair loss during shower. I also notice for soft and shiny my hair looks. I will definitely recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> it is a great shampoo. I love its smell which is the same as some traditional Chinese medicines that are good for hair. it worthy a try.</li>
    <li> I was taking something that caused DHT buildup which I don&#x27;t normally have.  I am using this for about 3 months to stop the DHT.  So far, it is working very well.  No more sensations and my hair strands appear thicker and more back to normal.  DHT makes your hair strands thinner and weaker.  It works!!</li>
    <li> Shipped from the company very quickly! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and have been satisfied w/ the results! I&#x27;m looking forward to monitoring more long term results.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used this product and I am satisfied with it.  I noticed my falling hair has diminished.</li>
    <li> This has been the best shampoo that I have ever invested in. My hair is naturally hereditary very thin, although I do have a lot of it, and I shed immensely. I have tried everything from Pantene to Nia to Nioxin to Kerastase, even Horse shampoo, however, none of these products seemed to work. I came across Pura d&#x27;or one day and decided, based on my past relation with failure in the shampoo department, why not give it a try as I had nothing more to lose. Although, it take a few weeks to see the results, this was the best decision that I have ever made. My hair has never looked fuller ever before, even when I used to tease my hair, there is no comparison. My boyfriend also started using this product and will never turn to another make. If you have not tried Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, make sure you do, you will be in for a nice treat!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 I bought the 2 pack from Groupon back in Jan and saved money literally paid for one and got a free one. Anyways I have thin hair, receding hairline my hair has been thinning slowly so I bought this so that it can get thicker and prevent hair loss  and the more I used it the more my hair felt dry, THINNER and oily by the end of the day which is annoying. I now have less hair because of this shampoo, other guys reviews stating the same are right so guys if your hair is thin and oily look elsewhere. This month I have now turned to lipogaine minoxidil with a dandruff shampoo on the side to prevent scalp dryness from minoxidil, since  the lipogaine product has good ratings and is for guys, but anyways I still have a bottle left of Purador which I&#x27;m giving it to my friend who&#x27;s a girl as usually unisex shampoos, usually most of the time only work for women and now I know that... Guys stick to GUYS ONLY SHAMPOOS and guys only products which are made for guys for a reason.</li>
    <li> I am a propecia user, and this shampoo was strong enough to undo years&#x27; my effort armed with a prescription drug approved by FDA. Run away from this product! It just took a month to put me into the position of writing my first review here. Hopefully, I can get my hair back after stop using this product.</li>
    <li> this made my hair extremely dry and tangled and more hair fell out than when I was using OTC products. it also made my scalp really itchy</li>
    <li> I am using the shampoo and conditioner for about one month, the ingredients are all natural, it smells very nice, hair feels clean and soft and with a volume after using this shampoo. Not sure if its helping with any hair loss or hair growth, at this point i don&#x27;t see any difference. But I like this shampoo anyway, maybe I will buy again. 4 stars because it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> Who can really tell whether or not this stuff works.  I used to use Nioxin, but heard that their formula changed to something ineffective when they were bought out by a larger company.  I decided to try this one, and I can&#x27;t complain. Doesn&#x27;t seem like I&#x27;m going bald too quickly, lol.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband but did not see difference in hair .</li>
    <li> would nogt buy again, it is very expensive for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> Good product. Enjoyed the smell as well. Love it.</li>
    <li> Half a year now, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for a month.  Still need time to determine if is restoring hair for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times and found that my hair did feel fuller and fluffier--especially on the second day.  (My hair is very fine and thin.)</li>
    <li> What this product promised makes you expect highly from it. Maybe the bar was set too high so when the magic didn&#x27;t happen it&#x27;s still a regular shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months now but didn&#x27;t see the results. For the price I&#x27;ll think twice before buying it again.</li>
    <li> Shampoo does a good job of cleaning with a mild agreeable scent.  The one downside is my oily hair gets oily quicker when using this product.  Regarding preventing hair loss, increasing volume, &amp; supporting healthy hair growth, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.  I do prefer this product over Nioxin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over two months now and my experience with it is good. It does leave my hair a bit dry and it took about 5 days for my hair to get used to it but people did see an increase in hair on top of my head and it makes your hair feel thicker also. It doesn&#x27;t smell great but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either and the bottle lasts a long time. Being chemical free is also a big plus but I don&#x27;t think it will do miracles making all of your hair grow back.</li>
    <li> When each hair become more dear to you, treat them right.  Worth the money and I am not one to waste cash.</li>
    <li> My husband and I definitely think it helps our hair. It appears fuller and healthier.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has really helped. I have been using it for a while now. I used to wash my hair and would find hair all over the tub. Since using this consistently it has significantly reduced. Thanks</li>
    <li> Hair has def stopped falling out. Not sure if it is the vimulti or the shampoo but hair is best ever.</li>
    <li> It is a gift for my mother. It is good.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is absolutely amazing. I enjoy how clean my hair feels. This shampoo brings out the thickness of my hair. I was using Nioxin hair products for 5 years but I just noticed that they started adding harsh chemicals so I did research to find all organic shampoo and I found Pura d&#x27;or or. I am a customer for life now. Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have a problem of hair loss for quite some time now. I used this and was never dissapointed although it&#x27;s a bit expensive. But I prefer to buy products that are expensive and yet you know that they will work for you. So it&#x27;s still worth the money. Right now, I am experiencing a little bit of hair loss and I can see small hairs growing. Its an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Opinions seem to vary wildly on this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and am already experiencing noticeably less hair loss.  I will update after finishing my first bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the most satisfying hair loss prevention product I ever used. I stopped dropping lots of ..lots of hair after two weeks I kept using it</li>
    <li> Been using for about 2 and half months, did nothing for me, but probably accelerated my hair loss. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Definatley notice less hair loss in my when I shampoo.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is the second order.&lt;br /&gt;I have lost a lot hair from teen&#x27;s age. I used many kinds of shampoo recommended, but they weren&#x27;t enough good to me.&lt;br /&gt;This product is diffrent. I finally found my shampoo for preventing my hair loss. Whenever I sampoo every morning, I can feel my hair is getting healthy more and more. In addition, the scent is very good. I love it! 11-year-old, my daughter also uses this product. Her scalp is very sensitive. It&#x27;s perfect for her. Maybe, I will continue to use this shampoo to the time I could find a better shampoo, but I am sure that I must wait for that time for a long time. I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> After using this product, my hair seemed thicker and healthier. My hair felt smoother. I still had hair falling out and hair breaking but it was less then before I started using this product. I think this product is great, but I gave it a 4 because I dislike the smell of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Oh my god, my hair is the softest it&#x27;s ever been, almost no fallout after the first use and it smells amazing. I&#x27;m not sure if softness is really helpful for making my hair appear thicker but I guess I&#x27;ll see in a month or so.</li>
    <li> First day run and it feels good. Don&#x27;t need to use much either. Hair feels healthier than with regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic about hair loss treatments and it&#x27;s hard for me to admit that I actually think this product works. Though I know a lot of my hair fall is due to stress and managing my stress is probably the best hair loss prevention for me, this is this first product that I&#x27;ve noticed less hair fall while showering throughout my cycles of stress. Regardless of it&#x27;s effectiveness at preventing hair loss, it&#x27;s also just a great shampoo overall. It&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals, smells good, and the dispenser is great! I&#x27;ll be sticking with this product.</li>
    <li> I am still losing hair but I&#x27;m not sure if the hair falling out now needs to come out to make way for new healthy hair or if I&#x27;m still not getting to the root cause of my hair loss issue. The amount has decreased significantly however. AND I have noticed my hair filling in around my temples and hair line where before it just seemed thin and sad. There are small 1-inch hairs all over my head, some are two inches so I believe I am regrowing my hair. Overall I think I am on the road to recovery. Also my finger nails are growing so quickly I have to file them every other day, which I think is a good sign.    I have very fine hair that&#x27;s always been very healthy and can grow quite long. My hair loss issue started sometime over this past summer. I had given my hair a bit of beating since last winter. In my attempt to ween myself off of shampoo and conditioner, which was causing massive build up and dandruff (even organic and expensive brands) I tried several different alternative hair care routines. I tried the baking soda and apple cider vinegar only routine, which I would never recommend to anyone because it completely dried out my scalp. High quality shampoo bars, coconut oil masks, no shampoo at all etc. I finally ended up at the the moroccan method and that helped a little bit, but ultimately I was not happy with the way it made my hair look and became skeptical of the &#x27;detox&#x27; period the company claims your hair has to go through. My hair just looked thick and greasy most of the time. I still use their Euro hair oil but have abandoned most of the other products. Throughout this whole period large amounts of hair would come out in the shower and I started to notice my hair line receding and my part widening. Obviously it freaked me out. I&#x27;m a firm believer treating pretty much anything without a doctors help, because I have done so in the past with the help of my chiropractor and ayurvedic practitioner. So I got hard core in to the &#x27;real food&#x27; diet and revved up my ayurvedic routine and supplement intake.    I can&#x27;t contribute hair regrowth solely to pur&#x27;ador because I am doing several other things to help with my hair loss issue, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s everything or one thing that is helping. I got my blood tested to make sure there was not a significant health issue. I eat a quality seasonal diet comprised of good meats and veggies, pasture raised eggs and dairy. I make my own pasture raised chicken bone broth which I drink daily. I am also taking blackstrap molasses daily (for iron), 5000iu vitamin d, fish oils and fermented cod liver oil plus ayurvedic herbs. I take high amount biotin and upped my b vitamins. I take an adrenal supplement my chiropractor put me on from nutri-west called DSF formula, which has made a huge difference to my energy levels. I also massage doTerra lavender, cedarwood, rosemary and frankincense essential oils, moroccan method euro hair oil, primrose oil and aloe gel in to my scalp an hour before showering to stimulate and moisturize my scalp. I bought the Pura d&#x27;or hair loss shampoo and conditioner and wash my hair with it every other day, sometimes every third day. I air dry my hair and I only brush it when it is dry, I only use a bristle boar soft brush. I installed a high quality water filter in my shower to remove chemicals and other unnecessary additives. I may get my thyroid hormones tested just to make sure that is functioning properly as well. I bought pura&#x27;dor because of the good reviews and am happy that my hair actually looks nice after washing. If I&#x27;m going to lose hair at least the hair that is left can look nice!    I&#x27;ll try to report back in the future but as I said before, I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m impressed. It&#x27;s been about couple of weeks I&#x27;m using it, so will need more time to see the actual result. However, at least it seems to have the positive potential. The shampoo foams well, and does not have any unpleasant smell. I have used many hair loss shampoos over the years.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or for over a year now.  I am on my 3rd bottle and it one of the best shampoos I have used to stop hair loss.  Ever since I began using this shampoo, I have noticed that I do not shed as much hair as I used to while taking a shower.  I have noticed my hair not only get thicker, but also have more volume.  My hair stylist has even noticed and commented about the fullness of my hair.  I highly recommend Pura d&#x27;pr</li>
    <li> Wonderful product . Been using for a month and have noticed such an improvement in the condition of my hair.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for the price</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo. Requires a little amount compared to other regular brands, which makes it NOT much more expensive compared to generic brands. Makes your hair silky smooth..</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on September 17th, and received on Sep 19th. The reason why I did not wrote a review until today is because this product needs some time to try on and see if it works and then tell other customers if it is really useful. So after two months of using this products, my brother&#x27;s hair looks a little shining and nourishing, and of course some of his friends said his hair looks a little more thicker than before. We may keep our records updated because it needs time to find out, and we really recommend this product .</li>
    <li> Back to post my review afrer using for 2 months. The shampoo is better than other products, it good at oil control and good for my hair. The smell is great, just like tea tree oil which is calmful.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this product is the exception. only using it a few weeks and have already noticed less hair in the shower. thumbs up for the product.</li>
    <li> great product, all natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product leaves the hair feeling great and never oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for daily use.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, i notices a remarkable reduction in hair fall after every wash. My hairs are falling less as before were using this product.... so i am hoping the trend will continue and i will get my healthy looking hairs back after its continuous use. simply love this product... make my hairs bit dry , but if following up with the same brand conditioner its removes away that dryness...</li>
    <li> I got this for a roommate who is noticeably losing hair, but ended up using it myself as well. I am not sure if it works for hair growth because I just started using it. It is probably better than other shampoos because there are less chemicals. I personally love the smell. Very natural.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my son, he&#x27;s used this product for the last 2 yrs and swears by it.</li>
    <li> Lather&#x27;s well, even with hard water. Leaves hair feeling clean. Can&#x27;t speak to the hair loss portion as I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference (been using for 8 months).</li>
    <li> so ive been using this product for a few months now, and i can deffinatly see my hair is thickening. However, im also using 10,000 mcg biotin everyday as well, so im not sure if its the shampoo or the biotin. But the shampoo smells pretty good, and its all natural compared to all the chemical shampoos out there.I use as directed, i leave it in for two minutes and apply the conditioner afterwards. so its a pretty good product , i havent had any reactions or side affects to it so far, and will update if anything changes</li>
    <li> It has nice smell. I feel refreshed after using it.</li>
    <li> The smell is not too bad but I have notice less of my hair falling out.. which is the main reason I bought it!!</li>
    <li> So Far so good. It smells great, my hair feels soft and I am noticing a bit less hair fall. It&#x27;s only been a week but I have high hopes.</li>
    <li> I am Asian, I guess it might only be useful for other nations. My scalp was very itchy after using it for twice. I stopped using it now. Waste my money.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Makes my hair look great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for six weeks now and here are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The shampoo lathers rather well for me and I have a pretty full head of hair.  It only takes 2 pumps and I&#x27;m able to lather my entire head easily.  I&#x27;ve been washing my hair once a day and I&#x27;ve probably used an 8th or so of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The shampoo feels very nice and my head feels very clean and fresh after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I&#x27;m not sure how effective the shampoo is for hairloss for me yet.  I would say I&#x27;m shedding less hairs than I was prior but it hasn&#x27;t stopped hair from falling off my head.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a reasonable expectation though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the shampoo has a premium feel to it, cleans and freshens nicely, and should last a long time.  I believe it&#x27;s worth the higher pricetag.  Being organic and possibly helping hair loss is a plus.</li>
    <li> Of course you can&#x27;t see the effect in just one or two weeks, but I do smell ginger in it which is good for hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works. The first and second day I used it, I counted the hair what I loss, about 30-40, but after I follow the direction, let the shampoo stay on my hairs around 2 minutes, it worked, I counted the hair I loss,  it is about 10-20 . good product, I hope it will keep working.</li>
    <li> The seller is great, I got the shampoo at the right time.&lt;br /&gt;But I haven&#x27;t see any results yet with this shampoo I see is to much oil, because my hair is very oily, but I will give a try, base on .....I am losing my hair. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t give it five stars!</li>
    <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed this shampoo thus far. I have been using it for about 4 weeks now and have definitely felt a difference. I have been suffering from thinning hair for a couple years now. This may be due to a number of things including stress, hormone deficiencies, genetics, etc. This shampoo is the first organic shampoo I have used with all natural ingredients without the inclusion of SLS (harmful sulfides). As far as the effectiveness for regrowth, I am not quite sure. I have not necessarily seen regrowth in hair yet but I have definitely felt like my hair has gained strength and thickness. The fragrance is fantastic which is another positive for those that are concerned about smelling good. This shampoo leaves your hair feeling clean, smelling good, and looking thicker. The ingredients are used to keep your healthy hair on your head and to minimize the shedding that comes with age. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone with thinning hair looking to keep the hair they have as healthy as possible.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is phenomenal. I have naturally thinning hair due and every time I take a shower, I notice A LOT of hair in the drain. Upset, I ordered this shampoo and I can honestly say I notice my hair feeling thicker and there is not nearly as much hair left in my brush or in the drain. I highly recommend this shampoo - well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> My brother began losing his hair shortly after he turned 17, so I consider myself lucky that my hairline held out until I hit 25, but once I noticed that my hair was retreating I decided I&#x27;d better try and head it off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost 6 months now, and I&#x27;m honestly very impressed. Within 6 weeks I noticed that my hair felt much thicker and had a healthier texture than it had before. After about 4 months I started to notice new hair growing in around my temples where it had been thinning previously.&lt;br /&gt;I use the shampoo every 1-2 days, and leave it on for about five minutes, and that seems to work well for me. I&#x27;m impressed enough that now that we&#x27;re into the winter months and my scalp is starting to get a little dry, I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing the conditioner as well (http://amzn.com/B007TC0HIC).</li>
    <li> I love this product. It feels so smoothly and it smells really good. I keep using it for couple weeks and I do see that my hair problem becomes better (it starts to lose less). I will see how it goes after 6 month~~</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo ever, it really works! I started noticing that my hair was thinning out and felt like I needed to do something ASAP. I decided to give this a try. I used it for a couple weeks and I really noticed less and less hair falling out while I showered. Its not going to regrow your hair but it will preserve the hair that you have left. It honestly worth using everyday to keep your confidence, and it smells great as well. I received a discount to review this product.</li>
    <li> My hair has bcome thicker from it. Only negative is that it takes quite a few pumps to get a good lather in your hair.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a little over a month.  Feels great.  The scent isn&#x27;t too bad either.  I will post updates as I will give this a 6 month run to see what happens.</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair to stop shedding excessively within the first week. By week number 2 it was even less and I have been using the bottle am almost finished and I can honestly say there are days that go by and will have no hairs fall out. This product works!</li>
    <li> I love the scent and the tingle on the scalp. As to the efficacy of hair growth/loss prevention, only time will tell. I appreciate the pump bottle packaging, which makes for easy dispensing.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo about a month ago, maybe even less.  I am taking this with biotin.  I use a conditioner too but it&#x27;d just a regular conditioner from walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am losing my hair. The dreadful M shape is showing. My hair is receding and you can see my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a few weeks, hair is growing at the &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; area.  What&#x27;s so surprising is there are some strands that grew to be the same length as my normal growing hair.  By I mean &amp;#34;some strands,&amp;#34; I mean... hair in an area where I haven&#x27;t had hair for years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious to see what 3 months will bring...</li>
    <li> I bought this 2 months ago, it feels like it&#x27;s working but it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
    <li> It works. I used a bottle and seems like I have less hair loss that before.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased it for her hair that is beginning to thin, due to age, medication and a lifetime of hair coloring. I became immediately interested, as at the magical age of 51, my hair is thinning too and supposed &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; shampoos really don&#x27;t work. After two weeks of daily use, we both can already see a noticeable improvement in hair volume and texture. I can&#x27;t wait to see what lush heads of hair we are going to have a few months from now! I can already see new micro-fine hair growth on us both at the scalp line.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans your scalp and hair quite well, but it is a bit drying to hair on its own, so a conditioner is a must when using it.&lt;br /&gt;We are so pleased so far, we are buying more and this time, ordering the conditioner as well, to see what results the combination brings. This is the first hair care product we have ever tried that actually lives up to what it claims to do. Great Stuff!</li>
    <li> This shampoo gives my head the tingly sensation, and it feels soo good, I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the smell, but I noticed my hair is a lot more thicker than normal</li>
    <li> Nicely foamy and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I have been loosing hair for sometime since I started coloring and using hair straightening products. Since I started using this product, I do see a decline in hair falling while shampooing. I did try to switch to other products like Nioxin and Satinique but saw more hair fall and when I switch back to this product there was less hair fall. So for sure this product does help in hair loss prevention for me.</li>
    <li> So far pretty good stuff..</li>
    <li> Great product! I have long and curly hair. My hair loose is getting much better after a month use this product. Will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; Shoulders for a long time and just recently started using this. It smells good and leaves you feeling clean! It feels nice to know that it&#x27;s made with good ingredients that won&#x27;t cause your hair to fall out. And as far as nice organic shampoos go, it&#x27;s not expensive at all. I also have short hair so it&#x27;ll last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several shampoos for hair loss and prevention, and none have worked so far. So I&#x27;m assuming, in the long haul, this shampoo won&#x27;t be the miracle in a bottle everyone searches for. However, as a shampoo and new user, I find it does exactly what normal shampoo should; clean your hair and the head it&#x27;s attached to, and it does it well. So why pay the extra if I&#x27;m not sure if it works? For the same reason, I&#x27;m still using rogaine and taking biotin pills.. The fear if I stop what I&#x27;m doing I&#x27;m going to expedite the hair loss. I&#x27;d rather pay the extra so I can sleep a little better at night.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have used it regularly now for about 2 months.  I have noticed a decrease in hair loss on the top of my head.  Will keep using it for now.</li>
    <li> I love the smell n how it lathers. love using it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s done a lot for hair loss, but it&#x27;s much, much, better than the stuff I was paying $1 or $2 a bottle for. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out the way cheap shampoo does, and it got rid of my dandruff. I will continue to use it. Good, but not amazing, shampoo.</li>
    <li> I like to buy things on subscribe and save. I needed one more item to save 15% and I searched for &amp;#34;subscribe and save organic&amp;#34; and I found this shampoo. I used to use Nioxin but I switched all of my products over to cleaner options free of dyes, parabens, sulfates, harsh chemicals etc. I have not found anything that could replace this type of shampoo that was natural... until now. I am so glad I stumbled across this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to have a total hysterectomy at the age of 27 and I am going through surgical menopause as a result. My hair is very dry, thin, and I am excessively shedding. I have used sweet almond oil at night on my hair to help with the dryness before buying this shampoo. That seemed to help, After using this product for almost 2 weeks I really notice a difference. This definitely added volume to my hair. I also notice less shedding in the shower. I didn&#x27;t order the conditioner to use with the shampoo. I use Acure Pure Mint +  echinacea stem cell  volumizing conditioner with this shampoo. I can only imagine what the results would be if I used the conditioner as well. Hopefully, they will offer their conditioner on subscribe and save soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels really soft and smells good. I will definitely continue to be subscribed to this product!!</li>
    <li> It is the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used. I had a serious problem on losing hair and tried different kind of expensive shampoo. This shampoo is amazing. I can see the loss hair on my comb is getting less. And I love the natural smell of the product. I will continue to use it and prevent my hair loss problem!</li>
    <li> Feels good using it. I used Avalon Organics Thickening Shampoo and Conditioiner before and felt quite itchy after using them. This one feels good and even don&#x27;t need conditioiner.</li>
    <li> I have used it for over a month. So far like it. I still loose hair but seems less.</li>
    <li> I like this product smell especially it has the argan oil in the formula. I use this shampoo to prevent hair lossing, and it just works fine. I may give a try on it&#x27;s orangic shampoo as well.</li>
    <li> Have only used it for a few weeks but hair feels much healthier (less dry, etc.) As for the hair loss part, I think it has helped but only time will tell.</li>
    <li> From the first few times I used it I could tell there was a difference. There was not chunks of hair coming out while I was showering and I even noticed on my brush that there was barely any hair on it after brushing my hair. Usually chunks of hair would fall out after brushing it. I really like this product and recommend it. This will definitely be the only shampoo that I will be using from now on. Only downside is that it drys your hair so you need to use a lot of conditioner. But I would take dry hair over no hair any day!!</li>
    <li> it seems useful to me. i can not see my hair clearly myself, but my wife says that my hair really got thicker.</li>
    <li> My hair is a lot stronger and thicker after about 3 months of using this stuff. Works great for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 2 months now and I can say that it has been helpful to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The very first thing that I evidently noticed after only a couple days was that it really added volume to my hair and my long hair became more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;The more important aspect, which the name of the product refers to, is the hair loss prevention. It is very hard to tell quantitatively how much it has prevented loss of my hair, but from the hair that remains in bath tub after shower it seems that my hair loss has decreased. I will continue using it and we will see how much it would be effective in long run.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this shampoo!  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and the results are great.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it prevents hair loss, but it is an excellent shampoo!</li>
    <li> It took me a while to get use to not a silky smooth feeling of my heir, but I know it&#x27;s because of the natural ingredients. I love the smell, but i still loos my heir, maybe it&#x27;s lack of nursing. Maybe I  should get a very moisturizing condition for a smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and I am extremely happy with it. this the healthiest my hair has been in a long time. I have been going as chemical free as I can and this product is great.</li>
    <li> This product increase the volume of my hair after using for 10 days. Actually, my hair become more strong and seem healthier. In addition, the smell of this shampoo remains me the natural smell of middle east gardens.</li>
    <li> This is a really great shampoo I would recommend it to everyone, my hair line started to recede my scalp will itch intensively, my hair started thinning, and shed like crazy and there was no other product will help, after purchasing it I used it for about 6-8 months the size of the bottle is economical I wish it was bigger, the fragrance is so soothing and smells inviting, the product leaves the scalp breathable you can actually feel the fresh air on the scalp, so my hair started to full out in the places that was thinning and even grew about 4-5 inches more, my hair dresser was impressed and loves what this shampoo does and even ask for me to order her one for her personal use and I did</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this one, many friends recommended this. Hope it will work!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is excellent first time I have ever used it I was very happy with this product .My hair was fuller stronger and has a great shine to it organic all the way so much better .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I have not seen any hair loss at all... I would recomend it to anybody... Thank you looking forward to trying the conditioner next</li>
    <li> Very good organic shampoo.  Does a good job thickening your hair but haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes with hair loss (nothing really helps with hair loss).  Leaves hair and scalp dry but thats how hair loss shampoos work.  Great organic shampoo but dont expect a full head of hair if your losing it.</li>
    <li> i loose more hair after then shower then I would using baby shampoo (which is very gentle),&lt;br /&gt;if on average in the shower and once done will loose 20 pieces of hair, but its over 50 if using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;one thing that noticed its that hair will look fuller in volume once hair gets dry from the shower,&lt;br /&gt;but other then that there&#x27;s other shampoos that give the same results,&lt;br /&gt;in the beginning i was lost on why this product has so many reviews and purchases, but then i realized that people love it because of the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;full volume&amp;#34; aspect,&lt;br /&gt;but i got it because im a guy and loosing alot of hair in the shower (im also taking Rogain and Avodart) so thought also have to protect myself in the shower from hair loose</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful herbal/organic shampoo, not just a hair loss product. I have researched quite a few herbal shampoos in a bid to move from the harmful chemical ones. I just got this one a couple of weeks ago and I am really loving the results it produced on my hair. I have thick coarse hair, so I bought this shampoo more for the herbal ingredients listed than for use as hair loss shampoo. It took a bit more amount than I usually use to produce lather, which is expected given the ingredients, they did not weigh my hair down, which I was afraid of. Overall, I am loving this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to use organic/herbal products for their hair.</li>
    <li> Smell good, feels good and no weird feeling on your hands after you wash it off like other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Within the first couple weeks of using it I had my mom make a comment that it looked like I was sprouting new hairs and she asked if I was using rogaine. It smells fine, not too fruity, not too foul. Lathers up nice.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about a month now.  Seems just fine for shampoo but I have yet to notice any difference in terms of hair loss or volume.  I&#x27;m assuming as with most products like this, you won&#x27;t see results over night.</li>
    <li> This product seems functional on me. I will keep using for a longer period to see whether a significant effect will happen. But overall, the product is good. One thing to note that the hair will be very dry after using this product.</li>
    <li> I like Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic because my hair has gotten thicker since I have used this product for 2 months.  When I rub into my scalp it has a good amount of lather.</li>
    <li> Great product - leaves my hair feeling soft and full-bodied without any residue. It&#x27;s easy to use and the packaging and nozzle are perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and it the best by far the cleanest feeling shampoo I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product a few times but I am a fan! I will continue to use until the bottle is gone. It is hard to say if the &amp;#34;Hair Loss&amp;#34; promise it true just yet, but it leaves my hair feeling great and I have less shedding when I wash it. I can appreciate the &amp;#34;naturalness&amp;#34; of the product. I at least know what is being put on my hair. I hope to update later once I have seen the true results.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty good. It leaves my hair clean and managable.  In terms of helping to prevent hair loss, it worked great when I intially started to use it. I was having quite a bit of hair ending up in the shower drain before I started to use it, then that stopped.  At various times some of my hair does still come out, but I think that&#x27;s mostly related to stress. I&#x27;ve tried several other shampoos and would recommend this as a good every day shampoo.</li>
    <li> Might work for others, but did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I was losing a handful of hair everytime I washed my hair... I read the reviews on this shampoo and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I am so happy! Increased volume and decreased shedding! I am very pleased.  The reviews I read were definitely accurate.  I will order another bottle when I am through with this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice since purchase, but it&#x27;s really made a difference in the health of my hair and scalp. I&#x27;ve already noticed a reduction in hair loss, it&#x27;s shiny and just appears to be so healthy.</li>
    <li> Have to say that this is the most mild shampoo I have ever used.it makes me feel comfortable and relax after using. I have the problem of hair loss and tried many kind of shampoo which never worked. Hope this item will effect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now and I must say, it not only leaves my hair clean and soft, but it has slowed down the volume of hair I was losing with each shampoo and simple light brushing.  I do also take one daily Biotin (10,000 mcg) vitamin supplement.  I am so happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair extremely clean and fresh and with the same sensation as if hair conditioner is used. The difference against conventional shampoos is noticeable immediately starting using it. I recommend to anybody that want to improve the hair condition.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful. It cleanses any buildup and isn&#x27;t at all drying. If you&#x27;re used to a shampoo that foams heavily, this will take some getting used to, as it does not foam much at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months or so and I have a spot on my hair that was bald because of pulling my hair back in a pony tail when I was younger now my hair is a short cut.. but ive been seeing little hairs growing back on that bald spot a week ago.m and my hair feels and looks thicker I also have alopecia so I have my scalp exposed a lil but it seems to be a lil fuller this is a great product and iam seeing results just give it a chance like a few months or so.. I mean ur not going to see results the day u use it... so give it time.. I mean people are different so u might get results or maybe not.. but it doesnt hurt to try if your losing your hair.. RIGHT ♥ good luck to all</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and it leaves my hair soft. So far I have noticed less hair loss, but its only been a month.</li>
    <li> I was having intense hair loss and I could see my hairs all around on the bed sheet when i woke up and in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend recommended this product to me and i ordered it 3 months back, after using it for 2-3 weeks , every alternate day my hair loss has reduced by more than 70-80%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance of it as well. I have recommended this to many of my friends for healthy hair and every one just loves this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give a thumbs up and recommend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> well... at least is organic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo almost every day for two weeks. For the first few days, I tried not to use conditioner after shampooing and I noticed that my hair got really dry and fussy, so it was really hard to brush my hair. I also noticed my hair were getting dirty really fast, that&#x27;s why it was necessary to wash my hair every day. Then I started conditioning like I used to do and everything became just fine. The main purpose of this product is to prevent hair loss and I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s working, at least I don&#x27;t see lots of hair on my brush which is a good sign. So, I&#x27;ll give it a more try. I&#x27;ll probably continue to use the product for another few months and if I don&#x27;t see much of the difference, I&#x27;ll switch the shampoo on less expensive ones...</li>
    <li> I tried Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic shampoo when my hair started getting thinner and thinner, and I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the result. I haven&#x27;t found a better shampoo for thinning hair yet, and I&#x27;ve sampled many. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than half a year now, and my hair looks noticeably thicker and healthier. Even my hairdresser has commented on the difference and noted that there has been more new hair growth where it&#x27;s thinning. All the results without the harsh chemicals, too! I dye my hair twice a year and require sulfate-free shampoo to keep the color fresh, so this is one of only a few shampoos for thin hair that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals and sulfates. Many shampoos will strip your color out, but this one doesn&#x27;t do anything of the sort. The only con I can offer (hence, for me, it earns four stars instead of five) is that the fragrance of this shampoo is not the best. It&#x27;s not disgusting, but it is a more organic, herbal fragrance and not something I would have chosen for fragrance alone. The results it gives, though, are worth giving up prettier smelling shampoos. At least its fragrance doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes like Nioxin&#x27;s does! I recommend pairing it with a good conditioner (Milk_shake is a great match!). Will Pura d&#x27;or magically grow you a head of luscious, celebrity worthy hair? No. But if you&#x27;re like me and are cursed with thin or thinning hair, it could make you feel a whole lot better about yourself!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo 3 weeks ago. specifically gave myself enough time to experience it before come making a review.&lt;br /&gt;the smell is comfortable (a bit of earthy plant smell), not as a lot of non-clear shampoo, this one is really nature. seems preventing hair loss at about 50% so far.  Would be willing to continually using this product. It does gave ur hair some dry feeling right after while it&#x27;s still wet, but totally smooth and soft after hair dry off.</li>
    <li> I started using this product because I had a lot of hair fall. And it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks since i&#x27;ve been using this shampoo, but I can already notice changes. Although I still have hair fall, it has reduced by a noticeable amount!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any clear results with the hair loss prevention but I am willing to try it again and see how it works!</li>
    <li> It really works! I have been using this shampoo for almost 2 months and i think it&#x27;s time to give it five stars. I instantly felt much lesser hair fall since i started using the shampoo. My scalp feels great and so does my hair .</li>
    <li> I like this product, and I have noticed a fullness to my hair as a result of using it.  My hair has always been fine and thin, and no other product has worked as effectively as this one.  I have not noticed regrowth, which is the only reason that I did not give it five stars.  But it&#x27;s a high quality product and well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> very useful, my hair has been saved.</li>
    <li> terrible dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> After reading most of the reviews, I was very excited when I received this. I saw results in the first use and now after 2 weeks my hair loss is completely gone. I had extreme hairloss, so this was like heaven to me! I would recommend this to everyone with hair loss problems. Your hair will be fuller and healthier within the first week!</li>
    <li> Really feels good on the scalp.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt; has made my hair thicker with more volume. Using this product for life</li>
    <li> really prevent loosing hair while shower.</li>
    <li> Hair feels quite clean after washing with this product.  Hair does not feel weighed down or coated.  Hair volume seems improved.  Using about a nickel to quarter size amount of shampoo goes a long way while lathering the hair.  Have been using the product for about 6 weeks now, too early to tell if this product truly prevents hair loss, only time will tell.  Overall, I like this product.</li>
    <li> It is pretty good, water in CA is bad, and lead to my hair loss, this product makes the situation better, I like it!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and like the way my hair feels afterwards. I have seen less of my hair falling out.</li>
    <li> Omg omg amazing I already am on my second bottle and gave one to my mo for after chemo and 2 friends my hair stopped falling out in the first week now 3 months later unbelievable results Ty ty ty ty</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of other shampoos on amazon.com before this (pretty expensive ones too) but did not quite find the &amp;#34;Holy Grail&amp;#34; I was looking for. I stumbled on this and wanted to give it a try. For the first couple of times I used it, I did not find any big difference or improvement over others. Then i realized I was rinsing immediately after I applied it. In the directions, its mentioned that we are supposed leave-in for couple of mins and then rinse. I tried doing that and to my surprise, It ws a totally different way my hair felt. I don&#x27;t quite believe it stops genetic hair loss (because its from the inside that the follicles are damaged) but due to its organic nature, hair is not damaged and the moisture not lost. I can honestly say this is the best shampoo I have used till date and plan on using it for a long time as long as the quality remains the same</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo! I really like that it is organic because we absorb chemicals through our skin and the fewer bad chemicals, the better. I have used only one bottle to date, so am not yet sure if it prevents hair loss -- but it certainly does not do any damage. It leaves my hair feeling soft, not stripped. Unlike another reviewer, I did not experience any dandruff at all (and I have had dandruff in the past which was controlled with anti-dandruff shampoo once a week). I intend to use this organic Pura D&#x27;or shampoo for 6 months. Then I should be able to tell if my aging hair is falling out less! Will update this review then.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I was reluctant to pay that much at first but when I tried it at a family member&#x27;s house I quickly realized what all her fuss was about. It left my hair shiny and healthy looking on the first use and the hair that&#x27;s been growing in looks better (I&#x27;ve been using it a couple months now). I am also using an LLLT comb and taking vitamins including saw Palmetto.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Hair feels clean but not stripped of natural oils. Does not lather too much but that&#x27;s probably because of it&#x27;s more &#x27;natural&#x27; ingredients versus sulfates/parabens etc. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to assess it&#x27;s hair loss/hair thickening benefits...but I will update this review when I do!</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo.  Hair feels fuller after just a couple of uses.  Smells great too.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it actually works in preventing hair loss, but it does smell organic and my hairs feel and look pretty good after a week of use. They are moisturized and have a healthy shine to them. I have tried other products like Nioxin #5 and Bosley. I would rate this product &amp;#62;&#x3D; Bosely &amp;#62; Nioxin. As far as I can tell for my hairs, this product is doing the same thing but using more natural ingredients. Overall, I would give this a shot first before using the more artificial products like Bosely and Nioxin.</li>
    <li> Clear, does a great job...takes very little to clean hair. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I wan using this product for the first time, and I chose this one because of seeing other customers&#x27; positive feedback. So I hope my thin hair will grow more thicker than now.</li>
    <li> I give it four stars just because it is a little pricey. I have used twice so far. My hair starts becoming less dry and shiny. There is still hair falling off though. I guess i need to keep using it. Overall, it feels good and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> It is a so great shampoo. I lost my hair for couple of years. Recently, my hair loss stop. THANK YOU SO MUCH, Pura d&#x27;or</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the late 40s and start to see the sign of hair turning loose. I happened to see ad of this product two months back and decided to give it a try based on its good reviews. I have used it for one and half months now and absolutely love it. The hair definetely feels thicker and more Voluminous. My hair is very oily before. This product seems to control the oil very good.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has made my hair stop falling out! My husband is even starting to grow some hair back on his head! This stuff is amazing!  Just bought 2 more bottles!</li>
    <li> Shampoo is very gentle on my hair and use it daily and sometimes 2x a day (for working out). Compared to other hair loss shampoo options price is also very reasonable.  As far as hair loss prevention, will check back in six months and update as true prevention takes time to prove.</li>
    <li> Great product! Effective for me! I have finished almost one bottle. It starts to be effective very soon; I can feel my hair becomes healthier and grows. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> ...but makes your scalp a little bit dry</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this shampoo. It certainly lathers well and hopefully it due time, I will see more noticeable improvements in my hair. However this shampoo costs more than I would normally be comfortable spending. If my hair improves significantly of course, then the cost would certainly be worth it but it is too early to tell as of now</li>
    <li> Really Good! I have tried a lot of shampoo, and this one help me stop losing hair. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has really helped slow down the hair loss. After trying so many brands this is the only one that delivered noticeable results! I just massage it into the scalp and leave it in for 3-4 mins. Within 5 days i started noticing fewer hairs on my hands after shampooing. For men suffering from androgenic alopecia I dont think simply using this shampoo will get you back a full head of hair but adding it to your current hair loss teatments will definitely be a big plus. Like all hair loss treatments you have to be patient and wait at least 3-4 months to see results. Sure it is not the best smelling shampoo but to me that does not matter because the shampoo actually works and it only means that it has no artificial perfumes- it has a cedar/rosemary oil smell. Eitherway for optimal results following up with a conditioner is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shampoo. It leaves my hair very light and does add some volume. From that light hair feel, it&#x27;s obvious that it rinse clean, a nice benefit. Can&#x27;t say if I noticed reduction of hair loss (hasn&#x27;t been that long since I started using it) but it sells great and improved the feel of my short hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo, leaves hair clean but not dried out like many shampoos with added chemicals do.</li>
    <li> some of those close to me have already noticed the improvement in my hair thickness.&lt;br /&gt;though I cannot tell if all the credit should go to this shampoo since I am also taking oral biotin at the same time. but I surely will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my imagination or not, but it really does seem like I am losing less hair!  There is definitely less when I shower.  But I have made some other changes in my diet, so it&#x27;s hard to tell.  But I will keep using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d or organic shampoo for over 8 months and won&#x27;t use anything else because of its all natural ingredients.  It lathers up like a regular shampoo and leaves my hair looking and feeling great. I&#x27;m also amazed at how long one bottle lasts.</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems to have a quality control problem.  The shampoo was ok for the first month, and then I was away for 6 weeks.  On my return, the shampoo had thickend so much it wouldn&#x27;t pump out anymore.  I could remove the top and get some out but it was the consistincy of thick goo.  It looked like it was made with some kind of plastic based chemicals.  I don&#x27;t think the ingredints on the bottle are really what it is made from.  It did not feel like it was healthy on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 months .  a little goes along way also I notice my hair feels thicker and I have less hair in my brush ! I would recommend this product to any one who has fine hair :) I love it</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves no residue...a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see the improvement</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister and she used up the whole bottle. It made her hair nice but didn&#x27;t prevent hairloss.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo so far I like it</li>
    <li> I was using other shampoos at the time and it would not help with my hair loss. This shampoo actually reduced the amount of hair I lost and made my hair feel like it was full of volume. I recommended this product to another friend who is also dealing with hair loss and they were super excited to try it out. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE FIRST BOTTLE, AND I think it&#x27;s helpful,  I have been using to help me keep my hair!</li>
    <li> I have been used it for more than one month. It works!!!  I used to see hair near shower drain. now it is much less.  I have recommend it to my best friend.</li>
    <li> DEAL! For a few bucks you can have the best hair you never thought you could have.  No kidding, this is amazing in how quickly I saw results. I know the bottle pump isn&#x27;t a big deal, but I love that it isn&#x27;t a mess and you pump out just what you need each time you&#x27;re in the shower, vs using too much and waiting for the soap to come to the opening when it runs low.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to what really matters: My hair got thicker almost immediately after using this, the very thin strands are getting thicker day by day. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good.</li>
    <li> Smells great and im not loosing as much hair. But i feel you need to put a lot in your hair to make it lather and soapy. Overall my hair is smooth and feels healthier.</li>
    <li> I have waited a couple of weeks to provide a review. This product is really amazing. It&#x27;s aa great shampoo that you can use on a daily basis. When massaging the scalp the shampoo will turn into a thick foam with a great scent. It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair dry so there is no special need for a conditionner. Now the hair loss part: it clearly and rapidly ( couple of days) make your hair thicker, smoother and stronger. You should always let the shampoo on the scalp for at least 5 minutes to let the scalps absorbs the active components. After a couple of weeks I noticed that te hairloss has tremendously slow down to a point where I believed it stopped entirely. Even better, some new hair are growing at the edge of my hairline, right where I started losing them a couple of years ago! I don&#x27;t even go in travel or weekends gateways without this shampoo. Great product!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews and I&#x27;ve decided that this product deserves a piece of my mind. I need to be clear with everyone who reads this...I have not had problems with hair loss, but I have had issues with thining, and I have to say this product after a year and a half of use, has increased the volume and density of my hair substantially, when I go to get a hair cut, you can actually hear the scissors work through my hair and my barber has even noticed the difference after 15 years of working on the same head every week....bottom line it works far better then regular salon quality shampoos, can&#x27;t say if restores hair loss.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of the shampoo, my husband comments on it every time. I wish it would lather a bit more. It&#x27;s only been a month since I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo so I think there&#x27;s more to write at a later time. For now, my hair feels very soft and manageable which I like.</li>
    <li> I only gave this four stars instead of five because of the pump. Don&#x27;t know if it is just my bottle but pump doesn&#x27;t come all the way back up after you push it down. That being said I have extremely oily thin hair and this works great for volume and keeping clean. I can go every other day with washing now as long as I use dry shampoo which is unheard of for me. The smell is good and makes your scalp feel tingly and refreshed. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;ll thicken up the hair you have, but won&#x27;t stop your loss.</li>
    <li> It smells really good and my hair feels soft and healthy.  I love that it is organic and natural.  If it helps my hair to grow thicker that would be great too, time will tell.  Even if not I will keep using it since it I like it for other reasons as well.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me. Very expensive too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 1/2 months and my hair loss has almost stopped!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really quite nice. I feel like my hair is quite thicker and I have been losing much less hair lately, it seems like this shampoo is actually working. I have to use about 3 pumps in order for it to lather up nicely. I also use it on my beard.</li>
    <li> My hair falls considerably less than what it used to be before i used the shampoo although it hasn&#x27;t completely stopped.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this is the OG... After one use my hair felt revitalized and thicker. After repetitive appliances, my hair had began regrowing and thickness has certainly increased. Seriously, give this a try, be gentle, and let the product do its course. Keep it 100</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It makes your hair smooth and control the hair loss.</li>
    <li> I like the packaging it&#x27;s better than the usual tall shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;smells great, did not notice hair loss while showering.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s good product for hair loss issue.</li>
    <li> Started using it for past 3 weeks. Hair fall seem to have reduced a bit. But have to wait and see for few more months</li>
    <li> i have been using for few months haven&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 1 month, along with vitamins....and so far it has made no difference in my hair loss.  It lathers quite well &amp; has an ok smell.  It also leaves my hair smooth, and possibly even shinier. I don&#x27;t need a conditioner with this shampoo.  The only problem is that it hasn&#x27;t yet helped me with my hair loss, which is my only concern!&lt;br /&gt;After reading all these miraculous reviews here, I was expecting it to work wonders for me too.  Unfortunately that has not been the case.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it for a few more months &amp; will report my progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It has now been 2 months of using Pura d&#x27;or &amp; I cannot report any progress in my hair loss.  I keep losing the same amount of hair in the shower &amp; after.  I have also noticed that my hair became a bit dry, possibly because I haven&#x27;t been using the conditioner every time I wash.&lt;br /&gt;I do feel a bit upset &amp; somewhat \\&quot;cheated\\&quot;...I now have to say that most of these miraculous reviews are probably fake.  I don&#x27;t think this shampoo is worth its cost &amp; I seriously doubt it does what it advertises.  I will use it for another month.</li>
    <li> seems to work so far  just started using but has nice scent</li>
    <li> Apparently, the shampoo gave me some kind of an allergy as I was itching every time I used it so I stopped using it after the second time.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product a short time, but this far I am pleased with the results. It cleans deeply and leaves a healthy shine my hair had lost previously. Hopefully it will stand up to the true test..... Time.</li>
    <li> It really help prevent hair loss.  It works for me.  My hair has more volume and feels so soft after washing.</li>
    <li> Just started using it but so far so good, My hair feels thicker.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> My hair and scalp feel really clean after using this shampoo. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So far, I have been using this product for approx. a month. I have not noticed a big difference however, it seems to have helped minimize my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo for three weeks and have noticed that my hair and scalp is cleaner.  No build-up! It does, however, make my hair dryer and coarser, even when I used the conditioner after shampooing. I have not noticed less hair fall nor more hair growing on my head. I hope to see these promised results after more time with the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two weeks. It does make my hair feel clean without a lot of suds. I can&#x27;t really say it feels thicker or looks thicker, but my son used it first and he feels it makes his hair feel and look thicker.</li>
    <li> Its been a month since I started using it and it seems to be good. I can see that my hair fall during taking bath has been reduced after this shampoo -but I dont think i got hair growth because of this - but I am glad that this shampoo helps in preventing more hair fall during headbath that used to happen in the past for me. Like the smell too - hope i get good results using it for longer time,</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for four months now, and I have to say I&#x27;m quite impressed with it. The price is very reasonable considering the quantity per container, and the smell of the shampoo is really good. But most importantly this shampoo considerably reduced dandruff and scalp itching. For years I used ketoconazole-based shampoos to manage my hair, but with this shampoo I officially stopped doing that. It seems that the DHT inhibitors and vitamins in this shampoo really did their job well as it seems to have strengthened my hair as well. It will probably take a lot longer to be able to assess the effect of this shampoo on restoring the lost hair on some parts of my scalp, but I definitely shed less hair than before every time I wash my hair. I&#x27;m gonna stay with this shampoo for the foreseeable future, and I would highly recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> Hair is growing back and also grey is turning back to original brown color.</li>
    <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t have the cheap cleaners of drug store shampoos and you&#x27;ll pay for it. But my hair is also in better shape - leaves it soft and strong. I&#x27;m doing a couple of things to prevent hair loss, so it&#x27;s hard to know for sure if this shampoo is making a big difference, but I&#x27;ve liked the way it leaves my hair. And I know it&#x27;s not doing any damage. It has biotin, which is good for hair strength, but lacks an anti-inflammatory that other hair loss shampoos have.</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair product I have ever used. I found this product from a website and just wanted to try a new thing at the beginning. My hair smells good and feels really soft and looks more healthy after using it for a few weeks. Now I feel more comfortable and confident, even without using a conditioner any more. Bty, the price is also reasonable. Like it very much!</li>
    <li> Used to use the Nioxin shampoo, but after they changed their formula decided to look for an alternative. Tried the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and have been very satisfied so far. A conditioner with this shampoo is optional.</li>
    <li> Organic shampoo without harsh chemicals works well for my hair !!</li>
    <li> It have definitely reduced less hair falling out when I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> if yall want to know the truth , read this , I just looked up a ingredient in this product and it wasnt what the company said it was. http://www.thenaturalhavenbloom.com/2012/06/natural-products-why-you-should-ignore.html</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It has a great scent, cleans well, and has made a difference in the thickness of my hair.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> it okay  for that price  not bad at all</li>
    <li> Easily lathers, has helped reduce the amount of hair fallout and does not have an overly herby-smell! I cannot say that this product helped grow hair back, it is basically too soon and illogical to think that my hair will grow back with only a few uses, but it has helped reduce the breakage and fallout!</li>
    <li> very good product.  this is going to be my primary shampoo going forward.</li>
    <li> Product has a full lather and pleasant smell, unlike many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos.  I can&#x27;t say for sure it&#x27;s efficacy in regards to treating or slowing my receding hair line, but my hair does seem to look and feel thicker and fuller.  I&#x27;d fully recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Makes my head smell like cough drops. I guess that means it&#x27;s working... and I got a thing for cough drop smell anyway.</li>
    <li> I used this for almost a month before I had to stop using it due to an epic breakout of cystic acne along my hairline. I think I&#x27;m sensitive to some of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients. (soy isoflavones ?!?!) Long story short, it reduced shedding and added more volume to my hair. I&#x27;ve also noticed some baby hairs so it does stimulate regrowth. However, it dried my hair/scalp out so much that I don&#x27;t recommend using it as a daily shampoo. Not a total waste of money but it&#x27;s not my holy grail either. Having similar/better results with Nizoral.</li>
    <li> I am a sceptic when it comes to anything hair as I&#x27;ve had many many ups and downs with products, stylists, very expensive product, etc...Finding pura d&#x27;or hair loss shampoo was a good day in the life of my hair. So far, the hair is fuller, silkier, and lighter. Seems all styling products get removed completely. Not sure yet about hair regrowth but will update when I see results.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my mother because she was loosing her hair and since she started to use it her hair is looking fuller. She is very happy with the results that she is having, I am also going to start using. I recommend this product; however do not expect the results to be overnight. It takes time.</li>
    <li> I was going to write a review after the second time I used it because there were hardly any hairs in the shower - but like I said, I wanted to wait til I was sure it was actually working.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been a month now and I don&#x27;t find hair in the shower, or much in my brush these days, either. Also, I notice that my head isn&#x27;t as sensitive  - it used to hurt when I brushed it - I could feel the hair being pulled out. I cried every time I washed my hair to see 25-50 hairs in the shower and on me and then more still in the brush. What a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been taking supplements as well.. silica, biotin and ChlorOxygen(just started that one)... but I had been taking the supplements for about a month or so before I started the Pura d&#x27;or. So I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s ALL as a result of the shampoo but I&#x27;m inclined to think the results are because the shampoo is AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product - worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;tb&lt;br /&gt;DE</li>
    <li> The product was not too bad at first. It seemed to do the job, especially if I was still sweaty. It did not do well against all day grease in your hair, or not as well as regular shampoo but that was ok and to be expected. Where I really became disappointed was when the product congealed. I got a pump of mucus like product that would not rinse out of my hair. Since then it is all that consistency and unusable. Half the bottle was thrown out, which is kind of a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Product is great. Does exactly what is says. My hair looks thicker and healthier than ever. Definitely recommend for guys nervous about a thinning hair line.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair and scalp healthy and revived.</li>
    <li> Nice thick creamy shampoo. Smells great</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo.  I bought it because my hair seemed to be thinning.  I used Bosley for awhile but it started drying out my scalp.  Read that this + some head and shoulders (when your scalp is dry and itchy) works wonderfully and sure enough it does.  Highly recommended!  I like to wash my hair when I have put gel in it for the day, then wash it again and let it sit in my hair for a couple of minutes.  Had made my hair thicker, stronger, and healthier.  Have not noticed any further thinning.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as often as I should to know if this product works. Though when I did receive it, the first time I used it, yhe actual product didn&#x27;t have the right consistency, not sure if that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s suppose to be, but I wasn&#x27;t too into it. Not that excited to use either, it felt as if it was on the shelf too long and very gooey. It didn&#x27;t smell as good as I thought it would too and I like shampoos that will have thay clean and fresh smell.</li>
    <li> See no result , waste of money and time .</li>
    <li> Just started to use Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and will re-comment 3 months from now for an update.</li>
    <li> Made my hair fall out faster</li>
    <li> Seems to have reduced the amount of hair loss and also strengthened the hair and moisturized the scalp. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My wife was trying to find organic shampoo without any harsh chemicals, based on so many good reviews she bought this one, she has been just used it for once, she said it does leave her hair very soft than other normal shampoo. so far, she is happy. I will try it too soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for both its organic ingredients and hair growth claims. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to judge the latter, but I do like it. Seems to add a little volume, even though I follow it with a regulator moisturizing conditioner. I&#x27;ve had very short hair for several years and am planning to grow it back out to waist length. I personally enjoy the scent -- woodsy, musky.</li>
    <li> I waited a long time to write this review because I wanted to be sure that I gave this product a fair chance. In December 2014, I did the most ridiculous thing ever - I decided to cut my waist-length hair into a short bob. Biggest mistake ever! I&#x27;ve been trying desperately to grow it ever since. I only wash my hair every 2-3 days, and I only  use organic hair products. I never heat style. I have been using this shampoo since September (Yes! One bottle has lasted me since September (it&#x27;s now the end of February)! Another plus!). It cleanses excellently, but is gentle enough for my fine hair. I am happy to announce that my hair is almost halfway down my back just a year after my awful decision to cut! Sure, it&#x27;s not as long as I&#x27;d like, but even my stylist recently remarked, &amp;#34;Wow! Your hair grows fast!&amp;#34; The truth is, my hair doesn&#x27;t grow fast. It took many years to get it as long as it was before I cut. But, I can honestly say that my hair is growing super fast with this shampoo. I am also taking biotin and folic acid supplements, and using a hair growth conditioner. I think it&#x27;s a winning combo! I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago, because most shampoos exacerbate my hair problems by aggrevating my exzema, not this one. It smells amazing and feels good too, leaving my head feeling clean, the best part is it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, which passes the organic test!</li>
    <li> Hair feels thicker after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I use it for over a month now and don&#x27;t see any results. Good shampoo though, but did not help to improve hair loss condition. So it&#x27;s way too expensive for just a shampoo.. even an organic one.</li>
    <li> Will purchase again.  Light, fresh, spa-like scent.  Good value - lasted over 8 months at one pump daily.  Looking forward to trying some of their other products.</li>
    <li> Product is great.  Helping to thicken my hair.  Noticed results after 1st bottle</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing severe hair loss ever since I came to this country. It got me so worried. I have tried many different products but none of them seemed to work. Finally, with this one, I saw noticeable differences. I ll keep using it and see what happens.</li>
    <li> For this first time this product made my hair a little dry, but after a few days usage, it began to work fine on my hair and it seems I had less hair loss.</li>
    <li> Strengthens hairs, adds volume, makes hair feel thicker. Not a miracle shampoo to grow new hair, but good for improving upon thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this just looking at the rating. This shampoo caused too much of dandruff to me. Had to trash it off. Just used it twice and hated it.</li>
    <li> This one is the best one I&#x27;ve seen so far.it is a Dailey shampoos which makes your hair grow.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that really works! I was skeptical at first but after using for about a month and a half I can definitely tell a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with two others for 2 months now and the first thing I noticed was that I don&#x27;t lose as much hair in the shower.  I believe my hair is getting thicker by the day and is actually filling in around my hairline.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> My hair definitely  looks thicker after just one week&#x27;s use, and I noticed that there hasn&#x27;t been any hair in the tub&#x27;s drain. Definitely a good thing!</li>
    <li> I have now used this shampoo for the last 3 months and beyond satisfied with the results. My hair has stopped falling and I can actually see hair growth in areas where it was becoming noticeably thin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So far, the wife and I like the smell and the way it leaves our hair soft and smooth.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice item&lt;br /&gt;thank u very mucht</li>
    <li> I am not sure how this product got any good reviews... It is possibly the worst product I have ever used. It made my have heavy and dull and it felt like it had a thick film on it... I wish I could get my money back. I put it the garbage just so I wouldn&#x27;t use it on accident. Horrible&#x27;nn</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on reviews and I gave it a good review myself because I liked the way it made my hair feel. I don&#x27;t think it really starts growing hair from dead follicles but I do feel the follicles I have left are growing healthier hair than before and I seem to have stopped losing it. At least that is my own observation. Try it out.</li>
    <li> A pretty good shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t froth up like those other generic shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t have those harmful ingredients that creates the bubbles, so it&#x27;s not supposed to froth up that much. For myself, I don&#x27;t notice more hair growth, but I do notice that I&#x27;m not losing hair, so it&#x27;s maintaining the hair that&#x27;s already there, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite shampoo. A bit pricey for such a small bottle. But smells great and leaves my hair feeling a world of difference better than cheap shampoo.</li>
    <li> No harmful effects and should be safe. But there is no significant effect after use for 1 month.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it i lose more hair when i star using it</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I will definitely be buying this again! My hair come back!!!</li>
    <li> i like it, i have been using it for almost three weeks and can already see results. i would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> i using this shampoo about a month now .. well , so far its so good .. im also using minoxidil and biotin 10000mg ..&lt;br /&gt;give it a shot</li>
    <li> I found the  shampoo leaked when I receive  the goods</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a month and now my hair does look better and feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bit of time but I have noticed a difference. I leave it on for about 2 minutes before washing. Another bonus is that it smells good too! Overall, I would recommend this shampoo. I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> I have been patient using this shampoo for 5 months, since I saw good reviews even mainly the ingredient is not argan oil as titled but just coconut oil. But time to stop using it even bottle almost full, cause this product just left me with keep loosing my hair even more and more plus dandruff all over my head after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the great customer service they provide emailed me, apologized and return my money back.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo,  highly recommended. I have tried it for few months, and my hair stopped falling.  I will pay it again and recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Now I have used this product for 2 months. Initially I did not see any results but when reading the instructions you&#x27;ll need to keep the product staying in your hair for several minutes while showing, I started to follow the instruction. In recent two weeks I have noticed less hair loss than before. I will continue to test on this product.</li>
    <li> work great makes my hair feel thicker also noticed that hair loss has stopped or is significantly reduced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a known effect of the shampoo but my hair dries so much easier and faster. In combination with the conditioner my hair is definitely softer and feels fuller.</li>
    <li> great shampoo.  it certainly has stops although not eliminate hair loss.</li>
    <li> to me, not only couldn&#x27;t help to stop the hair loss, but also somehow aggravated that, I stopped using it and switched to another product which I feel more content with now...</li>
    <li> Absolutely without a doubt LOVE this shampoo. I noticed a difference the very first time I used it. After washing my hair, I always have a handful to pull from the drain. I lose a lot of hair! The very first time I tried pura d&#x27; or I went to pull the hair from the drain and there was hardly anything there! I was shocked. This has been the case every time I shampoo now. I notice a difference in the fullness of my hair as well. I have fine hair and it does not weigh your down in any way, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel dirty (like some other hair loss shampoos). This shampoo leaves your hair, soft and shiny with lots of body. It is absolutely amazing. The fact that it is made from natural ingredients is very important too. I have already told several people about the product. I will continue to be a customer for years to come.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and/or conditioner caused a serious rash on my scalp and neck, verified by my dermatologist. I used it for 3 weeks, and what started as a tingling on my scalp (&amp;#34;it&#x27;s working!&amp;#34;) was actually the beginning of a month&#x27;s-long rash that ultimately became infected. I&#x27;m vegetarian and in excellent health, but as the doctor was including &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;Or&amp;#34; in his notes, he said, &amp;#34;This shampoo may be &#x27;organic&#x27;, but then again, so is poison ivy!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely write reviews, but I felt obliged to warn potential customers.</li>
    <li> I cannot belive that from the first time I used this shampoo my hair stopped failing out in handfuls when I wash it. My husband noticed how nice my fine hair looked and he started using it and will not go back to his shampoo as it leaves his scalp so nice. Great product , works as it says it will. E&#x27;Lizabeth Way</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s less hair collected in the strainer after I shower, but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s actually a physical difference in how my hair looks in terms of body, volume, and thickness. It lathers well when hair is more wet. I do like that this shampoo is color safe and cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as described and smells great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve also bought this one and have honestly can  say that this shampoo worked! I have noticeably thicker hair with lots of baby hair in my temple area! It was a great buy and will be buying this product in the near future!</li>
    <li> Second time purchased</li>
    <li> Actually, weirdly... there&#x27;s no more hair in the drain after using this for ten days. It&#x27;s almost strange to look down and not see my man shedding anymore.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo for thin hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing!  I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like it,since I&#x27;ve tried so many others. It is well worth the price and the results are wonderful!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s more natural and organic. But does not make too much lather. Haven&#x27;t used it that long. Will provide update in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this in the stores, but decided to just think ahead and order from Amazon. From my experience, the smell wasn&#x27;t the greatest, but seems to be doing the job. Noticed less hair in the drain when I shower and leaves my hair soft. I use this typically to reduce thinning and maintain my hair as I don&#x27;t have a serious case of hair loss yet. So far so good!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I love how clean this product makes my scalp feel even after waiting a couple days between shampooing; usually this is a big issue for me.  The smell isn&#x27;t gorgeous - it&#x27;s a bit medicinal - but it&#x27;s far from bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels thick and healthy and looks really shiny.  This shampoo is a keeper for me - finally!</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for the better part of a year, and didn&#x27;t have much by way of results. I love the lather and smell, but my hairline kept right on marching back as the months went by. Everyone&#x27;s hair and scalp is different, and what works for one might not for others. I&#x27;d recommend it, and be willing to give it at least a 6 month test, but do check your progress as you go. Good shampoo, just not for me. Good luck</li>
    <li> Not bad but no new growth after seven months of use. Seems to be a mild shampoo light but good foaming hair does appear a bit fuller but no new growth noted after several months of use. Little goes a long way one and a half pushes on dispenser enough to do the job hair gets clean and not a bad smell but had hoped for some new hair growth...</li>
    <li> Great product! After using this shampoo for only 3 days I already noticed less hair falling out. In the past when I would shampoo my hair in the shower, I was use to seeing several of my hairs that have come off my head sitting my hands. While using this product that rarely happens anymore. Once my hair dries it looks thicker and fuller. Definitely would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I love the way this shampoo gently washes my hair.  I don&#x27;t know about it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hair loss prevention&amp;#34; properties, but I do know it is gentle on the scalp and hair.  I have turned to mostly organic products,  this shampoo fits the bill. The ingredients on the list can be pronounced (no weird chemicals).  A very good product, but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> It works ok. After using it, it makes your hair feel better than before. It also makes your hair smell awesome!</li>
    <li> Bought for my dad, and he really likes the product. He said the product feels really comfortable. Will continue buying this under my subscription.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very happy with the results. I noticed an improvement within 1 week!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few years now.  I BELIEVE it is helping.  It&#x27;s impossible to know for sure because I can&#x27;t clone myself and have that version of myself NOT use it.  But I believe it is helping retain some hair.  The price is a little high but I believe the value is actually tremendous because 1 bottle still lasts an entire year because it is quite concentrated and the pump releases a perfect amount each time.  The smell is good too.  I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair volume, but since I only used for few weeks, so I am not sure if it actually helps with hair growth.</li>
    <li> very good product. you need to have one in your home.you will not regret.</li>
    <li> Using this product for the past week. I would not classify it as a &amp;#34;hair growth&amp;#34; shampoo but it definitely is milder than other shampoos I have used. My hair does not feel as &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; after using this shampoo. I think this product may be effective for hair loss if it is combined with medication and medicated products. It is very expensive so might not be worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 3 months now and absolutely love it. At first I was skeptical because of all of the fake reviews, but this shampoo is great. The shampoo itself suds up very well compared to many other natural shampoos I have used in the past so I feel like my hair is actually getting cleaned. A key component to this shampoo is making sure you leave it in your hair for long enough! It says to leave it in for two minutes but I always try to leave it in much longer. I have truly noticed a decrease in hair loss and my hair feels much thicker. My boyfriend, who has premature hairloss, also swears by this shampoo. If you are experiencing hairloss, this shampoo is definitely worth a try and if you do decide to purchase, keep in mind you need to give it a couple months to see real results. At first I felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing anything, but two months later is when I started to notice the difference. I think it took a little while for my body to get used to the change in ingredients especially after using chemical-filled shampoo prior to this.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE. I never write reviews but this product is T E R R I B L E. It made me lose so much hair I feel like I am balding in some areas. I would like to give a round of applause to the hundreds of fake reviews that convinced me to buy this product. Pura D&#x27;or sure is sure going in with that marketing money. This product makes your hair feel so dry it&#x27;s unreal. Plus it smells horrible. Do not buy this product if you value your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks so far. My hair feels better. Dont know yet if it helps to prevent hair loss</li>
    <li> I have used it for 2 days now and it leaves my hair a little brittle but smells good and hair is manageable.</li>
    <li> This product has a much better smell than other comparable products on the market.  It does leave your hair a bit dry, so I would recommend a conditioner to use with it.  It does provide great volume to your hair even when combined with the lavender vanilla pura d&#x27;or conditioner.</li>
    <li> Recommend it to every one struggling with hair loss and thinning hair. It worked for me.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this!!! Her hair stops falling.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle, half of what I use generally (with other shampoo&#x27;s) provides the same results. I have long frizzy , curly hair. My bath tub used to be filled with hair and I could visibly see my hair thinning. I started using this shampoo seeing the great reviews for the past 4 months. The hair fall has reduced by about 75%. Another plus is this shampoo does not dry my scalp. I follow up the shampoo by applying Macroon oil to keep the shine and reduce frizz. Works great for me..</li>
    <li> Great product that leaves my hair soft and seems to help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with blonde curly hair.  I&#x27;m young, but the thought of hair loss has me acting proactively.  I bought this product after seeing all the miraculous reviews, and now believe I was duped.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it appears to be a decent argan shampoo.  It just doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  It makes my hair squeeky when wet and after drying it becomes frizzled and hard.  I usually don&#x27;t use conditioner, but it&#x27;s an absolute must if I put this Pura Shampoo in my hair.  --  The scent is meh, and it takes quite a bit to actually produce a lather.  I&#x27;m just going to use it real fast and purchase something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase a 34oz bottle of Viatress Biotin Shampoo for the same price.  I like it better.</li>
    <li> A noticeable difference. Hair looks a little bit thicker and I had a mild amount of regrowth. What more can you reasonably ask for? The trick to get a lot of lather is to apply after getting hair really wet then lightly rub on top of head. Very lightly. Don&#x27;t try to get shampoo in scalp. After 20 seconds or so of that, you&#x27;ll have tons of lather. I had an issue with this at first, but kept trying multiple methods. Now, I&#x27;m happy. And the shampoo smells great. It&#x27;s nearly odorless and the odor it keeps just smells clean.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is simply Wonderful. I liked the minty smell, the longevity of the usage, however i&#x27;m not certain if it prevented hair loss. After each wash i felt it gave my hair more volume, more life, but during each wash the same amount of hair would fall off. I know it is normal to loose 120 strands of hair each day, but it is scary to see (and i counted) 60 strands fall off during regular washes. Aside from this, Pura d&#x27;or is a great shampoo at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the marketing hype. This shampoo won&#x27;t grow you new hair or prevent hair loss (a genetic factor for the most part). However, the natural ingredients are gentler on the scalp. Any non-chemical shampoo would provide the same benefit for less money.</li>
    <li> I used &amp;#34;Head &amp; Shoulders 2 in 1 shampoo&amp;#34; for many years. I start noticing a significant amount hair loss during my hair routine. The amount is so great that I decided to try this product out. The product does work on me. I purchase both hair loss prevention shampoo and organic conditioner. After using the product a few times now, I can see the difference. Use only the shampoo; not with the conditioner though. For some reasons, their conditioner make my hair loss just like before so I just stop using the conditioner. I shampoo my hair daily. I guess the conditioning is just too much for my hair. I also like the fragrance of the shampoo. I will stay with this product until my hair grows in full volume.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance of this one, and I think it has effect for protecting my hair. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after noticing my hair was thinning and falling out quite a bit. From initial use I noticed less hair fall in the shower and in between my showering. My hair has been looking and feeling thicker and more voluminous. I have curly hair and I&#x27;ve also notice a lot less frizz and more shiny defined curls. Have been loving this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything it says it is.  I am very please with the outcome of my hair.</li>
    <li> Its a great product. I will suggest other to try this. I Had previously around 100-150 hair falls per day. Now after 4 weeks i can its 10-20. almost 90% of hair fall reduced. I loved this product. Gonna order more..... Suggest others to try it for a month and see the results!!! am 100 % sure you will find the difference....</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Used the first bottle for 4 months and found that my hair stopped to lose and improved a little bit. Will use another bottle to get more improvement.</li>
    <li> It is too soon to accurately access this hair-loss shampoo as I had been using another formula with cysteine, methionine, copper peptides, emu oil, from I believe DL Labs. Give it a little more time; incidently, I&#x27;ve had a difficult time getting the dispenser pump to pop-up, just turning it was not enough? Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Waited since September 2014 to make a review: So far nothing has changed. My hair still falls out, it&#x27;s dry as hell and it smells like potpourri or incense, which is kinda like a old smell that makes it look like I smoke.</li>
    <li> not much organic stuff in here...</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo I tried. It helps to stop balding. I don&#x27;t know about growth but it definitely stooped getting worse.</li>
    <li> My hair is thinner on the top and around the edges from years of pulling it back into ponytails. I bought this product because it had good reviews and great ingredients. I&#x27;m not sure if this product is working to regrow my hair, but I do notice that my hair is softer and healthier than it was before I began using this shampoo. Using it twice per day does not dry my hair or make it feel brittle. It is expensive, but since my hair is cut very short, I only use a dime size each shampoo. I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo.  I have been using it for about a week and am already noticing a difference.  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> It works well. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it was a miracle or it regrows anything back but since using it I have noticed that hair lose has been reduced greatly.  In general it is a decent product and I have noticed favorable results.</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller. Have been using this for a couple of weeks now and it seems to be helping a bit. Will let you know in a few weeks what changes I see.</li>
    <li> It made my hair much more manageable, soft, shiny and when I blow dried it with a round brush- it did seem fuller. SMELLS GREAT</li>
    <li> finally! a conditioner that along with the shampoo is really healing my hair :) since I started using, I can definitely see/feel the difference. my hair is not falling out anymore, it smells so good.. it&#x27;s incredible! so happy &amp; shipping was so fast.. I am just amazed overall. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a prescription hair loss prevention product for the past few years and just recently started using this product as well.  It is hard to confirm that it has made a significant difference but my gut feeling is telling me that my hair is thicker now.  I have also had two comments lately from close family members that my hair looks thicker.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> To my amazement my hair breakage all but stopped after the second week of using twice a week.  I DO follow the instructions and leave it on my hair for2 to 5 minutes. And I follow through with using the Conditioner as well. My hair NOTbeing all over the bathroom floor after combing was my first sign that this product has merrit!  I&#x27;ll continue to use it for that helpful effect if nothing else.</li>
    <li> This has worked really well for me and controlling dandruff. I mix it with my normal shampoo once or twice a week and the 16 oz bottle has lasted nearly 9 months at this rate. It is well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I alternate this shampoo with a prescription shampoo.  I have only been using it for about a month, so too soon to see any hair regrowth reesults, but it is lovely, thick shampoo that feels luxurious to use.  I will try to remember to update this in a few months.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells fantastic and looks like honey... It makes your hair feel strong and clean</li>
    <li> Cleans and lathers well. Does not dry out hair and leaves hair feeling soft. No harsh or strong chemicals. No parabens or sulfates.  Has a slight medicinal smell, but this smell does not linger after rinsing.</li>
    <li> It lathers well and the bottle really does last about 3 months. It didn&#x27;t make my hair grow faster. I bought two bottles and tried it for six months. No change.</li>
    <li> Great product! Saw quick noticeable results. Feels soft!</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this product 3 months ago, it seems to work that my hair loss has been reduced compared to the times when I was using other products. It has not produced absolute miracles, but thinning and lost hair seems to be growing back healthier and I feel that I can at least maintain whatever hair I have left. I will continue to use the product to see how it goes from here. So far, I am definitely satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I have used two bottles. I don&#x27;t think it has any influence on hair loss, but it does make your hair look and feel good just. It must have something to perm your hair a little bit to make you looks have more hair.</li>
    <li> Stuff is great!! My hair was thinning - 3 months later of using this awesome product and my hair is back!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to get away from the unnatural chemicals that are used in shampoos and to prevent frizzy hair, so my hairstylist recommended this shampoo and it has made my hair feel really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I also have thinning hair so I do not know if this actually prevents it. I read a few reviews from the internet and my stylist both have said I should continue to use it for at least six months to maybe see a difference. I will update at the six month mark. But to reiterate the reasons I got this shampoo was not because of my thinning hair but rather for its organic contents and that it does not make my hair frizzy anymore.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the BEST! I have suffered from an itchy scalp for half of my life and I recently started losing handfuls of hair by the day.  I worried that I would soon have no hair left at the rate it was falling out (scary thought for a woman.) So I started searching for a shampoo that claimed to prevent hair loss.  This was the first shampoo that I tried.  Within weeks of using this shampoo I noticed my scalp was itching less and I wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair as I was.  I have been using this shampoo for 7 weeks now and I would say that I&#x27;m back to shedding the average amount and my scalp itching has completely gone away.  My hair looks and feels more voluminous, like it has life again.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any major hair growth, but I&#x27;m not losing major amounts of hair anymore so I&#x27;m happy. YAY!  This shampoo is totally worth every dime spent.  It may seem pricey compared to the average drugstore shampoo, but trust me it is so worth it.  Just to give you an idea of how long a bottle could last you, I wash my hair every other day using 4 pumps on long hair and I&#x27;m not even half way though the bottle yet.  I see a bottle lasting me a good four months. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone!</li>
    <li> It has a medicine-like smell but no one has seemed to notice it in my hair after it dries. It lathers extremely well. I am a guy and only need 1 pump but I&#x27;m guessing a lady can get away with only 1 pump as well this stuff lathers so well. I can&#x27;t really speak to whether or not it is working at preventing hair loss but I will say my hair does have a nice fullness to it after using this product. It cleans well without leaving my hair greasy in a day which has happened to me with alot of over the counter brand name shampoos I have used.</li>
    <li> It is really useful~!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is just what I have been searching for!!! It actually works. Hair loss has slowed down tremendously and it smells great. So glad I could find something with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair, dry ends and it&#x27;s long to my elbows. I pump in to my hand at les 3 to 4 pumps to apply to my hair that is covered in water to build up a full lather. After my second day of use, my hair felt as soft as baby hair!! I don&#x27;t have that dry hay feeling on the ends anymore . I don&#x27;t see a Change in hair staying on my head but maybe I&#x27;ll notice a change in a month . I&#x27;ll keep you all posted.</li>
    <li> They promise you a free bottle if you write a nice review, after used the whole bottle my hair was even worse, by the way i did write a nice review the first week i got it , never get the free bottle ! Total scam, looks like they&#x27;re doing good, finding more victims and making more money.</li>
    <li> This is my first review on Amazon -  Pura d&#x27;or has been a fantastic product for me. I have baby fine hair and a very oily scalp that breaks out at the hairline. Tried all sorts of promising shampoos over a few years - next day it was just as oily as before. I have also suffered from hair loss since age 9 due to stress and genetics, so it&#x27;s been a long time struggle.. While doing some research online, I came across this shampoo and ordered it via Amazon. I have been using it for about 4-5 months now, and have found that the most efficient treatment for me has been to use Pura d&#x27;Or along with the OTC vitamin supplements recommended by my doctor. Combine those with hormonal treatment, my hair is growing back thicker and filling in the gaps, it&#x27;s much less oily and requires fewer washes, and my scalp does not break out anymore. I am now looking into a gluten-free diet as there are claims that gluten could be weakening the hair shaft and contributing to its shedding. That&#x27;s my next step - but Pura d&#x27;Or is a keeper.</li>
    <li> BEST Shampoo ever!!! I used to have major hair loss... I bought this shampoo after seeing that everyone kept writing good reviews. I can honestly say it does work. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks. Hair loss has lessened.</li>
    <li> I notice less shedding when I use this product. I don&#x27;t see much of a difference between this and the gold in the ingredient list except that the gold has plant based preservatives as opposed to the brown n blue shampoo which uses phenoxyethanol.  I love that this lathers well, smells nice, and leaves my hair feeling thoroughly clean.</li>
    <li> I have used regain for years with no improvement&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me about this shampoo and I tried it 4 months again and my hair looks thicker and fuller&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to used it&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s the best thing that I have used on my hair</li>
    <li> awesome shampoo. One pea size portion makes great amount of lather leaving the hair fresh and deeply clean. The lavender scent is not overpowering which is actually very relaxing. I am due to ordering another bottle. Great for both genders. I have thin hair and have noticed less shedding vs the previous shampoo brand. The back label listed only few but mostly organic familiar ingredients and one does not need to be a chemist to understand. Best of all, it is made in the USA and is NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair mostly falls off when I wash it. With this shampoo I lose only about 1/4 of hair I was losing before. I don&#x27;t need much shampoo for the whole head so the bottle will last a long, long time. I wish it would be produced in smaller volumes. I would rather buy less volume more often than more volume less often.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is a bit dense &amp; hard to spread through wet hair. I am not sure about hair growth yet as it hasn&#x27;t been long enough. Smell is ok</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and has an effective amount of Saw Palmetto (removes follicle-clogging DHT); the smell is quite nice, (light, herbal/peppermint), and it does a great job cleansing without leaving hair stiff and dry, or limp and still oily. Quality product, works well.</li>
    <li> It is not what I thought it would be like</li>
    <li> Definitely feels like cleans deeper into scalp and thickens hair a lot while washing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product one time but I really liked how rich the lather was. I&#x27;ve tried aveda for hairloss and it wouldn&#x27;t lather. The smell is nice. I will be back to update in a few weeks to let you know how effective it is for stopping my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Hair loss Prevention shampoo for nine months now.  And, I&#x27;m happy with the results. My hair loss has stopped or slowed down.  My scalp is no longer feeling itchy or a feeling of scalp tightness after a shower.  My hair feels better! I think that this shampoo has alot going for it.  No Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.  And, it has zinc to help with dandruff.  Plus it has a pleasant smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Minoxidil 5% daily treatment twice a day too.</li>
    <li> After finding out that I&#x27;m suffering from hair loss at a young age, I was extremely upset. My doctor recommended this shampoo to supplement my prescription shampoo and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ve noticed far less shedding over since I started using the shampoo and its really gentle on my hair. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product! I use it every other day and leave it on for ten minutes to let it penetrate the hair - highly recommend for those with hair loss. Thank you for this stuff!!</li>
    <li> At first when I purchased this product, I didn&#x27;t realize that it was for hair loss, since I was just looking for a highly rated Argan Oil product.  Since using it, I don&#x27;t think that I will ever use anything else!  Even my husband has not switched to using it, which is a big compliment.  It&#x27;s nice having to only buy 1 shampoo for the household.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo in every way! I had been using rogain for few months. Rogain really did grow hairs, but Due to sudden occurred strong scalp itching and redness allergic reaction I stopped using it. I was looking for something to help grow and anti loss hair production, I found it! Ever since I started to use this shampoo My hair no longer falling off when I shower or comb. Also it can give some volume to my hair, but not so much. I ordered 2 more for my mom. Hope it helps with her fining hair.</li>
    <li> I really love the shampoo and conditioner. I used them every day and my hair looks fuller and shiny. I usually wash my hair at night but my hair doesn’t feel oily next day!!! Also, the shampoo smell is not strong and actually it smells fresh to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says the shampoo and conditioner are 100% organic and cruelty free!!! I love Cruelty free!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to use them a little longer to check hair loss but so far my hair loss decrease compared to using chemical shampoo. I love the shampoo and conditioner and I will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> A short while ago, I seemed to be shedding hair at a moderate rate. After starting on this product, I do feel as though my shedding has greatly reduced, if not stopped altogether. It lathers well, leaves my hair feeling great, and a half-pump generally works for my short hair. It is obviously more expensive than standard shampoo, but generally I am pleased. Give it a shot and see what you think!</li>
    <li> Pretty good shampoo and a decent value. I&#x27;ve noticed lately that I&#x27;ve started to thin on top of my head and decided to try this shampoo to hopefully slow the process. This product lathers nicely and the smell is inoffensive. I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells great or awful but it won&#x27;t appeal to everyone. I&#x27;ve noticed less hair in the sink so I&#x27;m hopeful that it&#x27;s working.  While not inexpensive, this costs less than most hair loss shampoos and you get a decent 16oz size of it. I&#x27;m happy with it so far but  I&#x27;ll need a few more weeks to make a better determination if it&#x27;s really helping my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 3-4 weeks. I have lost a lot of hair due to stress.  I will say that the shampoo has helped as l don&#x27;t shed so much hair lately. I can&#x27;t use it exclusively because it dries out my scalp causing it to flake and itch...even though l use a deep moisturizing conditioner. I will continue to use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I order this product because I found I lost a lot of hair while I wash it, but then I used it for the first time, I found my hair is not as dry as it was, more shiny, after I used it for the 3rd time, I believe my hair dropped less.  I will continuous to use it, I can see it does make a different compare to regular shampoo.  It is worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo about 2 months ago and I wanted to give it some time before writing a review on it. The amount of compliments I get on my hair can tell what a difference this shampoo made. It defiantly makes your hair softer and shinier. I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with hair loss but I can say that it has been reduced. I use other shampoos every other wash but I can still see the effect of this one so in case it is too expensive for you you don&#x27;t have to use it every single time that you wash your hair. It is a product that you are going to get addicted to and it will become one of the essentials in your shower so do not try it if you are not willing to spend the money on it cause one you get it you can not quit. love it and will definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Have only had this product for a week.  Will return with a review when I see if it works.&lt;br /&gt;At this time all I can say is it is organic and cleans hair nicely.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the new formula at all.  It&#x27;s watery, doesn&#x27;t smell as good and doesn&#x27;t lather very well.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than the original formula either.  I find that I have to use 3 to 4 times as much just to get a good lather.  Will not be purchasing this product anymore.</li>
    <li> Got it 2 weeks ago and I feel like my hair is healthier and stronger. Great product so far, love the natural ingredients vs all the chemicals in hair loss products I&#x27;ve used in the past. Will update in a couple of months!</li>
    <li> terrible! broke my scalp out!</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t need saving but I am allergic to most shampoos. This leaves my hair clean and shiny, and does not cause my scalp to be unhappy. The fragrance while on my hair is not wonderful, but rinses out scent-free.</li>
    <li> I have a dry scalp from this shampoo and have been getting dandruff for the first time in my life. I will never use this stuff again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still losing hair.</li>
    <li> My mom started losing hair from 1 year ago. One of my friends recommended this shampoo to me. I bought it 3 months ago and I didn&#x27;t review it till my mom finished the whole bottle and told me her feeling from this shampoo. The answer is YES! IT WORKS! It is expensive but worth it. My mom told me her hair stop losing and getting thicker. Also the hair is getting stronger. Definitely I will buy it again for my mom.!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great. Just hit,y 30s and noticed a lot of hair falling out. Saw the great reviews online and decided to try. Lovely smell in the hair. Soft and silky. So far so good!</li>
    <li> It dries my scalp worse than any shampoo I have ever used</li>
    <li> This is okay as a sulfate free shampoo it smells nice. I&#x27;ve been using it a while and haven&#x27;t noticed a change in hair fall, but I also don&#x27;t know the reason for my hair fall.</li>
    <li> I really like the silky smoothness that the shampoo leaves my hair with no residue build up.  I have not noticed any hair growth or reduced hair loss but have noticed a significant decrease in the scalp tingling that usually goes with my hair loss and SLS containing shampoos.  I am optimistic and will be switching to this product.  My favorite was the Daniel Rogers products but they were sued out of business for false claims - maybe the claims weren&#x27;t proven but it was a very good shampoo and scalp conditioner</li>
    <li> Had no impact on hair loss but also did not clean my hair effectively.  Made my hair feel yukky and flat.</li>
    <li> Great Product. It is very cost effective if used conservatively and it lathers very well for being sulfate free. Combining this shampoo with the Pura d&#x27;or conditioner has eliminated my dry scalp even in these cold winter months. After 1 month of dedicated use, my head and hair just feel and look healthier and I can look at the ingredient list and see why.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works and smells good, like normal shampoo does.  But the claim of regrowing hair is a far stretch, pretty much just cleans hair.  I&#x27;ve used caffienated shampoo and works great for hair regrowth.  They should re-brand this as just organic shampoo.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo.  I notice that I don&#x27;t loose as much hair while I&#x27;m in the shower which is a plus.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I feel my hair gets more greasy when using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Its ok but nothing like all the review suggested. It made my hair super dry, so I stopped using it. I cannot wait to see the effect for long term and I was losing hair too because of the dryness.</li>
    <li> I decided to order it due to my hairloss problem. I suffer from androgenic alopecia and I was losing a LOT of hair. This shampoo, really made a difference! My hair looks a lot thicker, with extra volume and very shiny and soft. It also reduced my hair loss. I&#x27; m about to order a new bottle.</li>
    <li> Seems to get hair clean, which is the main goal of shampoo, right? As far as preventing hair loss, it&#x27;s really hard to tell without knowing what it would look like if I hadn&#x27;t used this shampoo. I&#x27;m still loosing hair but it seems to be at a slower rate. Will try another bottle but might try something different if hair loss continues.</li>
    <li> I think this thing works for my hair in reducing greasing feeling. The loss prevention part I&#x27;m not very sure, but it seems to be better than my Pen-tine shampoo. However, it produces more flakes from my head.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this shampoo is a little bit strange, like some kinds of herb. So you will not smell like perfect by using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t use this for long, so if anything new, I will try to update</li>
    <li> I bought this product like 3 weeks ago while I was having bad hair days. I have  sensitive face and scalp skin and I was losing hair since 2006 (on and off). This time it was worst and I was kinda almost bald. So, I was looking for a good product with reasonable price. I am prime member and  noticed that this product is a best seller. So, purchased one and used like 2/3 days a week in last three week while I am taking some Biotin supplements and careful with hair conditioning. It worked so amazing that I can&#x27;t even believe it that my hair loss stopped. Thats why I thought that I should write a review as I am feeling grateful to this product. Completely satisfied with this product and I think you will love too.</li>
    <li> Decided to give it a try since I have gray hair. Used it for few days, and the hair is getting better, but not sure if it helps with gray hair.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It smells &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; so not bad but not great. I find I definitely need conditioner. It suds a little and while I can&#x27;t really attest to hair growth, it cleans very well. I wear scalp cover which is usually difficult to wash out. This cleans my hair and scalp easily.  I feel it leaves my hair shiny and in good condition. I would reorder.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo so far.. No complaints!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me :( I just finished the bottle and do not see any results. My hair keeps falling :(((</li>
    <li> seems to work, smells good</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo for hair loss.results can bee seen after a month usage.</li>
    <li> This is like the never ending bottle of shampoo.  I thought maybe my wife was adding to it.  It lasts a long time.  I like how it seems to clean with just one shampoo.  Thanks for the fast shipping and great packaging too.</li>
    <li> Eventually, this product strips away any moisture on your hair, leaving your hair brittle and easily succumb to hair loss.  My hair color is also being stripped and looking duller than ever.  I do not recommend it at all.  All the rave reviews should be read with caution.</li>
    <li> I order based on positive reviews, but it seems it doesn&#x27;t really help the hair loss or hair thinning but make it worse, my hair loss got worse since I use this product, honestly I do not recommend based on my experience !</li>
    <li> dried out my hair and scalp</li>
    <li> This product really does work I&#x27;m seeing hair where there was no hair I&#x27;m supper happy and I&#x27;m getting compliments</li>
    <li> Not satisfied at all. I will not buy again. It didn&#x27;t help at all with the hair loss or regrowth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no miracle cure hair growth formula.  I used only one bottle so maybe it has to be used for much longer before results can be observed.  I switched to a shampoo that I didn&#x27;t have to leave in my hair for several minutes and my hair looks and feels just as good if not better than when I used this product.  Does it work?  I can&#x27;t say for sure, but neither can I say that it doesn&#x27;t work.  I can say that I saw no difference whatsoever during my use.</li>
    <li> I am 20 years old and have been suffering from hairloss from suspected hormonal issues. This definately helps with shedding. Not sure if there has been a substantial amount of hair growing but It definately helps. I haven&#x27;t seem anything drastic yet so I am giving 3 stars</li>
    <li> Great product! Hair loss stops!</li>
    <li> This is my first time to buy this product. The shampoo has been used half bottle. I want to say the hair loss get controlled. Every time wash just a few hair loss.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo with no sulfates and harsh chemicals to cause loss of hair.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo, I see less hair loss.  Also, there is lots of new growth, and hair is easy to control without any conditioner.  Will keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> Like the smell. My hair feels better after using it, and it seems to strengthen the hair and give a better appearance. Simply like it!</li>
    <li> Really like the shampoo, first time using it...</li>
    <li> My hair and scalp feels squeaky when lathering this shampoo on my head, but after hair is dry it looks awful: no body, no volume, very flat, and I think I lost more hair than before during the week I was trying it. Those problems disappeared as soon as I switched back to my old shampoo, so I think it had everything to do with this new shampoo. Too bad, I had to return it. Not for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it that much and feel like my hair is coming off more easily. Esp when I pull my hair a little a lot of hair comes off.</li>
    <li> It is works for me. I just use it like 3 to 4 time so far. it is help to prevent hair loss. And Id like to keep use it. I hope my review can help you guys to consider about it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Great service! Amazing seller! A++++ 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Shampoo and the matching conditioner originally based off of reviews. After using it now for over a month, this stuff is amazing! I can&#x27;t speak to the claims of hair loss prevention as that is not the reason I bought it nor do I have that issue. However, the three things that I really noticed after about a week of using this product are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My scalp no longer itches! Prior to using this my scalp used to constantly itch and I was using some pretty good product before this.&lt;br /&gt;2. Dandruff is gone! I&#x27;m not sure if this product is supposed to control dandruff but it keeps it away from my hair!&lt;br /&gt;3. Hair feels like hair should! The products I&#x27;ve used in the past made my hair feel like something artificial. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but Pura d&#x27;or leaves your hair feeling like hair! Maybe I&#x27;m old fashioned but I don&#x27;t want my hair feeling like a silk worm or like I just dumped a gallon of wax on it!</li>
    <li> Good results after two days. I stopped losing hair. Go for it.</li>
    <li> Best hair loss prevention shampoo I&#x27;ve used by far!!! And I have used many, trust me. And the best part? It&#x27;s organic. My hair feels so much fuller ever since I started using it. And the smell is amazing. Will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> start to try, looking forward.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good. I like it and use it every day.</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo for about 3 weeks. So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results. It definitely adds a lot of volume, body and depth to my head of hair. The smell is nice. I think I&#x27;m beginning to see a little hair growth and I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in my typical hair loss.</li>
    <li> My wife was complaining about her hair falling out, so I bought her this shampoo and same kind conditioner . She now wants more of this stuff cause she says it works , her hair stopped falling out and instead new ones are growing.</li>
    <li> good ingredients, over priced, did not get any significant thickening ... lots of reviews look fake</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;she has thin, weak, and hair loss problem. She tried various product before this ( including organic shampoo) and result was unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon received she immediately tried and after couple week she is very satisfied !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this Shampoo WORKS! as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different natural shampoos and this one is my favorite so far! Many of the others that I&#x27;ve tried have left my hair dry, but not this one. The balance seemed to be just right to where it cleanses without completely stripping the hair. Also, based on the ingredient list, I feel comfortable using it with my infant and toddler and they like how it suds up! It did help a little with my toddler&#x27;s cradle cap which was amazing for a truly natural product!</li>
    <li> i do not hate it but i don&#x27;t know if i would say that i absoultely love it yet. I have been using it for about 2 months</li>
    <li> I purchased this on Nov 1 &amp; started using it as soon as I received it a few days later.  I got my hair cut on Dec 19, &amp; my hair dresser said I had many new hairs growing in, almost an inch long each.  I&#x27;m estatic.  I had been using Nioxin, which I&#x27;ve had good luck with in the past, but their products were just making my hair worse. I also purchased the Gold Label Pura D&#x27;Or on Dec 7 and have been using it along with this, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been long enough for that one to have helped in 12 days.  I&#x27;ve been using a pump of both since I use enough styling products in my hair to require 2 pumps of shampoo to get it clean.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love what this does for my hair. - brilliant shine, a great smell and a reduction of hair down the drain. It does not fade my color either. I was concerned about the argan oil content weighing down my fine thinning hair but have had no such problems. It is moisturizing but rinses clear.&lt;br /&gt;I wash only 2-3 times a week and use a conditioning cleanser on other days so this bottle is lasting me a very long time. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am experiencing post menopausal hair loss and have been using this in conjunction with OTC Rogaine. I cannot attribute the redcution in hair loss to any one particular item but the combination is working wonders. I am losing less hair. I would use it even if I wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;follically challenged&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Immediate results!  I&#x27;ve never used a shampoo which was so effective.  My hair feels thick and more manageable. Get this!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this stuff works. I am still shedding hair. It smells weird also. I do not like this shampoo. It dries out my scalp. I am almost out of this and i just ordered Formula 500 shampoo and conditioner. I am waiting for that to arrive. I had a hair transplant about two years ago by the hair club. They did a pretty good job. Not the density i was expecting. I will say their post op treatment worked better than any junk i got on amazon or walmart. It&#x27;s expensive so i can&#x27;t afford to stay with that treatment but it worked awesome at restoring my crown area. Every month i got 1 bottle of their proprietary shampoo, 1 conditioner, 1 scalp cleanser , 1 bottle of minoxidil and 1 bottle of vitamins. Their stuff truly was amazing and i have been trying hard to find a similar product ever since. I remember seeing 2 ingredients on the hair club shampoo. Peppermint oil and horsetail nettle. I wish i saved a bottle. Anyway, formula 500 has these two ingredients so we will see how that does.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo because the over all good review. shipping is fast. I used for while, is not work for me, my hair even loss more. I have to stop use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a nice organic shampoo to use. I feel Lille this shampoo was too watery so it doesn&#x27;t spread all over my scalp and hair when I put it on.</li>
    <li> I love beautiful hair and never wanted to be a bald headed guy! I was quite anxious about my hair as I was drastically losing my hair. There were a couple of bald spots and I started to use hats finding no alternatives. Actually, wearing hats all the time was probably the worst experience of my life. But, I didn&#x27;t continue it for a long time. I got a great solution for getting back my dark and curly hair. Do you know what is it? Well, a wonderful shampoo which is Pura d&#x27;or premium organic shampoo! An awesome product.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and read the reviews.  They generally recommended it, so I spent the extra amount and purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;Six weeks later, and it seems to have made no difference...my hair still falls out when I wash it, and at a lot of other times as well.  I still have a thinning hairline...not so fun since I am female.&lt;br /&gt;I did think for one week it was working...and that was a week when i washed my hair three times.  But I hate how my hair feels with frequent washing...it just gets greasy much faster. (I usually wash two times a week.) So if washing my hair every other day is how this stuff works, forget about it. This is me bending over backwards to be fair...since I am not sure if that more frequent washing would make it work.&lt;br /&gt;There may be a solution to thinning hair...this shampoo is not it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that my hair looks any better than it did, but I like the smell and the lather.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an organic shampoo that claims to assist in hair loss.  Yet, more hair is removed after each shampoo.  I&#x27;ve stopped using it.  I need more hair on my head...not less!!</li>
    <li> I believe this product did help to prevent hair loss, but the only thing bothered me is it does not help to remove dandruff.</li>
    <li> I switched to this product from the phytoworx shampoo because it was better priced and had great reviews. Sadly I was one of those people who did not have a great experience.&lt;br /&gt;-The good-&lt;br /&gt;The product lathers great and has a decent fragrance to it. It washes your hair well.&lt;br /&gt;-The bad-&lt;br /&gt;It made me break out. My skin doesn&#x27;t do well with products that has oils in it,  so if you are the same avoid this product. It also hurt my scalp a little because I think that just like my face it was clogging pores on my head. My hair actually grew noticeably thinner using this, which is probably because my scalp wasn&#x27;t happy. It wasn&#x27;t a great moisturizer but not the worst I&#x27;ve ever used (Nioxin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would not recommend this shampoo. I&#x27;ve switched back to phytoworx and I&#x27;ve never been happier.</li>
    <li> I am not sure whether it works or not due to the preventing hair loss is not significant enough. Regarding the seller where I purchased this product is excellent</li>
    <li> it seems that actually works</li>
    <li> Loving it.. has improved my hair immediately.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.It&#x27;s mild, I can use it on a daily basis and I noticed I don&#x27;t need conditioner anymore.It makes my hair  look shiny and healthy.I keep it on my scalp for 3-4 min and then rinse.I like the fact it&#x27;s all natural,no toxins and chemicals in it.Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have likely inherited my father’s crap genes - at age 41 my hair is thinning.  I also like drinking beer - probably didn&#x27;t get that from my mum.  I was using shampoo purchased at the grocery store - cheap rubbish - I believe this was not helping.  I see a lot of comments on the price - I&#x27;ve just finished my bottle - it lasted a very long time (5-6 months).  I believe it&#x27;s helping - my thinning hasn&#x27;t gotten worse.  It smells great - unique and classy.  A small amount goes a long way.  Sometimes I do have some dandruff issues - stress from work, also likely from another product I apply twice a day.  I also purchased the anti-dandruff shampoo from same manufacture.  I&#x27;m very happy with both.</li>
    <li> This product is not the same since the last time I purchased. I should have returned it right away, but was lazy about it. Product feels slimy, does not foam up and leaves hair feeling greasy and flat! Save your money and order from the product website- I think this formula is a bad batch.</li>
    <li> While I can&#x27;t tell if any hair has begun to regrow, I&#x27;ve noticed there is no more hair in the drain after I shower. This leaves my hair thick, full, and is very gentle. I have noticed my hair is not dry and brittle like it used to be. I like the concentrated formula as a little bit provides plenty of lather and a bottle lasts a very long time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and buying it from amazon is the best very fast shipping. The Pura d hair Loss works great. Makes my hair fuller and thicker. I felt like I was losing my hair and with this product The hair loss has stopped. Thank you. I had Sunday delivery with was great because I was running very low.</li>
    <li> everybody said it great and i bought it then find it is great!</li>
    <li> After the first few uses of this shampoo I noticed that my hair was significantly softer. This was a nice added benefit to the hair loss prevention. I have been using this product for a few months now and have noticed that my hair is significantly fuller and my receding hair line is much less noticeable. I like that the ingredients are all natural and the shampoo leaves a gentle smell of rosemary in my hair. Truly a great product, I would love to try the gold bottle and see what comparisons I can make.</li>
    <li> After using another very popular anti hair loss product for several years, I found out that they changed their formula and it was no better than any other drug store shampoo.  After researching on line, I discovered Pura d&#x27;or and decided to try it.  I have been using it for about 6 months now.  It is a great product.  It seems to do a great job in preventing hair loss and leaves your hair soft. The scent is very nice too.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I brought the brown before and recently brought the Pura d&#x27;or Blue for my son, he loves it, He told that his fall hair is significantly reduced&lt;br /&gt;and wanted another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect to hear from him as he has tried various shampoos and was always complaining of hair loss. Great product, give it a try and you will see results after continued use.</li>
    <li> Shampoo ok but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for really long hair or curly.</li>
    <li> JUNK. Everyone body is different so expect different results but I have used Nioxin, John Masters...you name it. Nioxin worked better than this and that didn&#x27;t even work well for me. Pura seems to thin out my hair MORE than other shampoos, and gives me itchy spots all day. 2 stars because it actually cleans my hair.</li>
    <li> I have loved this product! It worked the best after using it for 3 months. Every month that went by I noticed less and less hair coming out in my brush. Also I noticed my hair growing back in the patches where I noticed my scalp was showing. Just a little though. Mainly I want to prevent more hair loss and this definitely is perfect for that. I will continue to use this for a very long time. I also didn&#x27;t have to use a ton which normally I feel like I did with other products I used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo almost every other day for at least two months, but it still has one third left. The quality is good, and I feel that my hair volume has been slightly increased. I still lose several hairs after hair washing, but the loss is within a normal range. If it increases more hair volume after I use up this bottle, I will consider to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I tell you guys this is the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves my hair very flat and greasy at the scalp and yet very dry and waxy at the ends, (and yes I rinsed well and used conditioner at the ends). People have been asking me if I cut my hair, why my hair is so frizzy, why my hair looks so bad. The answer, sadly, is this product. It also gave me painful pimples on my scalp and back. I am a legitimate amazon customer with hundreds of real product reviews and I have no hidden agenda. I gave this product a full month of testing and I wash about every other day, sometimes daily. This shampoo in my opinion does nothing to help hair loss and causes more hair loss due to irritation of my scalp (as evidenced by noticeably more hair fall both in and out of the shower as well as causing scalp acne). Additionally, this also leaves hair quite unmanageable and tangly, even with deep conditioner afterwards. I would never recommend to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> What an outstanding shampoo! It smells great.  It actually works!!! The fine baby hairs around the forehead re-appeared and it helped thicken up the thinner looking hair framing my face.  It&#x27;s not a miracle like a hair transplant would be, but there&#x27;s noticeable continuous re-growth of new hair.  I only use once per week the shampoo &amp; conditioner combo.</li>
    <li> It seems people are a little on the fence about how effective this is as a hair restoration/baldness prevention option.  I can absolutely vouch for it working.  I have noticed significantly less hair in the shower after washing it and it definitely does feel nice and smell nice and fresh after a wash.  I couple mine with a thickening shampoo that is also dandruff control.  At the very least, it&#x27;s a good shampoo product and it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
    <li> love the shampoo, i&#x27;ve got oil and thin hair. normally i have to wash every morning to keep my hair fresh for whole day. Cause if i wash at night, after 8 hrs sleep, my hair will be greasy or flat again. but after I use this shampoo, i&#x27;ve tried it at night, next morning, my hair still fresh and not flat! not sure about hair loss prevention part. maybe after i use the whole bottle i will come back for another review.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews. However if you have dry curly hair, I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Used it for a month, I don&#x27;t think it help stop the hair loss at all. The shampoo lather up nicely, leaves a clean feeling,  and not too strong that makes the hair dry even if you don&#x27;t use conditioner. If it&#x27;s only act as a regular shampoo, it&#x27;s too steep for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> After using it for several months, it seems that the speed of hair loss slows down a little bit, but not fully stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this product is very gentle and never cause any allergy. I feel that It is better than other shampoo that I have used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month and really enjoy it . Really nice product, good for hair loss prevention, see improvements after one month</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo after shedding like crazy. I have long hair and seeing it falling off my head is like pulling my teeth. Its been a few weeks after using this product and i notice a significant reduction in the amount of hair falling off while washing it. At the time when I started using this product, I also stopped completely using any chemical-loaded hair care products. My conditioner is natural carrier oils which I mix with 6 kinds and leave it in my hair for like an hour before washing it. So far, it works, my hair is pretty tangle free and shiny and most importantly I shed less. Can&#x27;t pinpoint if it is the shampoo or oils or the fact that i don&#x27;t poison my hair any more. Nevertheless, it helps me with hair loss. It WILL be the only shampoo i will use from now on,....</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! My hair has never looked so beautiful and I&#x27;m dead serious, I will never switch shampoos again! I have suffered from premature hair loss since my early twenties and this is the first time in 10 yrs my hair is not falling out in clumps. Beautiful, shiny, full looking hair, and smells great too. Highly recommended! Love the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t clean your hair. It smells bad and worsens itchiness. My scalp itches so much from using this product. You could get much better shampoos at drug stores for much cheap prices.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this shampoo again. NEVER.</li>
    <li> The result was very good. Barely any hair loss and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my hair better but i don&#x27;t see a huge difference. My hair became more dry and my head was a bit scrappy. But it definitely help in stopping the hair loss that i was having before using this shampoo. I definitely recommend to try it out once. I am going to try it again and see if it helps my hair improve.</li>
    <li> it really works and it does exactly what it claims it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keeps the hair you have, maybe even regrows it a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and argon oil makes it as soft as ever.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about ten months now and in combination with the regimen I&#x27;m following it seems to be working. Hair loss has definitely reduced but I&#x27;m not sure if any hair growth has occurred yet. If nothing else, it&#x27;s SLS free so I&#x27;m not putting any chemicals in my hair - better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and so I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I had worst experience with this product and lost a lot of hair just by using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Those positive reviews are total bs, my friendly advise: do not risk - you will loose your hair!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband because he was shedding non stop and his bald spot was getting bigger. This seems to be making his hair thicker andhe shed&#x27;s less now. Yay!</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo. It makes my hair feel thicker, cleaner and stopped the itching.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a few weeks, but it seems good so far. I think my hair isn&#x27;t falling out as often, and it makes it very soft. I have wavy long hair for reference and genetic predisposition to thinning hair at the top of my head.</li>
    <li> It is not for me.  I have a lot of hair fallen out when I use this product.  It is just not for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month and now this is my second month using it. My hair has grown 4in in the last 3 months. I was losing a whole lot of hair before using this product, but now I have noticed that I have not lost as many strands, I probably lose a couple a day, which is normal. I do use other products such as coconut oil, almond oil, and peppermint oil in my hair throughout the week and this shampoo has the ability to lather it out, unlike most organic products. I also drink multivitamins and biotin pills. I also juice for breakfast with greens and fruits. I wash my hair 3 times a week and I avoid washing my hair with hot water. I try to wash my hair solely with cold water. I also do not condition my scalp. So all these factors could be  reasons why my hair has grown rapidly. I do upside down scalp massages as well. I also avoiding tying my hair up and if I do its only for specific tasks to be completed where I have to have my hair up, such as exercise, cleaning, Chem labs, certain tasks at work, etc. I recently added onion into my shampoo so hopefully that helps with regrowth. I am also a 20yr/F, so that can also be a factor. Thanks for reading, hope this helps out!</li>
    <li> No fuss product that works. Although hair loss has not been a major problem for me recently, i can tell that after a week of use my hair and scalp responded to this product well. Just feel natural and healthy.</li>
    <li> I am currently on my second bottle of Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo.  I have been using it for the past 6 months.  I saw results after only 2 weeks of using it about 4-5 times a week.  I saw significant  decrease in shedding.  I went from loosing 30+ hairs to maybe only 10 after washing.  I do follow up each time with the conditioner (lavender and vanilla scent).  While it doesn&#x27;t lather really well, I know sulfate free shampoos will not.  It gets rid of the oils in the hair and leaves no build up.  I don&#x27;t use hair products after washing other than argan oil, morroccan oil, coconut oil or (Aveda product with ) Brutii oil so I can&#x27;t say if it would clean other hair products in just one wash.  I use about 3 -4 pumps for my underarm length hair.  I leaves my hair a bit dry but that is why I follow up with oils after I wash.  There is minimal scent to the shampoo, and it is clear (a youtube reviewer showed his which squirted out kind of opaque but mine is totally clear.  The color difference could be due to the natural products used in the shampoo which can appear different due to harvest.)  I will continue to use this because it has proven to work for me.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so much healthier and looks amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It actually cleans your hair without leaving it feeling heavy and flat like alot of natural shampoos do. In the 2 months I&#x27;ve had it. I have a ton of new hairs coming in and it&#x27;s grown about 3 in.!</li>
    <li> using this one for about 3 weeks!!!My hair grew fast!</li>
    <li> I have some family history of early balding, so I preempted the inevitable by using DHT blocking shampoo. Originally that was Nioxin but after they sold out to Proctor &amp; Gamble (or whoever), I heard they cheapened the formula. I heard about Pura d&#x27;or and made the switch. It&#x27;s got a very nice feel, and I&#x27;m not bald yet.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is by far the best product I have ever used! I was a little skeptical at first but after reading the other reviews I decided to give it a whirl. My hair has grown back softer and more manageable. I had a hair appointment last week for a cut and color and my stylist whom I have been going to for years even noticed. Glad I found and I&#x27;m actually making another purchase right now!</li>
    <li> Very impressive!!! I did not expect a significant change with this price. But I decided to just give it a shot since all the other &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; products did not work for me. It surprised me!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! I bought this because of it&#x27;s natural ingredients and I read somewhere that it would help my hair grow faster. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s growing fast but my scalp feels healthier and hair looks thicker.</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo, but what&#x27;s the difference between the blue and gold label?</li>
    <li> Honestly fought buying any kind of hair loss products but I finally reached that point where I was always wearing hats, we&#x27;ll I can tell you I went to an extreme to test this product I wanted to see how effective it was so I shaved my head before using...... On that note never again and I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t have pictures but it works I have still after a month and a half of use new growth and as where before I was embarrassed now I&#x27;m letting everyone rub my head ha ha no joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me clarify why I shaved my head, I wanted to see if more hair followed after the first couple weeks and this was the best way to judge length but Unexpected was the thickness that would come back to my hair and still I have little tinny hairs growing where it was scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost a month for now. I&#x27;ve seen considerably reduced number of hair follicles in my bath tub. I feel fresh after using it and also it is odorless which I like. Also feels good for using shampoo without chemicals. 4 stars is because it did not see miracles yet like other reviewers said. Will update after few months again.</li>
    <li> It has been over 3 months, I am still liking this product, my hair is fuller, and my thinner areas have gotten more hair.  I will stick with this product. At times I would try my old shampoo and was not happy with it. I am liking the organic part all scalp acne is gone.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any difference but I will check back in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I have been having hair trouble ever since my kids were born, I guess due to hormonal swings, although no one has been able to measure any abnormalities, or give me a good answer as to what was going on. I am very particular about my hair, it is curly and thin to begin with. So, I use all organic, and try the natural things. This shampoo was probably the only one that I have felt that made any difference in my hair, it slowed the hair loss. Also, it leaves my scalp very clean and it smells fresh, almost like pine trees after rain. I do need to use a conditioner with it, because otherwise I would not be able to brush my hair out. And this maybe the only disadvantage and hence 4 star review.</li>
    <li> Its Not Works Don&#x27;t Buy West Money</li>
    <li> Love it! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else! It gets a great lather, really cleans and nourishes your scalp without over drying your hair. I barely have to use conditioner! Wonderful smell, and a little goes a long way, so it lasts a long time. Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much decrease in hair loss, but I have definitely noticed that my hair is softer and less frizzy. I have been using it for a couple of months now and keep it on for the amount of time directed.</li>
    <li> Within a month I noticed a big difference in my hair texture, body and much less hair loss.  I WILL buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is my forth bottle of Pura d&#x27;or and it continues to work. I only notice hair loss when I run out and am waiting for the next bottle to arrive. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for about a month and this is my second time using it (first time buying through amazon). Excellent shampoo leave hair soft and conditioned. you can see the results in about a week. Makes hair thicker and shinier. My hair had gone thin because of shampoos and blow drier. But this shampoo as claims reverse the thinning process. Also it is good to prevent further hair loss. Loved the shipping by Amazon got it is 2 days.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic, so much so that I recommend it to people who are not having a fight with their follicular genetics! Clean finish! Hope to see Pura D&#x27;Or Shampoo in markets here in Ohio!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo, tastes good, after wash hair, my hair is very smooth</li>
    <li> I always have a hair-losing problem when I move to a new place. When I moved to US, one of my friends recommended me to buy this production. And I did. I tried it three times after I bought it. Although you may feel your hair a little dry after using it, it really does work on the hair-losing problem. As a student, I thought it&#x27;s a little expensive for daily use, but after I saw its effect, I think it is worthy to buy if you have such a problem like me.</li>
    <li> Like the unique smell, and it leaves my hair dry and clean, love it</li>
    <li> after using this product with the Conditioner My hair feels and looks great , Now I will see if it helps my hair in the sense of not loosing it</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It seems to be causing less hair to fall out than normal shampoo, so that&#x27;s a plus, although I can&#x27;t say with confidence that I&#x27;ve seen any new growth with it, but I didn&#x27;t necessarily expect that either.  Love the smell, love the lather.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone concerned about thinning!</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with alopecia areata last April and had lost all my hair. I believe through a change in diet and using this shampoo, I started to see my hair growing back in October! Now it&#x27;s February, and my hair is about 3+&amp;#34; inches long! Amazing since I was afraid that my hair would never grow back. Now I know a lot of it has to do with my healthier life style and my decrease in stress, however, I do see a difference in my new hair using this shampoo -- its grown back a lot thicker than it was before. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Ok, although I read great reviews on this product I was totally skeptical! However, it works! It really does! Immediately after one use my hair has stopped falling out in the handfuls that it was. I am of mixed nationalities  (no one has ever guessed my nationality) my hair is curly but not coarse, this shampoo leaves my hair less frizzy, smooth and silk! Totally love this and will continue to buy. Also, my husband has a receding hair line and thinning, since using the shampoo this hair looks fuller and his scalp isn&#x27;t as noticeable! Yay, since he is barely 30!</li>
    <li> Love the way it leaves my hair</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo but not if you are a younger man who has not finished with facial or body hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a year for hair loss prevention and it&#x27;s made my hair both look and feel extremely healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But did some research on &amp;#34;DHT Blocking&amp;#34; shampoo.  They block DHT on the scalp but since the shampoo runs down your face and body it is also blocking DHT on your face and body which can slow down or stop development of body and facial hair.  Which is fine if you are a woman or an older man who is done with puberty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and prior to that my body and facial hair was coming in pretty fast and rampant but slowed down significantly since I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to give it up because of how great my hair looks and feels but not about to sacrifice facial and body hair over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel there should be some kinda warning on it that young men going through puberty shouldn&#x27;t use it because had i known that a year ago i would never have bought it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to determine its effectiveness on hair regrowth, but I&#x27;ll state my opinion thus far. This is the first time purchasing this product, and so far I like it. The shampoo is extremely thick; so thick, in fact, that it takes a bit of extra water to get it to suds up. No thin, watery mess is this. So consider the comment a compliment. The scent is different, but not off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few uses, I left it on my hair for three minutes to allow time for the infusion of the vitamins, etc., and it didn&#x27;t cause any stinging or negative reaction (as some I&#x27;ve used in the past). So, another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the thickness of the shampoo, and the resulting lather, it takes a bit to rinse out. Again, just stating, not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, overall, my hair feels really clean when done. I will try to remember to update this review later, after I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to determine its effectiveness on hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best shampoo I have tried ! It does not make your hair dry. Hair is volumized without that dry feeling. I bought it in october I still have about a little less than half Left. The best part I barely break any hair in the shower any more. You have to try it for few weeks to see results but by far the best I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair hard to comb through.  This meant I was pulling out hair.  This is not a good thing when you have thinning hair!</li>
    <li> It is a really nice product, I always have hair loss problem, and now it&#x27;d turning better and better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a year and still have not finished the first bottle. Now I do have short hair but find a little goes a long way. It lathers great and cleans really well. It has definitely added volume to my 50 yr old head. May be has prevented hair loss not exactly sure but will say I am not loosing hair rapidly. I am one who will not interfere with natural hair loss with chemicals and pills. If using for hair loss it is important to use this shampoo over an extended period of time. So I like the value, the volume it adds to my hair and may be it is slowing down my hair loss. PS I do use a post shower quality hair moisturizer it can be a bit drying.</li>
    <li> Has been using just over 3 weeks now....my hair is looks lot more manageable. I am also seeing a slight reduction of dry condition of my scalp. I will update as I use it more.</li>
    <li> It has a very herbal smell. Usually when i vacuum the house, I see a lot of hair all over the place. But not anymore. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a great product. It goes on very light. Leaves no residue and washes thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months. My hair is not falling out in clumps like it once was. It is fuller and thicker and feels really healthy. I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is a valid, and hope that it will soon hold.</li>
    <li> Hair feels great afterwards!</li>
    <li> Sure it&#x27;s expensive but it lathers up easily so you don&#x27;t need to use as much as you would think per wash.  I&#x27;ve used it for 6 months and the notion of using a shampoo with all natural ingredients seems great and smells good until you realize it hasn&#x27;t done anything after several weeks or months.  Already used regenepure and that did nothing.  Just bought the Nioxin 2 kit so hopefully that will thicken hair and stop hair loss even though it&#x27;s a Sulfate (sls) shampoo/conditioner.  (For the guys) I refuse to go back on propecia and rogaine due to the harsh side effects so hopefully this can at least stall the hairloss.</li>
    <li> Purchased due to thinning hair!  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helping but I LOVE IT!!!  Now my husband is using it too!</li>
    <li> could not be better shampoo</li>
    <li> only had it a short time</li>
    <li> Wow! Wow! Wow! What a great shampoo!!! I&#x27;m a 40 y/o male and started to loose my hair. I try many products, pills, massage and any recommendations out there. The only thing I did not try was prescribed medication since they all have bad side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a whole year since I purchased this product and one full bottle lasted me a whole year using it every other day. I have oily hair so this shampoo is been perfect for me; yess it dries up your hair; but in my case, that&#x27;s exactly what a shampoo needs to do. When I felt it was too dry, I just applied a small dot of conditioner, because normally I cant use any conditioner, since it leaves my hair too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a whole year using this shampoo my hair loss is back to normal, not execive, because the hair falls for new hair to grow. Before using Pura d&#x27;or I was loosing over a 100 hairs everyday (yes, I counted them), and after 3 months of using this product, the amount of hair loss was between 60-70, using it everyday. Then I started using it every other day and my hair loss reduced even more. After 6 months my hair loss was normal (between 25-50 hairs every other day) and my hair is now fuller, thicker with more volume; which means that all the hairs i loose are growing back normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yess, I&#x27;ve always use gel on my hair, still do. No, I dont dye my grays, &amp;#34;looks sexy&amp;#34; like it is my wife says. Remember: If you are a male loosing your hair it&#x27;s because DHT in your body that creates the oily sebum in your scalp bloking the pores, so this shampoo targets that oil in your scalp, the best way to make it work is by starting to use it during the early stage like I did; if you wait until you are completly bald I wont be able to tell you if it will work on you. I hope this review help many of you folks loosing your hair to stop it, like it did for me...Tnx, Eli</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else to say, except I like it better than anything I have tried in years. Janna</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for few months now. It appeared to have helped with hair loss issue in the beginning but it has dried my hair severely and changed its texture completely over this period of time. So, if you have dry hair, I think you need to think before using it.  From what doctors tell, shampoos hardly help with hair loss problems. Its nutrition that is most important.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for about a month. I haven&#x27;t noticed any new growth/length however my hair feels stronger and overall more plush. I find less hair in the comb even if I tear at it. I&#x27;ll revise my review if I notice any significant growth happening. Strength is nice but length is what I&#x27;m really looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a garbage shampoo..i have waste my money and time.....this is making me lose more hair than normal.this is a garbage shampoo...</li>
    <li> Cleans your hair but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in prevention then with normal shampoo.  Has an odd smell to it too.</li>
    <li> I just didn&#x27;t see much of a change. I didn&#x27;t like the texture and the smell was not anything fancy.  I used only that for awhile but I will not be buying another.</li>
    <li> this one is very good so far</li>
    <li> good product easy absorb</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels, and it&#x27;s all done organically!!  Good job!&lt;br /&gt;Sue Scarborough</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of Purador shampoo that I purchased.  My hair was noticeably thinning and I purchased the bottle after reading the glowing review. I love the Purador.  My hair feels stronger and softer.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I like the product but the pump came broken so I have to open the bottle every time I shampoo my hair.</li>
    <li> Considering that it&#x27;s organic and actually works is amazing. Very satisfied with such a quality product!</li>
    <li> Great product,really works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how this product is making my hair back to normal. The hair was getting thinner and falling out for five months. I followed the dermatologist recommendations but still the problem continued. I did my research and found Pura d&#x27;or Loss Prevention Shampoo. After a month and a half using it my hair is not falling out and it looks as healthy  as before.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and oiliy. I feel fresh and my hair is getting healthy after shampooing.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell, doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair that a cheap shampoo wouldn&#x27;t do. Very hard to squeeze the shampoo out, you have to push 20x to get anything out. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this 10 months ago for the first time.  Shampoo was amazing.  I reordered in March 2015 and the product was evidently different.  Color, consistency, smell.  They change the formula for something cheap, low quality leaving my hair awful.&lt;br /&gt;I guess is just classic lower quality to increase margins...</li>
    <li> This does seem to help the thickness and consistency of my hair.  I haven&#x27;t been using it too long, but I do notice some difference although it isn&#x27;t dramatic.  Smells nice.</li>
    <li> I have fine, color treated hair that I feared was thinning.  Although the website (and my dear friend who recommended it) said results typically are seen after 3 mos of use, I can already see a difference after about 4 weeks of use, using it 1-2x a week as part of my hair care &amp;#34;cocktail.&amp;#34;  I double-wash...the second time I leave it on for a few minutes as the directions state.  My hair already feels fuller, and even seems to be growing a little faster than usual.  I&#x27;m not wild about the smell...it&#x27;s slightly medicinal.  It&#x27;s not terrible or anything....in fact many reviewers seem to like it.  It&#x27;s a really nice shampoo and I&#x27;m eager to see the cumulative results in another couple months.  Note on some of the negatives posted by other reviewers:  *Lather - I experience low to moderate lather, and this is NOT a bad thing!  Sulfates are mainly what cause all the lather, but those can also be harmful to your hair and skin.  This shampoo states it is free from the main culprits of that.  *Price - When you compare the $20-$25 price point of Pura D&#x27;Or to higher end shampoos that are also paraben, sulfate, gluten, and pthalate free (like Alterna), it is actually cheaper considering you are getting double the amount (16 oz).  Comparable high-end shampoos are $20-$35, and they are only 8 oz.</li>
    <li> Great Product!! This actually works! I see my hair getting thicker AND some hair regrowth. Need to continue to use for extended results of course. It is very gentle as well. Does not dry out scalp.</li>
    <li> Great product the way its leaves my hair after i use it.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo for a month. It is a little dry after using it. But it is good for my oily scalp and I feel it is really working to prevent hair loss. My scalp feel better now. I will keep to use it to see how the magic it has.</li>
    <li> Thicker hair, great product!</li>
    <li> This is the first shampoo that really seems to at least slow the shedding, thicken and smooth my hair, and make it feel healthier.</li>
    <li> This seems to work, but it dried my waist length hair terribly. I recently cut my hair into a bob, and while it&#x27;s still drying, it&#x27;s manageable. I have dandruff and an itchy scalp for the first time in my life, so I&#x27;m guessing that this shampoo as well.&lt;br /&gt;But it really does seem to halt hair loss. I&#x27;d say I was losing dozens of hairs a day, and am only losing a handful now.</li>
    <li> Nobody wants to be bald headed and you cannot have a good first impression without having beautiful hair on your head. It is sad but true that most of the time losing hair is not in our hands. But if we want, then we could hold on to what we have got and get some of it back. My sad story about losing hair started a year ago. Then I found Pura d&#x27;or premium organic shampoo. I think that it is the best out there. It has the organic ingredients which helped me to stop my hair fall and grow it back. Now, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 3months now and no change at all. I will still give it more time, since I know they take some time. Hopefully can bring it up a star or two soon.</li>
    <li> l&#x27;m using these for 6 weeks and l don&#x27;t see any improvement.. My hair still falling. l will update my review after 6 more weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a while now and--although I&#x27;ve experienced one major round of shedding--I do feel that it&#x27;s stemmed the tide of hair loss.</li>
    <li> I wish I returned this shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t do anything to my hair but makes my hair dry. Maybe worth $2 ???</li>
    <li> This is fantastic if u have falling hair! First wash, nook hair loss. It smells just fine and it really works. U can use it with ur favorite shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really wish i can give a -5 star rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is horrible, all people buy this product are want to get our hair back,&lt;br /&gt;but after having this product for one week i throw it in the trash bin.&lt;br /&gt;Every time after i wash my hair i notice that more and more hair coming off.&lt;br /&gt;And the longer you use, you more you loss.!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even trust those fake comment!!!!!  This product is useless!!! and even harmful for you hair!!!</li>
    <li> this is the worst shampoo I ever used in my whole life!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of using this shampoo I noticed that I&#x27;m losing my hair faster than before!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo before and I really liked it. But this time, I saw that the same product completely changed. The color of the shampoo is different. Also, the smell of the new product is terrible. It smells like a bleach. And the results are worse than before. If you like to have terrible hair with the smell of bleach, this is the right shampoo for you.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair and scalp and this doesn&#x27;t make it worse and feels very soothing.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! My girlfriend bought this for me a while back and I noticed a big difference after a couple of months continued use. I am almost done with my bottle so I ordered a new one.  I noticed my hair is becoming thicker and fuller after 3 months. I am a life long customer from now on.</li>
    <li> only reason for star reduction is it can dry out your hair.</li>
    <li> Best hair loss Prevention oil I ever found..  I waste my thousands of money in buy expensive oil all around the world,  but no one suits on my hair.  But finally I got my product here named Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, Brown and Blue, 16 Fluid Ounce.&lt;br /&gt;  I personally so happy and satisfied by this products.&lt;br /&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s also expensive than other ordinary products here.  But I actually managed it by used this oil in a gap of one day. So it is usable upto  double of its duration.. But Overall  money value products.  Personally used it, and  therefore recommended  this Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, Brown and Blue, 16 Fluid Ounce for others..&lt;br /&gt;  Just Forget about  hair problems by using this..  :))</li>
    <li> Save your money....take biotin</li>
    <li> A nice shampoo, smells lovely, and it seems to be taking care of what hair I have left :)</li>
    <li> great product. would repurchase. the price is worth it though it is admittedly pricey.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s less hair collected in the strainer after I shower, but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s actually a physical difference in how my hair looks in terms of body, volume, and thickness. It lathers well when hair is more wet. I do like that this shampoo is color safe and cruelty free.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. I have been using it for a couple weeks now and really like how it has made my hair feel healthy, shinny and soft.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a month and I&#x27;m noticing a difference in the amount of hair lost during showers.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and less dry than with other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Good organic shampoo. The cause of hair loss is still a mystery. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t regrow your hair but will stop its progress. Maybe the solution is simple, the harsh chemicals in department store is what causes it? Maybe any organic shampoo will stop hair loss over time? Just some food for thought.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and leaves my hair feeling healthy. As far as the hair loss prevention part, I have not seen a noticeabl difference yet. Hopefully after my second bottle I will notice a difference in the hair loss.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair soft and smooth. Like the fact that its organic and without the harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> Shampoo of this kind are really very effective in making hair smooth and its quality even better...i used this shampooo and must say its really good and is worth to use</li>
    <li> I ordered this products...&lt;br /&gt;a recomendations from my friends...&lt;br /&gt;i was told..that the products really works. I&#x27;ve been ordering shampoo products for the&lt;br /&gt;past...none of them really works.&lt;br /&gt;to my surprised...Pura d&#x27;or  Hair works&lt;br /&gt;i dont even have to use a conditioner..&lt;br /&gt;it leaves my hair shiny and beautyfull.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for your great products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has little foam during wash. However, if you wash with a little shampoo for the first time and wash away, then you will feel normal for the second time.</li>
    <li> I received the Shampoo Dec 27th 2014 but I did not begin using them until January 7th 2015, In one week my hair is feeling better already and I don’t lose as much as hair as before, I strongly believe that this shampoo will take care the problem I have loosing hair. I will write more after I use it for 30 days about the 30 days results</li>
    <li> My husband just loves this shampoo he said he does not want to use any other one from now on just pura d or</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month and I love it. It smells fantastic. It is a very unique smell, but I enjoy it every time that I open it. I have already noticed my hair getting fuller and stronger. It is a more expensive product, but thus far it has been worth it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I still have experienced hair loss but they are less than before.</li>
    <li> It works the best if you have short hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my long hair, and it was very difficult to brash my hair after, if I didn&#x27;t apply any good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my mom, who has short hair, and it stopped her hair loss right away, and her hair looks better to me.</li>
    <li> I hair is still falling, but I can see some new hair growing as well.</li>
    <li> I like this product due to the fact it isn&#x27;t full of chemicals. it smells good. my girlfriend even likes it. I am not sold on the fact of it helping prevent hair loss. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference really...and I have almost used a full bottle.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shampoo. It makes my hair look really good, and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is great!</li>
    <li> I have used other hair loss and thickening products for about 6 months now.  Every time I get in the shower I run my hands though my hair and check them out to see how much hair is on them.  I would usually get a good 10-15 pieces of hair.  I have decided to start to use more natural and organic products for many aspects of my life so I purchased this.  I was so excited to get it and try it!  First I LOVE the smell of it and the feel of it when I let it sit in my hair.  Second, after 1 day of washing my hair with 1 pump of this shampoo the next day when running my hands though my hair I counted only 3 pieces of hair on them.  After the second day of using this shampoo I counted only 1 piece of hair on my hands.  I am going to be on my 3rd day tonight although I did cheat and use it earlier before work and counted NO hair on my hands!!!  Tonight will be a full 60 hours of having this product with a reduction in hair lose to 0 hairs per wash!!!  AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> Have bought and tried many different shampoos for prevention of hair loss without any success at all.  After using Pura d&#x27;or Organic Shampoo, there are NOT any hair in the tub floor when I get out!  After three hair transplants I&#x27;ve about given up, but I will tell you Pura d&#x27;or is the miracle shampoo... Thank You Jesus!</li>
    <li> Lathers up with a tingly menthol feeling. Gets hair clean. Bottle lasts a while.</li>
    <li> Just received this product, used it and the smell is decent. Obviously haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet since it is my first use but I have a friend who uses it and highly recommends this product. It feels a little interesting on the scalp but I am hopeful it will lower the amount of hair that falls out. I will update this in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product so far, with a month  of use. I have very fine and thin hair. Shampooing with gold label actually makes my hair look much fuller and thicker. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this shampoo</li>
    <li> Wanted to return.  Made my hair very bushy and feel I&#x27;m allergic because I was allergic to the Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick easy delivery</li>
    <li> The only shampoo that has worked for me so far!</li>
    <li> I am pissed off，can&#x27;t turn to open！！！！！！！！</li>
    <li> The shampoo is good. My hair gained thickness and strength. Hairfall has reduced.</li>
    <li> It just isn&#x27;t for me, I don&#x27;t have as much hair loss but it dries out my hair. I only use it every few days</li>
    <li> In the one month of use so far I notice that my hair is now thicker, but I have not seen a slow down in the number of hairs loss with each shampooing.</li>
    <li> never ever try this s*** on your hair  it&#x27;s not working, i thought it would stop but nothing changed, nothing !</li>
    <li> bought this product after doing some research on shampoos and conditioners that are healthier for daily use and/or help prevent hair loss.  the ingredients are all safe and healthy for your scalp and skin. when putting it on it bubbles up and lathers well.  although this isn&#x27;t cheap shampoo its fairly cheaper than some other hairloss prevention shampoos.  minus 1 star because the price, there isn&#x27;t anything in these shampoos that justify the price, and also the scent.. it isn&#x27;t bad but it took some getting used to.  coming from using normal cheap shampoos with all the super good scents...  this stuff has more of a medicinal smell. but like the title says, this is my second time buying and ill buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. Not sure if my hair is growing, but, my scalp feels better for sure and my hair feels thicker</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any result and the dispenser piece doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any actual results yet. The directions don&#x27;t say to use the product daily, so I use it about 3-4 times per week, but I don&#x27;t see any difference in this product or my previous product.</li>
    <li> this does not work. been using it for a few weeks and it only dries out my hair.  also smells horribly - smells like medicine. i also bought the conditioner.  the conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell as bad but doesn&#x27;t really help moisturizing the dryness the shampoo causes. i recommend the ultra labs hair lush - better hydrating, smells good, and does prevent hair loss - didn&#x27;t notice hair growth but did notice less hair loss.  hair lush costs a bundle though which is why i tried looking for something cheaper.</li>
    <li> Have been using this since last Fall. It felt a little dry during the winter, but it&#x27;s perfect right now in late Spring/ early Summer. The order is fine, and easy to generate a lot of foam. Didn&#x27;t really notice changes on preventing hair loss so far. But it&#x27;s good to know the product I use on my scalp and hair has less chemical burden on it.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell of the conditioner and how it made my hair feel , great product!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo - my hair is noticeably fuller</li>
    <li> Pros:  Gentle on hair and scalp, great lather for an organic shampoo, leaves hair feeling clean and healthy, and requires less product than other organic brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The pump top on the bottle leaks water inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Pura D’or product for just over 2 years.  Can I say it miraculously stopped my hair loss?  I really can’t say; it’s not like I did a test using another shampoo on one half of my head.  What I can say is I used various name brand organic shampoos before using Pura D’or and none of them worked as well.  My hair felt softer and less dry immediately and within weeks of using Pura D’or I saw a visible difference in the appearance of my significantly thinning hair.  I don’t think new hair appeared, but it seemed my hair was probably thicker and healthier.  I also noticed less hair around the sink and counter after brushing and styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest and only real complaint is the design of the pump top.  I noticed my first bottle seemed to be lasting an amazingly long time.  Eventually, I realized it was because water kept leaking around the pump shaft and into the bottle and it was mostly water by then.  You have to keep it away from falling water or find a new top.  In order to keep my bottle in the shower I took the better-designed top from my wife’s empty shampoo bottle and cut the straw short enough to fit the Pura D’or bottle.  It doesn’t screw on tight but at least it keeps the water out.  Hopefully Pura D’or has fixed this design flaw by now.</li>
    <li> It does what it claims.  Too bad it doesn&#x27;t grow hair the same way it prevents loss.</li>
    <li> Surprised here as I&#x27;ve tried others but never liked. This, however, seems - so far as of maybe a month now - to actually do something to thicken my hair &amp; less falling. Again; surprised. But happily so! Plus leaves scalp &amp; hair feeling healthy.</li>
    <li> Got this product for my father.  Must say it is great and comes in a nice bottle.</li>
    <li> Overall I have been pleased with this shampoo thus far.  I have been using it about a month so far, and I think my shedding has slowed down if not stopped.  The shampoo smell is indifferent.  It&#x27;s not great but certainly not terrible.  I do really like the way my hair feels after using the product.  I plan to keep using this for a few more months before making any final opinions.  I will try to come back and give an update once I&#x27;m completely finished with the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today I would recommend giving this a try.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that my hair has grown back, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s what this shampoo is claiming anyway.  It seems to be more of a preventative measure.  All in all I give this a 4/5 with the possibility of being upgraded to a 5/5 in the future if things keep going well.</li>
    <li> Use this every other day.  Hair is healthy looking and feels great.  Noticeable difference as far as hair loss goes.  Don&#x27;t see as many loose hairs when I blow dry it now.  I would recommend it.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I am using this shampoo for a little over 4 months now.. I like how my hair feel after a head wash.. The shampoo in itself is nice and has reduced hair fall but the results are short of my expectations.. My hair still falls more than the usual amount.. I would continue using the shampoo for a few more months and see if the fall stops.. And accordingly update my review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Leaves hair soft&lt;br /&gt;2. Small amount is enough for a thorough wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Hasn&#x27;t stop hairfall (although reduced but the results are far short of expectations)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all its worth a try! And the bottle lasts long so in the long run its not as expensive as it looks when you buy it.. Although, &amp;#60; $30 price tag would be more appropriate..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three months and there has been no improvment yet.  My hairdresser said a product should contain morrocan oil, not the cheaper argan oil in this product, to see results.  I&#x27;m going to try that next!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too sure about this product, I still had the same amount of hair fall when using this. I&#x27;d save yourself the money and find a cheaper organic set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 bottles of this stuff, hoping something would help as I am only 28 and nearly bald on the top.  At first, there did seem to be a difference and my wife noticed as well.  However, with each new bottle, it seemed like the formula was changing.  Each bottle would smell different than the last one and would react different with my scalp.  With the current bottle I am on, the tingling sensation that you normally would start to feel after leaving it on your scalp for a couple minutes, does not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes me wonder how their quality control is handled and the consistency of the product.  I do admire the fact that it is completely organic, but it does not seem to be making a difference for my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any positive results yet, but no negative ones either. Can&#x27;t hurt to keep using as hair takes 3 to 6 months or more to grow.</li>
    <li> I had increased generalized hair loss of an unknown cause, and while I can&#x27;t say this is what necessarily stopped it, I noticed quick results after I started using this after other products weren&#x27;t working.. Now I keep ordering it.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Smells nice and leaves your hair feeling fuller.  Not sure how much of this product makes your hair grow back but only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to know if it helps regrow hair.  But it does appear to have slowed down or stopped my thinning. And it is the best shampoo my wife and I have ever used.  A very small, dime-sized amount produces a thick lather, so the price is not as high as more watery shampoos. I like the smell and the hair feels fine without using conditioner.  I&#x27;m comparing this to Nioxin and so far I prefer Pura d&#x27;Or.  The menthol in the Nioxin Conditioner gives a nice, tingly sensation.  But my sense is that Pura d&#x27;Or is healthier, and I like the time savings of just one shampoo -- no conditioner needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post again in a few months to report on long-term hair effects.  For right now, this is our favorite by a wide margin.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine with sensitive scalp. After using this shampoo, I feel itchy, and my hair is getting stiff.</li>
    <li> My bottle was defective and had to be opened with pliers by my husband. The shampoo works well for thinning African American hair, but does slightly dry it out and has an earthy smell. However once you use the conditioner, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I had a typical case of hair loss. I use to lose so much hair that even after combing my hair,it won&#x27;t stop. I will still find hair on my clothes,on pillows and on floor at home and at work! I feel like I was shredding like dog,wherever I go I will leave my trial of hair behind. It was really awful. I had tried many other expensive brand shampoos but did not seem to work. When I read reviews of this shampoo on Amazon,I was not optimistic that this shampoo would work but I wanted to try to see if it would make any difference. I noticed little difference in quantity of hair fall after 3 uses.I would say like 25% less. My hair was smooth and soft.After using for few times I noticed my pillow was not full of hair and did not find hair on my blouse like I use to find all the time. It&#x27;s been 3 months now and still results are improving! I would say now I see 50% difference in my hair fall. It does take time, you need to be patient.I will continue using this shampoo to achieve more better results where I wanted.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell, but I think it&#x27;s helping with the hair loss.  It does make my hair feel dry like hay which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this product from Amazon, but from Pura d&#x27;or website to ensure I didn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;fake product&amp;#34; some reviews suggest. I am going to be 38 and I&#x27;m experiencing hair loss and thinning. this shampoo made my hair fall out more!! I used it for over a week straight, and my hair was coming out in gobs while washing and combing.  I even noticed more shedding during day and constantly picking hairs off me, something not usual before using this product.  I even Bought the Gold label in hopes it would give better results. Nope. If anything my hair is worse. Left hair dry and straw like and a big increase in hair loss. I&#x27;ve contacted pur a&#x27; dor directly so I can ship back the two bottles I purchased.</li>
    <li> does a good job cleaning hair; been using for about 2 weeks so difficult to say for sure about hair growth/loss prevention, smell is somewhat mediciny--like neutrogena t-fal shampoos.  but otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best! I love how this doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals unlike other hair products that has sulfate. It has a nice smell and lots of suds in lathering. The more I use it, less hair has fallen out. However a con about this is it makes my hair a little dry, but I use another brand leave in conditioner to solve this problem.</li>
    <li> I am honestly so pleased with the results! I am in my 40&#x27;s and have been losing my hair and seeing it thin out for quite some time and thought there wasn&#x27;t anything I could really do about it. I was even wearing clip in hair extensions to help. I have been using this product, combined with the conditioner for about a month and I can absolutely see a difference in my hair quality. It is thicker, now mind you, I have thin hair so it isn&#x27;t lush or anything, but it is thicker for me. It has also grown faster and I just went to my hair dresser and before I could say anything, she commented on how healthy my hair was and how soft it was and asked me what I had been doing different! True story!! I am so glad I tried this. I will say that if you use it like a traditional shampoo and expect it to lather up into this glorious bunch of suds, that doesn&#x27;t happen. You should just work it into your scalp and hair and not try to bunch it all up into a lather. Your hair will feel stiff, but as soon as you use the conditioner, it feels amazing afterwards. Hope this helps...I know how embarrassing it feels to have thinning hair and this really did work for me.</li>
    <li> Use less product, I suggestion don&#x27;t buy. All fake news saying that these product is good for hair growth. But I can suggest if you want to loose hair then buy these product.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this item.  If you take a minute to look at the 4 and 5 star reviews - you can point out the fake ones very easily.  They likely all have just one name, and their English/grammar is terrible.  I didn&#x27;t even try this product, because after I ordered it, I went to the 1 and 2 star reviews and found out the truth - that people tended that have more hair loss after using the shampoo.  Don&#x27;t ever trust a company that pays people to write false reviews!  They should be banned from Amazon!</li>
    <li> This may smell a little weird, but it does wonders to my scalp and hair.  It may just be the placebo effect, but I can feel my hair being healthier and stronger, also thicker too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for almost 8 months now and it does seem to make a difference. My hair feels thicker and I like the smell of the shampoo. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for approximately 1 month.  I definitely notice less hair falling out which is great.  The cons: Minimal lather which I like to have that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling.  Drying to my hair.  Medicinal fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the shampoo as I do feel it is helping.</li>
    <li> more hair loss. buy two at once which turns out to be a silly action...why the product getd high rank?</li>
    <li> I think the pura d&#x27;or company pays people to write good reviews for this product.  I was very unhappy with the shampoo.  It was watery and didn&#x27;t smell pleasant. It made my hair dry and my head itchy. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a longtime Nioxin user, but it looks like the product line is jacked up with the product now being produced in Mexico. So I tried this. There is no SLS but it foams up so good, don&#x27;t know how they do that - so you only need to use a very little bit... usually just one pumps worth. I&#x27;m interested to see in a few months how it deals with my hair retention.</li>
    <li> Can indeed effectively reduce hair loss, but at the same time there will be more dandruff and oil. But the taste is not very good.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is not as good as advertised, although it does leave your hair better looking after you wash, don&#x27;t know how long till i see any difference</li>
    <li> Great shampoo but top was broken.</li>
    <li> I’m a male in the low 40’s and had noticeably thinning fine hair. I’ve been using this shampoo for over a year now and getting great results. I used to use Nioxin and have even tried the Revivogen system. Nioxin is ok and Revivogen is way too expensive, but this stuff has made the biggest difference and leaves my hair looking much thicker. I haven’t been losing nearly as much hair (some hair loss is natural) and my hair has been growing faster than ever. I ran out a while back and tried using Nioxin again since I can’t find this stuff in stores. I ended up having Amazon rush me a couple bottles of Pura d’or and threw the Nioxin shampoo in the trash. The fact that it is organic is an added bonus and could explain why it works so well. It’s not going to be nearly as harsh or contain stuff that clogs up the pours on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially skeptical because of the number of reviews on this product. I thought it might be some type of a marketing strategy that used a bunch of fake reviews which I’ve seen before. I was desperate for thicker looking hair so I purchased it anyway. Look at the reviews for verified purchases and you’ll see that that is not the case. Also, one of the bottles I received a while back had a sticker on it that offered a fee bottle of shampoo if I gave an “Honest Review” of the product which also explains the numbers. It did not say good review, just an honest one. This is the only shampoo I will use now, just wish I would have found this when I was younger.</li>
    <li> I have to say at first I was very skeptical, I&#x27;ve seen commercials with claims of hair loss prevention products and I always thought nothing like that would ever work. I was wrong about this product. With continued use I noticed thicker fuller hair. I will most definitely be reordering this product! After a few haircuts my usual haircut lady person said it appeared as though I had hair re growing in areas. Mind you in not bald, I don&#x27;t have a crazy comb over like that aging cashier at Walmart, but I do have noticeably thinning hairline. My fiancé has also noticed results. Now if only I could get rid of my baby face and actually grow some facial hair! Thank you Pura!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a blogger and got to try this for free and all opinions are my own and not biased! but I have to say I&#x27;m super impressed! I have very fine, thinning hair and when I would wash my hair clumps would literally fall out. I beleive most of what was falling out was just damaged, broken hair. But I went from losing handfuls to losing a few strands! It does make my hair greasy after two days but that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ll take the good with the bad. Also, it smells very &#x27;herb-y&#x27; but if you combine it with the lavender vanilla conditioner, the conditioner totally masks the herb smell. It is all organic and says is ok for color treated hair. The shampoo did concern me, because it makes my hair feel super dry after using (while still in shower and wet) but after conditioner is used, it&#x27;s fine! I&#x27;m very glad I found this so my hair can stop breaking and I stopped losing so much!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It&#x27;s gentle, has a pleasant smell, and it does seem to reduce shedding compared to other shampoos. Hair and scalp are left feeling healthy and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this organic shampoo and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with the results. My hair looks thicker. It&#x27;s not a magic cure but it seems to work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a shampoo without the harsh chemicals found in common/cheaper shampoos, and I do like the way it cleans my hair.  It also suds up nicely, even without the SLS, if that&#x27;s a concern for you.  However, there are two items to consider.  First, you&#x27;ll likely need a conditioner because this shampoos definitely sucked the moisture out of my hair.  Second, if you&#x27;re hoping for a miracle hair-loss cure, you probably need to look at a prescribed medication or something else designed specifically for hair loss prevention.  Maybe the vitamins and minerals work to reduce the hair loss rate, but if you&#x27;re losing hair like I am, you&#x27;re probably not going to stop the loss completely.  I deducted a star due to the drying issue and the fact that the hair-loss prevention claim is questionable.  All in all, I&#x27;ll continue buying this shampoo (after my complimentary bottle for the review) due to my personal desire to have fewer harsh chemicals in my personal care products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 2012 and it has reduced my hair loss 8-12 weeks since i started using it (initially i used 2-3 times a week). Now, I use it 1-2 times a week and it lasts for about 4-6 months. It is a good value for what you pay. Took some time to get used a shampoo which does not smell like the usual ones (fragrance, if you will) . I feel this has a more herbal smell to it and is light and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I go to the clinic for any possible solution of my hair fall. But they just get their payment and said that once you lost your hair you can&#x27;t get them back by using a hair loss prevention shampoo. But I didn&#x27;t believe their prescription or advice. I was keep watching for the right solution for my hair, which were almost gone. At last I found a hair loss prevention shampoo. It helped me. I am satisfied with this product because it gives me not so much, but some new hair. This fully changed my outlook. Thanks to Pura d&#x27;or and I want to recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 8 months, and it is good, but preventing hair loss is not significant.  I don&#x27;t know if I have not used it long enough or not. I&#x27;m keeping using it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work out at least stop me from my itching, also my hair stays less oily for longer. recommend it to people with thin/oily hair.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t done a thing to stop daily hair loss. In fact, it seems to have increased the number of hairs in the sink after drying the hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser laughed when I told her I was using this special oil. &amp;#34;Good luck, I don&#x27;t think it will do anything.&amp;#34; It appears she was&lt;br /&gt;correct. (Others may disagree if they have had a reduction of hair loss).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shampoo, it is OK. Good foaming and smells pleasant. But at this price, there are other products that provide similar hair cleansing without the oil ... or the claim to stop hair loss.</li>
    <li> I tried. I did. I tried to give it 2 whole months to see if the product worked. But it didn&#x27;t. In fact, it left my hair even worse. Just like many of the other genuine reviewers out there with low scores, they experienced the same thing I did. At first, the few shampoos were okay, but my hair started shedding more then usual. As with most of these hair products, hair loss gets worse before it improves. However, after 2 months, it continually got worse. Hair shed more rapidly with each passing usage and along with that, irritation and dryness and flakes started to develop to the point it was unbearable. Going back to H&amp;S and will not look back. You can check for yourself, about 90% of the positive reviews for this product are fake as the reviewer peculiarly only has one review: a positive review for this product. Coincidence? I think not!</li>
    <li> I am African American with coily hair. I thought because this shampoo was sulfate free and had Argan oil in it that it would make my hair soft. It didn&#x27;t! Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really notice much. But keeping hope alive</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see an improvement. Cleaned hair well though</li>
    <li> I was sceptical about this product, but I had to try something to stop the mass migration of hair from my head to the shower drain.  About 11 months ago I noticed that whenever I took a shower my hair was stopping the water from drain yen I was losing so much.  After a few months of this I noticed that I was really noticing thinner hair in the front.  I was starting to get really worried because my mother has a big spot in the front of her head that is almost bald and I did not want to end up that way.  I chose this product for three reasons.  1) The price was reasonable compared to other alternatives therefore if it didn&#x27;t work I wasn&#x27;t out that much money. 2) I wanted a shampoo vs an oral option with tons of possibly scary side effects and 3). I like the that this was an organic product that is safe for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product now for five months.  I put it on and lather it up.  I usually take about 20 minutes in the showing washing, shaving my legs, etc.  I leave the product lathered up on my hair the whole time and rinse it out last.  After the first couple of washes I noticed that when I rinsed out my hair, there was no hair in the drain.  This has held true for the last 5 months, if I do notice any hair it&#x27;s only 1 or 2 strands not the fist full I was losing prior each wash.  My beautician has stated to me on a couple of occasions as well that I have a lot of new growth.  I color my hair once a morn and this shampoo does not leach the color out.  In fact I feel that my color stays longer with this shampoo that with a very expensive color safe Lanza shampoo I was previously using.  I do agree with other reviews that the smell is a very medicine like smell, but this can be easily remedied with a styling product or leave in conditioner.  I personally have not noticed that this causes dandruff, in fact my scalp tends to be dry due to frequent color on my hair and since using this product, I feel that my scalp is actually lessdry.  Overall I like this product.  I have long hair and my first bottle has lasted several months.  I have decided to reorder.  The only reason I am giving this 4 instead of five stars is 1) the smell of the shampoo and 2) I feel as though I need to use this longer to make sure that it does not lose its effectiveness after long term.  If I am still getting the same results a year from now, then I will change my rating to a five star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different Argan Oil shampoos in the past. However, after going through a number of them, I found this one to be my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is the only one that I tried that truly felt &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; to me. The smell and texture of the shampoo compared to some I&#x27;ve used in the past in the jungles of Peru (I&#x27;m not making fun here. It just reminded me of the completely natural shampoos they make for people who visit the lodges over there) and more importantly, it always left my hair looking and feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll be making this shampoo my permanent solution, at least until the gold version comes out, which I intend on trying out as well.</li>
    <li> Not sure of any regrowth, but it&#x27;s a nice shampoo - hair is soft and shiny and not greasy.  Like it!</li>
    <li> I LOVED IT, AS I HAVE USED ONLY ONE BOTTLE AND I HAVE ORDER THE SECOND ONE AS IT HAS IMPROVED A LOT MY  HAIR AS NO MORE LOSING HAIR NOW AND I RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE TO USED IT.</li>
    <li> awesome product. initial 2 uses i see some new hair growth.both me and my wife see same results. so it surely works</li>
    <li> This is actually cause my hair to fall out.  Noticed many more hairs in the sink.  I am going to try and return the remaining product.  Amazon is usually pretty good with this.  Don&#x27;t bother using this.</li>
    <li> My hair has dramatically changed since using this product. I had recently taken out my hair extensions only to find that my hair was rapidly falling out. Terrified, I researched into hair loss shampoos and this product came highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about two weeks, my hair stopped falling out as rapidly and has returned back to its usual thickness. Will be using this product for life! A great, great hair loss shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love it! after just a month of using this I could feel a difference. My hair feels softer, fuller, and just plain healthier. Pura d&#x27;or will have to go out of business for me to switch to a different shampoo!</li>
    <li> Besides leaving my hair more manageable and shiny, my hair loss in the sink and on the back of my shirts after combing have decreased substantially. I model part-time and find that my hair seems fuller on my latest shoots. Thus, I am very satisfied with the shampoo and just reordered my second bottle!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Creates a really clean feeling on the scalp when finished. Hopefully the DHT blockers will be as efficient as minoxidil. So far everything is staying in place on top of my head</li>
    <li> I first tried this product through groupon and it seemed to make my hair look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;After the bottle became empty, I noticed my hair was thinning considerably. This makes me think that Purad&#x27;or had caused hair growth and when the product ran out, I was no longer keeping my hair. I must mention, my maternal grandmother was bald by 30yrs of age, so hair loss does run in my family. I just bought a 2nd bottle and have used it once. I will keep you posted....</li>
    <li> I switched to this after trying a different shampoo and felt this product did nothing to help build volume or address any hair loss. In fact I think my hair feels and looks thinner and less fuller. Couldnt recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff was a big waste of money.  I have a slight bit of thinning so I bought this shampoo because it claims to help hair loss.  Been using it for 2 months now every single day and have not seen one bit of difference in my hair.  I think most of the glowing reviews are fake.  This stuff is snake oil as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that there is no hair shampoo to help stop hair thinning and your best bet is to just focus on volumizing shampoos that you can buy at a fraction of the cost of this garbage.</li>
    <li> Worst product ever! Instead of preventing hair loss, it induces hair loss. If you use this product it will make you loose your hair. I had normal short hair, without any signs of thinning but I wanted an Organic shampoo. I tried this product for six months as it was recommended for daily use. Looking at my photos, my hair has actually begun thinning after using this product. What is noticeable is the area where i applied the most shampoo, the crown of my head, is drastically thinning. I have stopped using the shampoo for one month now but my hair has yet to return to normal. The individuals who recommended this product have clearly written fictitious reviews. I am upset at amazon for selling such a product. Absolute waste of time and money! Even if your hair is not thinning, do not use this product. Can anyone tell me if my hair will return to normal and if so how long after i stop using this shampoo should i expect my hair to return to its normal state?</li>
    <li> my hair loss more than before</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it works for me. Now I find less hair on my pillow after I wake up.</li>
    <li> My first impression of the product was about the smell: it stinks. Too bad!! I dont want to go out smelling like a remedy. Mmm i&#x27;ll have to give it a try and i&#x27;ll update my review. I hope it isn&#x27;t that awful afeter all.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, haven&#x27;t seen the effects yet though</li>
    <li> Shampoo is good to fight to prevent from loosing more hair.  It leaves my hair alittle dry though so I use a conditioner afterwards.</li>
    <li> The main reason I wanted to try this product was its organic. In addition to that, the shampoo prevents from hair loss. I have long hair which also looked dried out due to highlights and color. I needed something that will help reduce hair loss and leave moisture in my hair. After a week of using this product, my mom asked me &amp;#34;what did you do to your hair? It looks good, not frizz.&amp;#34; Since then, I gave the shampoo and the conditioner as gifts to friends and family. It&#x27;s safe and pure that my young children use as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you have long full hair it may seem like you need a lot of shampoo to lather. This shampoo does not foam like your other shampoos. I usually use two pumps directly into the front roots of my hair then use one pump for the back. Leave the shampoo in for  about five minutes. Rinse and use the conditioner. I have used so many shampoos and they all dried out my hair. I am happy I found my shampoo.</li>
    <li> The best condition I have ever used - does not make my fine hair greasy and it feels noticeably thicker! I am so happy I&#x27;ve find a natural product that is helping me. Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for half a year and did not see any effect.</li>
    <li> Tried product for four shampooings. Left hair dry but voluminous. For the limited time of use I lost four times as many hairs on the shower than I typically lose using Regenepure DR / NT. The claims of the superior product were completely false for me. Buyer beware. Not even worth the one star rating.</li>
    <li> Tried it just once and noticed a huge difference.  Less hair in the shower!!  I will be using this product always.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this shampoo will prevent hair loss on its own, but in combination with Rogaine it seems to reduce hair loss and make your hair seem a little thicker and fuller. I gave it 4/5 starts because I think it could have some interesting fragrance or ingredient to make the scalp feel more clean. The shampoo smell is pretty plain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and my hair has fallen out less; probably by half.  Been suffering from postpartum hair loss and this has been working so far.  I hope to get thick hair again, but time will tell.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo and also rogaine, and I have gotten great results. I will continue using both.</li>
    <li> Great! will buy again.</li>
    <li> I order 2 bottle my hair is stronger  and I have friends saying I have more hair</li>
    <li> I just used for the first time and I feel good. I notice my hair loss is less. My hair looks clean and less oily all day. Shampoo smell is natural and pleasant.I am glad to try this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 3-4 months. I noticed I am shedding less hair and the hair appears to be thicker. I&#x27;ve noticed I see less scalp on the crown of my head, but I would still like to see more hair growth to cover that area. It did make my hair feel a little bit dry but I could tell my scalp was really clean. Overall I have noticed a difference and would recommend this product, I&#x27;m sure with continued use I will see more results.</li>
    <li> Really well done. We love this Shampoo. Makes your hair feel great as well! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I have less hair loss, and my hair gradually become thicker.</li>
    <li> After coloring my hair I had terrible hair loss. Falling hair were covering carpets and floors. I found this shampoo on Amazon and ordered a bottle. After first wash my hair stopped falling. But I feel I need to use conditioner after shampoo, so I just received one of the same brand. Will try tomorrow and see how it goes for my hair</li>
    <li> I normally do not give out reviews for items, but this is a product I must review due to my horrible experiences with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this item, I started to get dandruff on the very first wash. I normally do not experience dandruff, but this item has really brought the worse of it. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and thought the dandruff may have been a seasonal thing that has finally effected me. Thing is, when I switched back to my previous shampoo after two weeks of using the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention, the dandruff was gone. When I switched to the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo after coming back to my old one, the dandruff came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it did somewhat thicken my hair for the time being, I can&#x27;t tell you if it works or not because the manufacturer recommends a few months of use so you can see the difference and I only used this item for almost 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I do not recommend it unless it works for you. I have read other reviews by other people and it seems that it worked for others and a few people experienced the same issue I got. I recommend the company to send out samples for those who want to test the waters. As mentioned before, it only took one washing to trigger my dandruff. I will give it two stars instead of one due to the brief thickening my hair had when I used this product.</li>
    <li> Seems like this shampoo stripped my hair, leaving it feeling dry , tangled and brittle. Also removes permanent hair color. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Quality product. Have tried many products. Does not regrow lost hair but is great at thickening remaining hair. Causes dandruff but I would recommend it to ppl who have thinning hair and want to stop the loss and thicken hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! Exceeded my expectations - my hair was VERY damaged. Just what I needed!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. I ordered it along with pura dor&#x27;s argan oil. I have a very long hair and I haven&#x27;t gotten a hair cut for a long time. So I have very dry and split ends. I wanted to try No-Poo method. But I didn&#x27;t wanna endure greasy hair for 3 months. This is a great option for people who are considering dumping generic shampoo for their scalp and hair. After using this shampoo, my hair feels so much smoother and moisturized. My hair used to get really dry after shampoo before I started using this one. But this one doesn&#x27;t dry up your hair. I am so glad I tried this. My scalp is so much healthier too.</li>
    <li> This shampoo seemed to help my hair from falling out in clumps. I&#x27;ve been very stressed and noticed my hair falling out rapidly and once I stared using this shampoo several times, the excessive loss seemed to slow down. The smell is nice, earthy, and I love using organic ingredients on myself. The seller was great, rapid shipment.</li>
    <li> I just starting using this because I have oily greasy hair and it has definitely reduced the oil and made my scalp less itchy.  My hair was slightly thinning, however the shampoo seems to make it more fuller.  I am not sure about regrowth of hair since I have not been using this long. I also use this on my beard and seems to make my beard much softer.</li>
    <li> From my friend -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I bought this product for my friend&#x27;s wife and it works wonderfully. Great product ! She tried other products also but this shampoo works great.This Shampoo is naturally organic and safe.It nourishes each and every hair’s root and strengthens the weakened hair.It improves the texture of the hair and works effectively in reducing and preventing hair fall due to breakage.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a product that actually works folks! The smell is a bit menthol like, but im guessing its the natural ingredients within it. It has a tingling sensation when you use it which I love because it makes my hair and scalp feel really clean. I have a HUGE shedding problem and my husband has a receding hair line he does not care for and this shampoo has been a life saver! You cant beat something that is organic, cruelty free, Dr. Trusted, and works! Amazing job Pura d&#x27;or!!</li>
    <li> I liked the product but I was told that there was another product just like this one that was completely natural no artificial colours and I was wondering what that one cost and that part number for that one was?</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo a couple weeks ago after reading about it in a couple of magazines and websites. I have thin, oily hair and my hair is constantly shedding - in and out of the shower. So when i read about this product i figured it was a must try. First, the shampoo has a slight mediciney fragrance but nothing too terrible. Secondly, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather like a traditional shampoo. Not to say that it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as traditional shampoos, just that i dont get a big head of lather. So far i don&#x27;t see as much hair in my brush, but of course i can&#x27;t say anything to new or additional hair growth. Too soon to to see any significant changes, but definitely satisfied and willing to commit to it for a few months to see the full results.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Lasts forever and does seem to reduce hair loss. If I am going to out something in my hair everyday, I want something that nourishes my scalp.</li>
    <li> smells good, not too sure of anything else. But it does smell good. Little expensive. Now I need more words to take up space.</li>
    <li> I have started using a week now, and I love it. Love the way it makes my hair feel. It is soft and shinny,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed. The bottle doesn&#x27;t look fancy but you need only a drop to soap your hair. I like it very much. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this results but it&#x27;s really good.</li>
    <li> It works good for an organic conditioner, but didn&#x27;t notice any change in hair loss.</li>
    <li> Man uses shampoo cuz it says so, nothing weird about this one and that&#x27;s all I needed.</li>
    <li> Surprised with all positive reviews. Leaves hair very dry and brittle. Waste of money. I have been using it for over 2 months and my hair condition including hair fall has gone worse.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly now after rogaine and other chemicals failed to work.  This leaves my hair looking thicker and reduces the thinning and falling out.  It also smells great and lasts a long time.  I like the pump bottle and only have to use one pump for a full lather.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 6 months and have seen some small new hair growth.  I hope it continues to work!</li>
    <li> This is a very good shampoo and it has definitely made a difference with me on the hair loss issue.  My hair tends to be oily and this shampoo keeps that under control and the amount of hair in the bottom of the drain has been reduced by 90%.  I highly recommend this shampoo and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t provide the best lather and doesn&#x27;t have the best smell, but seems to strengthen my hair and provides a nice clean shine. Just started using this product so only time will tell if it helps improve the quality of my hair. I have always had thin hair and hopefully this product can help provide me with a thicker head of hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a healthier alternative for my current shampoos but this only made my hair more brittle, dry, tangled - absolutely impossible to comb through. I actually think this contributed to more hair loss than save my hair. I am a big believer in purchasing a product based on popularity in Amazon but this was a huge disappointment. Switched over to a salon brand shampoo/conditioner (Pureology) and noticed a major difference in the health of my hair within no time. Would not recommend this if you have fine hair or if you don&#x27;t have to much hair to lose. Now if you are one of the few lucky ones with lots of mane to lose, use away!</li>
    <li> I was facing hair fall sic ne the time my second child was born. I have tried almost everything under the sky. This shampoo was recommended by my friend who was facing the similar problem. No amount of oiling and other vitamin supplements  were helping. I was not very helpful that this shampoo will do anything spectacular. But then we all have different bodies and chemistry. After using it every alternate day for a month, I was forced to write this review. My hair fall has diminished to nothing. My hair feels stronger and extremely clean. The smell is very mild and works a good rather with cold and hot water.</li>
    <li> Just started using this, leaves hair fresh and it has a nice smell. Waiting for results..</li>
    <li> I had a hair loss scare about 3 months ago when the very top of my head began looking extremely thin compared to the other sections.  Have tried several different products before this one but none did anything that was actually noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months of using this and the top of my head literally does look much more full than it did 2 months ago.  If anything, the hair loss has come to a slow and steady stop while the hairs that used to be there seem to be regrowing themselves. I&#x27;m not saying that this shampoo is correlated with my decline in hair loss, but since taking it, the problem has pretty much come to a halt and that&#x27;s about all the certainty I need to be hooked on a product.</li>
    <li> I bought this August 2013.  Now, May 2014, the bottle is about 3/4 gone.  My husband and I both use it.  It just doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.  I will be purchasing again.  Initially, my husband was using H&amp;S, but when that was gone he switched.  He is happy with his results as dandruff has always been an issue for him.  The big difference I notice is the increased elasticity of my hair.  It just feels so much better wet or dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I have any more hair, but I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;m not losing hair like I was.</li>
    <li> As a guy who is very grudgingly going bald, I wanted to find a product that would slow or stop my hair loss.  However, I am leery of using some of the mainstream products, given that they can have some funky side effects.  I&#x27;m so glad I gave this more natural shampoo a try!  Although my hair is still thin, it no longer appears to be retreating.  Clean hair + less baldness &#x3D; win!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous hair loss prevention shampoos, ointments, etc...and some worked better then others, some not at all. Pura worked amazingly, within 10 days I noticed a significant difference.  Not only was my hair looking thicker but whatever is in also made it very smooth and feels amazing.  The wife loves it, nothing but positive comments from others around me.</li>
    <li> This product gets a 5-star because my hair was shedding like crazy. A week later the shedding pretty much stopped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I&#x27;m very susceptible when trying products, because all of the different chemicals that are in the products these days.  I absolutely love this shampoo, I can see major improvements with my hair, its softer and shines nicely, really easy to comb or brush.  My scalp is not flaky any more, it&#x27;s nice and clean.  Not having all those chemicals is a major plus. I&#x27;m very happy I found this product, would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for several months now.  What I love most about the shampoo is the incredible amount of lather I get from only a dime sized portion.  The benefit for me, and others, is not only is the shampoo luxurious, but it is also concentrated and economical.  The fragrance is subtle, yet very pleasant.  I love to shampoo my hair with Pura d&#x27;or because it feels like I am nurturing myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for hair loss, I guess the best thing I can say is that I don&#x27;t seem to be losing as much hair as I was prior to its use.  I seem to be maintaining.  I can&#x27;t say that I experience massive new hair grow and suddenly had a great full head of hair.  As I mentioned, I think the shampoo is holding the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product to others and firmly believe it has supported the good health of my scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical when a product states that it prevents hair loss almost as much as when a product states it will REGROW hair. It&#x27;s worth noting that the price of this product isn&#x27;t that high, so i decided to give it a go. The worst that can happen is I lose a few dollars and my hair looks a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself states that you should lather it up and leave in your scalp for a couple of minutes, which I did and then i rinsed and shampooed out. The whole process i guess helps in preventing occurring hair loss and maybe helping in growing hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for only 2 weeks, but i do see some small progress. My hairline loss has slowed somewhat, but i think I need to keep going for a few months to see if any regrowth occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I see that it works for some and not for others. All I can say is try it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> I was searching a good shampoo for long time and ordered this based on reviews, really it&#x27;s working great, my hair is very soft and smells good(mild),Thanks for the reviews to find the good.😄</li>
    <li> Shampoo feels and smells nice while using it, I just started a week ago so no tangible results yet.  I will report back down the road.</li>
    <li> It is supposed to be a shampoo but it does not lather and just sits in clumps. Makes your hair feel like you left a raw egg on it.</li>
    <li> My hair loss problem really made me crazy. I didn’t know what to do, so I decided to search for a preventive product on the internet. I am glad that finally I got hair loss prevention shampoo. I have been using it for a month and really love the cool shampoo. It is really effective and I can easily see the changes within this short period of time. Really an awesome product to get rid of hair loss!</li>
    <li> planning on getting more</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
    <li> Most of the beauty products include chemicals, so I try to avoid them. Actually, these chemicals often bring worse results. Let’s come to the point. I’ve been suffering from hair loss problems for the last couple of years. I didn’t care much and I knew that there was no perfect solution. A good shampoo could be useful I know. Actually, I thought was right and I got the perfect solution as a friend of mine recommended Pura d&#x27;or premium organic shampoo. I’ve been using it for the last few weeks and there is no hair loss problem now. Thanks Pura d&#x27;or!</li>
    <li> Tried two bottles and out a lot of money. My dermatologist suggested I not buy into miracle hype products and rely on scientific medical advice. Lesson learned for me.</li>
    <li> Totally amazing! Works well. Great results! :)</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shampoo. I love that it&#x27;s natural ingredients and I&#x27;m not losing as much hair since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle of shampoo yesterday and tried it this morning. The consistency is perfect; smooth-not too thick. I noticed immediately upon shampooing that this shampoo would be different from ones I&#x27;ve tried before...It cleaned my hair better than any other and when lathering, I could tell it was doing a thorough job. It doesn&#x27;t take but maybe a quarter size squirt to lather throughout the hair so that speaks to the lasting effects of the shampoo. I have tried countless shampoos for my oily, thinning hair and none have given me this kind of satisfaction. It detangled my hair too....great product and I&#x27;ll definitely be checking out their other line of products and re-ordering.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is a good product. I had a good experience  with it .my scalp felt clean and healthy . but I don&#x27;t think this shampoo is good enough for very greasy itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over 4 months now and I am very pleased.  I do notice a subtle change in my hair growth and I plan on continuing to use it long-term.  Obviously this is my own personal anecdote about the product and nothing will ever really prove their claims about hair growth like a large study, but what company has the funding for that?  I think for a shampoo, it is an excellent option if you are concerned about hair loss, but you should probably be realistic as far as the changes you expect to see, as with any shampoo product.  My hair feels softer and my scalp is not as dry and itchy as it used to be before using this shampoo.  The smell is not as pleasant as your typical shampoo but that is to be expected.  Overall I recommend this shampoo as an addition to your existing hair care regimen if hair loss is a concern.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male in my early thirties. I notice my mild hair loss and want to do something to prevent the hair loss and help my hair grow healthier. I&#x27;ve tried this shampoo for about a week and notice less hair loss. However, my hair loss is very mild to begin with. The main advantage of using this product is the knowledge that you are using something organic that can boost the health of your hair.</li>
    <li> I got 2 of these samples from 2 different places, and decided to try it. I have never tried oil before, my natural hair is VERY oily but my dyed hair is very dry. It is also curly and VERY frizzy! I can only brush my hair once a day when it is wet only or it is a big poof ball. Having said that I have to condition my hair when I wash it in order to brush it, as my hair curls into knots and bird nests! I washed my hair as usual and brushed and added the oil, it was soft, but what really surprised me is that i washed it the next day and did NOT use conditioner, and my hair was soft not in tangles and even without brushing it was soft not frizzy! I usually do not use conditioner when I put my hair up and I do not brush it as it will not stay! 3 days after I used it my hair is still soft and is not a tangled mess! I can not wait to buy this and I will never use conditioner again!</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner left my hair feeling sticky/dry and difficult to get a comb through after showering.  (Aveda hair loss shampoo left my hair feeling the same way) and I didn&#x27;t notice any new growth after 8 weeks.  This shampoo smells herbal and slightly medicinal but is in no way offensive.  The shampoo smells completely different than the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to original review:&lt;br /&gt;After about 8 weeks of use of this shampoo and conditioner, I didn&#x27;t really notice any change in my hair loss so I decided to go all natural with hair care.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this shampoo was all natural, but have since learned that any shampoo that foams/lathers contains some form of SLS (in this case cocamide) and strips the hair of all moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Morrocco Method shampoos for about two months, shampooing much less (twice a week), have used the hair detox 3 times and am using the scalp massager daily and brushing with a Mason Pearson brush.  I&#x27;m happy to say I now have lots of new hair growth!  Yea!!</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing I love this Shampoo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reordered this shampoo several times because it&#x27;s very gentle in my fine thinning hair.  I with through a period of stress and the shampoo didn&#x27;t prevent hair from falling out due to those circumstances but because it is very gentle (but still cleanse very well) it does prevent hair loss from harsh chemicals or dry hair.  I love their natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think this is working at all for me. Have been using it for 3 months; if anything this seems to make me lose more hair.</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for about 4 months now, i can say that there is literally no difference from using the product after 4 months, it does not help with any kind of thickening or hair growth, i switched to lipogaine shampoo and its actually helped i can see the difference, although i like the smell of the purr dor better it didn’t help me at all and was very expensive. I went to find that a lot of the 5 star reviews were actually fake and a lot of them were only 1 time review people who seemed to work for the company so i was very upset about that.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother because she has been losing a lot of hair.  My husband also uses this product.  Since we have switched to an organic SLS free shampoo it has been great.  So far my mother really likes it and my husband is a believer in organic sulfate free shampoo and conditioners.  After several months he actually has new hair growth.  It does not happen over night so be patient.  My mother just started using this and she didn&#x27;t have as much hair come out during her shampooing.  My mother only washes her hair once a week to prevent hair loss.  Highly recommend and will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use this brand of shampoo and conditioner and decided to switch to Fundamental Earth shampoo and conditioner and I personally, for my hair type, like it better. I have thick, course, frizzy, color treated hair.  If you don&#x27;t like this brand, you can give the Fundamental Earth a try.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> The most important thing for me was if it was for everyday use. I was pretty glad when I saw I have very less hair loss after I have used it for some period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic content of the shampoo does its job very well preventing the hair loss.It also strengthens my hair which is Awesome!</li>
    <li> Read reviews on the shampoo on Amazon and decided to try it.  It is a very nice mild shampoo with no harsh chemicals and is perfect for thinning hair. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I think this product works very well. It has a good smell and seems to help my hair stay thick; however, it is not a silver bullet for hair loss. I think people buy this product expecting it to manically grow their hair back and then give it a poor rating when it doesn&#x27;t. That always frustrates me as I don&#x27;t feel it is fair to give a product a negative review because the reviewer lacks common sense. If you think you are buying a silver bullet to reverse the genetic hair loss you are suffering from, I have some swampland in Florida that I want to sell you...and at a good price! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this probably won&#x27;t make a huge difference in your hair loss but it probably does slow down the process if you are losing hair from harsh ingredients in other shampoos or if you have excess DHT in your scalp. Nothing that you will be able to notice in any short period of time but if the product does gain you an extra six months of hair in your lifetime, and cleans your hair with natural ingredients during the process, it&#x27;s probably worth the cost...at least it is to me.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I didn&#x27;t realize that many of the products I use were drying out my hair.  I definitely see the value in not having the laureth sulfate.  I ran into another person who uses the pura product and was amazed at how good their hair looked as well.  Mine has never looked shinier or healthier.  I would recommend this to anyone especially if you have thin hair.  I feel like I&#x27;m feeding my scalp &amp; hair with good nutrition when I use it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I always stay up late and my hair loses fast. After using this product, I still stay up late but hair almost not reduce. Besides, I find much new hair is born. Really good one!</li>
    <li> First several months, it was good. But when I voted it 4 stars, the price went up! I want to share another concern is that I can not continue to use this product because my hair looks like grass. Too bad. I have to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle two month ago, and constantly use it on daily basis. I bought it cuz I ever used it last year and I felt it&#x27;s better than any shampoo else I&#x27;ve used in US. While interrupting usage for a while I do feel it strengthen my hair, I feel it thicker and less easy to drop in some aspect. Although the effectiveness can vary case by case I do feel this product earns its rating for good reason. Before I find anything even more powerful personally speaking this is the fine shot.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, as described, very good product!</li>
    <li> just started using; its helping; will buy more</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and use it primarily for volumizing/thickening and it has had some positive effect. I do have miniaturizing hairs in my corners, so as for hair loss, I am not seeing much new growth though.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with Kirkland Minoxidil. I am young and my hair loss was very noticeable but I was not completely bald in any area. With the two products my front hairline is filling in a lot more as well as the two spots in the rear of my head. There is no ONE solution to hair loss however with these two products I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002VLZHLI B002VLZHLI]]</li>
    <li> drying but perfect for preventing hair loss... my scalp feels stretched and dry but it&#x27;s very mild and no chemicals so works.. i use it almost eveyr day</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping I would recommend purchasing it. It  left my hair clean and full of volume  when my hair was dry. I am actually a returning customer, so I recommend  giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I used this with the Purador Conditioner and found that it left my hair very dry and stripped feeling.  I could barely get a brush through it and had to buy a spray leave in conditioner/detangler, just to brush it.  I love that it&#x27;s natural &amp; organic, but I actually found that I was losing more hair with it.  I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is up but this completely dries out my hair. Not sure it works well for fine straight locks.</li>
    <li> We purchased two 16 ounce bottles of this product and were very satisfied with the results.  My 66-year old husband had been experiencing hair loss and with the combination of Pura d&#x27;Or, Rogaine and Propecia, his hair loss has completely reversed and is growing in beautifully, much thicker.  As for myself, I feel my hair is thicker and healthier on the Pura d&#x27;Or as well.  We are purchasing again and will continue using this product.  Just one note:  Don&#x27;t expect foam with the first lathering of this product.  You will get it with the second lathering of the product, however, and your hair will be nice and clean.</li>
    <li> I could tell a difference in my hair from the first wash.  I haven&#x27;t had a shampoo like this in a very long time.</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase. Lathers well. Only have to  use a little  at a time. So works well for the price. All ingredients seem authentic  and has hair feeling clean. No high perfume smell.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this shampoo after reading the glowing reviews. What a disappointment. I used the entire bottle and it did nothing for my hair loss. Nor did it leave my hair feeling softer. I liked the natural ingredients but for the cost and claims made on the bottle I really expected to see *some* decrease in my hair loss. Nope.. And no little baby hairs sprouting either. Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a fortune on supplements, vitamins, hair loss products only to find out that an auto immune disease is the culprit of my hair falling out like a birds nest in the shower. Moral of this review is that losing tons of hair is not normal-especially for women. Dig deeper to find the root cause.</li>
    <li> The shampoo frozen within three months .....Its all stringy and I cant use it anymore...waste of money...</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this is the only shampoo that makes my hair look thick. But it only lasts about a day before I need to take a shower again.</li>
    <li> I was losing hair a few month back and this product helped with minimizing the hair loss back then. My family and a couple of friends have ordered this product since then and they love it. I missed out on a deal on Groupon but I will be purchasing it again. However, I have had increasing hair loss again and I get scared washing my hair due to the significant amounts of hair just stripping away from my scalp. I might be using this everyday just to see how it can help but I believe it helps.</li>
    <li> Great product, gives great volume and it seems to be working as expected!</li>
    <li> So, I bought this as my hair started thinning.  I had never really thought about what was in my shampoo bottle, but the more research I did the more it seemed smart to use a more natural shampoo.  I don&#x27;t take any pills, or rub any sorts of oils into my skin to stop my thinning hair.  Instead, I use this and the conditioner equivalent.  So, long story short, I bought it and started using it for a couple of months.  I really noticed no difference, and figured I would just use the bottles up then switch back to normal shampoo or some cheaper shampoo.  Now, about 5 months after I began using it, I actually notice a pretty major difference.  My hair has gotten some volume back (not a ton, but definitely noticeable to people other than myself), and it grows WAY faster (I used to get a hair cut every six weeks, now I&#x27;m to about every 4).  The only downside is it really dries out your scalp, so get the conditioner and maybe use Head and Shoulders once or twice a week.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great product worth your money, just be patient and understand you won&#x27;t see results right away (but will definitely see them before you run out of a bottle...I&#x27;m 5 months in and still have about a quarter of a bottle left).</li>
    <li> One try, clumps of hair fell out after use, left hair very dry. Money in the garbage never again</li>
    <li> I used this daily for 3 week&#x27;s.My hair seems to have a more natural look to it. Hair does not have that waxy buildup feeling.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product at first. My hair was falling out in clumps from stress and anemia, and this helped a lot with the rate of fall out. But it&#x27;s REALLY drying for both hair and scalp, which makes sense for people whose hair loss is from a too-oily scalp. I have dry, itchy scalp from seborrheic dermatitis and this exacerbated it greatly after a few weeks, plus made my hair really dry. I switched to Nioxin step 4 and it&#x27;s worked a lot better for me. I would recommend this for people with oily scalps, though.</li>
    <li> No real difference in hair. Very drying.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me - I actually noticed more hair in my sink when using it</li>
    <li> I thought I was purchasing a shampoo - but instead it leaves a greasy film on my hair..... I tried drying my hair and it would hardly dry - b/c it was so greasy - so I had to rewash my hair with other shampoo after drying it after realizing what this shampoo does to the hair #irritated :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this product over  a month, I still see some hair loss while shampoo my hair, it is hard to tell how well it works, it is a little pricey, but I like the smell though.</li>
    <li> My hair is definitely softer and it feels a lot gentler than traditional stuff. I have thinning hair and have noticed it appearing a tad thicker. Nothing magical but noticeable.</li>
    <li> Great Product. The ingredients look great and are all there for the purpose this shampoo was built for. No SLS or harsh chemicals. On first use, you&#x27;ll notice the product smells great (often organic shampoo&#x27;s like this dont) and feels great in your hair. I used to get very dry hair/a flaky scalp after using hair products. This shampoo is a great solution and works wonders on your hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks so far and my hair has never felt more nourished and full. Bit pricey, but I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> IM NOT SURE IF IT DOES MUCH OR NOT, THE INGREDIENTS ARE GOOD DONT GET ME WRONG AND MAYBE I DIDNT GIVE IT ENOUGH TIME AND AM NOT USING IT AS MUCH AS I USE THE REVITA FROM DS LABS, BUT I KINDA FEEL THE REVITA IS DOING A BETTER JOB, BUT THAT COULD BE BECAUSE IT HAS THAT CHEMICAL IN IT THAT STARTS WITH A LETTER K WHICH GIVES IT A BETTER EFFECT, AND MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE COPPER TECHNOLOGY WHICH LETS ALL ITS INGREDIENTS ACTUALLY PENITRATE UNDERNEATH THE SCALP AND SKIN, I THINK IF THIS PURA D OR WOULD START USING THAT SAME TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR SHAMPOO AND ADD THAT CHEMICAL WITH THE LETTER K WHICH I CANT EVEN PRONOUNCE IT WOULD BE A 5STAR FORMULA JUST SAYING, OTHER THAN THAT ITS GREAT :-)..</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. I bleach my hair to platinum blonde so my hair falls our easily but this shampoo is helping me. I&#x27;ts great I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Before using this product, I lost a lot of hair when I washed hair. I tried many products, but no one was better than this one!! With this product, I feel the hair loss is reduced to half. The product smells herbal and natural to me. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 6 months and I love it.  Within the first month I noticed a difference in my hair.  It was thicker and had more volume as well as less hair was falling out.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! Just started using it and can already feel the difference in hair health. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like previous shampoos. Great results when paired with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like anything organic but this is much better than using name brand shampoos which use SRS.  However the odor is VERY strong, so I highly suggest that you get the conditioner to correct that.  The shampoo lathers very well so the size of the bottle will last a while.  And my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few month now.  It is difficult to say at this point if this shampoo does what it is intended for, but I haven&#x27;t lost any additional hair and the shampoo has a great smell.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t possibly tell you if this works or not. How could I know if I&#x27;m losing hair at a slower pace than I would be without it? Four stars cuz... I Iike the smell.</li>
    <li> I was taking some medication and in a situation of some duress that caused some stress-related hairloss. It may have also been a prolonged and unnecessary use of Head and Shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo (using it because I had it and not really giving a damned that it wasn&#x27;t a good idea to use it regularly). In any case, I was developing these large blotches of thinning hair on either side of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a bargain shampoo guy. I have maybe taken hair for granted and not given much care to the appearance or maintenance of my coif. However, preventing further hair loss was enough of a priority that I pulled the trigger on this and I&#x27;m glad I did. It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, obviously, but after only a few weeks of use (I have even missed a few days), I can see my follicles resuming hair production. My balding spots are filling in. Even one 16 year old bald spot that was the result of an electric razor yanking out my hair follicles during a hazing incident seems to be coughing up some sprouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth noting that I began taking Omega 7 (sourced from anchovies, not sea buckthorn) around the same time and it is supposed to be good for hair and skin. However, even if this is what is responsible or a synergy of the two is what is responsible, my bald spot has gone from being alarming to being concealable and I expect it to go back to normal with continued use. Also, the scent and feel of this stuff is invigorating. It reminds me of those Herbal Essences commercials when they first came out. I&#x27;d still prefer sex in the shower over shampoo, probably, but this stuff is a close second and might win in some cases.</li>
    <li> It is good to fight against hair loss. I can see less Hair fall after the second time use. great shampoo!</li>
    <li> Used this shampoo and my  hair has never felt heather and alive. I really was shocked by how much livelier my hair has been these past few weeks. I found this product extremely excellent and highly effective. Would buy again!!</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t let me down yet. Although the pump doesnt pump well I can make do. This product is a keeper. I always have little to no hair loss while using it and my hair feels full and soft. I have very baby fine hair and it doesnt leave it heavy or dry. I recommend giving it a try if you are losing hair or have thin hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this due to the fact that my IUD causes my hair to fall out!  I was not looking for some miracle product to super grow my hair, just something to stop the hair fall.  My hair is REALLY fine and any hair loss is pretty detrimental.  This seems to do the job, not amazing but seems to work.  Probably try something else next time. Did NOT care for the botanical sent.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I noticed my hair seemed to be getting thinner and losing volume. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was because I was losing hair or if it had something to do with the water I wash my hair in. After using this shampoo I did get more volume back in my hair right away. Since it contains only natural ingredients, I wasn&#x27;t worried about it damaging my hair. I would recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s having a problem with hair loss or just wants to add more volume to their hair. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day, so you can maintain the results you get.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo when i was looking for chemical free hair products. I was moved by all those positive reviews and decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo comes in, exactly as pictured. After using this for a while now, i do feel that my hair has become healthier than before.&lt;br /&gt;I could not say that there is a reduction in hair loss, it remains the same, no more no less. However i could see new tiny hairs around my forehead area and that is interesting. I don&#x27;t have any other hair issue and i tried this shampoo only to get rid of the ones with harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;This has a mild fragrance which is not the best but definitely acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This product claims to prevent hair loss, which may work in many, but in my case i am waiting to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;2. Shampoo claims to support healthy hair growth and yes, i have seen the results myself.&lt;br /&gt;3. Best part is that you get the satisfaction that you use the shampoo that is chemical-free and is also good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;4. Price, i feel this is little overpriced comparing the long time it takes to give you actual results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a nice product and definitely well worth a try if you are suffering from serious hair issues.&lt;br /&gt;This has definitely helped in maintaining healthier hair. I will continue buying this product, and i hope to see changes in the hair loss pattern soon.&lt;br /&gt;The review shall be updated again later.</li>
    <li> A good buy. My hair got shiny and soft, manageable and healthy.  Nice silky hair.  All natural shampoo.  I am happy that tried this shampoo.  It really works and makes my hair look very healthy.  When I shampoo my rapidly thinning hair in the shower.  It feels comfortable.  I love this shampoo!  Very good shampoo, my hair looks amazing.  A great product.  My hair feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It makes my hair feel soft and silky. My scalp feels nourished and clean. I have fine hair and I love how full my hair feels after it&#x27;s dry whether I use the blower or just air dry. I&#x27;m so glad I found this on line. Has saved me time and money. Thank you very much for a great product.</li>
    <li> really to early to tell if this product works as advertised since I just received it, smells good just hope it works as well as it is advertised</li>
    <li> I have been using for months now.  Have about 1/4 of a bottle left.  No visible difference to my hair thickness or amount of hair.  No new growing, probably some additional fallen out.  Switched from Nioxen because it makes my hair quite frizzy.  No noticeable difference between the two.&lt;br /&gt;Is it a good shampoo...sure&lt;br /&gt;Will it grow hair...not for me&lt;br /&gt;Will it keep hair from falling out...Eh...probably just as good as any other shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Will try the gold label next.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work for me ,, besides i got alot dandruff after using it .</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works great for dandruff.  After a couple of use, I noticed that my scalp does not itch at all and no more snow flakes on my shoulders.</li>
    <li> Fake reviews?  This shampoo didn&#x27;t decrease my hair loss at all.  It doesn&#x27;t lather well or smell good, and it leaves my hair feeling like hay.  After shampooing, I have to use copious amounts of heavy conditioner to restore moisture to my hair.</li>
    <li> it worked for my moms. Her hair really looks healthier in one month. On the other hand it totally distorted my hair on 2 month!!! My mom live outside of USA. I live in the USA. Could be this because of what we are eating or because of the weather or nature?????Idk... Any way I stopped to use it...</li>
    <li> only reason i gave 4 stars and not 5 was because of the smell. smells like veggies. and id prefer a flower smell. but my hubbby uses it and likes it. he is using it to grow out his hair.  very healthy shampoo! i would use it.  then id use a conditioner that would make my hair smell good.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was starting to lose my heir. I found out that cheap over the counter products had chemicals that were harmful to my  susceptible skin. After using this product not only I stop losing hair but it grew back. I was concern that the cost of the item was going to be excessive but if it is used as directed it can last a very long time.</li>
    <li> OMG this shampoo is AMAZING!!!! I don&#x27;t see anymore hair on my brush or comb, but I haven&#x27;t seen any fullness to my hair like it was mentioned.  I don&#x27;t believe any product can produce more hair.  The price isn&#x27;t too bad either.  I will be buying more of the shampoo and conditioner.  In fact, I have decided to give this as a gift to our son for his birthday.  So very happy I found Pura d or.  Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Fast service great product.</li>
    <li> Good, but use with a conditioner to keep from drying out scalp.</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells like argan oil; does prevent hair loss after using for a week.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 2 months and I can clearly see the difference  of my hair loss.It reduced hair loss remarkably.I am very happy that ultimately I found a good shampoo for my hair which has no harsh chemicals.I love the fragrance too.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling really soft and feels a lot thicker after using. I hope this stuff helps to make my hair thicker!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it really works or not. How can I tell???</li>
    <li> When I was in the market for an organic, all natural, DHT blocking shampoo I was led to Pura d&#x27;Or and I am not disappointed. This 16 oz. container will last you a very long time. I can&#x27;t even squeeze out an amount small enough to be the least amount necessary. It suds up well and a minuscule amount will easily lather your entire head. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, so I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of its DHT blocking, but the ingredients check out and my hair feels great after using it. I love this product for the organic shampoo it is though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If used in conjunction with Ketaconazole shampoo, finasteride tablets (generic prescription Propecia), and Minoxodil (Rogaine) you could reverse your hair loss and grow back that lost hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unlikely this item will reverse the process on its own, but it may decelerate hair loss.</li>
    <li> I only had 2 days so no results yet. Shampoo does feel nice though so far. Will update in a week or 2 when i got more use.</li>
    <li> Wow, amazing amazing shampoo. I seriously stopped having hair loss after I started using this shampoo, and I had tried to so many other ones prior to this one. Well done pura d&#x27;or. I&#x27;m buying this for life!</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for several years but I had noticed more hair falling out in recent months.  I put this down to a fact of life until I found out that Nioxin had been bought out some time ago by Procter and Gamble and that the original formula had been changed.  I had some older smaller bottles I use for travel and compared them to newer bottles.  I discovered all the old references to hair loss were no longer on the label either.  I did some research and this came up with some decent reviews.  It was kinda pricey for the amount you got (it is a little over double the cost of Nioxin) but I decided it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;The Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of use I can definitely say that my hair loss has significantly decreased.  Where I was constantly finding my hair on my desk at work, I am now just occasionally finding a stray hair.  There is definitely less hair in the comb when I get out of the shower also.  I have not noticed any drying as others have experienced but my scalp is generally pretty oily so that was not surprising.  I can&#x27;t attest to any new hair growth as of yet but I&#x27;d say it is way to early to make that kind of determination.&lt;br /&gt;As to the cost, while by volume Nioxin was definitely cheaper I am finding it takes about half as much Pura d&#x27;or to achieve the same lather so in that I&#x27;d say the cost is about the same when you factor in the number of uses yo get out of each.  Overall I am pretty happy with it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a month since I have started using this shampoo.  I suppose that may not be long enough to give a definitive review, but so far I am liking it.  To me, the smell is pleasant and reminds me almost like a licorice (which is strange because I don&#x27;t necessarily like licorice but I enjoy the smell of this shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using this shampoo I noticed that my hair seemed wiry and thin (talking about each strand).  At this point, I cannot say that my hair is thick by any standard but it seems softer and less wiry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about this shampoo is that I don&#x27;t have to use much at all.  One push of the pump puts out about a nickel to quarter-size amount of shampoo and it lathers up very well to be more than enough for me.  After a month, the level of shampoo left is right under the top of the label so I&#x27;m hoping one bottle will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions on the bottle say to lather up and let sit for 2 minutes so I&#x27;ve just changed my shower routine to lathering my hair first, then doing the body wash thing, and rinsing at the end - seems to be just the right amount of time and doesn&#x27;t extend shower time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying this product, I&#x27;d say at least buy one bottle and give it a shot.  At this point I&#x27;m thinking this will be my shampoo of choice from now on.</li>
    <li> I purchased one bottle and was skeptical at first, but it seems to work.  I had been shedding a lot of hair, particularly in the winter, and after using this shampoo for a while it seemed that I was shedding less and my hair seemed fuller.  It also cleans hair well (I wash daily) relative to some of the other shampoos I&#x27;ve used (Pantene Pro-V, Garnier Fructis).</li>
    <li> so far, so good...  I like that the shampoo seems to give my hair much needed moisture.  I am surprised that only a small amount is needed to really coat my head, which makes me feel like it is not so expensive after all.  I am hoping it helps to grow more hair but only time will tell.  I have been using it for a few weeks and need to give it more time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now in my early 40&#x27;s and i&#x27;m not shedding any hair. During my 30&#x27;s I would continually lose hair, in the sink, shower, floor you name it. I cant say I&#x27;ve grown hair back but no doubt in my mind I&#x27;ve slowed hair loss either significantly or completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How you may ask? Stacking 2 products:&lt;br /&gt;1. Pura d&#x27;or shampoo&lt;br /&gt;2. Minoxidil 5%, once daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont use any shampoo now other than Pura d&#x27;or and I have travel containers filled for when I travel on business.&lt;br /&gt;Just my opinion but no doubt in my mind it is working.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it!</li>
    <li> I loved the way this shampoo made my hair feel. Clean without feeling stripped basically but I can&#x27;t say for sure if it really reduced the amount of hair I lost.</li>
    <li> I had just bought a hair loss shampoo &amp; conditioner and was searching the web to see if ingredients were more harmful than helpful when I found a site listing top 5 best shampoo for hair loss. I was SO desperate, I figured what the heck (every time I washed my hair then combed it, I lost so much, 2 Barbie dolls could&#x27;ve been made). In LESS THAN A WEEK, I had almost no hair in my hands! My comb had NOTHING! Even the shower drain barely had anything.&lt;br /&gt;The other hair loss shampoo and conditioner? Gave it away! I will NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE!</li>
    <li> Not sure how well it works but seems as though it helps.</li>
    <li> So glad I came across this Shampoo after a few uses I started noticing the thickness in my hair. I also love the way it lathers... a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling smooth and airy, not heavy or with a residue build-up, like other hair thickening shampoos I have tried. I love the smell and the full body feeling it gives my hair without the frizz. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair feels after using it only a short time.  I&#x27;m not sure I love it because it&#x27;s too soon to see what it does about hair loss.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> This shampoo gives my hair a soothing coolness when I&#x27;m using it.  My hair feels clean and fresh when it&#x27;s dry.  I do follow it with a conditioner to ensure my long hair combs through smoothly when done.  I have noticed that my hair loss has been less even though I have kept it long while trying this treatment.  I&#x27;m very happy with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Took a while to notice a difference. My hair still isn&#x27;t as full and thick as it used to be however after two months of using this product there is definitely much less hair loss...I&#x27;m slowly getting back to normal!</li>
    <li> When I used this I had little to no hair in the drain after showering. I usually shed a lot. it seemed to hold in the hair I had, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also severely dried my scalp. Now I alternate it with a moisturizing shampoo and rarely have trouble with dry skin on my scalp</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks thus far - but I have to say that I am loving it.  Yes, it was more expensive than I&#x27;d really like to pay for a shampoo - but I feel it&#x27;s working already.  I am not sure if it growing any of the spots of my hair that have thinned out (the reason I purchased this shampoo) but it has made it healthier and appear and feel fuller.  Also, a few people have already mentioned how quickly my hair seems to be growing (getting longer).  So, I will continue to use this and hope I keep getting the awesome results I feel I already am.</li>
    <li> so far I have not noticed any additional receding of hair. I have been using the product for about 4-5 months now and it seems to be working from what I can tell so far. I like the scent, and the easy pump application. I will no more with continued use and months/years from now. But, it does seem to be working.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars, but, perhaps in year from now, I will be able to give it 5 stars if I continue to see no additional hair loss.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how it affects my hair loss but I get lots of compliments from my hair dresser when I am using it. It gives my hair volume without frizzy ends. Overall it is an excellent shampoo and I am a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> good stuff, i like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my hair is thinning, and there were positive reviews for this product.  It seems to be making my hair fuller, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really preventing my hair loss.  The scent took a bit to get used to but now I like it.  The bottle also seems to last quite awhile.</li>
    <li> This is yet another great natural shampoo I have used because I don&#x27;t like any of those my stylist tries to get me to buy and are loaded with SLS, parabens and who knows what else(?)  I like Argan oil and use it as a prewash conditioner for scalp/hair.  The shampoo has a pleasant smell and cleans to my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Horrible shampoo. Smells like dog shampoo and it matted my hair</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s working or not, but it does have a nice feel to it, and my hair feels good after using it.</li>
    <li> The first time I am writing a review about something I bought.  STAY AWAY...wost shampoo ever. I have thinning hair. I got this shampoo because of the positive reviews. My hair loss was never been this worst and I swear I lost other half of my hair. I have been using it for 3 months and my hair loss not even decreased a bit but increased immensely.</li>
    <li> I reason that I purchase this shampoo is because I have a problem of hair loss. I have been using it for about 2 months, I am experiencing a reduction of hair loss so far which is great. I use this along with the conditioner as well. So far, I am happy with this product, it has a gentle smell, but not too long that can last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Have been using this since Febuary 15th , my hair is noticable thinning back about an inch from where it has been.I Have not completly used the bottle has 20% of it left i shampoo once to twice a day.No need to say i am pissed i paid so much for this garbage shampoo and my hair looks worse.Would have been better to just not care and go to a one dollar bottle and just let it fall out on me.</li>
    <li> Although I was using this shampoo only for a month I cannot really tell if it is working as it should but I like it in general. Makes your hair sharply smooth. Smells like thyme. It is essential to use conditioner with this product as well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t lather; hair was unmanageable after using the product.  so unmanageable, many strands of hair actually fell out.  Returned product, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I made this review after using it for nearly two months. It did improve the health of my hairs and I still wait to see if it would eventually make my hairs regrow. But honestly, I don&#x27;t think it would, otherwise it will become a true revolutionary product. Anyway, making my hairs healthy is all I need. From this perspective, it works very well.</li>
    <li> A little drying for daily use.  I use once or twice a week for best results but must use conditioner for detangling.</li>
    <li> Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;I like this organic shampoo and conditioner works will with my fine hair and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy this Shampoo and Conditioner again. I recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product!</li>
    <li> makes hair feel nice.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. Within days it started working and the amount of my hair loss now is minimal. I use to have huge balls of hair come out in the shower, a lot of hair loss when I would comb. I have lost so much hair in the last year it is embarrassing. I have tried everything including supplements along with scalp treatments but nothing was working. One thing I do is I shampoo my hair in the sink and then leave it on longer than they say to, about 10min. Then I shower and wash it out. I do have to use a conditioner because you will not be able to comb your hair out if you don&#x27;t. I use a conditioner that also works to promote hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I love the product and will never stop using it.</li>
    <li> The smell is not very nice.  It smells like tea tree oil.  I purchased this because I have more hair fall than average.  I have seen no difference in hair fall or the overall health of my hair.  My hair is not chemically treated and is otherwise damage-free.  Overall, the shampoo cleans as it should, but with no other results; I won&#x27;t spend the money to purchase again.</li>
    <li> actually i m not sure if it stop hair loss or not because i did use beside a hair loss medicine (tonic). my hair stopped&lt;br /&gt;fall down after using those.  but i like how it wash my hair with too much foam i feel it very clean but kinda make it dry a lil bit.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product based on the reviews I saw online and it is Best shampoo ever.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I will never use another shampoo product again! My hair is fuller and is not falling out like it used to!</li>
    <li> I started using this about one month ago and pleased about the results. Waiting to see more positive results. Each time I buy a new product for my hair, I really get scary to try it on me ( as some of them worsen the situation). I am glad that this one did not do any harm so far. I feel the volume of my hair is increased. I would definitely continue this one, and would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> After using a number of other hair care products, Pura d&#x27;or is the only one I&#x27;ve truly seen results from stopping my hair loss, and preventing further loss as well. I strongly recommend it! Read my review on the Anti-Hair Loss bottle to get more details about my raging success with this product!</li>
    <li> Helped my hair a lot!</li>
    <li> First, it smells awful, second, it leaves my long hair a ratted, knotted mess and it requires double the conditioner afterwards to undo the tangled mess.  But, I have noticed less fallout in my shower, for girls with long hair, you&#x27;ll notice when not as many hairs run down your back in the shower, so for that, I will give it 3 stars, I have been using it for 1 week, so maybe with longer use no hair will run down my back in the shower?!  About the smell, it is not tea tree, which I can stand, it smells like old dried sage, but extremely intense, it is not pleasant in the least.  It&#x27;s got the consistency of argan oil, so picture trying to spread that around your head evenly, not very easy, and if you have any length hair other than a mans&#x27;, this bottle will not last for the 3 months it claims it will, it will last about a month, month and a half, tops.  BUT, if it does stop my hair fallout and help to stop the thinning, and maybe regrow some, then will definitely give it 5 stars, even if it does feel and smell awful.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice any changes besides more hair fall</li>
    <li> I got this together with the Conditioner and its just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;First i had some with hemp from an other brand but it didnt worked well with my skin :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But im very happy with this product now and i can recommend it to everyone :)</li>
    <li> This shampoo was the simple solution to my problems.  I was skeptical at first but I&#x27;ve notice less hair in the drain now and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking that it would probably be like all the others Ive tried in treating my bery thin, baby fine hair.  But I have been so pleasantly surprised!  I find that my hair (after using it just two months), appears thicker and healthier.  And I had compliments from others asking what I&#x27;ve done differently to my hair.  Is it the cut, the color?  No, I believer it&#x27;s due to this product.  I will be purchasing more of this soon!</li>
    <li> Simply put, I love it. This brand is really amazing. I have used this product for about 2 weeks now, and my hair is looking fuller. It also smells nice and makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 59 year old male. I noticed over past few years my hair thinning out. I started searching for something to remedy this. I tried a few other products with no success. I came across this product on Amazon and was impressed with the reviews. I thought I would give it a shot. I received my first bottle in early November 2014 and have been using it since. I have noticed a big improvement in my hair. I have been receiving compliments on my hair from both genders. The woman who cuts my hair tells me whatever I&#x27;m doing to it keep it up. Important.....make sure you leave it on for recommended 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> first of all, let me tell you this stuff works for me!&lt;br /&gt;at first i was quite hesitant getting this product  i thought it wouldn&#x27;t work on me... since it was small invesment i thought id try it out...i can already see some improvement with my hair loss issue. made my hair smoother and shiny and  healthy look...not to mention it smells good.. i recommend this product! i&#x27;ll be getting another bottle soon!</li>
    <li> Wow I&#x27;m really amazed how great this product worked. I was a little skeptical at first after reading the reviews but I figured it was a small investment so I went for it! Glad I did it worked great and am still continuing to use it!! I would recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with P&#x27;ura D&#x27;or Argan Oil, and they work well together. So my first suggestion, for anyone thinking of trying either of these products out, is to use both of them, for full effect. Now, for the shampoo. My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out much (it is quite thick), and it&#x27;s too early to comment on that, but I will say that my hair seems much stronger than it used to be since I started using this. I could tell by the ingredients that it would be great for my hair, but I didn&#x27;t think my hair actually needed any strengthening, so I was surprised by that. It is also much softer and easier to style. In the future I will buy it from Amazon (it is pricier at other sites), but I will definitely be buying again as the changes are positive, and it&#x27;s difficult for me to find shampoos that actually work with my hair.</li>
    <li> I was also loosing a lot of hair. I really dont know if it´s the shampoo, but I´m seeing less hair in the shower, my wife is also very happy with the results as she feels her hair is thicker and healthier. We just bought ou second bottle and hope we continue with the same results.</li>
    <li> Started using this during postnatal hormonal hair loss. I started noticing it working within weeks (although it could have been hormonal). I have always had thin hair so I didn&#x27;t expect to suddenly have thick locks, but I did notice new growth and my lifelong &amp;#34;baby hairs&amp;#34; along my hairline are actually growing! I&#x27;m still using this after about six months mostly because I love the smell and that its all natural. Along with jojoba oil, I&#x27;ve been able to eliminate conditioner and most hair products as well! Love love love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked for a natural shampoo that actually lathers and makes my hair feel clean instead of heavy and gross. It also smells great, like a very citrusy green tea or something to me. I have extremely fine/thin hair and it gets very oily at the roots so I have to wash my hair every day. I also have some natural curl that tends to make parts of my hair unruly and frizzy and this shampoo works really well for that too. I&#x27;ve been trying to switch to more natural bath products as much as possible and shampoo/conditioner has been the hardest by far. For years I&#x27;ve had to use head and shoulders clinical strength because of seborrheic dermatitis and this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that I can use in place of that and not have severe problems with my scalp. I would definitely recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am so thrilled over this shampoo! I honestly never thought there was anything out there that would stop or at least help with hair lose.&lt;br /&gt;It has been embarrassing to have people picking hair off the back of my shirt because I had brushed through my hair and my hair would just fall out, and I have long hair so you can just imagine how aggravating that has been.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Pura for 7 weeks now and I have seen an enormous difference. I can now brush through my hair and it feels smooth and not falling out all over my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been trying it too because he has issues with dandruff, we just figured that it would help him out with that, and it does. He hasn&#x27;t had any dandruff issues; we are both very happy over this and I plan to buy more soon!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement or new hair growing.  It just clean the hair</li>
    <li> I am not continuous user of this product but in some way helped me reducing my hair fall.&lt;br /&gt;I think it works</li>
    <li> Hair loss products are such an individual thing, but I can attest that this product is working for me so far.  My hair has stopped falling out and is thicker overall.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I use it all the time and I take [[ASIN:B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]] with it every day I have used them both for about 4 months now and I cant believe how good my hair looks. It stopped falling out, and its really healthy now. Best hairloss combo!</li>
    <li> Since high school I&#x27;ve dealt with my hair thinning at times then improving itself. However, over the years and after having three children I was beginning to lose hope on having my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; thickness back. I read the reviews for this product and thought &amp;#34;what the heck, it can&#x27;t get worse.&amp;#34; I have now been using this shampoo for about three months now and all I can say is &amp;#34;Finally!!!&amp;#34; I have little baby hairs all around my hairline (my worst area) and an extreme reduction in loss when brushing, styling or even shampooing. It has been a gradual increase but I noticed a change about 1 1/2 months in. I also took the advice of another reviewer and have been taking a super B complex vitamin and Vitamin E every morning. I am ordering another bottle of the shampoo and I&#x27;m going to try the conditioner as well. Oh for reference, my hair length is pretty long (mid back) and my husband has been using the shampoo here and there as well and I&#x27;m just now needing more (3months). So while the price isn&#x27;t the best, it does go a long way. I highly recommend trying this product and I hope it works for you as well. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about half a year, the result is not very obious, but it does seem to have some improvement.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I use it all the time it really does make your hair grow faster and fuller. I tried so many other products but once I found this I never looked back.</li>
    <li> Great product- don&#x27;t need to use a lot, just take a little. Smell is great. However it is NOT organic (it sounds like one though)</li>
    <li> Recently opened a new bottle. Product formula must have been changed. More like water not silky gel texture. Extremely disappointed. I have tried it for a few weeks, can notice more hair falling. The previous formula did wonders for my hair. I had almost no fall out. It&#x27;s a shame that I will have to research and look for a new shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One buyer is spot on with the picture comparison on the tissue paper. I have been using this product since  2014 and was very satisfied.  Company needs to go back to the old formula!!!!</li>
    <li> The smell was very different from a previous order of the same product.</li>
    <li> I initially came across this product when I saw it on Groupon so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Boy was I impressed! So much so that while I was raving about it my wife decided to give it a try and now she doesn&#x27;t use any other brand either. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will instantly regrow your hair then you&#x27;ve got the wrong expectations. With this product, regular use will guarantee positive results after a few weeks to months of use. Plus, it&#x27;s completely natural and organic without any other harshness. One thing to note about it is it does leave the hair a bit dry but if you use a decent moisturizing conditioner then you will be fine.</li>
    <li> I was eager to try Pura D’ or’s products. Their choice of oil is Argan and so far this oil has been one of my favorites. My drawer looks like a science lab with different colored bottles, which all have droppers as dispensers, to even a roller ball one for my Maracuja oil. Argan has been the oil for me that super moisturizers but remains light on the skin to the point as the hours pass, more absorbs until it disappears. I like this type of nourishment/moisture and especially for overnight beauty treatments. The Moroccan oil has become more prevalent and now used in more mainstream product lines, like Josie Maran. It’s popularity is welcoming and scary because that also means price points go up for this beneficial oil and quality becomes suspect as it gets diluted with other oils, and not so good ingredients. Pura D’ or is a company that has embraced this one oil and infused all their products with 100% cold-pressed Argan oil. That is a great beginning, so I was lucky to able to try three of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo comes in large bottle with a top, which features a pump dispenser. I have very long hair (waist length) and found that 1/2 a pump was all I needed to get a satisfying amount of lather and even distribution. The scent of the product can be described sort of like a blend of herbs, and I enjoyed how my hair felt when I rinsed. My hair was not left over stripped of oils and dry. I only washed once every time I showered because for me two washes was not necessary and I find this is a major culprit to drying out one’s scalp. I just leave the shampoo on for 3 minutes and focus on softly lathering (don’t get crazy with your nails against your scalp) and I’m done. I used the product for 2 weeks to get an idea on performance and if I saw differences in my hair’s health. I did not experience build-up but did regain some lost luster and shine that started to suffer from all this bouncing weather we have been experiencing in California. I also found that I was less prone to static and I did not experience any dryness on both my hair or scalp.  The shampoo states it prevents hair-loss and since I am not experiencing any, I can’t comment in it’s performance in that area. I received the above product(s) free of charge from Pura D&#x27; or.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen hair loss prevention by using 1 bottle. But this one doesn&#x27;t contain silicon. It is a health shampoo. Want to try another bottle for the future results.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product. I noticed more body in my hair from day 1. I have only been using it for aprox 2 weeks so I can&#x27;t really say much. The only other thing that I noticed is an itchy scalp - especially at night.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple months now along with Rogaine. I think it working so far in stopping my hair loss. Will use a couple months more to see if my hair will regrow.</li>
    <li> Very strong scent, eucalyptus I think.  On-line description does not tell of this.  Did not use product as we are allergic to eucalyptus.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo!! It&#x27;s not heavy and it leaves my hair feeling clean yet still smooth. I&#x27;ve noticed that I have less fly-aways, and my split ends are much less noticeable which is a plus because I use flat irons and blow dryers; all bad. Besides that, not as much hair down my drain! This really does work for hair regrowth! Even more, a little goes a long way. Now if only this came in other scents then I&#x27;d go crazy for this brand :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> This is one of best shampoo I have tried. Moisture and non-grease compared to other shampoo I have used before. I like it smell and the important of this shampoo was organic and feeling free to applying on my hair highly recommended for those girl who have long hair and hairs were falling all the time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first maybe because I wasn&#x27;t used to the type. However, after continuously using it for about a month, I have noticed that my hair is fuller and seemed stronger. It does not make my hair shiny as I expected.</li>
    <li> It works horrible! Never buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for more than a year and I love it.  I am 74 years and I still have a good head of hair.  Last year I noticed considerable thinning and I was afraid it was going to continue.  That&#x27;s when I found Pura d&#x27;or on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  A little goes a long way and I use it daily.  Now on my third bottle.</li>
    <li> I only used this product a few times and it has made a difference. I had to use more than other shampoos in  order for it to lather.&lt;br /&gt;The  pump top was broken, so it is hard to pour into my hand. Iam not sure yet if I will  purchase  this product again.</li>
    <li> Good product just be patient it takes quite a few months to see results.  I suggest you take before and after pics every six months.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no way to actually know that it&#x27;s working but even if it doesn&#x27;t it smells nice :-)  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken this product along with biotin and my hair is still shedding out but it may have slowed it down some.</li>
    <li> Dries out your hair,  leaves itchy scalp.  Have no idea how anyone could give this a good review.  It may work.. but cost od irritated dry lifeless hair is not worth it to find out.  big waist of money.  If it sold for $2 dollars it would still be a big waist of money</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair silky smooth.  My scalp is clean and hydrated. It has a great smell too.  I use twice per day.</li>
    <li> My hair continues to fall out, genetics and all that. But it looks fuller and seems to have slowed the loss-process. :) I really like this shampoo. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and I see a difference in my hair my hair is colored processed and natural curly so it is frizzy since using this shampoo I see that my hair looks smoother and not as frizzy so I will continue to use this product .</li>
    <li> Great product. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far I have been using this shampoo for a little over a month and it actually seems to be helping my hair where its thinning out in the back to grow in thicker. I have yet to experience anything that makes my hair feel funny from it either it just feels like normal shampoo. It even works so well when I went to see my hair stylist she asked me what was finally working to help my hair grow in my bald spot because she knows I have tried everything. I think with a few more months of use it will be almost back to a full head of hair!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very gentle on your hair.  I shampoo every other day, so I wanted a shampoo that would not dry out my hair and this is it!  My hair has a lot of body after drying it too, which is important to me since my hair is thinning.  I have only used this product for about a month so I am hoping that it will help prevent hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product just because of the gentleness and body it gives my hair.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend this shampoo. My hair grew so  long within less than 2 months. Keeps my hair healthy, not dry!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with hair loss for months now and tried several products until I came across the Pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention organic shampoo. I&#x27;ve used several different types of hair loss products in the past but nothing is compared to this. I am amazed how quickly the treatment takes effect. After applying this shampoo for several weeks, less and less hair fell and my hair felt very vitalized. It&#x27;s been 3 months that I&#x27;ve used this product as my primary shampoo and its guarantee to work for those who have hair loss problems. I would recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy. I used to get Head and Shoulders and just not worry about shampoo. I tried this because I thought my hair was thinning (It&#x27;s not .. my hairline just changed as I grew into my 30s), but this stuff is amazing. Whenever I get my haircut, the barber almost always comments about how thick my hair is.</li>
    <li> The shampoo worked well at first, but then I noticed I had more dandruff than usual. Should use in combination with another shampoo, probably, alternating between uses.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, my hair looks and feels healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the thickness/balding factor yet though</li>
    <li> Yes, I have seen the power of this product and I believe this could solve Lebron James hairline problem. In a nutshell I am not personally losing hair but I have a friend that is and decided to grab this for him as sort of a gag gift for his birthday and to see if this actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started about two months ago and the first few weeks we did not see much difference, I guess his scalp had to get use to the product but within a month of using the product we slowly saw things changing in a good way! His hair that was falling out stopped and in some places he actually gained hair back. He did mention that a few times using the product that he had to rinse more than once because it left this greasy stain in his hair but he&#x27;s pretty satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess my gag gift actually worked better then I planned.</li>
    <li> Apparently this one is all it is cracked up to be, the wife is happy with it so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> My father has been trying similar products for a good few years now and has found Pura d&#x27;or to be the answer! He is at that age where he is very concerned with hair loss and this product seems to have slowed nature down! In addition, one bottle seems to last forever!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products, to stop my hair from thinning as I get older, and this one seems to be working.  I have noticed less hair in the shower drain and on my brush!!!  Hair appears to be fuller, and not as sparse :)  I will definitely continue using this shampoo, thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Smells o.k. makes my hair kind of dry not noticed a growth in length of my hair</li>
    <li> Hi guys, I guess this type of shampoo us not for everybody, I purchased this like 2 week ago, I&#x27;ve been using it since then, but the results for me are not very good, I noticed that since I&#x27;ve used it, I lost so much hair than before and also if I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, my hair gets a bad smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and plan to use for at least 6 months before making a final product conclusion.  I also combine this with Procerin, a herbal supplement tablet.  The shampoo lathers great and it doesn&#x27;t take much to wash my hair. My hair feels clean after washed. The fragrance is and I don&#x27;t have dandruff issues as a result of using.  I am using this shampoo in hope to reduce any future hair loss.  I am not expecting regrowth, but if it happens that would definitely be a bonus.  This I can tell you, I have not noticed any hair loss so far.  Will review again in the upcoming months.</li>
    <li> I bought Pura d&#x27;or hair loss shampoo at a salon and I&#x27;ve got to say that this is one of the best hair loss shampoos out there. I started using it when i noticed my receding hairline. After a few uses i started noticing amazing results. The shampoo smells great unlike others i have used in the past. Overall, i would use this again and recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair starting to look thinner. I ignored it, until my girlfriend noticed it too. That made me decide it was better to deal with it rather than wait and wish I had done something sooner. I didn&#x27;t care about getting anything back, I just wanted to stop it from getting any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lots of research into what really works for hair loss and ways to keep your head healthy I ran across this. I had a mild case of thinning hair and figured using a healthier shampoo that actually addressed DHT would be enough to slow it down. It was. But not only did the thinning stop, new growth started to show up after the first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m months into using it every day and my hair is better than ever. It&#x27;s as thicker than ever and feels better too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lasts a long time, it&#x27;s thick, lathers great, and smells very good too. It&#x27;s a natural woodsy scent, so no worries about smelling like your girlfriends fruity shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this even if I wasn&#x27;t trying to address thinning hair, it&#x27;s simply a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> I got all my information about this product from reading all the reviews, and I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals most shampoos have that are harmful to your hair,  but still too early to tell if I&#x27;m going to like it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good product, I like it so much. It&#x27;s organic and do not have the extra chemical added.  It prevents premature hair loss and increase the volume.</li>
    <li> very disappointed, have been using it for 6 months and haven&#x27;t seen any results whatsoever, just makes hair look greasy</li>
    <li> The shampoo helped my to stop the hair loss after 2 weeks. I use it with every morning before I go to work and it helps my hair to stay clean and also I can tell it works because my hair is filling in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> got this as a present from my mom (along with other beauty products) and I can&#x27;t say how much I love this stuff! Ive been searching for quality organic shampoo for a while, one that doesn&#x27;t smell weird or leaving me feeling like my hair didn&#x27;t really get cleaned and this is the one! It gives my hair a nice natural shine, it smells good, and its ORGANIC!!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about six weeks and it has indeed done what it claims to do. I have NOT experienced any dandruff or hair loss after using this product. However, I agree, with another reviewer who pointed out that this shampoo, like any other product, will not work for literally ALL people. For my chemical makeup, this shampoo is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main attraction for me is that this product is certified organic by the USDA and contains no toxins or harsh chemicals. Also, the price is quite competitive despite the fact it&#x27;s organic. For example, the last brand I was using was Kerastase. This product matches the price of Kerastase and gives you nearly twice as much shampoo for your money. This combined with the fact that it&#x27;s organic makes this product the best I&#x27;ve found so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The bottle has a pump on the top, and it dispenses the right amount for me at about 3/4 of the way down (I&#x27;m a white male with medium-length hair). The one thing I saw people complaining about in some of the other reviews is the smell of the shampoo. This is purely a matter of personal taste, so you may or may not like it. It has more of an earthy smell than most shampoos, which I personally enjoy. Again, not everybody is going to like the smell. It&#x27;s just my preference, as I don&#x27;t appreciate how strong-smelling and fruity some other shampoos are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, this product supports my hair growth and prevents hair loss, it&#x27;s organic, I like the smell, and I get more bang for my buck than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> For the past few weeks, I have tried this product and I can say without a doubt that&lt;br /&gt;the quality of my hair has improved by leap &amp; bounds. This shampoo does wonders for&lt;br /&gt;my hair type, and I&#x27;m glad I gave this a shot before I chose seomthing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it&#x27;s certified organic so it does appeal to me as I don&#x27;t like having any&lt;br /&gt;artificial ingredients in the products that I use for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other people may complain of the smell, but they may be used to over-powering fruity&lt;br /&gt;shampoos that you detect a mile away. I like the earthy, natural smell as it gives me a more organic feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this helps me prevent hair loss along with giving me better looking hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo for my wife actually. I was tired of seeing all the hair in the sink and on the floor after she was done fixing her hair. I used to joke about the spider webs she left behind when she was done. At first she didn&#x27;t want to start using this shampoo but after a few days I finally convinced her to at least try it for a week or two. She did and I know its really too soon but, well after the 3rd day I noticed that there wasn&#x27;t any hairs in the sink. None the next day or the day after that too. I had to ask her if she had cleaned up the bathroom in the last few days and she said she hadn&#x27;t. As I said, I know its early but I&#x27;ve become a believer that this stuff works! I&#x27;m using it now too. Love the way it lathers up and feels. Wish I would have found out about this shampoo 20 years ago.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It has really helped my hair and scalp. I would recommend this shampoo for everyone with any allergy problems!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to me and so far I am very pleased with the results. It has been one week since I started using the shampoo and I can already notice a fuller head of hair. Yea it&#x27;s a little expensive, but worth every penny in my opinion!</li>
    <li> In the first month of using this product, I was a bit skeptical especially given all of the reviews (most likely due to the free bottle of shampoo offer upon receipt of the bottle), but the shampoo seems to be doing its job of limiting hair loss. Compared to other shampoos I have used in the past (head and shoulders, etc...) this one seems to be doing a better job of keeping hair on my head. I notice far fewer hairs falling out during normal shower periods (morning and evening) after using this product so at the very least, this is a worthy and tangible benefit of this product. Time will tell if it continues to do all it claims.</li>
    <li> i am happy with this product</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a couple of months and has given me more confidence in my hair.</li>
    <li> This product has a very good sell and also it feels good on the hair. I am just not sure if it really helps on hair loss.</li>
    <li> I ordered the conditioner and the shampoo together.  I&#x27;ve only been using this product for four weeks and could see subtle results after the first four to seven days.  I&#x27;m loosing less hair now and I have more volume!  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the long term results as I continue using these two products.</li>
    <li> CANNOT OPEN THE DISPENSER, THE SHAMPOO BOTTLE WAS ALREADY LEAKED WHEN I OPEN THE WRAPPING PLASTIC AND IT WAS REALLY NASTY.</li>
    <li> after 6 months I have not seen much change in my hair, not can say anything bad, but there are cheaper and suitable quality products.</li>
    <li> I actually dont know if it worked or not..never noticed any change. The shampoo goes gooey after a few months...making it unusable.</li>
    <li> I had a really tough February 2015. Bad enough that once May hit, my hair started falling out like crazy in the shower. I tried giving myself a few weeks to see if it stop on its own, but it really hadn&#x27;t. So I figured I would take things into my own hands.  As well as Pura d&#x27;or, I&#x27;m using a Hair and Nail supplement, but after about 5 washes in 2 weeks, I can see a significant different. I&#x27;m going to credit the shampoo as well as the supplements.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty certain that I got a defective pump, it doesn&#x27;t go back up on its own. That has nothing to do with how well the shampoo works, so I&#x27;m not going to complain about that as some people would. In my photo, they were both taken after washing and conditioning my hair.  Top was taken May 24th and the bottom was taken today, June 6th. My hair is waist long though, so it probably looks worse than it is, but there is still a good change.</li>
    <li> only used it for a short time but my barber said it seems to be working a bit</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo very much . After using it, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel so dry and even it doesn&#x27;t come off like before . Great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product - noticed hair growth about 3 weeks after use. Not sure you need the companion conditioner, but this product is a must have. So far the regrow hair is thin and short but my barber told me that it may take a year to gain significant growth. Will see and keep you posted.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27; or shampoo cleans my hair like no store purchased shampoo ever has in a very long time. The thickness of the shampoo is perfect, I only use two squirts from the container. It does not leave my hair dry after each use and leaves my hair softer and very manageable. I have noticed since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo that less of my hair is coming out of my head while combing or brushing. I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and I had to let time pass to give it time to work for me or fail, it has worked and I will continue to use it. No more store purchased hair shampoo for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this shampoo for my brother and he loves it,this is the third bottle,</li>
    <li> seems to be working very well - i can tell my hair grows faster and im not quite sure about growing back in areas that are already gone, but hopefully won&#x27;t loose anymore &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I was using in last 4 to 5 month n it&#x27;s really work for me that&#x27;s why I buy again on eBay this time it&#x27;s really good for hair loss</li>
    <li> used it for over 3 month3. didn&#x27;t work at all. what&#x27;s even worse was my hair became more and more smelly everyday that I myself couldn&#x27;t even stand it! worst hair shampoo ever!! wish I never bought and used it!</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo since Aveda&#x27;s Sap Moss. This stuff is great with the conditioner and smells earthy and fresh. Love it!</li>
    <li> My husband has been losing his hair for years.  I read about pura d&#x27;or and brought some for him.  Not only did it promote new hair growth it lasts a long time.  A little bit produces great lather.  His hair shines and there is more of it.  I liked the results so much that now we both use the pura d&#x27;or shampo.</li>
    <li> Expensive bottle of stuff that is basically useless.  Pretty name for this product.  Maybe some people had success, not us.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used for that winter dry scalp ! it is not expensive and really helps out .</li>
    <li> Good deliver time.I will be starting chemo pills soon so I got this to hopefully strengthen my hair,plus its sulfate free which I am allergic to all sulpha products.</li>
    <li> I did use this product, it really stops hair loss. It improves the roots of the hair and gives good colour to the hair.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good organic shampoo that would be gentle, yet effective, and I was trying one shampoo after another.  My hair isn&#x27;t as thick as it used to be so a friend of mine told me about Pura d/or. The first time I used it I was so happy with the fact that the amount of hairs in the sink had lessened. I also love the way it leaves my hair smelling. My hair looks and feels the way it did when I was a teenager. I am totally in love with this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Okay first of all I understand that you guys might think that a lot of people post fake reviews and what not. Obviously you don&#x27;t know who the person is who is posting this but just listen to me for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;I have been suffering from hair loss since I was 17 years old and now I am 19. I was always stressed because all my other friends would notice my thinning hair and it was embarrassing. Im a male with short hair so they could clearly tell what was wrong. I went to a Bosley doctor and they prescribed me finasteride and also told me to use another product that I find good or helpful for my hair such as this one. So one day I was scrolling through some products and found this one. I do not regret one bit of purchasing this product. I started to use the product for a few weeks and I felt like giving up because I didn&#x27;t see any results. But after about two months I noticed that my hair has REALLY IMPROVED. Like my hair looked much fuller then before and some bald spots that I had were gone. To be honest I know you guys are scared to try new products but you have to take my word for it this is amazing. My hair has stopped shredding and I can see more hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am honestly going to use this product for the rest of my life. Hopefully in a year or so my hair will be much better then before.</li>
    <li> I really like the way my hair feels after shampooing.  It does not feel limp anymore, and it seems to feel thicker and cover my sparse areas of my scalp.  I previously purchased two bottles of Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and noticed less hair in the strainer.  Then I got stupid and bought Wen products, which smell great and gave me more body--but I had a greatly increased hair loss after a month.  I bought another two bottles of Pura d&#x27;or and my hair is looking better again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to others, but I gave it 4 stars because I feel that you have to keep using it for good results, and it is a little pricey (but much less than the other product I mentioned. . .).</li>
    <li> This product is little bit expensive but after first few uses; I did notice that it helped in avoiding hair fall to an extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one more thing is that it has also helped me with dandruff issues. I used some other products for dandruff before but this has helped me deal dandruff little better.</li>
    <li> I loved the ingredients of the shampoo, the fragrance and the lather it does. It works well along with other methods to prevent hair loss, but don&#x27;t expect this shampoo be the only remedy you need. Find the reason of hair loss and use the shampoo to support your hair.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 20s and have had thinning hair for several years. I am tried several products, including Nioxin. Nioxin is expensive, it drives your hair out, and it has a strong chemical smell. Pura d&#x27;or is the only product I have found to work. It contains all natural ingredients, it smells nice, and it adds nourishment to your hair. After using the product for a couple of months, even my hair dresser noticed the thickness in my hair and new hair growth. I would highly recommend using natural and organic products for hair loss. Stay away from the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoos that I have ever had. It really works well, I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality that this product has! Will definitely continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Finally I found a shampoo product that actually works for my dry, itchy scalp.  My scalp now doesn&#x27;t itch.  It also has pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> i start using the product the next day it arrived and the same day I used the pura d&#x27; or hair shampoo and felt a difference. not only it has  a magnificent smell, but the texture and way it feels and washes your scalp its fantastic. I wont write much about the product. you have to try it. it worth the money and time. I wish i could find this at my local store, so from now on I will make sure to reorder way in advance so i&#x27;m never out of stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the production in consistent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,</li>
    <li> Good rich product that means you don&#x27;t need much per wash to get plenty of lather. Don&#x27;t know whether it actually prompts regrowth but it does seem to arrest hair loss and stabilizes, which is certainly a step in the right direction.</li>
    <li> Purchased recently and have used only a few times so far. No chemical smells. Product is a bit sticky. Hoping that it will live up to its name and bold claims.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with a organic hair product but I was pleasantly surprised by the results. All the scientific formula hair products did very little compared.</li>
    <li> I am by nature a skeptic of products that promise things like Hair Loss Prevention, but the copious amounts of hair on the floor told me I needed to finding something and after much research I came across Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo and Conditioner. After 2, going on 3 months of using this product I am a true believer and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for something that REALLY works!! It has cut the amount of hair on the floor in half!</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles of Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo originally from Groupon after I had significant hair loss due to hormone issues (potentially from heat treating as well?).  I didn&#x27;t want to buy a shampoo with a bunch of synthetic/artificial ingredients so this was the perfect option.  It took a few months, but I had a tiny line of new hair grown that was distinct.  After about a year+ of use much of where my hair had fallen out has new growth and people regularly comment on how health my hair looks.  I use this in combination with Acure conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle lasts a long time, so even though it is priced higher it is very concentrated, it took me about 16 months to go through 2 bottles.  The scent is a combo of tea tree and woodsy, but not too strong.  As a woman, experiencing hair loss was extremely distressing so I can&#x27;t explain the relief of seeing new hair growth.  Overall I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results of this shampoo since my balding spots are visibly reduced!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo based on the positive reviews. I needed a shampoo that could help reducing falling hair problem. I could notice big difference the very first time i used. It did help in preventing hair loss. I am liking it and will continue using it. It feeling very gentle on hair and scalp and leaves hair manageable.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have been using this for a little over one week.  In one spot where there was balding there is definitely hair growing.  I like it and it seems to work.  It smells a little medicated but nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks. I don&#x27;t feel anything up to now.</li>
    <li> Makes hair silky smooth and has a very natural smell to it. Smells so pure and unprocessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly recommend Purador!</li>
    <li> This stuff seemed to coat the hair and make it feel thicker. It did nothing to grow hair. It dried my hair out so badly I had to have my hair cut super short to take the dead hair off.&lt;br /&gt;To add insult to injury I don&#x27;t see a contact the seller choice.</li>
    <li> I believe it helps with preventing hair loss. Really works!</li>
    <li> Great product! I started to use minoxidil which caused more hairloss after months using. This product helped my hair recover from minoxidil disaster and now it is better than before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for 1 year, take biotin supplements and multivits w/iron.  My hair looks healthy and feels luxurious.  If the ends get a bit dry due to chlorine from the pool, I use a bit of this brand&#x27;s argan oil.  Also, I rub a bit of the argan oil on my hands, then gently massage my scalp.  The two products work great together.  I just purchased 2 more bottles and am hooked.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo.  It smells great and makes my hair feel silky smooth.  I&#x27;m not worried about hair loss as much as I have scalp issues-itchy eczema borderline psoriasis.  This helps so much more than tar shampoos that are nasty to use and smell awful.  Only four stars because of the price...but worth it if you can afford it!</li>
    <li> Fast and friendly service.  I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week.  So far so good, will more after I use it for a few more weeks.  Thanks,  Joanna Bruns</li>
    <li> This would be my 2 bottle of purador argon oil premium organic shampoo. I have thin hair and a bad receding hair line. Is this a cure all that has grown my hair back.. No but it seems to help what I have and I believe it has slowed my hair loss some. My hair does look stronger and healthier since I&#x27;ve started using this product</li>
    <li> I love the product and the fact that you do not use Sodium Laurel Sulfate makes me feel safe. Thank you</li>
    <li> Made my hair very dry frizzy &amp; tangled, all that can be handled with other hair products but the sad thing is that this shampoo made my hair loss way much worse! It&#x27;s easily falling in huge amount sometimes even without touching it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for one week and have definitely noticed less hair falling out. Will continue to use to see if it stops completely.</li>
    <li> Like many of you who may be reading this I was on the hunt for a preventive measure to my thinning hair. I tried many over the counter (local) &amp;#34;solutions&amp;#34; (many 4-5x the cost of Purad&#x27;or) none of them worked. In fact a few products caused me to shed (there for loosing even more hair!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the hunt for  a solution, without all the BS. Go with Purador!&lt;br /&gt;I read on forums for weeks about peoples realistic experience with this product, and i had to see for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works.&lt;br /&gt;Period.&lt;br /&gt;I see mild results within 2 weeks of use. and honestly that&#x27;s all i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Purad&#x27;or</li>
    <li> It really can stop the hair loss. Good product.</li>
    <li> Let me start off my saying I have tried plenty of shampoos for hair loss. Although I have come to the conclusion that a shampoo alone will not do much, if anything for regrowing hair, in terms of prevention a good shampoo can go a long way. I have a dry scalp, and this is the only shampoo I use that is beneficial for my hair and does not make it itch after I shower or contribute to flakiness. It can help significantly if you occasionally get scalp acne. After trying all the non-sense out there, this is the best out there for me. It helps keep my hair thick and full without worrying about any crazy harsh ingredients. It may seem expensive but buying the essentials oils and various other ingredients in this shampoo is pretty expensive as well. With the quantity and quality your getting a pretty good deal. It is not miracle grow for hair, no shampoo is, but its one darn good cleanser for your scalp (that&#x27;s what a shampoo is after all right). Like a good facial cleanser, this too will improve the health of the scalp contributing to hair loss prevention. It holds true to its purpose.</li>
    <li> So far the product is great! I have used it now for close to three weeks. I have medium length hair and I use one pump which gets a lot of soap lather for me to apply. I followed the directions and leave it on for a few minutes then rinse it off. I think the scent is neutral and not gross at all. It recommended daily use, so although I used to wash my hair every other day, I have used it every day for three weeks. My hair is not drying out at all as I feared (I even live in a dry area) but rather is doing quite well. I am pleased thus far with this product. I think time will tell if it will help with the hair loss prevention however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a month now and today my hair dresser asked what I had been doing different because I had tons of new hair growth! I recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Well, so far so good. I wash my hair daily and it&#x27;s not getting dried out as with other shampoos. I don&#x27;t see as much hair in the shower drain either -- which is very important! I hope this continues!</li>
    <li> Really gets your hair clean. Whether it works or not remains to be seen, but so far I love it.</li>
    <li> Since the first shampoo, I was surprised by the unpleasant smell.  Amid all it&#x27;s claims, it leaves my hair feeling dry and looking dull.  I haven&#x27;t noticed yet whether it prevents hair loss; but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason.  I&#x27;ve purchased other argan oil products from other companies in the past because of the lovely fragrance and moisture that I need for processed hair.  I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been holding back for over a month to see the actual effect of using Pura d&#x27;or before writing this review. For the first couple weeks after using this product, there was no significant change of my hair loss. Starting from late third week, I started seeing less hair fell out. I was hoping this product will stop the hair loss and strengthen my hair after using it daily over a month. It only slow down the pace of my hair loss. One positive change is this product gives my hair a shiny look. For hair regrowth, I found it is better to use Pura d&#x27;or with hair regrowth treatment product.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different thickening/hair loss products including Bumble &amp; Bumble, Nioxin, prescriptions, vitamins, etc. This seems to do more than any of those and it&#x27;s really not that expensive if you don&#x27;t use too much... and considering how important your hair is to the way you look &amp; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the \\&quot;hair thickening\\&quot; shampoos/conditioners/products on the market use wheat protein. This makes no sense to me: why would you put wheat ON your hair when gluten/wheat intolerance/celiac disease is one of the prominent causes of thinning hair and hair loss? It seems like with this they&#x27;ve combined all the ingredients that are supposed to be effective for hair loss into one shampoo and it makes sense that you would apply saw palmetto, etc topically rather than taking supplements (plus im lazy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the main reason I&#x27;m into this stuff is that my hair looks great. People keep commenting that there is a noticeable difference, including my hairdresser. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s making me grow new hair, but definitely seems to be keeping me from losing more and making the hair I have look fuller.</li>
    <li> I have recently completed my tertiary exam of my educational life. From my student life, I was used to take care of my hair with shampoo and soaps. But due to regular use of shampoo and soaps, I started to lose my hair. So, I was really disappointed because my future is ahead and I would require to face so many interviews for my career, but did not get any confidence because of the hair. But one day my older brother advised me about this product, I thought to use a hair loss prevention shampoo. But, I was not ready to use another product after wasteful trying of so much hair tonic products. However, when I used this product, I didn&#x27;t even believe that it gave me astonishing results. Really, some of my hair actually grows. I am very happy after using the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo. Not sure it can cure hair loss or prevent it, but it does clean and feel good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s and bald genes run in the family.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over 2 months, and my hairline started to recede substantially quicker.&lt;br /&gt;My balding had been quite slow compared to my brother and I felt lucky... until recently I tried out this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair started to thin much more quickly than usual over the last month. My hairline receded at least by 1/4 centimeter over a month and that&#x27;s quite substantial considering I already had a slightly more receded hairline than non-balding people.&lt;br /&gt;My hairs got so think I actually can see the skin of my hair when I lift my hair line up. This had never been a problem with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to look for the reason why my hair loss sped up so quickly, and I realized that I got this shampoo to try out how effective they are against balding and have been using this for over 2 months. I also started to take biotin pills, but as biotin is a nutrient for hair, I really doubt if it would cause the increased balding. Although there&#x27;s a chance that my balding is speeding up due to the genes and my age, for now I believe that the shampoo probably affected it substantially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed a sudden drop of sex drive. This also could have been affected by my age (although very not likely as I&#x27;m still in my mid 20&#x27;s), probably to the lowest level ever in my life. But I can&#x27;t say for sure that this shampoo is the cause. But I&#x27;m, for sure, switching to a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the shampoo is actually the cause of these symptoms, than buying this product would be one of the biggest mistakes I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> After couple weeks of using this product I definitely saw a difference. My hair began to regain growth and thickness. One downside of this is that you have to constantly use this shampoo. I stopped using it for a month and saw an instant difference. I will be using this product for days to come. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m simply amazed at how fast Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil Premium Organic Shampoo has made a difference with my hair! I&#x27;ve used all sorts of shampoos and hair treatments that only dried my hair, yet in only a couple of weeks of using Pura D&#x27;or, my hair looks a lot like it did in my engagement picture when I was 22!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decades of suffering with itchy scalp psoriasis have made it necessary for me to use an alcohol-based medicine to treat the itch, and a lifetime of applying color has caused my hair to become thin, dull, and kinky. Surprisingly, right now my hair is shinier, wavier, and has more depth. It&#x27;s more manageable. I wash it, comb it, spray it a little, and forget about it. My short, dark hair now waves beautifully and has a smoother texture and a sculpted look. No more wild frizz, even in the recent humidity! With summer coming, what a relief! I can&#x27;t imagine how much more attractive my hair will be after six months or a year of using a shampoo that appears to be soothing my scalp and nourishing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair looks good, I feel wonderful. Finally I&#x27;ve found a non-irritating shampoo as the answer to my prayers.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Whether it works, I&#x27;m not too sure, but from what it looks like, my hair has been shedding incredibly less.  The smell is not something that smells the best, but it sure cleans.  Can&#x27;t say if it will work for everybody as body chemistry depends on the person, but so far, it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
    <li> Have used for a while now. Has definatley worked for me. Worth a try if your hair is thinning. Excellent.</li>
    <li> My friends called me an old haggard just because the bald spots on my head! I was terribly losing my hair and quite disappointed about it. What is the solution for me? How can I solve my hair fall problem? How can I regain my natural dark hair? Well, I’ve got a perfect solution for the questions. It’s nothing but Pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo! I’ve been using it for around four months and it helped me stop my hair fall and grow new hair as well! Is it a magic? I think so!</li>
    <li> I am a hair dresser. Being a hairdresser, I know quite a few ways to maintain my hair. But I was passing through a huge problem when I observed my hair is shedding and I hardly found a way to stop it. I was really worried and ask my colleague what to do to stop such hair fall. My colleague suggested me to try organic hair loss prevention premium shampoo by Pura d’or. It just reversed my hair fall problem within twenty five days of using it. Beside hair fall protection it also helps my hair growth into the bald spots.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, makes my hair soft and full. It does grow new hairs but it feels like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or for a month and I see amazing results. I had intensive hair loss and I&#x27;ve tried so many products like shampoos, lotions and pills. Most of them are very expensive and they did not help me at all. Very few of them reduced the hair loss just a little bit and only for a while but it was not satisfactory. Now I wash my hair every day with Pura d&#x27;or and after a month my hair loss is reduced by 70-80%! I really recommend it to anyone suffering from hair loss. Before you try anything else, try this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I don&#x27;t use this myself but I buy this for mother, who LOVES it. She has even had me buy extra so she could take the extra down to her regular hair stylist. Now all the older ladies at my mom&#x27;s regular salon use this and swear by it.</li>
    <li> I suffer from Hypothyroidism, and with that see an increase in hair shed. I have gone from product to product, and think I just may have found a product that is working for me. First, I&#x27;d like to start with the smell and texture of this product. I love the fresh clean scent and the foaming characteristics of this product. I like the way my hair feels so clean after I use it. My  hair loss has become significantly less after about the third week into using it.I love that it is organic, so I feel good about what I&#x27;m putting on my hair. I realized that it was a little drying, so I use about three times a week and use a more conditioning shampoo in between. I would like to say that I do take a thyroid vitamin supplement, as well as evening primrose oil, which combined with the shampoo has helped me immensely. It is definitely worth giving it a try!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo several times now and I am pretty happy with it. It definetely feels different than any other shampoo I have used in the past. It leaves hair with a more clean and residue-free so it does have that organic feel. I did not give it five stars only because I don&#x27;t think I have noticed the &#x27;hair loss preventation&#x27; element yet. I like how the shampoo feels and cleans the hair but I am not noticing less of a hair loss then before... If nothing else, this shampoo does make it a bit more difficult to brush the hair if not used in conjunction with a conditioner. I will keep using it to see if the hair loss component will become evident with time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 22yo asian female, with straight hair. I&#x27;ve noticed a significant increase in hairfall recently, prolly because of the colder season now. Anyways I&#x27;ve always been worried about losing hair, and purchased this due to all the good reviews. Not too sure if most of them are shills, or how its gonna work out (just received it a couple of days ago). For now it cleans hair really well, and smells kinda herby. The texture is sort of a paste too rather than the usual liquid form most shampoos have. I do notice it adds a bit of volume though, which helps with looking like you&#x27;ve got more hair. Will update after using, fingers crossed it helps with hair growth!    Edit:  After two weeks of use, significantly less hairfall (about halved) and healthier looking hair with less frizz. At the same time it looks more voluminous, which is great, cause for girls, you mostly get either volume but frizz, or sleek but flat. (: haven&#x27;t noticed hair growth as yet, perhaps cause I can&#x27;t tell with the long hair, and its been only 2 weeks. More to come!    Edit:   It&#x27;s now been over two months. My hairfall didn&#x27;t continue decreasing, but plateaued to about less than half my usual hairfall. I think there&#x27;s hair growth - when I tie my hair up, lots of baby hair stick out from all over like I&#x27;ve just touched a static ball. I&#x27;d say this shampoo is worth the try. My second bottle&#x27;s on the way!</li>
    <li> So far so good. We combine this and taking the Biotin tablets.. and after about 3 weeks, we really see new hair growth!!! Wohoo!! Now we just ordered Castrol Oil to give it more power! Yeah!</li>
    <li> Have used product now for five weeks every other day per product instructions (leave on for 2 minutes).Good news is there does seem to be less hair loss but it coincides with that time of year when that usually occurs anyway.Was hopeing product may provide a little &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; but it does not.I am not getting the itchyness experienced with other shampoos after extended use,but have not reached extended use qualifying time yet.Still get to &amp;#34;oily appearance&amp;#34; by end of next day.Hair feels generally softer,less vibrant,less managable and more matted as use continues,would like a little more &amp;#34;fullness&amp;#34; as in extra-body shampoos but then that would be returning to store bought shampoos and probably the itchyness too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars because I found it to make my hair even more oily then it is naturally. But it may have helped my hair grow a bit faster. I&#x27;m not certain though.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo. Leaves hair clean, no residue.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for over a year just rec&#x27;d my second bottle. I really love this shampoo. Really lathers up well and makes my hair feel thicker. I have experimented not using it for a week and my hair was not as full as when using this shampoo. The bottle lasted a year I wash my hair every other day. Highly recommend for thinning fine hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I have been using it for about one week so far.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been enough time to determine if it prevents hair loss, but it leaves my hair silky soft and frizz free.  To me, it has a somewhat medicinal smell;  not the most fragrant but not repulsive either.  It has a rich lather which feels great on my scalp.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am not leaving this review just to receive the free gift. I do believe that (after two weeks of use) this product does have some positive effect in the prevention of further hair loss. I would hopefully give it 5 stars after a years use..</li>
    <li> I began to notice some thinning on the top of my head and decided to try this shampoo based on some of the reviews that I read.  I have been using the shampoo for about five months and there is some new hair growth and no additional thinning.  My hair also seems to have more body and is soft without use of a conditioner. While it may seem a bit pricier than normal shampoos, one bottle lasts awhile.  After five months, I am still on my first bottle.</li>
    <li> bought for my father and it works well!</li>
    <li> After reading some positive feedback from more then thousand users I decided to give this product a try. So far so good after 2 weeks using it. Im a male losing hair since 18 due to genetic baldness. I had hair transplant and try to keep my natural hair healthy and from falliung out often. But I also want to save my hairs that are naturally growing. And at this moment im a bit satisfied with this product. I will see results in coming days if it really does what it tells. Nothing to lose try using it.</li>
    <li> So far, so good... Seems to cleanse gently, and also actually does seem to build body.  I like it!</li>
    <li> My dad passed this on to me, (too late for him!) and boy does it work well! I&#x27;m going to have to stock up here quickly!</li>
    <li> Usually organic based shampoos are very expensive and a price of $25.00 is a steal. This is a great shampoo because it is free of chemicals which usually damage the hair follicles and do not promote hair regrowth or hair growth. Whenever I put this shampoo on, I love how it feels in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like other shampoos I have used in the past. Also a good thing about this hair shampoo is that whenever I rinse the shampoo out of my hair, it doesn&#x27;t tangle up my hair like other shampoos have done in the past. Overall, my reactions to this shampoo is that it was generally positive reviews and will recommend this to my friends and family that are losing their hair</li>
    <li> this is amazing , i just i used it for the first time and i can feel the difference , argan moroccan oil is the best .</li>
    <li> Since the birth of my kids, my hair has thinned out considerably and I have tried many shampoos but nothing compares to this. I love the fact that this shampoo is paraben free, organic, and made in the U.S.A.  This is my second bottle and I will definitely be coming back for more.</li>
    <li> Alright I would just like to make it clear that this product will not REGROW your hair but it does aid in helping reduce the amount of hair you loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for my fiancee&#x27;s hair because for quite some time she has been loosing more hair every day. I read the reviews on this product so I went out and bought it in hopes of helping my fiancee because everything else we have used hasn&#x27;t helped per say. Now, after using this product it has legitimately reduced some of her hair loss. It had left her hair feeling soft and more manageable unlike the others that had left it dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have to continue the use of this product to have continued results from it. So even though it&#x27;s a little more than most, this organic shampoo is very helpful in reducing the loss of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Made hair loss way worse. Frighteningly worse. Hopefully I can return.</li>
    <li> Due to popularity I thought it would be a safe bet to give this a try. I did read several comments regarding the possibility that many of these were fake reviews, and I truly would believe it now. The shampoo did nothing but make my hair more flimsy, and potentially fall out even more. Try it at your own risk  - risk of increased hair loss and a substantial amount of money wasted.</li>
    <li> No new growth, but no hair loss either.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo based on its reviews. I have ben using it for a month and don&#x27;t see any difference. My hair fall hasn&#x27;t got any better, it hasn&#x27;t got worse either. Also what I don&#x27;t like about this is that it leaves my hair quite dry and frizzy. I use conditioner and then hair spray but still my hair doesn&#x27;t feel very smooth silky.</li>
    <li> On the 1st use I noticed there&#x27;s no hair in the drain. That&#x27;s the good sign. seems to be working very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo when it was on sale a couple of years ago and ended up loving it.  I always try to go with organic options and this also is supposed to help with my thinning hair (which is really not that big a deal to me), I also enjoy the smell of the different botanicals in the morning, helps me wake up.  Overall very satisfied...</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing, it works! After a month of use I can say it definitely slowed down my hair loss, my hair is more full, shiny and healthy looking! I am so happy with my purchase, it&#x27;s worth every penny. I just ordered another bottle.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does everything that it advertises to do. I have been using this product for a few days and I feel my hair smoother and stronger. I expect it will prevent or reduce my hair loss because of its organic ingredients. I will continue to use this product and would recommend it to friends!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a year now. I will say that i like the way it makes my hair feels and it smells great. As far as its hair growth claims, I&#x27;m not sure i have really seen a whole lot of growth. I feel like i have not seen as much shedding so maybe it is helping..</li>
    <li> I have had problems with hair falling lately, I saw this product on Groupon and bought it, I am happy with the results so far. I&#x27;ve seen improvements after a few times using the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomend this product .</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but this product does deserve it! I have been using this shampoo for over 1 year and will not use anything else! I have very fine thin hair, and it&#x27;s not a miracle product that will give you &amp;#34;movie star&amp;#34; hair, but it has improved my hair! I have noticed decreased hair loss, and my hair definitely feels a lot thicker than it used. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not bad either. If something smells awful no matter how great of a product, I will refuse to use it to give you an idea of my smell tolerance. I would say the smell is more on the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; side than the &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34; side if that helps any. I do wash my hair everyday and I don&#x27;t see any negative affects of daily washing. I don&#x27;t have any dandruff from this product, and my hair actually feels softer as well. It is a bit pricy, but it&#x27;s worth it!! I have hair that&#x27;s about 3 inches below my shoulders and I use about a pump to two pumps per wash and it lasts over 3-4 months! I think I have covered everything and hope this helps someone out there! Products work differently for everyone, I am grateful this works for me! Stop reading reviews and try it already!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo to help with PCOS-related hair loss. I&#x27;ve used it three times so far and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the hair loss yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful I will see good results after a few more shampoos. I really like that it moisturizes the hair very well and makes it feel very soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for the past year, and I decided to try something new. I just purchased this shampoo and I love it. The texture of the shampoo does take some getting used to, and I wish it was more fragrant, but it definitely does its job because my hair is definitely fuller looking, even after the first use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband after watching his hair line quickly recede for the last few years. He would not use anything chemical. I found this on a search for organic hair loss treatment. I just ordered his second bottle after 3 months. I am happy to report that not only did he stop losing his hair but, it started growing in thicker! He went from a haircut every 4 weeks to every 2 weeks. The cost is amazing for how amazing this product is. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stopped believing in hair growth solutions; it&#x27;s more about prevention and gentle shampoos are in general better on your hair. I cant say that there are proven results but the shampoo does add a little bounce to the hair. The scent isnt all that great, but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
    <li> I thought I could do without this, and try another premium shampoo. I&#x27;d been using this for about a year and a half. I don&#x27;t know if it reduced hair loss, but I believe I see less in the drain, so .... But it definitely contributed to healthier hair, which meant going two years without needing a trim (and even then, it was about shaping rather than taking off split ends). Still, I didn&#x27;t realize how much of this was about my shampoo &#x27;til I tried to switch. I lasted a week and then ordered another bottle. Frizzy, dry, and my curls were a mess. I&#x27;m going to stick with this. I can wash as often as I want without dyeing my hair out, and it takes so little that the bottle lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several months and love it. Makes your hair fuller and smells great. The anti-hair loss, DHT blocking is a plus but I can&#x27;t say I have seen this happen instantly, I think it&#x27;s subtle and takes time. If it helps me keep a full head of hair for a bit longer I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I must be one of the few that this did nothing for. In fact, I feel like I&#x27;ve lost more hair since beginning use. Maybe it&#x27;s because it leaves my hair in knots after using it and I have to rip them out with a comb (despite trying not to). I use the conditioner, as well, and still feel as through I went to bed with gum in my hair after I use this. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months, because I really wanted this to work, but it just doesn&#x27;t. My drain is always full of my hair and my hair is at its thinnest. I won&#x27;t be using this line anymore.</li>
    <li> I accepted my hair loss about 5 years ago and started putting a razor to my scalp. For no other reason than to test the claims of some products I started a regimen of Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Shampoo, Toji hair nutrition pills, and Minoxidil about a year ago. I had tried similar products over the year but never stuck with them. The products always say best results seen in 3 months, or 6 months, etc. I always took this as marketing hype to gain customer loyalty for at least 6 months. Regardless, I was never good at creating the habit of using products as directed for that extended a period of time; this time was different. I stuck with everything and about a month in I noticed I had less hair on my hands when styling and my hair looked fuller/more volume, another month later I noticed I had some baby hairs around the front of my hairline that I never noticed before, and finally at about 3 months I noticed that I had hair regrowth. I can&#x27;t say if this was from the shampoo, pills, or minoxidil; but, I can say that I have ran out of Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and noticed more hair on my hands. I can honestly say that I won&#x27;t run out of this stuff again as I know it is at least a contributing factor to the re-growth or at least a contributing factor to maintaining what has re-grown from other products. I recommend this to anyone fighting hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that it does leave your scalp pretty dry. I started using a leave-in conditioner that I rub on my hair after the shower and that seems to curb any dandruff issues. As a bonus, I think the conditioner is an added bonus to hair health :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, these bottles last a long time. I have been using it for almost a year and just received my third bottle - at 2 showers/shampoos a day. It takes a portion of a single pump to create a very strong lather, so it is money well spent!</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life.</li>
    <li> I have bought 3 bottles and I can say I do like it better than the ovation shampoo for prevention of hair loss, especially when compared to ovation. I think to comparable products the price is decent. I honestly do feel like it does help prevent the hair loss, but as other users have mentioned it does make your scalp pretty dry. The only thing with any hair prevention product is you must continue to use it all the time, which gets pricey. I will continue to use this product until a better solution comes up.  I can’t give it five stars because of the drying of my scalp..</li>
    <li> like the product but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a difference</li>
    <li> (Wife) as a female, I can&#x27;t pull off a receeding hairline like men can.  This shampoo, and prescribed water pills (spirolactone) seems to help. I love that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot for it to lather.  Smells clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue either.</li>
    <li> Even though the bottle came with half the depresser cracked on top, ( but still works) I&#x27;m excited to try this out and put it to use. I heard great things and hope I can add a 5th star soon and make it a 5 star review. Recommended by a friend originally.</li>
    <li> I have mild signs of hair loss around my temples. In the last month or so using this product, I haven&#x27;t noticed much hair growth, but neither have I seen significantly more loss. So it could potentially be working. Time will tell. Hair is definitely softer, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is excellent. My hair feels soft and silky after washed. I used only few times and I love it so much I ordered another bottle for my daughter. I hope it stops my hair loss but is too earlier to tell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing a lot of hair loss and thinning for about 6 months. I can really notice it since I see more of my scalp and feel more of the breeze when it&#x27;s windy. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different shampoos trying to find the right one for me. So far I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a month. I&#x27;ve noticed so many less hairs falling out and new hairs starting to spring up. Around the same time I started using this shampoo, I also began taking a daily women&#x27;s vitamin supplement as well as a hair, skin and nails supplement containing biotin, collagen and silica. Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the shampoo or the vitamins or a combination. Going to continue this regimen and see how it goes. Wish me luck.</li>
    <li> Using this along with the conditioner. Not sure if Ive gotten any length in my hair but its certainly thickening up. I give this product 5 stars because for awhile my hair was falling out in clumps every time I took a shower because of all the medicine I used to take but once I started using this the hairs no longer fell out. Ive been using this product for a few wweks now so hopefully after sometime I&#x27;ll start to see some growth too! Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> We both love it.  Clean ingredients, hair feels fuller.  Smells like oregano when shampooing, but scent does not linger.</li>
    <li> My concern is the possible side effects of using DHT inhibitors even if they are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. Looking into products that claim this I stumbled on to Revivogen and the potential side effects were light headedness, disorientation and brain fog.</li>
    <li> The last few years i have noticed a bunch of hairs in my brush and on my pillow. In an effort to do what i can to help from going bald, i researched the best hair loss prevention shampoos. In my search, Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo kept appearing on the list as very highly ranked. The price was not outrageous so I figured i would try it. So far i am happy. I have been using it for a few weeks and i have no reason to think its not working. With hair, it takes some time to really see the effects, but i noticed right away how shiny it made my hair. The scent is not too strong or strange (as some things can be) and i enjoy it very much. Worth a try for anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great and it&#x27;s organic. I can already see a difference. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo so far. It has a beautiful smell and lathers up very nicely. Best of all, I feel safe using it on my hair and scalp with it&#x27;s safe, natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product now a little over two weeks and he noticed the difference right away. His hair feels and looks thicker and has noticed that he doesn&#x27;t lose as much hair when he dries it with a blow dryer. He would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair a few years ago. My mom has thin hair, so I assumed my hair loss was genetic. I went to a dermatologist and he said my scalp was healthy and the only thing to do was use Rogaine for Women. I found Rogain to be inconvenient to use for all over hair loss and it made my scalp itch. I was desperate to find a product that would slow down my hair loss. My pony tail was already half the size it used to be. I researched several products online, and decided to give this product a try due to good reviews. After several weeks, I noticed less hair falling out when I washed it. After the second bottle (about 6 months of use) my stylist told me I had LOTS of new hair growth coming in. Now, 10 months after starting this product, my hair is MUCH thicker with lots of volume. I will never stop using this shampoo!! I just bought my 4th bottle and have referred this product to several friends!</li>
    <li> This was my third bottle of this shampoo in as many years.  It&#x27;s a good quality product that doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair or weigh it down, and it does not contain the harsh chemicals found in typical drugstore shampoos.  It also does not seem to have as much buildup over time that makes hair flat and heavy.  It leaves my hair looking full and healthy with the right amount of body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating of four rather than five stars is because with each order I have seen inconsistencies in the product and bottle.  Each bottle has been slightly different in terms of how the shampoo feels and lathers (my first bottle was great but barely lathered at all and took a bit longer to rinse out; my second and third bottle lathered considerably more, prompting me to actually use less at a time, and rinsed a little more easily).  As for the bottle itself, each order has come with a different pump/dispenser, the first of which was the best, as it would dispense the perfect amount in one pump and could &#x27;lock&#x27; easily for travel with a quarter turn.  The pump on my second bottle dispensed too much and broke very quickly.  On my most recent bottle, the pump is changed again and can still dispense too much at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding claims of preventing hair loss, I feel this is bold and unrealistic.  No shampoo is capable of overpowering one&#x27;s genetics, so to buy this shampoo solely on the claim of hair loss prevention is a mistake.  That&#x27;s not possible.  What it will do for one&#x27;s hair is provide a gentle cleaning and act to fortify and nourish the hair one has - not damage it or dry it out - and this is why I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, each person&#x27;s hair is different, so your mileage may vary.  But I recommend trying it.  Don&#x27;t use too much at a time, and the bottle will last a long while.</li>
    <li> great product!!! will buy more</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for roughly 3 months.  It&#x27;s difficult to say whether or not it has prevented any further hair loss, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t made the problem worse.  This is an excellent shampoo in terms of lather, smell, etc.  Because of the reasonable price (in terms of hair loss shampoos), I&#x27;ll continue to use it for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> Great product, gives me peace of mind knowing that I&#x27;m getting my existing hair healthier while also preventing new hair loss. With no harsh chemicals or SLS, and a great smell what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> This is my second order of the same product.  I am not growing more hair, but I am not losing more either.  It is a good product.  My hair is clean and manageable after use.</li>
    <li> I think its a relatively natural shampoo and can keep my hair healthy.&lt;br /&gt;its not cheap, but I believe its worthy.</li>
    <li> Nice to have a shampoo with organic ingredients but without the product being labeled as a &amp;#34;drug&amp;#34; the product cannot claim to prevent hair loss. Without an active drug ingredient, it really shouldn&#x27;t be making this claim. Because the causes of hair loss are typically internal, a blend of herbs applied externally would have a very minimal effect. If the manufacturer can share what kind of studies they have done to back their claim, customers like me would be happier.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to help prevent balding, my hair hasn&#x27;t regrown but the hair that I maintained has become stronger. I would recommend this product, especially since its made of natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used! It gives me a full head of hair that shines! It works best with the conditioner. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Hair loss reduced,  not sure about growing new hair.</li>
    <li> Nice natural product with mild scent.  Creates good lather and gently cleans hair.  Been using the product for over a month and seems to be working - less hair in the drain and on brushes.</li>
    <li> Shampoo makes my hair feel very good and it cleans the scalp thoroughly. Fragrance is ok. I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO! My husband loves it too. I have very thin hair and seems I&#x27;ve been having some hair loss just due to age (45). I stopped highlighting my hair due to the damaging bleach although I still have a brown glaze applied every 8 weeks to help cover my gray. I also take my vitamins and try to eat healthy. All these things play a huge part in hair loss. My hair is already very thin and I&#x27;d like to keep as much as possible. I started using this shampoo along with the conditioner and my hair has never felt so good and very little hair loss in the shower! It also appeared thicker and lots of body! I can&#x27;t say enough about this shampoo! Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
    <li> my kids all love the smell and it works great</li>
    <li> Lost many hair after using it.I thought of trying it because of lots of positive comments out here and on other sites but on the very first day of use i have lost almost 200 of my so called left hair :(</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t even waste your time or money it is not worth it used for several months and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement</li>
    <li> I bought this mostly due to a deal that was being offered and thought what the H@ll.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the last month and I love it.  I used to get red blotches on my scalp and the tea tree oil has completely cured it.  it smells great and the fact that their is no harsh chemical in it makes me happy using it.  I recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for sometime now, I&#x27;m not sure about growing new hair but it does help in hair loss. When you use it just make sure to leave it on for about 2-3 minutes, then you will feel some itchiness, I&#x27;m guessing its the product working (or your scalp getting irritated just kidding). I&#x27;m also taking the biotin 10000 mcg and toji hair vitamins with it. Hopefully it helps.</li>
    <li> Hate to write a bad review but I tried different shampoos for hair loss, none of them worked for me. Unfortunately this one does not work for me as well. I guess shampoos are not strong enough to prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> Product works really well...smells nice, and not mediciney...lathers up well, unlike other hair loss prevention shampoos...will definitely buy again.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about a week now, my hair seems a little softer and it smells great.  Not sure how it works as far as hair loss, i will have to give it a little longer to see.  I am only 21 but my Dad had a bald spot on his head at only 19.  My hair is definitely thinner at the top, right where he lost his hair.  Price could be a little cheaper but if it really works is well worth it.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me, it leaves my hair soft and clean. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and I have noticed my hair stopped falling, I will continue using it in hopes that my hair gets stronger and fuller. I like the fact that it contains no SLS and harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been buying this shampoo for over 2 years and it has left my hair feeling stronger and looking better than ever before. I cannot say enough about this shampoo. It is a little pricey but definitely worth the cost. You only need a little bit so a bottle lasts for 2-3 months depending on the length of your hair. Mine lasts me about 3 months.</li>
    <li> Husband seems to like it. Hair seems full and not dried out like with previous shampoos. Too early to tell if it prevents further hair loss.</li>
    <li> good shampoo... does what is says prevents further hair loss and smells nice</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders on my husbands hair. His hair loss issue has improved immensely. This is a great product and i love that it is organic.</li>
    <li> The seller continues to play its shady tricks. I have to call it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pura D&#x27;or is definitely the shad-iest company. It uses its many accounts to post F.A.K.E for its own products. Most of reviews on Pura D&#x27;or products are F.A.K.E. It also posts F.A.K.E reviews on many high ranking products on Amazon to promote its S.C.A.M hair loss prevention shampoo and argan oil. It also uses its many accounts to post negative reviews for its competitors&#x27; products. Even more sham-eless-ly, it uses its many accounts to vote the negative reviews of its competitors&#x27; products \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; to make the negative reviews show on the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the reviews below were posted around the same time. They all directly or indirectly promote Pura D&#x27;or products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the following F.A.K.E reviews posted by Pura D&#x27;or. They are all the \\&quot;most helpful\\&quot; review (the first or second review) of each product. Of course, the \\&quot;most helpful\\&quot; was a result of fake votes from Pura D&#x27;or&#x27;s many accounts. Be sure to confirm the posting date, and see how Pura D&#x27;or uses its shad-y trick to promote its S.C.A.M products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the review has been deleted and reposted more than 10 times by Pura D&#x27;or to shed off any comments that have pointed out they are fake. All of them had direct link to its S.C.A.M hair loss shampoo and Argan oil. Now Pura D&#x27;or has removed some of the direct links to try to make them look less fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

    <li> I like the smell and how it makes my hair feel after I shower.  What&#x27;s nice is it has a really nice lather. I don&#x27;t run across a lot of shampoos that give me a great lather because I have super hard water where I live.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have tried thus far. Not only does my hair feel better, but it started to thicken up within 7 days! I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I felt compelled in hopes it would help somebody else too!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has made a difference in the amount of hair that I have lost with each shampoo. A 16 ounce bottle goes a long way. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Purchased Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo for a relative and they have requested another bottle because the results exceeded their expectations. Will order again...</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is reasonably priced and it helped to regrow my hair in less than 3 months. I love the way it makes my hair feel. It is thick and strong again. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works like an absolute charm. Being a person who has searched and searched for the right shampoo (THAT WORKS) for the right price....look no further. Here it is. Smells great, feels great, and once again it truly works. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have very thing light hair and a bit rough at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo stopped my hair loss problem but it left my hair very dry and extremely rough. Wen hair care actually worked better.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working or not.  I&#x27;ve combined the shampoo with another brand conditioner for hair loss and also Hair, Skin and Nail vitamins.  Still loosing hair.  Not as bad but not sure which product is working.</li>
    <li> i chose to give 5 stars because there&#x27;s not a single thing not to like about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, great product for decent price, it has a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an old man losing hair, and hopefully i&#x27;ll get my hair back after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep updating, and I&#x27;ll recommend this to my peers as well.</li>
    <li> I just received my hair loss prevention shampoo in the mail today. I jumped in the shower right away to use it. It smells wonderful and I can&#x27;t wait to show off my hair wants it grows back healthy again!</li>
    <li> Personally I choose to only wash my hair 2-3 times a week because I feel like the natural grease helps it be healthy and I just started using this this week and even the first time I noticed a difference. My hair gets pretty greasey obviously and I had to use less of this and it was clean faster, and then felt better after. I see some review complaining about dry scalp or drandruff, and I haven&#x27;t had that experience this week at all but I also use conditioner so maybe thats why, hopefully it won&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;ll prob do another review after like a month of use, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week now and so for it works great so far, but I will need to see the results in the long run. The smell is subtle, but I like it. I can understand why some people may not like the smell as much though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Id recommend this product. Pricing wise it is somewhere in the mid to high range, but worth it as it probably will last a while.</li>
    <li> I wanted to really like this product...my hair is thinning and I want it to grow back and thicken more of course so I bought this shampoo! I love the ingredients and I have faith in this shampoo but it was a bit drying to my hair!!! I will continue to use it and use oil on my hair after the shower to moisturize.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product because of a review I saw when thinking about buying more Nioxin online.&lt;br /&gt;I am almost done with my 1st bottle and I plan to buy it again. (along with the conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;My hair is super fine but it is also wavy and frizzy. It is so hard to find a product that gives me volume without drying me out and this has been the perfect combination for me.&lt;br /&gt;Defiantly think this is a superior product to Aveda&#x27;s hair loss/ thickening shampoo and Nioxin!&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I like that it uses organic/ natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo and conditioner, I then use a small amount of volumizing mousse - Living proof Brand from Sephora.</li>
    <li> I have only use the product for two weeks now, therefore I am only giving it four stars. After I have finished the bottle I will do another review again. In the meantime for the last two weeks my daughter, her 2 children, and I have use the product every day,  we like it so far. We use it every day after we go swimming in the pool and using the spa. Our hair is so soft and fluffy, as for her loss prevention, and have yet to find out if that works.</li>
    <li> Useful to control hair falling and very effective without harsh chemicals, I use it regularly more than 8 months. I will get another orders.</li>
    <li> 2014 -- It does make my hair have a nice texture and seem thicker.  I don&#x27;t know about the hair loss thing yet, since mine never did fall out in clumps (a problem which some reviewers here seem to think improves with this product), my hair has just slowly been getting thinner and more transparent (is that even possible?) over the years.  If I love it in 6th months, I&#x27;ll review it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2017 -- OK, I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now.  I think my hair is a little fuller, but that may be due to lots of supplements that I take (biotin, msm, saw palmetto, beta sitosterol, evening primrose oil), reduced stress, topical use of castor oil, or maybe it just looks better with a new haircut.  Still lots of micro thin transparent hairs, but the thicker darker hairs seem to be hanging in there.</li>
    <li> I decided to update this review because I wrote it before I even learned or realized that reviews on Amazon can be fake or paid reviews. Please don&#x27;t give any more money to this or any company until you look at the profiles of the 5 star reviewers.  If they have reviewed only this item or only a few similar items...all with glowing reviews...be skeptical. After faithfully using this shampoo every day for 2 weeks, my hair started falling out at an alarming rate. After discontinuing use, the hair loss has substantially slowed, but the damage is done AND A YEAR LATER HAS NOT RECOVERED.</li>
    <li> best ive ever found for my hair</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 10 days back and have used a few times. It does not seem to have the usual chemical smell associated with traditional shampoos. I am monitoring and hoping this product will work. It is too early to conclude.</li>
    <li> Very good hair loss shampoo.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I first came across pura d&#x27;or shampoo from groupon, liked it ever since.  I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos like Revivogen and Nizoral, but this is the simplest shampoo, because it&#x27;s organic, no harsh chemicals.  I&#x27;ve stuck with this shampoo exclusively, and I like the results better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best shampoo I have ever used, hands down.  I&#x27;ve  tried many high quality shampoos over the years and don&#x27;t consider buying anything else now.  My hair is left clean with no oily feel. This product eliminates the need to buy a conditioner for me.  My hair continues to \\&quot;thrive\\&quot; and I believe the hair loss prevention claims by the manufacturer are warranted.</li>
    <li> This product was great and i recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I have used this product for years.  Gentle yet gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Its alright. It definitely stops hair loss as I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;ve been shedding a whole lot less. The problem is that it leaves my hair extremely dry and frizzled looking. You&#x27;ll need to use a lot of conditioner after using this shampoo to counteract the drying effect. I haven&#x27;t seen any new hair growing but I haven&#x27;t been losing any so that is a plus.</li>
    <li> DOESN&#x27;T SMELL ALL THAT GOOD, BUT I THINK IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> have not noticed much difference in hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve been using it a week, and my hair and scalp feel and look good. It&#x27;s bad to put all those harsh chemicals on your scalp, especially everyday. I think I see some hair follicles coming in, too. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo.  It leaves my hair feeling really clean and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have all then chemicals of regular brands.  plus it does not dry out my hair, like normal shampoo.  The cost may see expensive at first, but you only need to use a little bit so the bottle lasts a really, really long time.  Because the bottle lasts so long, it&#x27;s actually cheaper over time than middle of the road priced shampoos from the pharmacy or grocery store, so your money is really well spent if you consider how many washes you get out of a bottle.  I wash my hair once a day and a bottle lasts me several months.  Note, this shampoo does not foam up like store shampoos but that is a good thing.  I am not giving it 5 stars only because I can&#x27;t 100% confirm how well it works for hair loss prevention, I say this because I&#x27;m also doing other things for that problem so I can&#x27;t pinpoint it&#x27;s the shampoo, but it&#x27;s definitely not hurting. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo,not really sure I have notice hair loss prevention - but maybe it has.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to tell when you already have had thinning hair for a time</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of pura d&#x27;or shampoo and I love the way it makes my hair feel.  I have fine, thin hair and it makes my hair feel thicker and fuller.  I would definitely recommend this product to people that have the same problem with fine hair that is starting to thin out.</li>
    <li> In the few months that I have used this shampoo, I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m keeping more hair on my head and not as much in the shower, sink, floor, towel, clothes, etc. I don&#x27;t think my hair is thicker yet, but I&#x27;m confident that it will get thicker in time. The shampoo does not smell good, but when it&#x27;s rinsed out, I can&#x27;t smell it anymore. Also, the pump doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s stuck in the closed position and I can&#x27;t get it &amp;#34;unlocked.&amp;#34; So I unscrew the top and wipe off the shampoo clinging to the tube onto my hand. I will buy more when this bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is slimy; you will have sort of make some later and apply on wet hair. It actually left my hair very dry, and I see my hair breaking a lot these days.  I didn&#x27;t get their conditioner, perhaps that would help. I cant really say if this has improved or hair health!</li>
    <li> I used this and the conditioner,the entire bottle, and I did notice my hair significantly improve- what I noticed more was it felt fuller and thicker. I had a couple of &amp;#34;bald spots&amp;#34; on my hair line where my hair was significantly thinning and falling out, after about 2 months I saw the &amp;#34;bald spots&amp;#34; fill in with new baby hairs! I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I want to try a second bottle and see if it improves even more, but after my first bottles I was honestly impressed!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Lathers up really well with one little push. Leaves my hair feeling clean. slowly but surely getting good results.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is organic and natural with no SLS and parabens. It has prevented my hair loss any further and my hair looks healthier. I also have to use less as it lathers really well and washes clean. I still have a quarter of bottle remaining since I have stared using it in the past nine months. I would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really like how this cleans my hair, and I feel as though it has already shown some improvement as far as thickness goes.  I haven&#x27;t had it that long so I&#x27;m hoping for even more improvement in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have used other hair loss shampoo and they made my hair fall. This one really strengthens my hair and have it feeling really soft thanks to the tea tree oil and no SLS. I am impressed with it.</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoos that I have ever had. It really works well, I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality that this product has! Will definitely continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> There are few products that I&#x27;m devoted to.  This is one of them.  Long lasting and gentle on my hair, when I completed by first bottle, I tried a couple of weeks without it.  I knew I had to find it again and was so glad to see this on Amazon.  I originally got this to reduce hair loss and it does work to a degree.  Basically I think it&#x27;s a lot healthier than  the chemicals that compose most shampoos.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Most organic shampoos and conditioners leave you hair feeling more oily and stringy. But not this shampoo! It actually leaves my hair feeling soft, full of volume, and even helps my scalp!</li>
    <li> It worked for the first 2 months but after awhile I received slight hair loss.</li>
    <li> My order arrived unscrewed at the top and the shampoo was spilled all over the box.  I managed to salvage a little, as I have always wanted to try it, and it just does not lather up or rinse out.  I am not impressed with this shampoo at all. Maybe I got a bad batch??</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my own fault.  I should have looked at the oz. size in the description and compared it to something.  I feel like I got ripped off.  This bottle is tiny and this stuff smells like crap.  It&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s at least thickening or not, but it doesn&#x27;t lather up very well and that doesn&#x27;t give me a whole lot of confidence that it&#x27;s hitting my hair evenly.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo twice a week for about 4 months and I notice less hair loss. However, the shampoo separates into 2 parts and I can&#x27;t pump the thicker part.</li>
    <li> Good product, my scalp looks healthier, my hair looks smooth and shiny. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months, hair loss has not stopped but has reduced. Didn´t help for my thinning hair, I just bought the gold label to try</li>
    <li> I have used this product daily for about 3 weeks.  It lathers nicely, and I like the smell.  It leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.  My hair loss seems to have tapered off since I have been using it, but it is too soon to say whether it will encourage new growth.  I like the dispenser...much easier than having to unscrew a top while you&#x27;re in the shower.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for two years.  I purchased because I noticed my hairline receding and wanted to stop the retreat.  I feel good enough about the product to keep ordering</li>
    <li> It is my favorite hair loss prevention product so far. I have tried a lot of other Shampoo + Conditioner products in the past. Nevertheless, I have found that my hair loss slows down to the normal rate (100-200 strands a day) while I am using Pura d&#x27;or shampoo. My scalp is always well hydrated and not fat after using Pura d&#x27;or. Other hair loss prevention shampoos cased my scalp to become dry after several weeks of use. I am happy with this product even without a conditioner, because my hair and scalp look and feel healthy after just a few washes with Pura d&#x27;or. I do not stop using it.</li>
    <li> Ok. Nothing, of course, will regrow your hair. But this is great shampoo. It certainly adds volume and makes you look like you  might have more hair. Does it stop hair loss? It&#x27;s really too soon to tell. But it&#x27;s a shampoo, not a miracle worker. Still, I recommend it. You never know and it does make your hair feel thicker.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father a year ago.  He still uses it today.</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice, so far, but I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I have just received this shampoo along with the conditioner and argan oil. I&#x27;ve been in the process of getting my hair colour back to dark brown after numerous bleaches and reds in the last few months. My hair has been dry with a lot of breakage. I just washed my hair once and have already noticed a great difference. My hair was softer, shiner, smelled great! I also noticed that my split ends seemed to be non-split, as if they were sealed together. I still have to use this product for a longer period of time, but for a first time wash, I was quite surprised.</li>
    <li> So, I just had a baby and my hair is falling out like crazy! I needed to do something to stop it from falling out or help it grow back faster, but I&#x27;m nursing so I can&#x27;t really take anything that&#x27;s unnatural… and it doesn&#x27;t help that I have long hair too. SIGH.  :(&lt;br /&gt;After researching the internet and talking to people, I found out that this organic shampoo may be able to help… but it&#x27;s EXPENSIVE! But I&#x27;m desperate, fine, I&#x27;ll give it a shot and if it doesn&#x27;t work, I won&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this about 1.5 weeks ago… The shampoo lathers fairly well, and there&#x27;s no real smell to it… doesn&#x27;t tingle or anything either… so it&#x27;s definitely different from the old Nioxin shampoo.&lt;br /&gt; I know it is too early to tell if it&#x27;s really working or not, but so far it appears that the current amount of hair loss is less than before I started using it… yes, I counted. LOL. When you&#x27;re losing as much hair as I am, every strand of hair counts. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be back to update my review after I finish the bottle. Stay tuned! ;)</li>
    <li> Really cannot say if the product works or not...only tried it once and could not stand the stench.  I seriously had to rewash my hair 2 times to get the smell out.  I&#x27;m returning it today. If you have an over-sensitive aversion to bad smells like me, this product is NOT for you.</li>
    <li> I started using this about 3 days ago. The shampoo lathers fairly well, and there&#x27;s no real smell to it… doesn&#x27;t tingle or anything either… so it&#x27;s definitely different from other shampoos. I really like it. I hope it helps prevent hair loss with time.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great! It has become the only shampoo I use. I am a 20 year old male and I was looking for a shampoo that would help me keep my hair because I come from a long line of men who have male pattern baldness, I have been seeing about 30 hairs in my drain every time I shower, plus a few more through out the day. My father lost all his hair in his early 20s. This shampoo has been good to me so far, this shampoo feels organic, the smell is something similar to smelling a bunch of herbs at the same time. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for 6 months more or less, (I take a shower every other day), and I remember the first time I used this it completely changed the way my hair feels. It feels THICK which is great, one other nice feature is that it leaves my scalp a bit dry (I&#x27;ve always suffered from an oily scalp and this shampoo gets rid of the oily feeling). I have seen new hairs sprout near my hairline (I do not know if it is because of the shampoo alone or that I have been eating healthier). Overall this shampoo is really great, I can&#x27;t promise you won&#x27;t lose any more hair (I still find hairs in the drain; 5 hairs to be exact :D) but it will GREATLY reduce the amount you lose which is promising than other products out there. Plus it&#x27;s shampoo, which means you will not forget to use it every time you shower, give it a try! Who knows it may work for you.  EDIT: I stopped buying this brand since the formula has changed drastically, now it smells like chemicals and leaves a burning sensation on my scalp I do not recommend this for hair growth, not even as a regular shampoo. Do not waste your money, they changed the formula that actually worked.</li>
    <li> Still not working  for me...... probably  work for others  but didn&#x27;t  work for me Im still  losing  my hair 😞</li>
    <li> This shampoo feels healing</li>
    <li> Great product smells a bit medicine but scalp feels much better !</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo, Does control hair. Love it. It leaves hair silky smooth and manageable. Hair does not fall out. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have finished one bottle of this shampoo and I am happy with the results. The quality seems very good and it has a good smell. I switched from Nioxin shampoo to this and I do feel like this is more effective, although I did like the smell of Nioxin more. I will continue to order this shampoo as I have been happy with it. When shampoo.I feel like this shampoo is the only thing I need to use to keep my hair feeling thick and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have been having hair loss for many years. I have tried so many shampoo products from grocery store products to expensive salon products. I have even ordered Wen hair care products. And nothing has worked for me like Pura d&#x27;or. My hair is very fine and thin. Before using Pura d&#x27;or my hair loss was very concerning. Since using this l no longer have severe hair loss and I can brush my hair without worry. I also have new growth. This is a must have product for me.</li>
    <li> We have bought this more than once. Probably need to order more as we speak. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and the conditioner, it really makes a difference when you are experiencing hair loss, it gives you that fullness, and actually works in helping your hair grow back, now it may not work for everyone but it does for me, the only thing you may want to do in buying this product is, moisturize your scalp it does make your scalp very dry.... however, i recommend this product...</li>
    <li> I LOVED IT. IT  IS SO EFFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;I USED IT FOR THREE WEEKS AND MY HAIR THAT WAS FALLING OFF STOPPED FALLING. NOW MY HAIR IS BACK TO NORMAL.&lt;br /&gt;I  WOULD ADVISE EVERYONE WHOSE HAIR IS FALLING OFF TO USE THIS PRODUCT INSTANTLY.</li>
    <li> I am using the hairmax lasercomb along with this product.... I think that&#x27;s a great combination..... I think I have seen a little improvement of my scalp condition after using the two products simultaneously......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only have have it for a week and I love the smell one ,two I&#x27;ve been seeing no hair fall out I&#x27;m really enjoying this product highly recommended it</li>
    <li> Start using this product because my friend gave it to me and this is my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I always believe that not all products are suitable for everyone, but for me this product works.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair clean and I drop less hair with each wash.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to people with begins hair loss.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works,  It is my 3rd bottle.  My husband and I both use it, several times a week and we both see a marked improvement in new hair growth as well as hair loss.  Shampoo in and leave it on for 2-3 minutes before rinsing.  It is a great product that does what is claims to do.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Conditioner (16 fl. oz.) along with the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo for about 8 months, and have ssen positive results such as:&lt;br /&gt;- No more top of head hair loss which is genetic in our family&lt;br /&gt;- New hair growning in what was once a completely bald spot on top of head&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say with absolute certainty that the new hair growth is due to the Pura d&#x27;or products, or from no longer using the cheaper &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; Wal-Mart type of hair products that leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on the hair &amp; scalp after use</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this shampoo and I have seen positive results with my hair over the past year.  It feels natural unlike a lot of other hair-loss shampoos on the market.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair has less fallout and thicker. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo itself is milky in color and creamy. Smell is somewhat comparable to tea tree oil but not as strong and minty. The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last in the hair. The shampoo is good if you need something that nourishes hair and calms frizies. If I continue to use this shampoo, I will need to add into the rotation something to strip the hair every now and then as I&#x27;m afraid my hair might get too greasy / have build up. I&#x27;m also not entirely convinced this is the right shampoo for someone with thin hair as it makes it softer and flatter, not fuller. I will have to check in at a later date to re-review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle gives a good synopsis of the product but doesn&#x27;t directly list ingredients in order of occurrence (i.e., which parts are greatest in quantity).</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and smells good too. Have not used it very long but my hair loss in drain seems less.</li>
    <li> That was a love from first sight then I use them on my hair.  Last for a long time.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle now and I love the product. Great smell. Great feel. Great price!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for awhile now, and I bought this a bottle for my husband. I have definitely noticed the amount of hair loss is a lot less after showering. The fact it&#x27;s Paraben free, no SOS or harsh chemicals was a big selling point for me. The bottle last quite a while because it&#x27;s really thick and you only have to use a little.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this shampoo.  I&#x27;m really happy with the list of ingredients (it has everything I want and nothing I don&#x27;t want!). I definitely feel a difference in the health of my scalp which used to be irritated and red.  It also leaves my hair healthy and clean and easy to style. It has a light herbal scent which I really like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this product and have found it helpful. Unlike some of the other shampoos I had tried in the past, it has a great citrus smell (at least to me) and it leaves my hair looking and feeling healthy. I also noticed I don&#x27;t shed hair as much as I used to over the course of the day and thought I can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s 100% resulting from the shampoo I&#x27;m sure it has had a role in that change. I was looking for a product that would prevent hair loss rather than re-growth so my perspective is from someone that wants to keep their hair healthy and in place.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo after reading the many great reviews. Because it isn&#x27;t cheap, I only got the shampoo and not the conditioner. I washed my hair and left it on for 2 minutes (and it is hard to leave 2 products on for 2 minutes in one shower!).  After about a month or even weeks, my hair is filled in on my scalp. I have long hair and you used to be able to see my wide part all the time. Now my hair is all filled in. I wish I could show you the photos. Before and After. It is AMAZING!!! I now ordered the conditioner and have used it 2 times. I shower and leave the shampoo on and then get out and put the conditioner on and a shower hat and rinse in the sink after I get dressed. The conditioner makes my hair easier to comb. Oh, I wait until my hair is dry to comb when using these products....and I don&#x27;t feel the need to use a straightener after conditioning, as I have dyed hair. I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO..and so far the conditioner. If I can&#x27;t afford both, I will definitely get just the shampoo. I have got many compliments on how fast my hair got long too!~ A GIFT FROM GOD &amp;lt;*&gt;&amp;lt;~~~~~~~~~~~ ps. now I can stay a brunette and stop hiding my thin scalp hair by dying it blonde :)</li>
    <li> Used a few times and I like it.  Even though it is pricey, I only need to use a little bit.  Haven&#x27;t seen any significant change in hair loss but I see more shine.  When the hair is wet I feel dry but when the hair become soft after they are dry.  I also follow the instruction by massaging Pura d&#x27;or into scalp for 2 minutes and use the conditioner.  So far so good.  Hope I can see my hair getting thicker soon</li>
    <li> just started using and not bad so far. left it in my hair for 3-5 minutes, lathers well, rinsed out good. less hair in the tub after i rinsed it out but left my hair very tangled. used the same conditioner and hair still tangled. definitely more body but also more frizz when hair dried. will keep using but with another conditioner. will update later re hair loss, to early to tell now.</li>
    <li> Product works great! All natural, noticed a difference in thickness right away. Nice smell without being overly strong. Highly recommend! Have already re-ordered.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever used. Love it and will buy it over and over again. I see my grey is going away a bit, which is a nice surprise. But, most of all love the way my hair feels and looks as well as my scalp. It leaves my dry hair smooth and silky without using any other products to make it that way. Incredible shampoo for anyone.</li>
    <li> So far, this shampoo has been doing a great job, my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much anymore and it does not dry out my hair like other shampoos. I only use it 3-4 times a week and i switch from baby shampoo and back to this every other day. The smell isnt too bad either. and I would continue using it to see the full effects.</li>
    <li> Probably still need more time, as this product is a marathon, not a sprint.  Definitely feel a tingling when using, so that must mean something.  Hard to describe the scent- it&#x27;s very unique, but pleasant.  Fist impressions are that hair loss has been reduced.  I&#x27;ll definitely give it more time and give it the benefit of the doubt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Loss Prevention shampoo for a few weeks, so it&#x27;s too early to tell if it actually promotes hair growth (I&#x27;ll probably have to use it for 6 months before I make a determination).  But, as a shampoo, it cleans my hair well and smells good.  So, even if it doesn&#x27;t increase hair on my scalp, I might continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel very nice after a shower. It smells good and has a very nice suds effect when I wash my hair with it. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days so I can&#x27;t comment on how it&#x27;s helped helped hair loss but I will update this post when I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before. My husband and I liked their quality and natural fragrance, so we purchased again in Amazon and introduced to our friend. Well, it&#x27;s expensive but it seems works to me and my husband, our hair loss has lessen than before and now we keep buy this product and Pura d&#x27;or hair conditioner as well. I think it is worth to buy this product to keep my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e been using this product for over a year now along with the conditioner and have noticed a lot less hair coming out in the shower,  this shampoo is great!! it definitely works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 39 year old female with extremely thinning hair that was starting to effect my daily life - I was embarrassed to take my kids swimming because when my hair was wet it was even more prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first but after one try I noticed my hair is shiner and I&#x27;ve had significantly less hair loss because I monitor it with a screen over our shower drain. I now have small fine hairs coming in (confirmed by my dermatologist I see for my thinning hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way to create a rich lather and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on other brands and I feel like I finally found a shampoo that addresses my hair loss where I actually see results.</li>
    <li> Good product..Solid list of ingredients. Doesnt dry the scalp, good used in conjustion with other products. Noticed less hair loss</li>
    <li> The volume of my hair has definitely increased. Me and my hair are very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product is pure organic and it does wonders for my hair</li>
    <li> The shampoo I bought has a sticky, slimy consistency that makes it impossible to actually work into a lather. It&#x27;s like trying to spread snot into your hair. I&#x27;m highly debating just dumping this junk into the trash, and I can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much money on this terrible product. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return it either since the return window expired. Maybe it was just the batch that ended up like that, but buyers beware! I&#x27;m not the only customer who had this same problem.    Edit: I was highly annoyed with the product at first, but I contacted the company directly for a refund and they were very agreeable and nice about it. I would suggest that others who have similar experiences do the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 3 weeks and can say that from the first week, I have noticed less hair in the shower drain and on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;My hair and scalp feel great. While 3 weeks is not enough time to determine if new hair growth is in the future, I can say that I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo because I have been losing my once very thick, coarse, curly hair. In research learned that I should be using a DHT blocker shampoo. I read all the reviews on Amazon before making my choice of Purad&#x27;or.  I read that it smells bad, personally I have no complaint, neither bad nor good. I have used extremely bad smelling products and this is cake walk for me. I also read that it made some peoples hair soft and no need to use conditioner ( that made me sit up taller and notice) I have found I personally still need to use conditioner &amp; maintain my twice weekly Braggs apple cider vinegar. I notice my hair does look fuller, however it is too soon to tell if it is helping with my loss. I will continue to use this shampoo for awhile, I know that anything works over time.</li>
    <li> Friend recommended to me, and it works! What&#x27;s more, I like the smell!</li>
    <li> Just had my first wash with it last night. My best friend swore by it for the past year and showed results so I decided to try it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell that some of the other reviewers are complaining about is definitely exaggerated and unnoticeable. My hair had a very nice texture afterwards, not overly dry like some of the other shampoos I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people don&#x27;t read the directions which make a difference with these kind of products, it asks that you lather and leave on for 2 minutes, which is easy to do, just lather your hair first and wash the rest of your body before rinsing. I will update again in a month to review the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy and I would recommend to other users for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I have very fine hair and I feel like every other shampoo is maybe too rough for my hair. Every wash I have hair falling out but with this product I have less hair falling out. And my hair always feels so clean but not weighed down at all. It&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> The parador Aragon oil premium organic shampoo smells fantastic.It makes my hair feel really clean and soft. I&#x27;ve used it a few times so it&#x27;s too early to review the hair growth results. The only problem I had with this product is that it was open in the box, it spilled about I/4 of the shampoo in the box.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive scalp and oily hair. After being used about three weeks. My scalp doesn&#x27;t have any irritation and I feel a little bit less oily with my hair after a whole day. It does not hurt my eyes either.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times but the comments of thick and stringy definitely make it almost impossible to pump it out. Not to fond of that</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  My scalp and hair feels great!  This was my first time using an organic shampoo and I will def use it again!</li>
    <li> I usually use desert essence organic shampoo but have been experiencing hair loss because of a recent surgery so I decided to try this. I  was worried about the scent but I actually really like it! The product does what it says, it has minimized my hair loss and made my hair soft and manageable. Haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner yet but am going to. A little expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is great and lathers up very well.  As was stated in previous reviews, only a small amount is needed to completely cover the head so I would imagine that this bottle will go a long way.  I have noticed less hair loss and I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use it will get even better.  I will be buying it again, whenever I do run out!</li>
    <li> I have been shedding hair and decided to try a new shampoo. My shedding lessened after using this, but I can&#x27;t say 100% that this is the cause since I have been trying many different things. I replaced my old organic shampoo from wholesale foods with this since it feels better</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Just as advertised. It has stopped my hair loss and it&#x27;s a bonus that it&#x27;s an organic product.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ve been using the Pura d&#x27;Or Hair Loss Prevention shampoo for two weeks, and I&#x27;ve been seeing less of my hair in the vacuum, and in the bathtub strainer. My hair looks much more hydrated as well. I exercise almost daily, so I appreciate that this product is gentle enough to use every day. Hoping that the good results will continue.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it gives my hair body and is great for my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I am using it for the past 1 month. It creates dandruff. I do not have it before using it. I dont suggest this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Hair seems fuller and less brittle right out of the gate. Good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shampoo for hair lose and retrieving hair color back. After using it for a month I see lots of changes in my hair strength and not losing a lot of hair. I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 weeks and probably would not have bought it if I had realized it was so similar to a shampoo set I already had. Argan oil is not the nicest scent, but it isn&#x27;t bothersome. My hair does seem to stay cleaner longer than with a normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was only okay, because it is a pump bottle which somehow opened on the way so there was shampoo over the inside of the box. But I think it was a freak occurance because the bottle was still 90% wrapped in the original plastic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wondrous, has stopped hair loss</li>
    <li> i found this shampoo in the internet.&lt;br /&gt;i did searh because my hair start fall of.&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo it&#x27;s work but not as i thot</li>
    <li> Best one, need to buy more...</li>
    <li> been using it for over a year, and I won&#x27;t stop, it&#x27;s really great, although it&#x27;s hard to assess the hair loss prevention, it&#x27;s very smooth, and lasts a long time</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the same use this shampoo or don&#x27;t use this shampoo&lt;br /&gt;what a waste of money. doesn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
    <li> One of the best products ive ever used. Pura d&#x27;or, it beyond the best brand. I will never use another brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo since it moisturizes hair and has all natural ingredients. Along with moisturizing, this has ingredients that can help prevent further thinning of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the shampoo does not weigh down hair and won&#x27;t leave any noticeable residue. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have used this shampoo for almost a year and I can say this is one of the better Hair Loss Prevention shampoos out there. Though this shampoo does not arrest hair fall, it slows the process down. It has a very nice scent and washes clean. Will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Been using for about a month. Hair feels stronger and thicker :)</li>
    <li> Decent everyday shampoo. Not overly strong or drying... No strong odors or stickiness. Not sure if it works as stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Price was $22 jumped up to $30. Not such a great deal until price is within low 20&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a year now and I love it. It really does stop your hair from falling out as much and overtime you will see new growth. When I say new growth I dont mean you&#x27;ll be growing out tons of hair but any new growth is good to me! Best of all this shampoo has helped my seborric dermatitis better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used even prescription shampoo. It leaves my hair very healthy to top it all off. I do recommend using another shampoo before this one if you have a lot of product in your hair, as with many organics it will tend to lather better if your hair is not so dirty. I like to use this shampoo in conjunction with Avalan Organics Biotin thickening shampoo and they work great together!</li>
    <li> This product is quite good. I have not seen my hair fall out as it was in the past. I do note some drying of my hair though.</li>
    <li> very nice product helps tremendously</li>
    <li> After 6 weeks of daily use, I find my hair has more diameter, feels thicker, and is not drying to my scalp. Even my hairdresser has noticed a difference!</li>
    <li> I starting using Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo when I received it from my daughter for a gift. I have since ordered my 2nd bottle because this shampoo makes my hair look healthier, thicker and feels stronger. Pura d&#x27;or adds volume to my hair and leaves shinny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to have found this product and will continue to use the shampoo in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Susan Mazzei&lt;br /&gt;Age 63</li>
    <li> I have been using this Hair Loss shampoo, along with the conditioner for about six months now.  I&#x27;m a 25 year old male with a receding hairline and thinning hair on the top of my head.  The products have made my hair significantly stronger over the past few months.  I&#x27;ve noticed less hair falling out and my hair feels a lot healthier.  Will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> My hair feels and looks softer and the body and bounce lasts till the next day.  I love it! I want to continue using it for a long time. This is my first bottle I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  I love that it has Argan Oil and all natural ingredients. My hair does feel healthier and looks it too.</li>
    <li> Just received this a few days ago but I am really enjoying this shampoo. Thicker, healthier looking hair. Hopefully it keeps hair from coming out as well. Love that it is made from organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I will definetly buy this shampoo again. I have used it for 3 weeks now. I don&#x27;t know about the hair growth since I have curly hair its hard to tell but I notice less shedding. Even my husband noticed less hair in the shower. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love these products. They have good things in them and I am comfortable to use them on my hair. I have bought them before and will continue to be their customer. I recommend the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Product line!</li>
    <li> I will need more time to determine if this product has actually slowed hair loss. However, I really love the smell of the shampoo, it reminds me personally of ginger, and produces a good lather. An added bonus is that this product is organic and uses recycled plastic for the environmentally conscious.</li>
    <li> just tried out this shampoo for the first time and it woeks great, nice lather and smell. can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results!</li>
    <li> Every time I use this shampoo my scalp feels amazing.  It feels clean and fresh.  The smell of the shampoo is not excessive and has a slight natural but  &amp;#34;shampooy&amp;#34;  scent.  I like the smell and the texture.  You just need 1 and half pumps if you moderately long hair and just 1 pump if you have a clip 8 length or less.&lt;br /&gt;I did my research on several organic products and I&#x27;m really glad I chose this product.  I bought this shampoo to get very clean feel and stop losing excess hair.  I used other common brand shampoos and it never made my scalp feels this clean.  Also my hair looks much healthier and slightly thicker.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but if your losing hair in your early twenties, you have to try this.  I know DHT was one of my problems because hair loss isn&#x27;t that common in my family and this shampoo aims to block DHT and seems to be working. And plus makes your hair look great too.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I think it&#x27;s stopping my side part from becoming a comb-over.  Can&#x27;t ask anything more from a $22 bottle of shampoo.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I was kind of at skeptical about this at first. But it really has seemed to help with my hair. Will definitely keep using!  Nice cool tingly feeling when lathering, pretty cool!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have short hair, so a bottle will last several months. I think my hair looks better and a little fuller when I use this shampoo so I haven&#x27;t switched since I started using it last year.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well. It takes about 6 weeks to start to see improvements. Not a miracle, but it definitely works! I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. The fact it&#x27;s all natural is great and the consistency is just right. Not sure it&#x27;s preventing hair loss but maybe if we believe a shampoo can do this, it will happen. All about mindset! In any case, my hair looks good after using it.</li>
    <li> I am not sure whether it is effective for my hair or no. However, my hear loss is Not getting worse after three months using.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo in September, and keep using it for more than 2 month now. I think I have enough experience about how this product works now. At first, I think this product does not meet my expectation, because my hair feels unruly after washing it without conditioner. But I keep using it hoping to increase the volume of my hair. About 20 days later, my scalp seems to fit this shampoo and become more smooth. And what&#x27;s more, there is more new hair growing out in my hairline. I want to keep using it to see what it will be in the future.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! I have been experiencing hair loss for several months and was feeling desperate to find something to help. I do not believe in using harsh chemicals on my hair so I thought I would give this a try. I am so grateful that I did.  My hair loss has completely stopped other then what would be considered normal hair loss. I even did a video review for this product on my YouTube channel. You can watch the video here: http://youtu.be/NWHEvJ2d1fo</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my son.  He raved about this shampoo so much I now use it myself.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Already see the result after one bottle</li>
    <li> Need shampoo that give you a deep cleansing feel.</li>
    <li> Been using it for almost three months and it does prevent hair loos by keeping hair healthy. It cleans scalp without drying hair.  No need for conditioner with this shampoo.  While originally skeptical over the company&#x27;s incentives for customers to review the product, it is indeed the best shampoo I have tried in the last 20 years to prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> I had originally rated this 1 star, however, after trying it out for a few days I changed my mind, it does makes your hair soft and fuller, so I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother.  She liked it.</li>
    <li> I do like this product a lot. I can&#x27;t say that it dramatically reduces hair loss but it is gentle so possibly it prevents further damage. I leaves my hair with some volume which is nice because it is pretty flat most of the time. And the scent is great.</li>
    <li> Shampoo works well on my fine hair without weighing it down. I have not used it long enough to speak to it&#x27;s claim to prevent further hair loss, but I will order a second bottle.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a couple weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. it hasn&#x27;t really stopped my hair loss, it has actually furthered it I think. I recently found out that I&#x27;m losing hair because my scalp is so dry, and I think this makes me scalp even dryer.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a change. Smells good and lathers well. I&#x27;m using it in combo with biotin and pumpkin seed oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly two months, and I must say that I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of hair loss I had been experiencing.  The shampoo has a pleasant smell and feels good on the scalp.  I intend to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo in order to slow down my hair loss.  I have just been using it a little over two weeks.  As promised, my hair looks and feels much thicker.  There seems to be much less hair in my comb and brush so it appears that it is limiting the loss of hair.  I am hoping for some hair regrowth and I am also currently taking some vitamins that contain biotin to help grow new hair.  I am hopeful that the shampoo and vitamins will give me some good results in a few months.  Yes, I recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using similar products for about 6 months now.  I compared ingredients, scent, and post-wash feel with the other brands I have tried.  This is my favorite.  I am not sure if it will ever cause my hair to regrow (although I hope it will), but it is a very high quality shampoo that doesn&#x27;t contain any of the normal potentially harmful chemicals of normal shampoos.  The price per ounce is near unbeatable for this type of shampoo, so chalk another one up for Pura d&#x27;or.  I will post updates in the next 6 months to a year.</li>
    <li> I think this product is working, although I am also taking vitamins for my hair too.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint might be is that its heavy in my hair, weighs it down and looks a little greasy,  so I wash. It again with my regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love it. This is my 5th bottle I think. Wish I had less bills to pay, so I could buy more. I</li>
    <li> This is the finest shampoo I have used to tame my thinning hair that is extremely susceptible to high humidity.  Although it obviously doesn&#x27;t promote new hair growth, it seems that it controls hair loss and keeps my hair feeling silky and soft.  It has a nice aroma and I love the fact that it is all natural and contains essential oils and other hair loss preventing compounds</li>
    <li> This product works amazing.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells good. Feels good. Nice packaging. I hope it helps me retain my hair. I look good with hair, so I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Mah hair is gettin lush and sexy again! This stuff Is good. Switched to it eer since I heard Nioxin factory for bought and moved to Mexico and isn&#x27;t the same anymore. And this is organic!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a week. I have noticed my hair falling lesser after using this product, but I can&#x27;t comment on regrowth at this point. I don&#x27;t think I expect regrowth, but I am happy that my hair is falling lesser. I will definitely stick to this shampoo as it lathers well, has natural ingredients and makes my hair fall lesser. However I would suggest using a conditioner after this shampoo as it makes my hair a little dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two weeks, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet. But from all the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I am still hopeful for less hair loss through continued use. The smell of this shampoo isn&#x27;t that great. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s unpleasant, but don&#x27;t expect the scent of your regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a hair loss prevention product of any kind.  I am more of a health products kind of girl.  I was looking for an all natural product to use and this is what I settled on.  I was not expecting a &amp;#34;fix all, overnight&amp;#34; product.  So far, I have noticed that I have less hair falling out in the shower.  I am also more careful while using this product, so that might also have an effect.  The shampoo smells great and lathers wonderful for me.  I will give it the full 30 days to see the effects after a month.  I have taken a picture also, to see if I will be able to see a difference.  I am excited!  This is expensive, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, if I don&#x27;t notice more of a positive effect after the 30 days.  I was also a little upset that Aloe vera was not an ingredient.</li>
    <li> left my hair feeling weird. did not see any noticeable difference. not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> I just recently bought this product. How many times a week would you recommend me using this?</li>
    <li> when i bought this product for a first time i was skeptical , but since then i haven&#x27;t stop using it and I RECOMMEND IT to everyone !!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and I was worried that the oils would make my hair appear oily, but it didn&#x27;t.  In fact, at first I didn&#x27;t read the directions and it says to let it sit a few before rinsing. After I started leaving it in a bit, I found that I can go without a separate conditioner.  I would like to add the conditioner to my routine though, maybe after my old stuff runs out.  Although it advertises all the things it doesn&#x27;t contain I was happy that it still has a lather to it while shampooing.  The scent reminds me of eucalyptus, although it&#x27;s not too strong or over powering.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered earlier than scheduled. Product size was great, not too big and not too small. Love the color of the bottle. Package delivered in great condition. I will definitely order this product again for refill.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this order :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and I am very happy with the results. In addition to stopping my hair loss, it leaves your hair and head feeling great without any overbearing fragrance.</li>
    <li> Speedy Delivery.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great product..helps with hair loss..leaving hair conditioned and soft</li>
    <li> Made my hair dry and matted.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about two weeks now.  My hair appears to be shinier than before. I have noticed little fuzz growing on my scalp. no major increases of hair yet.</li>
    <li> Very nice gentle and great smelling Shampoo..</li>
    <li> good quality. good price.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It suds up good for a natural product. My hair feels softer.ive been using it for 2 months so im not sure if I have new growth but ill keep using it.</li>
    <li> Its been a week since I have been using this shampoo and i have seen amazing results. I am 26 year old guy with starting signs of male pattern baldness and i have tried everything , every natural shampoo.. but there was one thing or another in them that made my scalp very dry. When i used this shampoo i expected the same but to my surprise after first wash i noticed so much change in the texture of my hair and my hair fall, breakage has decreased significantly. My hair feels thicker now it works just as minoxidil does but in using this shampoo you don&#x27;t have to go through a lot of hassle. I would highly recommend this shampoo experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> I just started to use this product. It is absolutely the greatest shampoo for anyone troubling with hair loss problems. I lose much lesser hair than before when I comb my hair. I hope to see more obvious effects within the next few weeks and I have faith in this product.</li>
    <li> Great product that really works. Has a very pleasant smell considering other shampoos with Argan oil.</li>
    <li> I have been used to using Revita but many people have said that they changed the formula. after searching for a while, I came upon this bottle and found many good reviews on it. I don&#x27;t think it helps &amp;#34;regrowing&amp;#34; hair, but it definitely helps to slow or stop the hair falling.</li>
    <li> I ended up buying this product when I noticed that my hair was beginning to grow very slow. After only about two weeks of use I began to notice significant results, not only did my hair begin to grow faster but it also felt and looked AMAZING! I was always a bit worried when it came down to shampoo and all the chemicals that I was putting in my hair but with this product I feel very safe!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the hair loss, but I can give a review based on what I have seen. Thus far my hair just feels oh so soft, healthier, more alive, and well, just better. I will update my review in a couple of months, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I have tried very hard to grow my hairs.  Two month left, so far a couple hairs grow up.  I am still using it, and no final conclusion yet.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for several months now.Can&#x27;t believe how well it works. I originally purchased it for my son for his thinning hair and I grabbed it one day after I ran out of my other shampoo. Haven&#x27;t stopped using it since! It makes my hair look thicker and fuller without adding a rough brittle feel. It&#x27;s soft and manageable even without conditioner.Yeah, it&#x27;s pricey, but the bottle seems to last, even with 3 of us using it...plus it&#x27;s ORGANIC, Definitely will purchase this item regularly. Wish it was available on Subscribe and Save!</li>
    <li> This shampoo it is use it for my wife and they tell me it is great to have a great hair.</li>
    <li> I stock up on this shampoo! It smells great and leaves my husbands and my hair feeling great. It&#x27;s a great product for the price and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I had used this product for about a year with no problems when I got my latest bottle.  I noticed right away that the pump was different as was the label.  When the shampoo came out it was thinner than the other bottle I still had a little left of and it smelled like plastic instead of the fresh scent from before.  After using the new shampoo once I noticed my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean.  I gave it a week.  At the end of the week I had a gross build-up on my scalp.  I checked out the ingredients and it is all different compared to the last (good) bottle.  Beware, if you&#x27;ve used this before...they messed up something and it is no longer good.  Today I threw my bottle, which was over 80% full, in the trash.  This is not the pura d&#x27;or shampoo...it is something else now.</li>
    <li> I am a 36 yr old male who had to stop taking Propecia due to lingering side effects that I couldn&#x27;t shake. I am left on my own to block DHT via natural methods instead of medication. After hours of online searching, I was led to this shampoo and bought my first bottle last week. As others have stated, it&#x27;s too soon to tell if/how it is working BUT after reading all of the reviews, I had to give it a shot. Agree with other posters that all you need is a very small amount to build up a full thick soapy lather and it leaves you feeling clean and hopefully over time, with less hair in the drain and more on your head!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! He says a little goes a long way. He would recommend this product because it does help stimulate hair growth.</li>
    <li> I lost a ton of my long hair after the birth of my first child. I ended up cutting my hair so short bc it just looked so shabby and needed volume. After the birth of my second child I decided to use this shampoo and conditioner as a prevention. Been using the product for a month and my hair is so voluminous! It&#x27;s thicker than ever and seems to be growing fast. I will update later at six months postpartum to see if I was able to avoid the hair loss!  UPDATE I still had hair loss at 5 months post partum through about now which is 6 months post partum. I can say that it was less than with my first child when I didn&#x27;t use this shampoo. I will keep using it Bc I think it works. It&#x27;s just not stronger than hormones. Ha ha</li>
    <li> This product appears to do what it says.  The only downside is it dries out my hair.  Buy some conditioner to use with it and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> So my family is one of those that just creates bald men. And that&#x27;s ok. But it&#x27;s not like I had a choice in the matter!!! Haha. So I noticed my hair getting thinner when it is grown out some and I&#x27;m only 23! What is that about? So I decided to try some hair remedies. My conclusion was that since my scalp is really dry and I have a tendency of dandruff, that&#x27;s probably what is causing the hair loss. So on top of needing a shampoo to help my hair loss, I also needed it to moisturize and help the dandruff! Well I found the dynamic duo with this shampoo. My scalp feels better overall and I&#x27;ve noticed a healthier thickness since I started using this. I would recommend to someone who is in need!</li>
    <li> I like the Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Shampoo.  I really didn&#x27;t have very high expectations.  I have been losing my hair slowly for over 10 years and did not expect it to stop by using a shampoo.  I read some positive reviews and figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try and wasn&#x27;t too costly or time consuming.  After using it for about a month, I have to say my hair is noticeably thicker.  I also notice less hair after showering.  My wife even noticed that my hair is thicker and stronger than before.  While it may not work for everyone, it seems to work for some, and definitely for me.  It product has a pleasant odor and lathers up nicely.  The bottle seems like it will last a long time too.  So I give it 5 stars because it is working nicely for me.  I can&#x27;t guarantee it will work for you, but I think at this price if you are losing your hair it is definitely worth trying this product to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> I can see and feel the difference between this and regular shampoo. My hair looks healthier and thicker. It&#x27;s not an over night miracle shampoo, but great results so far. I would let it sit on your head for at least 5 minutes for more hair and scalp absorption.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has lasted me a long time.  My hair seems to be thicker.  Its nice not having to use harsh chemicals on your hair that other shampoos use. The argan oil gives you a good shine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over six months now and bought three bottles for my parents. We like them a lot for several reasons. 1. dandruff is gone. 2. hair is healthier and stronger. I would recommend this product to those who have problem with hair loss and want their hair to grow more and stronger. I&#x27;ve bought a few more for my dad&#x27;s friends and myself.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding shampoo with literally immediate results. After one use my hair did feel thicker and had much more body. It took a curl better than ever before. Now that I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for a few weeks I can see and feel that my hair is stronger and healthier. I have also started to notice far less fall out which I struggle with due to thyroid issues. I will continue to purchase this shampoo and add in other products in the line. My one and only complaint is that the bottle mentions that it is a 3 month supply. My hair is just past shoulder length and not terribly thick and even washing only every other or third day this will not last me close to 3 months. But that&#x27;s a small complaint for a product that actually does what it promises.</li>
    <li> After 20 years of going to a local barber my friend finally convinced me to head to a real stylist. After my haircut the stylist (to my horror) told me that my hair is thinning very badly.... partly due to hereditary traits and partly due to the crappy shampoo i&#x27;ve been using all my life. Decided to give this one a try because it was actually recommended by the stylist. Makes hair feel fuller and easier to style... also feels far more healthy. I&#x27;ve only started using it but considering the full head of hair my stylist is rocking (he used to be thinning too), i think i&#x27;m in good hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also did some research on the quality of ingredients... and gotta say... ingredients used in this shampoo are LEGIT!!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the fact that the product does not have any harsh chemicals.  Most of the shampoos on the market even the name brand shampoos have harsh chemicals and strip your hair while it cleans.  Not sure it prevents hair loss but I keep buying it know that it leaves my hair clean without having to resort to unwanted chemicals</li>
    <li> A+ love love love the product it has halted my hair loss a must own for anyone with hair loss</li>
    <li> Been using this for  about 3 weeks. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. It&#x27;s a good high quality shampoo, but the jury is still out on the hair loss claims.</li>
    <li> after one week of used i feel my hair got stronger,will continue to using it. excellent product.also will order more of it.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT BUT HAIR FEELS DRY SOMETIMES.</li>
    <li> After first wash, less hair fell out</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a year, I definitely have notice that my hair is not falling out as much. This product works great, I will not use any other shampoo. This shampoo works and I combine it with the conditioner as well. Great product.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this product. I didn&#x27;t think it would really make any difference but it was inexpensive and  i needed to try something else. My hair has been thinning in recent years, and I was getting tired of the bright monkey butt growing on the crown of my head. I&#x27;ve used other shampoo products, and I did like the way they left my head with a clean tingly feeling, but honestly I had never seen any real dramatic improvements, and the spot just kept growing. Enter Pura d&#x27;or, I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or for about 2 weeks now, and I am really starting to see some results, far more than what I had expected. I can rub the crown of my head, and feel hair, not skin anymore. It is astonishing to me that in these last two weeks such a change has happened. Reading some of the other reviews, I have also experienced dryness from using this shampoo. It just didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft, but pretty dry and brittle. So I took another posters advice and stacked it with another shampoo, just a small amount from both and that dryness has pretty much gone away. I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend people to at least give it a try.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak of the performance of the shampoo regarding preventing hair loss or new growth since I only began using it. However, it lathers very well while using a small amount. You do notice the smell of the tea tree oil but it is not overwhelming. I&#x27;ll update the review when I  use the product for a few months.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product. Noticed results quickly without any complaints. I personally love the fragrance and notice a much cleaner feel and smoother sheen/ feel since using. I would highly recommend  again.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using the product for almost half a year.  it is long enough to write a  review.  Till now I didn’t see much difference in my hair. Although it didn’t prevent my hair loss, I feel it works for reducing the speed of my hair loss. on the other side  It  makes my hair  dry and frizzy.  since it is claimed as organic, I’ll continue to use it to see what will happen in the next half year.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dry/itchy/flaky/red unhealthy scalp for years.  Tried all dandruff shampoos, nothing seemed to work.  This is a gentle cleanser that has left my scalp feeling moist and healthy.  Does it prevent hair loss, that&#x27;s questionable....  The way I see it the only thing you can do to prevent hair loss is create a healthy scalp environment for the hair to grow on, and I feel this product achieves that.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any miracles yet but I  haven&#x27;t had this product that long. Smells and feels quite natural though.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I&#x27;ve learned to use VERY little shampoo lately. If I use to much my hair gets oily looking after about a day. I like to wash my hair every 2 days. I use this shampoo and Pantene aqua light conditioner. This shampoo does have a not so great scent when using it BUT when your hair dries, it actually smells very nice. I don&#x27;t get that though. It stinks when using it, but after it dries it has a whole different scent. I know since using this, I have able to go longer without washing my hair and it grow just a tad bit faster. ( I&#x27;m growing out a super short cut)</li>
    <li> After years of using un-organic/natural shampoo, I recently switched to organic/natural shampoo.  I bought this one because it is the best sell.  One review said that because it has argan oil, no need to use conditioner.  Unfortunately, it first does not lather well and make washing difficult and had to use more amount of shampoo each time.  What bothers me the most is that it makes my hair very coarse/rough/dry.  Conditioner turns out to be a must and need lots to soften my hair.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I have been using it for just a week and have found it to be very helpful with my hair loss by helping it grow back a little.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I&#x27;m a 38 year old male. I started using it about 7 - 8 months ago when I noticed my hair was thinning towards the front. Since using the shampoo, I have not noticed anymore thinning/receding. I believe it has helped to stop or slow the process of my hairline receding.</li>
    <li> My bottle came in the mail today and it is a 1/4 empty :(</li>
    <li> Use this product daily and have already noticed silky, smooth hair.  The texture of my hair seems somewhat improved and it is easier to style.  It will take more time to see if the volume improves and hair loss decreases.  I have used other shampoos with Fo Ti as an ingredient and have been incredibly impressed so I was happy to see that as an ingredient in this product as well.  The pump does seem a little slow in springing back but maybe it helps limit to one pump which is probably all you would need as it lathers better than other shampoos I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Noticeable effects only after a couple of uses.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> When I finally got to use this product, I found my hair to feel stronger, more manageable and thicker. The ingredients are not smelly,which I prefer and gives me a really clean shampoo, thank you so much.[[ASIN:B0079R6BD2 Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, Brown and Blue, 16 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> ncie smell, and very comfortable after use it. hair seems to grow a little bit</li>
    <li> The shampoo seems to be working so far, however I am also taking Biotin so not sure which is more effective. However the pump does not work and I have not been able to &#x27;pull it out&#x27; inspite of trying countless times so have to conclude its defective. It is very inconvenient to open the bottle and pour it out instead of using the pump and wish I could get a replacement pump.</li>
    <li> since I used it, I stopped losing hair</li>
    <li> Actually, it does not work to me</li>
    <li> All in all, I do like this product. It has helped slightly with slowing down hair loss, which is the main goal of using it. It is not a miracle cure, but it works pretty well. The smell is a bit odd, adding more green tea would make it smell less like coffee or something. But, it does not linger in your hair for any time. Overall, I enjoy the product and plan on using it for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 15 days now and I already notice less hairfall. The only thing thats worrying me is that its making my hair a bit dry. But there is definitely some reduction in hair fall</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo but I didn&#x27;t see drastic changes as far as hair loss goes. I believe it did help with slowing down hair loss but as far as regrowing or fully stopping I can&#x27;t say it completely worked for me. It smells great, has great ingredients and as an overall shampoo to slow hair loss it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Love this product. This shampoo is not like any product I&#x27;ve used, it cleans really well and rinse easily.  Time will only tell if the hair will grow back</li>
    <li> I really was thinking I would give this a one star, as the only reason I bought it was to help prevent hair loss and it did not do that at all.  It worked as a regular shampoo, but I can get a regular organic shampoo at my local Sprouts for half the price. However I am giving it a two because my hair did look shiny while using this. Sometimes organic can dry my hair out and this did not do that.  So, I would say if you were looking for a regular shampoo, this would probably fit the bill.  If you are looking for hair loss prevention- I might suggest you try a different avenue.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for around 7 weeks. Although I do not notice any new hair growth, I do notice that my hair is shedding a lot less than it was! I&#x27;m also using other treatments for hair loss so i can&#x27;t say for sure if it is the shampoo, but I am pleased that I&#x27;m not losing so much hair. This shampoo has a nice lather, which I was not expecting since most organic shampoos that have no sulfates do not lather well. It has a pleasant almost neutral smell, so I use a conditioner with a more floral scent afterwards. All in all, I like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used it now for 2 weeks. So far its working well for me. I definitely have way more volume than before I started using it. So I would buy it again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days, and I know I should wait a few weeks before writing a review of how good it is, but I love how the shampoo smells and leaves my hair very soft and clean, rather than rough and brittle. I feel like when I get out of the shower and comb by hair, I have been loosing less hair than prior to use.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a significant slowing in my hair loss. I have even received comments about how my hair looks thicker.  I&#x27;ve used this product for two years and will continue to do so.  I am very pleased with my results to this point.</li>
    <li> The pump got clogged up pretty quickly - the shampoo for some reason turned into a thick, sap-like consistently around the tube.  But that was a minor issue.  I didn&#x27;t really notice it making a difference in terms of hair loss.  It does seem to help prevent my scalp from getting oily, so that I can skip a day or two of washing my hair.  For the same reason, it dries out my hair and I definitely need to use lots of conditioner when I use it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair loss. Hair looks frizzy too.</li>
    <li> After using it for just one day, the amount of hair I was shedding in the shower was nearly cut in half.</li>
    <li> Used for over a week. Made my hair thinner, I didn&#x27;t see any reduction in hair fall so far. Made my scalp a bit oily with pimples.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for month now and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement, actually, it seems like I&#x27;ve lost more hair. I&#x27;ve had subscribed to it and received another one which I haven&#x27;t even taken out of the box yet. If I don&#x27;t start to see improvements I have no idea what to do with the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also make my hair extra dry and makes it look awful...</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I really like the scent of this shampoo and have both noticed that it seems to help with hair retention.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I myself use the product as well as my husband and my two kids. Since using this product I have seen great results, and I will continue to use this product. I have recommended this product to my friends and family members and they have also purchased the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic shampoo.</li>
    <li> Recently I do received this shampoo and used it right away. Smells not strong. I like it and definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product so far.    After about 10 washes my hair feels fuller, not as thin feeling as with other shampoos. I guess time will tell. I was a bit concerned about any offensive odor but it has a fresh scent almost unscented. Will follow up my review in a few months.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 4 or 5 stars, but over the last few years they&#x27;ve been tinkering with the ingredients in this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially used their gray-away blend (discontinued, although the ingredients were identical to the hair-loss prevention blend). It was the best shampoo I&#x27;d ever used, preventing the itchiness of my dandruff with tea tree oil and leaving my hair silky-smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I bought it, no tea tree oil. But it still left my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then they discontinued gray-away, and I went with this one. Now my hair is back to being unmanageable, and it does nothing to control the itchiness (I&#x27;ll have to intermittently use my anti-dandruff shampoo now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to continue using this product after my next order, but if they continue stripping down the benefits of using it I&#x27;ll have to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this a few times and am happy with the shampoo. It contains all the ingredients that I have read about pertaining to hair loss prevention with no harmful chemicals. However, I wish it contained catalase for gray hair prevention. Pura d&#x27;or sells one for gray hair that is very similar to this except for the addition of catalase. Most who have hair loss have gray hair also and it would be nice to not have to choose between the two products.  I also wish the company would make a hair styling gel with the hair loss prevention ingredients (as well as catalase) because leaving it on the scalp instead of washing it off is more effective. I used to use a hair gel with saw palmetto etc. that has since been discontinued. It was inexpensive but highly effective. More so than a shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I&#x27;ll be back for more because it works for me. I have noticed a significant reduction in hair loss since I started using this product. (I don&#x27;t have any bald spots, so I can&#x27;t say if the shampoo would have any effect in those areas.) I use 2 pumps per washing: one for the sides and the other for the front and back. (I have shoulder length hair, so you can judge for yourself how much you are likely to use.) I massage it in for about 1 minute and then let it sit for about a minute or two before rinsing. (Instructions say you should leave it on for 2 minutes prior to rinsing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it to be economical as the 16 oz. bottle has lasted 10 months (That&#x27;s 2 pumps per shampoo with 3 washings per week.) In addition, it&#x27;s organic, free of parabens and sulfates, not tested on animals, AND made in the US! I also like that it is not a sweet, perfumy smelling product. It has more of a natural herbal scent. If sweet smelling shampoos are what you prefer, this is not the shampoo for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to give one criticism, it wiould be that it stings when it gets in the eyes. But then, almost every shampoo does that. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and am glad that I found it. Hope this review will be helpful to you in determining if you should give it a try.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It has slowed down my hair loss so much. It is not heavy and leaves my hair feeling very light and clean.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, works wonders with my hair.</li>
    <li> Initially helped a lot. Now helps some with hair loss. Low suds. Leaves hair manageable. Pleasant smell. Will continue to use but may alternate with another shampoo as it is pricey.</li>
    <li> Only gad product for 1 week and hair is somewhat thicker.  I have taken a small amount not shampooing and left it in my hair for about and hour then rinse</li>
    <li> The shampoo does not leave my hair oily and gives nice volume. The smell is also pleasant and i have noticed reduced hair fall after each wash. I also feel confident using it regularly. I would buy this product again for sure.</li>
    <li> Have used it for a week. So far, I like it a lot. The fragrance is very neutral, which I like&lt;br /&gt;Will update after a months use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a week and I love it,  I love the fragrance and it lethers really well.  Just only with a few washes I&#x27;ve notice that I don&#x27;t have as much hairs on the shower drain as before.  I truly recomment this shampoo to anyone out there who is having hair loss problem.</li>
    <li> This is the item that I was looking forward to use!!&lt;br /&gt;best item ever for those of you who have less hair!</li>
    <li> Plain and simple: my hair looks and feels better and thicker when using this product. I am a guy with thinner hair, but this product has helped to create the body and texture I need to look good. In fact, I get compliments on how nice my hair looks...it isn&#x27;t dry or lacks body like some other shampoos strip your hair of, but doesn&#x27;t provide a waxy/oily body either - it is just perfect. Be sure to let it sit for at least 20-30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;When I am away from home and don&#x27;t use this product for a couple days, I can notice my hair quality degrading.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my 3rd bottle and won&#x27;t stop ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to help prevent hair loss. I am also using minoxidil.  My hair does feel much fuller after 3-4 months of use.</li>
    <li> So far i am loving this product. I have used it for 3 weeks, every day. I have noticed not as much hair loss. Must use conditioner though. Is not oily nor filled with heavy perfumes. It lathers suprisingly well with just one pump. I do leave it on a full 2 minutes before rinsing and applying conditioner.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Started using this product when I noticed my hair was thinning towards the front and I have been happy ever since! Product is great, lasts, and the smell isn&#x27;t overbearing unlike many other shampoos and conditioners. I would strongly recommend this product if you want to keep your hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now instead of the Nioxin brand I was using previously.  This shampoo feels so much healthier and more natural.  Nioxin always seemed harsh and chemically whereas the Pura d&#x27;or smells natural, feels natural and gives my hair a softness I didn&#x27;t get with similar shampoos.  I recommend this product to anyone with thin or thinning hair.  I don&#x27;t know that it actually regrows hair, but it seems to preserve what you do have and keeps it in good shape.</li>
    <li> I like the smell so much!!! And it feel like no chemical stuffs inside!! Strongly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since December 2012 and I’m still using it.  Although it doesn’t stop hair loss it definitely seems to minimize it.  I have a strainer over my shower drain and noticed far fewer hairs trapped on the strainer after using this product for about a month.  Results continued to improve for three to four months then leveled off.  Currently I use it with Alpecin caffeine shampoo and the combination yields the best results with loss down to a few hairs with each shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used this product for nearly two years I can state the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It does lessen hair loss with continued use.  Positive results should be noticed within a month and the full benefit within three months.&lt;br /&gt;2) My hair feels and looks fuller and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;3) Continued use and leaving on for at least two minutes before rinsing is critical for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;4) It doesn’t completely stop hair loss and won’t regrow hair from dormant follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four instead of five stars because I believe the claim of preventing premature hair loss is a bit of an exaggeration.  It does minimize loss and will improve the appearance of your hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great, helping prevent the handfuls of hair that were falling out before starting on this. It leaves hair feeling clean &amp; healthy. The only drawback is the scent is somewhat unappealing, but the conditioner more than makes up for it (lavender &amp; vanilla, yummy!).</li>
    <li> I wash my hair it was kind of silky and I like the texture of the shampoo and smell yes I would like to try the shampoo again</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks.. It washes out easily and I have noticed a significant reduction in Hair Loss.. I would definitely recommend this product and plan to buy more..</li>
    <li> looks very good, but I just tried once.</li>
    <li> nice product and came as desribed in ad - would buy again.</li>
    <li> Recently ordered it. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know about the results. But like it already. Keeping my fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> Within a week and a half of using this product I have experienced a tremendous shed of my hair. This product has reversed what I have spent months with Rogaine doing: growing back hairs that I have lost. Now, within a few weeks I have probably lost what I gained back over the course of 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product properly and only used it every other day. I liked the way the shampoo washed out and how it left no residue. I felt no difference in my hair thickness or sheen using this product, though. I suppose that is left to my conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very unhappy about this product. I have been off it for a week and hopefully the shedding will subside after going back to my old shampoo.</li>
    <li> Ok so my co-worker who is supper picky just as am I recommended this to me when I said my hair seems to be shedding way too much. I didn&#x27;t think it would work but hey, it&#x27;s worth a try right?!?! Ok so, from the first time I used it I saw a HUGE difference in the amount I shed. My hair is only to my shoulders so I shouldn&#x27;t shed so much but I would wake up and my pillow would be covered in hair. It&#x27;s been a few weeks not and I can actually skip about 1-2 days and not wash my hair and there is no hair on my pillow and almost no hair when I wash my hair. So here is what I do...I wash my hair with my regular shampoo and then I use a little bit of this stuff. I am amazed and LOVE it!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> I got the shampoo and really like it. Reversing DHT and minutarizing process of hair takes sometime and like with any product topical or oral needs to be used consistently for 6 months-1 yr. the shampoo is again varying in result to your body type and severity of hair loss. The conditioner is a waste of money and can be avoided. Go for a keratin and biotin infused conditioner instead</li>
    <li> It worked great and prevented my hair loss to a great extent. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I started using this after I lost a lot of hair.  My hair is fine and thin and nothing would help it from falling.  I use this all the time and am glad I found such a great product.  I recommend the product to everyone, even men.  I didn&#x27;t want to take any medications and this was very helpful!</li>
    <li> I had tried this about a month, and it works really well. Def. gonna keep buying!</li>
    <li> This product has produced a noticeable difference in hair retention and thickness. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. My hair looks more healthy and strong. The fragrance very natural , smell like herbs, that I liked. Was curious Next bottle I took the same brand but with gold label, called Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo. I was curious  if it is as good as with blue label.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  Leaves your hair silky smooth and makes your scalp feel wonderful! I plan on using this for a very long time! Fast shipping! Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 years now, and it really works on me. My hair got thicker and stopped falling. I relocated recently and have been using my wife&#x27;s shampoo for the last three weeks ... and my hair started thinning again. Just ordered a new supply of Pura D&#x27;Or !&lt;br /&gt;The product is also very efficient. Just a small amount is enough to wash your hair each time. Each bottle lasts a long time - at least 4 months each (16 fl Oz).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing some hair loss on the top of my scalp.  In addition, my skin is sensitive and my scalp looks red and irritated. I chose this shampoo because it is organic and I found my skin reacts better to natural ingredients rather than harsh chemicals.  The shampoo has a nice clean smell and I like that it is one step, rather than Nioxin that has 3 steps.  This shampoo is also a lot cheaper and lasts longer than Nioxin.  While I haven&#x27;t seen re-growth of hair yet, my scalp looks better and my hair feels and looks healthier and fuller.  I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. I love how soft my hair feels after I get out of the shower after using the shampoo. This product is reasonably priced as well.</li>
    <li> My hair is nice and soft</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing anything</li>
    <li> Seems to be working, so far.  Makes my hair soft and feels thicker.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t attest to whether the hair loss prevention claims are true, but I really like this shampoo.</li>
    <li> First tie trying lathered up real good, may have used too much.  Instructions are very small read before shower leave in 2 min.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsed out and felt real clean my wife noticed the difference after only one use.  Plan to keep using and update any new discoveries.</li>
    <li> Shampoo smells great. It is easy to rinse off leaving a fresh and clean feeling after wash.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for several months and it did not work for me. I hope others have better luck but as for me my hair is still falling out.</li>
    <li> Does not really prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised to do. PREVENT hair loss. This is NOT a miracle hair regrowth shampoo, however it will control whatever hair loss that has already happened. Leaves my hair feeling smooth, no residue. Excellent product which I have been using over the year and have noticed significant decrease in the amount hair fall in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be alarmed that nothing is happening after a couple days use. You will start to see noticeable drop in hair loss after approximately 2-3 months of continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY shampoo I will ever use. Also its made right here in the good ol&#x27; US of A and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ever love any shampoo, but this turned out to be the exception to that rule.  First of all, my hair felt so silky soft after a few washes with it and continues to feel that way so I know there is no build up happening.  And after a month of using it, my hair feels a bit fuller.  Full disclosure, I am pregnant as well, but I am hoping that this shampoo helps me with the sudden postpartum hair loss that I always suffer from.  It is a little pricey, but the ingredients are high quality.  I tend to leave it on my hair for a few minutes to let the oil soak into my hair.  I didn&#x27;t love the conditioner that matches this, so I just use different conditioners, mostly Giovanni.</li>
    <li> this product smells great, lathers well, and feels refreshing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 32 year old woman and started noticing hair loss about a year ago.  I began researching good hair loss prevention products and found this one recommended and review well on different sites.  I also started taking Biotin and using a regrowth conditioner.  Although I&#x27;m still losing hair I feel that it has started falling out less and still seems full.  It is hard to determine which product may have prevented additional loss.  This product seems high quality and has a fresh almost minty smell.  Although it doesnt seem to add any smell goody quality to my hair when dry its nice when lathering in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good... I use this so I can grow my hair thicker because it&#x27;s kinda thinning... due to hair loss. I also take coconut oil supplement and they work for me.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working alright notice less hair loss with it&#x27;s use</li>
    <li> The shampoo is very nice and has great ingredients. It leaves my hair looking and feeling great. The only thing I wish was better about it would be that I would like it to &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; up a little bit more than it does. I will, however, purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> My hair can thin when under a lot of stress. This can also happen with years of using cheap shampoo (It&#x27;s the sodium laurel sulfates). I have been using this shampoo for about 6 months now and can really tell that my hair is thickening again. l&#x27;m no longer embarrassed by a pitiful ponytail, and it looks thicker when I wear it down. When paired with the Lavender/Vanilla Conditioner, it&#x27;s a relaxing, spa-type experience. I highly recommend this if your hair is thinning and you would like to try something new.</li>
    <li> Would not waste my money on this product again.</li>
    <li> This is my forth bottle of premium organic shampoo  and I no longer have an itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo every time I wash my hair. I rub pure argan oil into my scalp before bed, wrap it and then wash it in the morning. My hair has never looked so good and it seems to be much healthier, though it&#x27;s impossible to tell if it&#x27;s only the shampoo, as it&#x27;s not the only thing I&#x27;m doing. Still, I would recommend it without reservation. I&#x27;m planning to try the gold label next. Great products!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell. Luxurious lather. Too early to tell how effective it is in hair loss prevention, but I appreciate the all-natural, organic nature of the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pura D&#x27;or Oil organic shampoo now for a month and have noticed an appreciable improvement in the volume of my thinning hair. The product is VERY concentrated so you only need a very small amount with each application. I started using three times a week but have now moved to daily and eliminated the other shampoos. Very happy with this product so far.</li>
    <li> Smells very good, I am liking the way my hair feels, I know I&#x27;ll have to wait to see results but so far I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 1 year and I have noticed a remarkable improvement in the amount of hair and the healthiness of my hair.  I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> We bought this shampoo for my husband and he loves it. We just ordered our second bottle...the first lasted for months...9 maybe? So, although a steep price, it lasts long enough to make it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between this shampoo and rogaine, we have seen his hairline stop receding and actually fill out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Used Pura d&#x27;or today for the first time, Lathers great and smells amazing. Also left my hair feeling very clean and soft. In a few days I should be able to see less hair falling off.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo, it smells good</li>
    <li> smells great, is much kinder to the scalp and hair than other shampoos like bosley.  Will definitely buy again.  Too soon to notice overall hair thickening but hair feels healthier almost instantly.</li>
    <li> This is the fastest-working anti hair-loss shampoo I&#x27;ve used to date. I have used brands from CVS (Biota) as well as Rogaine brand shampoo. My hair stops falling out within a week of use. Combined with a Minoxidil treatment, I am able to regrow hair and maintain a full head of hair consistently. My favorite thing about this shampoo is how &amp;#34;sudsy&amp;#34; it is. Two pumps is all I need to fully lather my entire head of hair; this makes the product last longer than other brands I tried. Also, the product smells great (minty and herbal) and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle now of Pura d&#x27;or after switching from Nioxin.  This shampoo is great and I like the fact it contains natural ingredients and no sodium lauryl sulfate.  I do not need to use a condioner with this shampoo and it seems the argan oil in it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it for very long but this the shampoo does leave my hair clean, and scalp feeling great.</li>
    <li> A little expensive, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo for about one year and It works for me.</li>
    <li> At first I had to use more product to get enough foam to cleanse throughly. After shampooing my hair was very soft. I have really lifted this product within two days of use my hair is naturally fuller and soft at the same time. I definitely feel more volume!! So far an A++</li>
    <li> As the best seller among the similar products, this product was recommended to me by one friend who has the similar problem as I do - continuously losing hair in a large amount. I just recently purchased and have used it for a few times. For the first a few times when I applied it, my scalp feels itchy, not sure why but it is getting better. I can slightly feel that my hair loss is getting better too after each bath. I never had a faith in shampoo curing hair loss but I guess I will continuously use this product at least for a few months to see what&#x27;s miracle going to happen and keep you guys updated!</li>
    <li> It definitely helps increasing volume. My hair is less greasy than before after using this product.</li>
    <li> I have used about 2 bottles of this so far and it is by far the only shampoo that has worked to stop my hair loss. I no longer see hair loss after washing my hair and the areas that seemed sparse near my hair line have filled in. This shampoo also leaves my hair fuller, shiner, and cleaner. I have received tons of compliments since I started using it. I highly recommend it to anyone experiencing hair loss and or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I definitely saw less hair falling out. Smells good!</li>
    <li> Purchased for a family member. The family member insist that it really does help with preventing hair loss. Also, it doesn&#x27;t itch the scalp and it smells good and fresh. The family member enjoys it so I always have to purchase more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different hair loss shampoos and this one is the best so far. My hair loss has stopped completely and it also makes my hair feel/look fuller. This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve gone back to buy again.</li>
    <li> Two days after I bought it, it is on my front door. The packaging is good and the product is in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a month. Everything looks good so far. My hair does become less oily. I&#x27;m not sure if I have less hair dropping everyday, but it certainly does not worsen the situation in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product and it is offered at a very good price here.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo. Gives volume to my limping hair and shows a bit of growth after 1 month of daily use.</li>
    <li> Really Good Shampoo That Leaves Your Hair Feeling Full And Thicker But Smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Presently I Just Began Using This Shampoo And So Far I Am Throughly Satisfied With The Results.</li>
    <li> Seems to work as advertised in the 1+ years I&#x27;ve been using this.  A few years ago I had thinning hair on my left side which appears to have stabilized (although I still feel like the hair on my right side is fuller).  My wife used this shampoo for a few months and she had more pronounced general hair loss prior to using the shampoo,  she claims it has stopped her hair loss but she has stopped using it because it dries out her hair.  I would agree that it tends to dry our your hair but it still use it daily.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband, he has been using other products for two years but didnt seem grow his hair much. we hear this product from friends Nd website, thought we should give it a try. He likes it so far, seems really works and thinking of keep using it for long run.Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and leaves my hair clean and feeling fresh. I have been only using it for a few days so I can&#x27;t honestly say if it helps with the hair loss but I am optimistic!</li>
    <li> Like it, not a fan of the flavor but still love the product. Recommended this to my friend and she also loved it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for great organic hair loss shampoo for a long time and found this fabulous product and great reviews here.&lt;br /&gt; It has been 5 days after I receive this products. I have noticed not as much hair loss already. O course it has been only 5 days so I will definitely keep using this shampoo for sure. I cannot wait to see the great result from 6 month - 12month from now!</li>
    <li> This is my first shampoo for hair loss prevention and I already like it for how good it is. I am planning to keep using it and see even better results.</li>
    <li> After a week of use my hair stopped shedding (and believe me, it was a lot of hair that was falling). My brush is practically empty after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Really great product! Will definetly keep buying, trying to keep my hair healthy and it helps!</li>
    <li> Really like it so far! Only been a few weeks but i definitely notice my hair looks and feels thicker and cleaner.  My scalp doesn&#x27;t feel as dry.  I&#x27;m happy I accidentally ordered two bottles.</li>
    <li> Powerful cleanning after washing. Have not use it for a very long time, but for now, I like the smell and feeling for this product. Hope it can work well for hair loss too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually pretty amazed. I had been using many different products over the years, but namely Axe shampoo and their conditioner as well. When that ran out, I switched to head and shoulders. There is some history of hair loss in my family, so that&#x27;s always been something I&#x27;ve had to look out for. Within about a month of using the Head and Shoulders, a lot of hair would be on my hands after drying my head. I could physically take my hand, brush it through my hair, and hair would continuously fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that to some extent that is normal, however it was much more than I was ever used to. Given that, I did a little bit of research. This was the top rated product in the category and the price was better than some of the other highly rated products so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within two days of using it, I no longer have much hair on my hands or towel after a shower. I can also vigorously brush my hand through my hair and will get minimum hairs falling out. Hardly scientific, but a significant improvement by any measurement. This stuff isn&#x27;t the cheapest, but you only need to use about half a pump to get the job done. I find that with big bottles of shampoo I tend to go through the first 3/4 much quicker than the last 1/4 because I waste so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe there are any shampoos that will effectively reverse hair loss, but you can slow it and I think this is a great approach to doing so.</li>
    <li> it is very good shanpoo, i feel my hair come back~</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time today, and it was great. It left my hair feeling wonderful. Will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> This product is so good, I buy it and, the shipping was very fast. In good presentation. Seal and packed. I like the smell. I used it and will continuous use it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommended.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best I have ever used. It leaves my scalp tingly and clean. My hair loss has practically stopped and I am already seeing more thickness after just a few weeks of using. I have recommended the shampoo to friends.</li>
    <li> My hair feels really clean after using it.  However, I haven&#x27;t used it as much just yet so I can&#x27;t really say anything regarding hair loss prevention.  I should be updating within a few weeks.</li>
    <li> When I saw the bottle, my first thought was that it was a small quantity considering the price.  But I found out to my surprise that it takes half the amount I normally need to wash my hair.  And what a difference in the way my hair felt - it felt fuller, shinier and healthier.  I knew then why it was costly.  You certainly get what you pay for - and this product was worth every penny</li>
    <li> I found this product extremely valuable. It made my hair smooth, frizz free and easy to style. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I feel my hair scalp very comfortable and very good product</li>
    <li> It works for me.  I have been using it once a day for two weeks and seen mush less hair loss already.</li>
    <li> My partner can&#x27;t use Rogaine (due to side effects), but swears this is the next best thing. He&#x27;s noticed less hair in the bathtub drain and generally healthier looking hair since we started using it over a year ago. I myself use it in addition to Rogaine and agree, this is the only shampoo we&#x27;ll buy from here on out. I appreciate that it has ingredients I understand, leaves my hair looking great, and has a pleasant, natural smell. The conditioner from this company is also top-notch.</li>
    <li> Awesomely effective. I want more!!</li>
    <li> Pure heaven - after two washes, my hair feels fuller and more alive. Very Happy with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I tried it today, I like the smell and the touch of my hair. I will buy it next time.</li>
    <li> My friend happened to give haft a bottle of this shampoo. I try and I love this product. It helps preventing my hair lost so well.</li>
    <li> Love all of the Pura d&#x27;or products - this one has made a noticeable difference in my hair.  Love the results!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My hair loss is dramatic. I have tried everything and was afraid nothing would work for my hair. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner combo for about 4 weeks. Does it stop hair loss? In the first month, I have noticed less hair falling down. It works quite well. If you are looking for a solution to help with losing hair problem, I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> As I have indicated in my review of hair vitamins, I am doing several things at once, so I don&#x27;t know what is responsible for improvement.  But my hair is better than it was.</li>
    <li> Used the product for 2 weeks. Will have to wait for my next haircut to see if the results.</li>
    <li> I have had this shampoo for approximately 3 months! And I must say I love it! Bottle last forever!!!! I still have a lot left!! And have seen major difference in my hair loss!! I now have baby hairs everywhere!! Love love love it! I highly recommend you try it!</li>
    <li> great product.....works great......conditions hair and scalp</li>
    <li> I have been bothered by the hair loss issues for years, and I doubted whether this product really works or not. After using it for several weeks, I think my hair loss is stopped, because before using this shampoo, each time after bath, I could see much hair in the bathtub. but after using this for several weeks, I could hardly find hair in the bathtub anymore. So, the answer to the claim: Continued use WILL prevent further hair loss &amp; Safe for ALL hair types, is yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is expensive than normal shampoos, and it seems that it cannot help you to increase your hair, it really effective to prevent further hair loss. So far I like it and strongly recommend my family and friends using it.</li>
    <li> After experiencing hairloss from taking B5 for acne, I started losing  A LOT of hair. After a lot of research I decided to try products that inhibit DHT. I started with nioxin which did make my hair feel thicker. While it does help, it contains ingredients I don&#x27;t feel great about putting on my scalp. I ordered this, thinking it would product similar results without the bad ingredients. After regular use (3-5 times a week) I feel that I have new growth. I am not sure that this is decreasing the amount of loss I am experiencing but my circumstances are different than most (look up the connection between high dose B5 and hairloss) Sad face.... I intend to keep using this product (with whatever condition I have on hand).</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  I have a gluten intolerance which not only effects my stomach, but my skin as well.  Before I started using this shampoo I would have to change shampoo&#x27;s once maybe twice a month to keep my scalp from itching.  With this shampoo I don&#x27;t itch and my scalp feels clean...no build up with this product.  I will admit the smell leaves something to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to many family members and friends.  For me there is no better shampoo out there.  Try it!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has stopped my hair loss significantly.  It gives my hair great texture as well.  I would recommend it for anyone who is thinning.</li>
    <li> got this item two weeks ago, feeling very good with it, using this very two days.</li>
    <li> This shampoo combined with the Pura d&#x27;or Conditioner makes my hair feel so healthy and full! I have very thin hair that used to fall out in very large amounts. My hair loss has improved 50% but has not stopped completely, however I have noticed increased hair growth esp on the front my head where I was experiencing a little balding near my hairline. Also, my hair is so much healthier and stronger. I wear my hair in a tight bun everyday which causes damage and dryness, after using this shampoo for 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve seen a big differenece in my hair! Would definitely recommend, however keep in mind that its going to have different results for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo smells great too!</li>
    <li> Recently I&#x27;ve been noticing more hair fall than normal. I&#x27;ve been searching for a thickening shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. This one works very well in that regard. It also smells very good. Much better than the Paul Mitchell Green Tea thickening stuff and my hair smells better too. I don&#x27;t know if it will solve my hair fall problems, but at least the rest of the hair will be nice.</li>
    <li> Great product. Started using it daily with noticeable improvement in volume and smoothness.</li>
    <li> I have used this for couple weeks but I am not sure if this product really works. It sometimes doesn&#x27;t help much &#x27;cause the same amount of hair is still falling but sometimes I find it reduces about 50-60% of hair falling out. I will give it a try to see how it works in the long run.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I was starting to experience some hair loss and it stopped it dead in its tracks.</li>
    <li> I must say, I don&#x27;t usually write product reviews, but this Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo is amazing. After only a couple weeks of using it, I feel that my hair is thicker. My girlfriend loves running her hands through my hair now. The shampoo also smells amazing. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends. 5 STARS!!!</li>
    <li> It works just like the anti-hair loss shampoo named &amp;#34;Zhui Feng&amp;#34; I bought from China and their odors are similar too. I was using &amp;#34;Zhui Feng&amp;#34; all the time before I started to use this product. This Pura d&#x27;or shampoo has the same function as &amp;#34;Zhui Feng&amp;#34; in that it did prevent me from losing a lot of hair everyday, and it is organic which is better than my Chinese shampoo. I finally find a shampoo that can satisfy my need in the US and I do not need to buy shampoos from China and ship them to the US any more! I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> oh my goodness! my hair has grown SO much since i started using this stuff!!! i am white but i have dyed my hair so many times and now I&#x27;m in a stage where i just want it to grow.  no more dye no more nothing.  this stuff is awesome! it has grown noticeably in the past two weeks of using.</li>
    <li> I think it is good at least for now. But the positive effect is not apparently for just half-month use. I will continue to use this one. For now I feel very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Just starting to use this, I can&#x27;t say anything yet about hair loss prevention. It seems to be a nice shampoo which I will use daily until gone. Perhaps I can then report on it&#x27;s hair loss effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Item arrived super fast and as described. Good natural shampoo, no annoying perfumes, gets hair squeeky clean! Would have given 5 stars except for the pump. It&#x27;s tricky to use in the shower and shampoos should just have a flip top that opens from the bottom. The shampoo itself is great and will most likely buy again.</li>
    <li> great product. I am able to see less hair felling down after using!</li>
    <li> One of the best sulfate free shampoos that makes my hair feels healthier and smooth after wash.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. This is the only product that I used that actually helped with my hair. and it is not too dry after I used it.</li>
    <li> Since I was in college, my hair issue begun to me. I have tried many products to solve this problem, but i failed. After someone recommend me this shampoo, it made my hair super clean feeling, bouncy and full of life and shine. I noticed less shedding after the first few uses. I have been using it for a week now and am very happy with the results. The company is wonderful as well. Very customer oriented and very resourceful when it comes to hair. I will continue to use this product and see how it does.</li>
    <li> it is very effective and i would definately recommend.</li>
    <li> After three weeks of use, I notice at least some change, although not significant yet. I used to have medium ball size hair loss after each wash, but for now I see a reduced ball size. This product cleans well, and I can feel that my hair is softer. I personally like the smell of essential oils.</li>
    <li> I just using this for about a 2 weeks hair feels and looks great but not yet sure about the hair loss yet to early to tell but so far so good</li>
    <li> wife love the shampoo</li>
    <li> It smells ok. And I can see my hair is more health after I use it for some days.</li>
    <li> It awesome. I noted the first time I use it. Left my hair with no residue, soft and had volume. I have been using it for a few weeks and will continue to see if shedding diminishes.</li>
    <li> Does not have too many artificial ingredients that eat up the scalp. Instead has ingredients that are natural and promote healthy scalp and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I have had some increased hair fall for first few days but then it reduced .&lt;br /&gt;The smell it gives to the hair is good and it lives on for more than a day such that i dont have to shampoo everyday, Rather i am able to get back to once in 2 days .&lt;br /&gt;The difference in the quality of the hair can be easily noticed after a week of usage.&lt;br /&gt;No itching on scalp or no red marks . I used to get it with other shampoos .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t give lot of volume to hair, but keeps hair together making it appear little lesser(or may be thats the real volume of the hair) .&lt;br /&gt;Have to use lot of shampoo while washing the hair, as it doesn&#x27;t give enough lather unless you use lot of shampoo(atleast more than what i used to use for other shampoos).&lt;br /&gt;When you oil your hair, you&#x27;d need more than that.&lt;br /&gt;Did not stop the hair fall but it reduced it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a little over two months.  What I can tell you is that my hair loss has improved and my hair seems thicker.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but it seems to dry my hair a little. I will continue using this shampoo and will be trying the conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> good shampoo，i bought it for my dad，he really like it，just recommed！</li>
    <li> I am a 62 year old woman who has very thin fine hair.  However, lately I have been under alot of stress and my already thin hair started falling and really bad with my scalp especially in the front showing.  Needless to say this made me even more stressful.  So, I went to Amazon.Com to view products that would stop hair loss and maybe even help my hair to grow back.  I came upon the reviews on Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo.  I was very impressed with that people who used this were saying about their results.  So, I ordered 2 bottles.  I have been using this shampoo daily for about 2 weeks. My hair has stopped falling and due to the volume increase in the shampoo my hair looks thicker and you don&#x27;t see my scalp anymore.  I am extremely happy with this shampoo and would recommend it especially to women who may be having the same problem as I had.  I will continue using this shampoo because it worked for me!! This is posted under my husband&#x27;s name.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. It lathers up really nicely, feels great and smells great. No irritation at all.</li>
    <li> Not an overnight cure - but after 2 weeks, my hair does feel healthier</li>
    <li> Made my hair dry and always attracted static which never did before. Did not see any changes as far as hair prevention goes either. I made charts and took photos regularly, before I took the shampoo and conditioner.. and after. NO Change. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Used it for about a year, did not see any improvements whatsoever in volume or hair growth. I have straight and a little oily hair, and it didn&#x27;t improve it at all other than make it clean. May work for some, definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 1 week. And I like it a lot. It really helps my hair loss. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference but I&#x27;ll keep trying. If it works I&#x27;ll change my review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks, and noticed less hair on the floor. I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product and continue using it.</li>
    <li> used it for only one week but feels good now, usually my clean hair will not last for more than one day after washed, it will look nasty immediately, but with this shampoo it can last for almost two days.&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo doesn&#x27;t have any weird sweet smell, which is good for me, and it seems like I didn&#x27;t lose so much hair as before.&lt;br /&gt;give 4 stars just because i only used it for one week and not very sure about the effect.</li>
    <li> I got the information of this kind of shampoo from my friend and Internet both, obviously it is highly regarded. I have recently bought one and began to use it, this is my second time to buy one, it seems good and I feel the hair loss situation for me is becoming less obvious.</li>
    <li> The shampoo definitely has benefits. My hair feels better after using it, but it&#x27;s an expensive shampoo to use everyday I think. For me, it&#x27;s not something I can afford to use on a daily basis. I use it just about every other day, and it definitely helps strengthen hair and the biotin gives your hair a better visual appearance in shine and volume as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotin definitely works better when ingested in tablet form. It can build up in your body which then promotes the hair growth and fullness associated with the supplement. The biggest change I&#x27;ve seen in actual hair growth has come from adding biotin in pill form ([[ASIN:B0026QPS4E Spring Valley - Biotin 5000 mcg, Super Potency, 120 Softgels]]) and a hair growth supplement; [[ASIN:B00MMA7W5C Hair Growth Essentials: #1 Rated Hair Loss Supplement for Women and Men - Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment With 29 Powerful Hair Growth Vitamins &amp; Nutrients for Rapid Growth - 20 Day Supply]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a month there was a noticeable change in the thick and fullness, as well as more rapid growth. Biotin alone gave me good improvement and then now that I use these all together, my friends have started asking me what I am doing with my hair!</li>
    <li> really like it,good smell. stop losing my hair</li>
    <li> I purchased my first bottle of Pura dor Argan oil Hair Loss Shampoo about two weeks ago and was so impressed with the great results that I just ordered my second bottle. I would highly recommend this shampoo to all my family and friends , a superior product. Rich Mangano - ramango17@aol.com</li>
    <li> The best organic shampoo in the market. I&#x27;ve used both the blue and gold label Pura D&#x27;or products now, and they are so far the best products I&#x27;ve used for my hair. I keep getting told by my friends and family in the last week that my hair is looking thicker and that is looks like its growing back! I finally found the solution to my hair loss. Im so excited im finally going to have a a thicker and fuller hair.</li>
    <li> As the first time I used, I think it is a little bit dry for my hair, but it&#x27;s gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to the effective.&lt;br /&gt;Hope help!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle ordered of this product and I will continue to use as my shampoo because it works!  I won&#x27;t be without this. My long hair was falling out in the shower and thinning. I did research and found this shampoo on Amazon to try. I have great results - hair loss slowed and soon stopped. My hair loss is over and hair is feeling thicker. The extra bonus is that all ingredients are natural and healthy. The argan oil adds great shine. My hairstylist even commented on how healthy my hair is looking and how fast it is growing. Love this and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve been getting older, my hair has been thinning. I&#x27;ve tired different products over the years and Pura d&#x27;or is the best organic shampoo for my hair. It really seems to be making a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really appreciate the plastic bottle and pump dispenser which works well in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had scalp problems for the past years and I&#x27;ve tried many products. This shampoo is 100% natural organic, free of chemicals. Since I have an active lifestyle, I take a shower everyday sometimes twice a day. The shampoo is soft enough to use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> After using it for one week, my hair condition is becoming better and better. It might be too short to give a judgement whether this shampoo helps to improve hair loss. But my hair does truly turn out to be more smooth. At first, I was hesitated since without using a conditioner, it may make my hair dry and fussy. But it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll continue to use this shampoo to see whether hair volume is growing.</li>
    <li> I love this product. it feels good and my hair starts to feel thick an smooth.</li>
    <li> Smell good and leave the hair feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. This organic shampoo stops hair loss and starts to regrow hair. Amazing product and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> First of all, prevents premature hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this since one year ago, it is different from the same product with gold labels. This one it is smelling better with nice scent. After one year usage, it prevents further the hair loss. My hairstyle is still M style. According to the fading theory, it is better than without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it adds volume to the head back. However, the front head still looks similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, The hair growth is faster. Before I used this product, I went to the barber once a month. Now for the same hair length, I have to go twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;volume not large enough. Usually one bottle of 16 oz only lasts for two months.&lt;br /&gt;bubbles not a lot. Not fun.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using for almost a year. I can&#x27;t say it helps hair growth; don&#x27;t see much new growth. Its just nice to have something without all the chemicals. BUT this most recent purchase appears to be a NEW FORMULA???. Its a different smell and more water consistency. Almost watered down? I don&#x27;t think this bottle has as much as the original material as it just seems like a less of a product than my first bottle in 2014.   OLD review: working well. Not as much hair in the drain. Can&#x27;t say hair growing back but definitely less loss which is good</li>
    <li> I do not usually write reviews on Amazon but this shampoo is amazing! I were losing my hair seriously these days and I have tried a lot of different shampoos. But all other shampoos just made the situation worse... Every time when I washed my hair using other shampoo, I noticed a lot of lost hair. But when I switched to this Loss prevention shampoo, I noticed the difference even the first time when I used it. My hair got stronger and do not easily fall. I even feel my hair grows quicker than before. Definitely recommend this shampoo! It will be better it comes with the corresponding conditioner of course.</li>
    <li> It feels great on hair. The herbal scent is amazing. I just got mine. Gonna keep posting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several days now, and I really like the shampoo. This is a creamy shampoo, but it feels very light and is rinsed out easily. I think that it leaves my hair clean - I follow up with Agadir brand volumizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant, but very light. It doesn&#x27;t linger. I think I read that people have a hard time getting it to lather - I don&#x27;t have that problem. I do find that organic or sulfate free shampoos have a slightly different texture than the typical brands, but lack of lather is not a problem I have with this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the hair loss prevention - I don&#x27;t know how long you have to use it to be able to attest to this claim. This morning I noticed the least amount of hair in the drain that I have in a long time. I was pretty excited about that, I hope I can attribute it to the shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like it - I just hope I continue to like it enough to pay this much for it. Although, Amazon does have it at the cheapest price I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
    <li> No need conditioner. I have no time for elaborate personal care. I just use shea butter for pretty much everything. So I looked for an all in one shampoo. And gladly this is one such shampoo. I&#x27;m particular about ingredients being all plant and natural without sod laureate. This thing did not have it. Try it.</li>
    <li> Used it 3 times made my scalp itchy, and hair falling out more! Not sure what&#x27;s up with this product.</li>
    <li> Less hair is falling out since I started using this shampoo. Shampoo does not lather and hair feels drier after shampooing.</li>
    <li> at the first week already slow down my hair loss. it&#x27;s good. but after shampoo my hair feel very dry.</li>
    <li> After using this product for two weeks, my hair gets much smoother and shiny. However, the hair loss is not prevented much. Maybe I need to use more.</li>
    <li> My mother and I have been using this for about more than a week thus far, and my mother immediately saw the difference between using this and another commericial brand shampoo product: This shampoo resulted with less hair loss after washing her hair with this. I love how this shampoo is organic, controls my frizzy hair, and the smell is absolutely amazing (it smells like lemons, real good). Will be continuously buying this product again. The only downside to this is the cost of it. Costs about 4x as much as a popular commercial brand product but I guess your paying for the quality of it and for the investment in keeping your hair for the future.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the best but I can definitely see an improvement in my hair. I don&#x27;t notice as much hair falling on the ground when I brush it or when I blowdry. I would recommend this product to people who really want to focus on having healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me, as a result got excess dandruff, skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;For that price it&#x27;s mere garbage</li>
    <li> Great shampoo after trying various products in the past. This leaves my hair feeling really nice.</li>
    <li> Since I began using Pura d or Argan Oil about 1 year ago, I&#x27;ve noticed in the past 6 months that I seem to be losing less hair in the shower and my thinning hair seems to show a little less scalp .</li>
    <li> I am using this product as a preventative measure for losing hair. It seems to have each of the components that are common in good hair loss prevention shampoos, including Saw Palmetto, which I believe is used as a natural DHT blocker. It is great that the product is all organic. The only reason for 4 stars is that it is a little expensive for the quantity.</li>
    <li> Very long lasting shampoo been using for months and still not a quarter used, I have short hair. Little thinning on the top of my head, girlfriend didn&#x27;t really noticed. Product doesn&#x27;t seem to help with hairloss much but I don&#x27;t know what my hair would be without it. Even for a shampoo to wash hair I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great, I kept losing my hair since I move to the U.S., I feel significant difference after I used this shampoo, and I could feel my hair become more shinny. I think I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> excellent shampoo for daily use...i was luking for a shampoo tht is free from harsh chemicals &amp; this one fits d bill perfectly.it cleanses completely without making my hair excessively dry.i also hope tht it&#x27;ll resolve the problem of hair fall with prolong use.i have sensitive scalp &amp; only few shampoos suits me.this shampoo is completely natural</li>
    <li> Smells wierd but good to use.</li>
    <li> I am male, 32. I purchases this after doing a lot of research. To be honest with you, i was very skeptical at first. However after using this between 2-3 weeks, I noticed a great decrease of the amount of my hair falling off after each shower. Overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This item makes my hair feel dry or stripped...which I&#x27;m sure is what it is supposed to do to get off the DHT.  But, followed by the conditioner my hair feels normal!  So far so good!!</li>
    <li> I am a lady from China, I used lost a lot of my hair in autumn when I wash my hair,since I use the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo two weeks , It seens less hair loss, I wiill contiuning use it waiting for miracle.</li>
    <li> Have used it for 2 weeks so far (once every 2 days).  Noticed more body with hairs and feels cleaner than ordinary shampoo.  Hair loss rate seemed to have reduced a bit but not sure if it&#x27;s wishful thinking...  Plan to continue with at least 1-2 more bottles before reaching more definite conclusion on hair loss.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s too soon to say something about the outcome, but I am happy that my hair texture is pretty amazing since I start using this product.</li>
    <li> Well, I have just used it for one week. I suffer from the hair loss a lot, and after using it, I have to say, it has effect in some degree. The hair loss is reduced a little. Also it makes my hair a bit dry, but it is more fine comparing with greasy.</li>
    <li> My goal was to get rid of all the harsh chemicals in my hair.  I started by cleansing with baking soda (once or twice per week) and rinsing with Bragg&#x27;s Organic Apple Cider Vinegar.  After doing this routine for nearly a year I decided to research and try organic shampoos to see if I could find one that would work for my hair.  I have very fine hair and therefore do not like using anything that makes it feel heavy.  This was one of the first organic shampoos I tried.  I continued trying others but would always come back to  pura d&#x27; or.  My hair feels light and has a natural shine when I use this product.  I do not use a conditioner.  Yes, it&#x27;s harder to comb my hair after shampooing (medium length hair) but I simply use a pick or wide tooth comb.  I was concerned that without conditioner I would have static hair.  This is not the case with pura d&#x27; or.  This is the best choice I&#x27;ve found for my whole family.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s expensive but it seems to be working. Good organic shampoo. The cause of hair loss is still a mystery. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t regrow your hair but will stop its progress. I would recommend this to anyone especially if you have thin hair. I feel like I&#x27;m feeding my scalp &amp; hair with good nutrition when I use it.</li>
    <li> Great product; just as announced. Makes a lot of foam with just a little amount of the product and the hair feels strong.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair feels and the fact that it has no harsh chemicals. Already second bottle I buy, even though it&#x27;s clearly not a cheap shampoo, surprisingly the first bottle lasted almost 5 whole months, and I have VERY long hair :)&lt;br /&gt;The first one had a defective pump, it didn&#x27;t work quite well.. This one seems to work fine..</li>
    <li> Initially, I thought this product was an average.  However, after using other products with high ratings for a while, I now rate this product one of the best.  I noticed this product really works during this winter season better than other seasons.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second bottle. I felt l lost less hair than before and the hair is stronger. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I am ashamed to say that I have relied on reviews to decide what to purchase on Amazon but have never left one until now. This shampoo is a life saver and that is why I want to encourage others to try it out if their circumstances are similar to mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that was always full as a child but as I hit my thirties has thinned out considerably. My mom had the same problem and I imagined that what I was experiencing was genetic and that there was no hope. On a whim I looked up hair loss products on Amazon. I was reluctant to start using something like Rogaine as I can&#x27;t imagine using it my whole life and the effects it could have on my body. When I found this product I thought it was too good to be true. I ordered and eagerly awaited my package. Upon arrival I was  encouraged at how good it smelled considering that some reviews said it smelled awful. I like tea tree oil so this was right up my alley. Upon my first wash I was very disappointed. It was hard to adjust to the fact that it does not lather like regular shampoo but definitely lathers better than other natural alternatives. The most disappointing part was that my hair felt like hay afterwards. I struggled to believe that this could be healthy but I had made the commitment to try this out and I was going to see it through.. at least a while longer. I used my regular conditioner and went about my day. Didn&#x27;t notice anything particularly noteworthy. However, on day three my secretary said how shiny and healthy my hair looked. I continued to feel disappointed with the feeling of hay hair after rinsing the shampoo and decided to find a rich mask to pair it with. The shampoo and mask combo have me in heaven. If you go this route a definitely recommend you find the right conditioner for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this shampoo for about a month and I can already tell you that my hair is fuller! I don&#x27;t lose hardly any hair in the shower and brushing afterwards. I&#x27;ve even started to notice some new growth! I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens as I continue to use this product and for the first time in a long time feel good about my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I bought. It dries the hair a little bit but does work for preventing hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS, which makes my hair fall out like crazy.  I have tried everything from topical hair-loss shampoos, to oral DHT-blocking supplements--short of chemicals, such as minoxidil (which I prefer not to use).  This Pura d&#x27;or shampoo has helped me more than any other product.  It does not claim to regrow hair, but it actually has helped me to regrow some of the hair I lost, during a very stressful time.  It is the only shampoo I use now.</li>
    <li> Good product,leaves hair feeling clean without overdrying. I can&#x27;t be positive but I think it&#x27;s decreased my hair loss since I started using it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for two weeks now and the result looks promising. I have moderate hair loss and my hair would easily fall out just by running my hand through it. However, after using this shampoo for a week, I started noticing less hair loss. Now, my hair feels stronger and I have very little to no hair falling out while brushing, shampooing, or laying on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does not irritate my scalp or face. It lathers well and leave the scalp feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating it 4 stars for now because it&#x27;s still early, but I am hopeful that with further use, my thinning hairline will fill back in.</li>
    <li> It smells good and feels like that the herbs is helping to reduce the loss of hair. I would like to have another bottle and continue use this.</li>
    <li> Smells great and seems to be working after only a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is great for cleansing the scalp, it&#x27;s my new favorite shampoo because of that.  As for the hair loss prevention part, I feel as though I may not be losing quite as much hair in the shower but I&#x27;m not certain and truly have not been using it long enough (nor had a way to measure things) in order to say one way or another.  However so far I am glad I found this shampoo and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent. It is fresh and clean. It lathers well. I like that it leaves my hair not so dry, and easy to set a style. I notice that my hair falls off less than before, and my husband does not complain about hair on the floor as much anymore, so I think it works. Will keep using it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great. It smells pleasant (nothing overpowering) and the pump bottle is much appreciated. I don&#x27;t know if it has helped with my hair loss, but it is a gentle shampoo with ingredients that won&#x27;t cause breakouts and leaves no residue from rinsing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is FANTASTIC!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and my hair is already more volumous and thick than ever before. I definitely recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a two weeks and it seems to work really hair. It thickens my hair and cleans my scalp. Ever since using it, I have noticed that there have been some regrowth. Whether it is from this product or from something else, I am not sure. I can say that it does clean my scalp well and after having really damaged hair, it is nice to see some regrowth. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a shampoo that has all natural ingredients! I like this shampoo. I&#x27;m still waiting to see if it will help my hair shedding.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this shampoo, You only need to use a small amount to get a great result, love it.</li>
    <li> Shipping it super fast. Only took one day. My friend suggest me to use this one, saying it is really good for preventing hair loss, based on her experience. Guess it will work.</li>
    <li> just used it today, and i can see the difference!! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Don&#x27;t need much for my hair so not much wasting. I&#x27;m used to using the conventional stuff like hand and shoulders and i can feel the differ... after using this product, i can feel my hair being smoother and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;While it is a bit more expensive, i think its worth it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its seems like its great quality and all organic but it made my boyfriend break out in a rash, nothing major but it was irritating him for a few days and now he will not use it. Trying to get a refund.</li>
    <li> it looks and smell good. it seems like consists with natural stuffs,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is fuller. I&#x27;d recommend it over Niacin brand shampoos.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo. My hair is way softer and stronger after I started using it.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product about 3 months ago 4 bottles to test them out. I have some experience in scientific usability testing so I developed a plan to test out this product since the review were very good. For the test, I pretty much cut all my hair off to maximize the exposure area to the product (particularly the top of my head). I also eliminated all the shampoo from other brands so I would only use this one. With this, I took a picture of my current state back then to have a comparison for later on and, as expected of most people, I showered every day. Normally hair regrowth treatments promise to deliver results in 4 months (like Rogain or whatever). So we are in the third month now , I am canceling the experiment because It just doesnt work. As far as hair regrowth in the problematic zones like the top of my head, this product fails in every way. I took a second picture comparison and there is no difference at all, therefore this product will not get you the hair you want. I call it busted.</li>
    <li> I used this product before to prevent my hair loss.  I did help a lot.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does everything a shampoo should do.  It lathers nicely, rinses easily, and leaves my hair feeling clean and full.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. It made my scalp itchy.</li>
    <li> It smells great and leaves my hair feeling stronger. I have tried many products for hair loss and they all are very chemically treated. I am extremely sensitive to those types of products and this shampoo is gentle and does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> About a month I noticed that I start loosing hair on top of my head then my sister suggested  yo try this product, I decide to use it. In about 3 weeks I noticed that my hair less breakable.</li>
    <li> used this fir 5 months so far and have noticeable hair regrowth!!</li>
    <li> Ordered the first bottle in Sept 2013 and it lasted until June 2014.  This shampoo makes a nice lather and leaves my hair and scalp moisturized.  My hair is thin and may scalp has a tendency to get dry, so it is nice to have one product that address both issues in a single application.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo because I loose a lot a lot of hair. Especially after I wash it. I like the smell of this shampoo but still don&#x27;t know if it does anything to my hair. It sort of leaves it dry so definetly have to do something about that. I don&#x27;t think it works for all hair types. But I&#x27;ll still be trying and see how it goes. It is expensive so don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I found this product randomly on Groupon and have been ordering it ever since. I went to Morocco a few years back and upon my return seemed to always hear about things with argan oil and how great and natural they were. I ordered this product because I was looking for something that truly helped my thinning hair. I had tried other shampoos and treatments and was not impressed with their results (NONE). I was hoping this might actually be different and boy was I pleasantly surprised and rewarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is longer and thicker than it has ever been in my adult life. I get compliments on my hair&#x27;s growth and thickness from my hairdresser and my friends. I am so happy with the results, so I keep coming back for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this in combination with other natural hair products and am happy as a clam. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested in growing their hair long and healthier!</li>
    <li> I am using a number of supplements and products, in accordance with my physician&#x27;s directive, for a recent hair loss and this shampoo is among those measures. My doctor really loved that this is made with nearly all natural products (just a tiny bit of preservatives due to the many herbs). We also liked that this shampoo contains saw palmetto and rosemary, both associated with hair growth. Restoration will not happen overnight and you do need to give this time. I just bought my third bottle (but am still on the second bottle) and have noticed a significant reduction in the amount of hair I am losing. Do follow the directions and keep the shampoo on your head for the full two minutes. The product was received sooner than expected and packaged very well.</li>
    <li> Being a guy who&#x27;s losing his hair, I&#x27;m always looking for a) miracles and/or 2) scams.  That being said, I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and there&#x27;s no doubt my hair&#x27;s been in the best shape it&#x27;s been in years.  I don&#x27;t think this is specifically for male pattern baldness, but it&#x27;s definitely not hurting.  The SLS in shampoos was beating the hell out of my hair, and given this is SLS-free, hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped of everything from the root down.  Can&#x27;t comment on it actually preventing hair from falling out (I don&#x27;t think anything short of surgery and a ton of drugs will work for most) but my hair does appear thicker and much healthier than before.  Well done, and moderately priced to boot.</li>
    <li> Would recommend to anyone having issues with hair loss. My husband uses this product and loves it. Works/ smells great</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It is really thick but bubbles up nicely.  I noticed less hair in the drain even after only one use. I only see my hair getting better!</li>
    <li> What a waste of money and a real disappointment!  I am a hairdresser and went out on a limb as I have been using a sulfate free shampoo for years now and this doesn&#x27;t help with itchy and sore scalp and loss of hair of course.  I would send it back but my time is up.  In addition, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling nice unless I use a conditoner.  I think this is a bit of hooey!</li>
    <li> Glad I was stumbled upon this shampoo.  I began to notice my hair was thinning and any major cosmetic surgery was out of the question.  I noticed little hairs regrowing since I started using this product earlier this year.  My hair does have a nice shine (but I was not going for that) and hair is slightly thicker than it was before and the hair loss is no longer noticeable.  Using this shampoo has given me less to stress about and may start using the gold label.  But for now, this has helped me!</li>
    <li> so far I like it.  It is a bit pricy for me but I think it is still worth it.</li>
    <li> Cleans more throughly then neutrogena... Excellant</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! Not only have I seen a difference in the thickness of my hair, but the shampoo also cleans very well and smells great! Highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> great shampoo, its my second bottle because i love it and i see a really change in my hair. Fully recommended. very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My hair always has to suffer because of the dust. Since, it&#x27;s summer, and there&#x27;s a lot of dust in the area where I live, a protective shampoo is needed. Pura d&#x27;or has done a great job in protecting it, and now I haven&#x27;t found any lost hair in the morning, on my pillow.</li>
    <li> the product came &amp; performed great</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair, so most other shampoos/conditioners weigh my hair down, resulting in very little volume. In addition, I found out that I have sensitive scalp, so a lot of other shampoos made my scalp itch. After a few weeks of using this shampoo and the conditioner,  my hair felt so light and soft. I realized how good this product is when my coworker asked me if I got a new haircut, when the only change I made was switching to this shampoo. I&#x27;m not sure how good it is for hair loss prevention, since I mainly used it for a healthier scalp and more volume. I also like the natural smell, unlike the other shampoos with chemical fragrance that irritates my scalp. It is an expensive product, but worth every penny for me.</li>
    <li> Noticeably stopped hair loss however the product is hard to lather.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product. After a couple uses, there has been a noticeable increase in hair volume. Time will tell on the long term benefits, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo that I have ever used. It leaves my hair soft after using it instead of the stripped feeling that I get from other shampoos. It has definitely made my hair strands a little thicker, but I am not sure yet if it is preventing hair loss or promoting new growth.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo which creates hair volume when used. Also minimizes hair loss with continued use.</li>
    <li> Used this shampoo for months and saw no difference.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this shampoo for the hair loss prevention aspect. I have only used it three times so far and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in hair loss yet, but will give it time to hopefully work it&#x27;s magic. With that said, this is still a wonderful shampoo! I have fine hair and this gives it a more noticeable thickness and seems to brighten it up too. Also leaves my hair silky and not weighed down.  Love it! A little goes a long way - well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a VERY nice product! I have tried several products for thinning hair; which as a woman is devastating! pura d&#x60;or is not as expensive as similar products. It also doesn&#x60;t contain all of the frightening array of chemicals. It has a pleasant, clean scent that doesn&#x60;t conflict with other scents you may want to wear.  My hair does feel a bit thicker after the first week, and I like the look and feel. I would, and HAVE recommended it to others. I hate testimonial type things, but I was really okay with this one. Give it a try! It&#x60;s a really nice product!</li>
    <li> My hair is &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; and not weighted down. But I have been using this product for 2 months and have not noticed any reduction in the loss of hair and certainly have not regained my hair.  Although the product did not achieve its desired objective, its not a bad shampoo, its organic, and its not too expensive.  Maybe it works for some other people.</li>
    <li> I had a full head of hair until two years ago when I started taking testosterone shots to fix my hormonal imbalance.  Shortly after starting that, I could run my hand through my hair and had an average of 5-8 hairs come out every time (even if I did it again immediately).  Since testosterone therapy can easily turn into DHT (dihydrotestosterone) and that in turn shrinks hair follicles and make your hair fall out, I did a lot of research on what to buy that would help with that specific problem.  My doctor tried to give me Propecia which keeps your body from turning testosterone into DHT, but it could have serious side effects so I decided to go another route.  Things like Rogaine work for hair loss in the crown area of your head only, but at first it makes you lose more hair, it takes a long time for new growth to start (several months), you have to use it twice a day, and if you stop everything falls back out.  After all my research I decided on this shampoo because it simply washes the DHT off your scalp.  If you look up the ingredients in a search with hair loss you&#x27;ll find several things in the shampoo that are natural ways to deal with DHT.  It doesn&#x27;t claim to make hair grow although I think mine got every so slightly thicker, but it does keep you from losing more hair.  Or at least in my case.  Make sure to follow the instructions, scrub it in really well, and let it sit a minimum of two minutes before you wash it off.  Now when I run my hands through my hair I see an enormous difference in the amount of hair I find between my fingers.  Hope this review helps some other people out and for $22 a bottle it&#x27;s definitely worth the risk in my opinion and I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2.5 months and I still have 1/3 of the bottle left at least.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a scam. It dried out my scalp and gave me severe dandruff and irritation. Furthermore it did not help with any hair loss. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I like it because the contents are organic. Many of the ingredients are natural. So far it looks good. With time, I should be able to prevent as much DHT from hair as possible, owing to effective contents like Saw palmetto.</li>
    <li> I brought the shampoo a few weeks ago and began to use it on a 3x a week basis. I found the less I use shampoo my hair the thicker and the fuller it looks. The shampoo is a pretty fair sense and definitely lathers very nicely. I feel like I have seen pretty fair results since I bought it a few weeks ago. I am very pleased with my purchase and I would highly recommend to anyone else who wants to buy something for Hair thickening.</li>
    <li> one of the best shampoos we have ever used. my wife bought it and encouraged me to use it. delivers consistently. gives a shine to the hair and does help hair growth. we want to try out the gold labelled one soon as well. of all the gazillion shampoos we have used so far this has been the best !</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have bought this shampoo from this supplier. This was by far the cheapest price I have found compared to other sites. I love this stuff though. Smells good and WORKS! You cannot argue organic ingredients like saw palmetto, cedarwood oil and rosemary oil. Thanks for providing the best price with free shipping directly to my doorstep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for around 2 months and have noticed improvement in my hair and the number of hairs in the shower drain. I use this shampoo daily, I massage it in really well and then leave it on for 2 minutes as per the instructions on the bottle. After just a few weeks I noticed less hairs in the shower drain, which was nice. The improvement comes and goes, some days there are more hairs and some less, but overall my hair health seems better. I would assume real improvement will come in the 3 - 6 month range, as that is when hair turns to a new cycle. Along with this shampoo, I have also begun taken Pumpkin Seed Oil (1000 mg a day with breakfast) and performing deutemesence therapy for hair regrowth. Additionally I also cleaned up my diet substantially and supplement with iodine and selenium most days for optimal thyroid function. These techniques seem to be helping and I will be continuing with all of them and I hope to see no more hair loss and hopefully even some regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I would recommend this shampoo to anyone experiencing hair loss, at least to try. Hopefully it works for you. Make sure to leave on for the full 2 minutes ( I also invert my head while I&#x27;m waiting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final note, this shampoo will leave your hair very dry! I have naturally oily hair and it&#x27;s still super dry after getting out of the shower and my hair can tangle easily, if I don&#x27;t condition. So make sure to buy a good quality conditioner to use along with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m cautious about the chemicals that I ingest or contact with my skin, and this product meets my all natural standards. I noticed a steady change in how much hair I was losing during shower time as well. Occasionally when a shampoo is all natural it loses it&#x27;s ability to completely remove dirt &amp; oil, but this very effectively cleans without residue. I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I previously used Surface Awaken which my wife picked up for me based on her hair stylist’s recommendation. It seemed to work with respect to at least preventing hair loss and it seemed to actually restore some thickness. But it’s expensive and I was looking for a similar product that was a little more affordable. Pura d&#x27;or is all organic and Made in USA. One advantage is that the directions call for lathering up only once whereas Surface recommends two latherings. The Pura d&#x27;or bottle is also larger (16oz. vs. 10oz.), uses a convenient pump, and it costs less. The fragrance is light and pleasant as far as I&#x27;m concerned. As for effectiveness, it&#x27;s hard to say. It seems, at least, to be no less effective compared to Surface Awaken which I consider to be a good thing.</li>
    <li> Just received the product, but after one use, my hair feels thick.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 1 year now. I am on my 2nd order now. I can definitely vouch for this product because my hairfall stopped since I started using this. After finishing my shampoo for the first time I thought I don&#x27;t need it anymore. But my hairfall started again. So I ordered again and I am back to normal now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would agree with what others say. This product needs atleast a month&#x27;s use to see any effect.</li>
    <li> The first bottle of this shampoo that I purchased was great. Worked very well. It cleaned my hair and left it nice and soft. I left it a a friends while traveling and liked it so much that I ordered another. The second bottle was NOT the same. The bottle looked the same, it smelled the same,but it was very thick and gooey. I couldnt get it to pump out. I thought there was something wrong with the bottle. It was the shampoo. I used it 3 times before I gave up. It did not lather. It did not clean my hair. It left a sticky, greasy film on my hair that would not rinse out. It also made my head itch. If it had been like the first bottle I would use it all the time. Wont take a chance on getting another bad one.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and use it every time. It smells good and makes my hair feel good. It has only been a couple of days since I started using it so don&#x27;t know if it will slow hair loss, but its worth trying as its a nice shampoo. It lathers surprisingly well. I do leave it on a full 2 minutes before rinsing and applying conditioner.</li>
    <li> Use about a week, and I do use it daily. first 3-4 day still feel like the same, but after 5-6 days I can tell the hair loss less than before. It&#x27;s expensive than other shampoo but I need that to stop my hair loss.</li>
    <li> So far this product has been wonderful on my hair…it feels truly clean afterwards and refreshed! Also my hair has looked a lot thicker and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo three times, and so far it&#x27;s great! I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t wash out very well or might not feel clean enough, but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all. It still lathers nicely, and washes out leaving my hair feeling very clean. I have yet to see if it does make my hair grow back a little bit better (or at least stop shedding, grrr) and am hoping that using a shampoo without the harsh chemicals will help it grow back thicker and healthier like it was once upon a time. I&#x27;m 30 years old, but lately my hair seems like it falls out so easily (stress?) and the actual strands seem a lot more fine and easily snapped.    I used to work at a Dentist&#x27;s office and always remembered hearing the dentist say that toothpastes with sodium lauryl sulfate wore down the enamel on your teeth. I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to realize it, but of course it is probably not good for your hair either!! Had a major \\&quot;duh\\&quot; moment when I finally realized it. Maybe my hair has just been getting really worn out!    So I really love how natural the ingredients are, and the smell does not bother me. This has more of a right to be called \\&quot;herbal essence\\&quot; haha smells like a light blend of essential oils!    So far so good, just going to keep my fingers crossed and give it a couple months to see how my hair starts growing back in!</li>
    <li> it really works!! I like it and will buy it again</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. it really helps grow hair.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks the shampoo thickened and it comes out stretchy and disgusting, like mucous. I don&#x27;t know if you are supposed to shake the bottle before every use, it doesn&#x27;t say anywhere. I guess it just settles in the bottle, but that makes it less effective I would think. Waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Smells good! Love it. Hasn&#x27;t see any change yet but will keep updated!</li>
    <li> Even after only two weeks, I&#x27;m seeing less hair loss.  I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.  The smell of rosemary is a bit much for me but really, I don&#x27;t care as it&#x27;s doing all that I could wish for!</li>
    <li> Excited about using this product!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo because it stopped my hair loss!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and the condition of my hair has improved significantly.  I recommend this product for thinning, dry and brittle hair.</li>
    <li> Bottom line this product will prevent your hair loss, that what I noticed for the last three weeks I&#x27;m using it with the conditioner Pura d&#x27;or premium organic</li>
    <li> Love this product - all organic, no artificial colors, fragrances or parabens. Would definitely recommend it and purchase it again.</li>
    <li> well, I think it is a decent product....no magic results though</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Hair loss prevented. And less itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I&#x27;m a 25 year old losing hair with just brushing but this shampoo has really helped diminish the loss of hair.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!! All I use is this now..no conditioner needed. My hair seems fuller, and even my little acne like red bumps I have had on my scalp went away! Great shampoo!</li>
    <li> Pretty good product and my hair feel smooth after using it</li>
    <li> I bought this product out of impulse and because it is the best selling product on Amazon. If it is the best selling product on Amazon something must be working. I have very thin hair and a few places where it is sparse. With only a couple of days of using the shampoo I can already notice a difference in my hair. I cannot wait for the results after using the product for 3-6 months since that is usually how long it takes to really notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo about 5 times by now.  To me, it reduces hair loss about 30% everytime I shampoo my hair.  Also, I feel like this shampoo doesn&#x27;t overkill all the hair oil.  Not as miracle as I expect, but it is overall a great shampoo to try.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  If she likes it, she will order more!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The scent is great!After using this product,my hair fell at a lower rate.</li>
    <li> Amazing, I have been using this for over 1 year and see great results!</li>
    <li> Fast service, easy to order website, love this product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo leaves my hair very smooth and scalp feeling clean. I will continue to use the product for its effect on my hair and scalp, but I don&#x27;t believe it is significantly reducing my hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and after using my first one for about 3 weeks, my wife commented that my hair looked &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34;. I myself did not notice it as much until I finished the bottle and had switched to another brand with similar ingredients. The change was noticeable in a few days as my hair felt greasy and &amp;#34;weighed-down&amp;#34; using the new shampoo. Then, after going about two months without using the Pura d&#x27;or product, I actually could see the difference myself when I looked in the mirror. My hair did seem thinner and my bald spot more noticeable from the back and sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this second bottle right after and have been using it for several days now with an already easy-to-see difference in the way my hair looks and feels. I don&#x27;t think I will be going back to using anything else now that I have seen the proof myself.</li>
    <li> I was just recently researching shampoos for hair loss on line and came across this one on Amazon. After reading several pages of comments from past users, and seeing that it was the number one seller for hair loss on Amazon for two straight years as well as a great price...Well, I decided it was definitely worth trying. I know some people had said that their shampoo did not lather and I agree, mine does not lather at all either. I was told by a hair dresser once that a good shampoo does not lather...if that is true or not I don&#x27;t know. Also, I have used this shampoo several times and I have found my hair to feel thicker and a bit fuller. My scalp has a slight tingle even on the next day which one may have experienced when using an organic type or dandruff type shampoos. I have naturally curly hair which is not tight curls but loose ones and the only negative I have is...my curls seem SLIGHTLY  &amp;#34;frizzy or separated&amp;#34; looking even though my hair is not dry feeling - just has that appearance. My hair actually is soft without being &amp;#34;too soft&amp;#34;. I did not try this product&#x27;s conditioner with this, but still used a good one that I had at home. I feel that if I use this on a daily basis, it might be too much. I have decided to use this just twice a week and see if that helps. All in all, I do seem to like this shampoo right now and well give it a chance and see how it goes. Remember, everyone has different hair and opinions and the only way to get the one you want, is to try it yourself.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year and have noticed that my hair feels fuller. In between my last order I waited a few weeks to reorder and was using other shampoo and noticed that there was more hair in the drains as well as my hair no looking as full.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> hair fall increased. wasted money on this.</li>
    <li> I used this for a while and didn&#x27;t notice any change in hair loss. Since then I changed to Nizoral, and noticed a decrease in hair loss. I don&#x27;t feel this is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
    <li> I have a receding hair line and I have tried many different products to help slow the process. None have worked as well as Pura d&#x27;or, I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d think that at $25 a bottle, and this is my first bottle, that it would be a full bottle, but was only filled up to the top of the label. Makes me wonder if it was a faulty fill or a customer return? The bottle should be full for this price. Only have used twice now and of course too soon to tell if it helps with hairloss, but so far it has not. Will know more when I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> I  have noticed a tremendous difference in in my hair since using this product, I have had less hair in my hair brush and hair has had less split ends</li>
    <li> I just order my third bottle. I can&#x27;t attest to its claim of hair loss prevention - but all in all I like this shampoo and feel it helps keep my hair quite healthy and fresh. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> It is awesome. I did find my hair lose less after shower. It is very smooth. It smell good as well.</li>
    <li> Been using this shampoo for over a couple of years now. It has noticeable reduced my hair loss and has strengthen my existing hair. Would recommend to pair it with regular minoxidil medicine for best results.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for some time and have seen less hair loss.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pretty great. The first time I used it, it looked like I was shedding tons of hair but after that first try, I have been noticeably losing less. My boyfriend loves it too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a month and I have not seen any results with my hair loss. This shampoo does smell good, but it most definately dries your scalp out and it really tangles the hair so  even after using conditioner I wind up losing  more hair because it is difficult to untangle.I continue using to see if I have any improvement, but as of yet I am skeptical.</li>
    <li> Excellent ingredients, and seems like a quality product. Packaging and bottle were in perfect condition as well.  I will re-review after I have used the product longer, but so far I love it!</li>
    <li> I have noticed less hair in the sink since using this product. Love the way it makes my hair feel and it has a fresh clean smell.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will do.  At least in my case it did.  When it comes to hair regrowth everybody&#x27;s body chemistry is different, and there are plenty of different factors in our lives that can help or not help in hair loss prevention/regrowth.  I eat healthy for the most part and use minoxidil 5%.  I did see an improvement with this product, and it smells good.</li>
    <li> So far it seems to be working, although it leaves my hair a bit dry. I&#x27;ll try to compensate with a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> it makes my scalp red....&lt;br /&gt;i want to return it</li>
    <li> I have been facing severe hair fall and thinning since past many years now and have almost tried all sorts of products and treatments. Nothing really worked for me ever. I have tried biotin and other treatments too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought this and have been using it for some time now and I must say that seems to be working. I will not say that this is magical and resolves all my hair related issues. But yes this surely has added some more volume and I do see less hair falling after shower. Which is more than I expected initially and enough to make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this for sure but its important to manage expectations and give it time to work.</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dear father. He kept losing hair and became 20% bald for the past 15 years of hard work. As his only daughter, I do care about him. Then I got recommendations from my friends. They are saying this product is really really helpful for growing hairs. I doubted about their saying. But you know what? I just wanna give it a try. After one month&#x27;s use, my father is really happy about it because his hair stopped falling off and starts to grow now. What a fantastic gift! And also his hair become more thick and dark. FYI, my father is Asian with black hair. Age:51.</li>
    <li> After using it for a week, i am still losing hair after shower but I feel my hair loss in is under control. There are fewer hair left in the tub.</li>
    <li> I am 35 y.o. woman. My hair became thin and began falling out after divorce time. I was reading a lot about hair loss...So I ve strarted taking vitamins complex Das Gro Hair Formula and treating my hair with this great product. You WILL see much less fall out! My hair looks thicker and healthier. I m going to stick with this shampoo. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Working good I see less hair falling out.</li>
    <li> My hair is thicker and has more volume just after using this product for 2 months. I will continue to purchase this product. My rating of &#x27;I like it&#x27; will probably move to &#x27;I love it&#x27; after a couple more months of using the product.</li>
    <li> After i used it my hair feels softer and looks better, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month but I do notice less hair loss . I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is gentle and leaves my hair feeling very clean and very soft.</li>
    <li> Love how my hair feels after using the shampoo. The frizzyness has gone away. just great feeling overall!!!!</li>
    <li> its very comfortable to use...</li>
    <li> I purchased this the other day and used it today.  The smell is earthy, not sweet or flowery like other shampoos.  I&#x27;m okay with that, as long the shampoo works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washes out well, and leaves my hair soft and very shiny with nice volume.  So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really like are the ingredients.  It contains plenty of things that help to nourish the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also taking it with maxi-hair vitamins to see if this combination will work to regrow the thinning hair at my temples. I also quit using a flouride rinse twice a day, something I believe to have caused my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in a couple months. but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;day 1: so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! From the smell, to the feel... Now my roommate is using it, damn it!!! And my great concern was, is it tested on animals? IT&#x27;S NOT!!! I am so happy!!! Great job Pura D&#x27; Or \m/</li>
    <li> i have been using this produce for two months i&#x27;m so happy it works to me i will cotinue to use this shampoo&lt;br /&gt;.great product  Love it</li>
    <li> Easily the best shampoo I have used.  Some other organic shampoos don&#x27;t leave your hair as clean and shiny as this. I am never going back to the name-brand garbage!</li>
    <li> Leaves the hair oily and gave me dandruff!</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo and Minoxidil 5% for about four years. I have noticed a significant improvement in new hair growth and a reduction in hair loss. I am not sure if one product is having more of an impact but I don&#x27;t plan on modifying the routine any time soon.</li>
    <li> I used to fill the bathroom floor with hair every time I brushed my hair but I could see a significance reduction on hair found on floor after using the shampoo for just a few days!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed less hair falling out, but what I did notice is like a film type of heavy weight oil on my hair. Guess il go back to the drawing board..</li>
    <li> This product is really good</li>
    <li> Love using it...... not sure about helping with hair loss.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has stopped hair loss after two weeks of use. It leaves the scalp and hair feeling great. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone with thinning hair to try it out and see for themselves.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing product. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I like it！ It smells good. The most amazing thing is that my hair became very soft and looks like silk :) My hair feels shiny. I definitely recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> On a second bottle and it seems to help (not stop) the hair loss.</li>
    <li> One of the best product I have ever used for hair loss control purpose. My wife is extremely happy and she see very visible difference as far as hair loss is concern. In past I have used many other products but this one different with positive difference. Keep making such great products.</li>
    <li> Smells good, hair feels clean. Too soon to tell if it prevents hair loss but I like the fact that it is organic, will most likely buy again.</li>
    <li> I think this is used the most effective Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was not really sure what to expect since this was the first time using an Organic shampoo, As with all products that boast a claim that by using it you will prevent hair loss, I was skeptical, but I actually like using this product. I have only been using this shampoo for a few weeks but it does seem that my hair loss has diminished. I still see hair loss but not at the rate I was seeing before I started using this shampoo.  It lathers very easy and provides good coverage. It has a nice soft smell and it does seem to make my hair softer and feel great.  It is worth giving this Shampoo a try.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it helps with hair loss, but I know it leaves your scalp with a tingling feeling, and you hair will be squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice minty smell without being overwhelming. Seems to really clean the hair without stripping it of essential oils.</li>
    <li> I am a caucasian female in my 30&#x27;s and was experiiencing excessive hair shedding for an extended period of time (6-12 months). I believe it was a combination of stopping oral contraceptives and stress. It was an all over shed, not certain areas. Naturally, I was concerned and started neurotically researching ways to stop the shedding. I really disliked the idea of Rogaine/etc and wanted to go a more natural route, if possible. I came across this shampoo and was pleased that it was SLS &amp; paraben free and combined several natural ingredients that are known DHT blockers. I started using this at the same time I started spironolactone prescribed to me by my dermatolgist. That was 8 months ago and I am back to normal shedding. I use this shampoo about 5x a week. I lather it up the first thing when I get in the shower and leave it on for the duration of my shower, letting it sit on my scalp as long as possible. I rarely use conditioner because my hair is thin and straight. It does a great job cleaning the scalp and leaves my hair with lots of volume. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Even though my shampoo seems to have busted open in  the package when I got it, I have used up about half of what was left inside of it and so far it&#x27;s working AMAZING!! I recently went from black to blonde hair and had to cut my hair off from bra strap length to shoulder lenght!! I was horrified and even though I had no more split, fried ends my hair was still coming out when I brushed it. Ever since I started using this shampoo the hair loss has stopped drastically! Definitely would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for only about a week, so I can&#x27;t really speak to the hair-prevention promise. But this shampoo does work well on my increasingly gray and coarse hair. Plus, it lathers up nicely, so a little bit goes a long way. I expect this bottle to last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and I notice that my hair has been thinning out the past few years.  As of today, I have used this product for about a week so I can&#x27;t say for sure if it works for me as of yet.  What I&#x27;ve noticed is that less hair falls out during and after I shower.  This is enough hope for me to continue using the product! I usually have a handful of hair that I lose after I finish showering.  For the past week, I notice that I would lose a third or half that amount.  I still do notice loose strands of hair throughout the day (which is common for me).  Although I&#x27;m not very fond of the herbal smell of the shampoo while using it, I love the soft and silky feeling it leaves my hair once it dries.  Also worth mentioning is that the smell from the shampoo while showering does go away once my hair is dry.  I would definitely continue using this product and hope that with time, it would help me reverse my hair loss.</li>
    <li> Every wash feels great. It doesn&#x27;t feel as if my hair is being stripped of all natural oils after every usage. However, it leaves my hair and scalp feeling clean and fresh! Pretty happy with this.</li>
    <li> So far so good ! i have been using this product for about a month now i can feel my hair getting thicker and feels stronger !</li>
    <li> the item is good , i like it ,i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 6 months and it is the only one i will use, I suffer from SD. Feelings refreshing when leaving it in.</li>
    <li> I have this and Moroccan oil shampoo both.  Moroccan oil is a good shampoo, but not for hair loss, though I love it.  I bought this for the hair loss prevention qualities.  Its a little heavy for finer hair, and I use this in conjunction with Revita hair loss shampoo and other things.  Not sure if its working, though my hair loss isn&#x27;t as bad when I do all my regimen.  However, the smell, I just don&#x27;t like.  It won&#x27;t keep me from buying it, but I only use it in a rotation with other shampoos.</li>
    <li> My 3rd bottle!!!! Hair is growing!! and much thicker!!!! Only shampoo I will use forever! This was a live saver!!!</li>
    <li> It is quite helpful! I am losing hair consistently in the past year. Used this shampoo. I can see less hair loss for sure!</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I Will update after time periods!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo that would be better on my hair. Everything I tried in the past had so many chemicals and soaps. I was looking online for how often men should shampoo and found this product someone recommended. I have just started using it, but so far I love it.</li>
    <li> Visibly seen less hair fall. It&#x27;s crazy!!! It does make the hair feel a bit dry but a little conditioner helps! Doesn&#x27;t need too much. I recommend this definitely.</li>
    <li> This has made my hair feel so much better and fuller with just a few uses already. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recently was in need of a good shampoo that would help with preventive hair loss as I go to the salon and bleach it all the time.  A friend of mine told me about this shampoo and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with how fast it arrived and the smell is wonderful.  It feels really good on the scalp and even though I visit the salon monthly I am noticing a big reduction in hair breakage and loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go to shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost 2 years. I do feel it helps.</li>
    <li> Seems like a good shampoo. Coming from Head and Shoulders, this is certainly an upgrade in price; however, it appears to be working well. I cannot tell if it is stopping hair loss though.</li>
    <li> This has some function in preventing losing hairs. I like it. And it also has good smells.</li>
    <li> Amazing smelling product, leaves my hair feeling healthy and shiny. I will be stocking up on this!</li>
    <li> Love it! It has helped preventing more hair loss.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo! After only 3 washes I feel like so much less hair is coming out!</li>
    <li> Only one week of use but I think the product is great will buy again no doubt</li>
    <li> Once you open it you have 5-months to use it otherwise it turns into a thick gel and the pump is unable to extract shampoo. Purchased 2- bottles to get free shipping but after 6 months the other bottle turned into a thick molasses, Elmer&#x27;s glue type texture. What a waste of $20. Other than that it&#x27;s just shampoo as I did not notice any difference, foams great.</li>
    <li> #1 this bottle last a long time. It takes a couple of pumps and a lot of water but my hair looks so good after. I was having a lot of trouble with hair loss due to a side-effect of some RXs. Biotin supplement, a Keratin conditioner, and this shampoo made all the difference. I have even recommended it to an acquaintance who is recovering from chemo and regrowing her hair. I don&#x27;t often repurchase something unless it blows me away. I would recommend this to anyone who wants fuller, thicker hair or is dealing with hair loss issues. Mine was coming out in clumps and now it&#x27;s too thick to put in a ponytail. (gives me a headache). Cost isnt bad because it last several months. Buy it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling soft and clean!</li>
    <li> my hairloss has decreased since i started using this 6 months ago. My mom got it for me as a gift and I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It makes my hair clean and shiny. I will continue using</li>
    <li> I just received this product and used it once. I don&#x27;t like the smell. However my hair dropped less than before. Because this is the first time I used it, I can not say for sure whether this product is useful or not, but I felt good.</li>
    <li> I have a hair loss problem so I just bought a bottle and try. After finish one, i would say this product help me a lot the hair feel stronger, and it smells and feels great. Other people have the same problem could try for a shoot.</li>
    <li> Remember its preventing, not regrowing.&lt;br /&gt;and it definitely helps with preventing!&lt;br /&gt;I am planning on keep using this shampoo, great!!</li>
    <li> Still not sure how effiently is working</li>
    <li> This product is a fraud product, did not help me at all. Do yourself a favor, don&#x27;t buy this product, waste of money that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 2 months and my Hair and Scalp are definitely looking and feeling better. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to make a change and getting chemicals out of your Beauty products....I love this product and will never go back to another :) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Five Stars from a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I like this shapoo it make my hair look full and healty but I gave it a 4 stars review because I got dandruff.</li>
    <li> It smells good and leaves my hair moist as if I used a conditioner also. It&#x27;s also helping keep my hair fuller. My new shampoo!</li>
    <li> I tired this after reading raving reviews on Amazon. It does volumize, but do note that is purely cosmetic. Meaning I did not grow any new hair or it did not stop my hair loss. But it did create volume when i blew dry. I did not like how the hair felt after shampoo, sort of coarse not at all smooth. It smells nice and the ingredients are good but unfortunately it did nothing to help my hair loss.</li>
    <li> Gentle on hair. Makes scalp a little oily though.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! Less expensive than my previous hair loss shampoo! No SLS (sulfates); No parabens; No DEA; No harsh chemicals! All shampoos should come in a pump bottle. It eliminates a lot of waste. Highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
    <li> This is the shampoo I currently trust the most. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of shampoos for my troublesome hair. Some of them seemed nice for awhile, but even the best ones always disappointed after awhile. This particular shampoo has held up the longest and rarely has it disappointed despite what I would call hair that requires very high maintenance. I would give it 4 and1/2 stars out of 5 or 9 out of 10 if those were an option (I rarely give a full, 5 star amazon rating for anything.)</li>
    <li> I can see the difference from using the first bottle, will spread the word how fast and good this product works.  Thanks JIM CAMERON</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and have found it to be a huge step up from my previous shampoo. After the first use, I noticed that my hair was already much softer and felt cleaner. Time will tell if it helps to prevent my thinning hair from getting worse but I&#x27;m hopeful! I will follow up with results in a month!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product - Would definitely purchase again!!</li>
    <li> So far I am enjoying this product. It leaves my hair squeaky clean and I don&#x27;t have to consume a lot of it. I&#x27;m not sure if it has helped with the hair loss. At this stage I&#x27;ll have to give it more time and come back with a review.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo ever. Lathers quickly. Uses in conjunction with HairMax Professional 12 Laser Comb.</li>
    <li> First time I used this I felt my hair was frayed a bit from DHEA removal. after spraying in a little leave in conditioner and blow drying, my hair looked so shiny and healthy. Guess this stuff can accumulate in the hair follicle. I took it orally and it made my hair fall out. Doctor&#x27;s aren&#x27;t doing you a favor by trying to give you more orally when your within normal range.</li>
    <li> Great organic shampoo, I have notice my hair is healthier and full of life, I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> So far I have noticed a difference.  I have noticed a decrease in my hair loss.  I hope it continues to improve as I use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> While I haven&#x27;t noticed a substantial reduction in my hair loss from using this shampoo, I have noticed my hair become much more clean and managable. This shampoo is a perfect balance between cleansing and nourishing. It doesn&#x27;t make your scalp feel stripped, but it does provide a nice , clean, just-got-out-of-the-shower feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the shampoo for a little voer a week now. I have hair with highlights and foundmy hair was always so tangley. In addition to the tangles I was also seeing a good amount of hair coming out after every shower, brushing and even a few strands thats come out just from finger combing. I learned about this product because my sister told me she&#x27;d been losing her hair too and had been using this product for a few months and she sees a difference in the amnt of hair falling out. After a few washings I can definitely attest that my hair is never tangled following the shampoo and towel dry. Perhapd it&#x27;s too soon to see aobut how it&#x27;ll improve the hair retention but the tangleness going away definitely helps in not pulling out hair unecessarily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo for a few weeks but the immediate results are really apparent. My hair looks fuller and any thinning is less obvious. In the short term, I&#x27;m really happy but I do question whether it&#x27;s just adding body to my hair or if it will prevent hair loss in the long run. Time will tell, but it&#x27;s great in the immediate.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo, it stopped the itching and hair loss, I will not use any other shampoo.</li>
    <li> There are different opinions on this product. I’ve been using it for few days so I cannot comment on the effectiveness to present hair loss, but I’m confident based on some of the reviews. I will make another comment in few months based on the results.&lt;br /&gt;On the other side, it looks a high quality product. I like it from its consistency to how it smells and leaves nice perfume on the hair.</li>
    <li> Horrible!! It did nothing to help me with my hair issue. Never using any Pura d&#x27;or product again!!</li>
    <li> I have used it for the last few days. It definitely helps to reduce my hair loss. Not only that, it leaves my hair smooth and shiny as well. I hope my hair loss would reduce less and less as I keep using the product. Love the product and definitely will tell my friends about it.</li>
    <li> I have tried today Pura d&#x27;or Hair loss organic shampoo and I was really satisfied from the result. Already I can see progress, reduce of the hair loss and my hair are really soft and shiny. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best organic shampoo  so far, I fell a difference in  my hair.I really like this shampoo and use it every time. I would recommend this to anyone especially if you have thin hair.This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I started using this for post-baby hair loss and have loved it so much it&#x27;s become our only shampoo in the house (except baby shampoo.)  Love that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of extra chemicals and junk in it.  Smells great!  And it doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to feel greasy after a day of not washing it (which I think is part of the downside of using harsher products.)</li>
    <li> Seriously awesome! I use this on my kids too! It smells amazing and the conditioner is just the same. I love knowing I&#x27;m putting clean organic products in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also going to last me a while. A lot goes a long way. I have very thick hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product as well as the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am not convinced that it helps my hair regrow, but it certainly feels like I have less hair loss since I started using this shampoo. My hair feels healthier and not as dry as before. I keep using this product for now.</li>
    <li> The shampoo was great. I have never had any trouble with hair growth but simply tried it to see if it would promote the growth of my hair that way I could get more frequent trims. I also have extremely fine hair so it was important me to get a product without sulfate (easier on each strand). It smells lovely and the price really can&#x27;t be beat. Only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is due to the fact that I haven&#x27;t been using it for an extended period of time.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo two weeks ago, and I see the difference in the texture of my hair-it has become more smooth and straight. My hair does look healthier, and my scalp feels fresher when I come out of the shower. I like the smell of the natural ingredients. I will have to continue using it to determine its effect on hair loss. I am confident that I will see positive results.</li>
    <li> This is the third bottle I have used and continue to be quite pleased.  A little goes a long way so the price is not extreme when you consider that one bottle can last 3 months or more.  The product can be used on a daily basis without drying out the hair.  It gently cleanses the hair and scalp.  I use it in combination with Rogaine and I think my hair loss has diminished.</li>
    <li> I want to use this product for a longer time because it did help with my hair. I will post an update after a few months.</li>
    <li> I still don&#x27;t believe that there is a shampoo that could prevent hair loss. However, Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic shampoo has been very gentle with my sensitive scalp. I would say that this awesome shampoo has been at least &amp;#34;slowing down&amp;#34; my hair loss? :)</li>
    <li> I have used numerous hair loss prevention shampoo in the past few years and none of them really worked. Honestly, I just started to use this shampoo so it is still early to tell. However, I can say that I see less hair falling out during shower and it is a good sign. After several months of use, I will update my review.    UPDATE    I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for several weeks now and I see about the same amount of hair fall during the shower. I had to reduce my star rating to 3 now.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, it has a great smell and used with the conditioner it leaves your hair super soft. I leave it on my scalp for two minutes and I scrub the scalp with a &amp;#34;scrub brush&#x27;&amp;#34; to stimulate growth and get rid of dead skin... the only issue I have is that I still loose hair :( I don&#x27;t have any bald spots or anything like that but I thought it would make me have less hair on my bathroom floor than usual.. I have been using it for about three weeks now and I will keep using it at least for a couple of months to see if there will be a difference.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well and I like the way it makes a thick lather. That seems to be the problem with may organic shampoos. That, and they smell bad. This smells great though and I feel like I am using any other (of the same type) shampoo. I do, however, wish it was a bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> Its a great shampoo to give your hair a little fuller look.  Its not as harsh on hair as some of the other non-organic products I have used.  It will NOT make you grow new hair, but might help you keep more of your hair with a healthy scalp. I&#x27;m not sure if there is a good conditioner to go with this so I use my regular one.  Overall its a good shampoo, but I&#x27;m not a scientist about its hairloss effects...</li>
    <li> The shampoo feel rich in the hair and doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair as much as other shampoos go. Cannot say anything about reducing hair loss yet, too early. I am glad though i am not putting sulphates in.</li>
    <li> I placed an order for shampoo and conditioner both. Unfortunately, I received only conditioner and no shampoo this time - it was lost in delivery as per customer service. But I have used this shampoo before as well and I really like how hair feels fresh and soft after using the shampoo alone. Also I cannot say that hair loss has stopped completely but definitely it is better than before. So for shampoo 5 stars, but for not getting the product I am taking off 1 star.</li>
    <li> At first, when I used this shampoo I felt a lil volume added to my hair. Second time, I noticed zero hair loss while washing my hair and I felt &amp;#34; wow&amp;#34; this is something that I was searching for my whole life !! But later on it was like the usual shampoo. It definetly adds volume to your hair no doubt about it. I would give 5 stars for volume and 3 stars for hair loss prevention !!</li>
    <li> its a great product used it three times already see the results.</li>
    <li> smells good and cleans well</li>
    <li> Using this productd for a couple years now and love it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  I got it because it was recommended to me for fine hair, to strengthen hair, and it works great!  Also love that it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it folks, anything you buy in a bottle is processed and will have some type of preservative or artificial additive that is used as a stabilizer, scent or increases the viscosity of the product. That being said, I found this shampoo to be an excellent choice for my hair type which tends to be dry and frizzy. I use raw argan oil after I shampoo to finish the treatment and the texture of my hair is soft and manageable. for the size of bottle and the amount I use (one squirt), I think it&#x27;s a great value. I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that just started working after two weeks.  I&#x27;ve had quarter size hair loss before using this for two weeks.  Now I have a dime size amount.  No other supplements have been effective, and this is the only thing that has started to work.  I&#x27;ll have to write an update, but so far I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> it is great to stop hair falling. I have been losing hair since I move to New York, and I don&#x27;n know if it is because of the water here. But using this shampoo makes the situation much better.</li>
    <li> received this product a few days ago and i couldnt wait to use it! my hair is extremely frizzy and this shampoo has helped calm it down! not sure yet if it will prevent hair loss but im excited to see the results! so far i am very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> This product feels amazing. My entire scalp feels different after I use it. I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week, but so far it&#x27;s on par with the experience I&#x27;ve read about in other customer reviews. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this shampoo for a long time</li>
    <li> the shipping was super fast. when used it was very smoothy. it smells like there is no artificial fragrance. even just used once, way less hair loss. looking forward to trying their conditioner</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for sensitive hair, I don&#x27;t feel it re grew hair but a good shampoo to use alongside minoxidil. I do feel it had some effect on stopping the hair loss though, I notice les hair when I shampoo falling off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for one week and maybe less hair loss. I will draw my conclusion after finishing my first bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this for me and it seems to be working. I have very long hair and only need just a little to get my hair looking clean. The bottle has lasted for awhile. I can&#x27;t say for sure that it has helped with hair loss prevention but I have not noticed my hair getting any thinner!</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair soft and shiny.  The sent is strong, but not bad.  Lathers nice and cleans well.  I have not noticed any hair growth yet, but I have only used it for a week now.</li>
    <li> strange smell... but worth trying if you have hair problems. at least it won&#x27;t make things worse.</li>
    <li> This actually reduced my hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;I also like the smell... :)</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my hair- Sorry wish it had</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband. He used it tonight for the first time. He said it smells like there are some drug ingredient in it. The shampoo foams very well, so he thought it should help to wash the scalp very  clean. Hope it will stop his hair loss first and then helps to grow his new hair. I will keep watching and post my second review after he finishes using the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 6 weeks and so far I like it. Although it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it works on preventing hair loss, the shampoo is nice for daily use.</li>
    <li> Light shampoo that feels and smells natural. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp like some other hair loss shampoos. Does dry my hair out a bit so I need to apply a separate conditioner. Time will tell if regular use has a positive effect on androgenic alopecia.</li>
    <li> at the very least i can say that i definitely lose way less hair in the shower when using this stuff. i also love the smell and love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> It has stopped the hair loss, this shampoo leave the hair soft and strong.  It feels better than regular shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a year with pretty good results.</li>
    <li> product works great! highly recommend this product for people with fine hair.</li>
    <li> Hair loss is a problem I worry about every day. And I am happy to try this product. It prevents hair loss.</li>
    <li> There are plenty of hair loss prevention products out there but I picked it cuz it makes me feel ensured and safer when it&#x27;s made of all the natural and organic stuffs. I won&#x27;t lie by saying it works instantly but when you put it on for a week or two, you can feel differences.</li>
    <li> It does control hair fall</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Leaves your hair smelling nice while giving it a nice shine.  Not sure if it really prevents hair loss but my hair looks healthier.</li>
    <li> After  my pregnancy with my daughter, I noticed my hair was falling out. I did not panic because I read that it was normal because of the hormones. Within a year my hair was back to normal pre-pregnancy. Now three years later my hair is again falling out. After trying many shampoos recommended by my doctor for hair loss, I finally found one that works. I have definitely noticed less hair falling out within the week. I also purchased the organic conditioner and it smells lovely. I will followup a month later.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my father for his hair loss problem. He tried many other alternatives, but this worked well. Overall he is happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. I used it only one time, and can feel hair loss is less than normal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo three times so far and I would say it definitely keeps my hair very soft and clean!! The smell is very fresh and natural as well. However, the only thing that bothers me the most is that it gives me itchy scalp every time I use it. Haven&#x27;t noticed any huge changes on preventing hair loss part yet. Will continue to use it &#x27;til it&#x27;s finished and see what the final result is.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for me. When I using it, my head skin is a little hot and feel very comfortable. I think it really can prevent hair loss as the expectation.</li>
    <li> Be careful if you have a sensitive scalp. I&#x27;ve been losing hair due to a hormone imbalance (still trying to get to root cause), and there is an ingredient (or more) that I am allergic/sensitive to in this product that is causing my hair to fall out. I determined this by stopping and starting the shampoo at different times weeks apart. I&#x27;m sure this product works well for those without additional sensitivities/allergies.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple months. I went through a bad breakage cycle which prompted me to chop 6+ inches of hair. I have a very full head of fine curly, dry hair. I use this product twice a week. I have shoulder length hair and I use 2-4 pumps depending on how greasy it is. Just make sure you pair it with a good conditioner. Along with making other health changes my hair is finally healthy. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It really worked for me!</li>
    <li> This was a repeat order. Hair seems to grow noticeably thick while using this shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t lather up as well as your normal shampoos, but that seems to be the case with most shampoos with organic ingredients. Problem solved by using more than one pump. One side effect is that it stimulates unwanted hair growth around other parts of your body. Probably because the shampoo inevitably gets in contact while lathering and rinsing. I was never that hairy, so this was slightly noticeable.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It hydrates and softens in the first use.</li>
    <li> Very good! It works for me very well! Kind of expensive!</li>
    <li> somewhat functions,but cannot terminate hair loss！</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Much less hair loss since using it.</li>
    <li> This definitely works for stop hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I also just bought the conditioner.</li>
    <li> husband really likes this shampoo</li>
    <li> I recently lost quite a bit of weight rather rapidly (a good thing), but about 5 months into the weight loss I began losing hair rapidly as well (not a good thing).  Every day I was worried about brushing my hair because I would see massive amounts of my already very fine hair in the brush.  I did a little research on various products that claimed to prevent/cease hair loss.  I settled on this product due to the great reviews and I am so glad that I did.  After about a week of using the shampoo, I noticed significantly less hair in my brush/in the drain.  My hair is shiny, full of body, and from what I can tell, it&#x27;s beginning to fill back in again.  The only thing I don&#x27;t love about this product is the smell- tea tree oil, maybe?  It&#x27;s not terrible but it&#x27;s definitely not my favorite.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I loved how it has been working on my hair so far. As advertised, this shampoo is very gentle with good smell. My hair is oily and this product not only helped increase my hair volume, but also prevents dandruff. Definitely will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> So far nothing new. idk how long you were suppose to use this product before it starts working. but for now nothing new same old hair.</li>
    <li> Trying this the first time. Hoping to have my hair strengthen. Don&#x27;t see much drastic change.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells and feels AMAZING! I can&#x27;t say much about how it&#x27;s helped me with hair loss yet because I just received it but in a month if I start seeing a difference I&#x27;ll edit this review and add the fifth star. I like how the product is cruelty free and certified organic. Let&#x27;s hope it helps with hair loss!</li>
    <li> Although I read some complaints, I enjoy the smell which is very similar to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree shampoo (probably because it contains tea tree oil). A little goes a long way and does a great job cleaning my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and have experienced good results. It won&#x27;t grow hair back but it certainly helps you keep the hair you have. Hair shaft thickness significantly improved.</li>
    <li> Been trying out many products that were nonmedicinal and this one seems to be working well.  With thinning hair, this shampoo seems to bring it to a fuller volume.  Although I don&#x27;t use any conditioner, my hair (with its thinning qualities) seem to be soft already.  The smell is good and not pungent like other hair products.  My hair feels less oily too after washing.  Will continue to update.  (this is my 6th day using it)</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Smells fantastic, feels very thick and builds to a rich lather that lasts a few minutes.  I have only been using the product for a couple weeks and my hair feels heartier and thicker already.  I will continue to be  customer.</li>
    <li> The product does everything as advertise. I was skeptical at first but after a few uses I noticed a difference in my hair, it has begun to grow back fairly fast and I love the smell and lather of this product. I have tried more hard-core regimens, but they were harsh on my hair. Good thing I discovered this shampoo and am a true believer. My hair is healthy, soft, shiny and no more bald spots. This is the best product for your hair that you could every buy&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;!t works! Within a few weeks I noticed a difference! I am so pleased with this product. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over two years and have experienced good results.  I can&#x27;t really attest to the effectiveness of hair loss prevention because I use  Rogaine, but my hair is definitely much better than before.  I  like this shampoo and use it every time. It smells good and makes my hair feel good. Also I have my hair colored every two months and this shampoo does not affect the color at all.  It has no detergents or chemicals</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help with hair loss and leave the hair dry.</li>
    <li> its really working my niece hair was very thin and slowly growing, within the first bottle (within 3 month) her hair become thick and much longer</li>
    <li> This is a great product with the proper ingredients needed to slow hair loss. I&#x27;ve noticed much less hair in the shower drain over the 2 weeks +. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out or strip my hair and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve tried many of the products on the market with very limited results and questionable ingredients. The fact that it&#x27;s organic is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> Smells great and hair looks more full, vibrant and healthy.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It does work, but... it&#x27;s not a miracle cure and I&#x27;m not sure the random stray hairs that come back in your bald areas look particularly better than just embracing the baldness... so probably best to start this product at the first signs of thinning, instead of waiting until it&#x27;s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shampoo it&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t use a conditioner, but it&#x27;s still not really strong enough for my hair, and seems to build up after a while, so occasionally I&#x27;ll use something else like Head&amp;Shoulders to strip the hair down. The shampoo smells a bit like pine trees and &amp;#34;Christmas herbs&amp;#34;, but the smell isn&#x27;t particularly strong or unappealing and mostly washes out with the rinse. The dispenser works well and dispenses a sufficiently meager quantity that a single bottle will likely last about half a year or so. From a cost stand point, that probably makes this shampoo quite a bit cheaper than general use store bought shampoos. About the lathering, my house has significantly alkaline water, and (assuming you have enough hair left to lather with) the shampoo lathers up just fine.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  Works like magic.  Just starting using it and will continue doing so.</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells so good! Everyone in my family uses it, including the 4 yr old. The texture of hair seems to be stronger after this shampoo. It is good on my colored hair too. So no need to get a special shampoo for me. The reason I give it a four star is because the dispenser got me stuck for two days until I asked my husband to open it.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have used. I will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I noticed significant hair-loss in the shower with my previous shampoo. After using this shampoo, I noticed it was definitely less aggressive on my hair follicles then what I was using. After using for about 3 months I can certainly tell that I am loosing less hair in the shower for sure. I even notice some growth of new hair on my hairline. I will continue to use this product and I even got a friend to buy some (still to early for review). I gave 4 Stars because I do not consider this the holy grail solution for hair-loss. Though it helped significantly, I do still do think I will need something else in the future. I do not believe this product can work for everyone being there are many different types of hair-loss. Also, for those who may be wondering, I am a male in my upper 20s, with thick dark brown hair that is thinning pretty much everywhere, but only noticeable by my regular barber and myself.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order the product at first since the price seem quite high compared to the amount of product per bottle. However, I am happy with the product now that I began using it since I feel like just a little shampoo goes a long way. The only thing I would recommend adding is the vanilla/lavender smell from the conditioner to the shampoo. It does seem to help a little with hair lost.</li>
    <li> It is pretty good,I like it.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than I got what I expected. Hair felt smooth, silky, and healthy from the first use. The texture of the shampoo and the smell are both very natural. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or drying. Simplicity goes a long way, and this product has captured that notion quite nicely. I recommend getting the conditioner to follow up.</li>
    <li> I googled and read so many reviews on Amazon, only to try the product and be very disappointed. Seems like this shampoo stripped my hair, leaving it feeling dry and brittle. Also removes permanent hair color. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff lasts a long time because concentrated.  I ordered in September and am reordering now in January.  Shampoo every other day.  I am shedding less.  A dermatologist gave me a prescription strength nizoral shampoo, and I didn&#x27;t like that at all, it messed with the texture of my hair.  So I am shedding less, but I am doing lots of other things...taking D3 and Biotin, eliminated Colgate Total toothpaste and other items I had which had that active ingredient which they now say is an endocrine disruptor.  I stopped using my K-cups machine and went back to french press...something about brewing in that little plastic cup even if bpa free bothers me and when I thought back to what I had changed in last 2 years in my life, when my hair shedding first started to accelerate - that item was about same time.  Together these things are helping.  Is my hair like when I was 21?  No, but it is growing, as in I need a haircut occasionally now again, and some of my thinner areas, mostly by temples are growing some more hair.  Some progress.  Not a miracle.  Your hair will feel clean afterwards without feeling stripped, and it smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> Ive used this product for about a year now.. It definitely helps prevent hair loss, although it does not re-grow hair. Only product ive used that actually slows/prevents hair loss. Just ordered another bottle!!!</li>
    <li> Within one week of starting use, I noticed a difference in the amount of hair loss in my comb each morning.  Have now received my second bottle as I believe in this product!</li>
    <li> Smells good. not so sure about how effective it has really been to be honest. was pretty much tempted to try cause of all the reviews here out of which 75% are fake. but for the price i dont think i will buy again.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good...keeps hairline strong!</li>
    <li> I am 7 months pregnant. But I found that my hair lost a lot from the beginning of my pregnant, I start to keep looking a great shampoo for preventing hair loss and increase the hair volume, and this product is exactly what I am looking for!!!! Recommend to you guys!</li>
    <li> Just recently received this product and it seems wonderful already! The ingredients on the back are organic and several things that are well known to help prevent hair loss. I was skeptical at first, but after receiving this item, I&#x27;m excited to give this a try!</li>
    <li> I have been using many different shampoo but this is the best Shampoo product ever nothing can bit this product</li>
    <li> Good shapoo, adds volume. Seems like it reduced my hair loss but not completely. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for just under 3 months, and so far it seems to work okay and I have noticed some new hair growth but have not noticed a reduction in shedding. Hopefully continued use I will see better results. The smell is nice and subtle, and it seems to do a good job of cleaning hair without sulfates.</li>
    <li> I bought several hair products, and this is my favorite. Is short of time to fully judge the product as I have used it for 1 month, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I drop less hair with each wash. I&#x27;m using the product every day right now, but I think it&#x27;s safe to say this shampoo is very beneficial</li>
    <li> Smells good. don&#x27;t know if it really works yet though.</li>
    <li> I think it does work for my hair! I have used it for 2 weeks and I feel my hair is getting strong and decreasing loss! I think I will buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really decreases oily feeling of my hair without additional use of conditioner. And I think my hair loss problem is improving after using this fantastic shampoo.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Help to prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> every 6 months I buy a bottle of this shampoo . because I&#x27;m really satisfy for this product , I had fall hair, but fortunately i don&#x27;t have any fall</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product deserved the 5 stars I gave it. I recently had some pretty heavy hair loss causing my previously thick and beautiful hair to thin in the last few months. I turned to Amazon for a solution after supplements didn&#x27;t work, and I&#x27;m very grateful I made that choice. I noticed a difference within the first few washings and now a few weeks later I have normal loss and a lot more body. I am someone who believes that quality will cost a bit more, so I didn&#x27;t adjust my rating for price. Note that hair loss can have many causes so this won&#x27;t be the 100% solution for everyone, but it worked really well for me.</li>
    <li> Seems to work, I&#x27;m just starting to thin on top, but seems to slow the rate at which the follicles are dying off.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and fine.  This shampoo left it super shiny and sleek. Will definitely buy again.  I love hair products with Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> Working well so far; may take some time to see results but can stop shedding</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo, it gives volume and shine, and the smell is not bad either. I have been using it for several months now and plan to continue.</li>
    <li> Just the thought of putting top line ingrediants on my hair and scalp makes me like it. I&#x27;m almost finished withmy first bottle and must say my hair is starting to look better . Hoping this will continue!!</li>
    <li> Great organic shampoo! I love it! I love the care they take in putting all natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is hands down one of the best shampoos I have ever used.  Great ingredients, great lather, all around wonderful experience! Only possible complaint I could have is that the pump does not work as smoothly as it should.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over three weeks. I do not see a real change in the amount of hair shedding. The shampoo makes the texture of my hair a little coarser and I think that makes it feel a little fuller. I plan to try this product a few more weeks for an accurate trial period. If it doesn&#x27;t stop the shedding, then I will not reorder. In the meantime, I happy to use a shampoo with ingredients from nature.</li>
    <li> Tried this product in place of the shampoo I had been using for years. I find that it definitely adds volume to thin hair and lathers well with a single pump. I have been very happy with this product so far.</li>
    <li> Hair loss has stopped. The person who cuts my hair asked me a couple weeks ago, what was up. She held up a mirror, showed me a strip of hair growing in the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; spot in the middle of the back of my head, and said, &amp;#34;you didn&#x27;t used to have this hair here.&amp;#34; It may not work for some of you, but it works for me, with no issues (dryness, etc.).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for last one week, and seems its working. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great it has restored my hair&#x27;s thickness volume. If you are ready to throw your hat back in the closet get a bottle of Pura d&#x27;or Brown and Blue!!!</li>
    <li> It really help my protect hair lost. Good product!!</li>
    <li> Washes hair clean and has a nice smell. Leave in for 5 mins and allow for full absorbtion. Not sure the impact it has had but have grown hair in the area with a combination of other products. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I am very sad to say this product did not work for me. I thought it would stop my hair lose.  Since I have dark brown hair it is very noticeable. This product dried my hair out very much. It might of helped a bit with my hair lose but the down side of it is the sink it covered with hair breakage much more than normal.  I did use the whole bottle just to give it a fair chance.  I paired it with the matching conditioner. I will keep trying to buy the perfect product with works for myself and hair lose. This one did not. Need to really deep condition my hair.</li>
    <li> I have lost almost half of my hair due to stress for the past couple of years. I was desperate to find a way to keep and grow my hair. I have tried for several months masks with egg yolk and olive oil, and also a natural cream with petroleum in it. While I was doing this, I got this shampoo with argan oil, as the argan oil was highly recommended by my colleagues. I have been using the shampoo along with the mask. I cannot tell 100% that the argan oil shampoo is the one that helped the most, but my hair is definitely much better than before. I will continue to use all of these natural products to keep my hair healthy and beautiful.</li>
    <li> after trying numerous other brands, I&#x27;ve been using this for over six months and already have great noticeable results!</li>
    <li> I like this a lot.  You need to use a conditioner with it after shampooing.  Nice scent, not too strong.  I have less shedding when using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I began using this product about a year ago. I have always had extremely thin hair and have began to see hair loss as I age. This is the only product that I have found that leaves my hair feeling clean and full of body. I get compliments on my hair after using this shampoo where as before using, I felt as if I were trying to hide my thin areas using hairspray that didn&#x27;t get the job done. I also like the fact that this shampoo is organic and I do not have to worry about harsh chemicals that some companies add to their products. This shampoo goes a long way too. One pump is all I need. Money well spent!</li>
    <li> Been working great so far..Going to keep using it until I get the result I want..I hope it&#x27;s fast. 😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month and it seems to be working as expected. I&#x27;m seeing less hair stuck in my comb.</li>
    <li> Great product. After first use you even feel more body in your hair. Helps tremendous with hair loss. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t harsh I have been using it for my hair loss which I believe is through stress due to consistent Graduate studies.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a pretty good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve brought and used it for two weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed there&#x27;s less hair loss when combing my hair.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for three weeks. You don&#x27;t need much shamppo for mid length hair just about two pumps, so the bottle is lasting a lot longer than I thought it would at the beginning. I do like the scent- it&#x27;s very unique, pleasant and smells clean! I still am not sure if hair loss has been reduced but I will definitely give it more time.</li>
    <li> I only recently received this product.  I was looking for a shampoo without sulphate and which will help my fine and thinning hair.  Since I have only used Pura d&#x27;or a few times, the jury is still out as to how well it will help in hair growth and preventing hair loss, but I am very hopeful, and I will try to remember to leave a subsequent review in a few months.  By then I should be able to tell how well the shampoo works for me.  I like the fresh scent and the way it makes my hair feel though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo because i have been losing hair for quite some times and had try few different anti-hair loss products. turns out not so good, so i decided to switch to this organic shampoo. after just 3 weeks of use. i noticed less hairs in the shower drain. my hair does look healthier.will contirue to use it. hopefully this shampoo makes me comfortable to switch to next level purad&#x27;or anti-hair loss shampoo(gold-lablel)...</li>
    <li> Because of the offer for free shampoo if a favorable review is written, I question how accurate the reviews are.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the shampoo.  I&#x27;ve used it for almost a month washing my hair every 2 days.  Now my scalp burns and itches and my hair is dull, dry and mats easily.  The worst thing is my hair has thinned noticeably since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo for a year.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thicker when I use it. When I&#x27;ve used other shampoos in between, I go back to&lt;br /&gt; this because it just gives a fuller look to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Due to aging, I have experienced some hair-loss. Due to great reviews, that&#x27;s why I started using this shampoo. I have been using this shampoo for one year. I honestly believe that it has been working on me. I visibly saw less hair fall throughout the year &amp; my scalp is not balding as much anymore. This really boosted my confidence and I am grateful that I found this shampoo. I highly recommend that you use this or at least give it a shot. It might change your life!</li>
    <li> I bought due to using well water and being harsh on hair.  It seems to help not have hair fall out as much.  I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been using it for about a year.  I will not use another product as long as I can get my hands on this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Helped with my hair loss during the fall season. My husband also says his curly hair is much more manageable after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have always had thin hair but as I grow older it seems to be worsening.  I purchased this product in the hopes of slowing the process.  I love this shampoo.  I love the smell and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use alot as I have long hair.  This shampoo leaves my hair feeling very soft and luxuriant.  My hair is very shiny and healthy looking.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle and have been happy with the results. I tried other natural/organic shampoos and although they all washed well, I still noticed a lot of hair falling off. This shampoo does a great job cleaning as well as significantly reducing the amount of hair loss. Don&#x27;t have any complaints about it and would suggest it to anyone who is trying to keep as much hair on their head as possible.</li>
    <li> Ok, short story, Im a 43 year old male, decided to grow my hair out to a longer style last fall (from a military cut) , 8 months later IM working on some great length, I decided to get a professional coloring to hide some gray hairs. So I get colored and I make the mistake to go to a 5b thinking it looked good on the card...way to dark for me , When I was finished I was like wow thats dark, so a weak later I had the local beauty college lighten my hair then redye to a 7b and had them throw in some highlights.&lt;br /&gt;Worst mistake of the year..Im actually mad that no one warned me - so after this 4 step process all within a weak ( 2 days total) my hair has started slowly falling out, I tell people and they say it must be breakage --- nope its out by the root and thinning greatly and I have had thick hair my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;SO I sought out this product - first off I cant give any positive thumbs up to the hair retention or growth factor just yet.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that this product smells great , feels good on the scalp, lathers GREAT ( not sure why some say not) and my hair feels sooo clean.&lt;br /&gt;Only CON so far is that like others have mentioned the pump is somewhat &amp;#34;crappy&amp;#34;, its not a smooth pump up and down, on the second pump, you have to manually pull up to reset - if that makes sense.  BTW - you really only need to small pumps, if you use more its just more.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if I can tell of added growth /retention results. As of 2 weeks I still have much shedding ...Im also taking Biotin and using castor oil/coconut oil hot oil treatments</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for the last one year and it really works! Without doubt the best natural shampoo on the market so far!!</li>
    <li> Great product, natural, smells good and it works</li>
    <li> A little early to tell.  However, I like using it.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair extremely moisturized! However, the scent could be a tad improved.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m very concerned about my hair health and while I do not suffer from true hair loss, ever since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I only lose a max of ten hairs in the shower. My hair is now noticeably healthier and softer. I only wash my hair once a week, but it seems that more frequent use might weigh down and flatten hair. Still, this is my go-to shampoo!</li>
    <li> its very good for me!</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for two month. Hair loss seems to be reduced, definitely not worse than before... will keep using it and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a little pricy though.</li>
    <li> great product - great smell  and works!</li>
    <li> So far so good. My hair never feels dry or oily afterwards. Hair feels healthy and and full.</li>
    <li> I have noticed I lost more hair!</li>
    <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t leave my hair as easy to comb out as other products I have used, so I mentioned to my Son that he could have it.  A few days later when he visited and reminded me, I gave it to him BUT sure didn&#x27;t want to because by then I noticed that my hair was fluffier and had volume like it had when I was much younger.  This happened in just a few days!  So, I am ordering more!  I love the way my hair looks!</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo, I think it may have slowed down the hair loss a little bit, and it certainly hasn&#x27;t gotten worse.  I&#x27;ve noticed some small hairs starting to grow in.  Overall I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant when I first ordered this product.  I didn&#x27;t believe the claims that it would prevent hair loss, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.  I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised, and I have recommended this shampoo and conditioner to others.  I have definitely noticed less hair in my shower drain, and I have received several compliments from people who say that my hair looks healthier and thicker.  My hair dresser has also noticed less breakage, and she said that my hair feels much healthier than before  I will absolutely continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is decent in maintaining your hair, I also noticed less hair loss after using it. I recommend this for people who just need to manage their hair loss</li>
    <li> i got this product and this is AMAZING. since school i always had thickness hair and spot without hair and i can see the difference 100%. Thank you so much to this company of Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention</li>
    <li> It is amazing!!!!! My hair&#x27;s volume has increased nd my roots are healthy</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have used several expensive shampoos in the past and all of them had their pros and cons but this shampoo is the only shampoo that can be used by the entire family. Makes your hair look fuller and thicker (not oily), no more dandruff or itching. I&#x27;m glad this product is available on Amazon. As I wrote before I had tried quite a few products and been to quite a few places and never seen or used a product of this quality.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s useful, i like it,good ,it&#x27;s well to smells!</li>
    <li> Within two weeks I&#x27;ve already noticed the difference.  My hair is more full and thick.  100% recommend</li>
    <li> We bought it because it seems natural and it helps prevent hair loss as advertised. After a couple weeks of using it, I do notice my hair loss issue has improved, and I&#x27;m getting less dandruff.  Overall, we&#x27;re happy with the product. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a four star is due top its fragrance, which is not to my taste.</li>
    <li> I used the shampoo for hair fall and dryness of hair. My hair became softer in two to three washes and I noticed a significant reduction in hair fall by four weeks of using the product. Using it in combination with argan oil gives better results.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I have used it three times thus far and very pleased with the product.  I have noticed less hair loss, more volume, and a good feel to my hair.  My scalp is not itchy and my hair color more vibrant!</li>
    <li> Very good product, recommend to everyone who is struggling with hair loss. It makes your hair smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo. Cleanses well and makes my hair feel thick. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but when you use organic ingredients you can&#x27;t expect the perfume smells. I would rather have a product that works and this one does.</li>
    <li> Overall i think this is a great product. All the ingredients are great for hair. I have been using this daily for 5 days and my hair feels great. It does seem a little dry but that could be because of the water. I intend to rebuy this product going forward.</li>
    <li> It is a prefect product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this for several months now. Mostly for hair loss properties. I believe it is helping because I&#x27;m noticing less hair in my drain. Its organic and makes my hair feel healthier all around. Much cheaper than Wen and does the same things :)</li>
    <li> This hair shampoo is the most expensive shampoo that I have ever used. I just wanna give it a try since my hair keeps losing. Luckily, it didn&#x27;t let me down. My hair stops losing gradually and some new hair begins to grow out from where it was bald and becomes a little bit thick. What a great change! I really like the change this shampoo brings to me. It&#x27;s a little bit expensive among the shampoo products. I wish they will have more promotions for this product so it can be affordable to more people.</li>
    <li> I noticed some improvements  after only two washes on my hair .I noticed improvement because my hair is not falling as before...still losing hair but not as before.</li>
    <li> First time using this product and bought another bottle. Smell is pleasant and makes my hairs voluminous. Does well for an organic shampoo and price is fair</li>
    <li> Have only been using for a week. Makes my hair tingle and less oily. Hair is more dry though. Hair appears to be fuller.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not as good as I expected. My wife uses this product. At the first time I use it, her hair still lost that much after showering. But after a few months use, the hair loss seems reduced. But it didn&#x27;t have the function to help growth of the hair.</li>
    <li> The effect of this product is visible, I do have a less hair loss, but I will like it more if it could be smelt better........</li>
    <li> Not recommended. After 6 times washing my hair with this shampoo and following instructions I can&#x27;t see any improvement in hair loss and it is extremely drying to the scalp. I am discontinuing use.  Smells like eucalyptus.</li>
    <li> great product. I used it once only since I bought it but I feel my hair are manageable and I saw less hair in my bathtub.</li>
    <li> This the BEST hair product I have ever used. I have been using this shampoo for A while now and I really like this shampoo. Within in a week and a half of using this product I have experienced a tremendous shed of my hair. My hair loss has slowed down significantly. I used to see hair everywhere in my house and it was horrifying to see how much hair I lost each day. After using this product for a few months the hair loss reduced about 70%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to my friends. They have started using this product and they were very happy with the product. I strongly recommend this product to all my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Pura D&#x27;or - Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this product when i was looking for a natural organic shampoo. I&#x27;ve used various other shampoos with not much help to my hair fall problem...and finally just decided to go with a all natural shampoo, thinking at least it wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair further. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now, and happy to report that hairfall has reduced to a great extent. It&#x27;s not stopped completely, but i can tell that there are fewer strands of hair fallen after a shower vs before using this shampoo. I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic hair growth or anything...but i will continue to use this product and update if i see any other positive results.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair soft and less hair falls out. There&#x27;s also a tingly feeling afterwards on the scalp.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell, no lather, completetly unmanagable frizzy results, must be chemically based since it removes color and enhances hair loss.  Not as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I tried everything but this surprisingly worked for me. This really helped me with hair loss.</li>
    <li> You FEEL the difference between this organic shampoo and others that you buy at the store.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo everytime I need to wash my hair. I used to have an itchy scalp before with my old shampoo. But now, I am free from itchiness. I figured out this shampoo has hair-friendly ingredients. I love the nice rich foamy lather it has on my hair. I feel that it really moisturizes my scalp and helped so well in improving the texture of my hair. My hair has been manageable that ever even in during summertime. I have to purchase another bottle because I&#x27;m running out of it. Definitely a favorite bathroom item!</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo daily for a month and have been amazed at how quickly I&#x27;ve noticed my hair appearing thicker.  My hair has been thinning for years, (I&#x27;m 37) I have tried all of the different hair loss products from Rogaine to herbal supplements to shampoos claiming to thicken, or prevent further hair loss - This is the product I recommend.  I have finally found the right shampoo for me after all this years looking, technology has caught up, and this little bottle has all the magical ingredients.  My hair loss anxiety has disappeared. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo along with a laser comb, and I&#x27;m feeling confident about  keeping the hair on my head and maybe in the future, seeing some hair come back? who knows, we&#x27;ll  see.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo against hair loss. My hair has taken some abuse from styling products and looking at the ingredients, I wanted to try it since some of the ingredients were similar to the vitamin supplements I take. The scent is nice, it feels somewhat conditioning. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp but I still end up with some hair in the drain, I have noticed shinier hair with a bit more resilience to breakage. good product!! I still want to try it for few more months for some hopeful result against hair loss.</li>
    <li> I just got this shampoo and tried it for the first time. My hair feels great and it smells nice. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love the tingle it has when in your hair! It is a very nice shampoo so far. I have only used it a few times, but so far it has made my hair appear fuller. I can&#x27;t wait to review this product again in a few months!</li>
    <li> I have lost all of my hair after an electric shock. It was a shocking story in my life. When I remember the story, it gives me a bad feeling. Now, I want to get back my hair again. But, all of my friends said that it’s not possible, and then my doctor said it will be possible only if I consider a surgery. But, I had not enough money for an expensive surgery. So, I was very depressed. One day, my wife brought the shampoo for me. It looked very common, but after using one and a half months, I started to get the result. Now, I’m happy as I’ve already got some hair on my head, which changed the look of my face. I would love to continue to get my hair back. Thanks Pura d&#x27;or for giving me the new hair and life!</li>
    <li> I like it so far! My only gripe is the smell and my hair feels dry if I use it without conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Every time I shampooed with other products (high quality shampoos) , I lost a lot of hair.  It was very scary.  From the first time I used this shampoo, my hair has stopped falling out and has started thickening again.  I will never use anything but organic shampoo again.  I have gotten many friends and family members using this shampoo now and they all love the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years as another step to prevent hair loss.  I&#x27;m happy with the results!  One bottle lasts quite a long time since you can easily manage your usage thanks to the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels clean afterwards, and there is no perfumed smell; which is good in my book.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss prevention Premium for about 2 mouths. So far I love this product because it makes my hair looks more volume and shiner. I have very unhealthy and thin hair, adding to that my scalp is very sensitive.  With that said, I am very particular about shampoo.  I was using Phytoworx which worked well with my hair, but at one point it was too costly that I couldn&#x27;t afford it, and so I ended up using this product.  I was skeptical at first.  However, after the fifth time use, i start to notice the difference of hair specially when I combine it with pura d&#x27;or Argain oil conditioner.  Every time after using this product, i can not help, but to touch my hair to feel weight and the smoothness of it. By the way, the conditioner does leave your hair a calm aroma.  I will definitely continue using it and hopefully the price does not go up as its market is bigger.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is mild unlike lot of other shampoos in the market which comes with heavy chemicals. I have used lot of shampoos and this one is definitely recommended for folks who are looking for natural hair fall prevention shampoos. I can clearly notice that my dandruff got reduced after 3 weeks of usage.</li>
    <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a long time .  It did wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this brand.  The only thing they should change is to make the writing bigger for the different types, i.e, I bought by mistake the &amp;#34;Hair Loss Prevention&amp;#34; instead of the &amp;#34;Gray Hair&amp;#34; one this time.  I&#x27;m going to use it anyway though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for roughly a year now. People don&#x27;t consider what chemicals are absorbed into the body by products like shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. This shampoo has clean ingredients, and leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy. I don&#x27;t know if it has prevented any hair loss, but I can say that my husband just made it to 30 with a full head of hair, and using this shampoo over the course of this last year certainly couldn&#x27;t have hurt.</li>
    <li> This shampoo should be used with the conditioner one without the other defeats the purpose.  I notice I have hardly any fallout after using this product for two weeks.  Finally found a shampoo/conditioner&lt;br /&gt;that works!</li>
    <li> The product begins to work within the first 2 weeks I would say. The scent of this product is a lemon scent not the best type of scent but being all natural you can complain. The price of the product is decent with the size of the bottle. Leaves hair much much thicker than ever before. It you have ever done your research you know that most of the ingredients in the product help with hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is an amazingly good shampoo for anyone experiencing hair loss. I&#x27;ve seen a difference after just a few washes with less hair fall and breakage with my hair and It smells good, lathers properly. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Argan oil shampoo. It is very thick and creamy feeling. It does not lather as easily as other shampoos but it makes my scalp feel nice, and help manage my shedding.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist and I have some clients that have thinning hair due to taking meds for cancer and also some that are losing hair because of stress. From the first try my clients have noticed the change in their hair. It has brought back thickness and stopped the hair from falling off.  I have been very impressed with this shampoo and highly recommend its use!</li>
    <li> The product thickens hair a bit, but it&#x27;s not overly apparent. But your hair gets clean.</li>
    <li> Just received it, don&#x27;t know if it actually works. It smells all right, and the shipping is fast.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I can feel my hair growing</li>
    <li> This product is great! I have been using it for about 3 months now and am definitely seeing positive results. I absolutely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 2 months. I like the subtle and mild aroma of the shampoo. I also like the amount of the lather that is produced by a single pump of the shampoo. It definitely seems to make my hair feel fuller and thicker after use. I also don&#x27;t seem to have any hair fall out while shampooing although, I didn&#x27;t have a major problem with hair falling out. It is difficult for me to determine at this point whether it has helped me grow any hair back during the last two months. I think that I will have to use it longer than I have to noticeably see hair growth.  I will update this review after 6 months or so of use in regards to hair growth. Overall I do like this shampoo and plan to continue purchasing it if for nothing other than having far fewer chemicals than other shampoos I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or  Hair prevention organic shampoo as worked wonders  for my hair ,  I have only used this product for a month and I have seen results  with less hair falling then before i started using this product and  it makes your hair feel soft  and rich , over all I have given this product a 4 star rating and I think  most people who are  experiencing premature hair loss should absolutely give this product a chance!</li>
    <li> After losing my hair through chemo, it grew back, but it was noticably thin on the top.  As I was looking for products to help me with my thinning hair, I saw this product referred to in several reviews.  I figured I would try it and see it if would help.  And, it did.  I did not use any other product in my hair and noticed that my hair was fuller.  It is not a miracle shampoo, so don&#x27;t expect dramatic results.  But, I could tell a difference and so far, it&#x27;s the best that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great Product. My hair is looking sexier already.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a bit before I gave this a review because I really wanted to give it some time to work. However I can not wait any longer. THe smell of the shampoo is so delightful. It gives you a fresh tingly feeling while you are washing your hair and my hair is soft shiny and manageable. I will have to check back soon and let you know if I see less hair falling out, but so far, I would buy this just for what it is, organic shampoo.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and having been using this shampoo almost daily. I have also been taking saw palmetto supplements. After about 2 weeks I am starting to see new hairs growing in on my receding hairline. I am very happy with my purchase and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times, but it is a very mild, comfortable shampoo.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mom, I hope it will help her.</li>
    <li> This product has helped strengthen my hair. The tea tree oil in the product makes your hair free fresh and tingly. I also like that all the ingredients are natural. I use the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> I saw immediate results after 1st wash. Hair still falls, but no as much!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo for 3 weeks now, the smell of the shampoo is very pleasant not medicinal at all, it foams nicely, my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch after using it, and my hair is nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine and thin hair, concerning the hair loss, it&#x27;s too early to tell, but I will continue using it to see an improvement.</li>
    <li> I love it. It smells good and it seems really worked. I think I will continue to buy it. And will also recommend to my friend. yeah.</li>
    <li> Feeling good! Need more time to check out the loss prevention but now its good enough.</li>
    <li> It feels good so far. I feel my hair drop less than before. I will keep trying it.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo. all organic ingredients. Should be in a better position after some more weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for three weeks and i noticed less hair falling out each time and it has very fresh scent which makes it even better. i would recommend this shampoo highly.</li>
    <li> The touch is smooth and soft after use, easy to wash out, I like it,  highly recommended to all of other.</li>
    <li> I am  a little disappointed. Unlike the tranquility shampoo this one seems to make my hair dry and a little itchy. looks like  it strips the  body I built up with tranquility shampoo. I will use a few more times and see it it is good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 days, and so far, so good. Didn&#x27;t expect a miracle after only a few days of use, but it has been leaving my hair feeling cleaner and thicker than my former shampoo. It also gives my scalp a nice little tingle as it works its magic (instructions say to leave in for 2 minutes), and hopefully that magic will be fewer and fewer hairs being shed. For now, I&#x27;m enjoying the organic ingredients and the way it makes my hair feel after I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finding this shampoo makes it hard to get a comb through my hair and I&#x27;m loosing a lot of hair in the process. I don&#x27;t like using conditioner every time I wash my hair but I think you have to with this shampoo to be able to comb your hair more easily and put less strain on your hair in the process.</li>
    <li> I give it a 5 star because the product does what it claims: helps prevent hair loss and promotes regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried so many things before, from propecia (which works but has side effects...) to Rogaine.  This shampoo has boosted my hair count. Not only I noticed, but my GF has commented on how much my hair has been growing back.  I strongly recommend giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;This is how I use it: As soon as I jump into the shower I massage my head with it and let it stand for 5 mins until I rinse it at the very end. Hope it works for you!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work in the slightest sense and have been using it for 6 months. Matter of fact my hair loss became worse. A bunch of fake reviews online. I demand a full refund for this garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months. I have noticed that at the 1st month my scalp was dry and itchy so I started using Selson Blue once a week and Pura d&#x27;or the other six (Dry scalp gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was using just Rogaine I was shedding about 10-12 hairs a shower. 2 months later this shampoo combined with Rogaine, Microneedling, and Biotin pills I&#x27;ve noticed I only shed about 5-7 when i shower. I don&#x27;t know which one of them it is or if it&#x27;s a combination but I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 because I can&#x27;t prove it&#x27;s just due to this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was loosing so much hair , I went to the dermatologist she siad it was a change of hormons, i tried so many products, but this shampoo really helped me , no more hair on my pillow , less hair falls down when i shower , it ahs reduced my hair loss 70% , I am very happy now. I was so worried before , I am 35 years old not ready to use wigs yet lol</li>
    <li> Shampoo is good to fight against hair loss. The only problem I´m having is that it leaves my skin a bit dry</li>
    <li> I have ordered my second bottle and the Pura d&#x27;or Hair loss prevention premium shampoo has made a difference in the thickness of my hair and the hair is easier to manager. I recommend this product and will continue to use in the future and maybe will try one of the other products. I am 63 years old and this product gives me some hope for keeping hair not losing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;  I like the way my hair feels after shampooing with this product.</li>
    <li> Love the look of the product. Smells similar to Pine Sol, which I have become fond of. I have been using about a month and I would have to say my hair looks healthier and fuller. Overall I wish I had been using this shampoo sooner.</li>
    <li> My hair feels softer and smells great. I will have to use it for a while to say anything about hair loss as I just recieved it. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Seems good, smells like tea or food, can&#x27;t yet tell. Too early to know what it does for hair growth, but it does lather, and does seem to clean, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, just used it today and my hair was much more manageable with my hair product</li>
    <li> goof for hair loss people</li>
    <li> so far feels amazing and ive had less hair loss while using it</li>
    <li> This shampoo is flaky. It leaves dandruff if you don&#x27;t shower every day. I missed showering for two days coz I was travelling. One third my scalp was flaking. Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about a week and like the way my hair feels and looks.  Hoping to hold onto my existing hair, and looking forward to new hair growth.  I was previously using Pantene with both shampoo and conditioner in one.  I like this product much better and it is natural.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo and conditioner. My husband has been using this product since last year. He had been looking for a product to help him reduce his hair loss. He loves it! He has noticed a huge difference. I started using it a few weeks ago and have noticed a difference in how my hair looks and feels. Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> This product is great! I find that it dries my hair a bit, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing for me. Considering I have very soft fine hair, usually like it to have more of a texture. I find it best when I alternate between this and another hair shampoo. Definitely noticed a difference within a day of using it! Will definitely continue to use it and if all is well will become a returning customer. Recommend that you try it for yourself!</li>
    <li> I just received this product and used once only. It makes my hair looking full and very sleek. However, I noticed that it may also wash off my hair dye.  It is my concern and I will give it one more try.  I will update my feedback later.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, fair pricing and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Used a couple times and felt that it might be good for hair but not very sure since some other products have been used as well.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized that I have hair loss problem two weeks ago, so I ordered this product. Amazing thing happened after I used it for one week! My hair became stronger, and you can tell it looks healthier. I love it, i am still using it &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair loss problem, I highly recommend you to use this shampoo, it really helps!</li>
    <li> Not a good product, it&#x27;s not useful because my hair still dropping after using it for a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to the whole organic hair and skin product thing and so I was a bit hesitant and had low expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised after using the shampoo for two weeks.  It lathers well, cleans well and leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I feel it could have a better scent.  There really isn&#x27;t any scent, so it&#x27;s not bad. I just feel it could be improved by a more floral scent,but maybe that&#x27;s part of the whole organic thing.  I love everything else about the Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and can&#x27;t tell for certain if it is making my hair thicker or not (it seems a bit more but I may just be telling myself that).  One thing that I noticed immediately is that I no longer have flakes in my hair.  I had tried all of the name brand dandruff shampoos and none of them worked.  Ever since switching to this I have had no more flaking so this was a bonus in and of itself.  I will continue using this product for this reason along and and hopefully over time the hair starts coming back in full force!</li>
    <li> Just start to use this product. Feel comfortable and refreshed after use. May need more time to see the hair loss prevention effect.</li>
    <li> I just got this product last week and I love the fact that this product has all natural ingredients! I am really excited to see the results! I can already see my hair is softer.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  My hair was falling out abnormally fast when I was using just a grocery store brand.  I decided to purchase this and it was a vast difference.  After I wash my hair, my scalp feels soothed, tingly, fresh and clean.  I also happen to love the smell of tea tree oil, so that was a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair I see washed out in my bathtub seems like a normal amount now, and in general my hair just looks and feels so much fresher and stronger.  I am not sure whether it helps with regrowth, though the ingredients are thought to promote regrowth.  I am also taking biotin because many other reviewers have noted that has helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give 4 stars, because while I am unsure whether it really causes regrowth, it definitely has limited my hair loss and I love the clean, revitalized feel and look of my hair after each shower.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> My hair feels like I stuck my head in a can of lard</li>
    <li> me and wife use it and it seems fine.  wife said she stop losing hair and for me as well  Does it regrown hair, not too noticeably, but maybe it serve it purpose of slowing down or stop the hair loss process</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve previously bought other Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Shampoos, including the Gold Version, but this last one was pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;It has a weird smell, resembling chlorine to a small degree and made me question whether I should use still it. Sometimes I think it&#x27;s a strategy employed by the company to force people to buy the more expensive gold version, but it&#x27;s just a speculation, so treat it as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As fair as the hair loss efficacy, I can&#x27;t say whether this shampoo is effective or damaging, as I have not lost nor gained any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> The shampoo replaced my Nixon system 6 shampoo. The first thing I immediately noticed was after washing my hair, it felt very thick. Almost to the point where it felt like it was clumping together. It isn&#x27;t a detractor but definitely something worth mentioning. After a month of using this I can say that I find less hair in the sink compared to the Nixon but not by much. The smell is great; a very light mint fragrance. I feel it is still too early to say if I will enjoy this product long term but so far I like it. 4 stars because of price, and while my hair feels fuller, it also feels less soft.</li>
    <li> Its not going to regrow your hair.  If it did it would be about $5,000 a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that it is free of a lot of crap in other cheaper shampoos and left my scalp feeling refreshed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;It should probably be priced around $15 rather than $25.</li>
    <li> This is a very great product. It truly works. When I first bought it, I was doubtful because I have tried several different products. Now I am very happy I decided to buy it. Anyone who is loosing hair, buy it! You wont be disappointed. Great product.</li>
    <li> After a couple of weeks I have started to notice less hair falling out! I have little baby hairs growing in as well. I have tried several products over the last two years for my hair loss, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> Smells  wonderful and makes lots of suds. It also leaves my hair very shiny and smooth, I will be using this shampoo from now on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 months. I can&#x27;t tell if this is thinning my hair or it was going that way anyway. It could have been worse without it too, but the ingredients make sense. The coconut derived stuff is better than the lauryl stuff?</li>
    <li> Before using this product my hair would be all over my back after a shower. Just after the first try I only lost a few hairs. I showed my dear friend how I could run my fingers through my hair and no hair would out. Pros: it truly works! Cons: it takes about 20 seconds to work it into a lather and it seems to cause my scalp to itch a little for a brief spell. However, I have a sensitive scalp to begin with. Also it has a little bit of an odd smell but it seems to dissipate quickly when dry. My final vote: \\&quot;A Strong Buy\\&quot;!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079R6BD2/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> No or less effect on my hair</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo for a couple of months.  My daughter did some research for the best product to use and ordered this shampoo.  She gave me a bottle and after using all of it I knew I needed to order more.  My hair feels cleaner and softer.  The main reason was because of my hair loss and that has improved 100%.  This is one product I will continue to use.  Anything else I have tried does not compare to Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past 4 months. My hair loss has certainly reduced esp by last month. My hair also feels stronger and I feel prolonged use of this shampoo will minimize my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for a little while &amp; saw great results, minimum hair loss. Then I stopped &amp; tried another brand claiming the same benefits ,within 2 washes I was losing a ton of hair again. So I&#x27;m back using this shampoo &amp; once again amazing results. I highly recommend this shampoo &amp; conditioner it works great &amp; smells great.</li>
    <li> Okay, do not feel any changes</li>
    <li> 2 stars for now... I MAY change later if results change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell&#x27;s pretty good. Lathers fine. Feels fresh after rinse.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this in every other day in combination with another product, provia. I started May 17 of this year with a shaved head. Hop in the shower, get wet, apply the shampoo first and leave it in while I wash everything else. I&#x27;m guessing it soaks in for a good 5 minutes. Every other day I take a picture. I&#x27;ll give it a year and share the pictures... So far, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helping. I&#x27;ve cut my hair 3 times  trying to level things out... keep the normal hair from outgrowing the shorter area. The first 2 trims didn&#x27;t look like there was any change. Cut #3 the hair is a bit longer and there may be more coverage... but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may still be hope. We&#x27;re not even at 2 months. Will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> The cap of the bottle was not tight.  The sticky liquid was leaking outside of the bottle, but it is within the shrink plastic package.</li>
    <li> This is a legitimate review.  If you are like me you have thinning, flat, dull hair that gets greasy within a day or two. Im a female in my late twenties and that is not normal, especially when I used to have healthy hair. I have tried so mamy thickening shampoos and conditioners out there and while very few made a difference, the end result was always the same: My hair will get bored with the product and go back to its flat, thin and damaged state. No matter how much I trim or cut and it would leave me with insane embarassing dandruff.  While I&#x27;ve only been using this product for the past month, it is the ONLY product that gave me significant results. It didnt regrow my hair, of course, its not magic, BUT it made my hair look and feel healthier, gave it more volume AND what made my heart swell was that recently Ive even gotten natural curls back, curls that I havent seen since almost high school.  I hope and pray that it continues to improve my hair back to normacy and that my hair doesnt &amp;#34;relapse&amp;#34; like it has with many other products. I cant say that its the absolute best but I can tell you Ive tried a lot and this is the best thus far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m excited about this shampoo.  In all honesty, it takes a long time to tell whether it will prevent hair loss or promote fresh growth.  It seems like it will based on the tingly sensation on my couch.  The real benefit is that with the argon oil it is really good for my hair and I don&#x27;t have to load it up with so many products to prevent frizz.  That right there will prevent hair loss.  I know some people said it&#x27;s expensive but I don&#x27;t think so.  It lasts a long time and what better to invest in but your hair?</li>
    <li> So far, this is the best shampoo I have found that combats excessive shedding due to PCOS hair loss. My hair was coming out in clumps and I was suffering major breakage issues. My hair isn&#x27;t falling out nearly as much and I think after 3 months I am starting to see some regrowth.</li>
    <li> so far it has been good , my hair feels clean .however I haven&#x27;t seen any re growth .</li>
    <li> Honestly? i&#x27;ve seen great results with this shampoo &amp; conditioner, it has been featured in a lot of magazines! and it&#x27;s def. very healthy for your hair, as it is organic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;sWdxFBlAfJ4</li>
    <li> This product helped make my hair feel thicker. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I makes me believe I a helping my hair. It is all in the mind.</li>
    <li> This is the third bottle I am on. I know I will always use this shampoo due to the fact it is natural with no harsh chemicals.  My hair stopped shedding the way it used to  and it&#x27;s growing a lot quicker than before. Also, gives it a shine and it feels healthier. My hair is fine but when using this product the strands feel thicker, more volume to it. I highly recommend it and have told family members about it.</li>
    <li> It works wonders instantly and in an alot more natural way then I thought. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has gotten alot thicker and healthier, and I now I don&#x27;t see my scalp when looking at my head. I would recommend this for everybody who is in search of healthy, more natural hair or suffering from hair loss.</li>
    <li> After many years of thyroid inspired hair loss I feel I have tried everything on the planet. While I am not sure about actual growth I have a noticeable difference in thickness, so much so that others even notice. The shampoo does not smell funny or have harsh chemicals. The only teeny tiny drawback is the consistency is a little different. But it still lathers up well. For the price this is an excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a great organic alternative with a wonderful and soothing smell. I have been using the product for a few weeks and notice subtle differences including fuller and softer hair. Time will tell if the product really works, but if I continue on a consistent daily usage process, it should be fine. One thing I do notice is that there is a semi-oily feel after using the shampoo so I use a conditioner after going through the first wash. The shampoo is expensive but in line with other organic products. Each bottle should last about two months depending on how many pumps you use. Overall, a great product and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I took a 30 day before and after picture and noticed a huge difference.  My barber also noticed a difference, the hair growth was thicker and was faster than normal.  I used this a long with pura d&#x27;or conditioner and Biotin supplement.  Will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Just finished the entire bottle as of today, and I am happy to report that it does work!!! When I first switched the shampoo, I found my hair was dryer after my normal wash. I don&#x27;t always use conditioner; however, with his shampoo I do, but only with a very little amount. This shampoo did indeed boost the volume of my hair, and I noticed my hair has fallen out less after each brush. Overall, quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> so far I am impressed!  I am a middle aged woman who has thinning hair, which I also color on a regular basis.  This shampoo has given me body, makes my hair and scalp feel real clean, and has added some fullness to the hair shaft.  I also noticed less breakage and less hair in the brush.  I think I will continue to use the product and am hopeful the longer I use it the better the results.  Thank you for this unique product.</li>
    <li> I do think this is helping my hair falling out, does make your hair feel stripped and course</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention: Premium Organic Shampoo  really  good product  its  really work  on my hair  (asian indian) smell  really good to</li>
    <li> Been using this for 2 months now. Hair has stopped falling out but does not regrow any previously lost hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo neither amazed me or disappointed me.  I do feel as though my hair loss has slowed and I have had some regrowth, but I am also using a hair loss supplement so it is hard to distinguish which product is working.</li>
    <li> I used twice. I do feel it works better than a regular supermarket shampoo, but still losing lots hair during shampooing. I will continue using to see a better result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 1 month now, and have seen some results. As most people have noted, it definitely cuts down on shedding.  After my daily wash, I only notice a few hairs on my hands, whereas before it would have been dozens.  The shampoo smells good, and now leaves my hair softer and fuller feeling.  I have gotten a lot of comments recently on how good my hair looks.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helped regrow any hair.  I&#x27;m one of those that never wants to look at my bald spot.  Here&#x27;s to hoping.</li>
    <li> The Pura d&#x27;or sold by HASSLE-FREE has a base of a gummy texture at the bottom of the shampoo bottle.  Probably 30% of the shampoo is unusable.  That is the reason I am giving it a 1 star.  I have not had this experience with any other product purchased at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Using for about a month, great product ... fully satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually the wife writing this review. Love the product since I do see how effective it is. I have very thin and fine hair, after about 1 month usage I sense that my hair has gotten a bit thicker. Also,  I feel that it does boost hair growth. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to 4 of my close friends plus my mom. The smell, as other reviewers have mentioned, isn&#x27;t the greatest; but, hey it works! And that&#x27;s all that matters!&lt;br /&gt;This is the third product I&#x27;ve used from Pura&#x27;dor along with their Argan Oil and Rose Hip Seed Oil...love them all, no complaints. I&#x27;m a believer and supporter of this brand. Please keep those product lines going and don&#x27;t bump the price up a lot. Thank you!</li>

    <li> My girlfriend loved it.</li>
    <li> I am very frustrated, I used a lot of natural, commercial, overpriced and expensive products in my life, products including saw palmetto and argan oil... And none of them worked satisfactorily, if some results appeared, they were dissapointing.  ______________________________________________________________________________________________  So I tryed another treatment and bought two bottles of Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo. 90% of positive reviews, good price, large bottle. But somehow, it speeded the dying process of my hair, resulting in a bathtub with 100+ hair. I thought it is normal like all minoxidil products but another indicator was extreme thinning of my hair after each use of this product. The hair also clumped together resulting in bald spots on my head. Another reviewers noted, they recieved with this pruduct a paper which prompted buyers to 5* rating on amazon, after completing it, they would recieve free bottle. None paper appeared in my order. I am going to return to my best treatment with competition products.  For me it is controversial product based on phrase \\&quot;what you need is what they sellin&#x27;\\&quot; (No shelter). I envy people, who can positively see results. I donť know what do I do with the second bottle...</li>
    <li> This shampoo is totally amazing, I really liked the texture it gave my hair, increased volume and thicker hair!  Finally found the perfect one that my hair is happy with, and me too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention shampoo for one month now. I love the way my hair looks and feels now. Notice less hair in my drain too.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo in august after reading about all the bad chemicals in grocery store shampoos and how they can exacerbate hair loss. I initially bought it for my boyfriend because his hair has begun to thin quite noticeably around the crown, and we have been trying to tackle that from every angle between diet, shampoo, minoxidil, vitamins, etc. I decided to order one for myself as well, and the matching conditioner. I&#x27;m so glad I did! The bottle will last for months, a squirt or two of this is so thick and rich it lathers my entire waist length unruly hair. You can feel it working on your scalp, it sorta tingles a little in a nice refreshing way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve personally noticed that my hair is much thicker. I&#x27;m no longer losing 4-5 handfuls per shower. Several people have commented on how my hair has been looking these past few months. It&#x27;s December now and I still haven&#x27;t used the whole bottle, so it&#x27;s actually a great price for how long it lasts. I definitely recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a couple days and so far it seems as though there is less hair in the drain!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like so far is that my hair feels really dry.  I love the smell and that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> Smells ok. Noticed less hair falling out in the shower. I will say that it makes my scalp very dry, even though I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair every day. Will update the review when I&#x27;ve had more time with the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention premium organic shampoo for four months. I don&#x27;t see the difference. I still loss lot of hairs.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. My hair feels stronger and thicker. It is even softer. The smell of the natural ingredients especially the tea tree oil let you know it is working on your scalp. This shampoo is for all types of hair and especially those looking for thicker hair with more volume. Also the shampoo feels as though it lasts for ever because you do no have to use much. Definitely worth the buy and to check out as a first timer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I am a barber. Over 80 of men suffer from some sort of thinning or balding so don&#x27;t worry. There are things people can do to prolong the ultimate result. You don&#x27;t want to use any harsh shampoo products, especially if you wash your hair daily. This product has good ingredients and still gives a nice clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Both my husband I use this shampoo. We loved it. It smells good, hairs feels silky and softer. Also noticed less hair loss after 1 week use. I would definitely recommend this shampoo!!!</li>
    <li> Just got the bottle will be updating as the weeks&lt;br /&gt;go by. Seems their might alot of fake reviews so I want their to be a real one on here for others to trust. I have thinning temples and been losing hair since I was 19. I am 25 now and can no longer hide it. I have a full thick hair but damn near bald spots on my temples. I read the ingredients and hopeing it works. Im not taking any medications or anything else for my hair. No vitamins either. I am however taking acv (apple cider vinegar). I havent seen a difference with taking that so I dont think it would be a factor if this product works for me or not. First wash doesn&#x27;t smell terribly bad. I cant smell it in my hair after a wash. The lather is good. Ive tried other natural shampoos and the lather sucks. I had been usint baby shampoo Johnson and Johnson brand new formula. This shampoo feels way better. Did not leave my hair dry even after i blew dry it.(I know bad for hair). Another thing I liked was it didn&#x27;t leave my hair all sqeaky like other shampoos. I used hot water at first than cold cold water on mu hair right back before I get out. I think a good rinse is wise. For now im basing the star review on the shampoo lather experience which is good solid shampoo.</li>
    <li> I got this product as I started notice my hair shedding way more than it used to , I tried other brands as well for same purpose , nothing really came close to this , I highly recommend this product along with Biotin tablets.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works for female hair loss. I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 months now (since I first noticed my problem) (apparently female hormonal/menopause related) and my hair has been growing back in fuller ever since. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was experiencing severe hair lost after the birth of my second child.  After just one wash the next morning I noticed a lot less hair coming off during my brushing.  I have been using the produce since and I am happy to say my hair lost problem seems to be resolved.  So happy to have this product.  It would be nice if a companion conditioner is offered as well.</li>
    <li> Takes significantly less to shampoo hair and makes it stronger &amp; thicker, this is amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks and I have noticed a difference in the hair fall.  I would recommend giving it a try if you are experiencing hair loss.  The shampoo smells good and tingles on my scalp.  Will keep using it!</li>
    <li> love this shampoo it does help</li>
    <li> I just got this today and I am already seeing the difference on first use. it feels smooth and my hair looks shiny. Optimistic that this will end my long time search for a good organic natural shampoo. Recommended.!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this over a year, everyday, I have to say this is awesome. It definitely helps in hair loss prevention.</li>
    <li> Looking for something to address hair loss after pregnancy while BF, not sure if this was relevant, but gave it a try. Have been using it for about a month now. Hard to say if it&#x27;s made a huge difference, still loosing some hair, but it seems to be slowing down. Also cut it shorter so it&#x27;s easier to comb out, was very long originally. Shampoo leaves hair clean, and scalp seems a less dry then before which is probably good. Hopefully this makes the biggest difference at the roots. Thought I might be able to get away w/o any conditioner, but hair is still tangled after showering and that caused it to pull out when brushing it so I am still using a small amount of my original conditioner. Overall seems like a decent product. Will continue using it for a while to see how it works in the long run.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long but I already see a difference in my hair- fuller, squeaky clean, fewer strands in the shower. My only regret is not having discovered this shampoo a long time ago.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a good shampoo. It is organic and doesn&#x27;t have the harmful chemicals of some other brands. It leaves my hair feeling clean and fresh. However, it is not a miracle product and doesn&#x27;t re-grow hair by itself. As part of a long-term, multi-product strategy I am sure it will help reduce hair loss and/or re-grow hair but don&#x27;t expect results in a week or two. I also doubt this product alone will achieve great results but as one tool in your toolkit I believe it will.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for thinning hair and they all seem to be targeting the scalp while ignoring the actual hair. So they can be drying and/or smell bad and usually don&#x27;t lather much or easily, but not this stuff. It smells good (which is more important than some people think) and it&#x27;s rich and thick and lathers really well and it&#x27;s moisturizing as well. I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner yet but I will now. I really love this stuff and now can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as pictured, bottled and labeled.</li>
    <li> I am about halfway through the bottle and I *think* there is less hair in my brush and on the shower floor. I love the texture and the smell.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair in the front of my head.  The sides and back are fine.  This shampoo helps my hair.  It has stopped my hair from thinning out in the front of my head.  I use it in combination with Nexxus Diametress Conditioner and the combination works for me.  I would not suggest the Purador conditioner since it seemed to do nothing for my hair.  I change it up with the Tea Tree Tingle shampoo and conditioner from Trader Joes.  The only downside I see in this shampoo is the cost since it is expensive.</li>
    <li> so far this is a excellent product. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner together and I&#x27;m very happy with it. My hair feels silky to the touch when dry. I like the conditioner and the way it smells but I find that I have to use enough of it. I also have the problem with combing my hair while it&#x27;s wet because my hair is not soft like most conditioners I use. In all of this I&#x27;ll continue using this products in the hopes that it can help my hair. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with the Argan oil premium organic conditioner for the past 4 months. It works great for daily use. Leaves my hair clean and well hydrated. Seem to have less hair in the bottom of tub than before starting to use. Also taking some collagen supplement as well. Happy with the results thus far. Will continue to purchase and use.</li>
    <li> I have been losing my hair/have had thinning issues now for about 6 years.  I tried Rogaine and a couple other products with no success and was not happy with the list of ingredients in those products.  Then my wife found Pura d&#x27;or on a Groupon deal last year and ordered me a few bottles.  I was skeptical at first cause I had tried other things with no results, but after only a week or using Pura d&#x27;or my hair felt different, and now over long term I have been happy to say that my hair loss has stopped.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t start using this when I first started losing hair cause then I would have more hair.  I will continue to use this product to prevent hair loss, love it, love the ingredients, love the results!</li>
    <li> Absolutely high quality product with great reputation from many customers&#x27; experience, this is the main reason why I purchased this shampoo to improve my hair condition. I believe my hair loss will be stopped by using this shampoo, and I will stick with this product and keep buying for couple months.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and nice bottle, when you buy one can get one free thats really a good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks,so I haven&#x27;t noticed regrowth yet, but  It makes my hair look and feel amazing.</li>
    <li> I just started to use this product and have not yet been able to determine if it is doing what it claims it will do.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> great quality. organic, no harm to hair. just start to use. feel comfortable, will stick to using it. may have some clearly effect.</li>
    <li> Made my hair so dry and was getting my scalp dry and more dandruff. Don&#x27;t recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning and falling out before I started using Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo.  After a few washes i started noticing the difference that there was less loss and my hair felt better.  Now, after using it for some time, I have a full head of healthy hair.  I will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> Lathers well, you know it&#x27;s doing something without burning your scalp tingly, leaves hair clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated:  4 star shampoo, one star removed for vendor contacting me and promising more shampoo for a rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon you have a problem.  I have 10+ purchases a week and now getting 2-3 calls a day from vendors asking me to review with false promises.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! It makes my hair soft, and feel so clean!</li>
    <li> great for your hairs&lt;br /&gt;the organic shamoop i like it</li>
    <li> Just use it once because I just get it today.  But I am already experiencing noticeably less hair loss as usually there will be a lot of hair in the bathtub after the shower but today there is almost none. I hope it will be good for my hair, I like my hair long and luxuriant.</li>
    <li> The shampoo leaves hair with a lot of body and no feeling of residue.  It smells pleasant and generates a nice amount of lather.  I&#x27;m not sure yet if it will have a positive impact on my hair loss since I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Although it I have thinning hair in some spots. I wanted to see if this stuff works, so I gave it a month and I didn&#x27;t notice any less hairloss nor did it improve. The on thing that is nice about it, is that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh ingredients like alot of shampoos, but the smell of it reminds of dog shampoo for some reason lol. If it works for you great, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> It took about one week until I started to see the results. No more hair down the drain! Good to use everyday.</li>
    <li> I was having a horrible time with my hair falling out after I had my baby.  It was becoming very frustrating as I was losing SO much in the shower, and my husband was getting super irritated with my strands of hair EVERYWHERE.  I tried Nature&#x27;s Gate and it helped a little bit but I needed something better.  I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo for a few weeks and it has been WONDERFUL!  My hair falls out SIGNIFICANTLY less, and my husband has also noticed that he&#x27;s finding very little now in comparison to before.  It smells nice and my hair feels so nice and soft.  I originally have  wavy, frizzy hair--some reviews have stated that this shampoo is not good for this type, but it&#x27;s working for me :-)</li>
    <li> Face it, who wants to use a shampoo that smells bad, no matter how good it is.  With all the sweet shampoos out there that all smell the same, it was nice to find this shampoo that smells clean and fresh.  The lather is rich and smooth.  I have slight thinning, so I thought it would be good to try because the ingredients are very nice and most proven to have some effect on a healthy scalp.  Too early to tell if it will help with the thinning, but like it so far</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this stuff at all.  The smell is horrible.  I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I have noticed less hair fall after a month of using it but on the down side it seems really diluted with water? i have short hair and I have to use about five pumps to make it cover my head. It also drys out my hair a lot. And really over priced for such a small bottle ):</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month now, I have been using it daily because I have an oily scalp but trust me this does work. My hair loss seems to be reducing and the problem of my hair thinning looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this to every person who has to go in open air in dust, snow etc and hence have to shampoo every day. This is the product for you guys. It will keep u from hair loss and thinning.&lt;br /&gt;I decide to take off one star because the size of the bottle is small as compared to the price of it and hence its a heavy hit on your pocket every time you run out of it.</li>
    <li> My hairline has not yet receded. I bought this shampoo as a preventive measure. I&#x27;m happy to say that my hairline has remained the same. I find that I need to use conditioner after, because the shampoo leaves my hair feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I started to use this shampoo on March 14, 2013 and I am writing this review on April 24, 2013. I can see clear result in this time frame. There is less hair in the tube when I take shower, and during the day when I stroke my hair couple hair will come out, but nothing close to what it was. There is still some hair left on my brush, but again it is much less than what it used to be. I use it everyday and I don&#x27;t think it makes my hair oily (though I have thin hair and quite oily scalp). I do recommend getting it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much at all for me and is drying.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a thickening shampoo, not a regrowth or prevention system, still if it thickens it appears to be working so my husband likes it</li>
    <li> I started using this product to address my hair loss and have been using it for about a year.  In general, I would say that it is working well.  My hair looks and feels healthier when I&#x27;m using it.  I can tell the difference in my hair when I&#x27;m not using the product.  I can&#x27;t say for sure that it prevents hair loss, but I think that the healthier your hair is, the better the odds for keeping your hair.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me ..Made my hair oily and has a weird smell.</li>
    <li> A++++++++++ item.so good.</li>
    <li> My hair had been falling out for a few months.  My sister told me about this product.  I tried it and it really worked.  My hair started growing back immediately.  I am thankful for this product.  And it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> The jury is out for me on whether this slows or reduces hair loss.  It smells very nice and lathers nicely as well, however, it drys my hair out BADLY.  I&#x27;m using the Pura d&#x27;or conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t matter.  I&#x27;ve never had dry hair before, if anything, my hair is a bit oily by day end but not with this stuff, my hair feels like straw.  I&#x27;m going to only use it a couple of times a week to see if I can find a healthy balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of the dryness, I love the smell (as does my wife) and it feels like it cleans well without the chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo for about 5 weeks. Now I have already noticed that my hair seem healthier, not dry and fly away. I have had less breakage and less comb in my hair. I think it works and this shampoo is better than the product I used last year which is made in Canada.I will continue to use this product, I am looking forward to the results.Finally I would like to say--Worth to buy!!!</li>
    <li> Have been looking for the hair loss prevention shampoo and this one seems to be working well. I notice the hair volume left on the shower floor has been reducing. To be fair, I&#x27;ve been waiting to write this review after I have almost finished one bottle.</li>
    <li> I was suffering for loss hair because of work stress. I looked in google for best product for loss hair prevention and this brand came up. I bought it and after 2 months of use my hair stops falling, now it looks thicker and even my hairstylist told me that he sees new hair growing. Thank you pura dor</li>
    <li> I got the parcel today but shampoo was leaking in the box.Will write review again after using it</li>
    <li> i bought this shampoo because i was upset because i was losing so much hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate to find a natural shampoo with out SLS and parabens that also was designed for hairless.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very nice and the shampoo lathers up very soft and fluffy.  the essential oils make my scalp feel really clean.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and i have seen an drastic reduction in the hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is natural and clean.</li>
    <li> My hair feels fuller and healthier. I&#x27;m liking so far and would recommend.</li>
    <li> ThAnks to this Shampoo (and my husband who bought for me) my hairloss has decreased tremendously! . Highly recommended for women.</li>
    <li> The first time that I ordered this, it had minimal ingredients (which I liked), was a creamy consistency and it really seemed to work. The next bottle of it that I ordered had many more ingredients, is now clear, I have to use a lot more of it, smells really funky and I&#x27;m having more hair loss! I will find another shampoo!</li>
    <li> My husband really likes the product.  I purchased it because it&#x27;s organic.  The jury is still out on whether it helps at all with hair loss.</li>
    <li> great shampoo, makes hair look great and soft</li>
    <li> Product seems really high quality and I like that it&#x27;s organic compared to a lot of the chemical-filled shampoos I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s still too early to know if it&#x27;s working, but I will update this review when I can give a significant update.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over a year and hair loss has slowed</li>
    <li> Quality hair product. It helps hair loss prevention. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> It may be too soon to review but after my first wash my hair already felt thicker. Also, my boyfriend (who has thinning hair) could feel a difference in the texture of his hair. This product was recommend by 2 friends: a guy with a receding hair line (34 years old) and a young woman with long hair. His hair is beginning to come out more and her hair didn&#x27;t need any additional products after washing with Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> I lose a handful of hair each time I wash my hair. So I bought this shampoo given its name. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. I still lose the same amount of hair using this shampoo. In addition, the shampoo makes my hair frizzy. Won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
    <li> This actually works! For years I had been buying over priced shampoos at CVS et al, with no results. I heard about this, and figured why not, based on the reviews. Well, here is another success story, it really works!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife for her hair loss problem. She tried many other alternatives, but this worked well. In addition, her hair quality improved. Overall she is happy with it.</li>
    <li> I had been using the shampoo now for the last 20 days and based on the appearance and pattern of the thinning hair it looks like this shampoo is working.</li>
    <li> One month using the product and nothing has change maybe requieres more time, but for the moment is useless.</li>
    <li> just received it, and tried one time. It feels different in a good way. Will keep trying. Hope it will help.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! I have used it for 2 months and I really see results! Throughout the past few year I had seen a dramatic loss in hair...especially looking back in pictures. This resulted me in always keeping my hair up and hiding the amount of hair I really did have. This was when I saw this shampoo and I thought to myself...it won&#x27;t hurt since everyone is giving it such good results! So here I am..2 months in and I think it is really working!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle of this product. I have been trying all different shampoos and so far this one works the best. Do I still see my hair falling after shower? Yes. But I would say the amount has been reduced and I feel my hair gets thicker. Therefore I will continue trying this product. This time I also get the conditioner to pair with it, hopefully it will work even better.</li>
    <li> I am 68 and have pure white hair. I have been suffering a lot of breakage and a little thinning over the past couple of years. Just couldn&#x27;t get enough body into my hair. I have never spent more than 8 or 9 dollars on shampoo, so it was quite a leap of faith for me to try this one. But the results were instantaneous and amazing. With just the first use my hair felt thicker, stronger and had more shine. In fact, the first time I used it I went shopping &amp; stopped in a coffee shop &amp; the young ( yes, young! ) barrista said &amp;#34;You have beautiful hair!&amp;#34;. Well, enough said! I&#x27;m sold on this product and will continue to use it. It has fundamentally changed the way my hair looks, feels and behaves.</li>
    <li> Purchased this with the intention of replacing chemical preservatives and fragrances with healthy extracts and oils like the ones in this shampoo.  I only have to use one pump and I get a full rich lather with a pleasant and mild citrus-like scent. I use this product to slow the recession of my hairline and to scrub my arms as I have Kertatosis Pilaris (KP). I did have to pay a premium compared to my usual basic man-shampoo, however I believe the value is in the product and the packaging.  Full disclosure: I don&#x27;t normally review products. The packaging has an offer for an additional free bottle if you leave a review, I want another bottle for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know much about Argan oil, this helped: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argan_oil</li>
    <li> It smells like ginger.  I think it needs time to work.</li>
    <li> Seems to stop my hair loss. Smells really good too.</li>
    <li> It is not as big as I thought before received it. But it is gentle and makes my scalp feel released.</li>
    <li> Looks nice. After first try, my hair looks glossy.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product almost 3 months. And I notice that nothing happens yet! I have been really patient to give this product a faith, but my hair is still thinner and thinner. I emailed to the store to wonder about the issue, and they just told me to keep using the product without an explanation!!! Really?!? That is the reason why I should write this review!</li>
    <li> My husband has used the shampoo for a week and he likes it! Good smell and refreshing. Although it&#x27;s hard to tell whether it can prevent hair loss or not right now, currently we&#x27;re satisfied with the purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product so far, it&#x27;s easy on my hair , am seeing definite improvement in hair loss.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on ratings and reviews, and so far I am pleased.  I was looking for a shampoo to discourage hair loss and strengthen existing hair.  Since beginning use of this product, I have noticed that my hair feels thicker, stronger, and in overall better condition.  This shampoo has a pleasant scent, and I have actually stopped using a daily conditioner because I feel that this provides conditioning benefits as well as cleansing.  My only complaint is that this does not lather in the same way a regular shampoo does, so I find myself using quite a bit of the product to fully saturate my hair.  All in all, a nice, natural alternative to traditional shampoo, that seems to be helping the condition and strength of my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this shampoo... it really calms down all the gray frizzies.  Yay for argan!... and YAY for Pura d&#x27;or !!</li>
    <li> It really works!! I have less hair loss after shower since I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am going to be honest when I tell you I like this shampoo. I was worried it would be like cleansing conditioners that wind up clogging my hair follicles over time.  But it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;ve used it twice only since I received two weeks ago. but I only wash my hair 1-2 times a week. That being said, sometimes I have a lot of build up. This cleansed my hair but wasnt over dry. I just saw there is a conditioner to match. Maybe il try it but right now don&#x27;t need it.  I def see less hair fall in the shower for sure!!  That&#x27;s my purpose for buying this. I&#x27;ve used Nioxin as welll and this is so much better. Two times and less hair fall? Really? I will update if things change. If I get dry il prob just use a conditioner I already have. I do notice wen I use conditioner there is def a lot more hair fall in the shower so I try to avoid it and just use a leAve in after I wash my hair. I don&#x27;t smell the awesome smell.  I mean it&#x27;s not bad by any means.  I don&#x27;t really smell anything. I follow directions to lather, massage for two min and rinse.  No repeat. My hair seems really full today.  I&#x27;m just concerned if it is safe for color treated hair???... My roots are looking darker earlier but who knows could be imaging it. Get this shampoo for hair fall!!! I had hair fall for three years now due to&lt;br /&gt;A medication.  Nice feeling to look in the drane and seed close to none.</li>
    <li> I used Clinicure for a long time but recently found out I am allergic to sulfates so went look for a new hair loss shampoo. This is a really fantastic product. My hair feels very clean, and I love the scent. I haven&#x27;t miss clinicure at all! I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to comment on it&#x27;s hair loss prevention ability, but I will update my review once I&#x27;ve been using it for longer. At least for now, I haven&#x27;t noticed any extra hair falling out and my hair feels exactly the same as it did when I used Clinicure. It&#x27;s so easy to purchase this on Amazon, and this will definitely be my new go to shampoo!</li>
    <li> good shampoo with a good smell. I have just use it for the first time so that I can not see sth about the hair. I hope it will work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and I&#x27;m beginning to show signs of hair loss. This  shampoo smells nice enough. Seems to be a very good volumizer. I&#x27;ll have to see if it helps with the hair loss a few months down the line.</li>
    <li> the ship is quickly,customer sevice is nice. I think the product will be good at my hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells good, lathers well &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now &amp; did see some reduction in my hair fall. I&#x27;ll continue using it.</li>
    <li> My hair felt soft and free off any residue. I had an itchy scalp before I used and this resolved the issue within one use. I use california baby body wash and shampoo and that usually leaves my scalp itchy after a week..this was perfection</li>
    <li> Brought this shampoo for my mom for her early 50s hair loss. So far she said her hair loss is gradually slowing down and she says this shampoo does a good job cleaning her scalp as well. However, hair loss is caused by multiple factors, but so far she sees this product is working.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful. It worked and stopped the hair loss immediately. I love it.</li>
    <li> I feel fresh and no hair loss the first time</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for two weeks and I love it so much!!! I can feel that it makes my hair very smooth and soft. It is super effective than most shampoo I&#x27;ve used before in China. So I highly recommended it to all of you.</li>
    <li> it is very help for oil hair, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Even though I don&#x27;t have any issues with hair loss at the moment, it&#x27;s an amazing feeling to know that this is completely natural - and it will prevent issues later on, down the road. It&#x27;s worth every penny, even if it costs more than the regular shampoo!</li>
    <li> I honestly thought i was not going to see any difference in the hairs, but after trying for few weeks it started showing small percent of result. I&#x27;m really excited to see if after the use of entire bottle my head would look lot more better.</li>
    <li> My hair started to thin in the crown area about a year ago, and no matter what vitamins or minerals I took, the hair loss didn&#x27;t stop.&lt;br /&gt;I was using another well known brand of shampoo for hair loss and there was no change in the condition of my hair and I would still get a handful of hair whenever I shampooed, which was every day.  I tried the Pura d&#x27;or on the basis of the Amazon reviews and I am not disappointed.  After three weeks, I am only seeing a couple of hairs when I wash, and my hair looks thicker and fuller and is very manageable.  If you have any post menopausal thinning, give this shampoo a try.. It worked for me.  Also, my husband was so impressed that he is using it now.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has worked well for both my hair texture and scalp. For a male, I have longer hair (shoulder length), and I only require two pumps to fully lather. I massage this product into my scalp for 2 minutes and then rinse. Even after first use, my hair felt thicker, but perhaps a bit dryer than usual.  My fiance reported that my hair smells nicer and agreed that it feels softer than my previous shampoo choice. As for hair-loss prevention, I am unsure. As a physician, am in favor of the ingredients listed within the product. I will try this product over the next six months before providing a more thorough review regarding hair follicle density.</li>
    <li> Like the shampoo. Reduced hair loss.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this. I notice less hair loss when I comb my hair, especially after I wash it, and he notices new hair growth. I love the way it makes my hair feel, although I do feel like I need to use another shampoo from time to time to get rid of slight build up.</li>
    <li> Like the product so far</li>
    <li> Pleasant to use.  I think my hair is fuller and losing less hair.  I did not find it drying to my hair or my scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about three weeks so I haven&#x27;t seen a difference with my hair loss.  This shampoo leaves my hair dry and full of tangles.  I will try it another week or two to see if things change for the best.</li>
    <li> Finally, I like washing my hair again.  Doesnt strip the hair, gentle enough for everyday use and doesnt leave the hair with any residue, rinses clean and my scalp doesnt feel clogged or irritated.  My wife even noticed my hair looks &amp;#34;shiny-er&amp;#34;.  Ive noticed highlights too.</li>
    <li> I have bought two bottles of this shampoo now (I don&#x27;t really recommend the conditioner). I have color treated hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother it too much. I don&#x27;t have dandruff problems but this keeps my hair feeling really soft and healthy. I only use conditioner about once per week and other days I just use a natural leave-in conditioner spray. I have fine hair, but lots of it. This gets the job done.</li>
    <li> After using this product for 2 weeks I noticed more hairs falling out than before...will not be using it !</li>
    <li> works wonders on my hair.  It stopped falling out.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any hair changes since I used it-now has been 3 weeks</li>
    <li> It is really bad shampoo I ever used. when I have used 1st time. my hairs start falling more than before and 2nd time more and 3rd time more than 2nd time. Really bad quality product. Please don&#x27;t use that product. also it makes your scalp with dandruff. I need to return that product. please let me know how to get the refund.</li>
    <li> This product is currently the best in hair regrowth shampoos on Amazon. Ive tried the others and this one def stood out as the best.</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair finally started to grow faster.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works but the pump doesn&#x27;t work. Only 20 bucks, not worth the hassle of returning it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months now and I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in hair loss. Before using this product I would pick up huge globs of hair I lost from my tubs drain stopper after taking a shower and now I now the amount I pick up is A LOT LESS. I&#x27;m VERY happy so far because can notice the difference in thickness of my hair already and I think it&#x27;s working. I recommend that people give this product a try.</li>
    <li> This item help me keep my hair stay , can not said it help get more hair because I just use I bottle , but it help to you reduce hair loss.</li>
    <li> OK.  I was a bit skeptical at first but after the 1st shampoo my hair was healthier looking and had a shine &amp; bounce that I hadn&#x27;t seen in years!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and my scalp is no longer itchy, my hair is fuller, it&#x27;s shines like the hair on a teenager and I could not be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only will I recommend this product to EVERYONE....but I even purchased the &amp;#34;Pura D’or Argan Oil Premium Organic Shampoo Tranquility&amp;#34; for my son along with the Conditioner.  The fact that it&#x27;s all natural is a definite PLUS...I wanted something that would work for him as well without all the harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He too is living itch free thanks to this AMAZING product line.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I used a different all natural shampoo, and it left my hair feel dull.  This Shampoo gives great volume.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Overall it is a good product and I like the natural smell of it, it&#x27;s not like other shampoos with artificial fragrance. I&#x27;m using it daily and noticing the improvement in thickness and smoothness.</li>
    <li> I was losing my hair until i started using this shampoo. it doesn&#x27;t help regrow but it definitely stops loss!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. My husband started taking Biotin and using this shampoo and the combination has very much stopped his hair loss/thinning. I would definitely recommend trying this if you have thinning hair!</li>
    <li> The shampoo definitely leaves my hair feeling very very clean, with little residue or chemical product left in. It does not lather like other shampoos because it is missing all of the sulfates that make bubbles. Just because a shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather into lots of bubbles, does not mean it&#x27;s bad!  I am hoping as I continue to use this product my hair will get healthier and my scalp not matted with chemicals. For now it&#x27;s off to a good start and it feels clean with little residue in it.  I&#x27;m hoping it will help with hair thinning, but for now it&#x27;s too soon to tell. I will write back after a solid month&#x27;s use of the product to update you on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 8 months now and I&#x27;m so happy with how clean my hair feels after each wash. My hair is naturally thick and dry and it&#x27;s definitely better hydrated now and much more manageable. I can&#x27;t really say it stopped the hair loss completely in such short amount of time, but but seems to have slowed the process as I find less hair on my pillow, shirt shoulders, etc...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep on using it and append to this review in a year.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great with softening my naturally curly hair.  It&#x27;s a superb moisturizer, nicely fragranted; I don&#x27;t even need to go my hair dresser when going natural, but carry some along for her to use when shampooing my hair when I opt for straight styles.</li>
    <li> Does as expected and not overly expensive.</li>
    <li> Awesome .love love love it .it have my hair life again.thanks for ur Organic product ...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made my hair feel and grow so much more. Definitely get again.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is good product.</li>
    <li> it is so boring that when i open the box, a lot of shampoo has been leaked.</li>
    <li> Ithis is my second time buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;it was good , make my hair siny and has nice smell. I dont really notice stop lossing my hair . But I like it in general</li>
    <li> I had waited to review this shampoo until I had used it for a while. I&#x27;ve now been using it for over a month. I&#x27;m a former Revita user &amp; I say &amp;#34;former&amp;#34; because I love this shampoo and have no plans to use anything else anytime soon. This shampoo does have an odd &amp; strong smell but after its rinsed out &amp; your hair is dry &amp; styled you can&#x27;t smell it anymore. My hair is healthier than it has ever been. Much of my hair loss had stopped with the use of the Revita but it seemed liked recently the quality of Revita had decreased.  I was starting to see a few hairs on my comb &amp; in my hand when rinsing my hair.  I found Pura d&#x27;or on Amazon and based on reviews decided to give it a try. I expected an increase in hair loss for a while (that is common when switching shampoos) but I actually had no increase in hair loss. In fact, in the first week, finding a few hairs in my comb or when I rinsed my hair stopped. I also have a very sensitive scalp &amp; many shampoos break my scalp out. This shampoo has not bothered my skin/scalp. I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 37 and my hair has started thinning at the front but not very visibly yet. I had been using this shampoo for about 3 months and as far as I could tell, my hair didn&#x27;t seem to be losing any additional density. I will say that it is not a very refreshing shampoo as it made my hair feel very coarse and tangly so I suggest you use it with come conditioner. Also my scalp was always itchy. My other qualm was that while using it, I developed a wart like bump on my scalp that started off very small like a grain of sand but is now the size of pin head. When I asked about it, my doctor asked if I had switched shampoos recently and I said I did. So perhaps this was a reaction to the shampoo. I have no evidence, it is just speculative, but I stopped using the shampoo to be cautious.</li>
    <li> same as Avalon but way more expensive!!!</li>
    <li> I just got this shampoo in the mail today! I&#x27;ve used it already and so far, so good. :) The smell is a little bit stronger than I anticipated, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, especially because it smells clean and herb-y, which I like. Overall, I have high hopes for this shampoo and we&#x27;ll see how my hair fares over the next few weeks and months.</li>
    <li> Works well and does not leave my hair so dry and rough. With my organic conditioner, it is a good match to have smooth hair.</li>
    <li> Just received the item, washed my hair and left it feeling great. Still have to wait for results.</li>
    <li> I could tell the difference in the volume and thickness of my hair after using this product for a week. Hair was coming out of my hair a lot less during shampoo and showering. I like the smell and the feel of my hair after using this shampoo! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is having hair loss problems!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 4 days now, but I love it so far! My hair feels soft and has body again. Can&#x27;t say on the hair loss prevention yet, but I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product few month ago and I never tried it ,because i thought is going to be like other products that I bought before from different companies and brands and my hair loss never stopped and some time even got worse though I had paid a lot of money for them. therefore even I didn&#x27;t leave any comment within these past few months. But 2 weeks ago my hair loss got a lot worse and I was stressed as a result but suddenly I remembered that I bought this shampoo before so I opened it and started to use it . To be honest with you i throw away all other shampoos that was in my bathroom. I just want to say if you love your hair ,you gotta try this. It worked for me hope it does for you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month. I guess some small hair has started to grow.</li>
    <li> It feels great and smells fresh my hair feels stronger and looks healthy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or Hair loss prevention shampoo for about a month now. I love this shampoo! My hair shedding has slowed down already! The shampoo has a beautiful fragrance and it lathers beautifully, giving a slight tingly sensations when you massage it in. I will definitely continue to use this shampoo and look forward to even better results over the next 6 months</li>
    <li> First, I thought it may smell like medicine before I use it. But it actually smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the price is not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Third, I have used it for more than one week. My hair feel good. Maybe it is a good start.</li>
    <li> Since using this product I have not seen nearly as much hair falling out. I really like the fact that it is just one shampoo without multiple steps to follow. Just one step! The fact that it has a pump top is a plus too. If my brothers and their lack of hair compared to my hair is any indication, this shampoo works miracles!</li>
    <li> I have been losing a lot of hair, so my hair looks thin and flat.  I&#x27;ve tried T-Gel and Biotin shampoo for the past few months, but did not see improvements on hair grow or loss.  I decided to give Pura D’or Argan Organic Shampoo a try.  I used Pura D’or Argan Organic Shampoo 2 days in a row and already see my hair is not as flat as before.  Definitely will continue to use this product and look forward to seeing hair grow in the next month or so.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair soft &amp; bouncy .  I cant honestly say it stops hair loss, cause I continue to lose my hair.</li>
    <li> I had a very serious hair loss problem, each time when I wash my hair, it lost a lot. However, when I heard this shampoo, I intend to try it, you know what just after one time use, my hair loss problem is better than the ever. And it also make&#x27;s my hair keep the moisture and smoothy even I just use the shampoo without the other conditioner. It is really a good product and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, clean ingredients and good price.</li>
    <li> ·just used for two weeks, I can&#x27;t say it helped my hair growing but it certainly prevented the loss, i can feel it during daily shower. look forward to further effects.</li>
    <li> The shampoo seems to be of good quality and contains no harmful chemicals. The shampoo lathers well, leaves hair feeling clean and fresh and calms down the scalp inflammation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m buying this shampoo 2nd time because it was really good product. My hair fells much fuller and shinier I will still use it for my hair because it&#x27;s organic ingredients</li>
    <li> I use it everyday for over half an year.  it has not helped to get my hair back, but at least it stopped falling out and kept my hair health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing stress-related hair loss, so I&#x27;m giving a few products like this a try. So far, I&#x27;m not at all impressed with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have porous, curly/wavy, natural hair. I find this product drying, with no &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; to help avoid breakage. I&#x27;m also not very fond of the smell. From the first dozen ingredients,  I&#x27;d expected a coconut smell, but all I smell is tea tree oil. It&#x27;s not overwhelming, but not particularly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a substantial amount of product for the price, and I like the pump bottle. Thus the 2 stars.</li>
    <li> This may be my first Amazon review but I just have to given all the questions and one and five star reviews. I am a guy. I have been using this product for a couple days. I can say without a doubt that my head has responded well. I was using Morrocan Oil from my salon before. I take .25 mg of propecia and use  Kirkland liquid at night. My head does not itch from the liquid anymore that is a fact. My hair is more full that is also a fact. The quality I received was on par with the other positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a Rogaine or like wise product I would recommend this as it seems the ingredients don&#x27;t clash and cause itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the conditioner and follow the directions on the bottle for washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will help someone with a similar hair loss regiment.</li>
    <li> just received the product and used it once. no annoying smell, feels good. still yet to see its effect.</li>
    <li> All of the stuff in product description is legit!</li>
    <li> Great all natural products that nourish the scalp. Also, a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> it smells good. I will keep using it to see the result.</li>
    <li> It helps a lot. Both my husband and I thought less hair dropped since we used the shampoo! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo about a week ago. Too soon to say about the hair loss prevention, but I like the scent and how the hair feel. I&#x27;d definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working.It is legit. But it is expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few week already and I do feel that my hair is not falling as much. But I am also taking hair vitamins so maybe it is the combination of both. I do love the fact that it is organic.</li>
    <li> This is my first time to use this and my friend recommends me to try this. It is good and I am look forward to its effect!!</li>
    <li> Hair began thinning at temples in 40&#x27;s.  Was getting so bad the scalp was showing through on the sides of my hair!.  Began using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention and immediately noticed a difference in the way my scalp felt-revigorated, and the volume to my hair increased.  No hair loss noted anymore in the shower!!!.  Nice smell.  Not a great deal of lather, save that for commercial brands that strip the hair.  For someone who has used conditioner her whole life for dull, dry and frizzy hair, I have to say I have not used it once since starting this line of products.  I just rub some Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil through my hair after towel drying.  I say it is worth a try.  Nothing works for everyone but I have found this line of products superior.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into my second bottle, i haven&#x27;t seen any improvement, as matter of fact i see more hair falling when i&#x27;m rubbing my head. good luck with you guys. will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good organic shampoo and I really like this one. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, is refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s leaving build-up on my hair. The scent is nice too and not overpowering. Not sure if it&#x27;s actually helping with hair loss prevention but it&#x27;s an overall good organic shampoo.</li>
    <li> the product helped me resolve my hair problem, I am the oily type, but after use this, the hair become smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a week. Maybe it&#x27;s just wishful thinking, but I swear I see positive results! I can&#x27;t say if there is new hair growth. The shedding has seemed to stop though. Pleasant scent, like Bee Balm!</li>
    <li> I have the M shape front hair loss and use the product daily. This is my 1st bottle and haven&#x27;t seen apparent effect yet. It&#x27;s a good quality shampoo itself, but it&#x27;s still early to tell whether it&#x27;s worth the extra bucks on the main claim - wait and see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a month now and have noticed that there is more of a shine in my hair. I honestly can&#x27;t tell if its been helping with my hair loss situation but I absolutely love that this shampoo is organic and cruelty free. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> Product smells god but hair still falls out , will continue until bottle is empty</li>
    <li> Very good product and delivered very fast. Thx</li>
    <li> This shampoo is incredible. About a year ago some medication caused my hair to thin significantly, and although it has been slowly growing back, I was still losing more hair in the shower than I would like. After only two weeks of using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo every day, my hair looks fuller, thicker, and healthier than ever!</li>
    <li> Have been using the shampoo for only a couple weeks.  Have not noticed yet whether or not it will prevent hair loss.  If it  does, will change my rating to love it and 5 stars.  I do like it so far.....leaves hair smelling nice and I notice it leaves my hair much more manageable not to mention alot shinier and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> First time in using such a product.  While I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be flapping my hair in the wind like Fabio anytime soon, the quality of the product is apparent from the smell, lather, and rinse.  Good value for the money in comparison with its competition.  Buy it on the subscription plan for extra savings.</li>
    <li> This product is good and it does prevent hair loss, but you might have to use a conditioner if you want your hair to look good.</li>
    <li> Its too soon to tell, but I love the way it leaves my hair shiny and it smells great too</li>
    <li> Smells good! After washing the hair, it feels mild and refreshing. I am waiting the new hair~</li>
    <li> I cannot attest to prevention of hair loss just yet, but I can say the gentle cleansing is great, the shine after my hair dries is lovely, and my hair does feel thicker after washing in this shampoo. I am looking forward to the results from long term usage.</li>
    <li> I have used it for about a month, my hair loss problem has become better now. I hope it stops totally, then I&#x27;ll update my review to 5!</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as ratings.  I have to wonder if the ratings were bought by the company.  Not worth the Price.  My hair seems dryer and after one month I have seen no improvement on &amp;#34;volumen&amp;#34; like claimed.</li>
    <li> This is very unique herbal shampoo which consist all ingredients which are very helpful for hair.I recommed it for all ages peoples.</li>
    <li> Another well spoken product, well chosen and catchy title (organic)  with no positive results for consummer, what a waste of money</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Worst shampoo ever. Leaves hair even more greasy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for one month, and have absolutely no idea if it&#x27;s preventing further hair loss or not.  I feel like it is way too early to tell, and it&#x27;s difficult to understand what phase of the hair growth cycle I was in when I began using it.  If you use this shampoo for one night, and you lose a ton of hair... you were probably going to lose a ton of hair in that cleaning and are far more likely to be looking for lost hairs as well.  The same goes for if you shampoo once and find fewer hairs lost.  Fully understanding your individual hair loss is something that takes years, and a lot of money.  Your hair loss is not my hair loss, so I can not tell you what will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, and this is the core of my review, this is a great daily shampoo when combined with the conditioner.  I can style my hair the way I want to (at this stage of my hair life) and it feels clean and most important... not itchy!  I&#x27;m going to continue to use this shampoo until things get worse (as they naturally do) and I get desperate (as I always do) and try something new (as I always do).  For now, four stars.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for the past ~1 year with good results.  Believe that is has helped to maintain my hair level over the past year.  Hard to quantify... but believe there is less hair on my brush in the past year compared to the year before...</li>
    <li> I am using this shampoo for a couple of months. This is the best shampoo I have ever used. My scalp feels very good after shampooing and I am hopeful that this sampoo could help to stop my ongoing hair loss.</li>
    <li> I am a woman in my mid 50&#x27;s who has been experiencing hair loss for the last couple of years.  Scanning Amazon products I found this shampoo and decided to try it.  I must say after the 3 or 4th shampoo (I shampoo daily) I did notice an extreme difference in the amount of hair I was losing.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to grow the hair back unfortunately, however, it does not advertise that.  It only states that is prevents hair loss and I must say that I would consider that a very valid and honest claim.  I truly wish that I had found this shampoo sooner.</li>
    <li> It smells natural. After using it, my hair turn out to be very fluffy and smooth. Because I only used it once, I have not seen the effectiveness of reducing hair. But I am optimistic towards its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Been using for about 6 months now. Hair loss has slowed down dramatically, no new growth though. This isn&#x27;t the cure to hair regrowth but it is definitely good at slowing down the hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past 2 weeks.  So far i really love the shampoo, it smells great and you don&#x27;t need to use that much.  I used to use Nioxin and this shampoo makes my hair feel and style better.  As far as the hair loss prevention i have noticed a slight reduction of shedding, but the jury is still out.  I think i need to give it a minimum of 6 mo before I am realistically able to give an accurate review on that aspect.  I will try to update the review regarding hair loss once i feel I have used the product long enough.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo choice!</li>
    <li> Actually it is not that good...I am disappointed with it but I will still use it and give review few months later.</li>
    <li> Just started using it, smells nice and lathers well. I like the ingredients used. Still needs a few more uses before I can tell if there are any results. So far it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this shampoo. I thought the price was a little high but considering I have very short hair it should last me about 3 months. I still have a full head of hair Just hoping that the thinning hair on my hairline comes back a little thicker. I&#x27;ve been using harsh dandruff shampoos for years and I think its starting to take a toll. Not sure what to expect but I&#x27;m not expecting any miracles. This shampoo can only do more good than harm with all the natural ingredients listed. I will probably continue to buy and will definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for more than a month now. My hair loss seems to be much more slow down. I do not see a lot of hair around the sink in the morning when I comb, Now I recommended to my wife to use it. She will see how it goes.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does a very nice job, leaving my hair clean and giving it some shine. I also like the scent, it&#x27;s not perfumey, just a little bit of an herbal scent. I&#x27;ve been using for a month or so, and see some wispy hairs growing in where my hair is thinning. I think it might actually be helping.</li>
    <li> I read great reviews about this product and since this product is not available in India, I ordered this from the US from an FBA seller. When I received it there was white curdy separation inside the bottle. Looked disgusting. I thought it will go away by shaking the bottle. But no. Over time the curdy separation has only increased. Its sticky and disgusting. This shampoo also has a disgusting smell. The first time gave it a try it turned my hair oily. And now there is no option to return this product or complain. That is $25 i&#x27;ll never see again. Stay away! First time in my life I&#x27;ve come across a defective shampoo that hasn&#x27;t yet expired. And that too a brand that boast to be best and is infact one of the costlier ones.</li>
    <li> My hair feels thicker since using this! Great product, I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have DUPA (diffuse unpatterned alopecia areata). Basically, my hair thins diffusely all over my scalp, including the &amp;#34;donor&amp;#34; areas (sides and back of scalp) that usually do not thin. I&#x27;ve tried everything to get it to stop. You name it and I&#x27;ve tried it. I just received my bottle last week and although I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s regrown any hair yet, I have high hopes. I don&#x27;t see as many hairs falling out in the shower when I use this product and it leaves my hair/scalp feeling clean without that chemical feeling of clean. I&#x27;ll update in 3-6 months to see if I regrow any hair, but I think it&#x27;s a good product to invest in.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know or I am not sure if this product is preventing my hair loss (something that is difficult for regular people), but I love it. I felt my hair went back to its natural and smooth texture like I never before. The price is really worth it. Just try once for curiosity and you will see by yourself.</li>
    <li> Good smell , hope it works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a week so I can&#x27;t attest to how well it is doing in controlling hair loss but I noticed other comments about&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s smell and lathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as some shampoos that contain the sodium lauryl sulfate that I&#x27;m trying to avoid but it isn&#x27;t terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One pump seems to lather my short hair.  After I work it through, I leave it on for a few minutes.  At that point in time, the lathering seems to diminish.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo with the conditioner about two weeks ago, leaves my hair soft and manageable, can&#x27;t wait till 6 months from now and see.</li>
    <li> Shampoo seems to be helping but I wish the matching conditioner would do a better job. I love the fresh, clean herbal scent!!</li>
    <li> One of the best Shampoos I have used. Was skeptical at first but happy with the effect it had on my hair</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura for about a month and I feel as though I am seeing less hair in my drain! My hair is fine and conditioner weighs down my hair. I love that I am able to use this shampoo and don&#x27;t need a conditioner and my hair is still super soft and manageable when it dries. I also like the smell! Although it is not your traditional &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell, it does smell very nice. I will continue to use this shampoo and hope the results continue or improve with regular use.</li>
    <li> Lost lots of hair since the fall and hope this works.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for two weeks. After first using it, I surprisingly noticed less hair fall out. This is the first produce that I saw such amazing results at the first use. I will recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a scam at first, I never really believed in this type of product, but I found a Groupon for it and decided to give it a try.  Haven&#x27;t used another shampoo since.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a decrease in hair loss.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is great helped with my hair loss and breakage</li>
    <li> really good. use it for about two weeks. feel really good.</li>
    <li> Good smells! Like it!</li>
    <li> Well, it did work after first time I used it. My hair lost decreasingly. However, it now comes back I assume it is because my stress. I am still continuing it. In the future, I will recommend my father to use it.</li>
    <li> Frankly, I bought this shampoo thinking that it would be just another one I tried full of promises, that did not work as advertised. I have been using this shampoo daily for over three weeks now, and am truly impressed. My hair is full of body, I am seeing less hair loss, and it even is helping my dry scalp. I am sure I will be ordering this shampoo over and over again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32, female. I &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; about twice a year, at which point, if it&#x27;s too bad, I tend to just cut my hair shorter and the shedding stops. It reaches a certain length again, and I cut it again. About 6 months ago, though, I started to shed again. I cut my hair. The shedding didn&#x27;t stop. I cut my hair a bit shorter... but it still didn&#x27;t help. *gasp* I&#x27;m like, legit losing my hair! ... is what I thought. Odd, though--none of the women in my family have had hair loss like this, and it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;all over&amp;#34; shedding, not a bald spot developing. So, I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon this shampoo and figured it was worth a try. Unlike many reviewers, I&#x27;d like to stipulate that using this shampoo is the ONLY thing I&#x27;m doing differently. I&#x27;m not taking any biotin or other hair-related vitamins and I&#x27;m not using any other hair loss product like Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this shampoo for a week (five shampoos so far), but I have to say... there is definitely a difference. Before, I&#x27;d get in the shower and every time I pulled my hands away from my head, my fingers would just be webbed with hair. Hair was all over my pillow when I woke up in the morning. It would get under my shirt during the day and make me itchy... This is not the case anymore. After one week, my shedding is about half of what it was. I can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;s actually been any regrowth, but my hair loss is certainly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t expect much... this was a &amp;#34;meh... worth a try...&amp;#34; purchase. But it actually seems to be working for me.</li>
    <li> Loved it!! Definitely going to be buying this shampoo again. It left my hair feeling full and soft. Love that there is no SLS or any other junk, so I know I&#x27;m really pampering my hair :)))</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells good, and after washing my hair, my hair feels stronger than before, at least somehow harder</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have this item</li>
    <li> This is a great option to use in conjunction with Nizoral 1%.  It will not dry your hair and its all-natural ingredients make for an incredibly good tool in the fight against hair loss for men!</li>
    <li> A nice, foamy and natural shampoo that leave my hair feeling clean without excessive chemicals. It&#x27;s pricier compared to your average shampoo but it does last a long time so well worth the cost.  For good or bad, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave much sense on your hair after.</li>
    <li> At the beginning, I did not feel much change to my hair volume. But after a week of using the shampoo, I started to feel there are some new hair growing. My hair loss significantly deduced. It&#x27;s the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I had this product for about a month, I see no difference  in hair shed. It does have a nice lather with just a small amount, and the smell is nice too. Will continue to use till the bottle is empty and then review again.</li>
    <li> Lathers ups nicely and smells pleasant.  I have only been using it for about a month along with other lifestyle changes and some minoxidil but my hair does some to be a little thicker even though I believe I am currently going through the minoxodil shed.  Cant say definitively whether or not this is helping but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting anything.</li>
    <li> I have use this product for less than a month so far. It has a mild fragrance and leaves the hair clean and manageable. A small amount latters easily and is more than enough to cover entire scalp. It appears as my hair is gaining some strength, but again I think is too soon to make any conclusions</li>
    <li> My hair has a lot of oil if I do not wash it every day. This shampoo makes my hair clean and it helps reduce the hair loss. I will continue use this product to see the effects on the hair loss prevention.</li>
    <li> Not like everyone says here</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Its the only I ever use now for a whole year and my hair is definitely fuller and longer. I would definitely recommended this to anybody.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has brought my hair back to life!</li>
    <li> I received it earlier than estimated delivery time so shipping was quick. I was waiting for this and just used it and my hair feels soft and smells clean. I will give some time regarding effects on hair loss as it take some time</li>
    <li> I wish I would have found this product sooner.  My husband and I have been using it for just over a month and love it.  Hair loss has definitely decreased, and I never realized how much my last organic shampoo was drying out my scalp - this one doesn&#x27;t at all.  Shampoo has a slightly medicinal, but very good smell.</li>
    <li> Shampoo wonderful and useful</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks, and I do notice an improvement.  My hair looks a bit thicker and fuller.  Nothing dramatic, but again, its only been a few weeks.  The scent is pretty good, and it lathers up nicely.  Only complaint so far is that after the first few days of use, my scalp was a little itchy.  But that seems to have subsided, as I haven&#x27;t noticed it over the last week or so.  Also, the bottle did leak out a little during shipping.  Not enough to bother with a return though.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this is organic, has no harmful chemicals and especially that it&#x27;s cruelty free. Is it working as a hair loss preventative? Hmm- I don&#x27;t think so, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle. I might purchase again because I still think it&#x27;s a good value coupled with the reasons above.</li>
    <li> felt good with very first application</li>
    <li> I figured 2,500+ reviewers can&#x27;t be wrong, so I am incredibly disappointed at the ineffectiveness of this shampoo. I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle and it has done nothing.</li>
    <li> I started using this product today 10-13-14 and I really like the feel of it on my scalp and afterwards the feeling of my hair is different after just one use. It is softer and more light feeling with great shine and manageability. It styled up great too even without conditioner. I want to fully rate this product so I will do an update halfway in and at the end of the first bottle, when I hope to be able to tell you that I see improvement in my hair loss and some regrowth as well. I only wash my hair once or twice a week so I hope it last me a good while. I used a very small amount, but my hair is on the short side so I used about a pea size amount and I washed twice due to having some sticky/heavy feeling product in my hair to begin with. The lather did not show up the first wash, but did come up on the second wash. It was not a ton of lather like store bought shampoo though, so do not be surprised by that. Do watch your eyes it will sting if it gets in there for sure. The fragrance is not like store bought shampoo, but was nice and easy to live with so I am pleased with that. I bought this for signs of hair loss, possible hair regrowth, and for the natural qualities of it. My scalp feels cleaner with less heavy build up, and has already a slight tingly feeling after just one use, so I am super hopeful! Look for an update from me for sure. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks since I have started using it and I can already see the changes. My hair looks more voluminous and when I comb my hair after shower, there is definitely less hair fall. The only thing missing is conditioning. I do feel the need to condition my hair after a wash from this shampoo. And I also love the herbal fragrance. Overall, a nice product and I am starting to like it!</li>
    <li> I like the way this shampoo makes my hair feel, soft and not weighed down.  The smell is pleasant.  I am not too sure yet about the effectiveness, I believe that I am shedding less.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about one month so the review is relatively relevant. I&#x27;m not expecting a full head of hair from only using this shampoo. However, my hair seems to be thicker and I think it does perform well as a hair loss prevention shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;On the side note, I have to appraise the company for its excellent customer service. I contacted the representative because I made a mistake earlier. The way they resolved the issue was far beyond my expectation.</li>
    <li> I totally love this organic shampoo, super super natural and healthy.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shampoo!  When I use other shampoo I usually come out with a handful of hair...Very little is falling out since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I think this product has given my &amp;#34;gone limp and wiry&amp;#34; hair some re-newed body, but the hair loss continues.  A little bit of this shampoo lathers very easily, so the pump bottle should last awhile.  Maybe more shampoo applications per week would get better hair loss results?</li>
    <li> Great products. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for about 11 months.The product is very thick, so it doesn&#x27;t take a huge amount for each shampoo--just make sure your hair&#x27;s very wet when you apply it so it gets distributed well and makes a rich lather. If you are looking for a solution to help with the thinning I recommend this to ANYONE.</li>
    <li> I read about others results and decided to try this shampoo.  Hesitant of the smell as I have allergies I was surprised and delighted it is a natural nice smell and not perfumey.  It does suds tho I use 3 small amts with 3 rinsings,  I have long hair.  I do not need length,  just to stop hair from falling out.  I do believe it is working.  I see small short hairs all around my face and will keep using it for 6 months or so along with good diet and fish oils and cooking with olive oil etc and eating good protein!  I even think my grey hair color is better,  darker in the back ( of course!) and very shiny.  I get compliments.  I am 63.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for close to a month. I have gotten several compliments in the past few days that my hair looks thicker. I have tried many many shampoos, treatments (romaine, etc), medicines (avodart, etc) but this is the first time I have ever heard that. I also take hair vitamins, natural DHT blockers (Hairomega 3-in-1), saw palmetto but adding this shampoo is the only variation I have done for the past few months.    I have to agree that my hair does look thicker. I do not know if it actually is, but it looks better. I fully realize that there has not been enough time to grow hair, etc. Just reporting what I see and feedback that I am getting.  I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> Great product, nice smell and the pump is really convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my husband who was complaining of thinning hair,&lt;br /&gt;and he is liking the results so far.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!!  I&#x27;ve experience hair loss from hormone therapy, and thought my world was ending!!  This shampoo has saved my hair and my life!!  Within a month I noticed less hair shed.  I can see new growth, and more manageability!!  As with any product, you must be patient, and allow it to work.</li>
    <li> I heard this product from my friend, and bought it on September. Frankly speaking, I have tried many products before, no matter American brands or foreign brands. And for this product, I still hold a conservative attitude and hope it could be better than others. When I used it at the first two weeks, it was hard to say that it was preventing the hair loss. However, I can feel this shampoo was giving nutritional support for my hair. It was a very good experience. Therefore, I bought three of them for my father, because he has the same problem on his hair.  For now, both of my father and I have used it more than three months, and both of us feel this product is pretty good for our hair&#x27;s health. Hence, I write this review for all of you, and hope this product will be good for your hair as well.</li>
    <li> using this shampoo  for  a month now  and see difference. No hair fall while washing hair even at first wash. Was so surprised and have recommended it to my friends .</li>
    <li> It does  stop my hair loss which is good, but it also makes my skin very dry. So I have to use it once every other day instead of everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and have noticed less hair falling out</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...it&#x27;s just a bit too thick to pump which is why I took away 1 star...but it makes my hair and scalp fabulous...and the SMELL! mmmmmmmmmmm. Also, it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> This really seems to work. I&#x27;m not sure if it makes hair APPEAR thicker or if it actually spurs growth. Either way, you&#x27;ll look better. I have thinning hair that is fine in texture. I don&#x27;t know how it works for other hair types.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 3 months now. I definitely see new hairs growing and my hair loss has been reduced somewhat, but its not anything dramatic. The shampoo itself is quite hydrating and cleans very well. Dont expect big result.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for almost two weeks and I surprisingly found that the I grew some soft hair!! The hair looks more dense! When I wash my hair with this shampoo, it prevents the loss as well. I will keep using it and hopefully it can also help you to improve the quality of the hair!</li>
    <li> It made hair less smooth feeling during wash, but became normal when the hair was dry even I did not use conditioner. The hair does look more volume after wash. I found less hair on the floor when styling. And I feel good with NO SLS. I will keep using that and ask my husband to try it.</li>
    <li> It made my hair softer and reduced hair loss.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I have used so many products before and so far, this is the one I am liking the best. I just started using this shampoo product recently and I really like it. It makes my hair feel a little fuller and it seems to be working. I will continue using the product for now and I hope that it will yield good results for me. It also helps condition my hair so it won&#x27;t be very dry.</li>
    <li> Had it for about one month. Don&#x27;t use it every day but have not seen a noticeable difference as far as hair lose.  Definitely makes my hair fell cleaner but I&#x27;m still losing more hair then I would like everyday.  So, for me, it has not done what I was expecting.  I will start using it everyday and update my review if things change.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair felt after using the product for a week.</li>
    <li> A great product that will help slow or stop hair loss. After using this product for 4 weeks, I have noticed a decrease in hair loss. Only time will tell if I see new hair growth. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this with the Premium Organic Conditioner.  Tried for the first time today.  So far, pleased with the smell, lather and feel of both of these products.  Looking forward to using more.</li>
    <li> it is an awesome product as described...on my first application and showed very promising result! shipped and delivered prompytly</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo and the conditioner for two weeks now. I purchased these products trusting the 5 rate comments. These products dry my scalp, and I feel my skin burning after using the shampoo. My hair is dryer than ever and I am still losing a lot of hair. I decided to stop using them.</li>
    <li> So far i am loving this product. I have used it for 3 weeks, every day.  I have noticed not as much hair loss. Must use conditioner though. Is not oily nor filled with heavy perfumes.  It lathers suprisingly well with just one pump. I do leave it on a full 2 minutes before rinsing and applying conditioner.</li>
    <li> This my second bottle after 4-5 months. I sheaved my head 6 months ago  ( it is good for you hair) and started applying this shampoo without SLS, paraben etc..  my hair regrowth thicker  and I have 10-15% more hair and more volume. it was a combination of everything: shave,  organic shampoo without chemicals, eat healthy,organic multivitamins, I bought and organic dandruff shampoo as well you want your follicles clean and clear when hair is regrowing.  this one Its a buy forget about the price.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from Alopecia Aerta for years - bald spots that occur randomly throughout my scalp.  This has been very embarrassing and I have tried to hide my bald spots by wearing headbands, etc.  I have tried several products including shampoos, creams, oils, and the only thing that seems to help is Cortisone Shots.  Not real excited about the shots since they thin out the scalp and leave my scalp feeling dented.  Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo was featured on Groupon for a great price.  After reading the reviews I thought I had nothing to lose - well, except more hair!  I have been using this product for just over 2 months and I am so very pleased with the results.  My hair which is normally very fine is thicker, shinier and has more volume.  More importantly, my 3 bald spots have filled in with new hair.  Even my hairdresser who only uses Aveda products in her salon, can&#x27;t believe how Healthy my hair is and she could not find my bald spots from my last appointment which was only 5 weeks ago.  The 16 oz bottle goes a long way - just over 2 months and the bottle is still more than 1/2 full. I love the fact that this product is Organic.  Although I will look for another deal on Groupon, I would gladly pay the full price for this product because IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> After a week definitely less hair in the drain and brush. Hair is little dry, use a good conditioner with this.</li>
    <li> I was taking a supplement that made me lose hair and I quit taking it so i dont need this particular brand but this stuff is still good.</li>
    <li> So far hair loss may be lessening slightly, but I&#x27;ve only been using for less than 2 months.  Has none of the products that are recommended to avoid, &amp; I feel great about using natural ingredients on my hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is very nice quality, smells and feels great, leaves your hair feeling good too. But after 3 or 4 months of use I see no difference in hair loss rate.</li>
    <li> good smell,controls itching! better than other used.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for less than a week so far, but it definitely feels great after using the product. So far no result but I&#x27;ll update this review when there will be some.</li>
    <li> Very good. Stop losing hair now!</li>
    <li> So far the product is just fine.  It suds well and makes my hair feel clean.  It is cheaper then Nioxin and I am hoping that it will do better in the hair loss area but I will have to wait a while to find out.</li>
    <li> It sure doesn&#x27;t do much for hair loss! In fact you can but shampoo with Argan oil in the stores now...</li>
    <li> My friend recommended it to me and I decided to try a little bit of his one day. The next day when I showered without even any shampoo yet I noticed less than half the amount of hair in my hands then usual. Got me so excited that I had to buy my own bottle and hoping it solves my worries.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  Have noticed hair is fuller and thicker since started using.  Happy with purchase, and will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product has worked for me.. I noticed less hairloss since I&#x27;ve started using it. I plan to purchase item again.</li>
    <li> The smell is little like medicine but not that bad, sometimes I like it a little medicine smells it makes me feel like a good treatment. When I use it to wash my hair, it&#x27;s comfortable. You don&#x27;t have to press a lot once and massage your head when washing your hair. I just use it for two times so I did not see the effect by now but I believe it will improve my hair loss problem.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and use it every time. It smells good and makes my hair feel good. I don&#x27;t know if it will slow hair loss, but its worth trying as its a nice shampoo.</li>
    <li> I like it so far.  Suds well and smells good.</li>
    <li> Got this item on Saturday afternoon and could not wait to give it a try on Saturday night. I can not tell how it helps from hair loss now, but it leaves my hair a smooth, shinny and controllable feeling as you know my hair is very thick and dry. I have a little bit hair loss problem I hope this product could help me reduce the loss as most of the reviews said. Will try it a couple more times and then I will think about purchasing a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, which means I&#x27;ve used it about 3 times already. While it obviously has not completely cured any hair loss issues, I have definitely seen a decrease in how much hair I am shedding. I haven&#x27;t been using any conditioner, but I do not feel like my scalp has been dryer because of that. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair has more body. I look forward to seeing more progress the longer I use it.</li>
    <li> great shampoo,rich lather. leaves scalp with a feeling of freshness</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Smells good. I was using Nioxin but switched to this and I am truly satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over 3 weeks now, and I must say, I have noticed some improvement in my hair. It&#x27;s definitely been getting better although it&#x27;s too early to judge fully, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Don&#x27;t know the effect yet. Heard that it works</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased the pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo and I love it. It&#x27;s very gentle on the scalp and makes my head feel fuller. You&#x27;ll notice right away at how much hair you DONT watch go down the drain. No harsh chemicals and all ingredients are organic. This is a must buy, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It is very helpful for my hair. After using it few days, my hair loss treatment improved obviously . And my hair condition improved.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Very little hair loss during shampoo.  It was a recommendation by Amazon and I have been very pleased with it...this is my second bottle.  As a Senior Citizen, I strongly recommend it for thinning hair or hair loss..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair hasn&#x27;t continued to thin while using Pura d&#x27;or, or has at least slowed. I would recommend this product. Also, a lot of the shampoo at each use isn&#x27;t necessary, so the bottle really lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after taking a medication that made about half of my hair fall out.  Since using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed less hair loss.  I also like the fact that I only have to shampoo once to get my hair squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> It smells so good. This is the best best hair fall prevention shampoo i have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great product.... I love the way it smells and makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. No more hair at the drain. My hair looks and feels amazing. I would recommend this to everyone. i also use the Pura d&#x27;or conditioner. I finally found what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> YES, IT WORKS!!!  I buy TONS from Amazon and this will actually be my first review, I know, I know, it&#x27;s terrible, especially since we gain so much from customer experience, will definitely try to change that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But back to the matter at hand, this shampoo is really heaven sent.  I started noticing some thinning, which to this day I can&#x27;t tell you where my hair went since I never experienced any shedding, due to a beta blocker temporary medication I was taking for my anemia.  But since my, down to my waist, hair was so incredibly thick, it took me almost a year to realize what was happening.  (So thick I had to shave the back of my head, as if I had a bob haircut, in order to wear it down and my fam always said I couldn&#x27;t possibly get lice because they wouldn&#x27;t find a way to my scalp, lmao!).  Like many of you I FREAKED and started the research, smoothies and vitamins route.  I also got the many you&#x27;re crazy I don&#x27;t see it comments, but even though nobody could see it YET, I refused to wait until they could!  Unfortunately, nothing gave me noticeable results.  Then, one night, while searching for the 1000000000 time on Amazon, I came across this GEM, and due to the wonderful reviews, I decided to give it a shot...SO GLAD I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it ONLY 3 times and already see results!  After the first use, the fullness was visible, my scalp felt so much better and refreshed and 2 days later the hair sprout began!  After the second use my crown was no longer visible!  It leaves your hair fuller, healthier, shinier and SUPER soft!  (FYI: Results will vary since my hair grows super quick and the thinning never affected the growth, just the volume.  Also note that it may be a combination of things I&#x27;m doing, of which I&#x27;ll discuss below.  That said, no other products I&#x27;ve tried gave me these results!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Few TIPS:  Since I usually wash my hair 2 times a week, in between those days I applied the shampoo directly on my problem areas daily and even used it as hair gel when slicking hair back for a ponytail.  This way I could get as much of the exposure as possible without stripping my hair oils with excessive washing.  (FYI: If you have issues with sebum accumulation, you&#x27;re better off avoiding this TIP!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In ADDITION To The Shampoo I Have Also Recently Added:  Biotin (10k for the last 3 months), Prenatal Gummy Vitamins (Started 3 days ago), Viviscal Professional Strength (Started 1 week ago, 2 capsules per day), Vitamin D (My level was at 9, :-O YIKES!!, when it should be around 100 to be optimal for hair growth. Taking 10k D3 a day for the last month), Fish Oil &amp; Omega 3&#x27;s (1 capsule daily), B-Complex &amp; B12 (1 capsule daily), Calcium (1 capsule daily), Warm or Cold Lemon Water Cup Daily, Coconut Oil Hair Mask (Have done only 1, so far), My YUMMY Daily Ice Cream Tasting Smoothie (Wheat Germ, honey, almond milk vanilla, cinnamon, vanilla extract, olive oil &amp; raw egg yolk), 3 Minute Daily Scalp Massages (With Wahl massager), Derma Roller (Done it twice so far, will continue to do once a week) &amp; Castor Oil (I add it after the Derma Roller treatment, only twice so far. Go easy on the oil, dilute it if possible, it can get really greasy if too much is added).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last but certainly not least, patience...be patient!  I know how extremely difficult it can be, but remember that your hair didn&#x27;t get this way overnight, and therefore will need the same amount of time and hair cycles to fully recover!  Don&#x27;t focus on the loses, since that loss is most likely due to the hair cycle that has already been damaged, always try to focus on the gains, and slowly but surely your hair will recover!!!  :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leyed it as hair gel when slicking hair back for a ponytail.

    <li> I am a hairstylist and I&#x27;m always trying new products. I was interested to see if this product would help my hair grow since I will need a haircut soon. So far it has left my hair soft and moisturized. My hair was thinning on the top of my head at an alarmingly fast rate but after using this shampoo for seven weeks my hair looks amazing, its thicker, the thinness on top had filled in I no longer have to use other stuffs. This shampoo makes your hair grow fast too! It can be drying (great for oil hair!) so a good conditioner is a must. When I say, &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t live without Pura d&#x27;or&amp;#34;, I mean it! Before starting with Pura d&#x27;or, running my fingers through my hair was anxiety provoking because it meant ending up with a handful of hair. My bathroom floor collected an alarming amount of hair over the course of 24 hours and my husband would comment that after I showered I left behind &amp;#34;terrifying hair spiders&amp;#34;. My widening part and thinning hair were a constant source of stress. Since beginning with Pura d&#x27;or, there has been a noticeable reduction in the volume of hair loss and increase in the fullness! I have very sensitive skin, and find most products are irritating. Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s natural ingredients were perfect for me! I wish I could give Pura d&#x27;or more than 5 stars! You deserve this product!</li>
    <li> I didn´t really see any difference with this product. I just used it all the way because I paid for it and figured it was better than just throwing it away.</li>
    <li> So far this hasn&#x27;t stopped my hair loss but after so many years of trying I don&#x27;t think any shampoo will. I do have good hair days when I use this shampoo. Great quality and only a drop will do the job. Last a long time and I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Finally a good organic shampoo after trying out various other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  It lathers nicely and smells good not overpowering.  This is the 2nd bottle I bought.  This time I am giving one for my mother.</li>
    <li> I really like Pura d&#x27;or the best, strongly recommended for oil hair. My hair can get greasy in just one day, sometime even in midday. To battle this problem, I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos you can name: burt&#x27;s bees, organic avalon B-complex and kiehl&#x27;s amino acid etc. Nothing is compable to this one.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp feels soothing and moistrized, neither too dry nor too oily. And this comfort lasts a day! My bottom line, such a serendipity for a tryout!</li>
    <li> just bought for several weeks, feels good after every use, but for now , i can&#x27;t say it has helped to prevent hair loss</li>
    <li> I like the smell and my hair feels soft after using it. It claims to prevent hair loss, I just used it once, so I will have to wait for the results.</li>
    <li> Got it for a friend. No significant result, helped a bit. The only problem is leaves scalp a bit dry.</li>
    <li> it really works! it really make the hair stronger! highly recommend to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I notice my hair is becoming thinner since last year, I&#x27;ve tried many methods, finasteride (propecia), minoxidil, ginger juice, you name it. I didn&#x27;t see much improvement. So I brought this best-seller in shampoo not for complete restoration of my hair, but just with the wish to limit the hair loss. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and I wanna share my initial experience here.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:1. Mild formula, I feel not irritation at all&lt;br /&gt;2. Herbal extract, it smells a little bit like my pimento oil.&lt;br /&gt;3. Low silicone component. Many products contains silicone relative chemical substance to make your hair looks softer and smooth, but trust me, it is not healthy for your hair in the long term. Don&#x27;t be deceived by the appearance.&lt;br /&gt;4. Deep clean effect.&lt;br /&gt;5. Light weight bottle, easy to carry if you are usually on business.&lt;br /&gt;Con:1. The bottle is too light, easily tips over&lt;br /&gt;2. The clean effect is good, but your hair feels a little bit dry the next day, at least for my hair. But it is good for oil control.&lt;br /&gt;I will update the anti-hair loss effect of this shampoo. Three months is the minimum time required for observing the effect so I am not gonna give you a abrupt judgement on that. This one looks so similar to the anti dandruff, I put my comment in the wrong place previously.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 3-4 weeks. I see the results are amazing and my hair fall is reduced noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried lot of shampoos but this is shampoo which has given me good results. With the conditioner and Shampoo combo will ultimately make your hair really soft and easy to comb. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo last week and I love the smells of it&lt;br /&gt;It smells like combination of herbs which might be unsuitable for some people&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I purchased it is because of all the positive review posted on amazon&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t see any improvement yet but I have a good feeling about this product</li>
    <li> Overall great shampoo, great scent and mild formula.</li>
    <li> Oh, my god! It is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried a number of hair loss prevention shampoos, but likes pura d&#x27;or the best.  It makes his hair feel thicker and fuller without leaving any residue.  He also likes the smell of the shampoo and how it lathers well.  Although it&#x27;s a little expensive, it is worth the price and we like how the ingredients are natural and free of parabens and SLS.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for two weeks, good results, much hair loss. I will be insist on using it, hope better results.</li>
    <li> It does work since I use it. and I&#x60;m satisfied  with the delivery very much,just took 2days.It should worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> The smell is new to me, but totally fine as it is not bad. More importantly, I can really see my hair loss reduced by checking the tub after showering. It is exactly what I am looking for. Nice!</li>
    <li> I love it and its a everyday shampoo</li>
    <li> My hair is getting thinner since I am in 30&#x27;s. It is kind of scary to me. I started to use this Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo with conditioner 1 month ago. After the first time use, I found the hair in my bathroom is much more less than before. I use it every 2 or 3 days, and I feel the shampoo and the conditioner working well together. The shampoo is rich in foam and easy to rinse off. I didn&#x27;t feel I get more danduff. I will use them longer time to see if I can keep my hair more.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL THICKER, AND I THINK IT STOPS HAIR FROM SHEDDING I DON&#x27;T SEE MUCH HAIR IN THE SINK, I LOVE THE FEEL OF MY HAIR AFTER I USE THISS SHAMPOO.  I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> great for baby fine blonde hair! keeps it clean and free of ingredients that weigh down hair or make it clump together...you def see much less breakage and hair just seems thicker...prolly not the best for advanced baldness but slightly thinning hair a plus</li>
    <li> You got to be kidding. This is a joke. After brief use it did absolutely nothing. Save your money. I don&#x27;t know what they base their claims on, but they sure don&#x27;t work on my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I was losing my hair by the bunches and was very  concerned about it. Read the reviews and decided to try it.  It takes about a month to start seeing results but it works amazing. Just finished my first bottle which lasted about 4 months.  My hair hasn&#x27;t  been this healthy and shiny in so long.  I see a strand or 2 fall off when I blow dry but other then that it doesn&#x27;t fall if I just brush. Unlike the massive amount I was loosing each time I passed my hand through my hair before. Totally worth a try.</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning so I decided to buy this after reading the positive feedback hoping some sort of improvement but after over two months of following the directions... my hair is still thinning and falling out.  The bottle shown is also faulty, I received my package with shampoo spilled and the nozzle constantly spilled shampoo so I replaced the bottle entirely.  I didn&#x27;t decide to contact Amazon simply because I was desperate and the amount of spilled shampoo a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of shampoo&#x27;s in my time and others that I&#x27;ve used work a lot better than this one.</li>
    <li> Fair smell, not too bad. Leaves hair feeling healthy !</li>
    <li> Had it for a couple of weeks and one thing I do notice is that my hair feels fuller with more body after washing it.  I&#x27;m still not sure what conditioner to use, but overall, this seems to help with not so much hair falling out.  I hope this works in the long run.  I&#x27;m satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> My wife started losing her hair after a major surgery and we tried Pura d&#x27;or.  It makes her hair feel fuller and healthier and actually seems to have greatly reduced the hair loss, to a point where it is hardly noticeable.  Our son, who has a problem with his scalp and oiliness in his hair, also tried it and his hair looks much cleaner and healthier now, as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month and the half. It feels very gentle on the scalp and it leaves my hair feeling clean. My hair does seem to be falling out lesser and i&#x27;m liking it. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this product and decided to give it a try. After using it for a few weeks, I can definitely see a difference. My hair seems healthier and stronger. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work, so it has been a good surprise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month.  It smells good and it leaves my hair feeling clean.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo I can honestly say that I have less hair falling out as I comb and style my hair.  It is a great product!</li>
    <li> It really works for my hair! I will recommend it to my friend.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I absolutely see the magic of preventing hair loss.  I will continue using this product and highly recommend to whoever may has the need.</li>
    <li> FAKE REVIEWS&#x3D;SUSPICIOUS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking at some reviews and noticed a whole bunch of reviews posted in the last couple of hours by people who only have one review of a product- this one. This is really frustrating when you are trying to use the reviews to get some information. BUYER BEWARE.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and I love it.  The smell is wonderful.  It leaves my hair very soft and clean feeling.  I feel like when I get out of the shower I have been loosing less hair than prior to use.  I would recommend this product for hair loss prevention.</li>
    <li> Love this product I bought it for myself for dandruff and to prevent hair loss. I noticed no more dandruff and less hair loss. My fiancée started using it as well and noticed his hair grew faster, thicker and fuller. It&#x27;s a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Product worked wonders for my thinning hairline. It arrived earlier than expected A+ on the delivery.  Noticeable results within the first few days.... Hair loss is now a thing of the past for me.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase and will continue to buy</li>
    <li> From only a few washes. Less hair is seen in the sink. Let&#x27;s see</li>
    <li> It dries out my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 and I&#x27;ve been dealing with some major hair shedding and thinning due to stress, hormonal issues (PCOS), and going off birth control. I basically have hair like a toddler -- fine, thin, flat, lifeless. While I can&#x27;t say this is a miracle product, I can say it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, by far. I&#x27;ve been seeing some regrowth around my hairline, which means there is surely some throughout my hair. But what is definitely noticeable -- even after a week! -- was how quickly my hair STOPPED shedding. My drain rarely has to be cleaned, there is much less hair on the floor and in the sink, and my hair feels and looks great for the first time in a long time! I wish I&#x27;d found this stuff sooner! I plan on continuing use and trying the conditioner!</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo for about a month and really like it. It lathers very well, just 1 pump worth of shampoo is all that is needed. Makes my hair feel good. Time will tell if it actually reduces hair loss, but will likely continue using it regardless. I like the fact that is organic.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  I was skeptical about it at first.  After using it for the first time, my hair felt fuller and less oily than normal.  I especially experience my hair being oily after wearing a ball cap and after using this shampoo I do not have that issue.  As far as new hair growth, we will see in the future.  All in all, I love this product and recommend you giving it a try!</li>
    <li> I really lovin it. it saved my hair from loss a lot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks since I have started using it and I can already see the changes. My hair looks more voluminous and when I comb my hair after shower, there is definitely less hair fall. The only thing missing is conditioning. I do feel the need to condition my hair after a wash from this shampoo. And I also love the herbal fragrance. Overall, a nice product and I am starting to like it!</li>
    <li> I would like to give this shampoo 4 star,I have tried number of shampoo brands but none of those made my hair so soft and silky.I could see less number of hair strands in shower on day one itself.If I talk about my hair conditions then I have oily scalp ,fine hair and dandruff too.Just one thing I would like to add is the price,shampoo is a bit costlier but still I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough for a complete review but so far I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair feel thicker.  I love that there is no SLS or parabens.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already bought another bottle as a gift.</li>
    <li> Love love love this shampoo, it does work and I notice it has slowed the hair loss. It has an herbal smell but it doesn&#x27;t dominate your hair , after you rinse it&#x27;s fine. Makes hair shiny and it lathers well too!</li>
    <li> I just got this shampoo and tried it for the first time. My hair feels strength and it smells nice.expecting growing more hairs. I would recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product daily for 11 days, but the number of hairs that I shed each day has decreased. The lather and scent are very pleasant and it leaves my hair looking more full and manageable. I can&#x27;t claim that I am regrowing any new hairs yet, but I hope that the decreased shedding trend continues with continued use. It has also reduced some itching that I was experiencing. I recommend this product to anyone who wants clean, manageable hair and a healthy scalp.</li>
    <li> I have curly long hair and this pura d&#x27;or product give my lots of body and doesn&#x27;t make it dry. Within a few times of using this product I noticed that My hair stopped falling off.  I truly love this product and I would recommend it to everyone regardless of their hair type.</li>
    <li> This product made me start losing hair more.  I never used to shed hair, after using this shampoo I was seeing hair come out every time I ran my hands through my hair.  I contacted company directly and they refunded me after providing them with my receipt from amazon.  If you have a problem with thinning hair this is not a good choice.  Rowenta hair products, nioxin have worked, the only reason I tried this was because to avoid chemicals.  Lush makes two shampoo bars that also I was happy with.  At all costs do not waste your money on this.  I do not know how and why it was rated number 1 on amazon.</li>
    <li> I am using this shampoo for about a month. This shampoo is mild and since it has argan oil in it, it does not leave my hair dry even if I do not use conditioner. It does not strip off the natural oil from scalp like other chemical shampoos. But I have not seen a lot of difference in my hair fall since I have started using it.&lt;br /&gt;If it does not make any difference at all by the time I finish the bottle then I might switch to something cheaper.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after did a some research on choice of sulfate free shampoo. It is more expensive than shampoo I used, but tend to be on the cheaper end compared to some other shampoo with similar function to prevent hair loss. I tried some sulfate free shampoo in local grocery store about half the price before, but this one is much more gentle on the scalps. My head don&#x27;t get itchy and oily as before. It stays good volume. The hair looks more healthier and feels softer. I lost lots of hair under stress before, this shampoo seems to be lessening the issue, I got some small hair growing back, but I will need more time to tell. The shampoo really smells good, unlike some artificial chemical smell in a lot of cheap shampoo. Amazon seems to sell it at a much cheaper price than other places.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the Shampoo. The bottle is actually a bit smaller than I thought. Overall it is a nice product for thin hair person.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle and I was skeptical that I would get results, but I figured it was worth a shot. You know nothing ventured nothing gained. Wow was I surprised when I actually noticed the change in my hair - fuller, less breakage - not that fine stringy texture I had been dealing with. Even my hairdresser noticed the difference and asked me what I was doing differently. My sister suffering from similar problems bought a bottle after she saw my results. Now I&#x27;ve bought two more bottles. What can I say - THIS STUFF IS OFF THE CHAIN.....!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t have SLS and Paraben.  It also contains Argan oil which I find works well on my skin.  Therefore I assume that it should also work well on the hair.  I have used this product for three weeks and so far so good.  I will need to use it for a longer period to find out the hair loss prevention effect.</li>
    <li> So I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for about a week and a half now.  While I can&#x27;t say that it regrows hair as it has not been long enough, what I can say is that the product does make your hair fuller.  I have long curly hair that most shampoo and conditioner does not work well with so I had my trepidation about using the product especially at $20 a bottle.  Thankfully the product works really well with curly hair.  It does not weigh my hair down or leave it oily looking.  It leaves it soft and manageable. Yeah...weird for a guy to say that but I&#x27;m a musician what can I say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have commented on the smell of the product and I know everyone&#x27;s sense of scent is different.  I think it leaves your hair with a nice clean smell and have had people comment how nice my hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh...one other thing...before I forget.  I have also noticed a much smaller dreaded &amp;#34;Drain Monster&amp;#34; so it is definitely helping keep the hair I have.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. The consistency is thick and creamy. It smells so good, I&#x27;d go so far as to say the aroma itself is nourishing. It leaves your hair voluminous. I have not been using it consistently enough to speak if it&#x27;s true results, but I do notice new, fine hair growth in areas that were thinner before. This may be due to use in conjunction with other products. I will say that I have had minor hair thinning issues for a while and have extensively researched diets, supplements and topicals to prevent its advancement. Many of the ingredients in this product are the botanicals found to best treat this issue naturally. I&#x27;m hopeful it&#x27;ll continue to improve the condition.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I ordered.  I really like the way my hair feels now.  I also use the conditioner.  My hair does not break off as it did when I used other shampoos and conditioners.  Great product.  The shipment arrived in a timely manner and when promised. What more can I say.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is really fantastic shampoo. It really leaves my hair feeling light and clean. The argan oil is a pretty unique ingredient and I think that helps with the overall feel of this shampoo. I&#x27;ve bought a few of these now, and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance, and it calms my frizzy hair. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be stopping my hair loss, but I have only been using a couple times a week for a month, so perhaps I need to use it more to see results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and half, and so far I can&#x27;t tell any difference. At least that means no more conspicuous hair loss. I wonder, however, why it doesn&#x27;t produce rich lather. Is that good, or is it my hair?</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the organic smell... But it actually makes your hair smells clean and fresh!! I noticed my hair fuller and less hair coming out when I brush it. This is the most I ever spent on a shampoo... But I&#x27;m glad I did ... It makes me feel better that I know that the shampoo is organic and I&#x27;m not adding too much chemicals on my hair everyday.</li>
    <li> It works! It really makes your hair stop thinning and more volume.. MAGIC IS REAL!</li>
    <li> My Boyfriend just love it! This is his second time to buy this!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for about 6 months now.  It does not irritate my scalp and leaves my hair looking fuller.  One should not expect that one single component can &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; hairloss as healthy eating, restoring vitamin deficiency, stress control and keeping hormones in check are all contributors for hairloss.  However, having a quality shampoo with no harsh chemicals should definitely be part of your repertoire. I have long hair and the 16 oz bottle is generous and lasts around 3 months.  My only wish is that it would smell more tropical like coconut or melon.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on my hair and virtual no strands of hair in my comb after shampooing.  Also there was no strong scent at all while shampooing just a light clean scent when I blow dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product    smell just like \\&quot;Organic\\&quot;, Like it so far!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and am already experiencing noticeably less hair loss!</li>
    <li> I got it today and tried once, hope it works.</li>
    <li> After losing my hair through chemo, it grew back, but it was noticably thin on the top.  As I was looking for products to help me with my thinning hair, I saw this product referred to in several reviews.  I figured I would try it and see it if would help.  And, it did.  I did not use any other product in my hair and noticed that my hair was fuller.  It is not a miracle shampoo, so don&#x27;t expect dramatic results.  But, I could tell a difference and so far, it&#x27;s the best that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a few times so far but i see results compared to my last generic shampoo. I believe that its a great product that helps with hair thickening and hair loss. I recommend it to anyone interested in helping themselves through the same situation!</li>
    <li> Love this product...leaves my hair very healty looking. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 weeks a lot of the shedding has already stopped 😊</li>
    <li> Great products, thank you very much. 100% will purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It strips your hair of any unwanted residue from hairspray, mousse, and gel.</li>
    <li> First time try it, it is good.</li>
    <li> The shipping speed is really fast. Other than that, it provides a good scent when using.</li>
    <li> After I gave birth to my second baby I was seriously suffering from a dramatic hair loss... it was horrible the amount of hair balls and the size of them every time I washed my hair; It got to the point where I didn&#x27;t want to wash it anymore because I was literally going bald.  I tried the shampoo and conditioner because I have heard lots about Argan oil in the past months; I was seriously impressed with the results from the first use to the point where I told my friend and she ordered it right away. She loves it and so does her husband.&lt;br /&gt;This product really helps to prevent the hair loss, I&#x27;m still using it and hoping it helps to grow back all that hair I lost. Definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> I brought this shampoo for hair loss after reading several reviews on amazon. I have been using it for 6 weeks and hair loss seems to be improving but I didn&#x27;t see any  difference in hair growth .I am not losing as much as I use to while brushing my hair everyday  but i am still losing when I Shampoo my hair .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it makes my scalp so clean and don&#x27;t weigh my hair down.I want to use this shampoo for few more months to see if it totally controls my hair loss.</li>
    <li> First time trying this product, shipping was quick, item arrived as specified. Looking forward for the results with time, the first wash feels nice and clean. Will recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> After first time use, I feel pretty good. The smell is ok, kind of peppermint smell. Amazon shipping is very reliable and fast.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. Since I used it, my hair is better. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This helped stopping my hair loss</li>
    <li> I love it, it works it make your hair look and feels thicker and if you dye your hair it doesn&#x27;t take out the color it last longer</li>
    <li> This product does the absolute opposite of what it&#x27;s meant to do!! This product is Terrible, I would sue them if I had the time and money.&lt;br /&gt; I bought this off of groupon and am very very angry I fell for this snake oil gimmicky product.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 months, the shampoo curdled into a funky mess, my husband shook it up and continued to use for next 3 months. It has rapidly cause his hair to FALL OUT in these 3 months. When I noticed it, I asked him to STOP using this horrible product. I will buy Revita for him again as that kind of worked for him last year.</li>
    <li> The Facts about this Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- This shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry the hair, if you clean your hair two times at once you got rather oily hair by the next day as of the fact it contains Argan oil which moisture the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- From the first use you notice less hair loss and it continue to be better after two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- It causes a shiny look on your hair and will definitely change the look of your hair after combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4- No harmful chemicals and you can notice from the smell of this shampoo and the softness of it on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5- No perfumes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6- It doesn&#x27;t claim it will regrow your hair but they are serious that their product prevent hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To best care of your hair we have tried their product Pura Argan Oil. Awsome for everything from feet to head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Shampoo Highly recommended for hair loss suffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend Revita but still Pura d&#x27;or is better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura D&#x27;or 473 ml is $37&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as of Revita 500 ml is 63$ which almost double the price&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Revita for 3 years without any regrowth results, you can look at my review 4 or more years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars, as I still looking for a hair shampoo can be a substitute of using Minox daily, personally I&#x27;m not using it for it&#x27;s side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> it died out my hair and made it feel a little stiff. It smells botanical, if you like that smell it works for you. I have been using it for about a month now and havent seen much of a difference. Its expensive and not that concentrated or great. I would pass on this product.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month and a half ago. I was very skeptical at first but now I see the results. When I would shower I would see some hair in and around the drain. I would also have hair on my hand when I would apply my hair pomade. Now the fallen hairs have been greatly reduced! I use this product twice a day along with Rogaine Foam and have seen great results. The only bad thing is that the bottle dispenser leaks if you don&#x27;t give it a good hard push. I will order a clear bottle next time to pour it in to prevent this.</li>
    <li> the smell is not like others, it smells like made of plants. The package is good and many people introduce it to me said it is useful. I hope it can change my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good hair loss shampoo for a long time. I&#x27;ve tried various brands over the counter, but I think this shampoo is the one I will be using from now on.  I have a noticeable thickness increase to my hair since using this shampoo for 3-4 weeks.  I still look closely at my hairline for new growth, but nothing yet.  I have also been using minoxidil, and the combination with this shampoo has slowed hair loss alot. I can&#x27;t give the shampoo 5 stars yet, but I will revise my rating after a few months.  By the way, I like the fragrance of this product. Not overwhelming, but earthy.</li>
    <li> I am going on a week now of using this product and so far so good.  It leaves my hair looking better than it did using other popular shampoos and it does it using organic ingredients.  I can&#x27;t tell yet as far as the hair loss prevention part goes, but I will write a follow up review when I figure that out.  It is a bit more expensive than most shampoos, but so far I can see it being worth it.</li>
    <li> I was searching for an organic chemical free shampoo and found this product online. I have been using it for the past one month. It offcouse increases volume and gives a nice shine to my hair. I do not need to use any conditioner with it as it leaves my hair fairly soft. It smells good too. I loss the max amount of hair when I wash it. I still have it but, with this shampoo, I think the amount has reduced. I still don’t see any new hair growth but I am positive that with the continued  use, my hair fall may stop and I may have new hair growth. Hence I have decided to use it for the next one year. I use it every other day when I wash my hair. The only problem I see is that it doesn’t help with treating dandruff. I have light dandruff and it gets bit itchy at times. Since this shampoo doesn’t help with preventing dandruff, I am using another organic antidandruff shampoo once in every week. But overall it’s a good shampoo and gives me satisfactory results so far. Hope it will give all the results, which the manufacturer claims, with continued use.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this shampoo for over two weeks and have definitely noticed less hair falling out for both of us (long and short hairs). Well, the price is more and more expensive now...</li>
    <li> Seems to be working good</li>
    <li> start to use, feel good!  and will continue to buy! AAAAAAA+++++</li>
    <li> after use the product for about a week, I have fewer hair drop in the morning when I comb my hair. I will continue use it to see the long term result.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo which leaves my hair looking healthy. I have not seen the benefits of regrowth yet. I have been using for almost 2 months now.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo for 2 weeks now, and have noticed less hair falling out when washing and combing my hair.  It left my hair feeling silky and smooth.  This product is very gentle to your hair, unlike other regular shampoos which has artificial harsh ingridients.  I will continue to use the product going forward.  This shampoo definitely is worth it, all natural, organic, great product if you love and care for your hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Amazing shampoo. Very effective</li>
    <li> This won&#x27;t be the case for everybody because different people have different reactions to various hair loss treatments, but for me this product has been miraculous. Only a week or two in and my hair has completely stopped falling. I used to run my fingers through my hair and have clumps of hair on my hand. I have now noticed a complete reversal. My hair is no longer shedding. I dont see hair on my hands when i shampoo, when i play with my hair, when i comb my hair, etc. I cant say it&#x27;ll work for everyone but at this low price its worth a shot simply because if the product happens to treat your specific cause of hairloss, theres a good chance itll work. Best of luck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this shampoo. It leaves my hair soft and smelling so good. It also gave my hair a noticeable healthier look. Totally recommended! My mom accidentally used it the other day, and she liked it so much she asked me to get her a bottle, so you who are reading this, should give it a try:)</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo! Ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has been less oily, I&#x27;ve been experiencing less hair loss and it just makes my hair feel super clean! It&#x27;s definitely worth the price and one bottle lasts for a while. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great premium shampoo for healthy hair.</li>
    <li> My hair appears to be thicker.  The shampoo and conditioner combination leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I used it once since I recieved it i the mail this weekend and already love this product! My hair looks and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> Where has this stuff been the last 6 years that I have been losing so much of my hair?  I normally lose handfuls of hair each time I shampoo and condition my hair and I counted 7 hairs after I used this stuff!  How does this work?  Whatever it does, I am sold on using it from now on!  It gives suds which surprised me and also smells nice.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting this shampoo to work up a lather at all.  I color my hair once a month and it has been &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; looking and dry.  After using the conditioner and shampoo together (only one time mind you!) my hair was silky to touch.  I found myself playing with my hair because it felt so good to touch.  I am loving this stuff!!!!!  I never send in reviews.  This one was so worth it to me that I had to share!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the reviews and it does not disappoint. I was skeptical because I have thin hair to begin with. I am about to turn 40 and have noticed the hair starting to come out after the shower when combing.&lt;br /&gt;To boot I have bad seborrhea dermititis which is the only thing I wish this product could help with. For that the only product non prescription I have found is DHS zinc shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I waited a bit over a month to write this review to see if it faltered. It doesn&#x27;t. This product does everything you will read about it and in virtually any of the reviews.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a huge change, but will continue to use the product in hopes of seeing a difference.  It has only been a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I think it works great....I used to used a different product (dark grey and orange bottle) and switched to this. I diffidently see better results than i did with other shampoo.  Best part it is all natural, just seems to work better than the other product i was using. I use with lipogaine and doing just fine.</li>
    <li> it is really good product. feeling very comfortable after i use it</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good to fight against hair loss, and my hair loss has stopped. It smells so good. Excellent Quality!!</li>
    <li> I used it for several days and my hair feels clean after using it. I used to loss hairs while washing and it did lose less with this shampoo, not sure after washing. I washed my hair everyday because it get oil every night. But after washing with this, the next still feels ok. I like this smell, soft, not too strong.</li>
    <li> This is the third bottle I had. I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic change of hair growth but I did notice that when I take a shower I have less hair loss (I guess they named the product right, hair loss prevention...).</li>
    <li> I have pcos and one of the side effects is thinning hair.  There is noticeable thinning hair on the crown of my head.  Because of the excess androgens, a lot of the pcos sites recommended an androgen blocker, or dht blocker, to help with the loss.  I researched dht blocking shampoos and most of them have sulfates, which I am sensitive to.  Then I found this shampoo.  It has natural dht blockers in it, like saw palmetto and nettles so I figured I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the shampoo, and it arrived quickly because of the prime shipping.  I started using it the next day.  A couple of things- I dye my hair red and I also use generic rogaine to help with the hair loss.  The shampoo, didn&#x27;t seem to fade my hair so that was great.  The rogaine helped with some hair loss, but the shampoo helped even more.  I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo only a couple months and I have baby hairs popping up in areas that had no hair.  I follow the directions- I shampoo my hair first thing in the shower and then leave it on my head.  I finish the shower and rinse out the shampoo last and then I use a leave in conditioner when I get out of the shower.  I love the smell of the shampoo- it smells like an herb garden!  I also love the lather in the shampoo.  I have chin length hair and I only need one of two pumps of shampoo and it lathers great when I first put it in my hair. I thought the shampoo was a bit pricey, but when I started using it, I found it was a good value.  I still have half a bottle after two months of use. Another good thing about the shampoo is that it cleans well without drying my hair.  Sometimes, I use sprays like My Secret Hair Enhancer to cover up the thinning spots.  The shampoo washes it out completely without leaving any spots of the spray behind on my scalp.  I gave this product four stars because the shampoo goes flat when it sits in your hair.  What I mean by this is that it loses its lather.  I like to let it sit and then lather it once more before rinsing, but it doesn&#x27;t always have lather left after sitting in my hair for a couple minutes. Also, when I received it in the mail, some of the product leaked from the bottle-not sure if that is a packaging complaint or something that the manufacturers can prevent.  Overall, I love the shampoo and I will definitely be purchasing it again!g, but it doesn&#x27;t always have lather left after sitting in my hair for a couple minutes. Also, when I received it in the mail, some of the product leaked from the bottle-not sure if that is a packaging complaint or something that the manufacturers can prevent.  Overall, I love the shampoo and I will definitely be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> Love the fact that this shampoo is full of quality products.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping me with the hair issue but I will continue to use it just based on ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great! I noticed my hair feels thicker and softer. I recommend for great quality.</li>
    <li> Having trouble with my scalp recently. Having mysterious bumps and making my hair fall. I&#x27;ve researched and researched and was led to this shampoo. My first use and I&#x27;m enjoying it! I have high hopes for this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Regardless if it works great or not, what a rich , thick, excellent scent shampoo.  This shampoo just feels good.&lt;br /&gt;Just after several washes, my hair feels great!!!!!</li>
    <li> the herbal smell is very good. hope it will work and i think it may take at least a week?</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t like the texture of my hair using this.</li>
    <li> smells like Chinese medicine. i like it.getting little warm when foaming.hope it will help with our（my husband and i)hair loss.</li>
    <li> It does work. The best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is great product. Even though it is a bit expensive, it was worth every dollar that I spent.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a pleasant minty fragrance, a small amount lathers well, rinses squeeky clean, and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> been using it for about 2 weeks. doesnt seem to be helping as of yet, hopefully it atleast slows things down a bit. But it smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> You will not regret purchasing this before trying a product made of chemicals and ingredients that will ruin your hair in the long run&lt;br /&gt;I think this is one product that you will be better off trying first, than trying those name brands. What I like about this product is that its all natural and safe for everyone to use. There is never a bad time to replace your old shampoo for something that can keep your hair from becoming lifeless and thinner. The added DHT blocker helps prevent hair loss, and the nourishing ingredients help feed the scalp and your hair to become shiny, full of life, bounce, and increase growth.&lt;br /&gt;When I used this product I notice after wards the shine that appeared due to the Argan Oil, one of the ingredients in the product. I also notice the nice smell and how soft my hair looked as well as how much more movement it had.</li>
    <li> Have to be honest..have been using this for a month now and have noticed no difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over three years and it really works for hair loss prevention. It doesn&#x27;t regrow thick hair like some have claimed, but it does leave your hair exceptionally soft and in your head.</li>
    <li> Awesome,  This stuff really works well.  I really pleased with the results.  I have been using for a month so far and the results are great!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and isn&#x27;t too drying. It definitely has a great natural smell to it rather then chemical. I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair falling out much either while on this product so that is great. I am definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was attracted by this product by its good review and gave a try since the price is reasonable.  This product has met my expectations as shampoo. I especially like the fragrance it carries, sort of conifer needles. When it comes to the acclaimed &amp;#34; Hair Loss Prevention &amp;#34; effect, I think that it may take longer time to give the conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;In general, I will recommended this product, and I will give my update on its hair loss prevention effect.</li>
    <li> I think the hair loss has slowed down drastically. This shampoo smells really great as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for roughly a year now. I have the typical male pattern balding where the centre of your scalp. As a remedy, I started using Rogaine (Minoxidil). From reviews on Rogaine&#x27;s page, I found this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any other remedy, you need to be patient! From the last few months, I have had people telling me that my hair is looking better. I&#x27;d say use this shampoo consistently for at least 6-8 months before expecting results. Try as many remedies as you can, and the combination is bound to work. And of course, don&#x27;t cut your hair too short!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck.</li>
    <li> This is best shampoo ever, quick delivery I used it twice already. I will re-post one more time, after a month.</li>
    <li> I had hair loss problem for 5 years especially on top of my head.  I washed my hair on daily basis so that I need a good quality shampoo.  I have used this product for 10 days now and It seems that less hair falling off when I wash my hair.  My hair is clean and fresh. I like nature products and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be better than my last shampoo. My hair just feels healthier.</li>
    <li> smells great! hope it works!</li>
    <li> *Updated 3/1/15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this for my mom. She has extremely sensitive skin and has broken out to other store bought products for hair loss or hair loss prevention shampoos I&#x27;ve gotten her. She&#x27;s lost a lot of hair due to medical reasons/ side effects of meds. Taking biotin has helped her to gain some sporatic hairs where there was previously none but not enough to really see without looking closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that since this is paraben and sulfate free, hopefully just getting her away from some of the chemicals would help stop further loss. She is hopeful also. I&#x27;ve purchased different essential oils to create her a DIY growth serum I&#x27;ve researched but am hoping this shampoo may  work on its own. Waiting to see. Will update soon if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely smells nice!! Bottle arrived leaking some into the box, maybe just a fifth of the product or so. Will buy again though if it even helps prevent further loss for my mom! Too soon to know, she just started using it this month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*3/1/15, Unfortunately, this shampoo did not work for my mom. She had an allergic reaction on the back of her head. She may be allergic to a main ingredient that is helpful to others (this has happened with all growth shampoos she has tried). Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times but my hair feels amazing!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for my hair, and the hair loss reduced after using this shampoo for a while, the foam is rich compared with other shampoo.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife and this is what she says:  Its just been around 3 weeks since I started using this shampoo, but I can see a significant difference in my hair texture.  The shampoo smells and feels good and the conditioner also has a pleasant scent. Hair loss has reduced and hair has become  more manageable. The shampoo is expensive but the results up till now are worth the price. Hoping a consistent improvement in  my hair with the help of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Don&#x27;t know if prevent hair loss yet, but it feels great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month since i start using this product. It did reduce my hair loss significantly, my hair looks shinny and feels healthier than before, I don’t have to clean up the drain every time I take a shower as I used to. Over all this is the best shampoo I have used so far.</li>
    <li> it smells good and the my hair felt smooth after using it. will see how it works on preventing hair loss in a long run</li>
    <li> I tried many shampoos out there but none of them worked as great as this one. After a month of use a noticed a big difference on my hair with no hair loss and it leaves me with the impression that my hair is thicker and more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy this little expensive shampoo but it was really worth it. If you look at the ingredients it explains why it is expensive. I feel now that I am stuck with it.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom，she loves it very much！she said that she used three times found that the hair loss less</li>
    <li> I  purchased this shampoo mainly for my 17 years old son who was experiencing thinning of hair. He saw significant improvement after just two weeks of use. He is not seeing hairs coming of on towel after shower. He is very happy. I will recommend this shampoo to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Hair is full and thick.  Just ordered my second bottle and the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who was complaining of his thinning hair.  He uses it every day and is happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I received shipment really fast great!</li>
    <li> Disaster! After three wash with this shampoo, my hair got thinner and thinner. They are all falling out now. How ironic! I want my money back.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend because he&#x27;s being paranoid about losing his hair. He uses it daily - it smells very earthy and natural. He also mentions that his hair feels softer than with normal shampoo. In terms of the hair loss effect, that has yet to be seen, although I am confident that it will work given the other good reviews. Happy wishes to myself and my boyfriend and wish us good luck on our (his) hair loss adventure!</li>
    <li> Great smell. Lathers well. Seems to do what it claims.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling so clean and shiny. My new favorite!</li>
    <li> I started noticing my hair thinning and falling down a lot in the past few year. I tried different products but non of them seem to work. Since I started using this shampoo I have notice that my hair don&#x27;t fall down as much as before.</li>
    <li> I am amazed, after only several shampoos, I can tell a difference. I was losing a lot of hair with each shampoo but now there is very little in the shower. I would recommend this to anyone losing hair!</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this product for my husband and he started using it for a while. His hair looks so smooth and nice. I would like to recommend it to people who don&#x27;t like to have their hair get harmed by chemical ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great natural ingredient shampoo. Does not dry my hair yet cleans well for an organic shampoo. Likes the smell too. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells good and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I just bought two bottles from Amazon for a first try. It looks good to me so far....</li>
    <li> I loss around 30 pounds in about 3 months then my hair started falling out. I tried Aveeda Invanti  system for about a month which dried out my hair and made it worse. I then read reviews for other products and decided to buy this one. I have been using it now for over a month and can tell a huge difference in my hair. It is soft and the shedding has reduced dramatically.</li>
    <li> The shipment is very quick! I used it several times already. It smells good. I like it.</li>
    <li> Stopped hair fall from first use</li>
    <li> Great shampoo with all natural ingredients that works very well on my hair. I can see a difference within a few days of use. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have only been using a short while.&lt;br /&gt;Hair loss will take some time to tell, but any help there will be welcome.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to leave my hair manageable, but this is true anytime I switch shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a fine shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair and scalp clean and oil free. I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals! I just started using it about a week ago, so we will see if it starts regrowing some hair soon!</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo I have ever used. A friend told me about it and I didn&#x27;t believe him when he told me it was good until I tried it. After using it for one week I am already starting to see hair grow back and the hair that is still there and has become much stronger. I highly recommend this shampoo to anyone that is having hair loss problems.</li>
    <li> this actually has definitely decreased my hair loss</li>
    <li> Really amazing product to use.&lt;br /&gt;Can see effects of it flowing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really happy to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product and buy it regularly, has no harsh chemicals and argan oil is keeping hair in great health</li>
    <li> I just tried this shampoo and so far it feels good, smells good, and makes my hair shine. Will try to update soon!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would thicken my thinning hair.  I am not sure I see any results and it is expensive.</li>
    <li> Only used it once but my hair is so soft....smootches.</li>
    <li> It seems to be cleaning my scalp and unclogging pores. I feel like my scalp is absorbing every thing I put on it faster. I had general thinning, along with an empty spot on the back of my scalp. I use Regenpure in the morning and this shampoo at night. My hair got thicker and I noticed the back spot is growing back. If you are completely bald, there is nothing in the market than can bring your hair back, other than hair transplant. if you still have hair and want to keep it, Regenpure and this shampoo are two good choices.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo for my husband but I have ended up using it too! At first, you may think you need to use a lot of it because it doesn&#x27;t foam like a lot of other non organic shampoos but I found after leaving it in your hair for a few minutes that it does feel clean and fresh and the argan makes it feel soft. So you don&#x27;t need to use but just a few pumps. I love the subtle smell it has. I also used the conditioner and when I combed through my hair after showering it combed through very easily! I would highly recommend this product!! I am always looking for products with no chemicals that do the trick and this is a wonderful product! Try the Argan oil too - I love it!!</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful smell and cleans hair very well. My hubby and I both use. It&#x27;s hard to find nice and effective products that do not contain parabens, but this does. Really really like it and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo regularly, over a period of 1.5-2 months and I am huge fan already. It has added noticeable shine and growth to my hair which is one of the best result I have got from any other shampoo in the market over last 2 years. I use this to wash my daughter&#x27;s hair too because it is organic and devoid of side effects from sulphate heavy products. The consistency is thick so a little goes a long way. I didn&#x27;t like the conditioner as much so I pair this with aveda&#x27;s conditioner. Together the due has given me fantastic results. I will soon start another bottle and am curious to see how it turns out in longer run.</li>
    <li> I cannot properly rate it because I just started using it.  Give me time let&#x27;s say at least a month.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels great in hair.  Gives lots of Body.  Spells great.  Nice dispenser.</li>
    <li> Hope soon grow more hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been losing my hair for a while thining. Besides using a couple different shampoos that suppposidly help stop or lower the hair loss this one definitely didn&#x27;t. This one actually dried scalpng making the roots of hair more damaged. Dries scalp really bad, and don&#x27;t suggest it, especially if you want to keep your hair. Didn&#x27;t see a decrease in hair falling out. I got off of it, and went back to head and shoulders then a regular moisturizing shampoo and most of my hair is healthy again.  Really disagree with this, and prefer using propecia or a perscription to maintain hair which has worked great!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best natural organic shampoo that I have come across. I notice less shedding and very little if any hair strands in the drain after I wash my hair. I have been using it for about 4 months and I noticed the difference in about a week. I&#x27;ve done many trial and errors with different hair loss prevention shampoos and this one comes out on top. At the end of the day, my hair still feels soft and clean as it did that morning after I had dried it.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this makes my hair look and feel, however, I do dye my hair and this strips all the color. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s intent is, to rid the hair of all chemicals. If my hair was NOT color treated I&#x27;d def use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I love it! This shampoo works fantastic! I&#x27;m in love with para d&#x27;or!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about others, of me this shampoo did not improve my hair loss problem at all. I still see a lot of hair in the shower after using this shampoo. Only change I have noticed after using this shampoo is my hair looks more dull and brittle. My quest for good hair loss shampoo is still on.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this shampoo long enough to judge how well it works to stop hair loss but my hair looks and feels great after using it. It smells wonderful, lathers well and rinses easily.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my hair feel great too! I think I&#x27;m starting to see a different in the amount of hair I&#x27;m losing. Plus it&#x27;s organic so that&#x27;s a huge benefit!</li>
    <li> As someone with thin, limp hair, I have noticed that my hair is stronger, thicker, and healthier looking while using this shampoo for the last month. I wash my hair every other day, but I could probably wash every 2-3 days because it just keeps my hair cleaner that much longer.  No other store-bought shampoo will create as much body, bounce, shine and strength in your hair as pura d&#x27;or…You feel it as soon as you wash and rinse your hair.  I&#x27;ll admit that  I was skeptical in the beginning, but it really works.  It&#x27;s also made with all natural ingredients unlike 99% of most over-the-counter shampoos.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but after about 3 months of use, this product has made my hair much better.  My hair since Fall 2014 had become even thinner than usual and extremely limp.  Nothing else I used seemed to work.  I thought my hair had a bit more lift and body after the first month, but waited until now - at 3 months to review.  I&#x27;m about to start my second bottle of this shampoo tomorrow.  Not sure what was going wrong with my hair but this stopped it.  It also seems very economical to use.  I wash my hair nearly every day and one bottle lasted 3 months!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my sister. still need time to see the effect.</li>
    <li> While the smell is nice, spend your money on another hair loss shampoo.  I was drawn by the great reviews, but now I&#x27;m wondering if they were &amp;#34;real reviews.&amp;#34;  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Did not like at all. I really wish I would have sent it back&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had 1.00 shampoos do more for my hair.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS TO TRY AND HELP WITH MY THINNING HAIR, I CAN&#x27;T SEE THAT IT HAS HELPED WITH THAT PROBLEM, BUT IT&#x27;S A NICE SHAMPOO</li>
    <li> This shampoo is definitely refreshing. Since I started using it I have not gotten dandruff.  When I use this shampoo I feel like blood is going to the roots of my hair. That&#x27;s what we need to prevent the hair loss. Overall it is a great product. I would not switch to another shampoo in the near future.</li>
    <li> Received the first bottle as a gift and it seems to be working better than other hair loss shampoo that I have used. I like the smell and bought some more.</li>
    <li> Does not regrow hair, but stops the shedding and thinning of hair. I would recommend this product to slow down that receding hairline on men.</li>
    <li> This is a new product for me; it&#x27;s a new brand for me actually.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks.  It&#x27;s difficult to say if it works to prevent hair loss, but it smells wonderful and makes my hair feel strong and healthy.  I like using the argan oil as I feel it delivers the much needed oil back to the hair as normal shampoo would strip it of.</li>
    <li> This is actually one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve used so far. I have gone through many drug store brands, as well as salon brands, but this one was one of the nicest. I like the smell of it, because it&#x27;s very herbal. A little also goes a long way, so I don&#x27;t buy it very often. In fact, I&#x27;ve had my same shampoo for 6 months now!&lt;br /&gt;It helps prevent TOO much hair fall. I still lose hair but not that much compared to how much I used to. All in all, a great buy and worth the money. I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> It costs a lot more than the typical shampoo, but given how long a bottle lasts and its ability to prevent hair loss it&#x27;s a worthwhile investment that I&#x27;ll continue to make.</li>
    <li> works great...cleans hair and scalp. smell good. only issue is the container and the pump you need to pump about 8-9 times to get enough shampoo for wash</li>
    <li> The shampoo is really nice. When I was buying the product, I was reluctant because of price. Now, I think it is worth product. It helps nourishing your hair and cleaning the scalp. It has essential ingredients to stop hair loss. It has reduced my hair loss.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but I don&#x27;t know that it does that much for the hair. It feels a little too thick to me.</li>
    <li> I tried using a lot of hair loss prevention shampoo but all of them did not yield the result I wanted. Not until I tried Pura d&#x27;or organic shampoo. It is effective, affordable and most of all, organic which means it is safe to use. I recommended this product to some of my friends and even to my boss and they were all glad with the results. I wish I could have known about this product sooner so that I did not waste my time and money buying any other products. Great product and really worth your budget.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my hair feel.  It seems that my hair is fuller.  Improving my loss of hair ...feel much better</li>
    <li> Well I cant confirm this stops hair loss the shampoo smells good and give a wonderful wash. It did make may hair feel thicker and more full bodied. So much so my hair cutter commented on it. Absolutely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always kept my hair long and it&#x27;s always fallen out when I brush it or style it, which seems to be normal. Lately it seems to have been falling out a lot more, so much so my hairstyle noticed. Amazon is currently my go-to place for beauty products. I found Pura D&#x27;Or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo and decided to order a bottle based on the reviews. I believe this product has helped. My measure of success? The hair on my bathroom floor. My hair feels thicker and all around nicer. I really like the scent of the shampoo--very herbally and refreshing. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost a month now. I&#x27;ll probably order another bottle to see if the result keep improving.</li>
    <li> I was freaking out because I thought I was about to be bald. Fortunately, I find this shampoo!!! I have been using it everyday for 1 month. My hair still falls but falls dramatically less. My tub hasn&#x27;t clogged this month which bothered me a lot in the past. I also recommended it to my friend. She experiences the same amazing effect. I am thinking about buying more during the promotion.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this to try to start doing something about my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, so far, today only marked my first use of the product. But, I think I am already starting to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell... certainly left my hair shiny and I think my scalp felt pretty refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I like the fact that it is organic. Marks my first time trying an organic shampoo of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I generally hold anything organic in higher regard than non-organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, I think this is a good product overall, and I would recommend others give it a try.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo about six months ago and it seems to have aided in hair loss prevention as well as made my hair thicker. As with any of these products it can be tough to tell exactly how effective it is since I don&#x27;t have an identical twin as a control group, but from simple observation, it appears to work as advertised. I have already purchased another bottle.</li>
    <li> I loved this shampoo.  The smell is great, the texture is clean and smooth, and left my hair feeling clean and voluminous.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wow! I found my new holy grail shampoo! The scent is mild and calming &amp; the larger is prefect!  My hair feels so wonderful after shampooing!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the shampoo for long, but my excessive hair loss has already stopped. As an added bonus, it also smells great.</li>
    <li> seems helpful but makes hair a little bit too dry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 2 months ago after noticing some hair loss due to a medication side effect. I noticed comments from other people saying that they didn&#x27;t even need conditioner, their hair was left really soft just using the shampoo. I found that to be true for the first 2 weeks. My hair was really soft, looked healthier and fuller (people even asked if I was doing something different). After about 2 weeks, my hair was really rough and hard to brush through after washing so I had to start using conditioner again and it hasn&#x27;t looked as good as it did those first couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;As far as stopping hair loss, I did notice a significant difference in how much hair was coming out in the shower. When I would normally get a handful of hair while squeezing water out, I was getting a few strands at most. Unfortunately, this improvement only lasted about a month. I&#x27;m not sure if the medication is winning out, or the shampoo has just stopped working but my hair is now coming out even more than it was before I started this and I&#x27;ll have to find something else to help.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see hair growing back as people in the other reviews said, but I do notice there&#x27;s less hair in my tub when I wash my hair. So, it probably works, but the effects may vary on people.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week and I couldn&#x27;t be happier if my hairline grew back in an instant. My scalp is noticeably more clear of DHT as promised and once my hair became accustomed to the new routine it&#x27;s feeling smoother and softer, even with this as my only product. Absolutely amazing product</li>
    <li> Worse shampoo ever!!! I had to throw it away after a month. The pump stop pumping because the shampoo turned out super thick. Then two phases started to formed inside the bottle. I shook the bottle  trying to mix the components back together but no success. I was exciting by the organic aspect but don&#x27;t get full this shampoo is not doing anything special. It drys your hair and leave no perfum or any advantages. This shampoo should be out of business !</li>
    <li> Feel  good with it. I will buy it again! But the bottle is little bit small than I thought.</li>
    <li> For the first few days of using this product, i was still having hair loss but gradually it started reducing and my hair does look voluminous. It would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I firstly did not really believe that it could actually help my hair grow back. My expectation was to prevent further hair loss. It totally surprised me after using it for a while. My hair gets cleaner and fresher after using it for a few days. And I could see baby hair coming out after using it for a period of time. I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am right now. YOU SHOULD TRY IT!!</li>
    <li> This product has a good smell, it cleans your scalp really well and it leaves a cool minty feeling. after the first use, my hair is not as flat as it used to be and it really calms down my scalp. I had dandruff from using Garnier  fructis, but it stopped after using this product.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Leaves my hair feeling so full and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products (coming from a true beauty product &amp;#34;junkie&amp;#34;) for hair loss and this is the first product which I can honestly say made an immediate impact. After the first use, I had a significant decrease in the amount of shedding in the shower, so much so that I don&#x27;t want to use any other product.  Now I only need to find something that could help spur the new hair growth cycle as fast and it would be true perfection!  Please don&#x27;t hesitate to try pura d&#x27;or shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good and after using for a period it really moisture the hair.</li>
    <li> Been experiencing hair loss for a while and it has gotten worse over the period using OTC products. After using this shampoo for two weeks on daily basis, hair loss has came down. Not noticing hair fall during combing anymore. Also hair is feeling silky and smooth after bath. I would certainly recommend this product, wish I have known about this one earlier.</li>
    <li> So I started losing hair in February this year. I had been losing hair before as well. But there was something drastic about it this time. They say you shed around 100-150 hair in a day but I was shedding that much at one time when I combed my hair. I tried all kinds of supplements. Iron, Vitamin D, B12, Biotin but nothing seemed to be working. Then I came across this shampoo as the best seller on Amazon. I have been using it for almost a month now and I would like to share my experience here.    After my first use my scalp definitely felt good but my head felt very heavy and had a headache that night and also throughout the next day.  After 1st week of use my hair felt good and I was most definitely shedding less. So much so that I started getting worried it was so potent it might have other side effects I was unaware of.  After 2 weeks of use my hair shedding had reduced to half but I started noticing subtle hair growth below my chin, on my neck and near my ear and side burns. ( I am a girl. ) This was definitely distressing for me. Hence, I did some research realized that the way this shampoo works is it acts like a vasodilator which means it expands your blood vessels and increases blood flow to the hair follicles. Unfortunately that works for vellus hair as well.    After 4 weeks I could definitely see increased HAIR GROWTH ON MY BACK AND NAPE OF THE NECK.    Also your HAIR LOSS WOULD RESUME if you stop using this shampoo. I don&#x27;t know what the potential long term effects of a DHT BLOCKER  are and if it is a LIFE LONG requirement.    Hence, I would recommend that use this shampoo on a trial basis for a month, observe if you are impacted by any potential side effects and only then proceed to use it long term.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks now. It creates lots bubbles and cleans my hair very well. I just noticed a slightly difference in my hair loss, i think it&#x27;s just too early to see the change. Anyways, i recommend it.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo to be extraordinary. It does seem to clean hair very well with no residue after rinsing. It has a pleasant scent and hair loss appears to be diminishing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair so smooth, and my hair feel really soft after I used it!</li>
    <li> This product is great smells good, my hair looks good and is managable. I hope this helps grow back hair, and/or reduces lost.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been three weeks, and I can already see noticeable growth!  I have fine hair and I&#x27;m usually a bit thin along my part in the front of my head.  There&#x27;s several baby hairs sprouting from all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the scent too.  My boyfriend is constantly sniffing me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the conditioner too.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this shampoo for too long so it&#x27;s difficult to rate it, but so far, i really like it. My wife likes it too.</li>
    <li> This product is truly fantastic. I have used other shampoos in the past with promises of thicker, fuller hair, however pura d&#x27;or has been the first product where I have seen noticeable improvements in the first week. Very pleased with this shampoo. In fact, my whole family loves this shampoo due to the way it smells and makes your hair feel. The only shampoo we will be using from now on.</li>
    <li> 3 weeks in and so far we have nothing negative to say.  We like to use our own deep oil conditioning concoctions which can even involve castor oils-  which leave the hair really greasy -  amazingly it gets it all out with one wash.  The sulfate free conditioning cleanser we were using couldn&#x27;t get those oils out.  So thats a bonus.</li>
    <li> I like that it is organic and started using it a few days ago. So far I like the shampoo but will give it some time to see the end result and difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this with lot of hopes, however i have intuition that it will work as i am seeing few new hairs but not visible as such. wishing to continue to see &amp; feel the difference, i can update my review after few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Sayeed</li>
    <li> This shampoo does work!! I buy it for my boyfriend. It is useful and no odd odor. It is incredible. About a year ago some medication caused his hair to thin significantly, and although it has been slowly growing back, he was still losing more hair in the shower than I would like. After only two weeks of using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo every day, my hair looks fuller, thicker, and healthier than ever! And I want one more for my father!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchasing this product from amazon,  and this shampoo works great for both men and women in household.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shampoo so I&#x27;m not sure if it works for thinning hair or not yet. Although, for a shampoo without all those chemicals in it I was delighted that it lathered up so well. My hair feels really clean.</li>
    <li> I have got the product for about a week and overall it works very well. My hair is less oily after I use the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have so far is the smell is a little wired for me.</li>
    <li> Good product for a good price. Will update when use for a longer time.</li>
    <li> Not sure how effective it is for thickening hair, but at the least it is a good shampoo and smells good</li>
    <li> I bought shampoo and conditioner and obsoletely satisfied with the products. From the first week my hair bush easier and a week later I noted loosing hair less. I received my products on time. Very happy. Thank you.</li>
    <li> a little dry without conditioner</li>
    <li> It is very concentrated and does not leave your hair itchy not greasy. So far so good. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Using my first bottle - like it</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo. After the first use my hair was softer, fuller and just healthier.  I have some spots in the front that were thinning out and it is much less noticeable. I won&#x27;t go a day without using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about two months before reviewing. While being deployed with tons of stress, this has stopped hair loss for sure. Hair seems to be thicker and grows slightly faster. A smell other than lavender would be nice, or one made for men.</li>
    <li> I used it every day and I felt  that I was even loosing more my hair. Even with the offer of a free bottle in return for my review, I didn&#x27;t want to keep using it and didn&#x27;t even ask for it.</li>
    <li> Excellent, just excellent.</li>
    <li> Bought for husband who decided his hair is falling out. This is his second bottle and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. Appearance of my hair seems to continue getting better after each wash. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It a woth to buy and it is nutraul cause it doesnt have chemicals and also it is a big bottle</li>
    <li> This shampoo has done miracles for my hair!! My hair looks a million times thicker and fuller (&amp; don&#x27;t get me started on the volume). Best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a few months and I am not impressed with results. Seems to be a waste of money, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! It lasts forever and is gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works great for cleaning and smells great to. Very thick lathering shampoo. Can&#x27;t talk to prevention of hair loss since I have only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely bulls***. Using it for 5 months and loosing hair even more. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than four months. I washed my hair every other day and it still hasn&#x27;t been used up. It is very useful to prevent hair loss! I like this product!</li>
    <li> Just the classic lie about hair .... It claims to make wonders but  seriously ... Just left me with more thinin hair and fallin ones .. I used 4 times and i think i start to notice more hair on my hands while showering ....</li>
    <li> This shampoo does what it says. My hair loss has slowed significantly. I used it regularly with no conditioner for about 2 weeks. After that, I alternated it and my regular shampoo/conditioner. It has a pleasant smell, and thoroughly cleans the scalp. I highly recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My husband has been using it for a month now and we noticed a difference already.</li>
    <li> First time purchaser and have been using it for about 3 weeks. Still to early to say it is having a huge impact, but I have seen some positive results: 1) notice less hair falling out while washing hair and 2) scalp feels less dry and healthy overall. Will continue to use for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for around 2 months now. The feeling it leaves my hair with is different from most regular shampoos. It feels kind of dry but I don&#x27;t mind it at all. As for its real purpose, I noticed that hair continues to fall. I think the rate at which it falls slowed down but it&#x27;s difficult to be sure.</li>
    <li> I used it for more than one month. Now my hair has stopped to drop. My wife also start to use it. We all like this produxt.</li>
    <li> In the short amount of time I have been using this product (about a month) my hair has grown more than it has in a year. I&#x27;m honestly astonished. It also doesn&#x27;t strip the color out of my hair which is a hugeee bonus. I have used everything imaginable including biotin, prenatal vitamins and even some weird hair mask that required me to stand upside down for 4 hours in hopes my hair would grow even a little. This shampoo has definitely sped up my hair growing process.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great, my hunsband likes the smell, and it does work</li>
    <li> After having major surgery in July 2014 and suffering from hair loss due to the anesthesia, I decided to look for a shampoo that might combat the hair loss as well help with regrowth. I&#x27;ve been using this product since the end of Sept. 2014 so it&#x27;s been a little over a month. I will say it definitely helped with hair loss because I found less hairs after brushing or after washing my hair. As for new growth, I think I still need more time to see if there is any change. I really like this shampoo because it makes my hair feel really squeaky clean as opposed to the regular shampoo I used to use. I will continue to use this product and give another review if I see changes in my hair volume.</li>
    <li> it make my hair dry but i think it can really help save my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a major problem with hairloss but I seem to have to switch hair products all the time otherwise my hair starts falling and scalp gets irritated. Tried this organic shampoo and its smooth, doesn&#x27;t seem to be harsh as other products and leaves me feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> I have just ordered my 3rd bottle of the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention.  It works excellent.  When I first started using it I noticed less hair in the sink and my hair just felt thicker.  To further enforce the product I had run out and had not ordered another bottle in about 45 days and I noticed my hair on my comb and in the sink again.  This may not cure baldness or hair loss, but it definitely slows the process way down.</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. looks and feels thicker also.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. This shampoo seems to be working for me</li>
    <li> It is really useful! it&#x27;s expensive but it seems to be working. The quality of water in my house is very bad which causes my hair loss. This shampoo calms down my hair loss and it&#x27;s made mostly of natural ingredients. I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Have had long time trouble with thinning hair. I started using the shampoo 1 month ago. There is no evident sign of hair growth, but do notice less hair loss. I like the texture of my hair after use. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Heard about this brand from my friends. After using it for 3 days, my colleagues told me they felt my hair denser. LOL, don&#x27;t know if it is true or not. But personally, I like its scent. Hair feels more smooth than after using Mane &#x27;n Tail, another great anti hair loose brand. Hopefully, will see better result after using it for weeks.</li>
    <li> Works great. I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> I am not one to truly believe that a shampoo can dramatically stop hair loss, but this product has genuinely helped improve my head of hair. Enough so that even at a relatively high price, I am willing to purchase it again. I have also begun using a light/weightless conditioner which may be as much to blame as this shampoo, but regardless I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> First time user and love the results so far. My hair feels a little thicker, but the most noticeable difference for me after using the shampoo for over a week regularly is that less hair seems to be falling out with each wash. I will recommend this shampoo to anyone who is concerned about hair loss.</li>
    <li> The shampoo did help me with the hair fall. It definitely slowed it down.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping.  After using for over a month, my hair is not falling out as much and noticed fuller hair.  Do not get in eyes or will burn.  Will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> This product is great, my hair loss has lessened since using it.  I love the fact that there are no harsh chemicals and it&#x27;s completely organic, also it smells great.</li>
    <li> Its okay so far nothing drastic( using for about a week and a half), but i give it four stars for hope in its potential!</li>
    <li> Notice less hair loss when used. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see hair growth overall. Good product worth the 20$</li>
    <li> I started using this product due to numerous positive feedbacks. But I honestly do not see the dramatic differences in preventing hair lost. Maybe I need to give it more time</li>
    <li> Very drying for curly hair, would not buy or recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a treat it hair and after dying it my hair start falling out like crazy, I try this product and my hair start being more silky and manageable plus is so relaxing due to all this my hair recover and stop folling</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a year now and I would have to say it&#x27;s the best shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m 60 and have found this shampoo to leave my hair clean and healthy looking all the time and it really seems to have slow down my hair loss drastically.&lt;br /&gt;Recently my extremely finicky 14 yoa grandson started using it and he love it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.G. Ft. Worth</li>
    <li> My wife loves this shampoo.  And it helps with the hair breakages.  I think this is the only shampoo she is ever going to need.</li>
    <li> been using this particular organic shampoo for nearly two months, after being dissatisfied with my emu shampoo. the emu brand worked well for nearly a year, but then the &amp;#34;hair-thickening/loss-prevention process&amp;#34; began to sadly fail. after almost 8 weeks, pura d&#x27;or has improved my hair&#x27;s strength, and when it is washed am seeing fewer follicles in my hands. i will surely continue purchasing this brand/shampoo.</li>
    <li> Sadly, it stripped my hair far beyond a clarifying wash : (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair feel like straw.  It lathered so much that I fell doubtful that this is sulfate-free : (</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product multiple times and would recommend it to other customers.  Prior to ordering this shampoo I was not experiencing significant hair loss, but my hair seemed to be getting thinner and weaker.  After using the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo for several weeks my hair was noticeably healthier and thicker.  I also like how my hair was not &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; as it can be with other shampoos.  One thing to note, when you approach the end of the bottle I noticed some of the ingredients can separate, so I recommend shaking the bottle periodically during use.</li>
    <li> it works on my hair. less hair loss after using couple times.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo about three weeks ago. Too soon to say about the hair loss prevention, but I can say I like the way the shampoo leaves my hair. I can see why it has been #1 on Amazon for all this time.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I cycle through a few different shampoos that are for sensitive scalps (paraben, sls free, etc).  This is one of them.  I can&#x27;t say with a strong assertion that it prevents hair loss, but it&#x27;s gentle on the scalp and my hair comes out fine post wash.</li>
    <li> It is not works for me and my family</li>
    <li> I feel this product is extremely useful and effective for my hair loss problem. After using this product for 1 week, a lot of new hair grow out. When I see the sink, after I finish showering, there is no hair left in it. I strongly recommend this product to you.</li>
    <li> The smell was pleasant. I&#x27;m still losing hair fairly often, but it&#x27;s improved a bit in the last month. Overall, not a bad product, but I&#x27;ll know more after I&#x27;ve used it for an entire month.</li>
    <li> I guess time will tell how effective this shampoo is at reducing hair loss but so far I feel like it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ve noticed less hair in the sink since using the product, and at a minimum, it makes my hair feel and look fuller than before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and have had a decrease in shedding. I also really like that it is a safe product, without harsh chemicals like SLS and parabens. Be sure to let it sit for about two minutes, so it can penetrate your hair follicles. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> The bottle lasts a long time, and the shampoo smells great.  It hasn&#x27;t worked miracles on me, but I like to think it has slowed down the hair loss.  I hope giving a second bottle a go will either stop the hair loss or slow it down even further.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the product however the shampoo makes your hair feel dry.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. She loves using it.</li>
    <li> I just received my first shipment of this shampoo and am already loving it.  It smells wonderful and has a great texture.  Argan oil is one of my favs and I love how my hair is responding.  I&#x27;ve been losing a lot of hair due to PCOS and have finally found a daily shampoo I can use!</li>
    <li> works great. hair feels healthy and the thinning has reversed. good stuff.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product so far. Just started it so I will keep ya posted on hair loss prevention.</li>
    <li> great product,I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks and have definitely noticed less hair falling out,it&#x27;s little bit expensive but i think its worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love the way this product makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice shampoo--smells great and leaves my hair shiny and bouncy. My hair seems stronger but I still lose a lot of it in the shower and have a pretty big receding hairline. I&#x27;ve only been using the shampoo for a few weeks...I don&#x27;t think any shampoo is going to be a miracle cure for that though.</li>
    <li> Love this, feels soft and refreshing</li>
    <li> This is the third bottle we are purchasing. This is really good organic product which controls hair loss.</li>
    <li> I must admit that I am quite impressed. I initially bought this product because it was organic, and because after a full haircut, I was shocked to see that my hair grew very slowly at the front and while the rest of my head was full, the front had almost no hair. I was kinda desperate and did not have much hope at first. But now, I am thankful that I found Pura d&#x27;or! My hair is back to normal in just a couple of months!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s growing anything back but it certainly isn&#x27;t falling out like it used to. For that alone, it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;ve used Pura d&#x27;or for about 2-3 years now. I shower once a day. Always shampooing. It makes my hair and scalp feel healthier.</li>
    <li> For those who are not sure whether to use this product or the Aveda Invanti 3-Step system, my pros and cons are provided below.    Aveda Invanti 3-Step System - Very good smell, only need to use just a little bit of both the shampoo and conditioner and they lather pretty well using the palm of my hand without too much effort. The entire system does wonder for the look and feel of hair, makes hair look healthier, soft and shiny. I purchased the system (shampoo, conditioner and revitalizer), very expensive at $116 and the entire system lasted me about 3 months for the main purpose of preventing hair loss / enducing hair growth. I initially noticed less hair falling off but about 2 - 3 months after use (everyday showering), the amount of hair I lost was about the same, if not more, comparing to before I started using the system. That was when I decided to switch to Pura based on the reviews I see online.    Pura - Comparing to Invati, the conditioner has equally nice smell, this one more manmade smell than the Invanti as the Invanti has ginsense smell.  The shampoo however has a very strong chemical spell in my opinion.  I use about three pumps for the shampoo in order to get it to lather up.  The trick is to use my palm and massage it quickly without stopping.  I use about two pumps for the conditioner to have a decent smoothness.  However, I did notice that using 3 or more pumps of the conditioner makes my hair a lot nicer and softer.  I&#x27;ve been using the product since December 2, 2014 and have noticed less hair loss. My hair seems thicker and fuller. I haven&#x27;t really looked closely to see if I see any baby hair growing (according to most of the reviews) but I feel my tiny bald spot is somewhat covered now. My hair definitly has grown a lot longer so I take that the product is working as advertised. I shower in the morning and sometimes I wash off the shampoo and conditioner in less than the recommended amount of time needed for the product to work as intended. Willhave to try a bit harder to leave them on longer but I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s so far working better than Invanti. The price is much better as well. Will provide update by the time I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> I thought the conditioner was a combination conditioner and shampoo.  I love the way the conditioner works and would love to try the shampoo!</li>
    <li> Truly amazing product! After repeated use, I have seen significant growth of hair on my scalp. In addition to growth, my hair is not as thin as it was before and it is stronger as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is experiencing hair loss/ hair thinning.</li>
    <li> Second bottle and works great.  Haven&#x27;t needed conditioner with this.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful! It helps me! I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a regrow hair shampoo,-And I received just like a strong hair look.-</li>
    <li> I had changed shampoos several times recently because my hair had become finer and had no body or volume whatsoever. I was also noticing that I was losing more hair when I washed it. But none of the other products helped. Then I read some reviews of Pura d&#x27;or, and decided to try it. I&#x27;m so glad I did! After one shampoo, my hair had more volume. After two weeks, the excessive hair loss had stopped! My hair is much easier to style, and now it has volume and life to it. It also feels soft and squeaky clean. It&#x27;s too soon for me to notice new hair growth, but I fully expect that to happen, because everything else about this product has been wonderful. I know I&#x27;ll be using Pura d&#x27;or, and nothing else, for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have a thin hair and this shampoo really works for me. I love tha scent of it. My hair feels thicker. This makes my scalp and hair feel SOOO clean, and it leaves my hair feeling just-right, with no over-drying. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the shampoo now for about a week and a half. Probably a little premature to say, however the shampoo itself feels good, not like a &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;. It lathers nice and gives my hair a nice clean feeling. I work it into my scalp and sides where I feel I need the growth for about a minute, then rinse. It definitely gives my hair body and expands the cuticle so it appears a little thicker. Ultimately (obviously) I would like this to regrow some hair in the &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; spot on the back of my head and hopefully thicken the sides above the ears. It states you must use it for 3 months to see true results. I&#x27;m optimistic and will continue to use it.. Not bad so far.</li>
    <li> It works. After 2 weeks use, it prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> After using it for a month, kinda feel like I have more hair?</li>
    <li> this is second time I order this. it is awesome! after I used for two weeks, I can feel my hair is getting stronger and more smoothy, the feeling was great. my hair has so dry, but now it is different!</li>
    <li> Tried it today for the first time. Feels amazing on my scalp. I think I found my favorite shampoo. Keeping my fingers crossed to see hair loss prevention results. Thanks for the amazing product</li>
    <li> I just ordered my third bottle of this shampoo. It really works. I am a 29 year-old male. Earlier this year, I noticed I lost a lot of my hair everyday, even by just scratching my head. I wanted to stop losing more hair. I did tons of research online and I looked at other people&#x27;s review. Finally, I am glad that I gave the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo a try. After using it every day for 3 weeks, my wife noticed that my hair is getting thicker and darker ( I have black hair). I like the smell because it does not smell like chemical and I can smell fresh herbs in it. Anyway, I recommend this product to anyone who is having hair loss problems. You will not regret to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I brought one and start to use it. Since I only used a few times,  so there is no obvious function of preventing hair loss. The smell is just ok, not as good as its condition, which smell like coconut. Currently I use these two for my hair. Hope it helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo now for over a week. I got this shampoo primarily to prevent hair loss. One of the first things I notice when I go the shampoo was the smell. I did not expect much but I really liked the herbal smell of the shampoo. It wasn&#x27;t overwhelming was surprisingly pleasant. As for the shampoo itself it is a great shampoo. And for twenty dollars it better be. After just a few days of use my heart was noticeably smoother, less oily, and softer. As for the hair loss aspect I don&#x27;t think I have been using the shampoo long enough to notice any significant difference. But I do think the volume of my hair has increased. Also my hair is noticeably less oily so I do think that would be helpful in preventing hair loss. This is an expensive shampoo, no doubt about it. But I do think if you want a high quality shampoo with &amp;#34;hopefully&amp;#34; substantial hair loss prevention I think the price is worth it. I hope I can check in in a few months to write about changes to my hair growth and hair loss.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it reduces the hair fall but one thing is sure that you don&#x27;t need a conditioner after using this, and it leaves your hair silky smooth</li>
    <li> Feel like it help  strengthening my hair root. Have not seen any new hair growth yet.</li>
    <li> I just purchase my second battle of this product, i just love it ! My hair has improved 80%, is so much fuller and healthier than before, also my hair is thicker than before i just love this product.</li>
    <li> I have just been using it for a week, and everytime I see the tub after  I brushing my hair, I always find fewer and fewer hair loss. Also no conditioner needed. My hair is naturally smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Great product and very pleased so far. It smells good too!</li>
    <li> Have used for two months. Not sure I can or should see a difference with hair loss at this point. I like the overall feeling of my hair after using is clean and soft with no residue. The scent is a bit medicinal but it is light. Not too different from what I would expect from an organic product. Overall I am pleased with the purchase and hope to see improvements on hair loss over a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks now and so far I love it. I can see a difference in my hair already. I plan on sticking with it for 3-6 months in hopes that I see a big difference in the thickness of my hair. So far I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo, it is very gentle. After a couple of weeks I noticed my hair getting thicker. I cannot say for sure if it helped me grow new hair, but it did thicken up my existing hair and I think with it being a gentle shampoo it will not cause more hair loss but would provide a good environment for new hair growth. I would recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boy friend. He has been using it for 2 months already. He said it actually work pretty well. The excessive hair loss had stopped, his hair has more volume now. It definitely worth to buy, and we will continue using this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I would like my husband try if works I will buy more later.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels after using this shampoo.  As I have hair loss, I am very careful on what I use on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The first use I notice NO LOSS of hair as I am shampooing. I have used other so call &amp;#34;great for hair loss&amp;#34; shampoo and could count the strands of hair in my hand. Second, I notices how really clean my hair got and no dry,course hair after rinsing. The Argan Oil is what makes your hair soft and contains the moisture. This is important to me as I don&#x27;t use conditioner every time. Finally, I notice the volume I have that I never had with any other shampoo.  I have finally found the shampoo of my dreams.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not contain chemical ingredients but organic ingredient instead, which is very healthy for my hair. I really like the smell of this shampoo. It smells like tea tree with other herbaceous plants. I feel my hair is very clean and not too dry after using it. Also, it does work for preventing loss hair. Overall it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> this product is great i use it daily and it really makes my hair perfect</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo, love it!</li>
    <li> I wrote a review for shampoo /conditioner under one. I am not sure if we are better off buying online because I really cannot believe that this product is authentically organic. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t thoroughly clean hair, it tangled mine, the conditioner was watered down and thin, did not condition or nourish. My hair was left a tangled frizzy mess. No thank you.</li>
    <li> Great value for this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I am in my mid twenties and have had a problem with hair loss since my late teens. I have tried everything pills, lotions, oils, and even spent 80 dollars on a shampoo regimen; nothing seemed to work. It has only been a week and I have already seen a drastic reduction in hair loss and feels a little more thicker. I will definitely be purchasing another one of these shampoos and adding the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for two months now and I have to say I really like what it&#x27;s done for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it, I feel like I&#x27;ve used conditioner already, even though I haven&#x27;t. Most other name-brand shampoos tend to leave your hair dry and squeaky after shampooing so you have to condition afterwards. I of course do anyway with Pura, but I feel like I don&#x27;t have to, so it&#x27;s a good clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed less hair in the shower afterwards, so that&#x27;s awesome as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The difference in my hair is unbelievable and I have only been using it for about 3 weeks now. I read all the reviews before I bought it and decided  to try it. I can happily said I have seen results since the first week. I let my son try and he liked it too, so I ordered him some too. I would suggest to anyone thinking about trying it to give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this item bc I loved it the first time! I had surgery this past year &amp; one of the side effects was hair loss so I&#x27;ve been trying different products but def love this one it works great over time. Like most products it doesn&#x27;t work over night &amp; the price was reasonable</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years and like it very much.  I have actually noticed less hair loss after shampooing and though I am  using other things as well, I think the shampoo is playing a good part.  It is an easy shampoo to use, lathers well, and really is the only one I use and am interested in using, which is why I buy lots when it is on sale.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift to my mom. She told me it&#x27;s helpful to prevent hair loss and she likes its scent! Good product!</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo! Was a little skeptical, but the many positive reviews prompted me to buy a bottle. It&#x27;s not a magic shampoo to regrow hair overnight, but, after 3 weeks of daily use, my hair loss has slowed almost to a halt. The hair is stronger, more manageable, much healthier looking. I will continue using</li>
    <li> Great shampoo super gentle on my hair. I noticed it stops falling hair, now my hair feels strong and looks healthy</li>
    <li> My mother is suffering from hair loss right now, so I got her a bottle of Pura d&#x27;or shampoo to see if it works for her. I like the smell. I bought another brand of shampoo from Whole Foods years ago to treat hair loss. It worked for me, but this time I want to try something new so I bought this. Pure d&#x27;or smells just like the one I bought from Whole Foods. Hopefully it works for my mother.</li>
    <li> I am not noticing any difference in the volume of my hair or increase in growth and I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 five weeks now.  A little disappointed.</li>
    <li> Early days, but the shampoo appears to give a bit of life and shine to my suddenly frizzy menopausal hair.  That alone is good to see.  I think it will take a bit of time to really know if it helps with hair loss, but I like the effect sufficiently that I am willing to ride this one out.</li>
    <li> I used this Shampoo almost two month. It&#x27;s pretty good.. I think it may help to prevent hair loss .&lt;br /&gt;I used  three times a week, it smells much of  ginger which is good for hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure it could perfectly prevent hair loss , may need time to see.</li>
    <li> I am a 38 year old man and continuing the hair loss process.  I use minoxidil and was looking for a shampoo to use daily that would strengthen my hair and make it look full.  Along with taking a daily dose of biotin, I have successfully slowed down my hair loss over the last year and a half. This shampoo smells great, lathers heavy with just one pump and rinses clean. And I don&#x27;t feel the need to use conditioner after this product.  I would recommend Pura d&#x27;Or as a great daily shampoo for men using minoxidil.</li>
    <li> It smells and feels very good. My hair looks better than before. I am still waiting for the big difference.</li>
    <li> Although I have not used this shampoo for long and cannot say at this point if it is stopping the hair fall, but I have noticed a slight difference. It is probably too soon to tell what it will do in the long run. I have tried a ton of natural shampoos and done a lot of research into hair loss as mine has thinned quite drastically in the past few years. This is the only one that I have found with the proper ingredients in it and it has none of the garbage that is in most commercial shampoos. I love how it makes my hair feel and will keep this one as my go to shampoo for hair loss. I deducted one star because of the price .. a bit expensive but you dont have to use a lot of it either. Great product!</li>
    <li> The first bottle purchase was a hesistant buy. After going through a bottle, getting a 2nd one was a no brainer. It smells and feels great and also leaves hair feeling stronger and smoother.</li>
    <li> Overall is good but a little too dry for my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fast and well wrapped, which is really good. The bottle is not large which makes this product seams a little bit expensive. I haven&#x27;t really used this and I&#x27;m not losing my hair heavily. But I&#x27;m planning to use this shampoo as long as I finished my current shampoo and see if this really helps prevent losing hair. Generally the shopping is satisfactory.</li>
    <li> It looks good for me, I use it more than 2 weeks. It start to stop the hair loass, Also have the new hair grow up.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> I Started using pura d hair loss shampoo a month back and i i see lot of improvement on my hair loss.I will strongly recommend this since it is organic and has argon oil in it.</li>
    <li> i bought 2 bottles shampoos, one for my sister and save one for myself. both of us like it. thinking to buy condition tooooo.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend to friends</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and definitely cleans my hair thoroughly. I wear gel on a day to day basis and i also train with head gear on. this product is like no other. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I have used this for about one month. So far so good. I also take biotin as the same time. My hair loss is very bad after my baby was born. And a friend recommend this to me. One thing is  that my hair is quite dry after using, so conditioner is essential. Hopefully, this can help me stop my hair loss.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery. Can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
    <li> I was suffering about the hair loss problem,  especially when my hair grows longer,  the situation is even worse. I go to swim at gym regularly, so I really need something that can save my hair,  then I found pura dor on amazon,  I saw so many nice comments there, so I decided to give it a try.  After using it for a while,  I believe it really helps preventing the hair loss, as I noticed less hair left in the shower drain screen even after the first shampoo. I honestly don&#x27;t know how it does the job, but it does. It is better to use a conditioner after it, I am using another natural brand conditioner with this shampoo, and I do believe my hair is getting better : )</li>
    <li> Great product, makes your hair feel great afterwards and doesn&#x27;t think it out at all. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is working well for me. And I can feel my hair become better than before</li>
    <li> Been trying different shampoos for a chronic sensitive scalp and itch for years. I have been alternating this with selsen blue aloe as well as soaking my scalp in a home made sea salt solution everyday.  Pura d&#x27;or seems to be quality made and does what it says which is very rare this day.  worth the extra $$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Selsun-Blue-Medicated-Dandruff-Moisturizing/dp/B001TSNM34/ref&#x3D;sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1343320776&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2-fkmr1&amp;keywords&#x3D;selsen+blue+alo</li>
    <li> Almost a week now since I start using this product and I can already see hair growth and less hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo for a few days now and have noticed my hair feeling fuller and less frail.  The shampoo smells great and seems like it would last a long time since I don&#x27;t use much when applied.  I have also noticed less hair falling out when I apply Minoxidil twice daily.  Usually I see a number of small hair on my hand after I apply Minoxidil.  So far so good.  I will post a updated review in a few weeks once I have used it longer</li>
    <li> Used for about 3 months. Great shampoo - still unsure of the hair loss prevention qualities, but my hair looks great. Used in combination with the Pura D Or conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought it few weeks back with the conditioner and have been using consistently. It has definitely made my hair smoother and silkier, but I have yet to certain of prevention of hair loss. Since using this product my hair have definitely started looking fuller and give a shiny healthier look.</li>
    <li> I have been losing tons of hair since using this product. As a result I have spent more time and money than I would like to admit thinking it was a thyroid or hormonal issue and it is this shampoo. I have lost 1/3 of my hair thickness in the 3 months of using it. It could work for some, but it destroyed my lovely hair. I wish I would never have used it.</li>
    <li> It was amazing! works really well and fairly quick. Noticed my hair getting a lot thicker and healthier.</li>
    <li> I bought it a few months ago. It has a good smell and done organically. Good Shampoo.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I have ever used. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Making my hair fall out. Im seeking a refund,</li>
    <li> Love this product and smells delightful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 8 months now and my hair is just getting worse. Can&#x27;t say it has worked. Not that I expected it to magically fix the thinning problem but I was hoping it would help any and it has not.</li>
    <li> I am over 40 with thinning and bleached hair. I purchased this because of all the great reviews. It made my hair so dry, brittle and frizzy. I even lost more hair using it. i also purchased the conditioner to go along with it. Needs less to say, my hunt continues for a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> product is what is says hair is stronger</li>
    <li> Purchased this product based on the reviews I saw online for my husband that has been complaining some time now of hair loss on his head and after only about 2/3 weeks we were able to notice a major difference ! At first he didn&#x27;t really believe it would work but now he uses this shampoo everyday and we really are impressed on the results. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone experiencing hair loss problems !</li>
    <li> Used almost one bottle.  I couldn&#x27;t tolerate it because if you don&#x27;t wash it off thoroughly, it will cause irritation and it woke me up because I was scratching my hair during my sleep.  If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, try something else guys.  Smells bad too.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to review long term results. My initial experience is that it lathers extremely well, smells nice and is supposed to have no harmful chemicals. It&#x27;s also quite expensive....The downside, is that because it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals to expand my hair shaft, it doesn&#x27;t add body. Still limp and flat. However if it&#x27;s good for my hair, it will be worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> good product, i will buy it again!</li>
    <li> so far after the 1st use, my hair is very soft. I will update later how it prevents hair loss or not later. I recommend this to my mom and she loves it also</li>
    <li> I really liked that this shampoo keeps my hair nice and shiny.  It definitely feels very soft after using it I could really tell a difference compare to other shampoos I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I will update after using the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> After using it for couple of weeks i have seen results of containing less hair loss but i haven&#x27;t seen any extra hair growth. maybe I have to keep using it for longer period time to see extra hair growth but so far i am liking the product. I think this product retains the hair but does not possess more hair growth.</li>
    <li> I love the tingle on my scalp as soon as I start to work it in and unlike other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos, this one really moisturizes. I am so happy I got this and I find myself looking forward to washing my hair!</li>
    <li> It smells good and makes my hair feel good. This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.I feel like I&#x27;m feeding my scalp &amp; hair with good nutrition when I use it.After about a week of using the shampoo, I noticed significantly less hair in my brush/in the drain. My hair is shiny, full of body, and from what I can tell, it&#x27;s beginning to fill back in again.Unlike some of the other shampoos I had tried in the past, it has a great citrus smell (at least to me) and it leaves my hair looking and feeling healthy. I can&#x27; wait until I&#x27;m 6-7 months in, when the shampoo shows its true potential!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost 3 months now and I have to say I like it a lot. Even though I haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth yet, I do notice less hair falling out when i wash my hair. My hair now looks and feels fuller than it did before. Highly recommended for those who wants fuller volume hair.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  I felt as though I was shedding more hair than usual so I started to use this shampoo.  Now when I wash my hair, I see 2 or 3 hairs on my hands as opposed to 10.  The scent of the shampoo is very fresh and not overbearing.  This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used where I don&#x27;t even need to use a conditioner because the shampoo alone leaves my hair extremely soft and manageable.  A little bit goes a long way.. while the shampoo isn&#x27;t the cheapest, it should last us guys at least 2 months(or more).</li>
    <li> Shipping is very fast. And it is effective in hair lost prevention. I bought it for my mom. She have been using it for a month and she think it is effective too.</li>
    <li> I loved their products. I washed my hair everyday and I could tell that it does not damage my hair like other brand.&lt;br /&gt;My hair seems to be improving since I started using this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this product and update my posted after few months..</li>
    <li> great smell, it works on my hair! I can see my hair loss was reduced.</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells good. Used for several weeks now, so far so good. It do help stop my hair loss.</li>
    <li> Fresh scent. You can feel the deep cleaning properties of the product from the get go. Hair is left clean while avoiding the use of chemicals.</li>
    <li> although this product washes my hair well, it doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any more volume. I just started using it, so time will tell if  it provides loss prevention</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals or parabens. My hair is thinning so I try to take best care of it as I can, and this does the job perfectly. Plus, it has a great mix of nutrients and natural DHT blockers to enhance growth and whatnot. No complains whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about three weeks ago. Upon first using it, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. Then, during the second week of use, I began noticing a marked improvement. Not only in terms of hair loss prevention but in bona fide hair growth. Count me as one happy customer who has found his shampoo of choice!</li>
    <li> Recommend it! Smell is good. And it really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one month. It seems help to prevent hair loss, I found less hair when I take shower. Will buy more and update the status.</li>
    <li> Been Using it over a month now but no result what so ever.</li>
    <li> A pretty good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping for organic products for my hair. This shampoo makes my hair feel softer and it smells good. The only one thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle. I need to pump a few times to get the liquid out. Otherwise, I would give it a 5-star</li>
    <li> I have tired many different products to treat my hair loss.  My most important concern should be if there are any chemicals in my hair care products that could be causing hair loss or preventing healthy growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By using  Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, Brown and Blue, I have found that healthier hair growth becomes possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 100% natural shampoo and nature’s potent ingredients that revitalize my scalp and hair follicles with rich natural safe nutrients for the best hair growth environment possible with great fresh looking hair.</li>
    <li> Used in conjunction with the pura d&#x27; or conditioner leaves your hair feeling like you&#x27;ve had a spa treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 9 months and have really noticed a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have oily hair. It leave my hair a great shape not sticks to my head as before.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for provide such good product.</li>
    <li> bought two bottles of the shampoo a month ago. Has been using it since. It looks that my hairs are darker and stop dropping even though I don&#x27;t see signs of new hairs growing.</li>
    <li> it looks like working for my husband</li>
    <li> Great product-&lt;br /&gt;Really appreciate the companies dedication to using all natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle shows that there are no harsh chemicals used.&lt;br /&gt;NO SODIUM LAURTHL SULFATE- (which most shampoos use)&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;It smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Gives hair great texture.&lt;br /&gt;Does what you want it to do-&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this shampoo and I am already noticing a huge difference in my hair. I have used different shampoos that are labeled organic and sulfate free but my hair kept falling out no matter what brand I used. This shampoo is the first one that has not caused my hair to be weighed down and fall out in clumps.  I can’t wait to see if my hair thickens back up after using this long term. I also noticed that my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch with using this shampoo as well. I am glad that I found it.</li>
    <li> This is the third bottle that I have been using to help me keep my hair. I&#x27;m over 60 and family and friends continue to give me compliments on my youthful looks. I think that this product is helping me to continue maintaining a healthful and full scalp. Since I been using it, I noticed less hair in the tub shower and sink.</li>
    <li> Shampoo works against hairloss but it leaves the skin dry quite a bit. I don&#x27;t mind since my skin is somewhat oily. But overall, I would recommend this product to others. But it won&#x27;t show until a couple of months of using it and with a dietary regimen. It lathers nicely as well.</li>
    <li> my hair loss reduced efficiently</li>
    <li> I still need to keep use it. But After using product, I got lots of dandruff though. So I had to use it with hand and shoulder at the same time.</li>
    <li> Definitely seeing less hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo that keeps my hair feeling clean and well hydrated.  It does minimize shedding, but does not eliminate it entirely.  I rotate nizoral dandruff shampoo into my regiment once per week and have experienced great results.  Overall this is a high quality shampoo that cleans my hair, I am not sure how effective it is as a DHT blocker</li>
    <li> I cut my hair to short, do you believe it will works for me?</li>
    <li> only been a few days, but the shampoo feels like it&#x27;s living up to it&#x27;s claims.  very fair price and def worth trying.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great! I&#x27;m half way through the bottle and my hair loss has stopped. My boyfriend noticed new hair growth on top of my forehead. He now wants a bottle for himself. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Shampoo is good to fight against hair loss.This product makes some very bold claims: Continued use WILL prevent further hair loss &amp; Safe for ALL hair types!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already used up one bottle. It works very well. I can tell that hair loss is less compared with before. And it only took one day to ship it to me. Last, the bottle is cute.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo, I&#x27;ve tried many products but this one is by far working fast! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> very good it works well</li>
    <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t seem to improve hair loss</li>
    <li> I start using this shampoo and after a week I saw incrediable results.My hair become so shiny and the strength of the hair is like it never was before.Honestly I&#x27;m very satisfy</li>
    <li> Just began using it and waiting to see results.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order the product at first since the price seem quite high compared to the amount of product per bottle. However, I am happy with the product now that I began using it since I feel like just a little shampoo goes a long way.</li>
    <li> When I first moved to a new house, we had hard water and my hair started shedding like crazy. 19 years old girl losing so much hair, I thought I was going bald and I was depressed for a while. I tried different store brand shampoos, some even made it worse. Then I found this on Amazon and I gave it a shot. It saved my life. I stopped losing so much hair. Of course my hair still falls everyday, but within a healthy limit.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, but you get used to it after a while. I tried the more premium gold bottle that costs more but didn&#x27;t like it as much. I thought the other kind made my hair sticky and gross, so I went back to this. Only shampoo I&#x27;ll ever use :D</li>
    <li> I took a chance and tried this shampoo about 9 mos ago. I had issues with my hair becoming very thin and falling out. I have to say this is by far the best shampoo I have ever used. The difference it has made in my hair is absolutely amazing. I can used it every day with no drying. My hair is so much thicker even my hairdresser wanted to know what I was using. I definitely would not used anything else. This is the best!!</li>
    <li> The best shampoo i ever used so far, i also recommend  it to my friend too</li>
    <li> It works well. I have noticed less hair falling out.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo after tried several other brands, finally find one thing could save my hair. I used to lose hair after each shower, I am so afraid to lose all my hair until I finally find this saver!! The effect begins to reveal at the first bottle, obvious less hair went off after washing my hair. I will definitely continue use this one.</li>
    <li> Does not work for me, leaves my hair very dry and frizzy even after conditioning.</li>
    <li> Smells great and my hair feels really soft!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few weeks now, at first I did not want to write a review because my hair felt and looked better within the first couple of days.  Now I know for sure that this is better then what I have used for last 20 years, and that was supposed to be top of the line.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why I gave this a try, I&#x27;m sure glad I did though and it is by far best I have used.</li>
    <li> it adds volume and keeps the scalp moist</li>
    <li> I remember the first time I purchased this product. I even liked the smell of it and it did help with my dandruff problem and even hair loss. Then after I finished that first bottle, I decided to order another one. So I did, but this time (the same product) didn&#x27;t seem to have the same smell and it seems to be giving me more dandruff than I had before. I don&#x27;t know if the decided to change their formula or what... I just know that it&#x27;s not working like it used to. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t reduce my hair loss.</li>
    <li> It incredible how you can feel the difference from day one, your hair actually feel thicker and easy to comb. Great instructions in the product label that actually help you understand what the product does. One thing I loved was its compromise with the animal tasting. Indeed it is a great product for a reasonable price. At least other products of the same level are twice much as this product with half of quantity others have.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a couple weeks now...definitively noticed a difference in my scalp and thickness of my hair. Plus, it smells great.</li>
    <li> it smells good, and hope it will lessen my hair loss</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, smell good!</li>
    <li> After I used this product for a month, I felt it helped me to prevent the hair loss. It helped my hair to grow stronger than before.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I have noticed some improvement in my hair loss and I like the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo! Helps with my hair loss. Gentle on hair. Organic. Great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to leave reviews for any product. However, I began suffering from major hair loss 2 years ago and tried everything from pills to oils to try and help me. I changed over to this shampoo and although it took about 3 months to see results I have seen amazing improvement in my hair. I no longer have chunks of hair coming off in the shower and I don&#x27;t have to worry about brushing and leaving a trail of hair everywhere. Of course I don&#x27;t consider this a miracle in a bottle, I think good nutrition is also important, but I have not and will not go back to any other product. Give it time, but at least for me this did the job.</li>
    <li> I have always had soft thin hair. Over the past couple of months I have noticed my thin hair getting even thinner. After washing my hair it would be &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; and could never look how I wanted it to look. I would often times shower and skip out on the shampoo so my hair would lay better but it would look greasy after a couple days. This shampoo seemed to make my hair heavier, less fluffy, lay better, and feel fuller when I ran my fingers through it. It was a weird feeling the first couple washes but I love it now. The smell is neutral, not really a good smell but not bad either. I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth yet (I&#x27;ve used it daily for 3 weeks now) but I have noticed it hasn&#x27;t thinned anymore and I don&#x27;t shed all over my laptop anymore. Even if my hair doesn&#x27;t grow at all, I&#x27;d still recommend this shampoo to anyone with thin hair. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> Not every product is for every consumer.  This product made matter worse for me.  It&#x27;s best to consult a dermatologist specializing in scalp disorders or conducting thorough product research before trying new products like this.</li>
    <li> not bad product different smell but ok</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product and conditioner for about one week and as expected have not seen much results but can say it sure smells good and leaves my hair feeling softer with a somewhat fuller appearance, possibly due to a bit of thickening. Will continue use for now.</li>
    <li> I waited several weeks to write this review because with all hair loss reduction products it takes several weeks to see results.  Now after about 4-5 weeks of daily use - I&#x27;m pleased to say I have noticed a difference in the amount of hair lost and there does seem to be a moderate reduction on the number of hairs I pull out of the drain daily.  Nothing that supports signs of regrowth but the overall loss rate has decreased.  I will continue to use it for only this reason; otherwise it&#x27;s one of the worst shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used.  It lathers and spreads nicely but the smell is medicinal and leaves my scalp very itchy.  Also my hair is dry and frizzy and I use the corresponding conditioner daily.  Overall delivers on reduction of hair loss but is a harsh shampoo.</li>
    <li> I find it a bit drying, but other than that I really like it. I have noticed less hair coming out in the shower and less on my comb and brush so far. I plan on continuing to use it to see if it remains beneficial. I have thyroid issues that were throwing off my testosterone levels, so this has helped reduce hair loss. I didn&#x27;t think it would reduce hair loss issues from the thyroid medication but I do think it is helping with the testosterone (DHT) related hair loss. I&#x27;m very hopeful it continues to help prevent hair loss until they get my hormone levels back in balance. I can&#x27;t say if it works with hair regrowth yet but will post another review in a few months and update at that point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now, and I noticed that I&#x27;ve been loosing more hair than before! I even followed their instructions but with no result. According to the company \\&quot;Like many products, it may not work for everyone\\&quot; so I think I&#x27;m one of those people. I guess I should look for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;So the company contacted me about their shampoo explaining \\&quot;Like all products, it may not work for everyone.\\&quot; which I think it can be true. However, I would believe that they should have added this information on the product description. In my opinion if they did I would be satisfied. Also, they issued my a refund to compensate my dissatisfaction and gave me an extra money to purchase any competitive shampoo of my choosing. I think they have good customer service by doing such thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 24 year old woman and the long term damage I&#x27;ve done to my hair was showing every time I washed it. I was afraid to look at my hands after washing the shampoo out, there was always a clump of hair in my hand. I tried Wen, which took me forever to actually afford buying it more than once and to no avail I kept losing hair...maybe even more! I panicked and researched how to stop this.&lt;br /&gt; DHT (Dihydrotestosterone) blocks the pores in your scalp from absorbing any nutrients that something like Wen may give you. And anything that may cleanse your hair has sodium laurl sulfate (like bleach to hair), and almost all shampoos have this. So it&#x27;s a catch 22 when you have hair like mine. If you want a shampoo to slow or stop hair loss and give you back some hair this is the shampoo I would use.&lt;br /&gt; It has niacin in it, which stimulates circulation to the scalp and promotes re-growth. It&#x27;s cleans the pores to remove DHT buildup using salicylic acid, allowing all the other nutritious elements of this shampoo to actually penetrate, clean, and absorb into the scalp and hair. It contains tea tree oil to keep pores clear and nettle extract, saw palmetto, pygeum extract, pumpkin seed oil and green tea extract to keep out DHT buildup. Also, biotin, rosemary oil, vitamin E and B-vitamin complex, which are thought to benefit hair health. Lastly, it contains he shou wu (fo-ti), which is thought to benefit hair growth. It is also known to kill the fungus associated with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks or so and already I can tell that this will save my hair. Down to 2-5 strands a shower now, as appose to the uncountable strands in the clumps I was losing. I can&#x27; wait until I&#x27;m 6-7 months in, when the shampoo shows its true potential!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars because this is only the beginning....otherwise I would give it 5 off the bat.</li>
    <li> its been a month. i haven&#x27;t seen a progress yet. I am going to give a month lets see how it goes</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems pretty harsh and makes my hair matted in the shower</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for months now and I would say it has done wonders to my hair!  My hair loss has been mitigated, and my existing hair has become fuller and more resistant to breakage.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to control their hair loss or wants a fuller, stronger head of hair.  It also contains all-natural ingredients and is gentle for daily use.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of the shampoo but it did nothing for hair loss. I would not re-purchase this product.</li>
    <li> It helps prevent and reduce hair loss</li>
    <li> Found it good natural shampoo for everyday use without any harsh chemicals .</li>
    <li> I’m on my fifth bottle and love this stuff.  Though I have not regrown any hair with it, my hair line has ceased to further rescind since I started using it.  The shampoo has a very pleasant smell as well.</li>
    <li> I straighten, blow dry, and use a lot of product on my hair and have been noticing some hair falling out from me working it so hard. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably a normal amount (everyone losses at least 80-100 hairs a day) but as a preventative measure I picked up this shampoo as recommended from my hair stylist. I love it! I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair falling out since using it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for several months now and my wife says my hair loss has slowed. It also leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable. I will definitely continue to buy Pura d&#x27;or Organic Shampoo</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for almost 2 months and I can tell a huge difference in how his hair looks and feels. He tried a few other products when his hair started to get thinner but nothing really seemed to slow down the process until this. He still has a good amount of hair and isn&#x27;t bald by any means but there was no denying he was losing his hair and at the rate he was going he would be bald before 3 years. He&#x27;s been using this product for a few months and although he hasn&#x27;t shown signs of his hair returning to spots where it once was (forehead) the progression has stopped completely and his hair feels thicker. When he would get out of the shower you could clearly see his scalp shining through but now it&#x27;s not as bad and getting better. I&#x27;ll be staying on him about using this product because to put it in simple terms: it works!</li>
    <li> Like any other products similar i believe its one of the best out there I don&#x27;t know why everybody doesn&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> Like it so far. I&#x27;m gladly giving up a fancy bottle and label for a good product. The contents are what&#x27;s important anyway, right? The list of ingredients sold me on trying it. The results give me the confidence to keep using it and to repurchase.</li>
    <li> I just received my pura d&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner yesterday and already I can see a difference in the health of my hair.  The label says 3 months so I was prepared to wait and pleasantly surprised to see a difference in one shampoo and condition!  The smell of the conditioner is lovely.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what 3 months will do!</li>
    <li> I have a phobia of losing my hair at any age, so I like to take preventative measures when I can. I bought this shampoo as a precaution to all the heat damage I&#x27;d been putting my hair through. I was a little concerned when I saw it contained DHT since I&#x27;ve had issues with breakage, but I can certainly say this is helping my hair. Since I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or, I haven&#x27;t even had to do a trim. My hair is growing and that is what is important to me. My hair also has much more volume than it used to have, so I can wear my hair in many different styles and not be worried if my hair looks flat.</li>
    <li> This was my second time purchasing this shampoo. I absolutely loved it the first time. It worked incredibly. I purchased it again and it was as if it were a completely different product. The shampoo had a sticky, slimy consistency. It was so stringy and reminded me of mucus. It was very difficult to put on my hair and was a nightmare to wash off. My hair did not even look washed after I used it. I don&#x27;t know if it was a bad batch I was sent or the company changed the product.</li>
    <li> This is some excellent shampoo. It does everything that it advertises to do, and as an added bonus, it is an organic product! I am always skeptical when dealing with products that make claims like this one does, but it really does add thickness to my hair and makes it feel soft as well. At this kind of a price, results like this are very hard to find. Would definitely recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Works well, since I&#x27;ve used it on my receding hairline, it looks to have strengthened my thinning hair.  I would recommend giving this a shot.  It is gentle enough for daily use, no harsh chemicals that other shampoos have.</li>
    <li> I have mostly thick, curly, unruly and easily tangled hair. I also have an autoimmune disease that requires a strong medicine, and (unfortunately) hair loss is one of the side effects of this medicine. However, I&#x27;ve been fortunate so far in that I have somewhat minor hair loss; it&#x27;s noticeable to me in my \\&quot;part\\&quot; areas, but not overly remarkable to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;d rather not lose *any* hair, I thought I&#x27;d give this shampoo a try. After 4 months of use, I can only say that it seems to work okay... I don&#x27;t have huge amounts of regrowth in the areas where I part my hair (my problem areas), but I do notice a slight difference. This result, as of 4 mos of use, is good in my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the results, though, is that my hair is soft, shiny, and much more controllable. I haven&#x27;t used conditioner in almost the entire time I&#x27;ve been using this product, and love not having to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, in my opinion, is the smell of the shampoo. While I don&#x27;t like strong perfume scent in ANYthing, I think this could smell a lot better than it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Comment Comment | Permalink</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a while now, has been a great natural shampoo that has helped prevent my hair loss, I combine it with Rogaine and both do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair clean, natural and shinny. I don&#x27;t even have the need to use conditioner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been so good, that my grandmother, who had scalp irritation, started using it when I told her I thought it could do her well... She hasn&#x27;t used any other shampoo ever since. I purchase her&#x27;s every time she need more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely keep using this product! Try it out! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a natural shampoo because I believe the other chemical ones were damaging my hair and it was falling out. My head was itchy because of all the chemicals in my previous shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using pura d&#x27;or hair loss shampoo for over a week now. I love it. My scalp isn&#x27;t itchy my color is still vibrant and I havent seen any additional hair loss. I will continue this product and with continued used I hope to see more improvement. It smells nice and lathers really well. Thank you guys. You may have just saved my hair ! Sarah</li>
    <li> In just a short amount of time my hair already looks fuller. I am very impressed! I will definitly buy more when I run out. I will also reccomend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for more than 2 yrs ,It&#x27;s great for my hair I used it everyday and even my wife used it.I recommend to a friend and she&#x27;s amazed how this shampoo do to her and she wants for her and her son who suffering early hair loss .I recommend to everyone this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I gave 5 stars because it feels good in my hair and on my scalp. My hair is thinker just after one use. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It has only been two weeks since I started using this product. My daughter, her 2 children and I use it every day after we are done swimming in the pool and using the spa. So far it makes our hair nice and soft and shines, but I&#x27;m not sure yet about the hair loss part. I am going to come back later and give another review after I&#x27;ve used most of the bottle. That&#x27;s why I only gave it four stars for now</li>
    <li> this product is very dope, it seems too be working super swell, my friends all love the product as well bro</li>
    <li> It made my hair so dry, and hair loss got much worse, it&#x27;s a lie i swear</li>
    <li> I have tried almost everything to make my hair stronger, and thicker.  I was getting bald spots and had no hair to comb over.  It didn&#x27;t take very many shampoos at all for this shampoo to make my hair thicker.  I have more hair now and no problems combing over bald spots.  I still struggle with thinning above my forehead a bit, but I think that is because I am afraid I will get soap in my eyes when I shampoo too close to my face..  I start my shower with shampooing with this shampoo.  I leave it on while I bathe, then rinse it out last.  I have very white cotton candy textured hair. My niece says my hair is like feathers.  But this shampoo gives me LOTS of cotton candy feathers instead of bald spots. If I have hair product build up, I shampoo once, rinse then shampoo and leave on for a while.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this  product for more than a year at least and this is the only shampoo I would use. I can&#x27;t say it actually regroup my hair because I didn&#x27;t take a before pic.but at least it doesn&#x27;t make my bold area as apparent as before. Losing hairs especially for a woman can be very dramatic and there is not much you can do because most likely it&#x27;s genetic. I know that because my sister had the same problem. I also take hair and skin supplement.</li>
    <li> Really nice product, great for hair loss prevention, see improvements after one month</li>
    <li> Yes. I was looking for many hair loss prevention shampoo&lt;br /&gt;And this stuff is finally what I&#x27;m looking for&lt;br /&gt;It is help for my hair thickness and hair volume.&lt;br /&gt;cause I decided for this good rating.</li>
    <li> My hair seems fuller and there were balding spots in the back that show less now since using this for a few weeks. The biggest thing I notice is a lot less hair clumps falling out in the shower than I used to see.</li>
    <li> Really pleasant shampoo, leaves hair shiny, full, and minimizes hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for 2 years and my hair has vastly improved!  I will admit that my problematic area is still thin, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be back to it fullness I had as a child.  That&#x27;s a bit presumptuous.  However, I recently saw a picture of myself before I started using this shampoo and could not believe how thin my hair was back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I am a bit of a cheapskate and was hesitant about spending nearly $40 on a bottle of shampoo, but as a man with shorter hair, one bottle lasts me a full year.  Plus, if you do some searching, you can find deals on it from time to time.  Just have to shop smartly.</li>
    <li> My hair has been gradually thinning for a couple of years and I have been using Nioxin as a preventative measure.  I decided to try something new based on all the positive feedback this product got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not losing too much hair to begin with, but after a few weeks of using this product EVERY time I run my hand through my hair strands fall out.  In fact, my hair has noticeably thinned out in just a few weeks going from \\&quot;kind of thin\\&quot; to \\&quot;noticeably thin\\&quot; in spots.  I&#x27;ve also gotten a few bumps on my scalp since using this product (they feel almost like sore pimples) and a couple instances of small scabs on my scalp.  Both of these symptoms are completely new and have never happened to me before I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have read the 1 star reviews sooner.  There&#x27;s a lot of my container left but I will not be using the product anymore.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this shampoo in conjunction with Avalon Organics Biotin B Complex Thickening Shampoo for about 8 months now and together they have worked wonders for her.  She isn&#x27;t losing half of the hair she used to lose and her hair is much longer now. I can&#x27;t honestly say if this shampoo is causing the difference or the combination of the two but either way we will continue to buy the two together in the future.  I researched a lot of shampoos before buying these two and I found out that the combination of Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention and Avalon Biotin B Complex shampoos together have almost all of the active ingredients of many of the other shampoos that people claim are working for them. Check the ingredients out of some of the &amp;#34;better working&amp;#34; shampoos and see if you see what I saw.  Hope this helps someone out :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been losing my hair for years and I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations when I ordered this product, but I read all the great reviews and decided it was worth a try.  Before using this shampoo I would have a hair brush full of hair that I lost within one week. The results from using this shampoo happened quickly. I noticed way less shedding and hair in the sink after about 3 uses. Now I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and my brush hardly has any hair in it! The one thing I noticed which I&#x27;ve never had happen in my life is a pimple I got on my scalp. I would assume it&#x27;s because this is kind of an oil maybe. Not sure, but I&#x27;ll deal with the little pimple if my hair stays on my head!</li>
    <li> The shampoo that I originally ordered was amazing; I loved it. I ordered a new bottle, and it came with completely different ingredients. The new formula is terrible (no lather, more chemicals,  polymers!-- I thought this was supposed to be organic). This shampoo doesn&#x27;t work, and I wasted a lot of money on some overpriced, poisonous detergent. DONT BUY... THE INGREDIENTS LISTED ARE NOT THE ONES IN THE PRODUCT THAT THEY SEND YOU!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this product when I ordered it but have been pleasantly surprised since I started using it! It hasn&#x27;t given me a full beard but I have noticed thicker hair as well as a few extra hairs filling in lately! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few days. Although, I can&#x27;t yet attest to its &amp;#34;preventing hair loss&amp;#34; capabilities, so far I&#x27;m happy with it solely based on the natural/organic ingredients. I&#x27;ve been using cheap hair products because my hair is healthy and unprocessed, but my hair dresser recently told me it looks like I have some thinning spots?!? I figured this has to be 1000 times better than cheap Walmart shampoo, even if it doesn&#x27;t make my hair grow back (which I&#x27;m hoping it will). I like the smell, but then again I like tee tree oil. If you don&#x27;t know what tee tree smells like you may be a little put off by the smell.  I&#x27;d buy again, it&#x27;s a little pricey - but you get what you pay for in terms of ingredients, etc.</li>
    <li> it adds volume and keeps the scalp moist! Great shampoo, love it</li>
    <li> I have thin, brittle hair and after washing, my hair was always even more dry and frizzy. This shampoo has greatly improved the moisture and made m hair more managable. I have only been using it for a short time so I have not had time to see any growth results, but fewer stands fall out. The shampoo does not lather like shampoos with sulfates, which is not a problem as I know it&#x27;s not damaging my hair. Sinc beginning use I have noticed les dandruf from the winter cold as. I  would recommend it based on results to date.</li>
    <li> Overall I should say I like this Shampoo. After 3 months of use, my hair loss seems getting improvement. While as other reviews point out, the dandruff problem is the major concern that I have for continuous use of this shampoo. Probably this shampoo is not good for oily hair (as mine).</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it really works used it for a wile saw no difference</li>
    <li> I think this shampoo really make you feel comfortable, just begin using ,hopefully it can make hair denser</li>
    <li> For an older guy with thinning hair I liked the way this shampoo worked better than any store bought stuff!  It won&#x27;t grow hair, but it is gentle on the scalp and makes my hair look fuller.  Plus I can use it every day without the scalp sores that I used to get from the harsher shampoos I have bought for years.  GOOD STUFF!</li>
    <li> At first, it didn&#x27;t work. But I waited for one month and it did work! I feel better right now. I hope I will continue to work.</li>
    <li> My hair seems like the product, since I started using it, I see less hair falling out, soft and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I really like what my hair feels like after using this shampoo. This product has a holistic feel to it, that is a plus, too!</li>
    <li> The person who wrote a review after using this product for 4 day shouldnt qualify as an accurate review. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a month and I have noticed a reduction in hair loss. After a month of using thw shampoo I noticed maxium hair growth and my hair stylist also complimented on my new growth. This is amazing product. It is pricey but u get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how amazing this shampoo is.  I do not usually write reviews but with this shampoo I had too.  I&#x27;ve been suffering with thinning hair due to menopause and thyroid meds however I am taking hair, skin, nails vitamins which is helping me and Nioxin shampoo/conditioner, which is also great.  However, the first time I used this shampoo WOW!  While I was blow drying it I couldn&#x27;t believe how good my hair felt and it just felt really good.  I&#x27;m not sure if I read somewhere that you don&#x27;t need conditioner with this shampoo but that is not true for me.  I definitely needed to use conditioner after shampooing.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so expensive but it&#x27;s a nice big bottle and should last long- I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day- every other day.  I recommend you give this a try.  Finally, something that seems to be working after only 2 uses.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair feeling clean and soft. Nice size bottle lasts a long time and it lathers nicely. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change with hair loss but there appeared to be a little less hair in my comb.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great product&#x27;after my husband using the product &#x27; he was satisfied with the results no more hair lose and his hair was fuller.</li>
    <li> Shampoo seems to do a decent job of cleaning, has a great lather, just apply and leave in for a few minutes before rinsing out.  Waited until the bottle was half used before leaving a review. Have noticed that less hair seems to fall out when styling, this shampoo probably isn&#x27;t a cure all for hair loss, but is a good tool containing DHT blockers to use in your regimen.  Plus, it seems to be made using natural ingredients and is pretty gentle over all, so why not use it?</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Background: Norwood 2 hair/mature hairline, no apparent MPB, 27 years old when I started using the product (have used for 12 months now).  I haven&#x27;t notice any excessive shedding since I started using it, and the general thickness of my hair is the same as prior (moderate thickness).  When I started using this product, I was not experiencing/noticing any hair loss, just wanted to be proactive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: the shampoo does use good quality products that have been implicated in the maintenance of healthy hair (e.g., see link below).  I like that they use a very mild dirt and oil surfactant (the one they use in Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo, it&#x27;s called cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine).  Some people claim that this too is a harsh chemical, but I don&#x27;t understand how you will separate dirt, oil, hair product, and general residue from your hair without some type of surfactant.  To me, this is magnitudes of order better than SLS or other sulphate surfactants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e.g. research study, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4017725/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Limitations:  I strongly believe this product does next to nothing for those who are in mid-stage hair loss.  Hair loss can be very hard to assess, happening very quickly for some, or slowly and awkwardly for others.  Use your discretion, but In my view, this product does not have the backbone to regrow hair or even save hair that has lost its youthful robustness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  If you want to wash your hair with a natural product, and be proactive about maintaining healthy hair, I think this product is good.  If you are losing your hair, my honest recommendation is to move to more aggressive treatments.  I can&#x27;t say how effective it is in long-term hair preservation, but the ingredients are supported in research as hair sustainers (though mostly orally, not much research into topical applications of Pura D&#x27;or ingredients yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s., used the lavender conditioner, but did not re-order.  I found it really dried out my hair.</li>
    <li> great product, which is pure nature. Hairs drop little after using about 1 week.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a shampoo for a long time that has no chemicals and that actually works.  I have had a hair loss problem along with thinning.  My hair also takes a long time to grow.  I have been using this for about a month now and the results were immediate.  I will always buy this in the future.  The smell reminds me of a dandruff shampoo (medicine) which I don&#x27;t mind, at least I know there aren&#x27;t any fragrances in it.  Would recommend to anyone with these similar problems :)</li>
    <li> It thickened my hair after the first wash.</li>
    <li> So far can see no difference</li>
    <li> Amazing this stuff ACTUALLY works. My husband and I both have noticed that our hair falls out way less and our shower drained is hardly clogged with hair the way it used to be. Also my hair is incredibly shiny now.</li>
    <li> Love the product, works great.</li>
    <li> I have only used the shampoo three times so far, so I can&#x27;t really say how it works for hair loss yet.  My hair does seem to feel a lot silkier and softer.  It does not lather as much as I like my shampoos to, but my hair feels very clean and soft.  It reminds me a little bit of a &amp;#34;tea tree&amp;#34; type of shampoo in the way it lathers.  I will continue using it and comment on hair loss after a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Nice Fragrance, conditions hair very well and gives hair a good texture after every wash. I am suffering from hair loss, I will continue this product for a month and then I will update review again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference other than it making my hair a tad thicker. I like that it&#x27;s organic and much better for your hair than over the counter shampoo.</li>
    <li> Used it for 6 months. I&#x27;ve not see any change or reduction in the speed of hairfall. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Over the last year I have used this product and can say that I truly believe it is working. A few years ago I noticed hair loss excelerating and hat has stopped since using this product.</li>
    <li> Even if this product didn&#x27;t stimulate hair regrowth, its still an excellent quality of shampoo, lacking all the chemicals that actually causes poor hair health.  But, it does indeed add the benefit of regrowing hair, as it nourishes and moisturizes the scalp thoroughly.  Scalp is basically skin, and when your skin becomes dry, thin and lacks vitamin E it is unhealthy, and this is where Pura d&#x27;or comes through with replenishing the scalp and even stimulates the hair follicle naturally so what you now have less fall out.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for 3 months, this is what I&#x27;ve experienced:  less fall out, more volume, healthier hair and scalp, and even a light peach fuzz of hair growing back in areas of recent fall out.  I look forward to updating this review in 6 months.</li>
    <li> i have been using Pura d&#x27;or shampoo for about a year.  i typically leave the shampoo in my hair for 10 minutes after shampooing, and then rinse in the shower.  the shampoo is thick and lathers well.  Pura d&#x27;or leaves the feeling that my hair is thicker and softer, with no drying effect.  i have noticed no dandruff using the product, and the bottle lasts a long time because not much is needed.&lt;br /&gt;  there is no comparison between regular store bought shampoo and this product.  to coin a much overused cliche; you get what you pay for.  the ingredients in the product are astounding, yet evidently work in concert with one another to give the hair a feeling of fullness and shine.  i have dark hair and the product seems to enhance my color.  i would recommend Pura d&#x27;or highly.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I started treatment again and could go bald, my scalp is very sore and itchy.  This shampoo is very soothing, it makes my scalp not itchy and sore. The sent smells like herbs; refreshing and natural. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> After 3 months of following the instructions I see no difference in my hair growth.  Its hard to say if it has prevented hair loss but I honestly have my doubts.  It is nice smelling and leaves my hair (whats left of it) feeling clean.  Its hardly worth the price based on the lack of effect on my situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 6 months still nothing but hairline acne.  No new hair nor reduced hair loss.  Waste of money.  Reviews should be ashamed of this BS comments.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a great Hair Loss Prevention shampoo for a long time that are totally natural.  Usually the natural ones produce no lather.  This one feels like a normal shampoo and makes my hair feel very texturized which is important for my fine hair that&#x27;s starting to thin.  I&#x27;m so glad that I found this and that people took the time to recommend it.  I recommend it whole heartedly.  This is my very first time recommending anything on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just got the bottle and like it so far will be reviewing it further once i have a month with it.</li>
    <li> I actually like it after a couple uses. At first it felt kind of weird and different from the other brands that I&#x27;ve used. However, my hair felt thick and healthy after a couple use and is easy to take care of. My hair used to be very curly and thin. Now I have thick and healthy hair. Great product, will buy again.</li>
    <li> After washing my hair, I like to blow dry it. And I noticed I shed a lot whenever I blow dry my hair. However, I did notice this product have helped reducing my hair loss while drying my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t say it helped a lot, but I noticed some difference. I&#x27;m curious to see the long term effect my hair on this product.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I wanna mention about this product is it gives me a little more dandruff than my Nexxus Luscious Volumizing Shampoo. I have pretty thin, soft and kinda oily type of hair. Maybe it has more moisturizing nutritions than other brands, which is a good thing!</li>
    <li> it has been 3 months, not working, my hair loss seems getting bad with this product, switched to regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention shampoo is every thing as stated.  I have seen considerable change in my hair.  Nothing near the hair loss I had experienced.  In-fact, so little is falling out that hair is filling in.  I just started my second bottle.  I would recommend to anyone whether or not you hair is falling out.</li>
    <li> Caused a skin rash on my forehead and balding skin. Took about 2 weeks to develop. Made my hair and scalp feel horrible.</li>
    <li> Washes hair well. Hair left feeling clean and smells ok. There&#x27;s tingling sensation when using it.  Update 1 year later:  this product eventually dried my scalp and got itchy.  I had to switch products.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo along with pura d or conditioner to help my hair from thinning so much.  So far it has helped a lot.  It lathers up well and doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.  It has helped bring back the luster that was once in my hair.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure why, this shampoo our conditioner did work for my hair AT ALL. My hair continued to fall. The shampoo made it dry for a couple of days even when I used the conditioner. And in a couple of days, hair would suddenly get oily and stringy. Anyway, didn&#x27;t make my hair feel healthy at all.</li>
    <li> Used it and it did not work. There is a fool born every second and that second was mine evidently.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft.</li>
    <li> It was all good after first bottle, see less hair lost. After second bottle, hair condition is going worse, more hair lost, I am going to stop using it now!</li>
    <li> The pump mechanism just wouldn&#x27;t release.  This a problem because I ended up wasting the product .  I have idea if it is defective or the design is just that difficult</li>
    <li> Seeing a difference since I have used it..highly recommend. !!!! I&#x27;m very glad I found this product. It&#x27;s a must get.</li>
    <li> This a great product which worked very well.</li>
    <li> I have dry, thin hair.  When using regular shampoo, there&#x27;s been always noticeable hair loss after each shower when I look at the bottom of the bath tub.  Ever since I started using this for almost a month now, I can hardly find any dropped hair on the tub after the shower.  This shampoo makes your hair feels rich and loose after shower, even without using any conditioner, unlike some other shampoo that makes hair sticky.  It has a mild, pleasant scent, just a few drops on your palm is enough.  I really enjoy using this product and would highly recommend anyone to give it a try.</li>
    <li> After having my son, I experienced heavy hair loss 3 months ago. I looked for a shampoo for preventing hair loss. I have been using this product since then, I am so happy that my hair loss is getting decreased. I will use one until I have a second child! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and fell in love with it myself. Adds great volume to my hair and I love that it is free of harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> So far its been working good. I also take Biotin supplement with it.</li>
    <li> I honestly was not expecting much after trying other hair loss prevention shampoos, but this one actually surprised me. I have to say that that there has definitely been less hair loss and my hair looks healthier as well. I will be purchasing more once this first bottle runs out. I have previously tried other, much more expensive brands that did nothing for me but drain my wallet. I also think the scent is really pleasant and not at all too heavy, nor does it smell as if I walked out of an herbal shop that stinks!</li>
    <li> The product is good but i have long hair but the amount of pumping shampoo is  a little and smell of shampoo is ordinary i think.&lt;br /&gt;and i have felt neat at my scalp condition</li>
    <li> so far so good, i am using this shampoo from last 1 month. it is no doubt good for your hairs, hair-fall is getting better after every wash. best part is it has no harmful chemical. i will definitely recommend this product for people having hair-fall problem.&lt;br /&gt;nice smell and small amount is good enough. :)</li>
    <li> I have the most unwanted hair type, fine, limp greasy and falling a lot during the winter season. I&#x27;ve tried many fall fight shampoo but they all weigh down the hair and make scalp greasy. This shampoo is pricy but it lathers up well and leaves my hair bouncy &amp; smooth. So far haven&#x27;t seen any changes on loss or regrowth. I&#x27;ll keep using it for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoos but none helped with my hair loss. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I have noticed significantly reduced hair fall. It leaves my hair feeling clean and full. I love how it makes my hair voluminous! I recommend it to everyone dealing with hair loss.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, all natural, makes your hair smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It was delivered promptly, i like the earthy smell and it seems to help with my hair loss. I can&#x27;t tell for sure if it is helping just yet (I haven&#x27;t finished counting my hair yet) but it seems less hair is falling out when washing so fingers crossed. One more bonus is that even though i have rather long hair and i don&#x27;t need to use seperate hair conditioner. It leaves my hair smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> Great product, works the way it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product so I can&#x27;t say how well it works for hair loss but I did notice right away that my hair felt fuller.  It smells nice and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Lathers well and leaves my hair feeling clean.  I did end up ordering their conditioner since my hair tends to tangle easily.</li>
    <li> My husband and I started using it as soon as it arrived.  My husband is very picky with smells and he was hesitant at first.  This shampoo has barely any smell!  We&#x27;ll continue using it in hopes that he won&#x27;t lose any more hair.  So far so good!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo in late November 2014. Although you&#x27;re supposed to wait 3 months to see results, I started swing some in as little as 1 week; my hair wasn&#x27;t falling as much. It&#x27;s been about 2 months now since I started using it and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall off nearly half of what it used to and I started to see a little bit of new growth. Gave it 4 stars since it does dry out hair a bit (I have very thin and oily hair) and it smells a bit weird. Will continue updating as time passes by and adjust the rating accordingly.</li>
    <li> Wow.  I NEVER write reviews but I am so grateful for this product.  It has been 1-2 weeks since I used it and my hair has not fallen out.  I am 30 years old Asian and started to see thinning hair at my edges and when I run my hands through my hair 6-8 strands would fall out easily.  Now since I have used it, none fall out.  This makes me believe that it is working and that my hair is strengthened by whatever is in this product.  I am so glad that I purchased this and I hope it will work for you too if you are considering.  I have done several things before this that did not work, fish oils, supplements, castor oil, tea tree oil.  Never did I think a shampoo could fix all this!  I do not care that it is expensive, this is worth it to me and I only hope to grow hair where I have started to bald.  But for now, the strengthening of my hair is the most improvement I saw thus far.</li>
    <li> Been using for about a month now.  Its not preventing any hair loss, which I really did not expect, but it is making my hair feel healthier which is worth it in itself.  My scalp has been more hydrated as well.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I am not sure how effective in its intended use for only 1 month&#x27;s use. I read other reviews and questions and note that conditioner is not recommended. But I feel my hair is very dry after using it. I suspect that the dryness will greatly impact its effectiveness in hair loss prevention. You need to wash your hair very often since its cleaning power is very limited. So I choose to use Head&amp;Shoulder once in a while.</li>
    <li> Good quality shampoo. Lathers up good and lasts quite a while, I use about 1.5 to 2 pumps per use. A little early to tell if it works for hair loss prevention but it is a good organic shampoo nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I have used Pura d&#x27; or for about two months I like the way it makes my hair feel after shampooing it seems thicker and I haven&#x27;t noticed as much hair  loss. I like the fact that it has all natural ingredients and compared to other products for hair loss the price is reasonable. I will continue to purchase Pura d&#x27;or</li>
    <li> Not overly impressed.  Hair feels knotty after use, even with coordinating conditioner.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than one month,my hair loss is much less now,also my hair looks healthier than before,I&#x27;m happy to find this product after trying many shampoo these years, it works for me.</li>
    <li> I brought this and tried it immediately after receiving the package.  I really like the subtle tea tree oil smell after rinse, and my hair feels clean and a little tingly after wash.  I don&#x27;t know if it will prevent hair-loss as of yet, but I do enjoy the washing experience.  Only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that after blow drying, my hair feels a but dry.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really nice for your help. I feel my hair is not greasy anymore. Regarding the hair loss part, I think it will takes time to prove that. So far, I&#x27;m really satisfy with it.</li>
    <li> just used it last nite and so far its okie smell is strong. need time to see if it helps better hair and prevent hair loss. the only down side I found is there is not much bubble so had to squeeze more quantity to feel the cleanse effect. will rate again in a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week, so I can&#x27;t say if it is helping my thinning hair yet, but I can say that it feels really light compared to all the other shampoos I have tried that have natural oils in them, which is great. I can get away with only washing every other day now, which is definitely better on my hair. I am also using the conditioner that goes with this and like that as well.</li>
    <li> this is a great product, i&#x27;ve been using it every other day for a couple of weeks and my hair is already starting to look thicker! I love this product! ( and it smells really good )</li>
    <li> my wife said my hair gorwing up!!I think this product works fine for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different shampoos and this one is my favorite. It is a great product</li>
    <li> Used a couple of times, have not seen significant change yet but I feel my hair is less oily, which means I do not have to wash it everyday and off course, less hair wash, less hair loss</li>
    <li> Liars, they tell everyone to write a review and get one for free!! Thats why its has high reviews, its not really much of a different compared to any regular shampoo besides its smell bad</li>
    <li> There is definitely less hair in the catcher in the tub after I used this product. I noticed that only after day 3 of using this product.  After chemotherapy, my hair had grown back fine. However, it kept falling out even though I used Nioxin Shampoo and Conditioner. With those products, my hair also felt drier. On some days, it even made my scalp itchy just like the Jason Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner. The worst for me was Herbal Essences. My hair is now almost shoulder length after I have had 3 haircuts post-chemo growth. And I only need to use 2 pumps of this shampoo to wash my entire head. Would definitely recommend for cancer patients on the mend like myself.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this shampoo for her hair and it has been an amazing purchase for her. She has said that her hair has grown and that it feels thicker and fuller. She absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I have seen the hair loss has decreased. It has also made my hair look fuller. I would recommend this product. Thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> This product is solid, it does what is supposed to as far as making hair rich and more full.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m allergic to something in this shampoo, but I changed to this after using Paul Mitchel&#x27;s tea leaf shampoo because I was losing my hair.......  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helped with the hair loss but this shampoo makes my head itch so badly I can&#x27;t keep using it.</li>
    <li> I just received the product and tried it immediately. Right now I do not know whether it can help the regrowth of my hair, but I would be extremely happy if it works. The smell is different from other shampoos which probably shows it is organic and the feel is good. I think my hair is not that greasy one day later. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 4 months ago and have been using it often.  Prior to using this product, my hair would fall out in clumps in the shower to the point where I was concerned.  My hairdresser recommended for me to look for products that could strengthen my hair and I came across this product.  After using this for one month, I noticed that my hair was not falling out as much!  I love that this product works and is also organic.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works great for cleaning. The smell is really good too. I have been using it for three weeks and hope that it works as well as it is advertised in prevention of hair loss.</li>
    <li> Smells SO nice! I am in love with this shampoo, and it&#x27;s conditioner counterpart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have hair loss, it just seemed like the most appealing product for me.</li>
    <li> Have been Using this Shampoo for almost 3 months. I have No complaints. My hair looks more healthy after use. One of my friend also liked it after using it a couple of times and then he ordered a new one for himself. Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for few days but right off the bat I really like the smell and my scalp feels refreshed after using it. The bottle and pump quality is good and I believe it&#x27;s a great deal for a container that size. I will update my review as I start to see the positive impact. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair. I used this Shampoo and I found out there is a significant difference in hair loss. Leaves hair smooth. Have to use to 2-3 times though for each shampoo to get rid of oil. Would surely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product !! Just started using it and found it good.</li>
    <li> I use it for preventative reasons so I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working, but it lasts quite a while, 3-4months; so despite its high price, it is not expensive in the end.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing.  It lathered up great and left my hair so soft and manageable.  I love this shampoo and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is good. But I have to say the effect is not so obvious.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It manages the hair from frizz and makes thin hair look thick. I will continue to use this shampoo for a couple more months and see what happens! Cant wait!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using for two weeks now and so far have not seen anything different. Maybe I need to continue use for more time. Will use for a couple of months and see if theres any changes or results.</li>
    <li> Good product! Smells good and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair flaky! It&#x27;ll be a while to see if does lessen hairloss!</li>
    <li> So far this shampoo is great to use for my hair. I feel like I&#x27;m losing less hair everyday.</li>
    <li> This product truly controls flaking and itching.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely.  Did not irritate my scalp. Shipped promptly!  Not sure if it works yet because I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time. First things first, for me, it doesn&#x27;t do much for hair loss at all. I&#x27;m still losing hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement at all. However, I do like this shampoo and will continue to use it. Mainly for the fact that it is all organic with no harsh chemicals and I love the way it lathers on my hair. It is a way better alternative to any other shampoo you can buy at the store. I have very long, curly hair, and it feels great after using this.</li>
    <li> I just starting using this because I have oily greasy hair and it has definitely reduced the oil and made my scalp less itchy. My hair was slightly thinning, however the shampoo seems to make it more fuller. I am not sure about regrowth of hair since I have not been using this long.Hope this product could protect my loss hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work for me and that makes too much dandruff ...waste money..</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit bad and it seems to dry hair my hair out. But... I do believe my hair seems fuller. I will update this post if I see a hair loss reduction.</li>
    <li> It calms down my fine, frizzy, angry menopausal hair, cleaning without weighing down or stripping it.  It&#x27;s made mostly of natural ingredients- good for my hair and ecologically non-toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is exorbitant even considering the organic ingredients, but it&#x27;s the best organic shampoo for my hair.  I can&#x27;t really attest to the effectiveness of hair loss prevention because I use generic Rogaine (Equate minoxidil).  I stopped using the minoxidil on a regular basis which, possibly along with menopause, caused hair loss.  I returned to use of minoxidil and started using this shampoo and my hair is growing back but I can&#x27;t attribute it solely to the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to address hair loss I highly recommend using minoxidil (2% for women, 5% for men) before trying Pura d&#x27;or unless you&#x27;re committed to using only natural remedies, in which case you may want to read on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a medical study done in Scotland that showed promising hair growth results through the use of a combination of essential oils.  The oils included rosemary, cedarwood, lavender and thyme along with grapeseed and jojoba oils.  I tried this combination but didn&#x27;t use it often enough as I only wash my hair every three days and the concoction left my fine hair too oily, but it worked quite well for the study subjects.  I copied the following from nutritionbreakthroughs.com article named \\&quot;A Natural Solution for Hair Loss\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A revolutionary aromatherapy study was recently published in the Archives of Dermatology (1).  Isabelle C. Hay and co-researchers from the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in Scotland studied 86 people with diagnosed alopecia areata.  The trial lasted seven months and while the trial took place, the participants stopped using topical (skin) and oral alopecia medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, half of the people used a blend of cedarwood (2 drops), lavender (3 drops), rosemary (3 drops) and thyme (2 drops), in a carrier oil mix of jojoba oil (1/2 teaspoon) and grapeseed oil (4 teaspoons). The placebo group used just the carrier oils.  Patients were taught to massage the oil into the bare areas of their scalp for two minutes each evening and then wrap a warm towel around their head to enhance absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of the study, and again after three and seven months, professional photographs were taken of each patient&#x27;s scalp. Changes as seen in the photographs served as the primary outcome measure.  Mapping and measuring of the bald patches was also done to determine results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An impressive 44 percent of the group using the essential oils significantly improved.  The average area of hair regrowth with the essential oils was 104 square centimeters, compared with nearly zero for those using the placebo.  According to one intriguing photograph provided by the researchers, considerable hair regrowth occurred with one male patient who had both alopecia areata and severe male pattern hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These results show aromatherapy to be a safe and effective treatment for alopecia areata.  The researchers were proud to have successfully applied an evidence-based method to an alternative therapy.  Evidently, one or more of the essential oils is able to promote hair regrowth.  And unlike standard medical therapies, the essential oils have a very low risk of side effects and are not nearly as costly.&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful Tips: After getting the essential oils, go to your local drugstore and get a small plastic mixing bottle with a pointed tip opening (that holds about 4 ounces), for applying the oils to your scalp.  Get a small liquid dropper with teaspoon measuring lines for drawing in liquids.  This is for measuring the carrier oils into the mixing bottle.  Plastic gloves are helpful as undiluted essential oils can be very strong. The essential oil bottles come with a guide attached to the inside ofthe bottle mouth which allows for easy control of how many drops come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix all the ingredients together and massage into your scalp each evening wearing plastic gloves.  You can make up enough for 2 or 3 applications at once to save time. Use a plastic shower cap if you&#x27;d like to keep the oils working overnight, otherwise leave them on for at least an hour and then wash out in the shower.  Keep in mind:  the study described above lasted for 7 months, so give this natural remedy a good try, and enjoy the benefits of these powerful oils</li>
    <li> Works nice but too pricey.</li>
    <li> Love this product…the smell could be improved upon.  My hubby said it smells like the inside of a lumber mill.  It works great and stops the breakage I used to have with other top brand shampoos.</li>
    <li> I I actually got this as a gift and I didn&#x27;t believe it either I started using it after I got my hair colored and it was done wrong my hair fell out a lot before but when I dyed it it got worse I was losing chunks and its cause my hair was breaking believe it or not this stuff stopped the breaking brought my hair back to life made my hair grow faster and stronger then it was. My hair grows fast to start with (about an inch per month) so now it grows exactly 1.7 inches per month trust me it&#x27;s worth getting I tried everything before this and I happen to luck out my boyfriend whos insecure about his hair has also noticed it about my hair too</li>
    <li> It DOES tangle your hair! But that isn&#x27;t a huge problem if you use a detangling comb. My hair did feel softer after using this. I will continue to use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Ah now, I really do like this product.  It arrived safe and sound here in the UK on the date as specified.  When I used it for the first time I found that my hair had that bounce that it had many years ago. Also the texture had improved as well!  What more can I say. Even without the Hair loss prevention  results, this is a quality product and is getting prime position  in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a year now. I can say that my hair seems a lot thicker but do not notice any new hair growth. I will never know if this shampoo is preventing further hair loss but will definitely continue using it for the long term.</li>
    <li> I was not overly or underly impressed.  I bought it because it is an organic hair loss prevention but didn&#x27;t care too much for it</li>
    <li> Perhaps I am not the target user for this product. I am 26, and have way less than 5% of my hair grey. Having black hair, the greys are noticeable. I bought this product in November, so I made sure to give it plenty of time. The smell is different, but that is not the reason we are here, plus, you will get used to it. I&#x27;ve noticed that my scalp is healthier, normally it gets very dry. However, I still have the greys. I doubt I&#x27;ll spend $37 on this bottle of shampoo next time around.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s expensive but it seems to be working (which sucks right? Because now I have to keep buying). It&#x27;s hard to say exactly what&#x27;s working, but my hair loss has stopped. I have been using minoxidil 5%, azelaic acid 20% at nights, and saw palmetto with nettle root 3 times a week, along with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s a lot of things but I didn&#x27;t want to lose my hair so I created this stack. And I didn&#x27;t want to take a pharmaceutical DHT blockers like Propecia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it may dry your scalp, so if you&#x27;re anything like me, you will anti dandruff shampoo at least a couple of times a week (I used the generic brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, if you&#x27;re looking to stop hair loss you will need as a PART of you routine; but I doubt it&#x27;ll do it by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, take this into account: in all studies minoxidil takes an average of 6 months to show results, Propecia takes about 1 year, what makes you think this will take any less? You need to stick with whatever you&#x27;re trying for at least 6 months, and then make judgement. A lot of those 1 star comments on many products are given after 2 or 3 weeks of using, c&#x27;mon now be serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want more details on my stack, hit me up. You can replace what I recommend with generics or whatever, I don&#x27;t get a cut from anyone (I wish I would). I was just really bummed out about hair loss and I think I can help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this item. It lasts me about 6 months, so I do not mind the price. I have seen a difference in my hair-&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this  item.</li>
    <li> I still use this shampoo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this shampoo. I was using another Argan-based shampoo but switched to Pura d-or because I like the ingredient list much better. I try to minimize chemicals in and on my body and use organic products whenever I can. A little goes a long way, it cleans my hair well and it gives my hair incredible shine. I&#x27;ll be sticking with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, itchy scalp and scaly buildup for years. So much that I&#x27;ve had to keep shaving my head as a last resource to keep the itching at bay. Come to find out it&#x27;s related to excess DHT hormone. Using this shampoo 95% of the itch is gone. My scalp just feels healthier, oily in a good way, and my hair feels soft and moist. Really impressed.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product because I was looking for a natural solution to improve my hair... I lost quite a bit of it a few years ago and it&#x27;s been very thin ever since. This shampoo makes me hair look very full and healthy. I&#x27;m not sure if it truly has made any hair grow back, because it wasn&#x27;t so much loss that it&#x27;s easy to tell one way or another. But I will say that it appears to have improved the volume of my hair and I no longer have a bald spot to cover. For me it&#x27;s well worth the cost.. and it really does last a long time. I use about half a pump each day and it lasts for months. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent which I love. Be aware that it won&#x27;t really suds up a lot and you have to leave it on for a few minutes for it to be effective. I just bought my 2nd bottle and got the conditioner to go with it. Everyone&#x27;s different so you might not get the same results as I did, but I&#x27;m hoping you do!</li>
    <li> it works but it just makes your hair all slugdy.. its not really growing anythign back that i can tell..</li>
    <li> We are now using this product for the past 2 months.. We are so happy and satisfied by this product.&lt;br /&gt;It really helped in reducing the hair loss and gave a nice texture to the hair.. I highly recommend this product to others..</li>
    <li> No chemical smell nor feel in my head. Very soft shampoo. Hair stays clean, soft and moistened. No more hair in my hands after the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say any new hair growth is minimal, but there are a few new strands. Even without the newbies, I&#x27;d buy this shampoo again. It  adds volume and shine to my fine hair. I pair it with the conditioner, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the outcome. No, it doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or flowery, but does smell a lot like rosemary. I prefer the cleaner smell. I thought it was expensive at first, but &amp;#34;a little dab will do ya&amp;#34;. It will be a while before I finish the bottle, but I definitely intend to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith, trust comes later. This is what happen to me when I was searching for a solution of my hair fall. I listened to my friend and I started using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo. I also use its conditioner. Together they are working wonders for me. My hair fall is gone. I have longer, stronger, shinier, better and beautiful hair now. My hair growth is more now and also dullness is gone. Its amazing how purd d’or has given my beautiful hair back to me.</li>
    <li> I rarely leave a review for a product but after having used this product for awhile I have to tell people about it. Not only is it organic but it does everything it says it does. We have bad hair loss in our family at a young age. Thanks to this product I have made longer than anyone else in my family with a full head of hair that is soft and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that my aunt cuts hair and now recommends this product to her clients. She went on and on about how my hair was the some of the healthiest looking hair she has seen. If you are not using this product you are missing out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done research on the ingredients that have been proven to strengthen thinning hair in men. There will not be a shampoo that will make you regrow the hair you&#x27;ve already lost, but Pura d&#x27;or is a great, all-in-one shampoo that combines most of the desired products to prevent further loss and strengthen the currently weak hair. I&#x27;ve used it for a while now and I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that you have to give this stuff time to work. You can&#x27;t try it for a week and then declare it ineffective. You should also recognize that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is a little bit different. That said, this stuff has worked great for me. I&#x27;ve noticed a slow-down in hair loss, and the increase in volume is nice. The two work together to turn back time, so to speak. The formula leaves my scalp a bit dry sometimes, so I follow up with a moisterizer. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> i been use this shampoo for a wail and helper my hair a lat and i like because is organic</li>
    <li> Great product. We love how this shampoo works on our hair. Too soon to tell on the DHT removing properties, but it leaves hair smooth and full.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo to prevent hair loss, and found that it works for preventing hair loss, plus it makes my hair feel thick and soft. I have used it for a year now, and can tell a noticeable difference, with healthy hair growth and reduced hair loss.</li>
    <li> Gives great volume to my hair and renewed confidence in my personal appearance.  I recommend this highly to anyone who has thinning hair or is thinning out due to natural causes.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair looks fuller and shinier than it has in years.  I am a fan of Purador argan oil products that have moisturizing properties that benefit hair skin and nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loretta</li>
    <li> Since I started using this shampoo, not only that my hair stopped from falling off for no reason, but it also gives some signs that it is ready to regenerate. I am definitely going to try some other shampoos from this brand.</li>
    <li> I saw and felt the difference after my very first use. My hair is very fine, and it looked fuller and felt softer..it was definitely more manageable!</li>
    <li> love ittttt can not wait to purchase more!</li>
    <li> Within a month of using this my hair seems noticeably thicker to others. Nice to find a shampoo that actually works for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of products, until I have found Pura d&#x27;or anti hairloss shampoo. Since I have started using it I csn see the digference. My hair is shining all the time, looks healthy and there is lots of small hair growing out on the scalp. You can see how the hair is regenerating.</li>
    <li> Its great!! I like it!!!</li>
    <li> I am using the hairmax laser comb and taking propecia. The Rogaine did not work for me. I wanted a product that would keep my hair healthy. I dont know what is working but this is one of the things I am using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing very messy shipping. The bottle leaked and alot of shampoo leaked out</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks. So far I love it. I also love the pureness of the ingredients. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> It is somewhat more natural than other products, but do not confuse that with efficacy.  This does nothing for hair loss.  It did not cause any regrowth.  It is heavily scented and not as natural as it pretends to be.</li>
    <li> I do like this shampoo.  I have noticed that I&#x27;m back to the normal amount of hair in the drain, instead of the increased amount I was seeing, even without using every day, because, yes, it is expensive.  It lathers nicely and leaves my hair looking and feeling fuller.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say it leaves their scalp dry, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed that.  Again, this could be because I only use this shampoo about 3x a week.</li>
    <li> The constancy in this shampoo is perfect. You can feel it working. Unlike most shampoos who claim to give life to fine hair, after shampooing with this product, my hair feels much thicker and fuller. looking forward to long term results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now. Remember to select the &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; formula specifically. Also, a user must leave the lathered shampoo on their scalp for at least several minutes. The herbal formula is very effective in leaving one&#x27;s hair thicker and with a non-oily texture. I believe that the DHT makes hair feel more oily than usual. For those of you that subscribe to the theory that DHT can be eliminated from the scalp through daily cleansing with special shampoos,  this product seems to fulfill that premise. Also, I use Nizoral and T-gel as well. It is probably best to use the T-gel for the first round of shampoo treatment and then using this product with Nizoral for best results in terms of appearance. The only drawback to this product is that it always costs $27-35 per bottle; I use about two pumps per day so it lasts more than just several weeks. However, I just wish I could use a healthy amount much like other effective shampoos such as Head and Shoulders. Other than that, this shampoo is excellent for men prone to hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have received the shampoo and like the way it lathers and smells. I like the way it leaves my hair and scalp. Shipping was fast and direct.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and I&#x27;m eager to try it.</li>
    <li> So I recently bought this item. I was worried about the smell and its not that bad. Also after I used it I noticed my hair got a little dry so get a nice conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for couple of weeks and although it is early to make a true assessment of its ability to prevent hair loss, I can safely say that it gave my hair an extra volume. I liked the smell too. I also feel like there are less chemicals remained on my hair after the shower. This might not be a truly objective statement but compared to Nioxin, Pura Dor felt more a like a shampoo than a chemical solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comment is about the price. You can 33.8 oz Nioxin at the same price. Maybe Pura Dor should also give 33.8 oz option without doubling the price of 16oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add comments about its effectiveness on hair loss prevention after couple of months.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s only been a week so far but my hair felt squeaky clean from the first shampoo. As well my hair definitely feels thicker and there is almost no hair loss at this point. Although my hair does not look as shiny as it could look but time will tell.</li>
    <li> So far this is pretty good, like many other products this make the promise to prevent hair loss and increase thickness, what is sure is it keeps your hair quite clean, fresh, and with a good diet results can be observed.</li>
    <li> I came across this product when I started noticing thinning of my hair and some hair loss. Started looking for shampoos that would aid in hair re growth and block DTH and came across this shampoo. I could not be any more happier. This shampoo is natural organic shampoo with no SLS and parabens thus resulting in hair looking healthy. My hair has stopped falling drastically and looks much more healthier. I would recommend this shampoo if you are looking for an organic shampoo.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not sure about the hair loss prevention bit, I will say this is a high quality shampoo. It smells nice (to me anyway) but not overpoweringly so like some shampoos. It leaves my hair feeling clean without the industrial clean feeling of some shampoos; which is to say, I think since this shampoo doesn&#x27;t use any SLS (detergent) it doesn&#x27;t completely remove all the oil from my hair. The pump works well and I&#x27;ve been able to get all the shampoo from the bottom of the bottle. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this shampoo again in the future.</li>
    <li> This shampoo allows you to use it daily without feeling like it is drying out your scalp. I used to shampoo every 2 or 3 days because my hair would dry out fast, but this allows me to shampoo daily. I&#x27;m not 100% sure if it actually helps with hair loss, but I still have my hair, so I&#x27;m not complaining. I just bought my second bottle after using the first one for 1.5 years fairly daily.</li>
    <li> This is expensive for shampoo, make no mistake. I&#x27;m a 29 year old guy who could care less about the organic properties of this stuff. I just wanted it for the hair loss help. After only a couple uses I noticed a big difference. Normally while washing my hair in the shower my hair just comes out and I have strands all over my hands. With this product I don&#x27;t have that as much. I also noticed my hair felt stronger, softer, and noticed a big volume boost. It also smells great, minty and light - almost like the Aveda shampoos that my wife loves. I&#x27;m combining this hair loss shampoo with some vitamins and Rogaine to see if I can get my bald spot to fill in.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!! Before using I noticed clumps of hair falling our when I would brush, now its very little, I think this product not only prevents hair loss but also strengthens. Very impressed by this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever;  it was amazing and I&#x27;m practically like a younger version of myself with my hair.  It definitely  prevented my hair loss,  highly recommended to everyone!</li>
    <li> So far have only used this shampoo a couple times but love the smell. Did not have much hair loss in the shower while rinsing. Hoping for great results!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for 2 weeks on regular basis.I am Male user.  I was using Nioxin shampoo number 2 before.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I found out.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Softer hair than Nioxin. I helps to improve the look of your hair more fuller. I am not sure if it actually helps to grow more hair yet since I have used it for 2 weeks only.Feels like it has natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I am still noticing moderate hair fall. Hair fall is lesser than Pantene shampoo but definitely more than Nioxin.</li>
    <li> product works good!, great smell with an affordable price. definately going to purchase another bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost 2 months now. It lathers great, I don&#x27;t have to use very much and I like the smell. Like I said, I&#x27;ve had the bottle for almost two months now and I&#x27;m barely half way through it and I have very long hair. My hair definitely feels healthier, softer and thicker. But I have not noticed my hair loss slowing down at all. I have been under quite a bit of stress so who knows. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and I would like to try their conditioner at some point too.</li>
    <li> This product has actually have my scalp the cleanest it&#x27;s been in awhile.  Great Product</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak directly for the hair loss prevention efficacy (since I am also taking finasteride to halt my hair loss), however I am very pleased with the quality of this shampoo regardless.  The shampoo lathers nicely, leaves my hair feeling clean and fresh, and smells great.  That it contains no harsh chemicals and includes ingredients that are said to stop hair loss is an added benefit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo not fully believing it would help my problem. I&#x27;d been worried because I&#x27;d been losing hair at an alarming rate and nothing seemed to help.  I have to say that after 3 weeks I have noticed a vast improvement. I would say that every time I shower I lose at the most 10 to 20 hairs.. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is stronger and shinier a lot more manageable and less frizzy. I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying :)</li>
    <li> My husband likes this product so far.  He has been using this shampoo for 1 week and feels like his hair is fuller.  It smells really good, too.  We both enjoy that!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for slightly over a month now. Switched to it because I was noticing significantly increased hair loss after some lifestyle changes. I&#x27;m seeing less hair on my pillow so the hair loss prevention might have already started to work. But most importantly, my hair feels much healthier than before. If not immediately after a shower, definitely later throughout the day. Before this my hair would get dry and puffy; now it feels smoother, better nourished and less dry without any additional products. It wont give you an artificial &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell. It has a very faint smell that I am ambivalent about. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and will continue using it indefinitely.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any hair loss prevention but i do like the fact that it is organic and free of sulfates</li>
    <li> I started seeing thin spots on my scalp right after I started Menopause.  After a lot of research I found that this is one of very few shampoo&#x27;s out there that blocks DHT which causes hair thinning and loss.  More expensive products like Nioxin do not have those ingredients.  This is gentle, effect, lathers well and smells great.</li>
    <li> Two new to tell yet. Used twice.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair smooth and it seems to be preventing my hair loss. Ive been using this shampoo for a while on my mothers recommendation and my hair feels thicker. It also de-frizzes my hair a bit.</li>
    <li> It is my first purchase of this product. I am gonna write it about a few months later.</li>
    <li> First Claim: Number one amazon best seller for hair loss prevention shampoo year 2012 and 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does prevent hair loss. I suffered from hair loss. I would often see balls of hair in the shower drain after each wash which was about once per week. After about 5 weeks, I see a dramatic reduction in the amount of hair I lose in each wash. It is normal to lose hair, for we shed about 100 hair each day, but the amount of hair loss that I was seeing before was too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Claim: Increases volume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is definitely thicker than before. The thickness is noticeable; I really like this because I&#x27;m slowly gaining my confidence back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third Claim: Supports healthy hair growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am retaining length. Hair loss was preventing me from retaining length. This product does support healthy hair growth, primarily by preventing the hair from breaking off. Within the 5 weeks of use, I can see about 1.5 inches of new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth Claim: New and improved formula with advanced DHT blocker blend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really speak on the old formula, but I can speak on DHT. For those who don&#x27;t know, DHT is an enzyme synthesized in the hair follicles to prevent hair loss. As mentioned earlier, my hair loss has decreased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last/ Fifth Claim: No SLS (sulfates); No parabens; No DEA; No harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfates and Parabens are known to strip the hair of its moisture. My hair has definitely felt more moisturized and healthier. This product is organic, and affordable (which is what I like)! With 16 oz of product, you are only paying about $1.50/oz. What a deal!</li>
    <li> I really adore this product!! I’ve been reading most of these reviews, positive and negative, but I should say it really worked for me. Once I owned a dry hair with no nourishing at all with a dry scalp which stressed me out every time. I was so scared because my hair started losing in a pattern which I’ve heard is worst. I tried many shampoos, oils, tonics, conditioners spending much on shops and online for a result which seems a nightmare for me.&lt;br /&gt;And this miracle happened when I first use Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil shampoo. All I tried initially was trying it for a week to know if it works for me. First thing which I noticed after around a week was my hair getting stronger and nourishing and it doesn’t seems to get washed off when I was washing my hair. Then my hair got thickened and hair breakage was hardly noticed. This made me more confident to use the product and after continued usage it really reduced my hair fall.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus is you’ll notice some new hair growth as well and you won’t hate the fragrance as well. To be honest this product really does what it says on the reviews of the benefited users and I should say this is the best shampoo I’ve ever used and I would recommend this to anyone without hesitations. Just try it once and you’ll feel the difference and comfort which will give your hair. The best thing is it’s organic and affordable!! I really trust this product and love this!!</li>
    <li> With hair thinning for quite a few years, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different shampoos that promise thickening and/or loss prevention.  This is my second order of pura d&#x27; or ... and that&#x27;s not happened before.  A bottle lasts a long time and if I haven&#x27;t had much hair come back ... I&#x27;m not sure, so if it has it hasn&#x27;t been a lot ... this seems to be fulfilling it&#x27;s promise of preventing loss.  Besides, I like the way my hair feels and looks after I use it.  I&#x27;ll keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss prevention shampoo. I can honestly say that I have noticed a difference, so I am pretty happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer see hair on my bathtub after I wash my hair. I think it has helped me, I don&#x27;t use any other products to prevent hair loss. It leaves my hair clean and shiny, although I need to use some conditioner, otherwise my hair is too dried. I followed the instructions and leave the shampoo for about 1-2 minutes and massage my scalp for a while, I am not sure if that contributes to the efficiency of the product, but I do it anyway. I am OK with the scent, don&#x27;t love it but don&#x27;t hate it either, it is not something I would base my decision on though. I would definitely recommend the shampoo to those that have moderate hair loss.</li>
    <li> I love this product and my order came very quickly. I like to use pure products to combat my hair loss due to an auto-immune disorder and have used many. This one is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Two years ago I had a bad bought of seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp followed my an infection from what I can only presume were less than sanitary practices of a hair braider.  All of that trauma on my scalp coupled with the harshness of the prescription oil, shampoo, and antibiotics left my scalp healed but with bald patches.  My temples and nape were ravaged.  I then resorted to going natural as I was then afraid to have any chemicals touch my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo Brown and Blue and Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Argan Oil Conditioner  two months ago here on Amazon and gave it a shot based on the reviews.  I fell in love after the first shampoo.  My natural hair was soft and easy to manage after using it, so much so that it reminded me of my previously relaxed hair.  I resumed relaxing my hair two and a half weeks ago.  What an amazing find!  My relaxed hair responds equally as well.  I shampooed and conditioned my hair a week after the relaxer and my hair was just as soft and beautiful as when the salon products were used, only this product is organic and oh so good for my hair and scalp.  Both my temples and nape are filling in slowly but surely (Yay!!! progress is better than no)  I so look forward to providing additonal review updates on the growth of my hair; as I notice a measurable difference in the texture and elasticity overall and growth and/or fuzz in the spots where I&#x27;d thought my scalp was so damaged no hair would regrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying this is snake oil that will regrow your hair.  What I am saying is that it promotes healthy scalp resulting in an environment primed for grow with a good hair care regime.  Being a natural also taught me the importance of treating my hair as delicately as I would silk so my hair care practices are meticulous and I take my time  which is paying off with the help, of these products (blue label shampoo and conditioner, biotin supplement 5,000 mg).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.  I love my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;(I am also using extra dark Jamaican Black Castor Oil, shampooing and hair steam deep conditioning weekly.  I have also incorporated a 5 in 1 reconstructor every other week for the next month or two since I relaxed my hair).  I also do avocado and coconut oil pre shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted this same review on the conditioner, since it was a team effort.e my hair again.

    <li> This Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, Brown and Blue really works great for me. I have allergies to many of the products on the market due to my skin problems, and was looking for a product that would help stop my thinning hair without irritating my scalp. So far this product seems to be working very well. I have seen less hair coming out for the past few months since a short time after I began using it. I also love that it&#x27;s organic, and not harmful to the environment. The fragrance is nice, in my opinion, unlike other products that have the horrible chemical smell. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a product to help stop their thinning hair, whether they have allergy problems or not. All I can say is another great product from pura d&#x27;or  that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. It has given very good results in my hair, no more dandruff, even has understated hair loss, leaves hair silky and shiny and best of all, it&#x27;s organic at a great price.</li>
    <li> first of all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the second bottle i bought though it came from groupon one years ago, yes, it cost 20bucks. (but the deal no longer available ), after i used it , i found less oil came out from my damn oily hair, after that, i tried the cheaper but very famous brand&amp;#34;avalon B&amp;#34;,U know that,the result is ............no work for me , i have to switch the first choice, i search the products and finally got from amazon, i hope it keeps the better action to my terrible hair conditon......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past three months. I saw results after only using if for couple of weeks. The rate of hair loss decreased noticeably. The shampoo lathers beautifully and cleans nicely. After years I am letting my hair grow because it is no longer lifeless! After washing my hair with this shampoo and towel drying, I rub a small amount of Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil in my hair and I am ready to go! I have recommended this shampoo to my coworkers, friends and family. My husband is using it as well. For the price this is the best shampoo to prevent hair loss in the market.</li>
    <li> I saw this shampoo from a Groupon opportunity and thought to give it a try. My hair has taken some life-long abuse from styling tools and products and from the looks of the ingredients, I felt inclined to try it—a few of the ingredients were similar vitamin supplements I take. The scent is pleasing, it feels somewhat conditioning and surprisingly, despite it being a non SLS/paraben shampoo, it still lathers. It doesn’t dry out my scalp and although I still end up with some hair in the drain, I have noticed shinier hair with a bit more resilience to breakage. This is still a new product but I am hopeful with continued use.</li>
    <li> I have been slowly losing my hair over the last few years and have tried numerous products. This has been the best thing for my hair ever! I noticed within the first week that I wasn&#x27;t losing any more hair. I will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> I read previous comments an decided to give this a try, and I found this product to be really good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I love it.  Prior to using Pura d&#x27; or  my hair was thinning, becoming dry and staticky. Immediately after the first use I noticed a change.  My hair was no longer uncontrollable with static electricity.  The shin, texture and fullness has been restored to my hair with continued use.</li>
    <li> I am new to this shampoo, but very experienced with shampoos that claim to be \\&quot;good\\&quot; for your hair and scalp. It&#x27;s too soon to tell  if this helps prevent hair loss, but it is an elegant shampoo. It works up on the head easily and doesn&#x27;t irritate. While I&#x27;m concerned about increasing hair loss, this may be a function of my age and health. I have always had issues with shampoos inflaming and otherwise irritating my scalp to the point where it is painful all the time. Nothing seems to help. What I want is a pleasant-to-use shampoo that does not irritate my scalp. So far so good. Enough so that I am willing to try Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s other products.&lt;br /&gt;I am skeptical about claims of \\&quot;hair loss prevention\\&quot; and \\&quot;grows hair\\&quot; (except for minoxidol, which I&#x27;m unwilling to use); if consumer based products were that successful, the companies would be millionaires and no one would suffer from bad hair. However, I was willing to plunk down $29 for a bottle of shampoo, and thus far I don&#x27;t regret it. I&#x27;d love to say it helped hair loss. If it does in future months, I&#x27;ll return and give it 5 stars. For now, I&#x27;m happy that it doesn&#x27;t cause hair loss as some shampoos do, and I&#x27;m happy with the state it leaves my hair in after use.</li>
    <li> I am a woman &amp; my hair falls out everywhere, very annoying , I was hoping this would have worked!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It works great and always leaves my hair feeling silky soft.  This might be my favorite shampoo ever!!!</li>
    <li> I wash my hair every single day. Using a single pump every day, I was able to make this last from the beginning of September last year all the way through June of this year. That&#x27;s almost ten months of use from a single bottle! This shampoo is supple and smooth -- when I apply it, I don&#x27;t have any tugging or pulling on my hair as with some other shampoos, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair as much as others do either. I&#x27;m stopping in to write this review on my way to purchasing another big bottle. I can&#x27;t speak to whether it trues prevents hair loss -- I haven&#x27;t lost a lot since I&#x27;ve been using that, but it could be related to any number of things. Nevertheless, I really like this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about three weeks now, washing my hair every other day. The first time I used it, I had almost double the hair loss and it freaked me out! However, I kept using it, and now I see a significant reduction in the amount of hair falling out in the shower and when I comb my hair (about one third of the loss I was having a few weeks ago). The shampoo feels nice when I lather it in and leaves my hair soft. So far I think this is a good product! I recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> I did noticed less hair shedding after using the shampoo. My hair was also soft. I will be buying the conditioner also to maximize the effects.</li>
    <li> I tend to use a little more of this conditioner than other brands but it gets the tangles out &amp; I love the smell. Plus it&#x27;s made from great ingredients!</li>
    <li> This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t give me dry itchy scalp.  I can&#x27;t say that my hair has stopped thinning and that I&#x27;m no longer experiencing hair loss but I can that the remaining hair does look healthy and perhaps over time, hair loss will stop.  Wish I tried this product when the hair loss first started.  As an added bonus, the shampoo smells great!</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this to steer away from chemicals. Ive already noticed a difference in the manageability and condition of my hair overall. It smells pretty good as well.</li>
    <li> good product, just like description. it has a particular odor,as plants. But works</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I am a middle aged, African American woman with shoulder length relaxed hair. I considered going natural, but relaxed is easier to manage with my hectic schedule.  For years I have been searching for more natural products that would clean as well as nourish my thinning hair and not leave too many strands on the floor each time I combed. I have tried an array of shampoos and conditioning products in an effort to find something that would help restore my locks to its former thickness and luster.  This is it!  Pura d&#x27;or is everything: it&#x27;s organic, sulfate free, contains argon oil, helps prevent hair loss, and it leaves my hair glossy and untangled. When I shampoo now, I will leave it on my hair a couple of minutes before rinsing, then follow with the Pura d&#x27;or conditioner. I have been using Pura d&#x27;or for about two months, and I love the results. This shampoo sets the standard.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised, used only once so far so cannot tell if it is working.</li>
    <li> Even though the product didn&#x27;t work for me, customer service from Pura d&#x27;or contacted me to make things right.  I really appreciate them standing behind their product.  I understand these types of products may not work for everyone but hopefully some may get benefit from it.</li>
    <li> After checking the reviews i tried myself and really it worked but when i was out of my shampoo after 15 days my hair started to fall like before.&lt;br /&gt;But i really like it because my bath tub use to have lot of hair before when i use this product i cannot see much hair fall.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 3 months ago.  On the first day I used it, I felt this shampoo is very gentle and it made my hair felt very flesh.  There&#x27;s not much smell of this shampoo, the smell is very good for me.  I usually wash my hair in the morning since I have oily hair.  I am a 38 years old male and have hair loss problem for more than 10 years.  My hair and head always covered by oil after one night sleeping, so I have to wash my hair every morning before work.  After about one month, I notice that the oil on my hair was less than before and there&#x27;s much less inching on my head, so I have more faith to use this product.  After about 2 months, I notice some small hair on my forehead getting stronger and grow longer and darker, and I noticed on my pillow there&#x27;s less hair left on the it than before, so I know that this product has a positive result on my hair loss problem.  The result is not instant and it works slowly to improve my hair loss condition.  Thus, I have faith on this product and will continually to use it in the future, probably my whole life since this is the only shampoo I found so gentle on my hair, make me so refresh every morning.  This a true review of this product.  Thanks and God bless this company to bring good and natural products for people so we can avoid chemical pollution to our world!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shampoo for 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen  results already. I noticed less hair falling after each shower and more hair growth now. I am very pleased with the results and will continue to use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> A great replacement for Nioxin since they changed their formula in 2012 (Nioxin no longer blocks DHT--this does).  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> No difference. Nothing, Nada. The only difference was it made my hair get oily real fast.</li>
    <li> Firstly I am skeptical about this product but after using it for weeks I find out it really works, my hair stop losing that much and the scalp looks cleaner and with less itchy feeling that my wife even notice that, right now she starts to use it too. Definitely I would recommend this to my friends .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mahalo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pui</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I am suprised. You never know what to expect when ordering a new product boasting hair loss prevention......but I can say that the amount of hair lost in the shower is immensly less than before I started using this product. I was also worried about my hair being oily, since it is an oil shampoo, but it has not been this way at all. The only qualm I have, is that there is not a matching conditioner, but maybe I have overlooked it. I am excited to see results after using this product more. I am hopeful that it continues to work, and to help with any future hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer and I will definetly purchase more!!!</li>
    <li> it makes my hair super soft and i don&#x27;t need condisioner anymore and it definetly helps with shedding</li>
    <li> The best shampoo ever</li>
    <li> I basically don&#x27;t give out 5 stars, so don&#x27;t judge too quickly.  Hair Loss products are difficult things to evaluate, and with that said I can&#x27;t point to any tangible evidence that this product stopped or reduced my loss.  It does however smell/feel great to use.  It is not harsh on your hair, and it includes MANY ingredients that are (widely) considered helpful in reducing hair loss.  I would recommend the product to others and I intend to purchase it again. It is highly probable (though as I mentioned earlier not provable) that it has done my head more help than harm.  Try it out.</li>
    <li> Bought this to compare with the Gold label.  Couldn&#x27;t tell a huge difference.  However, does not leave my hair as soft as Aveda shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for many others but there is a reason why there are mixed reviews about this product. If anything, it made my hair stand up to make it look like it had more volume but it will not grow additional hairs. It&#x27;s a &#x27;whatever&#x27; product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really dries out your hair.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. I see result little by little. My hair stop falling out less than a week ago. This shampoo help you with the grease on your hair too!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle which lasted my short hair nearly 10months.  It really does work well.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!!  I have been using for few months. I noticed new hair growing in very soon after I started using.  My hair has been thinning for approximately 20 years.  This is the first product that has made a difference.  I may try the gold label soon but for now I will stick with this since less expensive and it works!</li>
    <li> This product smells great, feels smooth and a little goes a long way. Pura d&#x27;or accomplishes exactly what it states. Prevents hair loss. I have thin hair(male) and a receding hair line. Have not noticed any change or hair falling out in the shower. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any new hair growth or improvement to hair quality since I began using this product 2 months ago.  Perhaps my type of hair loss doesn&#x27;t benefit from this type of product.</li>
    <li> Leaves a very clean feeling, although I don&#x27;t know if it helped in preventing any hair loss. I feel like my hair is just as thin as before with no noticeable improvement. That said, perhaps I would have lost even more hair if I didn&#x27;t use it so I could be overly harsh. I am going to try the more expensive gold label next.</li>
    <li> I switched to the Gold Label product which really helped with my dandruff. So far I am getting good results.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses this her hair was dry and brittle after use with this it is silky and smooth with preventing hair loss seems to be working as well I don&#x27;t have to pull huge chunks of hair from the drain any more before I shower. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Okay now let me say that if you are a older gentleman like myself and are tired of the way that your hair looks, then why not try this product, right? Well first you probably won&#x27;t see results within a couple of weeks with this, but make sure when you use it, you have to massage the shampoo into your scalp thoroughly and then afterwards you must brush your head (scalp) then wait a few weeks then you will see a little bit of growth, but when i used it i didn&#x27;t like the fact my hair still looked kind of thin, i would only recommend this for those who want a little bit of hair growth.</li>
    <li> I had a great experience with this brand, As I bought Pura D&#x27;or Pure and Organic Argan Oil like 5 months ago. It worked great with my hair as well as my daughters hair too. This what encourage me to try other products from the same brand. So I gave this product a try and it really work great with my hair. I use a very small portion of the shampoo although I have a long hair and It lather very well and it rinse off easily with no residue in my hair, no greasy look in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see much difference in my first 3 times I tried it. But after this I noticed the difference, it was so clear that my hair brush is almost free of hair after I use it, very few hair strings are there. I was losing a lot before that. My hair looks better and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am using the Pura D&#x27;or  shampoo then after I brush my hair I use the Pura D&#x27;or Pure and Organic Argan Oil, and I get a great result from combining both products. I will keep using them because they work great for me.</li>
    <li> Very wonderful product and will buy from him once again</li>
    <li> This product really works! I use to lose a lot of hair but with this shampoo it&#x27;s not as much as before. It does dry my hair out a little bit tho.</li>
    <li> Starting with +5 stars and take away stars for problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The pump was broken, but that&#x27;s not a big deal if the product works. This is not a good sign. (neutral)&lt;br /&gt;2) My hair is a bit dry and frizzy after using it. (neutral, but I suspect that&#x27;s bad)&lt;br /&gt;3) It does clean my hair. A cheap bottle of Head N Shoulders can do the same thing though.&lt;br /&gt;3) It doesn&#x27;t seem to work for the primary purposes of reducing hair loss. My hair loss is the same by inspecting the amount of hair in my catch drain in the tub. (-3 stars, but it does clean hair so I&#x27;ll leave it with +2 stars)&lt;br /&gt;4) There seems to be an effort to manipulate the reviews on Amazon with the &amp;#34;not helpful votes&amp;#34; and the 1 review 5-star reviewers.  (-10 stars) Amazon should try to make it easier and quicker to identify the 1 review folks so I can ignore their review quickly like on Yelp. Automatic &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; grade in my mind when I see this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that gives us the score of -8 stars. Avoid.</li>
    <li> The gold label worked better for me. This just stopped working. Perhaps it needs to be rotated.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Losing even more hair now. This is the second bottle I bought and I am sure the formula has been changed. The color is different, smell is different, less viscosity. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and have had terrible results. My hair even feels rougher and drier. I&#x27;ve been using this bottle for over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first bottle was great. My hair felt good and less hair loss. I have no idea why they would change the formula to something that causes damage and for a higher price. I&#x27;m pretty sure all the hair I saved during the first bottle is gone now since starting the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the only reason there are so many reviews and 5 star ones is that when you get your first bottle, if you review, you&#x27;ll get one bottle free. So take all these &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; reviews with a grain of salt.</li>
    <li> I like it. I feel like it does cut down on my daily hair loss A LITTLE BIT, especially if I massage it into my scalp and let it sit in there for a good five minutes.</li>
    <li> love the product very much,  it really help a lot</li>
    <li> This works as a nice shampoo, but did not help with any hair loss. Have been using for 6 months and have seen no difference. I have very straight, limp hair. I think it must just depend on the hair type. I&#x27;m using it up since it&#x27;s so expensive but will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> Good ,wish good price soon</li>
    <li> This is giving decent results as it stopped my hair fall 50% after 2 months use. Now, my hair is manageable and volume has increased little..&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping to see the results getting better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now but haven&#x27;t seen a very noticeable change. My hair does seem like it has extra volume now but nothing extreme. I&#x27;m still going to continue to use in hopes it just takes a little longer to work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Shampoo for last 3 -4 weeks and I see noticeable difference in loss of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hair loss has reduced quite a bit.  I use this Shampoo with PuraDor conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my hair loss will stop completely in next few weeks. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product.  I have always had straight hair and this definitely adds a nice texture to my hair making it feel thicker.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo religiously for 3 weeks. My hair fell out even more in handfuls. I tried to stick with it thinking my head just had to get used to it but it got worse and worse. And the drying and itching of my scalp was terrible. The only positive is that it is all natural. So disappointed! Biggest waste of $25!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I bought it because I researched a lot and I saw the reviews in Amazon, and definitely they&#x27;re right.&lt;br /&gt;My hair becomes greasy after I used a hair straightener treatment and I had hair loss, so after use this product I feel that my hair is cleaner, not greasy and my hair loss had decreased a lot. I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> my hairdresser put her hands in my hair and said, \\&quot;it&#x27;s a different head of hair\\&quot;  and she also said, \\&quot;i didn&#x27;t realize how much you had lost until it started coming back\\&quot;.  my hair began falling out in giant clumps about two years ago.  having had very thick hair, i lost almost 2/3 of my total hair, there were little ghost hairs in the front by my once rapidly receding hairline. i am now back to half my previous volume, the hair loss has gone from scary sized clumps to a regular amount of hair and that receding hairline is now doing the opposite of receding, whatever that is.  i&#x27;ve tried of a variety of regimens, vitamins, supplements and other hair loss shampoos.  and nothing worked.  until i happened on the combination that is working very very well for me now (see hairdresser comments above). it is 5% rogaine and the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo.  those little ghost hairs in the front are becoming proper hairs again.  my hair is growing back!</li>
    <li> Not feel smooth when you finish washing, but the hair looks good in sunshine. I will continue to buy it to see how does it help with my less hair.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using it for a month and noticed no additional hair loss.  I don&#x27;t know that any new hair is growing, but he has enjoyed the shampoo, thinking it has more of the feel of a normal shampoo without all the chemicals.  With other natural shampoos, he has had no lather, or it doesn&#x27;t feel like his hair is clean, or it makes it hard to manage after he dries it.  I used it on my very long hair and enjoyed it as well.  I do not have any hair loss, so I didn&#x27;t want to use it up, but I&#x27;m often tempted to use it since it makes my hair feel so clean and soft!</li>
    <li> Great clean smell. I have noticed not as many hairs are falling out of my head since using this product. Has natural ingredients and not all of the harsh chemicals regular shampoos have.</li>
    <li> I have yet to try it but I bought it because this is a type of shampoo that I was looking for. I hope that it will be good and that it works. When I got it in the mail, some had leaked from the bottle, so I hope that does not happen again.</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo. I was recommended by a friend and I feel it increases the thickness of the hair. Value for money.</li>
    <li> Bought this with the golden label one. So far they work quite well for cleaning and adding some volume to my thinning hair. Will stic to them  for at lease 6 months to see if they work.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t have all the harsh chemicals that other shampoos have and makes my hair feel good. I don&#x27;t know if it will slow hair loss, but its worth trying. I don&#x27;t know if this is a 100% organic shampoo. That&#x27;s the only thing that could justify the exorbitant price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this about three times now and have definitely noticed less hair falling. Will definitely keep using to see the full results!</li>
    <li> it requires patience.. don&#x27;t stop using it and the results will show . it does your hair look fuller and less dry .</li>
    <li> This shampoo is not for me. It was very drying.</li>
    <li> My wife has been telling me that ever since I started using this shampoo my hair looks thicker and healthier! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Doubt this stuff actually stops hair loss but hair feels and looks good after use.  Helps thicken hair for better coverage.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s hairline is starting to recede and it really seems like this shampoo is helping to prevent the hair loss from getting worse. It smells great and I love the pump handle. I love that it is all natural too!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. I feel clean all day with this product. I would like to try the gold one eventually...but it&#x27;s damn expensive!! So, I hope they lower the price.</li>
    <li> I am using this shampoo for some days.  For more than two months, I was losing a tremendous number of hair each day.  I don&#x27;t know why I was losing hair, may be it was a seasonal hair fall or due to using Head&amp;Shoulders two-in-one (shampoo and conditioner).  I searched online for the solution and finally I came across a couple of websites both of which had graded the shampoo as the #1 solution for hair fall.  The first time I washed my hair with it, I felt the difference but my hair kept falling.  The second time, I further noticed the difference as the hair fall tremendously decreased.  After shampooing my hair with it for the 3rd time, my hair fall almost stopped.  It may be a bit early to come to a conclusion but it is how I feel about it at the moment.  I will further write about it once I use the product for a longer period of time.  And ya, the product smells fine and I found my hair healthier than before after using it.</li>
    <li> It smells good that is the best part about it. Its not like the other similar products by different brands that have a very strong smell. So far seems like it is working fine and no complaints.</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd bottle.  The 16 oz bottle lasted me about 4 months.  I have observed a considerable decrease of hair falling out in the shower and when I towel dry my hair.  My scalp feels quite clean too.  I was hoping that this product would encourage hair regrowth, haven&#x27;t observed that yet, but I am only on it for 4 months.  We&#x27;ll see after a few more months after my 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> really nice smelling and leaves the hair nicely clean with not buildups</li>
    <li> Very much like the product. . I am not totally sure it is working but I feel like I&#x27;m losing less hair in the shower, or on my comb..</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo!  Doesn&#x27;t weigh fine hair down and makes it feel thicker. Have tried EVERYTHING, and this is by far the the best. A little goes along way too.</li>
    <li> Male, Age 24,&lt;br /&gt;Hair category: brittle, scalp, dandruff. hair loss&lt;br /&gt;If I wear any black or white suit or shirt, I can see my fallen hairs on my shoulder every times, and it was so irritating for me. So,I was looking to fix my hair problem from last 2 months, and I was viewing every single product that helps me to overcome from this hair damage. Finally, I viewed this product information, and I ordered to see how this works. This shampoo has all the natural active ingredients which are more powerful than any other chemical ingredients. Within 4 weeks I got the results and the result was positive, YES..!! My hairs were shiny and smooth ,too.!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use this shampoo at least twice or thrice in week. Moreover, it smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Our hairs are very tiny, so based on that we need the soft shampoo, not the harder one who breaks more hairs. This shampoo is too soft and I can control my hair loss up to 20-25% within this 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The best way to test your hair loss is to: pick the bunch of your hairs around 20-30 and stretch it, if you find 5-6 or more hairs on your hand,it will show that you are loosing your hair and the same thing I did, but I tested after using this shampoo and I just got 1-2 hairs on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo also controls the dandruff and scalp treatment. Actually, I ordered this shampoo for my self, now my parents also fall in love with this shampoo because it helps them, too.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo to everyone.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and lathers well, but I&#x27;ve not seen a difference in the amount of hair loss.  For the money, I&#x27;d really expected a bit more.  I&#x27;ll be switching back to Aveda.</li>
    <li> Look no further for fancy shampoos...this is all you need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-leaves hair feeling clean&lt;br /&gt;-light weight&lt;br /&gt;-all natural, no harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;-easy to lather and rinse&lt;br /&gt;-a lot goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;-wife and I both use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-price</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I&#x27;ve gotten great results. My hair loss has come to a stop while using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> So far i am loving this product. I have used it for  every day. I have noticed not as much hair loss. Must use conditioner too.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  My hair feels great and stays feeling great much longer than with other brands.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great smell and leaves my hair feeling wonderful without the greasy after-the-fact.  Also makes the scalp feel really revitalized.&lt;br /&gt;Will have to see if the hair loss slows down or stops......I sure hope so.  Would certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  After about a few days of use, I have noticed less hair fall-out.  I might have to add the conditioner as well to get the full effect.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles, I just want hair loss and thinning to stop.    --UPDATE--     Nearing 3x weeks of use and I am definitely seeing less hair loss, though it has not stopped.  Where I had 6-8 hairs in my hands while showering, it seems like I am down to only 1 or 2 now.  I am also taking vitamins and will probably get the conditioner to see if that will help as well.</li>
    <li> This is one of best product ever I have used. Hair become thick, nice fragrance, stopped hair fall. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for: An all natural, relatively inexpensive (given use frequency and thickness) hair loss prevention shampoo. I have yet to see any hair grow back, but that will likely take several months if at all. The main think I&#x27;ve noticed is the stopping of the hairloss, which is all I can ask for.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  I liked that it was organic and also supports volume and growth.  After using it for about a week i could tell a noticeable difference in my hair vs the other voluminous shampoo I used previously .  This is my second buy of this product and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My first time using the shampoo and I must say I&#x27;m impressed.  I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times but I have noticed a difference in how my hair and scalp feels.  It smells great too.  Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo, and I believe it is working at thickening my hair.</li>
    <li> My friend gave the bottle to me and told me to try it after hearing my complaint about hair loss. I can see my hair no longer falls a lot like before after several trials. So, I decided to buy some more. It is rather expensive, but it worth</li>
    <li> We bought this based on someones recommendation and the stuff seems to be good. We do like the shampoo and it gives a really clean feel after the wash. I have just used it for less than a month so still cannot update on the har loss prevention part of it but will update once I get through with using the product for 2-3 months - hoping for the best!. I ahve noticed specially in &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products&#x27; based shampoo that the lather quality is not good so you end up having to use a lot of it but this one was different.. I had no problems with getting lather or with any sort of obnoxious smell</li>
    <li> Used it for almost two weeks now everyday, like the product so far...mild scent, very soft but missing that fluffy hair feel after the shower and I think that&#x27;s because of those missing harsh chemicals but not sure...hopefully this will work as it says for hair loss prevention in the long run</li>
    <li> worked for me it could work for you</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it is really helping to prevent my hair loss, but it does seem to be less, and I have only been using it for a couple of weeks. I like the way my hair feels and the way it shines. I have naturally gray hair, so keeping it from looking dull and discolored is important to me ... not to mention the thinning!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. It leaves my hair feeling great. I have seen a difference as my hair feels thicker. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not.  I still lose hairs every time I wash my hairs. It seems to slow it down but I need more time to confirm.</li>
    <li> I feel like less hair falls out during the times I use this product compared to when I stop using it for a while. I also saw a lot more baby hairs growing while I was using it!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for a little over a week now and my hair feels very soft... I may be imagining but I thing it is also making my hair hair fuller. Overall, love the shampoo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for hair loss and have found this shampoo to be effective without making my hair limp and sticky. So far so good...I think there are less hairs in my drain ;)</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a few days and already see a difference in shedding. Apart from that, the hair also just looks healthier and has better volume. Will order it again!</li>
    <li> Shampoo seems to be working very well. Nice smell and a little bit of the shampoo goes a long way! Make sure to leave the shampoo in for a few minutes before you rinse so that your scalp can absorb everything it has to offer.</li>
    <li> Just started using it not too bad so far i like it leaves a good smell...not too many notices of hair growth but i believe its gradualy working in. But so far so good I must admit</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair very soft and clean. So far I am pleased with the product. It has a pleasant smell and it  seems that I am losing less hair .</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I feel like my hair was stronger when I was using it so I just went back to it. And it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It is normal to experience hair loss as one ages...I get it. But as a woman, it was still disconcerting to always find hair in the sink, on my clothes, and in my hands if I ran my fingers through my hair.  I read the other reviews for Pura d&#x27;Or shampoo, and decided to try it.  It took awhile. I am now on my second bottle, and the hair loss has definitely slowed down...not gone completely...but I am pleased with the results. The price may seem expensive...but it&#x27;s a lot less than a trip to the doctor&#x27;s office!</li>
    <li> My wife was losing lots of hair every day. Even when she was sleeping she was losing hair. She was very worried and one day I saw a friend of mine using this shampoo, he recommended me to buy Pura Dor Shampoo and Conditioner. Therefore I bought it and we can see the difference even in first week of using this shampoo and conditioner. Therefore I recommend this shampoo if you are having hair loss.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the feel it leaves my hair after using it. Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects on my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for those noticing their hair thinning. A coworker used for one wk and saw a noticable difference. So I tried it and had the same wonderful.experience.  Less hair coming out, scalp less noticable; my hair looks healthly! I have been complimented on how soft my hair is and even my hair stylist noticed!  So glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this from AMAZON and waited in order to shampoo my hair for a couple of weeks in order to make a review.  I haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth yet because is too soon, but I did noticed that less hair is fallen every time I washed it.  So that&#x27;s give me a hope and I will continue using it since perseverance is the magic word when it comes to hair loss.  Along with the PURA D&#x27;OR  shampoo I used Biotin and Minoxidil 2% on a regular basis.  Did not like the smell at all, but since it is organic that does not bother me.</li>
    <li> Just received this product and used it twice now.  I noticed right from the first shampoo my hair already looked liked it had more volume and my usually sensitive scalp was not irritated like when using shampoo with harsh chemicals in them. My hair is also very more manageable and very silky.  Most importantly I was looking for a shampoo that would help my hair from breaking so much since I have very long hair.  Also, very impresses with results, the breakage has gone down to less then half!!  Very happy with this product so far!</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo for three days i noticed that less hair fell out during and after the shower. It felt softer and fuller after drying the hair. I also love how it keeps my hair moist, not greasy. I&#x27;m planning on using this shampoo from now on and purchase the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> It seems to work very well.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I found this stuff looking for solutions to hair loss, it got rave reviews and kudos. It makes bold claims to prevent hair loss. so I thought i&#x27;d give it a try.I&#x27;ve used it for 3-4 months religiously.. I havent seen any noticeable results in hair loss judging by the amount that comes off during shampooing,... After using this stuff with NO result.. I can HIGHLY recommend DS laboratories products,.. specifically DNC topical treatment in combination with REVITA shampoo,.. neither one is cheap,.. but they DO work, and you see results in as little as 2 weeks. My advice would be don&#x27;t purchase this shampoo and spend your money on more effective ingredients and dont listen to the favorable reviews that get you a free bottle of shampoo... I reviewed this products a while ago and was rewarded with a free bottle of this stuff,.... and now I have a new paperweight.  :/[[ASIN:B005LNMHZM DS Laboratories Revita Growth Stimulating Shampoo 6 oz &amp; Conditioner 6oz Duo Set]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and also[[ASIN:B00Q3FL712 DS Laboratories, Spectral·DNC-N, Hair Support System, 2 fl oz (60 ml)]]</li>
    <li> It smells good, it seens to work after 5 days. Keep using it and see if get any better.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to purchase any type of shampoo for hairloss etc. but I find this shampoo works great with my hair strength and thickness. I dont see any re-growth as I am in the early stages of using it but over all I am very pleased with the Shampoo. I only use one squirt of it (amount the size of a quarter) and it spreads out evenly throughout my whole head. Going to have this bottle for a long time !</li>
    <li> I really like this product, a bottle lasts a  long time.  I am not losing as much hair as I was, and am now brushing my hair without the brush filling up with hair, will reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 2 years now. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the other big brands, but I keep coming back to this one.  The price and quality make it an excellent buy.  I&#x27;ve only tried one shampoo that I liked better than this one, but it was twice as expensive.  It might not make you grow hair back, but it will keep you from losing it and make what you have look thicker.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to address hair loss I highly recommend. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and am already experiencing noticeably less hair loss. I will update after finishing my first bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year. I was skeptical at first but I have noticed significant improvement to my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my hair does look bit dull...perhaps b/c this is organic and sometimes our hair/scalp just needs good ole chemical to get risk of residues from our products..</li>
    <li> solid product. leaves hair soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> The production is good, but the all bottle covers were broken during the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lan Wang</li>
    <li> My guy turned me onto this product. I&#x27;m always very skeptic towards products that claim miracles, so I would have never tried this if it wasn&#x27;t for him. He has had a bald spot on the back of his head for as long as I have known him. I know exactly where its located on his head. One day, I was running my hands through his hair, and realized that the spot was no longer there! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. I spent the next few moments digging around his hair, trying to see if I had looked at the wrong spot. No bald spots ANYWHERE. He had only been using this product for about a month. So, I decided to try for myself. Its only been 1 week, but I have noticed less fall out myself. I am waiting for my 1 month result to be as great as his, with one spot on my head that has always been scant to fill in. I have already spread the word about this shampoo to my fellow girlfriends, as well as male workers. This product is truly a miracle worker!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo for awhile now.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not that bad despite what other reviewers have mentioned. I have noticed more volume in my hair after usage.&lt;br /&gt;It does take awhile for results to take effect as with most products. However, my hair does feel softer and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that it is an organic shampoo with no chemicals so I feel safe using it. The smell of the shampoo is actually rather calming. I recommend the use of conditioner after using the shampoo as there is oil involved. The conditioner helps mask the smell if you do not like it and makes the hair even softer. The shampoo is a bit pricey but does last awhile with 2-3 pumps per use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Great product suds well, seems to be making improvements in hair growth. I will update for more results.</li>
    <li> its good, it smells good. I love Biotin shampoos, they work well on me, I just started using this one. It doesn&#x27;t lather very well like any other shampoo that&#x27;s organic without lauryl sulfate. It not color safe because it has natural oils that will clear out your hair color.</li>
    <li> First of all, I like the samell of the shampoo. It refresh me every morning. I haven&#x27;t seen if it prevent hair loss, but I feel my hair become healthier. I hope my hair can become thicker and strong soon.</li>
    <li> It smells great and probably good for 2 months for just this bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this shampoo! I can totally see and feel the difference in my hair, even after the first use! My hair feels fuller and healthier. I&#x27;m also happy to see all the new growth! I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I gave up Nioxin and tried this. After using for just one week, it made both of my hair and scalp feel good.&lt;br /&gt;I also feel my hair is getting thicker.</li>
    <li> I have hair loss problem since five years ago. Every time it is a headache to clean the shower drain and my hair is always lifeless. After using Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo, I can tell that my hair is stronger and has more volume now. Obviously, there is much less hair loss during my shower, too. Great product, will buy again.</li>
    <li> The delivery is fast. I like this product. The smell is good and it is really helpful to prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> love it, smells good, and feels fresh! can&#x27;t wait to see the longterm result!</li>
    <li> I think I like it. Good smell and comfortable to use. A little bit dry after use. Less hair loss after using it for one week. I will see if it can make my hair grow faster. Anyway, a good product.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical about the reviews, but go figure, this stuff worked. I had been losing an alarming amount of hair which I attributed to stress and age. My scalp always seemed tender to touch, and my hair had been falling out for about 5 months. My very smart teenager said maybe it was my shampoo and other hair care products (even though they were sulfate free and special for curly hair) that I used to tame my long, curly, and at that time, thick hair. I ordered Pura d&#x27;or and literally with just one shampoo, the amount of hair that fell out with that shampooing was half of what it had been. I must have developed some sort of allergy or sensitivity to the other hair care products, and this is so clean and organic. By the end of the 3rd week, I am  losing very little hair with each shampoo and I can see the little hairs starting to grow back in now that my scalp has calmed down with this organic shampoo. It smells great, lathers (which most of the non sulfate shampoos don&#x27;t lather so that makes it a bit more fun) and I do leave it on my scalp about 5 minutes and massage it in well both before and after those 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing!  I was having hair loss issues due to hormonal imbalances and started using this shampoo.  After about two months of just using this shampoo, I started noticing new growth all over my head. I have tried other hair loss shampoos but this one far exceeds anything else I have tried. The ingredients are pure and it does not have any synthetic perfumes that can irritate your scalp.  If you are having hair loss issues, I would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> After almost a month of use I can definitely say I see less hair on my &amp;#34;hair trapper&amp;#34; in the shower and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I was starting to get worried about losing so much hair after each wash. I had used other shampoos to prevent hair loss and especially to promote new hair growth in the past and they didn&#x27;t work as fast and good as this one. I will definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> It lathers great and leaves my hair feeling silky and soft after showering.  I use this along with nizoral once a week and feel like it is slowing down my hair loss.  I like the ingredients and also like that it is SLS free.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as my friend&#x27;s suggestion for about a week together with the Hair, skin and nail multivitamin in Costco. As I saw in the mirror today, my hair looks kinda darker and thicker, less hair loss. For now, am very happy with the quick result. I will continue to update the improvement later in the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> Very light odor, rinse clearly, hair stays moistured after wash. Quality product!</li>
    <li> No heavy scent, can also feel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good reviews about this product. After my first time using it, I just can&#x27;t believe it really works! Now I&#x27;m using it everyday. It helps with hair loss prevention. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Although I like the list of nontoxic ingredients, the way the shampoo makes my hair feel, and the way it smells, I have not actually noticed a decrease in hair loss.  (I have been experiencing hair loss after childbirth, probably due to changing hormones, so it&#x27;s possible nothing will help.)</li>
    <li> My wife said that this product was safe and wouldn&#x27;t cause hair loss.  The price is a bit more expensive than other common hair washing products but I believe that, to keep my hair, the price is fair.</li>
    <li> used this recently and it made my hair dry and harsh.. didnt make my hair thicker at all</li>
    <li> Smells nice, lathers well, and rinses clean.  A little pricey for shampoo but hopefully it will help my hair to grow thicker.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I purchased this product a few days ago and it seems great. I have read a lot of reviews about it, all of which were mostly positive as well as thorough, and I am excited to see the results. I have been using Nioxin System 1 for some time now and have not seen any noticeable changes in my hair density. I also stumbled upon reviews about how Nioxin recently changed their ingredients and thus has not been the same or as effective since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be posting again about this product in a few months, hopefully with some good news about some noticeable results.</li>
    <li> After using it, I feel my hair condition is getting better. I will keep using it and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this for the hair loss prevention and after almost a week of using Pura d&#x27;or it seems to help.</li>
    <li> I have been highlighting my hair for years now and tried so many products to keep my hair soft,bring the shine back,and most important of all prevent our crazy hair loss...unfortunately nothing seemed to work (all products were chemical based).&lt;br /&gt;Therefore,my sister(non-dyed hair) and I decided to use an organic based shampoo as our last hope to bring life back to our hair.&lt;br /&gt;After extensive googling,we came across Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo with its conditioner that we decided to try since it was 100% organic and had good reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the third time we use this shampoo since our purchase where we noticed that:&lt;br /&gt;-our hair is absorbing the shampoo more.&lt;br /&gt;-the conditioner makes our hair softer each time we reuse it.&lt;br /&gt;-hair loss decreased(did not totally stop yet,we hope eventually it will stop with frequent use).&lt;br /&gt;-the product has a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;We really love this product till now and we hope we will get the hair we always wanted with more use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We personally do recommend this product(with PURA d&#x27;or Organic conditioner) to every person suffering from dried stiffed up lifeless hair.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so amazing!!! very useful for my hair loss. love it!!!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t regrow your hair but will stop its progress, maybe because it is organic shampoo? This is my second one. Before I use it, my hair losses bad. They were everywhere, bed pillow, restroom, sofa, cars and etc. After I use it, I realize it started better, now it almost clean on Wash basin after I comb my hair. Very good 5 star!</li>
    <li> I purchased this the first time via a groupon deal. I&#x27;m a long time alopecia aerata sufferer and have lost hair by the handful after a shower. I noticed significant improvements in the amount of hair loss when using this shampoo and this is my second bottle purchased via Amazon. I love that I only need to use a little bit as it is very concentrated and high quality. I have long hair and this bottle can last me 2 months or more!</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo.  I always stick to all natural, few ingredient products.  The ingredients are definitely high quality.  Have noticed a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Never compared to other hair loss preventing shampoo so can&#x27;t comment on comparison but as advertised, it reduces hair loss with daily use. At least compared to a regular shampoo. It has a decent scent. I like this product so far. It seems to work in the short term but will need to see if this continues in the long term.</li>
    <li> I really love using this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t leave any smell after wash off and does make the hair denser. Also, there has been significantly less hair loss ever since i started using this product. I would love to switch to or try gold label, but its too expensive. Anyways, this product seem to work fine on my hair. I use it once daily. I would definitely recommend this product to those starting undergoing hair thinning. Hopefully, you&#x27;ll have similar results as i do!</li>
    <li> I have tried many types of treatment shampoo, this one is the best so far. This organic shampoo gives very fresh feeling for oily hair and my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortably dry after use. Although whether it will help control oily scalp and prevent hair loss need a longer time to test, I still think this shampoo could improve scale health for those suffering from hear loss. A healthy diet and positive mood are necessary to grow hair back. Try it!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. I have very sensitive skin.  Ever since I have used this product, I no longer get that red itchy feeling. Plus it&#x27;s organic and smells great. Since this is my first month of use, I can&#x27;t tell if it helps with thinning hair, but I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shampoos and with this shampoo I had noticeably less hair loss. Also compared to other SLS free shampoos I have tried this one was better and gentler.&lt;br /&gt;I will defiantly buy it again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife since she had some issue with hair loss. After using this product twice, she loved it and noticed an immediate effect on reducing hair loss. I am glad that I bought this product for her to try and it works!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a natural shampoo that works for quite some time now. I have been experimenting with going &#x27;poo-less&#x27; and have tried making my own &#x27;shampoo&#x27; at home, but have not been able to find anything that works with my scalp / hair type. I have been using the Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil on my ends for several months now and love it, so I decided to give the shampoo a try as well. This shampoo is able to make my hair and scalp feel clean with all natural ingredients that I can trust, compared to chemicals used in most other shampoos. I have been using this along with a home-made conditioner and the Argan Oil for extra moisture and shine. After only 2 uses so far my hair feels good: soft, clean etc. I&#x27;m not sure about the hair loss prevention yet. I still see shedding in / after the shower, but shedding is normal. I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in the amount of hair I shed, but there is no abnormal increase in shedding either, which is a good sign. The only bad thing I have to say is that the bottle I received was chipped on the back end of the pump and I was unable to twist it open without a pair of pliers. This is more likely the fault of the vendor that I bought it from and not the product itself. Overall I really like this shampoo and will continue to use it. I would definitely recommend it to a friend, but mostly as a great natural shampoo, not so much for hair loss prevention (not yet, time will tell).</li>
    <li> after using this product for two weeks, i noticed less hair loss when i brush my hair. so far, i am satisfied with this product and will continue to use it .</li>
    <li> Great Product would buy again</li>
    <li> Product works as claimed. I have tried it for few months and have seen positive results. Since using this product I have not seen much hair loss and hair feels more full.&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinning, then definitely try this product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i use this product. The smell is really nice. It smells like some herbs and gingers but it is really a good-smell shampoo. After I clean my hair with it, the feeling is fresh and cool. I feel my hair skin is really clean. I like the smell and my hair is smooth after use the shampoo. I will keep using it and hope it can prevent my hair loss.</li>
    <li> It is awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;In my case, I have had hair loss problem...., It make me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair condition has changed after using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Actually It is not a medicine, but a lot of hair from hair loss  is totally  reduced. Especially after shower, It is esay to figure out how much my condition is improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;I think I am a big Pan for this Shampoo!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t quantitatively say that this is reducing my hair loss, but it certainly feels like it is. My hair feels thicker, I notice less hair falling out/in the drain, and a few of my friends have commented that my hair looks thicker as well. I am a fan! That being said, don&#x27;t expect a miracle product. It works as reasonably well as I could expect a hair loss prevention shampoo.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this already. great product and works very well. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Used 3 times and each time it left my hair with a residue of oil.  Hair looked lifeless and limp.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look clean and shiny, feel good to the touch, and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> The product is just as described, I&#x27;m looking forward to order more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of hairloss shampoos and the Pura d&#x27;or is one of the only shampoos that seem to actually work. Their expensive, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year, after I started having massive hair fall and intense scalp itch.  I can&#x27;t say for sure that this shampoo is what has made my hair grow back, but I definitely feel I am doing the very best thing I can to assure continued hair growth and prevent more falling, plus taking really good care of my scalp.  I have color damaged hair, and this is a rare shampoo in that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;rough up&amp;#34; my hair after rinsing out the shampoo.  This hair makes my scalp feel good-  I lather it in, massage it into my scalp, and leave it on a couple of minutes.  I swear it helps make my hair feel thicker, smells great, and feels luxurious.  Yes it is expensive, but the stuff in it is a great combination of hair-nurturing ingredients that help prevent more hair loss, without any of the scary chemical bad stuff.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I made purchase based on the review and expected to cure hair loss problem. I received the bottle and used a few times. Feels good and smells good too. It&#x27;s definitely a great shampoo.  I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness on the hair loss prevention yet.  Time will tell. I&#x27;ll update my review regarding that after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really reduces hair loss.Of course it doesn&#x27;t stop it completely. Because to stop hair loss completely you need to treat the reason of it.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my scalp feel so good. It is free of SLS and other harsh chemicals so  it is one of the rear shampoos that I can use every day.</li>
    <li> Working well for me after using it. My hair loss is better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos over the years for hair loss prevention, this has been the best. No Sulfate, with Biotin and Saw Palmetto, plus a ton more of good stuff in it.</li>
    <li> I suffered a heavy hair loss since last month, and I was worried a lot. Then, I heard of this shampoo from my friend. Now, I have been using this shampoo for almost a weeks, I feel my scalp become healthier and healthier, no more oil even after a long day work, and my hair is stronger than before. I believe my hair could be better if I keep on using it. I would recommend this to someone who has the same problem as I had on hairs.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE , IT IS WORKING</li>
    <li> Used a few time in last two weeks.  Resulting little more dandruff.  My hair didn&#x27;t get more oily nor dry.  It seems I lost LESS hair during hair washing but when combing, still lost about the same amount.  Maybe, I need to use longer time to see effect from this shampoo?  I would say, at least, so far, using this shampoo doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;m using this product and I&#x27;m impressed! I dyed my hair 2 weeks ago and needed a good shampoo ASAP. My hair feels softer and the hair loss did become less. The price speaks for its quality - I used to buy shampoos from drugstores and I do see a difference. I hope my expectations will keep up when I have finished the bottle.</li>
    <li> It is a good product,my hair feels softer and the hair loss did become less.Since I used it, my hair is better. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome. My friend recommend me to use this shampoo for preventing hair loss. And it really works!</li>
    <li> Great product. After I used this this shampoo,  I feel so comfortable.</li>
    <li> It seems to work although it is expensive. I will try more.</li>
    <li> Just received this product  hope it works :))))))</li>
    <li> This order is for my wife. She likes it and feels good with it.</li>
    <li> Just start to use this, wish it is good.</li>
    <li> I think it is pretty good, this is my first bottle so the result may not be so obvious, I am going to keep on trying.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and sent on time.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for months and he and I have noticed a difference in his hair - it feels and looks thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo to those whose hair is thinning.</li>
    <li> this is very good shampoo. I very like it.</li>
    <li> Scent is good, satisfied with the product so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using if for a couple of week and haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in shedding, but I do like how clean this shampoo make my scalp feel. definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been losing good amount of hair and was seeking a good anti hair loss shampoo and I found it on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;All the reviews were good so I decided to give it a try. The moment I put one pump on my hair, I can feel very soft and good lather on my hair. It works really well and I can see the improvement. I would totally recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Unlike some other organic shampoo I used before, this shampoo does give a lot of soap when I use it.  I feel my hair clean and smooth after use.  I have dry and colored hair.  I often feel itchy after some other shampoo, but not with this one.  I&#x27;m not sure if it will stop hair loss.  I have hair loss still.  Maybe I need to use it for a while to see this result.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle now and I love this product.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you just have to use a little bit each time. You will definitely notice healthier hair after a few tries.</li>
    <li> I bought this Oil after seeing lot of positive reviews on hairfall  control. Was bit sceptic initially and thought, lets give a try. After few weeks of use, this Shampoo has reduced the hairfall quite a bit. It didn&#x27;t reduce hair loss completely, but reduced considerably. I think, since my expectations were low and even considerable hair loss control is good for me. Satisfied with the product. I used other hair fall control shampoos, but this is much better among them except for the price :-).</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about whether or not this shampoo would help my thinning hair, but ever since I started using it, my hair has gotten thicker.  There is definitely less hair laying in the shower drain than there used to be, sometimes none at all.  I have been using it continuously for 10 months now and just bought my second bottle of it.  I use it in combination with taking vitamins and other dietary supplements so I don&#x27;t know if it is the shampoo alone or the supplements alone or the combination of everything that is doing the job.</li>
    <li> Very good product!.  It DOES work!  Starting using one month ago. Keep using this for the future</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Great smell, lathers up nicely, and leaves hair feeling thicker. I will have to write another review after I completely use the first bottle to say for sure if hair loss has subsided.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and use it every time. It smells good and makes my hair feel good. I don&#x27;t know if it will slow hair loss, but its worth trying as its a nice shampoo.</li>
    <li> It does work. There are less hair left in the tub after 2 weeks use of it. Smells natural and my wife like the scent. My hair becomes smooth. Not bad, will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Great product so far, I absolutely love how it moisturizes the scalp and leaves me feeling great after each and every wash. I bought this product mainly because i noticed some thinning in my hair, but right now its too early to tell if it will help with hair regrowth. But I still feel like its worth the price. I would definitely give it a try!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my first time to try such kind of shampoo,hope it work well</li>
    <li> The shampoo feels refreshing on my head and I love the scent! I&#x27;d have tso far so good. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t as expensive as it cost double the price of the other high end shampoos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many shampoos over the years that claim they prevent hair loss. Nothing worked, but this one did. I&#x27;ve noticed I now have a lot more thicker hair with volume. The shampoo smells great and also feels great to use in the shower. It lathers up well and deep cleans my hair. I definitely recommend this product to anyone with signs of hair loss!</li>
    <li> This stuff will slow down your hair loss.  It&#x27;s definitely formulated for men because it doesn&#x27;t smell too pretty.  I like it and I buy it again.</li>
    <li> very mild. good for daily use. I use it with massage on scalp and I feel my hair get stronger and thicker. Definitely worth to try a bottle of organic shampoo...</li>
    <li> EASY TO USE. CHANGE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF HAIR RAPIDLY.MOISURE. SUITABLE FOR ALL TYPE OF HAIR.</li>
    <li> I really really like this shampoo and plan to consider using it.  It seems to have stimulated some growth, and reduced the amount that is falling out. Although it&#x27;s hard to tell how much as I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week.  My husband has been stealing it too!</li>
    <li> Simply put, the claim on the bottle that &amp;#34;continued use will prevent further hair loss&amp;#34; did not hold true for me.  I&#x27;ve used this religiously everyday for 5 months, and my hairline has continued to recede.  Granted, it may take more time, but it would seem that 5 months would be enough to inhibit further hair loss, if indeed this shampoo will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this shampoo is specifically for hair loss, I think that should be the main factor of my review.  Using this perspective, I would&#x27;ve given it only 1 star, but it does smell nice, has a nice consistency, cleans my hair, and has healthy ingredients -- so, that warrants an additional star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my experience changes, I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy pursuit of your hairline.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 3 weeks so far. While I see a small improvement on the thickness of my hair, I would like to give it more time to believe it really works. From the hair quality perspective, it feels a great product immediately after the first time application. The hair became stronger, more energetic, and brighter. Would like to keep using it to see a significant improvement.</li>
    <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;Just received the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Lathers extremely well, and has a nice lemon minty smell. Cant wait to see the full results!</li>
    <li> First of all the shampoo smells really good. It has rich foam and it leaves your hair soft. The only issue I had was that my scalp felt a little dry after using this shampoo. Other than that its a great find for me.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is good to fight against hair loss.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t worth it buying bought this for a family member and he told me there has been no gain in hair growth, it&#x27;s already in the trash.</li>
    <li> Currently this is one of my favorite shampoo among all brands I used. My hair is thin and was falling out abnormally fast when I was using just a grocery store brand. I saw this deal and this try does not disappointed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I did not like it caz the smell is not good as other brands which have flower/fruits flavors. And, after I used it, problems came like dandruff, dry, itchy scalp bothered me much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I did not give up. After two or three months later, it did work for me. Only little hair fall down after taking shower and it looks much thicker and healthier now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problems as I have at the beginning, I could give you a suggestion. I found the best way is to combine two shampoos together. I am using Pura and another one which contains ginger to solve the problems like dandruff, dry, and itchy scalp. Or you could use a conditioner which contains tea tree or something you think will be useful.</li>
    <li> It hardens your hair and makes it seem like your hair is thicker.</li>
    <li> I love this product but I did not give it a 5 star because it does not smell good.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is terrific.  Makes my hair feel healthy.  I am a 26 year old male and have had thin hair my whole life.  This shampoo is a nice first step for me, in my (hopefully) life long pursuit of maintaining a healthy head of hair.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I just dyed my hair 2 weeks ago. It was a very bright red.  I just used this shampoo today and I am SO UPSET! I knew I was screwed when the bottom of my shower was as red as it was the day I dyed my hair and rinsed out the dye. I quickly rinsed out the shampoo, which doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all by the way, and conditioned and rinsed. I dried my hair only to see that my bright red hair is now a dull brownish red. I am beyond mad. You can see from my photo on the left, a zoomed in picture taken a couple days ago and the one on the right is one I just took. It went from bright and shiny to full and darker with 1 wash.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day for almost 3 months.  I don&#x27;t see any visible result...except that my hair is heavier and lays flat.  Still hopeful that its doing something...</li>
    <li> Great product and works well. Definitely saw an improvement with hair loss and would continuing using again</li>
    <li> Had somewhat high expectation from this product, however, it fell short! My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean after using this product, it sticks in the hair and doesnt come off!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! After just one use I could tell a BIG difference in my hair! Not only was my hair clean using very little of the shampoo but my hair loss was half of what it was before! I won&#x27;t use anything else but this and have been telling this to my friends who have similar hair loss problems. Especially nice that it takes just a small squirt to get my hair clean (I wash my hair every two or three days). Also my hair looks better, has more volume and seems to stay clean longer. My hair is naturally fine and I can tell immediately if a shampoo will help it or not. I am also 65 years old, another plus for this product that does such an amazing job.</li>
    <li> I have been using other natural products for my thining hair and nothing has worked as well as this did. Some users complain about the smell but it&#x27;s not bad at all but I don&#x27;t care for fruity smelling hair. I have seen a lot of new growth and it feels thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the advice from another review and I really work it into the scalp, massaging it throughly and then just leave it on while I continue my shower 8 - 10 mins max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great deal, my wife mentioned that the bottle would not last as long for a woman but for a guy it can certainly last you 3 months.</li>
    <li> My opinion of this product is that it was designed not to do what it says, but to instead sell you hopes of what you want to believe it can do. I have been using this product for about a month hoping to see some difference but there is none. Hope people find this information useful &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; they purchase. I sure wished I had.</li>
    <li> I have been using htis for about 2 months.  I think it makes my hair mor managable and I also feel I likle it because of all the organic ingredients.  Not harsh chemicals.  So I would appreciate you sending me another bottle to use.&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review with, I&#x27;ve been having lots of shedding for the past year, I think due to stress since I&#x27;m only in my late 20s, and the thinning is starting to show.  I decided to purchase this product from Groupon since they had the shampoo for half off, and I ended up getting two bottles.  I have only been using this product for about 2 weeks, and I can&#x27;t believe the difference it has made in my hair.  I shampoo my hair with the product every other day or at most every two days, and condition with Aveda shampure conditioner.  After I get out of the shower, I spray my hair with bumble and bumble hair thickening spray and then blow dry my hair.  My hair turns out beautifully, and using this product is the only difference I&#x27;ve made in my hair routine.  There is noticeably more volume and my hair appears thicker.  I think it&#x27;s too early to tell if it has or will regrow hair, but I love the way my hair has been turning out so I will continue to use this shampoo and update my results in a few months.</li>
    <li> Not much of a difference. If you have thin hair like me..your hair just feels greasy</li>
    <li> leaves hair a bit dry but otherwise works great!</li>
    <li> after reading comments..i purchased product..after a few washes..less and less hair loss was very obvious, i continued to use all of this product and i would give it 10 stars..i am so glad i found this product, be patient..it works...the SELLER said it will send me a complimentary bottle for writing a review..thumbs up all around.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it has brought back any lost hair, but it has absolutely kept the hair on my head.</li>
    <li> I am not sure it&#x27;s gentle on the hair, but after using it for a few weeks now, I can definitely say that it made my hair thicker and heavier. I have no issues with &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34; hair, but rather with thin hair, which required me to add lots of product to add weight. I am using little other product now, and my hair feels more manageable and thicker since I started to use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 2 weeks now and I have seen a significance difference! My hair feels thicker and my shedding as reduced by over 50%. It&#x27;s amazing!! I&#x27;m so happy because I didn&#x27;t want to start using Rogaine. I hope it continues to work. I also like its combo of natural ingredients (the DHT blocker ingredient are good). My only complaint is, it&#x27;s a little drying for me. I definitely need to use conditioner with it, I just have been using my personal fav with it and it seems to still do the job. Overall I&#x27;m really happy, maybe I&#x27;ll grow my hair out again. Thanks Pura d&#x27;or!!</li>
    <li> Product is OK but its not a hair loss shampoo with ketoconazole like regenepure or spectral DNC.  Its not bad but it will not encourage hair growth</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this shampoo!! I use it to prevent hair loss that occurs naturally with aging.  The formula keeps your scalp invigorated and is super clarifying while being super gentle on the hair.  I have long, color treated hair and it&#x27;s been lustrous and shiny since I started using this shampoo 6 months ago.  Will always keep this one in my shower!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if it will help me with my hair thinning yet but it sure leaves my scalp clean and feeling great. The hair is much more manageable too!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! My hair is so shiny and soft, it only feels like this usually when I leave the salon. But with this shampoo, i feel like I leave the salon everyday. Im inlove with pura d&#x27;or!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well. I have only been using it about 3 weeks and I have seen new hair growth and no further hair loss.</li>
    <li> Honestly it’s hard for me to give a good or bad review. I read some reviews about the bottle leaking upon shipment. I had no problems with the bottle that amazon sent me. It was very well packaged with the top of the bottle wrapped up. I have been using the shampoo for about 3 weeks now. I have noticed a change in the amount of hair in my brush at the end of the week. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as much and the breakage I was having before isn&#x27;t as much either. I have a dandruff prone scalp and very sensitive skin and I haven’t had any dandruff or any changes in my skin when using this product. I don’t have a problem in the smell of the shampoo. The only negative thing I have thus far is when I curl my hair or use the flat iron my hair gives off a smell that something is burning off of my hair. I think it might be a residue that it leaves on my hair that is burning off. But I think that kind of the point of the product it has to leave something on your hair to strengthen it. I don’t think it makes my hair smell bad it just make the room smell bad. I do believe that everything takes time so it’s going to take some time for me to notice any real changes. So I will post an update in 6 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this shampoo for over 5 months now and haven&#x27;t seen any results. Good smelling shampoo though, but did not help to improve hair loss (hard to tell as I had an already healthy set of hair before using) . Also, it&#x27;s way too expensive for just a shampoo, even an organic one. I&#x27;ll look elsewhere next time.</li>
    <li> It is good and prevent my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I noticed that my hair fall stopped with in 2 uses, really love this product. worth trying whoever experiences hair fall!!</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo. It took about 6 months for my hair to quit falling out but now it has and I probably will always use it.</li>
    <li> Feels hair feeling clean. Just started using it so I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.</li>
    <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for me. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in the amount of hair I have been loosing. I just finished my first bottle and bought another one hoping that with longer consistency I might see some improvement.</li>
    <li> The product worked well for my fine thin hair. The shampoo gave my hair needed  body. I noticed less hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month and really enjoy it. My hair isn&#x27;t shedding as much, it smells amazing, feels amazing, and helps my hair to grow and look fuller. I really appreciate it, as does my girlfriend.</li>
    <li> As a guy I was very suspicious of using a special hair product, but due to thinning hair and desire to use all natural products I decided to give it a try. I must say this product has been fantastic and my hair loss has honestly stopped and my hair absolutely is thicker. I have been using Purador for 1 year now and will never go back! Thank you for such a great product at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27; know whether it works for preventing hair loss or not, but my hair feels awful after washing it with this product. It doesn&#x27;t look clean and doesn&#x27;t feel smooth at all.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Pura.  I really like the way my feels.  I noticed that I have very little hair loss when I am shampooing.  I usually have a handful of hair that I pull from the drain.  My hair is much more manageable than it used to be.  I have very fine hair and it seemed to be thinning in different places.  My hair seems to be much fluffier than it was a year ago.  I continue to use Pura d&#x27;or as long as I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has some hair loss.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t see any improvement of my skin or hair after using it for over a month.</li>
    <li> I use this company&#x27;s Argan Oil to condition my hair, so when I saw a Groupon for this product at a major discount I decided to give it a try. I have a very high stress job, coarse curly hair and dealt with a lion&#x27;s mane of hair when I was younger. The problem was always that my hair was too big. But over the past few years I realized my hair was falling out far more than it should. I have to be honest and say I have only used this for a week, but whether it&#x27;s placebo effect or not, I swear less hair comes out when I wash my hair. I haven&#x27;t had issues with dry scalp, but it&#x27;s early yet. I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it hasn&#x27;t been long enough for me to write a crazy glowing endorsement of the product. However my experience with their argan oil and this has made me a believer.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and I am suffering the hair loss. I love this shampoo not only because it improves my hair loss scenario but also the feel after washing my hair. You don&#x27;t even need the conditioner after this shampoo because it is organic and natural, without strong cleanser. I just bought a gold label one and cannot wait to have a try.</li>
    <li> After using it a couple of time, I must say that i actually do feel my hair has become thicker. Not thick like a bush! But thicker than it used to be. Will continue to use and give it a five stars after I have finished the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think after the first use but as I continued to use it, I noticed my hair felt not only fuller but it felt stronger as well.  This product appears to live up to its claims.  I&#x27;m please and will cocntinue to use it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (&amp; the Pura d&#x27;or conditioner) for just over a year now &amp; it seems like the thinness I was experiencing has stopped, or at least slowed down drastically. I almost NEVER see hair in the shower drain anymore. I will continue to use these products!</li>
    <li> I started using Pura d&#x27;or shampoo 6 weeks ago along with Extra Strength Romaine which I have been using for 20 years.  So far, so good. I like what it does for my hair.  Makes it easily manageable and although it may have a tendency to dry my hair, the fact that I have oily skin does not affect me.  I like the ingredients and while I am unsure as to whether or not it will grow new hair, the fact that it helps keep what I have without any falling out.  Bear in mind that I am 80-years old with a decent head of hair because I have always watched what I put in it, therefore, I can say that this product works for me.  I am old enough to know that for every positive remark, there will be someone with negative comments.  Consequently, it is all a matter of perception and I perceive that it works for me.   I will continue to replenish my supply until something proven better arrives.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks now. Got it as a groupon deal. I was skeptical at first and thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt anything since it&#x27;s natural. I still have hair loss when washing my hair, but I noticed it feels thicker when I grab all my hair in one hand. I don&#x27;t think this is the placebo effect because I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this shampoo (since other hair loss shampoos make similar claims, but don&#x27;t really work). I&#x27;ll continue to use it and may even buy another bottle once this one runs out. I figure it&#x27;s not hurting anything.</li>
    <li> I can tell this is a good product with good ingredients and no bad ones. does it regrow hair? doubtful. does it help? it probably does for those folks that have too much product in their hair/scalp and need to clear out the pores.</li>
    <li> I waited about months before posting this review as I believe a product like this takes time to see and feel genuine results.&lt;br /&gt;Will it restore your hair and grow it back? I doubt it!&lt;br /&gt;Will it keep it feeling thicker and healthier and potentially halt or slow down the balding process? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks and feels incredible with this shampoo which I use in conjunction with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it and will continue to use it well after this review is submitted.</li>
    <li> Noticed my hair thinning problem few months back when I see the amount of hairs on mine pillow in the morning and i decided to try this product after doing some research on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;Had been using this product for three months and my experience is that, this product wouldn&#x27;t help you to regrow your hairs back. But, it definitely  reduce the hair loss. A product I would continue using</li>
    <li> The main reason I tried this product is because lately I have been losing hair. I cannot say I saw a dramatic change in the amount of hair I lose since I started using it (I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle), but I suspect DC water might be to blame for that rather than the shampoo. It leaves my hair healthy and shining and I can feel there are no harmful chemicals in it- unlike the mainstream shampoos.</li>
    <li> This product lasted me 1 year the pump delivers exactly what you need for short hair LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I purchased it on GROUPON to try it and after only 2 weeks I LOVE IT!  Noticed a difference after only a few days.  Less hair coming out anywhere and for the first time ever I can go a day without washing my hair!  I just condition my ends because it does dry it out a bit.  Smells nice and makes my hair look even healthier.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This is awesome shampoo. I have been having hair loss for two years on and off, but constantly for the last nine months. I tried both Inositol (worked for a short time) and Biotin (did not work at all).  Within a week of using this shampoo hair loss had almost stopped. Within three weeks I was no longer losing any hair. It also smells wonderful and is free of chemicals. It is expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year and a half, and while I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve seen hair really grow over the course of those two years, I have noticed that this shampoo excels in the preventative respect. I love that it is safe to use everyday and it is definitely not harsh on your hair. There aren&#x27;t really any negative side effects other than it may leave your scalp a little oily the next day but that isn&#x27;t such a surprise since it is made with argan oil. I do really like this product and I do not see myself using any other shampoo. I have tried other hair loss shampoos and this one has been the best so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other products by Pura d&#x27;Or and they were great. This is no exception. I believe that after 2 times I see diminished hair loss. As always, I thought it too good to be true, but I really think it works. I&#x27;ve combined the use of it with vitamins for improvement of immune system so perhaps it&#x27;s the effect of that combination. Also, a useful tip: often hair loss happens due to iron deficiency, see if this is something you can incorporate into your healthy routine. Overall this shampoo leaves my hair baby soft and very very shiny. So far so good!</li>
    <li> My son had success with this shampoo as he was experiencing early hair loss while at college. I decided I would order it also and I have been impressed with it. Massaging this into scalp and letting it set while I shower has not only made my hair thicker and more body. I noticed that I was having to clip my finger nails more often and they were thicker. Obviously the Biotin must be absorbing not only into my hair but into my system for this to happen.  When you look at all the great ingredients that are put into the product it is a great buy. I should get several months of shampoos out of the bottle so I don&#x27;t consider it an expensive shampoo.at all.</li>
    <li> 10% reduction in hair loss *maybe*. I have not been using this with any oral supplements either. For the price, I expected more. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> IT was defintly worth the money</li>
    <li> I was looking for a DHT blocking shampoo for my hair. Very impressed with the reviews of this shampoo.... BUT&lt;br /&gt;The ones praising the shampoo, are all fake. Look at their profiles. They&#x27;ve somehow ONLY reviewed this (or maye one other). Do not beleive these. Too bad. I need something I can trust.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 and have been very slowly losing my hair for a few years now. After only a month of using this product my hair loss as far as I can tell has stopped and my hair is getting fuller. Even at the very start of using this product the first time my hair looked noticeably thicker and now I can see the results of my hair slowly starting to fill back in. I also started taking  10,000 units of Biotin a day in combination with this shampoo which I believe has helped greatly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how this product holds up to aggressive hair loss but if your hair is slowly dwindling away like mine was, I can easily recommend trying this product out. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great. Makes my scalp feel healthier. I do not see much &amp;#34;Hair Loss prevention&amp;#34;. Does not over dry your hair. Its great for daily use. Cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I definitely notice less hair falling out. My husband has some new baby hair growth on top and he has been bald for years! This is the third time I have purchased this product and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> quick delivery will see if it works.</li>
    <li> My hair becomes way too dry when I use this shampoo however, I do see less fallout.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo last year and was using it for a while. Although, I don&#x27;t have a problem with this shampoo in particular, it is very pricey and I have found that it really doesn&#x27;t make a big difference in my hair volume, texture or growth long term. I would recommend other brands such as Jason&#x27;s Thin to Thick or Avalon Organics Biotin Shampoo, which are cheaper and produce similar results. I&#x27;ve had a lot of hair shedding over the past 5 years and the biggest thing I&#x27;ve learned while attempting to remedy it is that there is usually an intrinsic cause that cannot be fixed by a shampoo. I do think shampoos can improve the immediate appearance of your hair, but I have learned to spend my money and efforts on other products that can aid in achieving a more lasting result such as ground flaxseed, diet, and vitamins.</li>
    <li> My very fine hair has some volume now.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> So ive been reading all the reviews, good and bad, and all i can say is it works for me. This isnt a fake review as some keep saying. I have always had very little, very very fine hair that breaks and falls out easily. The shampoo has worked really well for me. It smells really good, its minty and it feels like ur scalp is getting stimulated from it haha but its great. My hair loss has reduced - i can tell in the shower, my pony tail ties, and brush/comb. I dont use the conditioner (i use Nexxus ProMend Conditioner, Split End Binding) but im ok with that, the shampoo alone works well. It makes my hair feel thicker and when i blow dry it i can tell its fuller with more volume too. I dont really care about the whole organic thing too much like others, just because things are organic doesnt exactly mean its better for u. It is a lil pricey but i think its worth it; it is for me at least. The first time i bought it was thru groupon and its worked so well ive continued to use it. In my opinion, yes it works, i love it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I use it every day and I take [[ASIN:B00Q5KMX5O Mynoxidrin - Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Formula Nourishes and Strengthens Thinning Hair and Promotes Hair Growth!]] with it. I have been using both of them for about three months, and I am shocked at how great my hair looks. It does not fall out anymore, and it looks super healthy. This combo is the absolute best thing I have ever seen for hair loss. Could not be happier .</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t use any other brands ever since</li>
    <li> This product did not work... I have damage hair because I dye it a lot so I was using organix shampoo and I wanted to give this a shot even though tmthe organix shampoo was working really well on my hair. After my first use more hair has fallen than it was before. What a waste... I&#x27;m going to use it for a week to see if it gets better if not, back to organix!!! And organix is cheaper</li>
    <li> good product hair become more smooth but still have dandruff, I am still looking for one product for my dandruff problem</li>
    <li> Bought this from groupon for 19 bucks. After 2 washes I already noticed the decrease in hair loss. After 2 weeks of use (I wash my hair about 4 times a week), hair loss has slowed down significantly. I used to see hair everywhere in my bathroom floor and it was horrifying to see how much hair I lost each day(my hair loss might be due to stress and lack of nutrition and sleep). After using this product for a few month the hair loss has reduced about 70%. I can&#x27;t say this product helps to promote hair growth, but it does work to prevent hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has a gel texture. It cleans very well, sort of like a clarifying shampoo. It&#x27;s perfect for peole who have oily scalp like myself. It maybe a little drying to people who have dry scalp and hair, but you can still use it regularly as long as you condition your hair well after washing ---to me a $5 panteen hair mask does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, although this shampoo is pricy, it lasts a long time because a little goes a long way. I have long hair and I usually shampoo my hair twice before applying conditioner. A bottle will last me at least 4 months.</li>
    <li> I have a mild receding hairline around my temples (arches) and since I was already taking saw palmetto capsules I chose this to see if the topical application of saw palmetto and argan oil, etc. might slow the recession. Like several other reviewers claimed, and i dismissed out of disbelief, my hair did in fact begin falling out by the roots after a week and a half of using this. Normally around 8 to 12 hairs around my temples will be brushed out daily, but i was simply brushing through the top, back and sides of my head and at least 25 hair follicles were discovered, several hairs behind my ears, the one place that never sheds.&lt;br /&gt;Also, like many others that doubted the seemingly ridiculous claims that your hair will fall out and claims that the majority of the positive reviews are fake, I was duped. A LOT OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE COMPLETELY FABRICATED BY PROFESSIONAL REVIEW WRITERS. Just peruse their wording and complete lack of reviewing history. Now, I&#x27;m not getting paid to write this by some competitor. This is my first review because I was really freaked out about losing by far the most hair I&#x27;ve ever lost in a single day, so i want to warn you that this is really unsafe.</li>
    <li> Really makes a difference. I notice that my thinning hair has more volume after I use this.</li>
    <li> Worked a little too well... after using it for a while the new hairs coming in were ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Not good for regrowing around hair line. But was good for overall growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a year now. I have seen a difference in my hair loss, there is definitely less hair in the drain now compared to when I first started.I would recommend this to anyone. I have seen an improvement, which I am thankful for.</li>
    <li> All I can is that it smells good. I only bought one bottle and I can&#x27;t say I noticed a drastic difference.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is good and definitely worth the price and so far works as mentioned have been using it for 4 weeks no complaints</li>
    <li> The product works okay. I wouldnt say its prevents hair loss 100%. Seems to thicken the hair after it dries out. Maybe you have to keep using longer than one bottle to see long term results.</li>
    <li> Just Started using this seems good. loving it. But bottle is damaged. pump on the bottle does not work. i had to pour in to different bottle.</li>
    <li> very drying, awful product</li>
    <li> One of the best hair loss prevention shampoos I have used</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and my hair is returning.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Even though it&#x27;s pretty expensive, it last for a long, long time due to the fact that you only have to use 2-3 pumps at the time. This is my 3rd bottle and I would recommended it to anybody who is looking for a good, Organic and healthier product than what you can buy at the store.</li>
    <li> seems to be working well so far, my hair was thinning and it makes my hair softer and thicker. and my scalp problems have gone away. not sure about it growing new hairs but will update in a few months. i also take biotin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 9 days now and it really does stop hair loss !&lt;br /&gt;surprisingly I have tried many shampoos before this one , but I can tell that this bottle delivers what is written on it !&lt;br /&gt;It dries a bit my hair but I dont care at the moment , all I care about is stopping the loss. I am planning to write another review after a month and tell you what I got.</li>
    <li> This is my first trial with US-brand organic shampoos. After two washes across a week my scalp felt less itchy and consoled to a great extent. I am grateful and thank you. Hope to experience the full benefit of your product.</li>
    <li> i ABSOLUTELY am never going back to my old Shampoo, I adore this shampoo, it makes my hair feel like it&#x27;s thicker and healthier. Purchase it to see for yourself!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any hair improvement which is why I bought this item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> It has very strong smell.</li>
    <li> This is a good Shampoo. I like the way my hair feels after I use this Shampoo.</li>
    <li> did not see any benefits</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried multiple &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos and by far this is the best one I&#x27;ve used. It gives your hair a nice full/thick look and leaves it looking healthy. If you have thinning hair you should definitely buy this shampoo.</li>
    <li> i loved this shampoo i would recommend it to anyone suffering hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost a month now and love it. Smells great and really makes my hair/head feel clean. I&#x27;ve been using Head and Shoulders for many years now and wish I used this shampoo earlier</li>
    <li> very happy with this product.....it does exactly what it says and there is a BIG difference in my hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and love the results - I can already see a difference as my hair looks thicker and fuller. I&#x27;ve actually already gone ahead and ordered another bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo that cleans well and leaves no residue.  Makes my hair feel thicker.  It remains to be seen if it helps grow hair.  I&#x27;ve ordered this before and it is expensive is why it&#x27;s not 5 star.</li>
    <li> I like it, I see some reviews that don&#x27;t but it seems to work fine for me.  I will be buying again.  October 7th,2014 On my second bottle now and still love it</li>
    <li> I have tried so many shampoos products to stop my hair from falling out but nothing helped. But after using this shampoo I noticed the big difference in a short period of time. It works wonderfully! and my hair fall is much less and It made the grey roots less noticeable. Great product!...Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for several months.  Not sure if it works all that well and smells like steak sauce!  It does make me remember to really scrub my scalp, which is probably the best effect anyway.</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems to be working as it states. It also smells really fresh and clean and a bottle seems to last a long time. It took me over a yr to use the one bottle.</li>
    <li> i think it is working, although i&#x27;m not sure what signs to look for. But, it is a good shampoo at minimum</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice daily for almost a year now. It helps with itching and prevents potential hair loss.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago, I must say I am not an average user. I am in bed 98% of the time, the only time I am out of bed is when I am in the bathroom. I can&#x27;t shower nor bathe in the tub, so I have a health care nurse come once a week or every other week. So she shampoos it then, one thing she always says is how thick it is and it has been going from grey to dark brown! I have not been able to see it before, but today I was able to see my dark hair on top of my head. I only saw my scalp before using this shampoo and conditioner. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> 30 days of use no hair growth all little fuller than Volume</li>
    <li> Excellent for shine and bounce.  Keeps color in longer than other shampoos.  I use a non-peroxide non-ammonia colorant and this worked well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo once daily for hair loss since October 2011. I also use a laser comb 2-3 times weekly and NuHair Thinning Hair Serum after the laser treatment. It took me a few months to begin to see a difference in hair loss. But after one year of continued use, the combined results have been very noticeable.  If you&#x27;re trying to combat hair loss, ignore the negative reviews and stick with this shampoo for year.</li>
    <li> I feel a difference with my hair.  Nice improvement!</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or hair prevention shampoo is great. It smells great, my hair feels thicker and looks great too. I would buy again and recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Some of the best organic shampoo out there! Glad we gave this one a try.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for 2 years now. It really works. No dandruff, keeps my hair thick, and smells delicious. I&#x27;ll use it until they come out with a good stem-cell therapy cure for male-pattern baldness. Hell, I&#x27;ll probably use it after too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo three months ago and it worked FANTASTIC! I reordered the same product and noticed it had different wording on label stating it was &amp;#34;advanced and improved. The ingredients listed are worded different. Also the shampoo was clear unlike the other I purchased which has a slight yellow color. This new formula DOESN&#x27;T WORK.</li>
    <li> Initially, I don&#x27;t see results about hair loss or regrowth but I feel comfortable using this shampoo because my hair is not too oily any more. So I kept using it and now I have used this product for more than a month, I found that I lose less and less hair when I washed my hair and I barely see hair on my pillow cover that I used to see a lot. I am pretty happy about it so I wanna write a review. Hopefully, this product can be helpful to other also.</li>
    <li> I like it and I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun since the 90s.I believe my hair stopped falling out and there might be new ones coming out. It&#x27;s only been a couple of months though, so I&#x27;ll come back in a few more months for an update.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say whether it works or not - I still have hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting much worse. I actually like the very herbal smell of the shampoo!!</li>
    <li> It definitely gave my hair healthy shine and thicker individual hairs. It smells and feels nice too. Use it. You won&#x27;t go back to what you are accustomed.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and use it every time.  It smells good and makes my hair feel good.  I don&#x27;t know if it will slow hair loss, but its worth trying as its a nice shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be helping slighlty with regrowth on the receding hairline. Nothing dramatic, baby hairs but thats a start. Hoping with another bottle the results will continue to grow. As of the product itself it smells nice and it seems all natural. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Ok - I gave it a year to be fair in my review. I used this on only one side so I can compare. Now, at the same time I&#x27;ve taken B12 shots for deficiency. So for whatever reason, my hair loss overall stopped. BUT on the side where I used this shampoo, it&#x27;s a little worse than the other side which looks normal now. So proof positive this dosent work.</li>
    <li> my hair always fall off, this one actually works</li>
    <li> great shampoo, after every use it left my hair feeling clean and soft. I only use 3/4 of a pump on my 3 inch hair and that makes this bottle last a very long time. Only con is it does not lather up like traditional shampoos but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less effective. I have noticed my hair has become stronger, shiny, and fall out less</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to Aveda&#x27;s pricey Invati system, which never worked for me after 6 months of using. I saw this and decided to give it a try. By no means is this &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; compared to what you can find in the drugstore, but it is so much cheaper than Aveda. I was shedding a ton of hair and whenever I put my hair up, a portion of my scalp could be seen at the hairline. I hated that! I have been using this with the brand&#x27;s organic argan oil conditioner for two months now. I still have some fall out but so much less than before. I also have a ton of fly aways growing and that scalp spot is barely noticeable :)  four stars because I now feel the need to wash my hair everyday..which means more product use and more frequent purchasing. I also don&#x27;t care much for the smell and I&#x27;m curious to see how this product will perform when I update my hair color.</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell it seems to be slowing the hair loss.  It has not completely stopped but I seem to have fewer hairs lying around.  It also seems to be a very good shampoo.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product my hair stopped falling out.</li>
    <li> If you have an oily scalp get away from this product. I was willing to pay more money for a shampoo because of a hair loss panic , but this made my hair greesier and did not reduce hair loss. There are better products in the market such as the La Roche Posey ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed to say, I didn&#x27;t see any results at all. I have pretty short hair as it is but my bald areas were still just as visible as when I started using this product. I did use globs of it as many suggested. I was hoping to see some sort of result or indication that it was working but NOPE, nada, Zilch. Oh, and I bought it off groupon when they had it for cheap.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is superb! Its make my hair thick and shiny. Higly recommended this product..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother purchasing this shampoo and conditioner in the hopes of easing the loss of your hair. Not only did the shampoo and conditioner make my hair more oily and stringy, but my hair felt dirtier after I used the products. Such is life with hair loss and the search for miracle cures!</li>
    <li> Great product! I have been using it for about 1 month and can see lots of baby hair coming out. After washing my hair, there is also less hair loss. The only thing is that you have to use conditioner after shampooing, or it&#x27;s impossible to brush your hair. But I think it is common situation for those shampoos with no SLS and no parabens. Plus, the smell is not bad.</li>
    <li> Definite results and hair growth. Use it every day</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo once daily in conjunction with Biotin (10,000mcg) once daily and Minoxidil (Rogaine) 5% applied twice daily for approximately 3 months.  I have noticed a significant decrease in hair loss when washing and combing my hair.  I also seem to have new hair growth where I was balding on the top/rear section of my head.  I have posted pictures but they are somewhat difficult still to tell the difference in them.  I will post again in a few more months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note the first 2 months I took Mynoxidrin pills twice daily but stopped due to the cost.  I also use another expensive non-sulfate shampoo to initially wash my hair. then use this shampoo and scrub it in lightly and let it soak for about 2-3 minutes into my scalp and last use a higher end conditioner and let that soak in my hair for 1-2 minutes as well.</li>
    <li> I have never seen so many positive reviews for something that didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo since the end of February.  So that&#x27;s, what, 4 months.  Nothing.  ZERO.  Absolutely zilch.  I&#x27;m so sick of buying things that promise to thicken your hair!  I&#x27;ve wasted so much money!  My hair is as thin and flat as ever.  WTF?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is wrong here.  Either at least SOME of you are lying, or at least some of you are imagining things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this company paying people to seed the comments?  I know Amazon gives people free stuff to review.  Is this \\&quot;verified customer\\&quot; thing just so much BS?</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or shampoo makes dandruff, even it doesn&#x27;t help to stop hair fall. It&#x27;s SLS free that&#x27;s why i purchased. Don&#x27;t buy any more</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, having tried a few other &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; shampoos out there. Being in my mid 30&#x27;s, I started noticing some hair lossand started using some different hair loss treatment shampoos. I was using the Biotene H-24 Natural Shampoo previous to trying this one out and I thought it was ok. Then I read some reviews about Pura d&#x27;or and decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve got to say, I&#x27;m impressed! I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I&#x27;ve noticed much less hair falling off in the shower. I use this in combination with the Pura d&#x27;or conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling fuller, and the conditioner makes it soft and smell pleasant. I am completely satisfied and will purchase this again, no doubt about it!</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a beauty magazine and thought I would give it a try. Great shampoo, light fragrance, good lather. Left my hair and scalp clean with no residue. No chemicals, my scalp was not itchy from being dried out after use. I will definitely buy this product again</li>
    <li> My eyes are puffed up and I feel I am allergic to something in the shampoo. It is too late for a refund so buyer beware. I really gave this a try and the only thing that is keeping my eyes allergic that I am doing different is the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the scent nor how dry it makes my hair.</li>
    <li> Wow!! This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve used it for about 4-5 months now and have noticed that my hair is growing thicker and I have tons of baby hair growing along my hair line and on the bottom of my scalp. I use this shampoo at least 3 x a week. In the beginning month I didn&#x27;t see any changes, but after 2-3 months + of using it I am definitely noticing my hair thicker and losing less strands.</li>
    <li> awesome product! from more than 100 hair loss a day, now i lose 5-10 every time i take bath. this is my 3rd bottle and i commit to use more</li>
    <li> Since January of this year, I have noticed alot of shedding.  For the past couple of months, I have increased my vitamin intake and have been using sulfate free shampoo.  I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about this product and decided to purchase it based on the positive reviews.  This morning was my first time trying it. Yikes!!!!!  My hair actually came out in clumps!  Not shedding or just a few hairs but what I would consider a \\&quot;pinchful\\&quot; of hair.  This has been the only thing different I have used since trying to minimize my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously there&#x27;s something in it that doesn&#x27;t agree with me.  Very disappointed as I had high hopes.  Just keep in mind that although it&#x27;s all natural, I doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s going to be good for you.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to everyone who cares about having healthy, organic products for their hair.</li>
    <li> I love it , it is working , I stopped to losing my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle after experimenting with a dry run. While using this particular brand I noticed my hair stopped falling out. Once I stopped using it, my hair didn&#x27;t immediately start falling out, but it gradually returned to where it was before I used this shampoo (on my hands and pillows). I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the scent, but my wife likes it and I like not seeing my hands and pillow full of hair. I recommend this product for anyone who is looking to slow down hair loss. It really made a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I have used many shampoos for hair loss. This is my favorite. Within a short time, the hair falling out in the shower is diminished almost completely. Its a little spendy but lasts a long time. it smells wonderful and makes my hair look shiny and clean. I also take good vitamins to help my hair skin and nails.</li>
    <li> Definitely helped with my stopping my summer shedding.</li>
    <li> First time trying. Hair feels very soft after use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product. My hair feels smooth and healthy. I have noticed less hair fall since I started using it couple of weeks ago. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> not work. makes your hair shreded...</li>
    <li> Great product, really fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK....leaves hair feeling clean.  Maybe to clean, as it seems to strip it of the natural oils.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good product, feels nice and immediately makes your hair feel more full.  Just added my second cycle, I currently have a full head of hair, but any hair line recession has stopped since using this item.  It has almost all the active ingredients that are recommended for hair regrowth and anti hair loss.</li>
    <li> I had bought this on Groupond and Loved it.. My hair feels so much fuller, even my beautician commented to me about the shampoo.. I tried so many different products that never worked because after 3 kids my hair thinned out a lot</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair on the back of my scalp. I tried using other hair loss shampoos but had little success. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months now and while no hair has grown back I am certain that the hair loss has slowed down and my hair feels a bit thicker too. This shampoo is recommended!!</li>
    <li> This product has definitely helped with the texture of my hair.  It is softer than before.  This shampoo has also strengthened my hair and there is a decrease in the fall out!  Glad that I tried it and I am pretty happy with it!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo!</li>
    <li> The short version of this review is that this shampoo plus prescribed finasteride 1mg worked amazingly good for my hair loss issue (seemingly male pattern baldness) just after 3 months of consistent use. Read on for details. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- How It All Started --&lt;br /&gt;I am a male in my 30s. I started noticing my hair thinning and falling off while combing and washing my hair about 3 months ago. It was probably a gradual process that started earlier than that though. I started taking pictures from above and saw significant thinning in the crown area. I was feeling quite miserable as no one would feel very good about losing hair. I immediately went online and researched on the best remedy. I found that the combination of finasteride 1mg (a prescribed medication) and some kind of shampoo that blocks DHT is the best solution. DHT is an enzyme converted from testosterone which will block and close off hair follicles leading to male pattern baldness. Taking finasteride 1mg also has an effect of stopping or slowing the generation of DHT in the body. The combination of the two have shown positive results for many. So I contacted my physician for the prescription and started my search for my hair loss shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Choosing My Shampoo --&lt;br /&gt;I debated between the Pura d&#x27;or and a few other brands of hair loss shampoo. Reviewers said Nioxin has changed its formula and it no longer works as before. DS Laboratories is too expensive. And a few others didn&#x27;t give me a feeling that they are as natural as Pura d&#x27;or and some didn&#x27;t even mention that they are free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) which is the another substance that leads to hair loss. I checked the Pura d&#x27;or website and read the description of this shampoo. I like the fact that it is using 100% natural and organic substance in the shampoo so I decided to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Results Will Take Some Time --&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair carefully everyday and I tried not to scrub my scalp too hard. For about two and a half months, I didn&#x27;t see any positive results. I would still see about 15 to 20 strands of hair as I was washing my hair. I see hair falling off while combing my hair and I see strands of hair on my desk from time to time. About a month in, I almost wanted to give up and switch to Ultrax Labs Hair Surge since it contains caffeine to, supposedly, stimulate hair growth. I was desperate but Ultrax Labs is simply too expensive since I know that I will in this for the long haul. So I stuck with it and diligently took my medication daily. Afterall, the Pura d&#x27;or website did say it will take a few months to see results. Before and after pictures shown on the website were between three to six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Conclusion After 3 and a Half Months --&lt;br /&gt;About the time when I have used Pura d&#x27;or and have taken finasteride 1mg for close to three months, I started to notice my hair was not falling off as much as before. While washing my hair, I was seeing no more than 5 strands of hair. I was so happy to see this consistently and I was glad that I stayed with the Pura d&#x27;or and finasteride combo. I notice that my hair is more dense and I can feel it while combing my hair even at the area where it used to be thin. My wife actually saw significant improvement even AFTER a recent haircut. I am pretty satisfied with that just after 3 and a half months of treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Pura Dor is not expensive at all. A 16 oz bottle costing $22 would last me half a year. I have gone through half a bottle in three months washing once a day, sometimes twice a day. And a side note on the cost of finasteride 1mg, it&#x27;s about $27 for 100 pills from Costco. So this came out to about $150 per year for this treatment. Not too bad given how much hair transplant may cost or how bad I may feel if I go bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat, I was using Pura Dor and taking finasteride 1mg at the same time. So I can&#x27;t say Pura d&#x27;or was fully responsible for my positive results. But give that my physician told me it may take nine to 12 months for me to see results from the drug, I have high confidence that my shampoo had something to do with it. I also take Biotin 5000mg on most days in a given week but it only makes hair healthier, it doesn&#x27;t have any effect on preventing follicles to close up. But I assume it gives my hair a healthier look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you feel that you may have or you are already suffering from male pattern baldness and hair loss is not a result of some other illness, give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was this review helpful to you?

    <li> *update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/27/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so its been about a month and my hair is fuller and new hairs have been growing in where my hair line starts. not too mention the clean feeling it gives me and i use it every morning when i  shower, also a little goes a long way. just lather it up. at first it didn&#x27;t seem to be working well cause i felt like it was not absorbing into my scalp so i bought a soft bristle brush shower brush like this one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Kingsley-Natural-Bristle-Shower-Detachable/dp/B004ZBH7SI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1411828054&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;Wooden+Shower%2FBath+Brush+with+Detachable+Handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use the brush in a soft gliding circular motion on my scalp after i lather the shampoo and not only does it feel amazing but it also works well exfoliates, cleanses, etc . i have significantly lower dandruff and less itchy scalp still some shedding on the brush but nothing like how it was before. i leave the shampoo on for two minutes after using the brush i rinse with semi warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have reordered the product because it makes my hair feel great but I don&#x27;t think it helps re-grow hair.</li>

    <li> Makes my hair fall out</li>
    <li> Has slowed down my hair loss significantly. Have been on it for 2 months so far. Hoping that I will see regrowth in the next few months. Using it along with minoxidil.</li>
    <li> Beware!! Bought this on the weight of the reviews. After third use my hair left in my brush was alarming. I had little hair loss, but thought this shampoo would be good for my hair. Absolutely not. It scared me to see how much hair I started to lose. I will be returning for a refund!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because of its promise to make your hair grow fuller and healthier. And yes it is true. It does made my hair grow fuller but it also made my hair smoother and silkier. I have a straight hair that I barely can manage because of my kids but now I don&#x27;t need to do extra effort after blow drying. The shampoo works really well for straight hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I am 62 years old and had been ill for a period of time.  It was then I became aware of a noticeable difference in the feel of my hair while shampooing; there was a lot LESS there.  In addition, I began to see more of my scalp at my part and my hairline.  Needless to say, I had to sweep my bathroom floor every morning!  My 20 year old daughter saw my distress, had seen pura d&#x27;or advertised and ordered it for me.  I can honestly say I love this shampoo!  It is rich and has a lovely fresh smell but, most of all, my hair has thickened noticeably and my hair loss has lessened.  I won&#x27;t go without this as I don&#x27;t want to loose the volume of hair I have now!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great for my very fine hair - it&#x27;s moisturizing and helps eliminate frizz. As far as hair loss prevention, I don&#x27;t really believe in shampoos being able to deliver significant results (vs. topical medications or diet {vitamins/minerals/protein}) but what I am looking for is an all natural shampoo that keeps the hair I do have healthy and manageable and want to stick around vs. fall out of my head, and I think I&#x27;ve found what I&#x27;m looking for in this shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair was shedding a lost. After using it for just a week i could feel that my hair shedding had considerably lessened. I however did miss the after shampoo smell of apples or strawberries that my previous shampoo had. Purador has no smell. Secondly,it becomes absolutely necessary to use a conditioner after purador. I have super oily hair so never really found the need to use a conditioner but after using purador a condition seem necessary. It however is one of the best shampoos i have used to prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is the product which I have been looking for. When I started using this product, I mainly had two concerns - whether it would actually work as advertised, and if I was going to experience any side effects. After using this product for three months, now I can say, it really works as advertised and it has no side effects. Pura d&#x27;or premium anti-hair loss shampoo is full of natural ingredients. It has no harmful chemicals. This solution works like magic. Now my hair feels stronger than before.</li>
    <li> This stuff not only smells awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my shedding has almost quit other than a few here and there. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Purchased this shampoo recently since I&#x27;m trying to use mostly organic products, and the no-poo method left my hair looking and feeling like straw. I&#x27;d been also noticing some hair loss with aging, and hoping this would help. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction in hair loss, but the texture and condition of my hair has visibly improved. Since it does not lather very much, I need to adjust the amount I use; a small amount of product goes further than I&#x27;d expect. Sometimes I forget to use conditioner, and my hair remains soft and easy to style. I plan to continue using this shampoo, and am curious to see if the hair loss improves.</li>
    <li> I felt very comfortable when I was using it. And surprising the smell is not disturbing but comforting as well. And  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I broke out with itch from this stuff. I do not know what it is, maybe the Niacin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did make my hair thick thick.  did not grow new hair.  I wonder if the argan is the thickener....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very obvious that after the use of the shampoo, my hair becomes less oily, I would like to continue to use the product and hope it will have much better results.</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft, shiny and beautiful!  I have fine blonde color treated hair in my late 30s and have noticed more shedding then I would like.  Much less hair loss after initial use!  Will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing!  Having a great deal of hair loss after going through menopause. this stuff has made a world of difference.  Use this along with coconut oil. I use the coconut oil first, leave it in a few hours covered with a shower cap. Then I wash it out with this shampoo, then wash again for good measure. Hope they never stop selling this!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now. I love that it is organic with no sulfates which are very harmful to your hair. I have noticed less hair falling out in the shower. So far I am content with this product and will continue to use because it leaves my hair feeling healthier.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo.  It is the most I have ever paid for any shampoo.  It leaves my white, thinning hair (after a severe car accident and months of hospital and rehab) thick and shiny.  My one problem is that even though it came sealed, no matter now much and trying both directions, the black top will not pop up and I am left unscrewing the top off and use the shampoo that is on the inside wand.  Twice.  With that I have enough shampoo.  If you could send me a replacement black top, that will take care of this problem.  Le me know what you decide. And you seem to have me on an automatic send a new bottle every two months plan.  Which was never explained to me initially.  Please notify me in a timely manner so I can decide to renew.  With the exception of the top, your product is excellent.  I thank you.</li>
    <li> My scalp used to feel itchy after shampooing but I haven&#x27;t noticed that since using the pura d&#x27;or for about a week.  A little goes a long way. It smells pleasant and lathers well. I feel confident that it&#x27;s not aggravating the situation, as it seems gentle, but I&#x27;m not sure how much a shampoo can prevent hair loss or regrow hair. I&#x27;m going to keep using it because I like it, feel good about the ingredients, and if it can help even a little bit with my hair - it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Smells great! I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on DHT and hair loss. Hoping this is the answer I&#x27;ve been looking for. Seems to have everything in it (and those you don&#x27;t - not in it) to fight the good fight!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost half a year. It does work pretty well for me: I&#x27;ve noticed that the lost hair has reduced and my hair looks fuller.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> ok I guess didn&#x27;t see to much</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair straw like. My barber even asked if I washing my hair.</li>
    <li> So far I love it. I use it with extra strength biotin, also found on amazon.  I can tell a noticeable difference in hair strength and health. I&#x27;m a 25 y.o male with slightly thinning hair on the crown.  Between the biotin and this shampoo, there is some new hair growth where my hair was thinning!</li>
    <li> This is the second purchase of this product.. I tried another shampoo for a few days but I noticed that my hair fall increased so I immediately started using this shampoo and it stopped!!! It&#x27;s amazing!!! This is a great shampoo for dry hair too and I use it even without a conditioner... My hair is great and I am very happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> Have only used it a couple of times since I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair everyday but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading all the great 4-5 start reviews out there. I have a full set of hair... however, I&#x27;ve always had  problems with shedding.  I lose about 100 strands every time I wash my hair.  I wash my hair every other day.  I was super excited to purchase Pura D&#x27;or and I used it as soon as I received the package in the mail.  To my horror, I started shedding like a dog during the summer as I started to rinse out the shampoo from my hair after leaving it in for a few minutes, per instructions.  The stands came off literally a handful at a time!  I lost about 2x as much hair as I normally would in one wash.  I new right away this wasn&#x27;t going to work for me.  So I went back to take a deeper look at the great reviews....Low and behold 95% of the 4/5 star reviews looked absolutely fake.  These reviewers had either never reviewed anything other than Pura&#x27;Dor...OR they had reviewed other items but all on the same day!  Hmmm....Sounds like the company had hired these folks to do the bad deed.  Then I looked at the 1 star reviews that talked about increased hairloss after use....and I wanted to cry.  Anyway...BUYERs...beware...this product doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to....and it may make your shedding worse like it had done to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, the  Amazon return process/policy was awesome.  No hassle at all and return shipping was covered at no charge.  Thank you Pura D&#x27;or...for at least doing that for me.  :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo since last July. My hair loss is the same as it was with any other hair loss shampoo I have tried. I like the smell of the shampoo. I use it every day and still have about a fourth of a bottle left. People complain about the foaming but it depends on your hair type for how much it will foam if you only wash your hair one time per showering/bathing. If you have really oily hair then it will foam less but it doesn&#x27;t mean that its not cleaning your hair. If you prefer more foam then you can use a little bit and wash/rinse then repeat and the second time you wash it should foam alot. I wash 2 times every shower and I keep it on my scalp for about 2-3 min before rinsing the second time. It does help a bit with adding volume to my hair. I recommend people give this a shot if you are looking for something new. The ingredients are great and the price is currently cheaper than when I last bought it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s OK I guess - it&#x27;s just expensive shampoo!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for few months now but don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair yet. Works great if you use it along with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  After a week of using this my hair feels fuller, less tangled and seems to be falling out much less.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t stop my hair loss, it&#x27;s clearly a high quality product and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> About 5 months ago I began to experience severe redness &amp; irritation on my scalp after shampooing with my regular products that I have used for quite sometime. My hair stylist also began noticing the redness as well as hair loss on top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 55 year old male who has always had a very full head of hair so this began to worry &amp; depress me.&lt;br /&gt;I began doing a lot of research and found that this redness &amp; hair loss was probably the end result of a common shampoo ingredient called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. Many other reviews and articles seemed to confirm this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an inexpensive detergent and makes mixtures foam well and seemed to be in almost all shampoo products. Just google &amp;#34;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll come up with a lot of startling information on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Amazon after reading many reviews to find a replacement shampoo without sulfates, I found Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo and to boot it promotes hair growth &amp; fullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after using the product for 6 months I&#x27;m much happier. The redness has completely stopped after 2-3 weeks of use and my hair felt better and thicker. More natural looking and not so &amp;#34;stressed&amp;#34; looking some days. My hairdresser agrees, it is fuller now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has indeed arrested any further hair lose as the shower drain is no longer clogged with hair and there is little signs anymore of lost hair strands on my work desktop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very few shampoos out there have the benefits that this one has. I&#x27;m happy with the product and will continue to use it. It&#x27;s more expensive but for me it&#x27;s worth the end result.</li>
    <li> This is a great product with a great zesty smell (lemon-y). I have been using it for two months an although I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible hair re-growth-- the animal cruelty-free and natural additive product is a bargain at it&#x27;s price range. Overall it leaves my scalp feeling healthier and cleaner than the other products I have been using. I don&#x27;t find my scalp as itchy throughout the day and it leaves the hair soft and smooth. I&#x27;m thinking about buying the conditioner and start using both to see if results are more visible. I will see if I can write a follow up review within the next 6 months and hopefully will be able to bump it up to a five-star if I do show signs of hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> Great product, definitely has helped since buying it.</li>
    <li> Really like how my skin feels after using this product. Been using it for about a month now and have noticed less hair shedding.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if my hair loss is completely stopped. I believe it has reduced. This product has no ideal characters of regular shampoo, it has no smell or anything. I used have a lot of loose hair on my pillow, now i dont find it that many. This doesnt regrow hair, so its just for stopping your hair loss. I show up some new grey&#x27;s i am not sure it its because i am getting older or because of the shampoo. Overall i like the product i will buy again.</li>
    <li> The sole fact of taking part of my time to write this review is prove enough of how much I liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;It has a delicious scent: fresh and exotic without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I feel it stimulates my scalp and therefor hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing I get all this benefits from a product that uses organic ingredients makes me even happier.&lt;br /&gt;I would deffinetely recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m not noticing anything positive (other than clean hair). I&#x27;m switching to Nizoral to see if it makes a difference. My impression of this product is that it&#x27;s just an expensive shampoo</li>
    <li> This is a sad as well as a fun story of my life. I had severe hair fall problem. I was accustomed to see the bald spots on my head and my friends often made fun of this. I used to wear hats all the time, but really determined to solve the problem. Just after 5 months, my friends became surprised. There were no bald spots on my head, rather the shiny and dark hair of my head really surprised them. They asked me that how it was possible! I told them about Pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo that changed my life. I used it just for four and half months and it gave me this radical change. After hearing this, one of my friends used it and got the same results. It is a miracle product for regaining new hair!</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo for hair thinning and dry scalp. Also helps flaking.</li>
    <li> I love the way way the way my hair felt after I used the shampoo. I have used it several hair loss products for my hair but this tops the list because of its natural state. It did not affect my hair color.</li>
    <li> I have bought at least 10 bottles of this shampoo in the past--all using Groupon. Let me explain why. I am a mother of four who decided I was accomplished enough to not have any more children. Therefore, I decided to try the Mirena contraceptive IUD. My third year in, I began experiencing terrible hormonal imbalance symptoms--one being excessive hair loss. My hair became dry, ragged, brittle, and it shed terribly. I was so afraid I was going to go bald. When I came across this shampoo on Groupon, I ordered, and to my delight the first wash showed a significant slowdown in the shedding. As I washed my hair more and more with this shampoo, the shedding all stopped. My hair began to fill out again, and I was relieved and happy to have my hair back.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I moved and could not find the shampoo on Groupon anymore, and I was running out of my reserve stock. I fortunately had the Mirena removed after five years of trauma, but once removed I began experiencing additional hormonal imbalances so I decided to take Vitex fruit (which I loved!) but my hair began to shed once again. Never-the-less, I am very happy to have found this shampoo for a decent price once again here on Amazon. I highly recommend it, and when I have it, I do not use any other shampoo product in my hair. Let me say too, it cleans well without too much stripping. Just follow the directions on the bottle, and I believe you too will be happy.</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo for a little over 3 yrs now and still love it! Since I have been using this product I have noticed a major decrease in hair loss while shampooing and towel drying hair. Also doesn&#x27;t dry out hair like other hair loss/thickening shampoos I have used. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This one smell is good. I can&#x27;t wait to see the result.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a few days ago, and I tried it today. First of all, it smells pretty good. It&#x27;s like some kinds of woods, which was one of my favorite smell. Secondly it was very fine and smooth, also cleaned very well. It&#x27;s easy to wash, but a little bit dry if do not use conditioner. I&#x27;ll see if it works on losing hair later. Remember to keep it on your hair for 2 mins</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with  this shampoo as I have very fine hair and it adds more volume and it makes my hair appear thicker. I have noticed less hair loss when brushing my hair . My hairdresser has even commented that my hair seems thicker. The shampo is rather expensive but it lasts longer than OTC 16 oz. bottles. I have used this product for about six months.</li>
    <li> I can tell the difference when washing my hair! Not much hair loss and the smell is great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months &amp; notice thicker hair. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Recently received the product and used it right away. It smells and feels great on my hair. So far, definitely a 5 Star product.</li>
    <li> I have used this previously and it worked the best! I used up my last bottle so I had to buy a new one thru amazon! This shampoo is great one to prevent ur hair loss!</li>
    <li> It really help me, I saw the difference within a month... I&#x27;m also using it for my 4 yr old and can&#x27;t complain I&#x27;ll keep buying the product.</li>
    <li> As a person who is very skeptical of everything and only became aware of my thinning hair after my significant other pointed it out, I decided to try this product. I must say I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results. Even after only a few weeks of use I&#x27;ve noticed a significant decrease in the amount of hair falling out from just applying styling product to my hair. I will never go back to using any other shampoo  again.</li>
    <li> It just received today. Smells good, not bad.</li>
    <li> it is a great product.I love it. The smell is good. More importantly, it works.</li>
    <li> I just got it today and try it, but already see a difference in my hair. It seems healthier and thicker, as well as shiny. For an organic shampoo, it lathers well and smells nice. I plan to order again!</li>
    <li> I have bought this product recently. It is one of the best shampoo that I have ever used. It gives a volume to hair. I feel very comfortable with this feeling. I can not comment on effect of hair loss for this product but it does not contain harmful material that harms to hair like known brands. It is fully organic and it affected my choice. I suggest this shampoo since it does to harm to hair there is a chance to decrease hair loss if the reason of hair loss is harmful materials that is used other than genetics.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since i got it, and let me tell you this works just the way i was expecting it, and even more! It does what it says, and there isn&#x27;t anything i would change about this product, it has made my hair 100% more better and i will be a long time buyer of this product to protect my hair in the long run. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It did get my hair soft and smooth. The smell is not like other chemical shampoo, maybe less frangrance. Since I am just trying to protect from further bald and taking biotin. It seems working as subsidiarity. Will recommend to friend at least.</li>
    <li> Nice Smell , shiny hair &amp; when I used it I notice less hair lossing ,also waiving hair less dandruff, fast delivrey ,, thank amazon</li>
    <li> This product really helped me. My hair fell better since the first day. I do not have any irritation and my hair looks better. I really recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product on Groupon.  Now, it is the only shampoo I use!  I used to have to use Rogaine, and was never really sure it was helping but was afraid to stop using it in case it was!  Pura d&#x27;or has helped so much, I know longer have to use Rogaine and my hair has thickened to the point where my scalp is no longer visible when I wear my hair down.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three weeks, and noticed less hair on the floor. I am really happy about this product and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> A wonderful shampoo. It lathers easily, so I&#x27;m not using a lot at one time, and my hair feels clean after use. Always a sceptic, but if there is a shampoo that helps retain your hair, then this may be the one.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it all that long yet, but my hair feels stronger. I still see plenty of my hair in the tub drain &amp; on my comb though. I&#x27;m hoping that over more time the amount of hair fall out will be less. It has a nice relaxing eucalyptus scent to it that reminds me of a spa day. It leaves my hair feeling soft &amp; my scalp feels clean.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this product really works but it does leave my hair feeling silky smooth.  I&#x27;ll post the results in a few months.</li>
    <li> I have some serious issues with this product.  When left unused for a few weeks, it seems to thicken up considerably.  It gets to the point where it is as thick as tree sap.  This makes  it pretty hard to use, and really hard to work into your hair.  At first I thought there was something wrong with my product, but when I open it up, I can easily see that it starts to separate and the thick part sinks to the bottom, where the spout is.  Once I cleaned out the spout and really shocked the bottle up, it seems to help a lot, but it begins to become a pain after another week or so.  Not sure I would buy again.</li>
    <li> been using it for almost a month and so far it okay. My hair does seem fuller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m older and have very thin hair. I have used this shampoo for over a year and feel that it has reduced my hair loss as well as giving it a little body and shine. Also, I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance. It lathers up really well and the bottle last a long time.</li>
    <li> Not sure one way or the other of its ability to keep or grow hair,  but it does feel thicker when using the product.  Note,  i have used this product for several months and plan on doing same for a long time.  Figure it is worth a shot, and not seeing any detriment effect.</li>
    <li> The label lists some exotic sounding ingredients, but does it work at preventing hair loss? I checked their website for the results of a double blind controlled study, but none exist. &amp;#34;Hair loss prevention&amp;#34; seems to be more of a marketing gimmick then a true elixir.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! With great odor, and you&#x27;ll find your hair looks volumized when they are dry. About hair loss? This organic shampoo seems very safe and healthy for everyday use, I would definitely want to keep using this product to see the volume of my hair really grows.</li>
    <li> DO NOT KNOW IF THIS ITEM WORKS...</li>
    <li> I happened to notice the ad of this product two months ago. Since I have the problem of hair loss, I decided to try it. After two months&#x27; use, my hair loss apparently reduced which gave me much confidence.</li>
    <li> I have so far ordered about 6 bottles. I am really satisfied with this purchase. I also use Laser Hair Comb, Vitamins along with this Shampoo and the results have been very positive. I have used various brands of DHT Shampoo and finally settled for this one. The most important factor for me is the absence of chemicals and parabens from this Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Well, not sure yet whether to leave a 4 star or a 3 star. I will keep it to 4 star for now. I have been using this for a month now. Although this shampoo gives a nice full volume look after its use im yet to significantly notice any hair loss prevention. There is still some hair loss I&#x27;ve been noticing. But def. not a bad product to try. Neutral smell and high volume look.  Will wait for one more month and then decide whether to bump a star or to reduce it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!</li>
    <li> So far this product seems to be working well. It makes my hair more manageable. The only thing that I do not like about it is that is does not lather well so I feel I have to use more to get a good lather on my hair.</li>
    <li> great product! really help my husband for the hair loss prevention. we will keep using it and wait for the result. Price is reasonable. recommended for everyone who need the hair grow.</li>
    <li> My hair is fallling out due to a med I take and this product has definitely slowed it down. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the shampoo, it is really works!!!! My hairs are shiny and have a healthy look. I bought it because i was loosing my hairs an every day, this great shampoo helped to avoid any problems with that. Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> It us effective! After using it for the first time, I feel my hair loss becomes less. I do like the SLS free formula. I do switch shampoos in the same week. So the difference it prertty obvious when I am not using this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t foam much so I suggest buyers use the foaming net while using this. Also, I think in order to make its effect the greatest, you need to stick with it for a certain time period. Because if I went back to my original shampoo routine, I still lost hair. I tried to use nature&#x27;s gate conditioner after the shampoo, it worked well. But occasionally when I went back to use my Aussie 3 min miracle conditioner... It turned out to be very terrible. Apparently there was my hair in the bathtub again. So I guess... Organic and natural hair products are gonna be my option in the future. Hopefully if I continue to use this shampoo, my hair can greatly grow.</li>
    <li> This product helped stop me losing my hair for over 2 years now. If it wasnt for Pura d&#x27;or, I would have been bolder than my grandpa by now! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!</li>
    <li> Did not like for hair but am using for face wash.  Left my hair feeling dry and tangles.</li>
    <li> Just got it and used once. It smells good and I feel good after washing my hair with this. I wash my hair daily so I would appreciate products that do not contain harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Only used one time, noticed the hair fall off much less than before! Will continue using it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who has hair loss from a thyroid condition. She has been using the Nioxin 2 three step system with good results. But, she has been so excited about this product. She does not have to spend as much time doing the three different applications. She has stated that the results are better than the Nioxin and she also does not need to use conditioner, which saves money. I have to admit, I tried it also and it is a great product. I will be purchasing this again and would recommend it to anyone that has a hair loss issue.</li>
    <li> Natural smell and it&#x27;s really mild. I definitely lose less hair now. I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Overpriced and did not volumize hair like it says. My hair appears greasy after use and scalp doesn&#x27;t feel clean. I don&#x27;t know maybe its just me but I won&#x27;t buy again..</li>
    <li> It helps me grow my hair fast.</li>
    <li> Item arrived earlier than promised and it is as advertised</li>
    <li> Totally useless! It just gives a little volume to the hair. That is all. No hair regrowth... I stop spending tons of money for useless hair regrowth products. The best way is hair-planting.</li>
    <li> Great product. I was using ovation cell therapy shampoo but I switched over to Pura d&#x27;or because it has better ingredients and it gave me better results and the best part is it&#x27;s much cheaper. Hair is looking much more soft and thicker and not as dry and limp anymore. Highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this product because she was losing hair when she showered. After using this shampoo for about a month she hasn&#x27;t seem any hair in tub. So according to her it&#x27;s working very well and she made me write a review just because she loves this product so much.</li>
    <li> I was recommended by friends. My hair loss problem mainly comes from big pressure. Anyways, it&#x27;s been a week since I stared to use this shampoo. I was amazed by the results. After the first time I used it, there&#x27;s a significantly decrease in hair loss and I didn&#x27;t brush my hair before wash, which brings my faith back and start to believe that Pura d&#x27;or could really help. Also, it definitely increases the volume after my hair dry out. My hair is soft and thin and doesn&#x27;t have much volume. Hope this review help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but I&#x27;m already noticing that my hair feels thicker and softer. It looks shinier and more &amp;#34;alive.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t wait to see how it improves in the days to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for about a month now and I like it. It&#x27;s not as moistorizing I thought it would be but i like now it lathers up without having to use much product. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell. I miss my cheap supermarket shampoos that smell amazing but im happy that the product is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain all those strange chemicals. As for hair loss. Not sure yet.</li>
    <li> I just got the product. Love the smell of it. My first use was pretty good.</li>
    <li> Works good. Lasts long. Compliments the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Recently bought this shampoo just thought I would try it out to help with scalp dryness (as it contains argan oil) and saw that this was an amazon best seller. The shampoo itself is great, smells neutral and moisturizes well. I was initially skeptical as it contains a herbal DHT inhibitor, however the long term effects of DHT inhibitors locally remains unclear. The shampoo itself works great and relieves dryness.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this shampoo and so far it has been my favorite shampoo I have used.  It feels gentle on my scalp, it&#x27;s not scented (which I prefer) and I like the all natural ingredients and essential oils.  It&#x27;s states that it&#x27;s hair loss prevention, I don&#x27;t really know if any shampoo actually works for that, but I suppose it can&#x27;t hurt and my hair seams healthy.</li>
    <li> Whoooooah ! I have been having \\&quot;follicle\\&quot; issues for a while. And with that said, I have tried and experimented with a lot of products that promised almost miracles to miracles. And to date, I have not seen those miracles promised. As the saying goes, sometimes \\&quot;simple\\&quot; is best. As I mature and get more in to fitness and care maintenance of this body, I research for the next best product(s) that will help me prolong the aging process and help me to squeeze out every bit of mileage from this vessel of a body.    While researching products on Amazon, I stumbled upon this bottle of Pura d&#x27;or  and again contemplated on ordering it. I asked myself will this be one of those products that I tried in the past? The important thing was that, it was affordable and all the ingredients that I am now familiar with from researching hair maintenance.    I&#x27;m sure that what works for you may not work for me and visa Versa. But I&#x27;m sure that this product will do you justice for using this product for the purpose that you are ordering for.    I used this product as instructed and on some days just did an extra washing and left  to soak in to my scalp. And within 3 month&#x27;s I started to notice some fuzz in areas that are being challenged by their thicker and fuller follicles. Do not expect over night miracles or you wont be satisfied. I deliberately waited a tad more past the show &amp; tell dates. I started to see the fuzz and as days and weeks went by, I noticed that some strands were getting stronger and color coming back. What I love about this product is that it&#x27;s simple and does what it is said to achieve. My barber notices that my hair looks fuller and my hair cuts come out flawless.    If you are sitting on the fence PLEASE GET OFF and order this product ASAP! I hope that Pura maintains it&#x27;s price points so that it is affordable and accessible and most of all stay with the standard of quality of this product.    I love the results of this product, that I ordered the conditioner companion product. My only regret was to not take a before &amp; after photo of my situation. Great product guys over at Pura d&#x27;or PLEASE KEEP THE INTEGRITY OF THIS PRODUCT FORMULA AND NOT CHANGE IT.    Thanks Guys!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month. Because it is still too early to tell, I cannot fully vouch for this product. However, I think this product has made a difference in the thinning of my hair. I also see a difference when it comes to volume. Hopefully, I continue to see great results.</li>
    <li> I was using this product for the past 3 months, there is a visible decrease in my hairfall.  I was having hairfall for the past 2 years , i used a lot of products but i couldnt get any good results.Really satisfied with this product and decided to continue using this pura d&#x27; or. This shampoo is costlier than other ones but i could see the result.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for about 2 weeks and like that it is free from parabens or anything harsh. Also, it lathers up nicely and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. Will have to update more later after using it for a longer period to see if hair loss is diminished.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  My hair has gotten thinner through the years but now appears thicker and stronger.  I&#x27;ve been using it in combination with Coconut Oil (put on my scalp and lightly over hair about an hour or two before I shower).  I also put a little Tea-Tree oil on the sides (where hair is more thin) before I sleep.  This combination of products seems to really be helping!!!</li>
    <li> I had been problems of hair loss and oily scalp. I got this a week ago. I feel better for loss hair. My scalp is not oily after use this shampoo. Other organic shampoo always made my hair oily  before. I feel good with this shampoo and I think I don&#x27;t looking for the other shampoo anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and am already experiencing noticeably less hair loss. This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.My hair has never looked shinier or healthier. I would recommend this to anyone especially if you have thin hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Smells great and made my hair fuller and thicker!</li>
    <li> Researched every type of shampoo on the internet prior to purchasing and have been very pleased. I have Been using this for the past 6 months and wish I had found it sooner. Ive had thinning hair for years.  I Use rogaine and this shampoo.  Thanks to this shampoo my Hair and scalp feels great with no residue- doesn&#x27;t have laurel sulfate which is a big plus.  Hair feels really clean and stronger and scalp is much cleaner - I have had issues with scalp acne but haven&#x27;t had acne on my scalp since started using this product.  Hair loss has been at a stand still for some time and having this as part of my regiment has helped. I would recommend to anyone with hair loss or scalp problems.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a quite good product for hair. It is a little dry after using this shampoo, and I have to use the hair conditioner. But it really works for me, and the smell is good.</li>
    <li> Most natural shampoos do not lather well but not this one. It lathers well and I cannot ask for better ingredients than organic. I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks and mixing in a little cayenne extract for stimulation of blood flow in the scalp. It feels really good afterward. I still see hair in my drain but it appears to be slightly less. I also take Nuhair supplements. Hope to see more evidence of positive result soon.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the smell and overall feel of the shampoo.  It lathers nicely...rinses cleanly...and has generally left me with the impression that my hair is indeed thicker than in months past.  I will certainly keep using it for many more months as I continue to evaluate.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Leaves your hair shiny! And hair feels firm and strong, this product has been working for me perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> Researched a good, natural shampoo and found this one on Amazon. Had good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. Price was a bit much for a shampoo, but I&#x27;ve been losing my hair like crazy, so this was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it, my scalp itched like crazy and I had flakes. This could possibly be due to me changing three different shampoos in one month. Even with the itching, I did notice my hair was bouncy and manageable. Not weighed down or greasy. So I&#x27;ve now been using the shampoo for a month, and the itching has subsided, and my hair is still manageable. As far as hair loss, I&#x27;m still losing hair, but not as much as before I started using this shampoo. I also started using coconut oil treatments, which have also helped a lot with my hair loss. I&#x27;ll continue to use this shampoo until it runs out, then I&#x27;ll decide if I should buy more. A little bit of the shampoo does go along way, compared to my other shampoos that were bigger.</li>
    <li> This product arrived faster than expected, I was very impressed by that. It smells really good, I have used it for a couple of days and can not wait to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> i noticed the amount of hair falling out in the shower is reduced...even on the very first day i used the shampoo, and through out the day as well. i&#x27;ve also saw that my hair is not as oily the next day with this product (usually my hair gets so oily the next day that it looks flat). overall my hair feels softer, lighter, and fuller in body!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if this works or not, but i feel like my hair is a little thicker and my hair is softer.</li>
    <li> Product came as promised and discrided. Top of the pump was slightly damaged from shipping but I can manage its use. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am not sure about the function of preventing hair loss is efficient or not, however I am like the quality of this shampoo. After washing my hair, the shampoo can easily be washed off and leaves my head a refresh feeling, and of course make my hair clean and fresh. It&#x27;s also very important that it contains no chemicals in it, and this kind of shampoo is better to your hair.</li>
    <li> Advantages: Shampoo is light; it&#x27;s noticeable that there aren&#x27;t strong chemicals in it.  I shed a lot and notice that after using this shampoo, my hair sheds a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantage: It doesn&#x27;t lather and bubble up as much as regular shampoos, but then again, maybe that&#x27;s what causes hair to shed</li>
    <li> This shampoo helped my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She likes the way it makes her hair feel.</li>
    <li> Good for dry hair, sulfate free if definitely the way to go. Haven&#x27;t seen hair growth/thickening, but it smells great!</li>
    <li> I have had issues with my hair and severe thinning. Within about 7 days of using this shampoo consistently the hair fall had slowed and my scalp was so much better. My hair is starting to feel full, enough to make me happy. I love the fresh scent and it leaves my hair feeling clean and thicker somehow. I will definitely continue using this product. I think the price is a bit high, but the product is well worth. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> It was very gentle, less chemical feel, I feel my hair clean and fresh, with less detergent-like stuff retained after wash. My only concern is, I may need to keep using it once I am addicted to it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife - who seemed to be losing more hair than usual- so review is really hers:&lt;br /&gt;I admit I initially thought this was too good to be true, but noticed a significant difference with the very first use! At first, I thought it was just the result of using a different product. However, as I continued to use it, I continued to get the same results! I have naturally curly &amp; wavy greying hair - a textural nightmare at times. It is highly unusual for it to behave well consistently. Knock on wood - I have never been &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; with the way it&#x27;s been behaving for this length of time.The results I experienced:  More manageable hair - it requires less time to blow dry it, and because it responds so well to a round brush during drying, I don&#x27;t even need to use a curling iron. It feels lighter, has more body, is easier to touch up before running out the door. Because my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down by product, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it needs washed nearly as quickly, so the healthier practice of NOT washing hair every day is easy! My hair stylist told me (just yesterday) that she&#x27;s noticing new growth AND that a trim wasn&#x27;t needed b/c the ends were very healthy. I get some low-lights for partial coverage of grey - was concerned about not using the &amp;#34;color protective&amp;#34; products...turns out that this stuff will not strip the color b/c it&#x27;s natural &amp;  doesn&#x27;t container those damaging chemicals.</li>
    <li> I liked the smell and the way my hair feels after I use it. I have been losing hair excessively and I know I won&#x27;t get results overnight, but so far it has left my hair feeling better than the other products I was using before. I had damaged hair due to dying it regularly and ironing it. Hopefully this shampoo helps out!</li>
    <li> Using twice a week noticed less hair shedding. Product does not strip hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to update.</li>
    <li> The shampoo suds nicely and has a nice subtle scent. I hate perfume-ridden products, and this is not one--it has a more natural scent that is pleasant rather than overpowering. It&#x27;s hard to say whether it is really doing anything to prevent hair loss--I kind of doubt it. But, I will continue to use it because I like it anyway.</li>
    <li> I think I am allergic to one of the ingredients in this shampoo. I noticed my scalp itching quite a bit after the first use. After using it for about a week I have developed a small rash at my hair line. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin like me. I think it actually exaggerated my shedding because of the skin irritation. It also made my hair tangled and difficult to manage.</li>
    <li> I have used this natural ingredient shampoo three times, My hair feels softer than with normal shampoo,In terms of the hair loss effect,It need a longer period to find out the hair loss prevention effect.this shampoo is gentle,it is indeed the best shampoo.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! already recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year now. I cannot say I have more hair, but I do know my hair is falling less than before. I am using it with the Pura d&#x27;or premium organic conditioner. People complain about the smell, I do not have a problem with it, it does not smell as perfumed, but I would rather have it like that than a product full of chemicals that harms my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because is organic. The fact I am buying again says a lot since it is not cheap. I think this is a good product.</li>
    <li> My hair was falling a lot for the past few years and so I did a lot of research on the hair products over the internet....I was looking for best organic shampoos and conditioners that would help with preventing my hair loss... that are sulfate free with no parabens and no harsh chemicals and i came across Pura d&#x27;or organic shampoo almost a year ago. Although i was skeptical in the beginning, i gave it a try and was very happy with the results. I noticed less hair fall after few a months and the my hair looked and felt more thicker and stronger.  I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it now. My hair becomes softer and more smooth. What troubles me is hair loss; my hair fell even when I was walking...I&#x27;m not sure whether it is seasonal, but now it is much better. This shampoo is very mild to me; perhaps it works!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Smells great and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Using very little shampoo, it cleans the hair exceptionally well! The hair and scalp feel very fresh after shampooing and my hair has stopped falling out and has gotten thicker. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used to use Nioxin, but switched to the Pura d&#x27;or because it had more natural ingredients. First few days were a bit of an adjustment getting used to, but now that I am adjusted to it I really like it. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used this shampoo. It smell really good and feel so clean after using it. I have thick hair and it makes my hair soft and smooth. I don&#x27;t know if it will prevent hair loss. But I will keep using it to find out. So far it&#x27;s the best shampoo I have been using.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo i have ever used, wife has stopped using her $60 a bottle shampoo / conditioner for this.. really great results!</li>
    <li> I love it, every time  I used it, my skin felt very comfortable. I usually had very oily skin but now it changed a lot</li>
    <li> It seems my hair looks thicker after I washed it for the first time. I will keep using it and see what will happen after a month.</li>
    <li> I have a very fine thin hair. Before using this shampoo I was losing hair way too much of hair. After using this shampoo I can definitely say the hair loss has reduced. Have been using this shampoo over a year and very satisfied.</li>
    <li> no smell and lathers good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different shampoos with less chemicals in them and since I have thinning hair I am naturally looking at the hair loss/thickening types.  I haven&#x27;t used this for very long, so I cannot comment on others claims of regrowth.  Good smell, hair feels great and stronger after use.  This is the third &#x27;poo I&#x27;ve tried out and so far the best.</li>
    <li> This product has been used for a month so far. I strongly recommend this product because I saw results already after 2 weeks of using this. Following the instruction properly and having it in the hair for 2 minutes each time. My hair has gotten way thicker and has a lot more volume. My hair looks very good now compared to before, it has enhanced not only the volume but also the thickness of my hair. I do not see any more hair loss either, this product prevents hair loss, and I think I have gotten some gain back also. Very satisfied by this product and recommend it strongly, cannot wait how it will look after one bottle use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to add is that the bottle never seems to end, I even use two pumps and have been using it for more than a month, still have not passed 1/3 of the bottle!</li>
    <li> Good. It&#x27;s hard to identify if hair loss has decreased but anyway the shampoo seems to be good for it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a baby mum.Taking care of baby make me exhausted and my hair get loss and loss.Resorting many people i chose to buy one Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, Brown and Blue, 16 oz. First it&#x27;s organic ,it contains no  hazardous substanceation .Sencond , it works ,my hair stop loss .Is it amazing? I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really love the shampoo so far!!! It leaves my hair silky and shiny, and it is extremely gentle. I have a very sensitive scalp that is easily irritated by harsh chemicals, and this does not irritate my scalp at all. I use other products to manage hair loss, so I was looking primarily for a shampoo that would be complimentary to my treatment and this seems to work well. Love that all the ingredients are natural and that is has a pleasant natural scent.</li>
    <li> the shampoo is free of chemical, so it won&#x27;t damage the hair. the shampoo smell is like chinese herb smell. in terms of hair loss prevention, I haven&#x27;t use it long enough to validate the claim, but I can assure you that I feel the shampoo is working as I feel my hair is stronger each day.</li>
    <li> I just receives this an used only a handful of times, so as far as the preventing an restoration of hair I can&#x27;t comment on so that&#x27;s why I gave it a 4 using the shampoo as many others have stated, it doesn&#x27;t lather up as one would normally expect, however one squirt does a great job, cleansed my hair an scalp, my scalp hasn&#x27;t itched an my hair has been very soft an shiny an manageable, so I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo an will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product and I really want to return it.  It left my hair dry.</li>
    <li> Great product; nice scent and lather; Only used one bottle so far so not sure about long term hair loss but anecdotally seems to be less hair falling out when I run my hands through to dry after shower. My wife now uses it too (doesn&#x27;t need for hair loss) and she claims her pony tail is thicker. Likely not as potent as some prescription products but very happy so far with purchase</li>
    <li> Ya know what? This stuff works. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months with good results. It seems to somewhat strengthen and thicken my hair. I feel like my thin spot has filled in a bit too. It&#x27;s subtle but it helps. Hair Loss &amp;#34;prevention&amp;#34; may be the key word.</li>
    <li> The odor is strong when you wash your hair, but it goes away after you rinse it. It is not as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is good to fight against hair loss. The only problem I&#x27;m having is that it leaves my skin a bit dry, but I&#x27;ve seen good results so far.</li>
    <li> This product is great,my hair doesn&#x27;t fall off when i shower.like it used to.</li>
    <li> Primera vez que uso este shampoo y me parece fantastico!!! deja el cabello muy manejable y brillante.  Espero que tambien ayude a prevenir la caida del cabello.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Very pleasant to use.  It lathers nicely and leaves my hair soft and clean.  It feels very gentle and leaves me with a feeling that I did something good for my hair.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Used it about 5 times. The smell is a little strong, but so is my sense ofsmell. Lathers up great and makes my hair have more volume.</li>
    <li> I purchased Pura D&#x27;or Hair loss Prevention shamppo(blue labeled bottle) and found it lived up to its advertising. Shampoo is a bit pricey but worth the extra cost.It lathers quickly and has a great fragrance.It gives shine to your hair and leaves it very manageable. Over the weeks using it I have found less hair loss too.  I would recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month so far. I don&#x27;t see much difference but feel good when I shampoo.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and will keep using for a while to test the result.</li>
    <li> even though i do not see a reduction in hair loss after the first use, this shampoo definitely performs as well as my previous shampoo which is more expensive.  thus i think i will stick to this shampoo for now</li>
    <li> Just received the shampoo last night. Tried for twice and my hair feels so good. Better with conditioner after this I think because my hair is a little dry after using this. I&#x27;m using this because dad is losing hair a lot recently. I will buy more this product as gifts for my dad and friends if it can truly prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo for about a month, I have noticed a little improvement in not as much hair falling out. This is not a miracle product that will suddenly prevent all hair from falling out, but as long as your expectations are realistic you will be satisfied. It is rather expensive for what is an average sized bottle, which is the reason for the 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> This product lathers up great..this products leaves my hair smelling great.. I would recommend this product to anyone..</li>
    <li> Hair loss has reduced a little, but havent seen dramatically changes yet. Need to observe a little longer to be certain whether the shampoo is really working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and feel its worth the money. My barber tell me this is the healthiest he&#x27;s seen my hair since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I waited a couple of weeks so I would have adequate time to give a review.  I love the organic shampoo.  It lathers well, cleans and then rinses completely.  I  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been bothered by the hair loss issues since I came to the US. I bought this because someone recommand it to me. At first, I doubted whether this product really works or not. After using it for 3 weeks, I think my hair loss less now. Every time after bath, I could see much less hair in the bathtub. Maybe it is a little expensive than other shampoo, but it seems somehow works. I used it everyday, and it seems my hair loss less.  I don&#x27;t care about the ingredients, but just concern about the performance. I think it is good.</li>
    <li> First time use this shampoo. It&#x27;s good, but the price is a little bit higher than other shanpoos. Hope to stop lossing hair and increases volume !</li>
    <li> The shampoo was leaked when I opened the package. I was not comfortable with it</li>
    <li> I have had hair loss problems for as long as I can remember. I have tried EVERYTHING under the sun. This shampoo is a Godsend!!!!!!!! The argan oil leaves my hair SOOO VERY SOFT and whatever the secret is that helps with my hair loss is nothing shy of a MIRACLE!!!!! THANK YOU SOOO MUCH-- Marti</li>
    <li> I USED IT FOR 1 WEEK, IT SEEMS TO LOSE MORE HAIR.....I think the other reviewers are fake</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working. I won&#x27;t say that it was miraculous and grew back all my hair, but I have noticed that when I follow the instructions and leave it on for two minutes before rinsing, I take less hair out of the shower drain. It has a pleasant smell and I like the natural ingredients. I just purchased my second bottle, so I&#x27;m satisfied. It is pricey, but it&#x27;s the only shampoo I&#x27;ve tried that has actually made a difference in the amount of hair falling out. It also lathers really nicely so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s good shampoo. Probably too soon to speak to any hair loss impact. Smells good and leaves my hair looking clean--you know, like shampoo.</li>
    <li> I do really love this product. I have a big trouble of my hair after I came to U.S. In the beginning, I just brought some cheap shampoo in the walmart. My hair went off my head badly. Then I found this. I brouht it and tried it. It smells good .When I use this shampoo, I don&#x27;t need a conditioner at all. M y situation is becoming better. I will keep using it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting up there in age and my thinning hair is telling me the same.  But i don&#x27;t wanna go there without a fight.  After a ton of research on Amazon.  I decide to give Pura d&#x27;or a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does work.  It&#x27;s not magic.  I used it for nearly 3 weeks before both my wife and my hair cut guy begin to tell me they notice a difference.  I leave it on for about 2 minutes in the shower before rinsing.  It smells really good too.  It got some good oils and other stuff.  All I know is that my hair stopped falling out as fast.  That&#x27;s what matters to me.  I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to say if this item has an actual effect on the regrowth of hair...but what I can attest to is that it DOES make my scalp and skin feel wonderfully amazing. As I grow older I find that my skin has become overly sensitive to many chemicals, specifically many of them which are being used in health/beauty products (the irony). After searching long and hard I came across this product and its great reviews! Now I can join the chorus! The dry scalp, dandruff, itchiness that were either cause by or exasperate by most other products, have been solved with this one. I can only imagine that having a healthier, cleaner scalp is far more conducive to the maintenance/sustainability of a great head of hair. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve seen significant changes in my hair conditions ever since I started to use this shampoo. My hair get greasy super easily and I&#x27;m constantly losing hair. This product adds an extra shine to my hair and my hair-loss conditions have greatly improved. :)</li>
    <li> This shampoo is seriously a dream! I have thick hair my whole life and the beginning of this year I started noticing bald spots due to over processing my hair. So I ordered this shampoo because of the good reviews and it actually works plus my scalp stop hurting. The huge plus is it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals in it to further destroy my hair. My father has also been using it and has seen a huge improvement in the thickness of his hair.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s expensive but it seems to be working and now I have to keep buying. It&#x27;s hard to say exactly what&#x27;s working, but my hair loss has stopped. I really like this shampoo and use it every time. It smells good and makes my hair feel good. I don&#x27;t know if it will slow hair loss, but its worth trying as its a nice shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, hug size.</li>
    <li> I am 44 with fine, straight highlighted hair and before I started using this product my hair was becoming noticibly thinner, falling out and breaking off.  I bought this shampoo and the conditioner in August.  In the last 5 months my hair is growing!  On my last two visits to my hairdresser, she couldn&#x27;t believe how much my hair had grown.  And she showed me all the new growth.  In addition to using this product, I also stopped using a toner after my highlights.  I felt like it was too many chemicals for my hair.  My highlights may be a little streaky now but I think that has helped prevent breakage.  Also, I shampoo almost every day and after 5 months I still have more than 1/3 of the bottle left.</li>
    <li> My hair does not fall out as much as it used to, therefore I am thinking this is working :).</li>
    <li> After about a month, I can really see less and less hair falling out as i brush my hair. the shampoo works and it&#x27;s great! it smells like ginger, and makes your scalp feel good. I would definitely get another one when this one run out.</li>
    <li> It really works. The first day I noticed a significant change and is getting better everyday. Now I&#x27;m hardly losing hair.</li>
    <li> Well after just a couple of weeks of use I cant say I see results, but im not expecting them yet!  I can say that the product does have a interesting clean smell, and takes very little to create a lots of lather.  It leaves my hair feeling very clean and soft, not dry like others have said.  Looking forward to continued use and hopeful results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for more than 7 days. It seems that my hair loss problem has become better now, but I&#x27;m not quite sure if it will stop my hair loss problem. This product is not cheap, but I believe it will work, since I saw that there is an ingredient called &amp;#34;He Shou Wu&amp;#34;, which is said to be a useful ingredient in China. I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I like the Organic shampoo but have only been using it for approximately a week. No results yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will see some hair growth soon.</li>
    <li> Works great, comes out of the bottle, goes on top of your head and shampoos in.  Rinses of well with water.  Leaves hair feeling clean</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t feel much difference in the first week but the second week it got much better with a lot less hair loss. would defiently recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 6 months and love the way it makes my hair feel. I&#x27;ve never been too picky about shampoos but I&#x27;ll probably never switch again. It cleans your hair with all organic ingredients and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling dry and brittle. I don&#x27;t use conditioner anymore. A little goes a long way with this stuff and it definitely ends up being cheaper than any shampoos you get at the store. Will continue to purchase this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Definately gives more body and fullness to thin hair without weighing down. Rich lather and neutral scent.. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, leaves my thin frizzy hair soft and bouncy.  Definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a short while now in combination with a product or two from the Nioxin line. There is a distinct difference in feeling between the two, the conditioner from Nioxin leaving a cold and minty feeling on the scalp but this shampoo leaving a warming feeling. Sensations aside, it&#x27;s difficult to tell if the product is working like it claims. Friends who know I&#x27;ve been struggling with hair loss and noted a new thickness to my hair, so there may be some improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond it&#x27;s effectiveness, it&#x27;s a great shampoo. Great feeling, lathers well, and very gentle on the scalp. Worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying this shampoo out.  Better to be safe than sorry!  So far it seems like a good shampoo.  Cant speak to any of the benefits yet</li>
    <li> This is the strongest, healthiest  &amp; silkiest that my hair has ever felt from the 1st use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really helping to prevent hair loss, I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, have noticed less hair loss.  Leaves my hair clean and healthy!  Nice natural fragrance.  Plus it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> I believe I recieved a counterfeit product! I have purchased several bottles of this shampoo over the last year and have always been very satisfied. However, this latest order was different. The actual blue label is a different shade of blue than normal, the product discription listed on the back is written in a different font, the pump head is a different size and shape, and the actual shampoo has an entirely different consistency and smell! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo, works well, makes hair fuller.  I have noticed that it has made a difference with my hair not falling out.  I will post a updated review on it in a few weeks once I use it more.  Great product, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife. Seems working well. She likes it very much and we bought another bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for two weeks and I love it!! Since I had a hysterectomy I have had a lot of ongoing hair loss and this is really helping me. I love that it is organic and that it works with my color treated hair. I don&#x27;t see a drain full of hair anymore. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My mom commented on my more recent crown hair loss, as &amp;#34;you look to be your grandfathers child&amp;#34;, referring to his late life hair losses.....&amp;#34;you should try some of those hair loss shampoos&amp;#34;.  So I decided to give &amp;#34;Pura d or&amp;#34; a try as it is the most popular on Amazon.  A skeptic from the get go, I must say, regular use has made my hair appear fuller, and given me hope that my fate is not genetically sealed per Grand daddy Burkhart.  I do like the smell of the product and it lathers up well.  After 3 months of regular use, I do believe the losses have dinminished and I am more confident about more &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; in my future!</li>
    <li> Super dry for hairs. Not working at all. I even feel there are more hairs dropping off overtime when I wash my hairs.</li>
    <li> I like this product. i have been losing hair when using another product. I switched to this product and thought it doesnt hurt to try. Then my hair losing slowed down and almost stopped now. I am lucky i switched!</li>
    <li> I purchased this particular product because of it&#x27;s high ratings on here. Amazon should seriously consider only allowing ratings by verified purchases, because this product has done the complete opposite of what it claims. I have been using this for 4 weeks now and it has to be due to this shampoo!!  This is the most hair I&#x27;ve EVER lost in my life and in this short of time!!  I literally looked in the mirror again this morning and wanted to cry.  If my picture doesn&#x27;t convince, you - I don&#x27;t know what will...but if I can save another woman (or man) from this anguish, I might feel a little bit better.</li>
    <li> I cannot attest to prevention of hair loss as I have been using this shampoo twice a week for only a month.  It does clean well and leaves my hair soft and silky.  I think the smell is fine and not perfumy as many shampoos are.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. As a parent with a newborn around I gave this shampoo the real test! It would have to conquer an extra days worth of grease and grime every now and then; and it did so without hesitation. I don&#x27;t mind the smell (some of my mothers kertine type shampoos smelt a lot like puppy shampoo). My hair is fine and I often have trouble finding a shampoo hat doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it a fly always disaster zone, but this shampoo leaves it feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using it too and he says his hair does feel thicker. He&#x27;s working on a touch of male pattern baldness so he could just be grasping at straws ;) I couldn&#x27;t say for sure about the hair loss prevention part. That&#x27;s not terribly fair though. I am at that stage of post pregnancy where your hair falls out for days and days and DAYS. It hasn&#x27;t been able to slow that down a bit ;) Maybe I owe the fact that there is a single hair left on my head to the change in shampoos though. If that&#x27;s the case I probably should have given it 5 stars as there is still a dozen or so left :)~</li>
    <li> It does definitely give a apparently reduce of hair loss! Great Product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo saved my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Six months after I delivered my baby boy, my hair started to fall...a LOT! I was expecting changes in my body but this wasn&#x27;t going away! Every time showered, I&#x27;d cry. After researching hair loss products and having tried everything...and I mean e-v-e-r-y-t-h-I-n-g, I stumbled upon this wonderful product. Kiss your receding hairline goodbye!</li>
    <li> Shampoo smells very good.  Requires lathering and leaving on scalp for 2 minutes.  Natural combination of ingredients.  I&#x27;m not certain if it helps with hair loss, but I can say it either helps maintain or may help modestly help with hair loss (when combined with Rogaine and Propecia therapies).</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 4 months now and I&#x27;m not sure if it really works.  I&#x27;m still seeing hair on my hands while shampooing and it seems to be the same amount of hair as before I used the product.  I see hair on my forehead growing out again but I use rogaine on that part of my head so I&#x27;m not sure if the shampoo is helping that.</li>
    <li> This is originally my husband&#x27;s shampoo, he ordered it because of it&#x27;s natural solution for hairloss. I liked the sent and texture his hair after hairwash, so I decided to try it, and I love it. I have used it since then, and it makes my hair soft and healthy looking and it improves my scalp&#x27;s condition.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my hair feeling fantastic.  The scent is not the best; however, it smells great for an organic shampoo that prevents hair loss.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty natural shampoo for the hair. I have hair loss problem, but after I used it for two weeks, my hair improved. It&#x27;s gentle to oily hair. It shows oil, but it makes oily hair turn more clear. Also the smell of the shampoo is gentle, which is what I like.</li>
    <li> Feels better.  I noticed some hair shed during the first week I used this product, it stopped after the initial loss. After 3 weeks of using it  daily the quantity of my hair appears to be like what  i prior to using the product. I definitely noticed my hair to more manageable/softer than before. I have curly/fizzy  hair and I was using Nioxin 1 + Pantene conditioner and then had to use fiber creame to make my Hair manageable. I now just use Pura to wash hair, do not use any other conditioner and might use a hair get some times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I can say that shampoo stopped my hair loss but definitely made my hair feel better than before using the product.</li>
    <li> Hair comes out thick, I see new growth after the first wash.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of hair loss prevention shampoo. The first bottle worked so well (over a year ago) that I didn&#x27;t need any more as my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out by handfuls anymore. You will not see results right away, but after 2-4 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;I started having hair loss again (not as severe as before), so I wanted to get a jump start with shampoo since I know it works.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great! And a bottle will last quite a long time. I believe my prior bottle last about 6 months with daily use.</li>
    <li> Really really love this shampoo !!!! I have bought like 10 bottles so far &amp; I also get the conditioner that goes with it!!!! I love the smell of it &amp; how it makes my hair feel!!! Super clean super healthy &amp; it really cut down on my hair loss!!! I use to pick up so my hair out of the drain in my shower but now I don&#x27;t!!! I highly recommend this shampoo!!!!  :)</li>
    <li> My partner and I are men in our early 40&#x27;s. I myself, have been struggling with a thinning hairline that has become more pronounced over the last 5 years. I had previously been using Nioxin system 5 for noticeably thinning and color treated hair. I decided to order this product based on the reviews and others experiences. Immediately after using this shampoo we both could tell that our hair was not as muted and appeared shiny which was a huge plus. After 3 weeks of using it and taking biotene tablets orally daily, I have noticed some regrowth forming at my hairline and my partner had noticed tiny thin hairs appearing on his scalp! My hair appears much thicker and fuller and that has given me a boost in self confidence. Aging sucks, and I for one am going to age as gracefully as possible. I truly believe that Pura D&#x27;or Hair Loss Shampoo is a step in the right direction for us.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this product to me and it really works after I using it for six months, I would recommend it to others who has the same hair loss problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveda, Kiehl&#x27;s for over two years. However this product is really refreshing and can substantially reduce my hair loss. It helps remove the oily feeling of your scalp and keep your hair with breath. Strengthening and thickening can be noticed. Good one, I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! My hair was falling out abnormally fast when I was using just a grocery store brand. But this one is OK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a while now and really like it.  I don&#x27;t know if it has slowed down the hair loss but I like how my hair looks and feels, so I will continue to buy it.  Wish they had a smaller size for travel.</li>
    <li> This shampoo not only smells wonderful, it is made from all natural ingredients. I have had a serious amount of hair loss but when I use this shampoo it gives my hair body and doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh it down like the anti hair loss shampoo did. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on whether or not it slows down hair loss. Will update with that info.</li>
    <li> I  trust this product. It is not a scam. It really works. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and it has far exceeded my statndards</li>
    <li> Stopped hair loss a week in so far...great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it &amp;#34;prevents hair loss&amp;#34; but it cleans the scalp well. The formula is what made me decide on the product. I like the fact that it contains tea tree oil, argan oil, and zinc as all of these ingredients have been proven to be beneficial for your skin. Even though it may seem like a small bottle, if you have short to medium length hair, one bottle goes a long way. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible. It smells like a health food store. You can immediately smell the herbs. Not a good scent. It is gentle. I have been using it for months. I don&#x27;t see much of a difference. I went and bought Rogaine.</li>
    <li> Great product and service. Thanks</li>
    <li> The pump cap is really bad and it got stuck in from first use.</li>
    <li> No visible difference after 2 months of usage. I am using this in conjunction with toji pure density tablets. Would continue to use for another 2 months and then compare</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my boyfriend. I hope it will work to prevent his hair lost.  I found it&#x27;s much cheaper on the official website. It&#x27;s 24.99USD with 5USD discount and no tax need, plus you can get a free bottle of organic argan oil which worth 24.99 USD. So buy it on the official website.</li>
    <li> Too drying for my permed hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had beautiful hair and was complimented on it, often!  Not so much, anymore.  Unfortunately, my hair is much finer now and I&#x27;m experiencing overall hair loss, I&#x27;m 59.  I&#x27;ve been taking measures to try and mitigate the problem i.e. Hairmaxx and vitamin supplements.  After reading the reviews on the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner, I decided to give it a try, as well.  While I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth, my hair is definitely fuller with body and shine, like I used to have.  Yeah!!  I would recommend this shampoo and conditioner to anyone .. even if you don&#x27;t have hair loss issues.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is strange. It smells like bubble water. But it makes nearly no bubbles on my hair even though I use a lot.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month and my scalp feels fresh and clean, very similar to the feeling after brushing my teeth. I am still not sure if it is making my hair thicker or preventing hair loss. I will keep using this to see the long term effects, I am happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo for both the quality and value. Just one pump is all that is required to lather your head and it seems to really do the job. As I&#x27;m getting older I noticed a little thinning, but after using this, it certainly seems to be much better at making my hair appear more thicker. Also haven&#x27;t noticed any additional hairs in the shower!</li>
    <li> Feel so pure after first time wash, it can last whole day to control the oil and scurf, very good!!</li>
    <li> Carole&#x27;s daughter does the same with the 1st shampoo her kit Monoi</li>
    <li> What I really like about this is shampoo is the value. I feel that given its size and its claim, it seems like a deal. However, as to rather or not the shampoo is effective against hair loss, it&#x27;s too early for me to tell since I have yet to use it for more than a week. I should update this review in a month and compare it to the other hair loss product I have purchased from Amazon</li>
    <li> I love trying out new and different hair care products. I also have 2 daughters that help out with the reviews for certain products, hair care is one of them. My hair is normal, a little drier than I would like from coloring and everyday wear and tear so trying to find products that actually work is always a chore. There are some tried and true brands I stick with but I do love to at least try others out. Ya never know when the next best thing will come along!&lt;br /&gt;So I was offered the opportunity to try, and review Pura d&#x27;or Hair and Body Care products.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil Premium Organic Shampoo, Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil Premim Organic Conditioner, and the Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil Body, Hair &amp;Face Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the products first and then let the girls each give them a shot.&lt;br /&gt;The Premium Organic Argan Oil Based Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo is one of a kind. It contains 12 DHT Blockers, creates thicker hair and prevents from further hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;The Premium Organic Argan Oil Based Conditioner adds texture, shine and volume to hair. Our shampoos and conditioners are free from SLS, Parabens and Gluten!&lt;br /&gt; I tried the shampoo and conditioner first the day after they got here. The Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo cleaned my hair well. No residue left behind and it was easy to use. The shampoo was a thinner consistency, but nice and easy to rinse out also. It did leave my hair feeling a little dry, I guess is what I would say. I was in the shower when I used it but I think it more felt over clean...if that makes any sense. At that point I wasn&#x27;t too sure the conditioner was going to work, I assumed it was going to leave it feeling dried out too. Thankfully that was not the case. The Pura d&#x27;or Conditioner worked awesome! The conditioner has a thicker consistency and it was easy to use and rinse. No residue left behind when I used it either. The conditioner worked itself left my hair soft, smooth, and manageable. The scent of the shampoo was an earthysmell. It was a good smell but not usually a scent I would choose for my hair care products. I guess it didn&#x27;t matter too much because the conditioner smelled great. Strong enough but not too strong and overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters each tried the shampoo and conditioner too. Emmaleigh (5)  said &amp;#34;I love this stuff!&amp;#34; when she came out of the bath. She has long hair and it tends to get tangled but that wasn&#x27;t the case when she used Pura d&#x27;or. Tierney (11) loves to try anything related to hair and beauty and she loved it too. She was not as excited as Emmaleigh but she did say her hair felt smoother and it was easier to brush after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I tried the Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil Body, Hair &amp;Face Treatment. It smelled like the shampoo, the Argan Oil does have a distinct scent. It was not oily and left no residue or flakes. The oil did help keep my face feel moisturized and fresh. Pura d&#x27;or The Pure and Organic Argan is great for skin! It&#x27;s 100% cold pressed. It helps create smoother skin, restores nutrients to cells and reduces scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See FULL REVIEW HERE ------&amp;#62; http://aimlessmoments.blogspot.com/2015/03/pura-dor-hair-body-care-review.html</li>
    <li> my hair stopped falling and it is now fuller and healthier than ever, just ordered my second bottle it is worth it every penny!</li>
    <li> So. If anything changes, I will change this review. Here&#x27;s my report.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely lost more hair while using this. I&#x27;m 30 days into the bottle, and definitely thinner in the front of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now, other products (nioxin for example) sometimes warn that the initial uses may cause more shedding.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m more inclined to suspect that this shampoo is a garbage scam, because:&lt;br /&gt;-the ingredients on the bottle are different from the ones listed here on amazon. Many more chemical compounds listed, and even though they are listed as coconut extracts, it is STILL chemical compounds.&lt;br /&gt;-a lot of the 5 star reviews here on amazon are CLEARLY fabricated. Clearly someone worked on those reviews- there are some absurd grammatical errors, amongst some really strange sentence formulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m stopping using for now and if I don&#x27;t see any recovery and re growth in the areas that shed, well, it may be time for some firm actions to be taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will report back shortly.</li>
    <li> I feel like this shampoo has done nothing to my hair. It also smells horrible. Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> Hair appears more healthy</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair well without stripping away the good stuff. The smell has an earthy aroma, but the product works well. A little pricey, but gives a squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> Product seems to work, my hair feels thicker after a few washes. Comes packaged neatly, smell is nice. However the dispenser doesn&#x27;t seem to push down - I have had to remove the applicator and stick my finger in to get the shampoo. Overall would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> This smells great and makes my hair feel wonderful.  It looks thicker but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen increased growth.</li>
    <li> Followed instructions for quite some time and nothing.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning for several yrs. now so I tried taking biotin and that did slow it down but after using the Purador shampoo my hair loss has stopped and the shampoo makes my hair feel thicker. I can see new hair growing in slowly. Im hoping with continued use I will have my thick hair back!</li>
    <li> I am just about finished my first bottle of the Pura d&#x27;Or shampoo and am about to order another bottle. I love this shampoo as it has does wonders for my hair and scalp. I realized last Fall that I had been suffering from some thinning hair and had a particular patch of hair loss. I was devastated and decided that I had do something. I threw myself into research on the internet and discovered Pura d&#x27;or, and read all the rave reviews! Well I can wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviewers and can vouch that this is the best shampoo out there for my thinning hair predicament. The shampoo lathers extremely well, and it leaves your scalp and hair feeling super clean and healthy. My hair looks great and seems to have better volume and body, and perhaps as well has help to stimulate more hair growth in conjunction with my Minoxidil treatment. I have tried the Aveda Invati solutions, and it cannot even compare to Pura d&#x27;or. Plus the Aveda Invati is much more expensive. I am very happy with Pura D&#x27;Or.</li>
    <li> I bought this off the companies main site. It unfortunately made my hair feel like straw. Used four times and now I have to go through a deep conditioning regimin. Kind of my fault I guess I shuld have not used it after the first wash. Did not expect such results for a product that promotes itself as gentle. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a daily deal web site raving about this product. I was bothered by my hair loss and for this price, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. I&#x27;m very glad to report back this is a very good product as far as cleaning goes, rich foam, pleasant smell and very easy to rinse. As far as preventing hair loss, I would give it a 3 star compare to the 5 star for cleaning. It did make my hair looks much healthier but I haven noticed any change to stop my hair loss, just reduced the hair loss a little bit.</li>
    <li> Works really well! You may get dandruff, though.</li>
    <li> p good product; nice scent, doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate me. i like the way it makes my hair feel--soft &#x27;n&#x27; full. too early to really say, y&#x27;know? fast shipping, tho. thanks.</li>
    <li> This has been my most favorite shampoo in years! Smells great, no harsh ingredients and because a little goes a long way I don&#x27;t feel it is overly expensive to use. Highly recommended. Now checking if this company makes body wash and conditioner too!</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo I have minimal hair fall, hair looks healthier and stronger. Definitely recommended! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! I have thin oily hair and I was looking for something that will make my hair thicker and stop my hair from falling out. I realized that I can only use organic shampoos for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this everyday for a few weeks I started to notice my hair get thicker and my hair stop falling out. Now when I put my hair on a pony tail, I can really feel how much thicker my hair got. Will definitely be ordering this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to say that I have been using this for about 2 months now almost everyday and the bottle is not even half empty. I apply about 2 pumps to my roots only and then use a conditioner for my roots</li>
    <li> The smell is a little too strong, but it smells natural. Hair loss is little less than before after first use. The hair quite soft and not too tough even though I didnt use conditioner. I will keep using to see if any more great result.</li>
</ol>
