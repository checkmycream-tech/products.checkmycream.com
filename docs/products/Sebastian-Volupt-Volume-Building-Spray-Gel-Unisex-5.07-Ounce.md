<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have fine hair and this weighs it down.</li>
    <li> SO GLAD I CAN I STILL GET THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I am not sure that I do actually get a lot of volume when I use this, per se, and I have to use another product on my ends.  But, I do feel like it gives me pretty good lift at my roots.</li>
    <li> This Volupt Volume Building Spray-Gel by Sebastian is SOOOO AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thin hair.  It is naturally dirty blonde but I color it a lighter blonde with lots of highlights and lowlights.  I have never had any success with volume building spray.  I tried John Frieda volumizing root spray and it made no difference.  I don&#x27;t generally use product on my hair because it just weighs it down and makes it look greasy or stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought there was no hope...until I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have steam rollers that I use for curls and volume in my hair.  Caruso - and they have been a MIRACLE for my hair.  Seriously, look them up.  Anyways, I don&#x27;t need any hair spray or product when I use these rollers.  I tried the spray-gel by Sebastian before I used the rollers, and the curl was visibly larger and the extra volume was noticeably there!  I was amazed!  Normally, by the end of the night the curl is basically gone and it&#x27;s all flat by the next morning again.  But when I used the spray gel, it was still voluminous the next day!!!  I woke up with sexy hair!  This was just astounding to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried it when just wearing my hair straight.  I put it in and blow dried my hair for about 5 minutes (I was in a hurry) so it was still really damp when I left for work.  Let me tell you - I still had so much volume!  And it STILL lasted into the next day!  This product really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for more volume or think that your hair is limp and hopeless, GO TRY THIS PRODUCT!  It is worth every penny!  It also smells nice and light and feels light on the hair.  Absolutely no greasiness or stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> First let me say that I received this product for free to try as a Bzz Agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I have really fine hair. Not baby fine, more like boring, limp, stringy fine. I can&#x27;t do anything with it. It doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, it doesn&#x27;t look cute straight out of the shower, it just lies there flat &amp; icky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really skeptical trying this product because I&#x27;ve tried many other \\&quot;volumnizing\\&quot; shampoos before, but hey - this girl is pleasantly surprised. This spray gel is light, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all goopy &amp; sticky. I used the shampoo &amp; conditioner first, then after the shower sprayed directly onto my wet hair, brushed it through &amp; then just blow dried. I didn&#x27;t do anything fancy at all...and yet, wow. It looks pretty darn good! My husband even asked if I went to the hair salon. Ha! That&#x27;s funny &amp; worth buying this stuff just for that.</li>
    <li> Not too heavy, but still helps style the hair.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My mum got it originally for me as a Christmas present and I&#x27;ve been hooked every since. It just seems to do to my hair what hairspray, gel, and moose could never do.</li>
    <li> This product is really amazing. I have dealt with flat, thin hair my whole life. Spray this on before blowdrying and it will bulk up your hair like magic!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used it for years and it never loses its effectiveness. I use the thickener gel and this before blow drying and then the web paste after my hair is dry. Nothing beats these Sebastian products and most items are $5 - 6, less than at the salon or beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free through a website called BuzzAgent, which allows you to try products.  Initially, I was very skeptical.  I mean, a spray gel, really?  However, I tried it as Sebastian is a well known company name and I was very pleased!  It gave me great volume, but it didnt make me as sticky as most gels, and it held up better than most hairsprays.  It was a great combination.  I am sure to buy this product in the future when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> Great product - de-tangles as it adds volume.</li>
    <li> Makes my fine, thin hair look like I have at least twice as much and it smells so good!.  I will be a lifetime fan.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and does add volume and shine to your hair. It is a very good product to purchase if you have thin or flat hair. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because I felt they could have used some more natural ingredients in the product.</li>
    <li> I received this product to try for free through Bzz Agent and was not sure how it would work. My hair is SO fine and thin that I thought nothing could get through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. I just spray a little on my roots and blow dry it if I want my hair straight and it definitely makes my hair appear thicker. However, if does make my roots a bit hard... but that is a small price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if I spray it on all my hair and sleep in a messy bun my hair comes out perfectly scrunched in the morning! All I have to do is take out the bun and run my fingers through my hair and head out the door. I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It gives your hair volume and body. It is also a much better price than going to a salon to buy it. Plus delivered to my door, what else could I want.</li>
    <li> I love the Spray Gel.  Adds much body to my freshly washed hair!</li>
    <li> Product is good but spray nozzle was defective so I had to transfer the liquid to another container. Ver annoying!</li>
    <li> I have fine, limp hair.  I have to keep it short otherwise it just hangs there pathetically.  I received this product for free through [...].  I was skeptical because I have used numerous \\&quot;volume boosting\\&quot; hair products, only to be disappointed.  This spray gel does work really well.  It gives my hair a lot of body and bounce.  It stays in place and also keeps it shiny and smooth. I would say I have insanely crazy volume afterwards, but it definitely makes my hair much bouncier and healthier looking.  I will definitely be buying a bottle once this one runs out.</li>
    <li> This product has a very nice smell, but it has a very weak hold.  I have fine hair and I use velcro rollers.  This product wasn&#x27;t really enough to keep my style going all day long.  I switched to a Pantene spray gel for fine hair.  Much better.</li>
    <li> I have very soft thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to give me just enough lift.</li>
    <li> My stylist had me try this &amp; I was hooked! My hair is thin &amp; fine, dry at the ends and sometimes oily at roots. I have NO volume or bounce to my hair unless I use this stuff. I do have to spray a lot of it on my hair, into my roots and comb it through, wait about 10 min and then blow dry &amp; style. For a wavy look, I spray when wet, scrunch it, &amp; let it air dry. sometimes I even pin curl it for tighter curls, I will dry them just a little on low w/ a cap on. Make sue you shake the product vigorously prior to using it to activate the product!</li>
    <li> Sebastian has done it again! Volupt Volume Building Spray is a really good hair product. Works wonders when I blow my hair. A little goes a long way. Thank you Amazon for selling it.[[ASIN:B0037IESXC Sebastian Volupt Volume Building Spray Gel Unisex, 5.07 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  leaves hair really stiff.</li>
    <li> Great product for fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> Works great. Same product I have purchased in salons</li>
    <li> I find this to be a very effective volumizing product for fine hair.</li>
    <li> It really adds volume to my hair which is thin and very fine.  Will order it again. Love Sebastian.  Yea</li>
    <li> I love that is sprays onto the hair.  makes more even distribution of the product easier.  It has great hold.</li>
    <li> I like this product Sebastian aVoluptVolume Building Spray Gel.&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist sells it for more money of course.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy for me to use and its not sticky.</li>
    <li> Love this line of products!  It smells great and truly adds volume to my hair!!  I am so glad that my hairdresser recommended it!!</li>
    <li> I tried this because I have used sebastian hair spray for years and have been very satisfied.This product was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> doesnt do anything at all. it leave the hair flat. i both all sebastian products because one of my friend recommend and none of them i like … i meant it ok but you could get something cheaper that do the same trick at target. i dont want to say the brand but google it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and buying it locally at a salon.  I was excited to save over 25% by purchasing on Amazon. Amazon you are awesome !  Keep up the great work !</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. Good smelling and easy to apply. The smell is not girly smelling but just smells good.</li>
    <li> Finally figured out a way to tell my Husband his hair gel was leaving his chestnut curls &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; ,I suggested he try my Sebastian product AND..... he now  has shiny controlled, volume without the &amp;#34;my hair is crunchy and so &amp;#34;80&#x27;s&amp;#34; separated/spiky  that you can see my scalp&amp;#34; look. My Husband is the type who never notices any product I put in his bathroom (he&#x27;d probably bathe with dish washing liquid if I let him LOL) imagine how ASTOUNDED I was when he said  &amp;#34;I really love this hair gel, honey&amp;#34;!!!!  I love how shiny  his hair looks!</li>
    <li> This product works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  My hair is very fine and limp and this spray does add volume without stiffness or stickiness.  Would recommend it and plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well, takes more product than I would like to use to achieve the desired look for me but maybe my hair is just unruly - it has a nice scent, it leaves hair feeling clean</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying the Sebastian spray gel and I really do notice more volume in my hair. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Have enjoyed this product from the start about a year and a half ago.  Love the volume, clean smell, bounce and long lasting benefit.</li>
    <li> not sticky at all. Great volume on straight hair. Easy to brush out. doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. shake before use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. One of the few that add volume without weighing down my thin hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product and was glad I could find it at a great price and did not have to run around to find it.  It gives my hair just the right amount of volume and is not sticky.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this particular product...I have used Sebastian &amp;#34;Volupt  spray gel&amp;#34; and it worked so well...This Unisex root gel does not hold a set in my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed with the results...just not the same ...I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing for my thin hair, and it&#x27;s not sticky. Love it.</li>
    <li> excellent product and at a very good price</li>
    <li> Only product that works well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy, nice volume and you can use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I am partial to spray volumizer rather than foam (an extra step with messy hands). Have been using this for a year and it offers nice lift without being too stiff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it really does add volume and help with styling and hold.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for fine hair. My hair is in a short style and it is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  It&#x27;s light on the hair and makes for great styling for the natural curly look--it&#x27;s leaves the hair flexible and soft.  The package arrived fast and was packaged well.  I would buy from the person again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all....dried my hair out completely....</li>
    <li> I have only used this a couple times since purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for more of a setting spray, but do like this also.&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t want to curl my hair I use this before blow drying, for extra&lt;br /&gt;volume, then finish with Sebastian Shaper Fierce hair spray.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Makes my hair so full and easy to manage.  In fact, it&#x27;s time to order more.</li>
    <li> Very good product...purchas experience from Amazon was fine,I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This spray doesn&#x27;t build as much volume as I had hoped but still makes my hair feel nice. It smells fantastic and I would recommend others to give it a try atleast- it may work differently on different types of hair.</li>
    <li> I buy it all the time for my short, limp and sparse hair -I spray it all over my head, dry with a large brush and I&#x27; m good to go for the whole day no matter what the day has in store for me!</li>
    <li> Keeps the hair volumized at the top-part/crown of the head and doesnt go flat. Amenable to styling with blow-drier or hot iron when sprayed on base of hair near the roots. Also doesn&#x27;t make my hair fall and is a light formula. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my very fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off because it doesn&#x27;t do as well on dry hair and also not great for tips of hair in terms on texture. Would definitely recommend this to anyone with fine hair and sensitive skin, who is looking for volume on the top and sides in particular.&lt;br /&gt;The pricing is perfect too.</li>
    <li> I use this product before I blow dry my hair.  This product gives me volume after blow-drying my fine hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well, but I still haven&#x27;t found the right product that makes my hair FEEL completely natural. Maybe I&#x27;m just asking too much for my type of hair, but I want both volume and shine.</li>
    <li> I love this gel! It is perfect for my curly, thick hair - it doesn&#x27;t make it frizzy or to plastic looking.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Only spray at the roots otherwise hair might feel little crusty. I have long hair and boy oh boy, it gives lift that I havent gotten with any other product so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts me at least 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on here is amazing. The salon charges $18</li>
    <li> Great product.  It gives you volume without being heavy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I really like the Sebastian Volupt Spray Gel because it makes my hair really soft and managable. I just wish it added more volume.</li>
    <li> Great price because you get twice the amount in this bottle compared to the smaller bottle.</li>
    <li> I have fine straight hair. If I use too much product, it lays flat. I will order it again, using mousse instead.</li>
    <li> Product is great.  Spray got \\&quot;stuck\\&quot;.  Had to move product to an old spray container I had so I could use.</li>
    <li> This volume spray gel was just...meh!  Not really anything special.  I have used Sebastian products before and thought I would just give this a try. I am not sorry I tried it, I am just not planning on buying it again because it didn&#x27;t really do anything special for me. I have lots of thin hair and I am always looking for more volume as I believe most girls are... I find the best results are with a mousse. So, it was fun to try but I will stick with the 100 or so other unused products I already have before I re-visit this product.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this Spray Gel. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have very very fine hair.. It&#x27;s really sad condition but i need to move on, so i tried this product, kinda skeptical tough. But it really give you a nice body to your hair. I&#x27;m very pleased and continued to purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty sweet. Great, low price size to &amp;#34;try it out.&amp;#34; Totally worth it! It&#x27;s a quick step I like to follow with some volumizing mousse, hairdryer, and wax for a big quiff style!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent gel if you live with a lot of humidity!  It does not weigh down the hair in any way!</li>
    <li> Best stuff for fine hair, will not make your  hair  feel  gunky, gives good volume.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair that desperately needs some texture added, but also gets weighed down and feeling dirty with other products. This works beautifully. I use a spray-in moisturizer and then this on top of wet hair and then blow dry.</li>
    <li> They sell this at my salon and this price was much better.  I like the product very much.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Gives good texture to my baby fine hair.  Gets even better when I haven&#x27;t washed in a day or two and has dry shampoo working with it as well.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in Houston; well worth ordering 4 at a time.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I find that when I use it in spurts it really works well.  I use in along with the Sebastian Volupt Shampoo and Conditioner and find that the combination does provide my fine, thin hair with a bit more volume than usual.  I cannot use this product daily, as I have an extremely sensitive scalp and it seems to irritate my scalp after several uses.  So I use it every other week for a few days in a row, and I am pleased with the results.  I did hear that Sebastian was discontinuing this product so I did buy myself an extra one to save!</li>
    <li> I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> If you want body, and curl to stay in your hair, this is the product.  However, do not use too much, as it will make your hair gummy and dull.</li>
