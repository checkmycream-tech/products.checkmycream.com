      <li>I found out from experience that a  cushy, well padded truss is not necessarily the best design to hold in an aggressive hernia.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable and effective, great for golf.  </li>
      <li>Good fit and helpful before</li>
      <li>This product is great, and the price is right.  </li>
      <li>But I never expected this to be flawless</li>
      <li>This belt is very comfortable and does the trick.</li>
      <li>I first ordered another brand truss that looked more cushy and more comfortable, but it didn&#x27;t hold the hernia in.</li>
      <li>I decided to try the Sport Aid belt because it looked more functional to me---</li>
      <li>I had many tests for the stomach problem and they all came out</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the velcro would be scratchy that way.  </li>
      <li>Patient is pleased.</li>
      <li>You can go to [...] and look up hernia truss for more information.  </li>
      <li>I have a waist size 38 and order the size medium as stated and it fits perfect with plenty adjustment left for losing this hefty gut..</li>
      <li>Second Hernia, best truss I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I read most of the reviews and don&#x27;t remember any mentioning waist length.</li>
      <li>and I doubt there are any better ones out there.</li>
      <li>I read on a medical website that trusses hold best when they are against your skin.   </li>
      <li>so I moved both pads to that side and that helped apply more pressure.</li>
      <li>Right now I think because of the size it is not doing the best it is capable of doing</li>
      <li>small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using directions in Gordon’ review (good job Gordon!) &amp; trying some adjustments, I ended getting a good fit with enough reduction of the bulge to ease the pain to almost zero.</li>
      <li>I was able to get a full workout in at the gym and the hernia remained in place!</li>
      <li>Not the most comfortable but definitely better than not having support.</li>
      <li>It seems there should be one more piece of velcro to help keep it secure.</li>
      <li>that the weather is nice outside here in this Northern climb and walking is pleasant again</li>
      <li>The velco closure makes it easy to adjust and wear.</li>
      <li>I found the hernia briefs I ordered worked perfectly, easy to put on.</li>
      <li>This truss is built like a pair of briefs and easy to put on.</li>
      <li>I have found my best solution is to place a foam pad at the site of the hole, and then just strap it down with an Ace bandage.</li>
      <li>Just read the directions for measuring for belt and youll be fine.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly, too!</li>
      <li>I mostly use it without the straps as it seems adequate with just the velcro adjustment.</li>
      <li>It was a huge help for me and my situation.</li>
      <li>I have to stand a lot in my work and this truss has made it pain free from the moment I put it on.  </li>
      <li>If you have a hernia, this is a great choice for managing the pain and discomfort and getting back to work.  </li>
      <li>Great ease  for my son&#x27;s double hernia symptoms!</li>
      <li>No way on earth to make it comfortable.</li>
      <li>one is lightweight, comfortable and does just what I need it to do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re wearing a diaper,</li>
      <li>Be sure the leg straps are not twisted.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t make this thing comfortable to wear, so I&#x27;ve gone back to the comfortable kind.</li>
      <li>I got two different types of trusses, but this one is superior.  </li>
      <li>say that the smaller size belt puts more pressure on the abdomen and holds the hernia in better.  </li>
      <li>so I was lucky to find it at a drug store on Sunday, Mother’s Day.</li>
      <li>It LOOKS great and does its job, but it&#x27;s not worth the discomfort.</li>
      <li>Pads are not very thick (&amp;#60;1/2&amp;#34;), and so do not apply pressure as much as desired... maybe with a tighter fit on waist (I am kind of between M &amp; L sizes).</li>
      <li>Looking forward to being fixed, meantime this will make you feel much better.  </li>
      <li>So I cut off the right side straps and metal fasteners.</li>
      <li>I wear it over my briefs which helps with the chafing and don&#x27;t believe it would be very comfortable against bare skin.</li>
      <li>The truss with pad fit nicely in Dockers and jeans without feeling tight.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a good belt so far, although it’s the only one I tried.</li>
      <li>periodic adjusts may be necessary based on pain level, bulge size, comfortable fit, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like it very much.  </li>
      <li>I was able to stay on my feet longer and walk further without the stinging pain of the hernia.</li>
      <li>Exercising regularly is a vital part of stress management in my life, so it was important for me to find a way to continue to exercise until I had surgery despite the hernia.  </li>
      <li>am 72 yrs old and never had any kind of a hernia problem until the last couple months.  </li>
      <li>relieving some waist strap tightness for more comfort thanks to #2’s extra pressure&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>I bought this belt based on the positive reviews and I must say that it surpassed my expectations.</li>
      <li>I still had to be careful not to worsen my tear and to make sure my parts stayed where they belonged as my rupture was very large.</li>
      <li>Nice that it has room for your \\&quot;equuipment\\&quot; to hang down</li>
      <li>I had to cut it down and sew in my own velcro, that part sucked but worked.</li>
      <li>Well made; easy to put on and take off; provides constant medium pressure when needed without noticeable discomfort.  </li>
      <li>This really helped out until I could get corrective surgery.</li>
      <li>It works very well.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately for me, the hernia was reducible---meaning it could be pushed back into the abdomen.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for sending this out to me so fast.</li>
      <li>just a guess on my part really.  </li>
      <li>Too much Velcro on the waist too</li>
      <li>HIGHLY reccomended!</li>
      <li>It is also very lightweight.</li>
      <li>So I bought one of the Sport Aid double hernia belts, removed the pad from the left side, and placed it in the right side pad holder to produce more inward pressure.</li>
      <li>Over 3 years ago I developed an inguinal  hernia in my right groin.</li>
      <li>Wish I was more careful before this happened to me !</li>
      <li>It is quite comfortable and I can wear it all day long.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The adjust able Velcros for leg straps are not very comfortable.</li>
      <li>He was completely mobile with the belt with no discomfort and was able to make his trip back to India last month comfortably and safe He is due for his surgery next month.</li>
      <li>His doctor was even surprised that we found such a valuable product as he didn&#x27;t even know there was a product like this available.</li>
      <li>It has lots of stretch built into it and will fit many different waist and hip sizes, but it must have been designed for an extremely short person because it doesn&#x27;t extend anywhere near high enough for me to wear it.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit right, waste of money</li>
      <li>highly recommend this item over all others.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>The pain has decreased significantly, and it&#x27;s making my wait for surgery more bearable.</li>

    <li> This Sportaid, Hernia Truss just just made my day. I have been using another hernia  belt and was in pain constantly. I bought two so I&#x27;d have one to wear while washing  the other. Amazon has the best price and sevice and I&#x27;m a grateful guy.</li>
    <li> This truss got me thru the wait for my surgery. I still had to be careful not to worsen my tear and to make sure my parts stayed where they belonged as my rupture was very large. It worked well for me, the only concern would be the truss is lightly built and needs to be handeled as such. While its not comfortable to wear, its not bad and I wore it all day with few problems. It was a huge help for me and my situation.</li>
    <li> Working  good  for mi father</li>
    <li> Being a person that can&#x27;t stay still, my hernia got to the point that it wouldn&#x27;t stay in without be holding it. So I scheduled my surgery and bought this truss to get me to the surgery. Shipping did take 6 days, so don&#x27;t wait until your in pain. The key to using it, is how you put it on. It has no directions, so what you do is put it on,put the belt on losely, adjust the straps that go between your legs for your height, then lay on your back so the hernia can go down. Check with your hand under the belt to make sure it is completely down and tighten the belt until the hernia is held in place, yet not to tight . You want it just tight enought to hold in the hernia. It takes some practice.  Also during the day, from moving, it may loosen up, so you need to re-adjust as the day goes on. You can go to [...] and look up hernia truss for more information.  But this pruduct alows me to be active enough to get things done, at a slower pace, don&#x27;t want to over do it. I highly recommend this product as a short term fix to get you to surgery. Get it fixed as soon as possible, hernia&#x27;s like tooth ache&#x27;s only get worst until the pain is unbearable.</li>
    <li> Got me through till surgery.</li>
    <li> Patient is pleased. ordered 2 more!! Made in U.S.A., a quality product! Shipped quickly, too!</li>
    <li> I read most of the reviews and don&#x27;t remember any mentioning waist length. Lots of them mentioned hip size rather than waist size.  I don&#x27;t see where hip size or waist size makes any difference. It has lots of stretch built into it and will fit many different waist and hip sizes, but it must have been designed for an extremely short person because it doesn&#x27;t extend anywhere near high enough for me to wear it.  Not even close! I am 6&#x27; 2\\&quot; with a 38\\&quot; waist.</li>
    <li> This is great for the price.  It works very well.  I mostly use it without the straps as it seems adequate with just the velcro adjustment.</li>
    <li> This product is great, and the price is right.  My hernia isn&#x27;t extremely big, and this truss keeps it in place all day long with no discomfort.  I do recommend using briefs instead of boxers as they help with the support.  I&#x27;ve used this under the briefs, and on the outside.  Used on the outside eliminates any chaffing.  With this I&#x27;m confident for all day long support with no fear of fruther problems, however remember that the final answer is an operation.</li>
    <li> had this several days, the leg straps come out of the buckles at the waist.The buckle end of leg strap should have some velcro  to attach it back to itself.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband . He said he loves the hernia truss. I t helps him to keep going until he has to have surgery</li>
    <li> Fit  perfectly and does the job -  I would say this is the product for a hernia ! (purchased for my husband)</li>
    <li> Over 3 years ago I developed an inguinal  hernia in my right groin. It was just a small lump back then. My doctor recommended getting it surgically repaired at the time but I foolishly waited until it got much larger and required surgery.  Exercising regularly is a vital part of stress management in my life, so it was important for me to find a way to continue to exercise until I had surgery despite the hernia.  Fortunately for me, the hernia was reducible---meaning it could be pushed back into the abdomen.  I had never used a truss before so I thought I would try one.  I first ordered another brand truss that looked more cushy and more comfortable, but it didn&#x27;t hold the hernia in. I decided to try the Sport Aid belt because it looked more functional to me---just a guess on my part really.  I was determined to try 4 or 5 different belts if that&#x27;s what it took to get the right one.  So I bought one of the Sport Aid double hernia belts, removed the pad from the left side, and placed it in the right side pad holder to produce more inward pressure. I bought a small size truss despite having a 36 inch waist line since I had read another reviewer say that the smaller size belt puts more pressure on the abdomen and holds the hernia in better.  That made sense to me.   In order to get the hernia to stay reduced when I put the truss on, I had to lay down on the bed and then push it in  first.  Then I would put the hernia belt on, arching my body upward, slipping the hernia belt under my waist, then securing it tightly.  The first time I used the truss at the gym, I wore it directly over my skin which resulted in some minor skin abrasions. But I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I was able to get a full workout in at the gym and the hernia remained in place! The second time I used it, I placed it over a pair of boxer shorts and that eliminated the abrasions---but it didn&#x27;t hold as tightly. I read on a medical website that trusses hold best when they are against your skin.   Although thistruss has the potential to produce skin abrasions if worn directly over the skin, I believe its basic and functional design results in more inward abdominal pressure at the hernia site. I found out from experience that a  cushy, well padded truss is not necessarily the best design to hold in an aggressive hernia.  I think there can be a trade-off between comfort and firm support.  I would highly recommend this belt to those individuals wanting firm and reliable support even if it means a little discomfort from the belt while being worn.</li>
    <li> After researching several products at various price points, I chose this one. I was skeptical at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure how comfortable it would be to wear, but figured that it couldn&#x27;t be worse than the hernia so I went for it. I am very happy with it because it does everything it is supposed to. As stated on the product description, it is not noticeable under everyday clothing. It is not so restrictive that you can&#x27;t sit, stand, walk, or even jog if you want to. It is also very lightweight. I recommend this product to anyone as a short-term solution to enduring a hernia - the permanent solution (my doctor tells me) being surgery.</li>
    <li> I ordered this truss for my husband a few months ago. He wears it almost every day. It holds in his hernia and allows him to function. He put off seeing the doctor, which I would not recommend, and now has a 3 to 4 month wait for surgery at the understaffed VA hospital. This truss is a godsend as it has allowed him to continue his normal activities during this long wait, when otherwise he would be incompacitated.</li>
    <li> Thanks for sending this out to me so fast. It is no fun being in this type of pain and having to work. Wish I was more careful before this happened to me !</li>
    <li> This truss works well. It was a little difficult to properly put on so thanks to the poster who put instructions on here. I have a single hernia on the left side so I moved both pads to that side and that helped apply more pressure. Overall the truss fits well and is comfortable to wear though the straps can chafe a little. I wear it over my briefs which helps with the chafing and don&#x27;t believe it would be very comfortable against bare skin. The truss is also designed so a man can urinate through the fly on your pants.</li>
    <li> I wear a 34 size in pants and th med was way to big. I had to cut it down and sew in my own velcro, that part sucked but worked. Almost lasted a year for $20.00 and avoiding surgery for now. Its not perfect but you have to cut it down in some cases. The whole idea is to avoid people knowing its there while holding the IH back from popping out. I only have a left side IH. So I cut off the right side straps and metal fasteners. I also cut the strap on the left side that goes under your leg. I cut it to short so the strap would come out of the fastener about once a day not a big deal. Most people wear a small for it to fit right unless you heavy in the pants. So I bodybuild, run, hike.....  This has no problem holding everything back an allows me to live with pain until I get the surgery which I not looking forward to.....</li>
    <li> It works as intended. As my surgery date is several months away (I live in Canada...welcome to socialized medicine) this item allows me to jog, golf, work with no discomfort.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I thought about leaving a one star, or a zero if I could. The picture for this item indicates using it in an athletic manner.  If I did that the straps which bind my equipment would strangle them.  Just getting dressed hurt.  I had to put on a pair of briefs under the truss, cause my equipment ended up sticking out the front and there is no protection from deadly straps. I can I,aging wearing this sitting around house.  But doing a sport, no,way, the straps would injure me seriously.</li>
    <li> Irritating and low quality, stiff straps, wasted money</li>
    <li> I ordered this belt and it seems to do the job but, I ordered a size to big. I will order another one size smaller and I will let you know how it feels.Right now I think because of the size it is not doing the best it is capable of doing</li>
    <li> It does fairly well, it changes the skin and I have to tug at it when I&#x27;m out in public, which is awkward.  I plan on having hernia surgery in December, I&#x27;ll tolerate it until then.</li>
    <li> Great book very light weight easy to hold and use.i think it the best of all the non apple readers</li>
    <li> I tried three different hernia support products, and this is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;The first one was so small I couldn&#x27;t wear it, and the second one is bulky, cumbersome and can&#x27;t be worn over your underwear.&lt;br /&gt;This one is lightweight, comfortable and does just what I need it to do.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item over all others.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is that the straps come loose occasionally, but it is easily readjusted, so to me it is not a problem.</li>
    <li> Only useful if you want to stand in one place.  No instructions as to washing or adjusting.  No way on earth to make it comfortable.</li>
    <li> This belt is very comfortable and does the trick. I don&#x27;t even use the straps and it keeps my hernia in place for my workouts!</li>
    <li> Has removable pads on both sides, so it will work for any combination of inguinal hernias. Nice that it has room for your \\&quot;equuipment\\&quot; to hang down so you can tend to business without removing it. Very adjustable, though the leg straps can and will chafe if they&#x27;re as tight as they should be. Be sure the leg straps are not twisted.  All in all, a good product for a bad situation.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has a hernia. It works ok, but he says it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> A truss is only a temporary fix. I can&#x27;t have surgery for my hernia for another couple of months because of other health issues I need to recover from. I first tried another manufacturer&#x27;s truss and the straps that went under my thighs left friction burns. This truss is built like a pair of briefs and easy to put on. The pads are built-in and you can throw it in the washing machine whenever it needs it. The pain has decreased significantly, and it&#x27;s making my wait for surgery more bearable.</li>
    <li> Twisted my nuts and hurt my penis</li>
    <li> 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; 35 &amp;#34; waist 42&amp;#34; hip size.  Size Medium is perfect.  Second Hernia, best truss I&#x27;ve used.  Comfortable and effective, great for golf.  Stays in place and adjusted over the stretch boxers just great.  Looking forward to being fixed, meantime this will make you feel much better.  would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This helps, I am an old person who had a failed operation 4 years ago.  At my age do not really want to go through another operation.  So, I use this when I am up and about working in the garden.  It helps.  But if you are young enough, have the operation.</li>
    <li> Velcro is not compatible with hair-bearing areas of the body. Velcro attaches to hair and pulls the skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Sturdy but lightweight garment.  Good fit and helpful before and we expect, immediately after surgery with gradual return to activities.</li>
    <li> Irritating and hard stiff straps, not worth it, wasted money</li>
    <li> Great ease  for my son&#x27;s double hernia symptoms!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a support while I do exercise or chop wood. It works well.  But the straps that go up and around either don&#x27;t hold or stay in place. It seems there should be one more piece of velcro to help keep it secure.</li>
    <li> Good quality. The size it was show. Thank you. This is a gift for a relative. And he is very pleased with this good quality product that we couldnt find in any store. We hesitated to buy it on line, but unable to find it and he needed I decided to buy it here and it was a very good choice. Thank you</li>
    <li> The sportaid helped with my husband&#x27;s discomfort!!!</li>
    <li> This product was very helpful and allowed the person wearing it the freedom to walk and move without excessive hernia pain. His doctor was even surprised that we found such a valuable product as he didn&#x27;t even know there was a product like this available.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Well-built and looks like it will last a while. Some of the reviews said it was scratchy and they couldn&#x27;t wear it.  I wonder if they are trying to wear it next to their skin instead of putting on underpants first??  I&#x27;m sure the velcro would be scratchy that way.  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the rubber pads that come with it do not &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34;.  I fixed that problem by placing a folded up handkerchief between me and the pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 72 yrs old and never had any kind of a hernia problem until the last couple months.  I think it was because of a hard bowel movement.  Surgery is not in my future plans.  I am about 30 pounds overweight which will be coming off now that the weather is nice outside here in this Northern climb and walking is pleasant again (I plan to walk about 3 mi. per day)  also will do excersises to strenghten abdominal muscles.  I have a disdain for doctors in general and surgeons in particular and would only go that route as a last resort.</li>
    <li> My father developed inguinal hernia during his 4 month visit to United States from India. He had visitor&#x27;s insurance which would not cover his operation costs. We were desperately looking for something to ease his discomfort during his stay here. I bought this belt based on the positive reviews and I must say that it surpassed my expectations. The product arrived the very next day! And it truly helped my dad. He was completely mobile with the belt with no discomfort and was able to make his trip back to India last month comfortably and safe He is due for his surgery next month. I am truly grateful for this product. It may need a little adjusting and getting used to in the beginning but it&#x27;s a godsend! Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> The velco closure makes it easy to adjust and wear. It is quite comfortable and I can wear it all day long.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to try to relieve the pain I was having from my hernia.  The straps DO NOT HOLD!  They come apart, on average, 6 times a day!  (They have already come undone 3 times this morning).  DO NOT BUY THIS!  It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
    <li> The person we sent this too would have to comment</li>
    <li> This really helped out until I could get corrective surgery. I only needed to use the right pad and not both. The truss with pad fit nicely in Dockers and jeans without feeling tight. I was able to stay on my feet longer and walk further without the stinging pain of the hernia.</li>
    <li> I use this at the gym, to stabilize my double hernia. It definitely takes some getting used to. At times there is some chafing but that can be resolved with adjusting the straps, although this is an inconvenience since I have to do this in the restroom otherwise I could attract the wrong kind of attention. But I never expected this to be flawless and I doubt there are any better ones out there.</li>
    <li> could not be used wrong item for what it was needed for</li>
    <li> I have found this uncomfortable and of no help. I wouldn&#x27;t get another one, but it may be what you need.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time to my fathers home was not what the doctor wanted for him so I need to send it back.</li>
    <li> This belt works but found to be a litte uncomfortable due to waist band being a little tall rubs on my lower bellie when sitting, no problems when standing. As with all these belts give your self some time when you need to use men&#x27;s room gettin things adjusted. Not the most comfortable but definitely better than not having support.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to put it on. Looked very uncomfortable. I found the hernia briefs I ordered worked perfectly, easy to put on.</li>
    <li> VERY uncomfortable. Straps to wide. Fastens in front leaving a bulge and lack of comfort. Can&#x27;t use it. Will not buy again!! Should be taken off sale list. One star is for prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> This belt has been a great find for me. I have an abdominal hernia that has been with me for decades. It never really bothered me until I hit age 66 and began playing pickleball. I kept feeling like the bugle was going to push out too far and I kept pushing it back while I stood on the court. After getting this brace, I don&#x27;t even know I have a hernia while I play. HIGHLY reccomended!</li>
    <li> This hernia truss works well.  I got two different types of trusses, but this one is superior.  I have to stand a lot in my work and this truss has made it pain free from the moment I put it on.  If you have a hernia, this is a great choice for managing the pain and discomfort and getting back to work.  This is making it possible for me to schedule surgery at a convenient time.</li>
    <li> Worked OK, not really for small hernias, not enough pinpoint area pressure. Too much Velcro on the waist too, so you have to do adjustments so it doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re wearing a diaper, lol.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t make this thing comfortable to wear, so I&#x27;ve gone back to the comfortable kind. It LOOKS great and does its job, but it&#x27;s not worth the discomfort.</li>
    <li> Note: This could also apply to other brand similar belt models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good belt so far, although it’s the only one I tried. I was in pain &amp; in a hurry so I was lucky to find it at a drug store on Sunday, Mother’s Day. Same price as Amazon’s here. I bought a medium which is actually too big based on the waist sizing on the pkg, I am 34”. I figured reducing it if too big than expanding one that’s too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using directions in Gordon’ review (good job Gordon!) &amp; trying some adjustments, I ended getting a good fit with enough reduction of the bulge to ease the pain to almost zero. Still hurts a little when bending at the waist. I only have the right side bulge. I did the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. wearing it over a thin pr. of boxer brief underpants to reduce the crotch straps chafing the inner thighs&lt;br /&gt;2. jamming both pads in the right pocket for extra pressure. (Other material can be used in place of the included pads; i.e. old mouse pads, small bubble packing sheets, soft polyurethane, etc).&lt;br /&gt;3. relieving some waist strap tightness for more comfort thanks to #2’s extra pressure&lt;br /&gt;4. periodic adjusts may be necessary based on pain level, bulge size, comfortable fit, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell as I only have been wearing it for a few hrs so far. I’m going to look into getting surgery very soon since the pain &amp; bulge is getting a little bigger each day since this started about a month ago. I can’t imagine wearing this for the rest of my life. Hernias run in my family. I am 67 yrs old &amp; also falling apart in other ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck you Hernians out there!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit right, waste of money</li>
    <li> If you have a need for this type product.  Watch out for strap seams though.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is serving it&#x27;s function well.  Well made; easy to put on and take off; provides constant medium pressure when needed without noticeable discomfort.  My hernia has ceased to bulge through the muscle tissue so this lighter duty truss works well for me by giving some support without the discomfort of the tighter, stronger trusses.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone who has a badly protruding bulge; I don&#x27;t believe it would provide enough support to retain such a bad bulge.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Does everything I expect it to do. But wears out a little too fast.  I bought a second one and rotate use.</li>
    <li> Waist size is the correct measurement for this belt,not hip size as other products call for. Have read lots of reviews for other belts before buying this one and seems like a lot of problems with size selection. Just read the directions for measuring for belt and youll be fine.Wow lots of drama about nothing.(imo) This belt after just puttind on for a couple of hours feels like i never had a hernia problem. I have a waist size 38 and order the size medium as stated and it fits perfect with plenty adjustment left for losing this hefty gut..lol.Dont wait until you no longer have a reductive herina before getting some support for it ,after it becomes non reductive no more options about surgery.</li>
    <li> Pads are not very thick (&amp;#60;1/2&amp;#34;), and so do not apply pressure as much as desired... maybe with a tighter fit on waist (I am kind of between M &amp; L sizes). I doubled the pads to same side (only hernia on left), and that helped matters some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjust able Velcros for leg straps are not very comfortable. Poor placement of this essentially non-adjustable Velcros (the back part of straps is REALLY where it adjusts), and these tend to rub... and Velcro does not rub nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than some I have tried... I have found my best solution is to place a foam pad at the site of the hole, and then just strap it down with an Ace bandage.</li>
    <li> I like it very much.  I&#x27;ts everything it should be.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> I have a Hernia in my lower abdoman and in the next month or so I will have it taken care of.  Recently I have encountered pain in my stomach area and decided to resolve this problem before the Hernia.  I had many tests for the stomach problem and they all came out O.K.  By&lt;br /&gt;accident I pressed on my Hernia and the stomach problem went away.  That&#x27;s when I sent away for a Hernia belt from Amazon.  Now I wear my Hernia Belt until I have my Hernia surgery and my stomach problem has not come back unless I remove the Hernia Belt.</li>
