      <li>I just used them on the pinky nails and thumb nails, they&#x27;re quite cute and well in keeping with the \\&quot;Day of the Dead\\&quot; theme.</li>
      <li>decals are really adorable.</li>
      <li>but ok.</li>
      <li>so I love</li>
      <li>The skulls are so cute</li>
      <li>I was pleased with this set.</li>
      <li>I love minis</li>
      <li>so glad i ordered this.</li>
      <li>This is probably my most favorite of all of the OPI Mini Packs.  </li>
      <li>Still better than a lot of drugstore polishes.</li>
      <li>Love the tattoos that are included.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good mini pack.</li>
      <li>i love all four colors they are so bright and vivid.</li>
      <li>The stickers aren&#x27;t her favorite, but the colors go on smooth, dry quick, and are perfect</li>
      <li>The skulls stickers are a bonus, stay on well, work great and are really pretty and vibrant</li>
      <li>The go on smooth like full-size OPIs and all are glossy.</li>
      <li>Fun and festive colors!  </li>
      <li>Overall good colors</li>
      <li>It has little decals that are easy to use AND the colors are great for summer too.</li>
      <li>Bright colors and love the little decals for your nails.</li>
      <li>the quality on the other hand is not so great.</li>
      <li>This may be a Halloween collection, but the super shiny bold shades are perfect all year round!!!  </li>
      <li>They replied back very quick and were very helpful and nice.</li>
      <li>The orange, yellow and pink are perfect for Spring and Summer.  </li>
      <li>The colors are so much fun.</li>
      <li>Always love doing special Halloween manicures, this little pack makes it easy to come up with a unique design.</li>
      <li>Cute designs on the decals but not real ellaborate as they are tiny decals meant to be able to fit on your pinky nail.</li>
      <li>They are pretty easy to apply, just get them to slide off the backing using hot water, position on nail, and then add your clear topcoat.</li>
      <li>love this set, i dont even want to open it!</li>
      <li>The colors are unusual and fun, which means they can be worn in any season.</li>
      <li>Great colors, long lasting polish.  </li>
      <li>so I applied sparingly and most of the time just did French tips</li>
      <li>The appliques are easy to handle and apply and last for longer than I was expecting (almost 2 weeks in my case).</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t use as much.</li>
      <li>The orange is a little different than most orange nail polishes out there - not quite as neon, more actual pumpkin-colored.</li>
      <li>The little bitty brushes take some getting used to, but they actually allow for nice precision</li>
      <li>The colors aren&#x27;t the most fabulous: orange, pink, black and yellow.</li>
      <li>Seller was fast, product was exactly what I had expected no issues.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a decent set for the price.</li>
      <li>Maybe they are just old, but they seemed really gooey and dried all chunky and streaky.</li>

    <li> This is probably my most favorite of all of the OPI Mini Packs.  I actually order two of them.  The colors are so much fun.</li>
    <li> Love the decals that came with these!!</li>
    <li> i love all four colors they are so bright and vivid. they are awesome and opi is a great name brand</li>

    <li> The very excellent deal and I am pleased to deal with you again, and I will recommend my friends to this product.</li>
    <li> Hate it. I heard a lot of good things about OPI and was very excited about getting this kit but the quality kinda sucks. Takes forever to dry and looks weird.</li>
    <li> Very kind sellers. They replied back very quick and were very helpful and nice. Love the mini bottles with the lovely colors! A must buy.</li>
    <li> Colors are wonderful. Brushes are very poor makes it difficult to apply without getting on skin. Love the tattoos that are included.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good mini pack. I love minis so I had to have this. The colors aren&#x27;t the most fabulous: orange, pink, black and yellow. But they are good combos for Halloween. The orange is a little different than most orange nail polishes out there - not quite as neon, more actual pumpkin-colored. The go on smooth like full-size OPIs and all are glossy. However, I have not used the nail decals yet so I cannot speak to them. They do seem to be like regular nail decals, not those horrble thick ones that won&#x27;t stay. Cute designs on the decals but not real ellaborate as they are tiny decals meant to be able to fit on your pinky nail. Cheap find for Halloween color combos, good OPI product and free decals!</li>
    <li> Great colors, long lasting polish.  The skulls stickers are a bonus, stay on well, work great and are really pretty and vibrant</li>
    <li> Bought these colors for my daughter for Halloween.  She is very pleased.  The stickers aren&#x27;t her favorite, but the colors go on smooth, dry quick, and are perfect</li>
    <li> I accidentally sent this to the wrong address. But I re ordered it and can&#x27;t wait for it to get here</li>
    <li> Fun and festive colors!  The bottles are small so I applied sparingly and most of the time just did French tips so I didn&#x27;t use as much.</li>
    <li> I thought the colors would be metallic or shimmery but they arent. The yelliw is mustard yelllw and the orange isnt a smoothie color and not a metallic its pumpkin color but I like the crazy color combination I&#x27;ll find a way to use them. Overall good colors and they&#x27;re tiny like sally&#x27;s beauty supply 99 cent nail polish.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute polish set, and has the great quality OPI polishes. The colors:&lt;br /&gt;Pink: Bright, cute&lt;br /&gt;Yellow: Bit too mustardy&lt;br /&gt;Orange: Pumpkin orange, perfect for Halloween&lt;br /&gt;Black: Good opaque color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are glossy and two coats will do quite well. The little bitty brushes take some getting used to, but they actually allow for nice precision so I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decals are really adorable. They are pretty easy to apply, just get them to slide off the backing using hot water, position on nail, and then add your clear topcoat. My decals have stayed in place for several days without a problem. They only give you enough decals to do all your fingers once, and I do wish there had been some extras. I just used them on the pinky nails and thumb nails, they&#x27;re quite cute and well in keeping with the \\&quot;Day of the Dead\\&quot; theme.</li>
    <li> The colors in this set are gorgeous...the quality on the other hand is not so great. Definitely not what I&#x27;m used to from OPI. Maybe they are just old, but they seemed really gooey and dried all chunky and streaky. And the tiny brushes are a little tricky if you&#x27;re not used to them. Overall, it&#x27;s a decent set for the price. Still better than a lot of drugstore polishes.</li>
    <li> This may be a Halloween collection, but the super shiny bold shades are perfect all year round!!!  The orange, yellow and pink are perfect for Spring and Summer.  The Black is a staple that can work at any time!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this set. The appliques are easy to handle and apply and last for longer than I was expecting (almost 2 weeks in my case). The colors are unusual and fun, which means they can be worn in any season. Good buy:)</li>
    <li> Seller was fast, product was exactly what I had expected no issues.</li>
