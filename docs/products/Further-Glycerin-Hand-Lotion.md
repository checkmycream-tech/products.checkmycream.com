      <li>more so found it here and got lotion.  </li>
      <li>Love the product but the bottles were cracked and had leaked all over box upon arrival.  </li>
      <li>And even better, it is not at all sticky nor greasy.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>and love the fact that there&#x27;s not any harmful chemical.  </li>
      <li>It is really lovely</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite hand lotion.</li>
      <li>I just love the story of how his is made and not putting bunch of synthetic ingredients on my skin.</li>
      <li>It has absolutely the best most fresh fragrance.</li>
      <li>smell-- very fresh!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s scent is bold but warm.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the kind you can keep in your car, pump once while you&#x27;re at a stop light, and have it all rubbed into your hands by the time the light turns</li>
      <li>It is fresh and kind of cucumbery.</li>
      <li>Loved it so much wanted</li>
      <li>I found this lotion at a restaurant that had it and the soap in its restroom and fell in love with the clean, grassy scent.</li>
      <li>Very light, absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Not only does it make you feel good to support this environmentally friendly business, it&#x27;s products smell AMAZING.</li>
      <li>and I appreciate the chemical free ingredients.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hands smooth without feeling sticky or oily.</li>
      <li>While I love how moisturizing this lotion is, the scent is very strong and quite masculine.</li>

      <li>It smells so fresh and warmly comforting at the same time.</li>
      <li>I have surprised two different people with it and they, too, have loved it.</li>

      <li>I first discovered this lotion at a gift shop at the car wash in San Francisco</li>
      <li>, it brings about a sense of calm and relaxation but it is overpowering and too strong to use constantly.</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t repurchase this lotion, or any of the other body care products in this line, but I think the candle would be nice as again</li>
      <li>This lotion leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
      <li>This is not a scent that is too cloying or strong but the fragrance does last.  </li>
      <li>I cannot really describe it, but i never want anything else</li>
      <li>I first encountered Further in California on a vacation.  </li>
      <li>The smell is very fresh, not sweet.</li>
      <li>co-workers frequently ask to use it when they want to relax for a moment.</li>
      <li>Your skin feels soft but not greasy.</li>
      <li>I think this is a scent most people either love or hate - no middle ground with this one.</li>
      <li>While the lotion is a little thicker than other body lotions,  it is not greasy at all and absorbs quickly.</li>

    <li> love it!  and love the fact that there&#x27;s not any harmful chemical.  Love the scent!  Wished it was a bit less expensive...maybe $12 would be a good price point.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works well too.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Further soap but, I wasn&#x27;t in need of hand lotion. Do men use hand lotion? I was given a sample and it&#x27;s a very good product. This product also appears to contain a large amount of vegetable glycerine which requires less; therefore, the product last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Further hand lotion is incredible - the scent is the perfect balance of earthy femininity - it&#x27;s scent is bold but warm.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Further.  I use the hand soap as well.  It is really lovely and I appreciate the chemical free ingredients.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great lotion with a fantastic scent!</li>
    <li> I found this lotion at a restaurant that had it and the soap in its restroom and fell in love with the clean, grassy scent. The lotion moisturizers wonderfully without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product for a friend in candle form.  One day, I was at her home visiting, and kept smelling something wonderful...Alas, it was the \\&quot;Further\\&quot; candle!  I went back to the store to purchase one for myself, and of course they were all sold out.  The lotion was sitting there, and I used some before I left the store empty handed.  For the rest of the day, I kept smelling this wonderful scent, clean and fresh, and knew I needed this lotion.  I searched online and found the products through Amazon!!!!  What a treat.  Go ahead, treat yourself!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell and feel of this lotion! My bf loves it too, not too girlie of a smell at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years since I discovered it in a restaurant bathroom. I have started giving it to my friends as gifts. It smells so fresh and warmly comforting at the same time. Leaves my hands smooth without feeling sticky or oily.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful.  It has absolutely the best most fresh fragrance. And even better, it is not at all sticky nor greasy.  Very light, absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s the kind you can keep in your car, pump once while you&#x27;re at a stop light, and have it all rubbed into your hands by the time the light turns green- and it won&#x27;t make your steering wheel slippery. I will never buy another kind of lotion again.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday.  It is safe to use, smells good and feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again from you or from the company.</li>
    <li> While I love how moisturizing this lotion is, the scent is very strong and quite masculine. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the scent, it brings about a sense of calm and relaxation but it is overpowering and too strong to use constantly. I think this is a scent most people either love or hate - no middle ground with this one. This scent also clashed horribly with all of my perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t repurchase this lotion, or any of the other body care products in this line, but I think the candle would be nice as again the scent is reminiscent of a spa.</li>
    <li> Help the environment while you slather this delicious smelling lotion on your body. This product is taken from locally sourced depleted vegetable oil, refined into biofuel and then converted into glycerin lotion. Your skin feels soft but not greasy. The smell is very fresh, not sweet.</li>
    <li> Found this product in a restaurant in Ashevile bathroom and bought the soap.  Loved it so much wanted more so found it here and got lotion.  Slight fragrance but not too string.  I just love the story of how his is made and not putting bunch of synthetic ingredients on my skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Smells great feels even better on! Thank you</li>
    <li> I first discovered this lotion at a gift shop at the car wash in San Francisco and I started buying it and then one day I went there and it was discontinued. So I went online. I ordered three. Bottles. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Love the product but the bottles were cracked and had leaked all over box upon arrival.  Great smell-- very fresh!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite hand lotion. I have surprised two different people with it and they, too, have loved it. I absolutely love the fragrance. It is fresh and kind of cucumbery. I cannot really describe it, but i never want anything else but this!!</li>
    <li> I have the lotion and soap. Feels good and best of all smells really good!</li>
    <li> Very light and relaxing scent. I keep it at my desk and co-workers frequently ask to use it when they want to relax for a moment.</li>
