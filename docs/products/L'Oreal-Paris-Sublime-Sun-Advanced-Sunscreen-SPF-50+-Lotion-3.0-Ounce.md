      <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I LOVE it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also wrecks havoc on any makeup you try to put on top of it.</li>
      <li>I am from the mid-west and this trip was in the middle of winter and on top of that I have very fair skin.</li>
      <li>and I achieved a nice golden tan with NO burning.</li>
      <li>I was trying to find a good face lotion with high SPF to use on a vacation to Hawaii.</li>
      <li>No wonder it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>: Not sticky, moisturizing with light fragrance, lots of product,&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I like the Neutrogena sunscreen better for my skin type because it isn&#x27;t as oily as this one and is better for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;(1) Easy to apply and QUICKLY absorbed into skin!&lt;br /&gt;(2)</li>
      <li>IS my new sunscreen! :-)</li>
      <li>it is long-lasting, very water-resistant, easy to apply, and protects well against both UVA and UVB</li>
      <li>Appeared right near the top of the list when I asked for tinosorb sucscreens.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t burn the whole trip and this lotion went on very nicely, didn&#x27;t feel heavy and had a light smell.</li>
      <li>Worked pretty well for me and will be using again</li>
      <li>and I think it is a better sunscreen than the higher-end sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried (more effective than Shisheido Ultimate Sun Protection Lotion SPF 60 PA+++ and Shisheido Urban Environment Oil-Free UV Protector SPF 42, and less sticky than Ole Henriksen protect the trutch SPF 50</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s hard to describe it but isn&#x27;t a pleasant sensation.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the tube will last very long as I used a fair amount just to cover my arms.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen goes on very well and is not that greasy.  </li>
      <li>is very affordable.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced for the quality it is.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite sunscreen for my body as it works well as far as sun protection, and is moisturizing at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to most sunscreens and this is the first one I have found that applies easily, is not greasy, does not sting the eyes, does not make my face break out and feels as though there is nothing on the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m generally pretty picky about my sunscreens since my skin is sensitive</li>
      <li>but has a slightly less sunscreen-y feel and smell, and gets a much better score from the Environmental Working Group in terms of not containing high concentrations of toxic chemicals (4 vs 7).&lt;br</li>
      <li>You would think since it&#x27;s made by L&#x27;Oreal that it would be okay for everyday use, but I wouldn&#x27;t wear this unless I was going to the pool.</li>
      <li>When you first squirt it out, it smells and looks exactly like the $3 big bottle of sunscreen from your local drugstore.</li>
      <li>Blue Lizard Australian Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 is the one, even when it reads on the label Daily Moisturizer believe me isn&#x27;t greasy at all, I&#x27;ve been using this product with a light moisturizer under and is the right moisture my skin is needing to start the day</li>
      <li>This was old and not even new.  </li>
      <li>, I rub a pea size portion and it gets completely absorb into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Skin feels soft and</li>
      <li>This was so old it did not even have a smell to it.</li>
      <li>This is an old product that is no longer carried by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s something else, every time I applied this product on my face besides the greasy feeling my skin got like too sensitive</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s something in this product that affects my skin exposing or leaving it sensitive</li>
      <li>It arrived with an old faded bar code and sticker residue from a sticker that had been removed from the front.  </li>
      <li>it comes out fast so be careful.</li>
      <li>It is very greasy and it did not last very long at all.  </li>
      <li>This L&#x27;Oreal product felt heavier than expected, and I didn&#x27;t feel like it was absorbed as well as the other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m generally pretty picky about my sunscreens since my skin is sensitive and I want to make sure I have good coverage. I&#x27;ve used the Neutrogena sunscreen for awhile, but it tends to be a little heavy, so I went ahead and gave this one a try. I used this on my body and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Not sticky, moisturizing with light fragrance, lots of product,&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Heavy especially on the face under makeup, doesn&#x27;t absorb on skin very well, a little oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the Neutrogena sunscreen better for my skin type because it isn&#x27;t as oily as this one and is better for sensitive skin. This L&#x27;Oreal product felt heavier than expected, and I didn&#x27;t feel like it was absorbed as well as the other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Its says SPF 50 but the one that arrived was SPF 30.</li>
    <li> Just did not suit my skin..caused rashes....</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen for my body as it works well as far as sun protection, and is moisturizing at the same time.  I prefer another brand for my face.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is a bit different than I expected based on the same brand I&#x27;d purchased specifically for my face. It takes a while to rub it in (it comes out white and thick)and it comes out fast so be careful. Once rubbed in, it seemed greasy, but once it dries it isn&#x27;t greasy or thick so I like it. I don&#x27;t think the tube will last very long as I used a fair amount just to cover my arms.</li>
    <li> Just tried this sunscreen and I am BLOWN AWAY! Had been using Neutrogenia Ultra Sheer line as well as their Age Face Shield and decided to give Sublime Sun a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I LOVE it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Easy to apply and QUICKLY absorbed into skin!&lt;br /&gt;(2) Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with a white film like the Neutrogenia creams do.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Skin feels soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;(4) No \\&quot;Yes, I am wearing sunscreen\\&quot; odor!&lt;br /&gt;(5) Lasts ALL DAY sunning in the pool. I am fair skinned and I achieved a nice golden tan with NO burning. Only applied ONCE but spent all afternoon in the sun/pool.&lt;br /&gt;(6) Doesn&#x27;t leave a white mess on the pool floats and our deck furniture.&lt;br /&gt;(7) Doesn&#x27;t stain my bikini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This IS my new sunscreen! :-)</li>
    <li> The tube of sunscreen was open and unsealed.  It also had the slight smell or cigarette smoke, yuck!  Used sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Thought it was going to have tinosorb in it.  Appeared right near the top of the list when I asked for tinosorb sucscreens.  Didn&#x27;t list the ingredients in the info.  I think this is false advertising. Nothing you couldn&#x27;t buy in your local drug store.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen goes on very well and is not that greasy.  I ordered the SPF 50 because I wanted the added coverage, living in Southern Arizona.  The SPF 30 also works well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Awful. You would think since it&#x27;s made by L&#x27;Oreal that it would be okay for everyday use, but I wouldn&#x27;t wear this unless I was going to the pool. When you first squirt it out, it smells and looks exactly like the $3 big bottle of sunscreen from your local drugstore. It&#x27;s greasy, smells like sunscreen, and STAYS greasy on your skin. Do not buy this unless it is to take to the pool with you. It also wrecks havoc on any makeup you try to put on top of it. No wonder it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that is gives your skin a shine and it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
    <li> it has a nice light creamy texture. it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your clothes and it does protect from the sun.</li>
    <li> This was old and not even new.  It arrived with an old faded bar code and sticker residue from a sticker that had been removed from the front.  FFF---.  I should have sent it back for a refund.  It went in the trash!!!  The worst experience ever on Amazon.  My only complaint ever on here.  This was so old it did not even have a smell to it.</li>
    <li> its not greasy like I thought it might be having to use it every day.  dermatologist said it was a good product too.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a good face lotion with high SPF to use on a vacation to Hawaii. I am from the mid-west and this trip was in the middle of winter and on top of that I have very fair skin. This face lotion was great! I didn&#x27;t burn the whole trip and this lotion went on very nicely, didn&#x27;t feel heavy and had a light smell. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I like the way this lotion feels on my skin, but I have not tested enough in the sun to  know its performance as a sun screen.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen. It is as effective as Coppertone and Banana Boat&#x27;s 50 SPF sport suncreens- it is long-lasting, very water-resistant, easy to apply, and protects well against both UVA and UVB rays- but has a slightly less sunscreen-y feel and smell, and gets a much better score from the Environmental Working Group in terms of not containing high concentrations of toxic chemicals (4 vs 7).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit more expensive, but the sale price isn&#x27;t bad (I bought it at Harris Teeter on sale from $10.99 to $7.99, with a $1 off paper coupon and a $1.00 off e-vic electronic coupon so it came to $5.99) and I think it is a better sunscreen than the higher-end sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried (more effective than Shisheido Ultimate Sun Protection Lotion SPF 60 PA+++ and Shisheido Urban Environment Oil-Free UV Protector SPF 42, and less sticky than Ole Henriksen protect the trutch SPF 50+ and Supergoop! SPF 30+).</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on an article is WH magazine.  This product was not worth the money.  It is very thick and greasy,  12 hours after I put it on I can still slide objects down my arm like a slippery slide.  Save your money and buy any product but this one.</li>
    <li> Bought a few tubes of this pre-vacation. Arrived quickly and very nicely packaged. Worked wonderfully and no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> This is an old product that is no longer carried by L&#x27;Oreal. No expiration date on the tube (no box). Sunscreens have a limited life, usually two years after mfg date. But there is no way to know what that date is and there is no &amp;#34;use by&amp;#34; information so the product is useless. Sunscreen&#x27;s only purpose is to help prevent skin cancer - why on earth would you lather this on if you were not assured it would do that!&lt;br /&gt;PS - Don&#x27;t bother calling the 800 number written on the label. You just get an arbitrary &amp;#34;should be good&amp;#34; response by someone who knows nothing about the product, product codes, etc. You get this no-service after being on hold for a half-hour or so. Bad L&#x27;Oreal!!</li>
    <li> the product does not work for going to work or out on the town. It is very fatty.</li>
    <li> Really outstanding product!  Helped my skin while protecting it from sun damage.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have used this on a regular basis &amp; truly like it. This product works great to protect you from the sun.</li>
    <li> I bought this product by reading all those good reviews (the one rated with one star wasn&#x27;t there at that time) this product is so greasy, even when my skin is dry, this product leaves my face like instead sunscreen was oil what I did apply to my face, the feeling is so uncomfortable considering that I live on South Florida. There&#x27;s something else, every time I applied this product on my face besides the greasy feeling my skin got like too sensitive it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s something in this product that affects my skin exposing or leaving it sensitive, it&#x27;s hard to describe it but isn&#x27;t a pleasant sensation. I am going to use the remaining of this product on my arms or someplace else but even on my arms it will feel like too oily I bet. Don&#x27;t recommend this product, if you are looking for a good face sunscreen Blue Lizard Australian Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 is the one, even when it reads on the label Daily Moisturizer believe me isn&#x27;t greasy at all, I&#x27;ve been using this product with a light moisturizer under and is the right moisture my skin is needing to start the day, I rub a pea size portion and it gets completely absorb into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product two stars because it&#x27;s price is very affordable.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all! Feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most sunscreens and this is the first one I have found that applies easily, is not greasy, does not sting the eyes, does not make my face break out and feels as though there is nothing on the skin. I work outside all day and have tried (literally!) every sunscreen on the market due to my acquired extreme sun sensitivity and prediliction for pre-cancerous lesions. This product is the best ever. Thank you L&#x27;Oreal!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It is very greasy and it did not last very long at all.  I burned after only 30 minutes in the sun.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well for me and will be using again</li>
    <li> This item is so good and perfect brand .&lt;br /&gt;so nice and good item.&lt;br /&gt;I wiil be recomended for my friends.</li>
    <li> Very good sunscreen, doesn&#x27;t burn me and it stays one. Reasonably priced for the quality it is. I have very fair skin and it works well with my skintone.</li>
