### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>its the best lip balm i have ever used!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best tinted lip gloss thats ever been on the market.</li>
      <li>This one is great!  </li>
      <li>If all you&#x27;re wanting is a hint of color, then this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for summer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and</li>
      <li>The color is good and this has excellent EWG rating (enviornmental working group-great site to see what products are safe).&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
      <li>It was perfect, and I loved that it also had SPF 15.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like Burts Bees because the colors aren&#x27;t great and they slide of my lips.</li>
      <li>Great neutral color.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with both the Blaze and Garnet lip balms.</li>
      <li>If you want a lip balm with a mineral sunscreen, not a chemical one, this is a great choice.  </li>
      <li>This lip balm is a great alternative.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, minty smell.</li>
      <li>It also tastes good.  </li>
      <li>Then it goes on top of it beautifully.</li>
      <li>free from all harmful chemicals like paraben, still UV protective, moisturize the lips so well and color&#x27;s gorgeous!</li>
      <li>Love the color!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
      <li>just love it!</li>
      <li>My favorite lip balm of all time!</li>
      <li>its own, Blaze has a pink-red tone on me and is a lighter color.</li>
      <li>Looks nice on.</li>
      <li>so I thought Blaze would be a nice addition.</li>
      <li>The Alba Terratints have been redone and because I liked the product before it was revised</li>
      <li>The great thing is that even with 3-4 coats on, the feeling and texture of this lip balm didn&#x27;t change significantly.</li>
      <li>Beautiful natural burnished color that looks great with my complexion.  </li>
      <li>I find the scent of peppermint very strong, but I am hypersensitive to odors</li>
      <li>side is that the color looks nice :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking all over for a lip balm with a very light hint of color-and this isn&#x27;t it either.</li>
      <li>You can control the strength of the color based on how many coats you apply.</li>
      <li>(This is my longwinded effort to help you figure out which color would be better for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Someone with paler lips would need fewer coats and notice a greater difference.</li>
      <li>I can wear most darker colors.</li>
      <li>I have this in the color Bloom and love it...</li>
      <li>More like chapstick than a lip balm, but I still like it.</li>
      <li>This does not glide smoothly at all and the colour was not so nice.</li>
      <li>top it all off,</li>
      <li>In theory the color is lovely though.</li>
      <li>This lip balm is cruelty-free, vegetarian (it does contain certified organic beeswax), and has no nasty chemicals, like parabens or phthalates.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the color of Blaze.</li>
      <li>I used to love Terra tints in the Blaze color.  </li>
      <li>Ok..I like burts bees better</li>
      <li>However, I do wish it was more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Very good Alba Botanica Lip Balm SPF 15 at low price.&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
      <li>If you are very sensitive or your lips are already burned, you many not find this pleasant.</li>
      <li>Once rancid oil gets stuck in plastic, you will never be able to remove it and no matter how  clean</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
      <li>so I won&#x27;t run out because it isn&#x27;t that easy to find in stores.</li>
      <li>I have medium skin tone, tan easily, and am covered in freckles.</li>
      <li>Bloom is smooth, scent free and adds a nice wash of color all with zinc for SPF - which I really like because it is a better option vs the chemical sunscreens and since odds are I am ingesting most of what is on my lips I&#x27;d rather avoid the chemical sunscreens.</li>
      <li>Nice tint but pretty waxy.</li>
      <li>My lips are often dry/chapped but this has kept them looking good, so I&#x27;m a new fan of this brand.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I enjoy the scent of peppermint.</li>
      <li>it gives my lips and the smooth application.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as smooth as it could be.</li>
      <li>My lips have a good amount of color to them naturally.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re familiar with Burt&#x27;s Bees lip</li>
      <li>Love this color and love that it&#x27;s natural!</li>
      <li>:) definitely going to buy more!</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor and clean up your manufacturing process.  </li>
      <li>This brand is a good compromise, and don&#x27;t let the RED scare you...</li>
      <li>My skin tone does well with blue-reds and true reds.</li>
      <li>Lightly minty with a pretty color on the lip.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a vivid red based on the packaging, but it&#x27;s more like a warm rust, which looks very flattering on my light-olive skin tone.</li>
      <li>This is definitely a warm red, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have cool undertones to your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(this balm is a teensy bit hard and could use a little more oil to soften it up) of the Neutrogena tint better, but will happily stop using it in favor of this lip balm!</li>
      <li>A nice shade of red.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do the tinting like it should either, like i said it kind of left a blotchy color instead.</li>
      <li>You are either using rancid oil, in which case you need to throw it away and buy some fresh oil and keep it refrigerated</li>
      <li>Got this to replace some of the same kind that I&#x27;d gotten as  gift about 10 years ago and used up.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The two colors look slightly different in the tube but have a more significant difference on my lips.</li>
      <li>Blaze is right for my darker lips.</li>
      <li>This balm is nourishing and provides just the right amount of color.  </li>
      <li>Second reason why I love this is that the reddish pink is perfect on my skin tone, I have light colored Irish skin with strawberry red hair and light aqua eyes.</li>
      <li>This one has the same color, but is slimy compared to the old one I loved.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice, sheer tint, decent peppermint flavor, and SPF.</li>
      <li>Love the entire balm.</li>
      <li>Maybe a different color would be better</li>
      <li>Garnet is a stronger, darker color and is more of a brownish red.</li>
      <li>I might as well keep my regular lip balm which does not irritate my lips and put lipstick on top</li>
      <li>To top it off, it made a HUGE mess just trying this on my lips for the first/last time.</li>
      <li>With a history a skin cancer on both sides of the family, having grown up in a warm and sunny, climate, and the amount of sun damage done to my skin already, I need good, safe sunscreen options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Alba Botanica TerraTints SPF 15 Lip Balm here in Blaze and elsewhere in Garnet (at the time I ordered, Amazon was not supplying Garnet directly and the reviews on it were quite bad based on people receiving expired product).</li>
      <li>I can easily get away with clear lip gloss only and look like I&#x27;m wearing one with some light colored.</li>
      <li>They go on smoothly and easily, like a typical, good-quality lip balm.</li>
      <li>I also like that it&#x27;s packaged like a regular lip balm, as I found it easy to apply without a mirror.</li>
      <li>I have the bloom color which is a little light for me, but it has a pepermint, cooling, smooth smell and texture.</li>
      <li>the color is great if you just want a little red and you can reapply a few more times for a more intense strawberry red.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I know this stuff was cheap, but don&#x27;t throw away your money on this total loser from Alba!!</li>
      <li>My whole mouth tastes like melted plastic.</li>
      <li>I also love that it never really dries out on my lips.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very creamy, like a high-quality lip balm that just happens to have pigment in it.</li>
      <li>As if it was really old/stale.</li>
      <li>It was kind of like an uneven rusty color getting smeared on my lips.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear very light colors or very pink colors</li>
      <li>The reason why I buy this is because most other brands chap my lips.</li>
      <li>found the color to quite noticeable--certainly not like a highly pigmented lipstick, but definitely enough to make a significant difference.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over for a lip balm with a very light hint of color-and this isn&#x27;t it either. Probably more translucent than actual lipstick, but not much. Too dark for everyday for my pale skin. In theory the color is lovely though.</li>
    <li> Love the color! Love the entire balm. Really long lasting color. However, I do wish it was more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Nice tint but pretty waxy. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Not a fan, the texture feels dry and the scent have an artificial/plastic-y tone to it.&lt;br /&gt;Plus side is that the color looks nice :)</li>
    <li> Softens lips. Great neutral color. Does not bleed outside lip line.  Will to continue to buy. Great product.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible, no noticeable tint, I couldn&#x27;t tolerate it long enough to leave it on so I can&#x27;t speak of the actual moisturizing ability thus the 2 stars. Maybe it works great but the smell alone turned me off so bad it went straight into the trash.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a replacement for my usual lipstick, which tended to horribly dry out my lips. Thankfully, I think I&#x27;ve found it! I was expecting more of a vivid red based on the packaging, but it&#x27;s more like a warm rust, which looks very flattering on my light-olive skin tone. I got quite a few compliments on the color! This is definitely a warm red, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have cool undertones to your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the color to quite noticeable--certainly not like a highly pigmented lipstick, but definitely enough to make a significant difference. I didn&#x27;t find it particularly sheer, as when I apply it I generally go over my lips twice. I also love that it never really dries out on my lips. It&#x27;s very creamy, like a high-quality lip balm that just happens to have pigment in it. I also like that it&#x27;s packaged like a regular lip balm, as I found it easy to apply without a mirror.</li>
    <li> The Alba Terratints have been redone and because I liked the product before it was revised I ordered&lt;br /&gt;four of these balms because the picture was of the previous product.  Unfortunately, I received the&lt;br /&gt;the new product.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Lightly minty with a pretty color on the lip.</li>
    <li> I love the idea but way too thick and streaky</li>
    <li> Some tinted lip balms don&#x27;t moisturize at all.  Others don&#x27;t have enough color.  This brand is a good compromise, and don&#x27;t let the RED scare you...it&#x27;s not overly red on your lips.</li>
    <li> Stays on forever and lips WILL NOT BURN due to the all-natural zinc. This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever had that could hold up to a full beach week of 8+ hours/day in the sun.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm of all time! I don&#x27;t like Burts Bees because the colors aren&#x27;t great and they slide of my lips. Maybe this balm is a bit pasty but I always use a clear waxy lip balm before I use this,so the color not only glides on but also has something to adhere to. Then it goes on top of it beautifully. The reason why I buy this is because most other brands chap my lips. I might have some sort of allergy to lipsticks and I have used every brand with the same results from Chanel to Clinique and everything inbetween. Second reason why I love this is that the reddish pink is perfect on my skin tone, I have light colored Irish skin with strawberry red hair and light aqua eyes. If you have the same problems that I have with lipsticks I would highly suggest that you try this brand in this color.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace some of the same kind that I&#x27;d gotten as  gift about 10 years ago and used up.  This one has the same color, but is slimy compared to the old one I loved.  It ends up smearing off on glasses when I go out instead of staying put like the old product did.  I&#x27;ll use it, but won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t totally stoked on this. Maybe a different color would be better but I&#x27;m not sure. It was kind of like an uneven rusty color getting smeared on my lips. No better than any cheap chapstick. It didn&#x27;t do the tinting like it should either, like i said it kind of left a blotchy color instead. Just not impressed even though I LOVE Alba and could rave about so many other of their hair, soap and facial products and use so many faithfully.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a Chapstick with a non-chemical sunblock in it.  This one is great!  The tint of color is pretty subtle, my lips are protected from the sun, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about licking my lips and ingesting weird chemical sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Love this color and love that it&#x27;s natural!</li>
    <li> This lip balm delivers what it promises.  It&#x27;s plant-based and has no harsh chemicals.  The product came well-packaged and promptly as well.  I&#x27;ve already introduced it to friends and family along with other organic and plant-based make-up that I&#x27;ve been trying over time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very about the kind of chemicals I am putting in/on my body and sunscreen is a tough one. Studies are showing that most of the chemicals in sunscreen are just as, if not more, dangerous as UVA/B rays themselves. With a history a skin cancer on both sides of the family, having grown up in a warm and sunny, climate, and the amount of sun damage done to my skin already, I need good, safe sunscreen options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Alba Botanica TerraTints SPF 15 Lip Balm here in Blaze and elsewhere in Garnet (at the time I ordered, Amazon was not supplying Garnet directly and the reviews on it were quite bad based on people receiving expired product). This lip balm is cruelty-free, vegetarian (it does contain certified organic beeswax), and has no nasty chemicals, like parabens or phthalates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with both the Blaze and Garnet lip balms. They go on smoothly and easily, like a typical, good-quality lip balm. They feel lightweight and do not have that heavy, waxy, Chapsticky texture that some products do. Both feel moisturizing, which is not surprising based on some of the ingredients, and did not leave my lips feeling dry once they wore off. The peppermint oil in this lip balm causes a slight tingle on my lips, which I enjoy. If you are very sensitive or your lips are already burned, you many not find this pleasant. I find the scent of peppermint very strong, but I am hypersensitive to odors so it will probably be milder for others. Fortunately, I enjoy the scent of peppermint. It even helps clear my sinuses a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two colors look slightly different in the tube but have a more significant difference on my lips. I have medium skin tone, tan easily, and am covered in freckles. My lips have a good amount of color to them naturally. I can easily get away with clear lip gloss only and look like I&#x27;m wearing one with some light colored. I can wear most darker colors. My skin tone does well with blue-reds and true reds. I don&#x27;t wear very light colors or very pink colors well. (This is my longwinded effort to help you figure out which color would be better for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On its own, Blaze has a pink-red tone on me and is a lighter color. Garnet is a stronger, darker color and is more of a brownish red. Prior to ordering, I had a sense Garnet would be the better color for me, but I ordered Blaze based on the reason I mentioned above and I expected it would work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both colors are very pale, barely there, when first applied. You can control the strength of the color based on how many coats you apply. It took probably 3-4 coats for me to feel like I had enough color with both. Even at that point, Blaze was quite a bit lighter on me than Garnet. Someone with paler lips would need fewer coats and notice a greater difference. The great thing is that even with 3-4 coats on, the feeling and texture of this lip balm didn&#x27;t change significantly. It still felt lightweight and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it all off, these contain zinc oxide as sunscreen, instead of icky chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and both Blaze and Garnet suit me well. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for. It gives a little hint of natural color and moisture. Perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> I just wasnt fond of the tint. Mind you it actually looks natural on me, just feel meh about it. I feel the formula sat on my lips rather than moisturized, if that makes sense.</li>
    <li> The color is good and this has excellent EWG rating (enviornmental working group-great site to see what products are safe).&lt;br /&gt;However it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize well and my lips were dry after applying this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to replace my Neutrogena Lip Tint - I hated using a product that was tested on animals. This lip balm is a great alternative. It has a nice, sheer tint, decent peppermint flavor, and SPF. I like the color, flavor, and consistency (this balm is a teensy bit hard and could use a little more oil to soften it up) of the Neutrogena tint better, but will happily stop using it in favor of this lip balm!</li>
    <li> I wanted an SPF lip product that used sun block not chemicals. This was one of the few I found, and it doesn&#x27;t turn my lips white. A nice shade of red. It appears to work well.</li>
    <li> Smells like rancid lip balm</li>
    <li> Very good Alba Botanica Lip Balm SPF 15 at low price.&lt;br /&gt;Con: very dark tint, lighter color not available.</li>
    <li> If all you&#x27;re wanting is a hint of color, then this is perfect.  I LOOOOVE the Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm in Dahlia, but it&#x27;s so stinking expensive!! I was expecting this to be more of a raisiny brick red, but it&#x27;s a little pinker than I was expecting.  NOT pink, just a little more than I had in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re familiar with Burt&#x27;s Bees lip shimmer in fig or their lip balm in Dahlia, this is similar but barely pinker and without shimmer.</li>
    <li> I used to love Terra tints in the Blaze color.  It provided a nice even color, without being thick and gloppy like lipstick.  However, they must have changed the formula, because I just received a new order of 4 different tubes and it&#x27;s not the same.  The color is minimal and uneven, and really not much darker than untinted chapstick.  I&#x27;m so disappointed that it changed :(</li>
    <li> I like the natural lip color look it gives my lips and the smooth application.  I also can use it as a lip moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This does not glide smoothly at all and the colour was not so nice.</li>
    <li> There are other lip balms made by Alba Botanica that I love, but this product is much to clumpy, almost gritty. I have to wipe my lips after each application which is disappointing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! its the best lip balm i have ever used! the color is great if you just want a little red and you can reapply a few more times for a more intense strawberry red. :) definitely going to buy more!</li>
    <li> Tasted like minerals, yuck!</li>
    <li> Ok..I like burts bees better</li>
    <li> just love it! free from all harmful chemicals like paraben, still UV protective, moisturize the lips so well and color&#x27;s gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Beautiful natural burnished color that looks great with my complexion.  More like chapstick than a lip balm, but I still like it.</li>
    <li> I like the color,  I like that you can layer it.  But i dont like how it feels,  sort of grainy and not soft.</li>
    <li> Looks nice on. It is red / pink but barely there. It tastes and smells minty. It is long lasting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new lip balm that keeps my lips hydrated but also adds a bit of color. I previously used Burts Bees but my lips were still dry afterwards. I wanted an organic brand so I decided to try Alba Botanica and the Blaze mineral tinted balm (the SPF is a bonus). I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks now and I like it a lot. It has a pleasant, minty smell. It&#x27;s not a glossy balm at all; the texture is thicker and earthy. I have tan skin and the Blaze tint comes out subtle on my naturally red lips, but I think it enhances the color in a nice way. My test for all balms is to see how my lips hold up at the end of the night/the next morning, and this passed! My lips are often dry/chapped but this has kept them looking good, so I&#x27;m a new fan of this brand.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other reviews.  I thought maybe the stinky smell other people complained about might be something else but no - it is definitely rancid oil..  Alba Botanica: Do yourself a favor and clean up your manufacturing process.  You are either using rancid oil, in which case you need to throw it away and buy some fresh oil and keep it refrigerated OR you need to get new molds or vats for mixing/molding your product.  Once rancid oil gets stuck in plastic, you will never be able to remove it and no matter how  clean you think your containers are trace amounts of the rancid oil can still ruin your product.  Get yourself some glass or metal molds/mixers which can be cleaned of rancid oil.  Good luck and too bad because tinted lip balm with natural spf is hard to come by.  Stop selling this leftover garbage and start over.</li>
    <li> Smell is awful! I have this in the color Bloom and love it...so I thought Blaze would be a nice addition. Well, the color Blaze is nice, redish hue, but it the tube I rcvd smells awful! As if it was really old/stale. Many others complain of this as well, which is too bad because I am not sure if the seller is selling old/poorly stored product or if something they do to the Blaze color makes it smell. I assume the former because the Bloom I have in my purse and use quite often. Bloom is smooth, scent free and adds a nice wash of color all with zinc for SPF - which I really like because it is a better option vs the chemical sunscreens and since odds are I am ingesting most of what is on my lips I&#x27;d rather avoid the chemical sunscreens. I&amp;#34;ll continue to use the Bloom and maybe I&#x27;ll try blaze again from a different seller in the future but the tube I rcv&#x27;d is just terrible. I put it on and tried ignore it but not only did it make my nauseated but my friend who was sitting close to me in the car smelled it. It&#x27;s awful!</li>
    <li> This balm is nourishing and provides just the right amount of color.  If you have pink lips, you might want to try the lighter shade.  Blaze is right for my darker lips.</li>
    <li> As soon as I used it, I bought an extra. I love the color of Blaze. It&#x27;s not dark unless you want it to be and apply heavily. It isn&#x27;t as smooth as it could be.</li>
    <li> If you want a lip balm with a mineral sunscreen, not a chemical one, this is a great choice.  I had been looking for a chap stick that would protect my lips from the sun and came upon this one at a health store.  An added bonus, is that it has a tint (blaze) so I wear it in place of lip stick.  I like the sheer color because it looks natural but yet gives a little color so the lips don&#x27;t look so pale.  It also tastes good.  If you don&#x27;t want the color, this brand makes another lighter color which does not show.  I put it on auto order so I won&#x27;t run out because it isn&#x27;t that easy to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Alba Botanica Terratints for years.  They&#x27;re not easy to find in retail stores here, so I resorted to ordering the product online.  I like that it&#x27;s easy to use, you don&#x27;t need a mirror, the color it imparts to your lips is just enough.  I&#x27;m a long-time fan!</li>
    <li> It irritated my lips and it has this horrible minty taste. Also the color is barely visible, which is some prefer, but for me I can&#x27;t see a difference.. I might as well keep my regular lip balm which does not irritate my lips and put lipstick on top</li>
    <li> I have been using Alba Botanica TerraTints in Blaze for almost five years exclusively. Once I became pregnant and started nursing, I stopped wearing all makeup except a little eyeliner and this lip balm. It was perfect, and I loved that it also had SPF 15. I recently needed a replacement and ordered from Amazon. What a disappointment. The formulation has indeed changed, for the much worse. It feels like Chapstick when applied, very waxy, and hardly left any tint on the lips. So I will be on the search for a new lip balm!</li>
    <li> Awful product! I&#x27;m shocked this is an Alba product, honestly! I&#x27;m normally a big fan of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency if this lip tint is like grease paint, and it stinks like petroleum-based paint (peppermint flavored-- my a$$!). My whole mouth tastes like melted plastic. To top it off, it made a HUGE mess just trying this on my lips for the first/last time. It completely fell apart, glooping a huge wad of this crap on my lips, then when I attempted damage control with my finger, it got all over the place. Product was not melted, it just &amp;#34;acted&amp;#34; as such because it, well, sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my pics of this crap! I know this stuff was cheap, but don&#x27;t throw away your money on this total loser from Alba!!</li>
    <li> Looked used when I got it. Color is good, but smell is terrible. It smells like muddy river rocks. It also has gritty texture. I have the bloom color which is a little light for me, but it has a pepermint, cooling, smooth smell and texture. Love the color, hate everything else. Maybe Amazon is trying to sell an old expired batch or something. Will try to purchase again from different supplier. Can&#x27;t believe there is such a huge difference between colors of same product.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth. Stays on. Comes in a variety of fashionable colors. All natural 15 SPF. It&#x27;s the best tinted lip gloss thats ever been on the market. Nothing compares. Other products dry my lips. This product keeps them moist all day.</li>
