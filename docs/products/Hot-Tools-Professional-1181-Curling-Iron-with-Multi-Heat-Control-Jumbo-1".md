<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We have looked at alternatives, but always come back to the same make and model.  They do the job well, but the rotating cord connection probably fails after 1 to 2 years.  Older models lasted longer.  This time I bought a spare since I knew what to expect.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron, I have very long straight hair this is the only curling iron that I can use and have my hair hold the curl.  Bought one for my daughter too.</li>
    <li> Nothing beats it.  I took the clamp off to make it into a curling wand for beachy waves.  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> This is my first curling iron. So far, I&#x27;m satisfied. Have it in 1 inch diameter. It gives me just right bouncy curls. There&#x27;s a risk of getting burned if you touch the metal plate by accident when it&#x27;s hot, so caution is necessary when using it. Plus, one must follow instruction as to the length of time of use so as not to burn your hair. When I get used to curling, maybe I&#x27;ll get another one for smaller curls, same brand.</li>
    <li> this is the best curling iron I have ever purchased.  I have fairly long hair and can curl my whole head in apx 10 mins.</li>
    <li> I have fine long straight hair. it never holds a curl. like, ever. this iron does the trick! I used it for the first time yesterday and it held a curl in humid weather and I got so many compliments! must have, for sure!</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas present for a family member and was excited to received.  Came on time and a good price.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hot tools curling irons since high school, would not use any other brand! Best curling iron ever!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron!  I just got my hair cut short and it&#x27;s the perfect tool for getting great curls everytime.  The iron warms up fast and stays hot.  The cool tip at the end is very useful for controlling the iron and the cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled up like so many others do.  As soon as I have need for a bigger curling iron, I&#x27;ll know where to go!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this iron about people with fine hair having a lot of good luck with this curling iron, so I was sad when it didn&#x27;t work for me. Even though I didn&#x27;t expect the curl to last long, even with a ton of hairspray and all the other tricks I&#x27;ve tried over the years, my hair was completely flat in less than 30 minutes. Other curling irons have at least left a little curl on the ends and the look of hair that&#x27;s been curled that day. I got neither from this iron. I would not recommend it, and am probably going to return it or try to sell it to someone else.</li>
    <li> have i ever had curls last me all day, ive tried sprays, gels with them, but this curling iron did it for me. Love it</li>
    <li> It works like magic! I keep it on the lowest setting and the curls hold even through the next day.</li>
    <li> I have long thick wavy hair and hard to curl. I purchased the 1-inch Iron and it was amazing! It does get pretty hot almost burned myself a couple times! My curls lasted all nite, Next time i will get a bigger size curler for more looser curls. Def recommend this product.</li>
    <li> 1/1/15 Great curling iron. Not one complain about it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even find the manual of this item. I search the website, no video instructions for this item. I don&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron at a great price. Doesn&#x27;t fry your hair. I curl my hair everyday with it and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
    <li> This has been approved and works well.  My wife loves it and says it&#x27;s amazing. What more can I ask?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great curling iron. It seriously gets hot fast... Which is a good thing for me! I would def recommend it to anyone looking for a nicely priced iron.</li>
    <li> works great for shorter hair... my only complaint is I wish it would slide off the hair more easily...makes great curl</li>
    <li> Love this! It works very well. I have thick hair and this is the first one i have found that does the basic wave curling and even thick curls!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Heats like a real professional iron.</li>
    <li> I love Hot Tools curling irons. They heat up really quickly and have several heat settings. It will curl even the most stubborn of hairs. I personally like to take the clamps off to make it a curling wand instead as I&#x27;m not that handy at curling my hair with the clamps. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use any other brand for curling irons in the future!</li>
    <li> I use this iron at the medium setting, otherwise, I feel it would be too hot for my hair.  I like that it heats up quickly and the handle feels very comfortable to use.  It is what I was looking for and happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Working really well so far. I would recommend this for anyone that does not want to spend a fortune on a really fancy curling iron.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron with an inexpensive price tag. It heats up quickly, has a swivel cord, and has multiple degree settings. With long, fine hair I never have used the setting over the middle temperature and it holds my curl all day (with just a spritz of hair spray to set). I also love the swivel cord...You wouldn&#x27;t believe how convenient that is. I would recommend this if you are in the market for a new curling iron but do not want to dish out the big bucks on the so called high end irons. If you have really long thick hair, I would suggest a larger barrel size though.</li>
    <li> My hair has always had trouble trying to hold a curl.  With this curling iron I can get my curls to stay for a few days, which I have only ever been able to do when getting my hair done professionally.  This is a great product that is easy to use.  I love the plastic cap on the end of the barrell so I don&#x27;t burn myself.  There are many different heat settings, but I always use the highest one.  The highest heat setting is as high as a ceramic hair straightener or curler, which can be hard to find.  After curling my hair I don&#x27;t find my hands hurting like I have with other curling irons.  This is a great design and a great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron on a whim after using my girlfriends.  I love and I am addicted to it.  I must get the bigger one like the 2 or 3inch ones.  The 1\\&quot; is just more time consuming but I got to say it makes great curls..</li>
    <li> fast delivery, works great</li>
    <li> Really love the extra long cord.  I have thin hair so I only have on setting 3 and it works great.  Nice Curling iron!!!</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t know about this curling tool until I borrowed a friend&#x27;s for Coachella. I like that the barrel spins so it doesn&#x27;t create that clamped piece of hair. I have a NUME curling wand and I&#x27;m just not good with tools that don&#x27;t have a clamp!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I already had a hot tools curling iron that was a larger barrel bought from a retail store at a much higher price.  I wanted a smaller barrel and took to Amazon to find it cheaper which I did.  I&#x27;m a big fan of hot tools products, so definitely go with this if you are looking for a good curling iron at a good price.</li>
    <li> It is WAY too big.  I dont need a iron that big so I returened it.  I also ordered the izunami flat iron 1 inch at the same time which curls hair(loose or spiral) so I retured the curling iron. They dont exaggerate the word jumbo that IT IS!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the second Hot Tools purchase I have made from Amazon.  I am beyond pleased with both.  Though the price is not that much more than you&#x27;d pay at a discount retailer, it is a far superior product.  I will be looking to buy this type of product in the future!  Shipping was a little slow...but then again, it was free!</li>
    <li> Awesome curling iron and great price!!!! Quick delivery!!!! Highly recommend this seller and this item!!!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything wrong with this iron.  It works great and heats up fast! It also makes my curls looks nice.</li>
    <li> Works great. Heats up in 30 seconds or less and I can say does the job. I have thick hair and this iron works perfectly. Great value for your $</li>
    <li> I have read about Hot Tools for years, but never bought one because I mistakenly thought they were too pricey. This one curls beautifully.</li>
    <li> I thought this curling iron would really be salon quality since most salons use this brand but it didn&#x27;t compare to my cheap Conair curling iron.  I don&#x27;t have very course hair and I had it on the highest setting and it didn&#x27;t hold a curl very long at all.  Needless to say, I had to return it for the price.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is fantastic! Easy to use, affordable and curls last all day! I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my curls since I started using it. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Works Awesome.  Exactly what I ordered.  Love it</li>
    <li> Great heat, makes a curel really fast. Just what I needed and great price.</li>
    <li> I first heard about Hot Tools from my hairstylist, who showed me how to curl my hair.  She did one curl as an example and it looked great.  She was already styling it with a flat iron and she had to go over that single curl several times to get it straight again.  That alone impressed me.  Then I, being the research and value girl I am, had to go online and find out what others said.  Some loved it and others warned me not to turn it up too high or it would burn my hair.  I also checked out what size to order and it seemed like the one inch was the most versatile.  Now that I have used it I know that for my hair, this is the perfect curling iron.  I cautiously had it on high at first, then I bumped it all the way up and had no problems.  My hair is fine but I have a ton of it and the curls lasted all day, even after I raked my fingers through my hair several times.  I was also warned about how the gold series will hold too tight and leave a mark but it was just right for me.  It provided enough hold so my hair would not slip out and I did not have any of those crimp marks.  Now I know how my professional up-dos in the past looked so great, they used this iron and I will too from now on!!</li>
    <li> I just recently returned a curling iron, that was crap and close to the same price as this one. So when I ordered this I was a little hesitant ... but I love it! Great product for a great price .. gets very hot, but doesn&#x27;t fry hair.</li>
    <li> Works OK, does not get hot enough to hold curl long term. I have very fine silky hair and this has always been an issue, but I was recently spoiled by the curling wands that would hold curls in my hair for DAYS. I hoped this would do the same, but it didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s fine for styling for the immediate event, but if I curl in the AM and go out again after work, I have to curl all over again. I</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron ever! Creates smooth curls that last! Very fast shipping. Got it the very next day with prime shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been using this style of iron for years. I have tried other styles of iron but none can measure up to this. It is the best.</li>
    <li> Super awesome flat iron. Heats up really quickly and easy to use!</li>
    <li> First curling iron I had (since high school) still works but I just wanted a new one just because. This brand is very sturdy and gets the job done. Love the curls and I would recommend this for anyone</li>
    <li> Gift to mother n law. She really likes it.</li>
    <li> Always use the iron curler!</li>
    <li> This tool is my MUST have! I have curly hair and the 1 inch barrel is perfect to smooth unruly curls and tame frizz. The tension in the barrel is perfect for ease of control and just enough pressure to effortly tame tresses without tugging. There is no need to spend $200 on a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; iron. This one does the job.</li>
    <li> Love this item. Great price. My daughter ended up with it, so I had to purchase another</li>
    <li> This curling iron seems a bit cheap but ultimately does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> perfect curls any time - give them a day and you get perfect waves, too!</li>
    <li> It does the job, but is is worth the price? Maybe I will see the value if I am still using it in ten years. My hairdresser recommended this brand. Bought to replace a ceramic iron, which left my hair straight. I have short, naturally wavy /curly hair which is 30% gray, neither thick nor thin, nor course or fine. I don&#x27;t find that style lasts any longer than with the old iron, but I do seem to have less frizz. I am not sure if this is because the weather has begun to change here in Florida from hot and humid to warm and less humid, or if the iron itself is responsible. I use it on the hottest setting without incident, and curling goes very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I hate that it does not shut off automatically, have left it on twice, and I have burn marks on the pad I use to lay it on to show for it. On/off button is small and easy to accidentally move, and indicator light is barely perceptible. If you buy, be sure to cover your vanity surface with heat-proof material. I am now attaching it to a surge protector with a brightly lit on/off switch which I can turn off after use.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron! After purchasing several, some $100+ irons, this is my ultimate favorite. Anyone who is looking for a high quality curling iron can find it in this one while still not breaking the bank!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I had one that quit heating, and I replaced it with this one, I am very pleased with my purchase, and I saved a few dollars by ordering, I am happy to have found your site, and will be ordering in the future as well, thanks again, Jean</li>
    <li> Great value and multipurpose iron.  I have long hair and originally purchased a 1 1/2&amp;#34; size; however, the curl would quickly fall, so I decided to go with a 1&amp;#34;.  Hands down best investment I made.  If I want looser curls, I finger brush through the curl when it is still warm.  For tighter curls, I pin the curl and allow to fully cool.</li>
    <li> Aesthetically, the curling iron is very nice. It&#x27;s light and the cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled. But even in the hottest setting, I feel like it&#x27;s not hot enough. Maybe it&#x27;s just that I have thick hair. If the iron was a little hotter I think it would be perfect. But I still like it, and with a little bit more time my hair comes out just as I want it.</li>
    <li> This curling iron was recommended to me by my stylist and I absolutely love it. I have very fine, straight hair and this curling iron creates perfect, beachy waves that look fantastic and last all day. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I just received the curling iron about two hours ago, and I was very excited to try it out. I debated about which curling iron to get, and I saw nothing but good reviews for the Hot Tools brand. I wanted something long-lasting, in comparison to the Conair 1-1/2 ceramic barrel curing iron I had, which lasted about 3 years. I mistaken my old curling iron for a 1 inch barrel, so that led me to buy the 1 inch Hot Tools curling iron. I was happy with my 1-1/2, because with my long, thick hair, it gave me loose waves for a more casual look. But in no way am I regretting my accidental purchase, because I&#x27;m able to create the same look from that of the 1-1/2 inch curling iron. But now, I also have the option to make tighter curls, which is a plus. While I&#x27;ve only had the product for two hours, I can tell after its first use that this is much different from the rest. Absolutely no hair was stuck to the curling iron, and the curls are smooth. I&#x27;ve used my flat iron to create a more wavy look, after my curling iron broke. But I can achieve a better look from the 1 inch curling iron, if I keep the temperature on a lower setting. Overall, great buy. Don&#x27;t hesitate on this brand.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron, makes beautiful curls that hold very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for a few months now, and I love it.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and it gets very hot, very quick.  The only thing you have to watch out for is that it&#x27;s super hot, you can burn your forehead in an instant, and that doesn&#x27;t look the greatest no matter how great your curls are!  But, you can adjust the temperature of the iron, so it&#x27;s all good.  Great product!</li>
    <li> really like this, price was great.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t usually hold curl well, but this curling iron works wonders! My curls stay in all day and night. Depending on how you use it, you can create a couple of different looks/styles with the 1\\&quot;. I highly recommend this curling iron for any hair type.      My old roommate got me hooked on this brand. Her mom had a salon and Hot Tools were what they used and I can totally see why. Great brand and products from them.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and my hairdresser claims that this price is lower than her   professional discount.  The price was so good I bought a couple of different sizes.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great curling iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister for Christmas. She loves it and says it works better than her last one. (I haven&#x27;t used it but I can vouch that the curls look great.) Great price too. : - )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It has been almost a year and the curling iron is still functional. The curls still look amazing also!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this so far. I had an issue with other curling irons not being able to style my hair. My hair is kind of fragile though not super thin. It just never wants to curl! I had heard so many good things about this iron, so I decided to get it. It was the best price that I could find for the item, and when I submitted my order, I got a message saying that they are shipping it early. It was a great start!  So, I got it and immediately tried it out. I heard that a lot of people say that the lowest setting is already extremely hot, that people should be careful, so I tried it on the lowest setting first. It&#x27;s lowest setting was(next to the)highest setting on my last curler (which didnt work) yet this iron made a curl. I was extremely pleased with it. After a while of trying it out, I found that I actually had to increase the temperature just a little bit to get curls that stay for a long time.  But I wanted to say something here. My hair is really difficult to curl. This iron makes curls, sure, but I want to tell people that you may find it hard for your curls to stay. It doesnt always mean that it&#x27;s the irons fault. It could simply mean that you arent using the right hairspray or you just need to spray the hairspray on FIRST and then AFTER just in case. I hope that helps you because that tip certainly has helped me since my hair will never create a curl unless hairspray has already been applied.  When I curled my hair with this iron, the next night my hair was still wavy. It was excellent!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Love the different temperature settings. Curling iron comes with replacement springs included so you know it will last longer. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Sorry for the other reviewer and her charred hair but we&#x27;ve found just the opposite.  I have four daughters and we LOVE the hot tools line.  We have never been disappointed.  The heating control is terrific.  Some of my girls have fine hair so we don&#x27;t need so much heat.  Another has courser hair and we need the extra high setting.  Not only that, the handle is very easy to hold on to.  It is small enough for all size of hands.  And (I know this is long--sorry), the end of the barrel where the plastic attaches never gets hot and it is big enough to hold stable so you can control the end and curl long long pieces. Very good design overall.  Don&#x27;t buy something else to save a few bucks.  This will last a long time.  It is a great product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this. Great price. You can adjust the heat for your hair type. Holds curls great just spray a little hair spray and your sure to look and feel your best!</li>
    <li> I have medium length, fine, and straight hair. I have tried many different brands of curling irons and finally found my mate with Hot Tools 1181 1 inch iron. Since my hair is so fine and straight, other brands I tried like Conair, Revlon, and many others did NOT keep my curls in place more than an hour regardless of how much hairspray I used. I have heard so many recommendations and positive things about Hot Tools so I decided to try it and I LOVE it. The iron heats up fast, easy to use, and my curls stay in place for five hours WITHOUT any hair spray. In addition, I did not even use the maximum temperature to get that result, only at low-medium heat. By far this is the best curling iron I have used so far, as good as a CHI without the expensive tag.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair with a little wave and a refusal to hold curl. After years of fighting, I gave up on curling my hair and straightened it instead. Then, one of my favorite YouTube makeup gurus did a video over how to get the perfect curl - using this curling iron. At $25 with Prime shipping, I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up FAST. I plug it in, switch it on, brush and section off my hair and it is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;- It gets hot - very hot. This is great if you have stubborn hair like mine. Yes, my curls get loose throughout the day, but there is still definite curl and body at the end of the day. I can&#x27;t really expect any curling iron to keep my hair perfect throughout the day, so I&#x27;m happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;- Multiple heating levels. Fine hair or hair that holds curls easily can use the very lowest setting, thicker and coarser hair can use the hottest. I would definitely recommend starting on the lowest and working your way up depending on your hair and how tight you want the curls. I started low and the middle setting has proven to be good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;- The on/off switch. As someone paranoid about leaving things plugged in, I like that I can switch it off (and then unplug it, just to be sure). If you wanted to leave it plugged in all time, you could easily use the switch - there&#x27;s a light, too, to show you when it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- None, really. It is cheap, great quality, and effective. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I already had the Hot Tools Professional 1181 curling iron.  I really liked it.  It burned out, so I wanted to replace it with the same one.  It is a great product.  I also received it in a very short time.  Wouldn&#x27;t use any other curling iron ever.</li>
    <li> Hot Tools are the best curling iron on the market. I always recommend them to friends and family. I now have two, my sister now has one, and I convinced my mom to get one as well. It gets really really hot so the curls last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1&amp;#34; is good for tighter curls and medium length hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a few weeks ago and had to come back and review it. I LOVE THIS IRON! After struggling to curl my hair for years without it falling out within an hour, I finally bought a new curling iron and this was PERFECT. I have thick, very long hair and this iron did the job. The temperature can be easily adjusted for my thinner strands in the front, and more heat for the thicker hair in back. It heats up quickly and the is very easy to use. I got a 1\\&quot; barrel which is perfect for tight curls, or loose waves by simply combing out your hair. It shipped quickly. Buy this product!!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is great. The cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled, it heats up quickly, and it makes beautiful curls. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Mine was left in CA, I have been lost without it!  The quality is amazing and quick heat makes for styling on the run easy!</li>
    <li> This is great to curl my long thick hair! I have never had a better curling iron! The heat selector is awesome, I can have my choice of heat! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever used (and I have used many). It heats quickly and curls well.  The variable heat setting is great, as I have very fine hair.  The cord is long. And the curler came with a replacement spring - you know, the little thing that breaks on most curling irons within a year. I only made one modification:  I had to use tape to keep the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch on.  Something about my technique caused me to inadvertently turn the device off during use.  Overall, however, this is a terrific tool.</li>
    <li> I got this in June and it is already DEAD!  It lasted 3 months.  One morning it got REALLY hot and burnt some of my hair.  I looked at the twist dial and it was set at what it had always been set at.  I turned it down by half and waited for it to cool a little bit. Next morning, it would not heat up at all.</li>
    <li> My wife like this so much we bought two.  One for our house and one for her gym bag for after working out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend purchasing:  Yes</li>
    <li> This curling iron works FAR better than any other iron I have purchased in the past.  I would highly recommend this brand and this particular product!</li>
    <li> The curling iron came fast and was in GREAT condition!!! It is a FANTASTIC curling iron that heats fast and creates very tight curls!</li>
    <li> This curler is amazing for getting any look from beachy casual to spirals.  It has an adjustable temperature, and it gets to the desired heat quickly.  For the price, you really can&#x27;t get a better curler, and it does the same job as one 5x the price.</li>
    <li> really nice, and easy to use. i don&#x27;t regret at all buying this curling iron. BUT i would like to have something tie the cable, that&#x27;s the only thing is missing to make it perfect.</li>
    <li> This was an amazing curling iron, perfect size for my hair and heated up so fast! And then all of sudden I turn it on one morning and it doesn&#x27;t heat up...Like at all. It is stone cold. This is ridiculous. I bought it only in July and it&#x27;s September now... The window to replace/return it has already closed so I have basically wasted my money on a defective curling iron.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron.  I like the idea that you can have variable degrees of heat, not just high or low.  One thing, I believe on the description, it says it has a 9\\&quot; (meaning inch) cord.  No, it is nine feet, not inches.  I didn&#x27;t need nine feet, but it should be changed on the description. Another thing I really like about it is the swivel for the cord at the end of the handle.  That is a real plus for me. A loop on the handle so you can hang it would have been nice.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wife has been using this product for years, old one broke, bought a replacement one, good price in comparison to the price at the local beauty products shop.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned!  Heats quickly, curls smoothly...helps prevent the harsh lines that appear when using drug-store quality tools.  I have longer than shoulder-length hair...this helps create curls that are formed well &amp; loosen gently throughout the day.  HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this product.I have fine, straight, obstinate  hair.. I use it on shorter hair to avoid having a perm. It heats rapidly, allows me to set the heat level I want,  is convenient to use, and the waves stay in for several days.</li>
    <li> I had no idea curling my hair could be this easy. This curling iron is BOMB. I previously owned a curling iron purchased from Target. Probably whatever seemed decent/inexpensive at the time. I have thick, stick-straight Asian hair that never wants to do anything but lay flat. When I used to curl it with my old curling iron, it would take 90 minutes and tons of styling product to get it to hold for a couple hours before being reduced to curled-under ends by the end of a long night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with the Hot Tools curling iron, it takes 30 minutes or less to create awesome spiral curls. No styling products used (though I might get some sort of heat-protecting spray). My curls still looked pretty good after sleeping on them overnight and after a light sweat during a non-cardio workout. I&#x27;m 100% sold.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.&lt;br /&gt;The one I ordered this time does not seem as hot.</li>
    <li> The Curling Iron worked for about 2 weeks perfect, then one day I went to go use it and it singed off my hair within seconds!!!</li>
    <li> I was one that always said&amp;#34;no difference in curling irons&amp;#34;  But... now I say&amp;#34; this is the best !&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve been using for a few years a Studio Wise brand from JCP.  Just by going by the other reviews, I decided to give this a try. It curls much better and faster than my old one. Also, it holds the curls longer. And also, by the time the old one had heated up, now I already have my hair curled! So fast !  Try and you&#x27;ll be amazed, like me!</li>
    <li> very good iron curler!</li>
    <li> Item received promptly and was as advertised.  Will use this seller again.  A+  My daughter was delighted as it was a gift.</li>
    <li> I like this hot tools curling iron because of its great design and functionality.  It&#x27;s long handle makes it easy to hold when I twist my wrist. The top end that attached with rubber is not hot when the tool turns on.  So that makes it more easy to control the tool.  I also like that it become hot very fast (only for a few seconds).  The heat adjustment is great. I have a fine hair at shoulder length, and this product can curl my hair very good (normally my hair is hard to curl).  I got the 1\\&quot;, and it makes nice curls on my hair.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> This is the third one I&#x27;ve purchased :)</li>
    <li> Best curling iron I have ever had!  I used to use conair curling irons, but never again!  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hot tools purchase that I have made. I would HIGHLY recommend it for anyone looking for a curling iron as an investment.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use! It is a good product!</li>
    <li> It took me a few tries to get nice curls, but this is how I achieve soft and shiny curls. Btw, my hair is shoulder length, thin and mostly straight, which usually never holds curls. I bought the 1\\&quot; Jumbo curling iron because the 3/4\\&quot; makes my curls too tight for the look I want.     First, get a lightweight hairspray (a cheap but great one is Herbal Essences). This is important! Before, I tried one by Tigi, and it made my hair crunchy looking, yet flattened my hair after less than an hour. So what I do is wash my hair normally, then put some hairspray in while it&#x27;s still wet (not too much, though), and let it air dry. Then I brush it just so it doesn&#x27;t look frizzy. At first I used the clamp, but for some reason some of my hair was stubborn and didn&#x27;t curl. So instead, I hold the iron upside down (handle is up), take a strand of my hair and just wind it around the iron for 10 seconds. I was ecstatic when this resulted in neat and soft curls that hold! And it only takes 10 minutes to curl all of my hair.    At first, I almost returned the iron. However, I&#x27;m glad I experimented a little. I have to have it at the highest temperature setting which is a little surprising - all the other reviews said that this iron is way too hot and burns off your hair, yet any lower setting won&#x27;t work on my THIN and STRAIGHT hair.     In short: this is a great iron that I&#x27;m very happy with! Thankfully, it doesn&#x27;t take forever to style - this would have been a deal breaker for me (I really can&#x27;t be bothered to spend more than 20 minutes to get ready in the morning  and would rather sleep a little longer ;-)).</li>
    <li> I have bought at least a dozen curlers from walmart, sallys, target, dollar store, etc and none of them come even close to comparing to this curler!!  I have bought curlers that literally do NOT make a wave in my hair after holding it there for 15+ seconds..but this you leave in for 5 seconds and its golden.  Heats up super fast, and stays hot, I can do my whole head in 10 minutes. Don&#x27;t know what I would do without this curler! Best $25 ive spent.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introducted this curling iron to me.  She uses it in her shop.  This is my second one (although the other one is still working).  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have just-past shoulder length, incredibly thick, STRAIGHT hair, that will not curl for anything. I&#x27;ve had chemical perms multiple times, as well as relied on sleep-in rollers to get my hair to curl, only to have those curls fall out in a few hours. My other curling iron is a Conair 2-ish inch iron, which does fairly alright, but they fall out in 10 minutes tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I love this curling iron. Granted that, curling a small piece of my hair takes turning this thing on to 430 degrees and leaving it in for about 25-35 seconds (not even kidding, I even had to re-curl some spots if I didn&#x27;t leave it in for that long)! But, the point is that this iron CURLS.. like a boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I would highly recommend Hot Tools curling irons to anyone with inhumanely thick hair as mine is! It took a solid hour, at least, to curl all of my hair, now I&#x27;ll get to see how long they stay in... ETA: Curls have stayed in through the night! Had to do some re-curls on some of them, but mostly, they&#x27;ve stayed in pretty strong! Now I&#x27;m thoroughly sold on this iron! :&#x27;D</li>
    <li> The main reason I ordered this was because of the outstanding reviews, and it lived up to it. My wife loves it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have never been good at styling my own hair.  I would post a few embarrassing high school photos to prove it, but it&#x27;s not Thursday. Now that I&#x27;m, ahem, into my 30s, I thought it would be a great time to get serious about it.  At the request of a hair dresser friend I purchased this curling iron and had a short tutorial on how to use it.  I love using this to style my hair for several reasons. First of all, it heats up fairly quickly.  The cord can rotate 360 degrees so you don&#x27;t get tangled when switching hands.  There is also a long enough cool grip tip so you don&#x27;t burn your hand when holding the end of it.  Another nice feature is the temperature control, though admittedly I just sort of guess at a setting that I think is good (hot is hot, right?)  I can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about it other than the fact that it won&#x27;t just do my hair for me.  When will they invent that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, one of the things my friend taught me was not to take the iron all the way to the end of my hair, but to start curling at the middle.  Apparently I was stuck in the 80s with how I used curling irons.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works just like the salon one.</li>
    <li> I received it in perfect shape, good package. I already used twice and it worked perfectly, just be careful to not use too high temperature, it could burn your hair. It makes very beautiful curls and let your hair very shinny. I also use a protection before using the iron, just in case. Curls still going at the end of the day. Small criticism about the pliers which is little hard to press, but maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s new.</li>
    <li> best curling iron in the world</li>
    <li> I love it easy to use and it gets hot fast.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of curling iron for years.  I like everything about this curling iron - it does the job very well.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I previously purchased a 1-1/2 hot tools ceramic curler and I wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted, and I tried so many methods of curling my really thick straight hair. I paid forty dollars for that curler so I didnt wanna go spending much more on another one. I saw that discount jungle had one for $16 so I decided to go for it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I didn&#x27;t wanna get my hopes up but I am so glad I got it. I actually works on my difficult hair. I was afraid I would only be able to straighten my hair but now I get to have more styling options.</li>
    <li> most amazing curling iron evver made!!!! i have super super thickkk hair. and it curls it soo great. each curl takes up to 10-15 seconds. u only have to curl each piece of hair once. which is great because what girl doesnt want to have healthy hair and protect it from heat dammage as muchas possible. i will never go back to a non-hot tools product.</li>
    <li> I love this brand! I&#x27;ve been buying if for years. I like that it gets hot in seconds. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Fake hoot tools- had item for exactly 1 year. blacktop melted, hair would get caught and pulled, clip broke off and now it doesn&#x27;t heat up. Have an authentic hot tool curling iron bought in 2012 with none of the above issues.  buyer beware</li>
    <li> Worked fine for awhile  and then started to come apart and one day the second I put my bangs in it, it burnt them off immediately and then it began smoking. I threw it in the snow before it just started a fire</li>
    <li> woooooow i like it , it was amaaazing hot tool , i really love this , thanks a loooot</li>
    <li> Its awesome and I don&#x27;t need to use a straightener before hand. My only issue is sometimes its too hot.</li>
    <li> With long and thick hair it is hard to find a tool that actually provides the right waves and curls. Most curling irons don&#x27;t heat up enough or only last a few uses before they have a short and no longer work. I have owned three different Hot Tools curling irons and they have lasted me quite a lot uses. I use this curling on my hair daily and achieve the right curls without having to use any product in my hair. It is great that it has a heat setting so that you can control the heat output. Most curling irons only have one setting although it claims to be multiple. Recommend this for anyone looking for the right curl.</li>
    <li> Great product great price!</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron in June 2010.  I use it once a day most days.  I loved using it until last month, it stopped working.  There may be a short, because if I fuss with it, I can get it to turn on sometimes.  Looks like I&#x27;m throwing it in the trash.  I&#x27;m frustrated, my cheaper low end irons have lasted 5+ years...this Hot Tools iron lasting only 20 months...lame.</li>
    <li> Wife is absolutely in love with this. The best one she has ever owned according to her.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron this is my second one and I am in the process of buying one for my mom.  These are the best curling irons ever made.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, price was best I&#x27;ve seen so far, and box in good condition. This is a gift but very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have vey thick, wavy, shoulder length hair. This iron works very well. I turn it up to almost 8. It gets vey hot and does nice curls that last.</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron it gets really hot . It curls the hair nice .</li>
    <li> Bought this curling iron at the recommendation from my hairdresser due to my thick hair.  It is awesome.  Gets very hot and makes creating curls and waves a breeze.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> This curling iron heats up very well, up to 430 F on the dial. I usually cannot get my medium/fine hair to hold a curl for very long, but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with hot tools. The 1 inch barrel gets my hair into a nice spiral so I can shake it out into beachy waves. Fabulous price too. Similar models at beauty stores were twice the price!</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of curling irons and this is the best by far; it heats up to 400 degrees, which is a must for harder to manage/curl hair.  It is a little more expensive than others but it is worth the $$$ and you can definitely tell the difference.  My favorite feature is the temperature dial - it can&#x27;t get accidently turned down or turned off while in use, unlike other brands!</li>
    <li> Love love love!! Very impressed!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast service.  As promised.</li>
    <li> This reasonably priced curling iron works like a charm. It really is professional grade. I love how hot it gets, yet seems to not be damaging. Would buy again (but probably will not need to for a long time because of quality).</li>
    <li> This is the 5th Hot Tools curling iron I&#x27;ve bought. Not because they were defective or stopped working for any reason, but because I keep them in two residences, gave one to my daughter, and accidentally left two in hotels. One I&#x27;ve had for nearly 10 years, and it still works like new. They heat quickly-as advertised-in one minute. The only reason I gave a 4* rating is because they also get extremely hot. Do not EVER use the highest temperature setting because they will absolutely fry your hair. The first time I used one, it literally burned a couple of spots to a crisp. That being said, once I had the good sense to turn the heat down, they worked perfectly. They&#x27;ve never malfunctioned, and the hair is gripped tightly and doesn&#x27;t slip out. This is a great product and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and gets very hot, which  makes the curl stay better. I am very satisfied with this product! :)</li>
    <li> Hot tools are fabulous. Great price for a great product</li>
    <li> Hot Tools Professional is the only curling iron I like to use and this one is no different.  Great price and great purchase.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair. This sucker heats up fast and gets the job done fast. It comes with extra springs. I hope that I never have to replace them but glad they&#x27;re there if I do.</li>
    <li> Item doesn&#x27;t work and it says it is not eligible to be returned.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!  UPDATE:  Amazon will be refunding my money.  I am not sure if I will order another one or not.</li>
    <li> I have brought this when it was like 5 dollars cheaper! I tried it out for the first time today, and I love it! I have typical asian hard to curl hair, and this does the job. I run some Crack hair treatment in beforehand, and my hair looks great. It holds, and looks so shiny and voluminous. Love it!</li>
    <li> Thanks! I satisfied my purchase. I liked  this product.I would recommend this  Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control, Jumbo 1&amp;#34;to my friends. Good seller!</li>
    <li> I have been through 2 of these curling irons in 10 years, I absolutely love this device for my hair, curls in 15 minutes and I love the multiple heat settings. A must for my hair.</li>
    <li> Gets as hot as I wanted and curls great ! Easy to use. The only problem I have found with any of these irons that have a cord that is movable.....they get a crack in them and then short out. That process takes about a year to happen</li>
    <li> Great size for longish and thin hair; holds the curl really well. However hair spray always leaves residue, so I suggest cleaning it regularly</li>
    <li> Love this!  Heats really quickly and works well!</li>
    <li> This was bought as a replacement to the same item I&#x27;ve had for 12 years. It creates the perfect curls/waves. I always get asked how I get my curls to behave. This is the secret tool.</li>
    <li> This iron heats fast, stays hot, and makes curls that will last all day or night.  The temperature control is handy, as you can adjust the heat depending on your hair type and the style you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Wow, this iron is amazing.  My stylist used it on my hair recently and I bought one for myself.  It heats up real hot, real fast, and creates beautiful big curls.  My curls still look awesome the second day!  I start curling from the top and work my way down to the ends of the section of hair for a softer less springy curl, and I alternate curling towards the front, to the back and so on - every other curl.  Great price too on amazon!</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with any Hot Tools brand of curling irons.  They heat up fast (beware- I&#x27;ve burned myself a few times!)  and keep the curl in my hair, all store bought ones could not do this!  My hair stylist uses these brands.  I have one and bought 3 more for my sister and nieces and they agree it&#x27;s by far the best they have ever used.  Just don&#x27;t wind up the cord around the handle Bc it causes wear and tear over time and may break the wiring at the base of the handle.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I got this curling iron! It heats up in about a minute and it gives you perfect curls. The cord is long and it does not tangle much.</li>
    <li> This curling iron has features I would have liked very much - the temperature control, a nice sized non-heated tip, the stand and auto-off feature.  However mine didn&#x27;t work out of the box.  I would re-order, but don&#x27;t want to have to deal with the return if the next doesn&#x27;t work either.  So, three stars because it didn&#x27;t work.  The product looked quite promising.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews about this product and also heard good stuff about it. The main thing I didn&#x27;t like about it that it grabbed onto my hair and wouldn&#x27;t slide through. It felt like it was going to fry my hair that way. Also that piece of metal it rests on is a bit too out there; it interfered with the styling process.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!! Love it! Fast delivery, no hassle.  I had one of these before, was afraid I couldn&#x27;t find another one like it, exact match!!</li>
    <li> I just ordered the smallest one  and this is SUPER quality!  But, this time, as I flattened out the packaging  I noticed it has an extra spring  included in a hidden compartment!!  WISH I&#x27;d ntoticed for this 1181  just in case!  But this one replaced another brand  that  broke  at the spring on the handle.  hopefully  the seond  spring  will / would work  if needed  in both sizes?</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments. Arrived on time and I&#x27;m planning to get a one and a quarter inch next.</li>
    <li> This is awesome. Heats quickly, excellent rotation, extra long cord.</li>
    <li> Seeing as this is my first curling iron, I really don&#x27;t know what to say about it. All I know is my curls aren&#x27;t turning out very good, but I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s my own fault seeing as I&#x27;m new at this. I just have a feeling there are better ones out there, but this was cheap, so... whateva.</li>
    <li> Everyone knows Hot Tools makes the best curling irons!  Big barrel, nice shiny gold and multiple settings!  This thing rocks!</li>
    <li> Excellent Curling iron. Curls very well. This iron can get very very hot. Would definitly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Gets very hot, works great.  Good buy would recommend!</li>
    <li> Works well and heats up quickly! Curls even my stubborn hair. Can almost be too hot. Be careful if you leave it on the unprotected countertop.</li>
    <li> I have gone through so many curling irons that were of poor quality and low heat.  I was nervous buying this specific one; however, it had great reviews so I thought I would take a chance. I absolutely love it.  It really warms up quickly and it has high heat ranges.  Having thick wavy/frizzy hair, it curled my hair so nicely.  I also liked that the cord never became twisted when curling, which was a problem with previous curling irons. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have used several curling irons from the drugstore that are around this price point and wow this is the curling iron you want to buy! The quality is there, the heat is there, and the ease of use makes it worth it. Plus the curling iron feels like high quality when it seems like a lot of drugstore cheaper curling wands or irons do not have the feel of a great product!</li>
    <li> It works as expected!!</li>
    <li> Love this... I would buy this product over Enzo Milano and cortex 4 in one.. the curls loosen and hair looks naturally curled.</li>
    <li> I used my new curling iron for the first time today. It worked great! It got very hot very quickly and the curls have stayed in all day. I absolutely love it. I also love the price. It was $45.00 in a salon and I got it on Amazon for $25 and no shipping charges because I&#x27;m a Prime Member. I ordered it Monday and received it the very next day. That is a super great deal and super fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> I had this same curling iron for many years and the handle finally broke in half. I did a lot of research before decided this was still my best choice for a replacement. As a few others mentioned my old handle got sticky and I am not sure why. One factor might have been hair spray that collected on the handle over many years. SO this time I am trying to avoid using the hair spray near the curling iron.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron!!</li>
    <li> I have had a Hot Tools curling iron for year and love it.  I bought this one because it is smaller and still love.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE HEAT SETTINGS! It is a VERY strong curling iron that is built very well. It includes 2 extra spring replacements and a very soft grip handle. The gold covers heat very evenly and is a great buy!</li>
    <li> Why would you spend your money on anything else? Hot Tools is the best and will always remain the best. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this, my hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with my purchase overall.  It&#x27;s a great curling iron and is just as described by the seller.  I&#x27;m terrible at doing my own hair and especially when it comes to using a curling iron so I had to get used to using a different one but it works very well.  It also received in the described time frame and was packed well.</li>
    <li> This iron is great for a lovely price. The heat is distributed evenly and it heats up fast. I love how there&#x27;s different heat settings and It makes curls super fast. I only need to hold it in my hair five seconds.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron! Have this i but with the orange Handel  that  I bought at a cosmetic store and I love it! Gives me the bouncy curls I love and the gold barrel doesn&#x27;t fry my hair  :)</li>
    <li> As promised!! This is the exact curling iron my stylist uses at half the price. I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good quality curling iron. It gets very hot quickly and hairspray doesn&#x27;t stick to barrel. The only thing I wish was that it automaticly turned off.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron because It heats up fast and helps me create the most perfect curls. It is a must buy.</li>
    <li> I have been having some issues with this iron.  First of all it is really easy to accidentally turn it off.  This seems like no big deal but a warm iron will curl, but you will notice a few minutes later the curl didn&#x27;t set.  So you can go a long way on a warm iron before you realize you have to start over.  Be sure and check after each curl that the iron is still on.  Also it may be related to the on off switch issue, but I think not... the curl is not even.  I have long hair and I wrap the hair rather than using the clamp.  The curl is great and the top and bottom but the middle of the hair has a flat part.  This does not happen every time however.  This is a sign that the curling iron does not distribute heat evenly.  One other issue with this iron, the clamp is TIGHT.  I hope it loosens with time, but for know it feels damaging.  It so tight that there is not a good glide.  I am not sure I would recommend.  I will use a handful more times and come back with a better review if I see any improvements.</li>
    <li> I loved this curling iron while it worked. However, it didn&#x27;t last as long as expected. When I plugged it in today - nothing. It warmed up a little but I could still hold it in my hand. I only had it 2 years and used it sparingly (I had short hair most of that time). I do want to try it again... it does the job just as well as the expensive one I tried.</li>
    <li> This brand is the one my hair stylist uses &amp; that&#x27;s why I bought it. Love the heat adjustment &amp; the swivel cord,</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curling iron! Be careful because it gets really HOT. The curls stay and last long. The best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> After much debate and research we added this to our collection and have never regretted it! By far the best Iron I&#x27;ve every owned.</li>
    <li> Would give this curling iron only a fair rating. Holds hair unevenly, especially when first being used. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It gets hot fast, so no need to stand around for 10 or so minutes&lt;br /&gt;- Many temperature choices&lt;br /&gt;- The barrel is sleek and your curl will come out as such&lt;br /&gt;- The long handle and cord make styling comfortable&lt;br /&gt;- The rotable cord makes life so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;- It simply LOOKS nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for about 6 months so far and no problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Works perfect and recommend it!!</li>
    <li> The curling iron is really good. I recommend using gold ones cause it gets the job done. Gets heated quickly so you can start sooner.</li>
    <li> I had this curling iron years ago and kept saying I need to get back another one, I finally found it on amazon and decided to buy it again. The problem with the last one I had is that I would to wrap the cord up and the cord broke and I did not know where or who to send it to fix so I just discarded it. This curling iron is really good especially with the heat settings and it heats up very quickly, I am so glad I finally purchased another one after so many years. I would recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron in February, less than three months ago and suddenly it will not heat up at all. I am so disappointed. I bought this curling iron to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and I typically used it for just 10 minutes a day to fix her hair before school. Nothing out of the ordinary has happened to it, I just went to use it several days ago and found that it would not heat up. The light comes on but it does not get hot. I have used this brand in the past and loved it so I expected the same quality that I grew to love before. My previous curling iron in this brand lasted for years. So very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My favorite curling iron yet.  Works great whether you are wanting to go curly, or straight.  Easy to use, adjust the knob to the amount of heat that you want, depending on the thickness of your hair, and never have to adjust it again.  No on/off button, just plug it in and wait briefly (it doesn&#x27;t take long).  I would order this again.</li>
    <li> I had a ceramic iron that peeled on me so I decided to try titanium. It heats up in seconds I don&#x27;t even need the highest setting, my hair is long and this is a little longer than other irons so I don&#x27;t have to do my hair half at a time, which cuts the time I spend on my hair in half. The swivel cord is such a great thing.  I just got it but am loving it so far.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints here.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - curl your hair.  I use a medium temp setting and am successful with it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  It&#x27;s kind of unbelievable the quality you get for the price paid.  Great buy, would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the only curling Iron I&#x27;ve ever used.. the very first one I bought was 8 years ago and lasted me about 4 years.. before the inside hinge broke off.. I bought another and I suppose they had by then been updated with the 360* rotating cord so no it doesn&#x27;t twist and tangle.. ever since they have easily broken within months..twice the little black thumb grip broke off.. then the rotating cord stopped working (like it somehow disconnects the actual cord from the rest of the wand so there&#x27;s no power.. this was the last one I bought (bringing me to a total of 4 AFTER my first one) and from day #2 of using it the rotating cord once again was causing the power to go out.. it turns on for the most part.. but as soon as the bottom turns with the movement the light goes out.. and if I&#x27;m not watching it consistently to make sure the light is still on.. I end up losing the heat and having to wait.. I have more hair than Mofasa, curlier than a cabbage patch kid and with the very first one I got (without the rotating cord) it would take me about 10 minutes to do my hair, it was amazing.. ever since they changed the model, besides breaking as easily as I just stated, they don&#x27;t heat the same either.. it takes me longer to get to the highest setting and it takes about 3-5 slides through my hair to set the curl properly instead of just 1 (with the old model).. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the actual metal piece, but they must have for a cheaper version because like I said, it used to heat in about 40 seconds and flatten my hair with one slide.. not I&#x27;m lucky if I&#x27;m done with my hair in under 30 minutes..</li>
    <li> 1&amp;#34; is a little bigger than I wanted, but I have used these Hot Tools irons a lot in the past and they are nice.  I still have a very old Revlon 3/4&amp;#34; that is my go-to, but I needed a backup in case it decided to go out on me.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  My curls stay all day!  I was recommended to get this brand from one of my friends who is a cosmetologist.</li>
    <li> This did not have the correct voltage for use in Australia.  It is useless to me.  It would cost me more to send this back.</li>
    <li> I primarily use this whole traveling and it is light but still a good size. It also heats quickly and stays balanced with a twirling cord so no twists can get in the cord while you&#x27;re styling.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this gold plated curling iron because, after 20 years, my old one finally gave out. This one works well as far as the look of the curls it makes, however, it will need some breaking in. The spring is pretty tight and it pulls my hair as I slide the iron down. Once I have curled my hair, it is difficult to get the iron to turn loose of my hair. I would say this product will be great once it has been broken in.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an iron that would hold my curls for longer than 1/2 hour like my last iron. This iron gets hot enough and hold curls really well, my curls will stay in till well into the next day even. Highly recommend this product....</li>
    <li> Just as it described! It curls!!!! Hot tools been a good brand for curling iron, and my curls stays curled!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and a lot of it. It typically doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very long. I tried this curling iron while setting it at 380 degrees and my hair curled very nicely and held the curl. I tried it at a lower setting for normal hair at 330 degrees and the curl fell out within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This iron heats up very fast and does get very hot. I was happy with higher temperature results. Great smooth, shiny curl.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product because it is very easy to use and produces nice results.</li>
    <li> I love this curler, especially that the spring grip keeps hair from slipping out.  Some reviewers complain that it burns hair but that is because they set the temperature too high.</li>
    <li> Not good! Did not glide smoothe over the hair and pulled on it. Would not recommend!!</li>
    <li> I READ LOTS A REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS ONE. I HAVE VERY FINE HAIR AND IT WORKS GREAT. MY DAUGHTER HAS VERY THICK HAIR AND IT WORKS WELL FOR TOO. IF YOU DO NOT WATCH THE TEMP SETTING IT WILL GET REALLY HOT. THE EXTRA LONG CORD IS HELPFUL AND IT HAS A VERY GOOD SPRING ACTION.</li>
    <li> I love it sooo much, awesome product! Easy heat and very handy! and the delivery was earlier than expected, I only waited for 4 days instead of 2 weeks, amazing seller! Hope you ship 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; also here in Singapore because I will definitely buy one too! Big thanks ❤️</li>
    <li> It Is Heavy Duty And Gets Very Hot. Perfect For My Thick Hair And Makes Curls That last All Day</li>
    <li> This is the second curling iron I bought from hot tools. the first lasted almost a year, and then one day decided to fry my hair and then die. I ordered another one because the price is right, and it was a good curling iron last go around. But, this time it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the last one,and I have it turned all the way up to 400&#x27;. I have thick semi wavy hair, and it is normally easy to curl, but I have been having troubles lately curling. It&#x27;s a good iron, and I would buy one again.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron. I am a hairstylist and the one inch cuing iron I use all the time.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best curling iron I have ever used. I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and I love it. It styles my hair on the lowest heat setting and the curl holds all day. Great purchase, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My daughters have semi-fine hair, very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is perfect for the way curls I love!  It heats up super fast and had great heat settings to adjust to any hair type!  I&#x27;ve never gotten greater curls from any other brand of curling iron!  I also love the rounded cord.  It seems to not get twisted like some other irons I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I love this tool, the hair looks flawless and shiny. The only problem is that in think this isnt made of ceramic</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling iron! It has an adjustable temperature dial (but I use it on the hottest setting). The curls last long and I love the ease. You just clamp the hair and twist the bottom part, and your hair wraps around it, rather than having to manually twist your hair around it.</li>
    <li> Ive had this curling iron for a few weeks now and it is amazing! i have thick natural hair and i flat iron it and then curl it. Before i found it hard to curl and for the curl to stay. I have no such issues with this curling iron. I will definately be sticking with this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron. Gets super hot, but you can use dial to control heat setting. Heats up in seconds. They include a replacement spring, in case it is needed.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well.  Well crafted, sturdy design. Well worth the money. I would recommend it to everyone who likes quick and lasting curls.</li>
    <li> After using an old curling iron for so long, it&#x27;s amazing to have a new one like this. It creates amazing curls and is super sleek and easy to use. Might even have to purchase the 1 1/4 version too! Such a great price!</li>
    <li> Love how fast this curling iron heats up! Maybe less than a minute, it&#x27;s great. I haven&#x27;t used the heat control setting, I generally keep it as hot as it gets all of the time. Use it nearly every day and I have zero complains, strong spring, good grip, nice heat distribution and fast heat up time. All I can ask for! The cord is somewhat cumbersome, it would be nice if it were retractable but that&#x27;s definitely not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> Love love love this curling iron. Even at its lowest temp, it curled my hair better than my old curling iron at its highest. Extremely happy I took a friend&#x27;s recommendation on this item.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended this exact curling iron.  My hair never held a curl ... and if it did, forget about it lasting.  This curling iron not only curls quickly, but also lasts.  My normal pony tail has been replaced (sometimes :-)) now with a longer hairstyle.  I wrap pieces of my hair around the wand, away from my face.  It makes soft curls going away from my face.  About 10 seconds each time for each curl.  I have gotten so many compliments and have sold about 5 of these now by directing friends (and even a couple waitresses at a restaurant who wanted to know how I curled my hair) to Amazon!  I even keep a picture of this curling iron on my phone now so I can easily send the link!  Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling iron.  My curls last way longer than they did with my previous iron.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best curling irons I have owned. Even and quick heat. My only caution would be that it doesn&#x27;t pull through my hair as smoothly and easily as my ceramic curling iron but my curls do hold much better with this iron.</li>
    <li> and this one is great!  You can adjust the temperature for the length or thickness of your hair.  I&#x27;m trying to let my hair grow out a little bit, and this works exceptionally well for putting enough of a curl in my hair to keep it out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron it is well worth the money. This is the only curling iron i found that will work for my long hair and the curls stayed all day long. Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I may have just gotten a defective unit, but the wand does not heat up. I tried it in 4 different outlets without luck so will be returning it.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, and this popped up under my &amp;#34;previous purchases&amp;#34; list and I felt I had to.  This curling iron has changed my life. I know that sounds cheesy, but this iron heats up VERY fast, curls VERY quickly, and it actually holds the curl- for days (no joke). Everywhere I go people are asking me what I have done to my hair and telling me how good it looks. Considering all of this, you would think I spent $100 on it.  LOVE THIS!!!</li>
    <li> For the price its awesome !!&lt;br /&gt;I am not big on dolling myself up but when i do this curling iron worked wonderfully</li>
    <li> Great for softer curls or to help straighten tighter curls. I use my smaller one the most as my hair is medium length. A good iron for thicker hair. Use it for light curls or to add some body to the hair. A big plus is that it comes with 2 extra springs.</li>
    <li> I love these curling irons.  They are very, very hot and work well.  Have to be very careful if you have small children running around because it does leave a nasty burn if you touch it.</li>
    <li> This is so worth the money. I got the 1 inch barrel for my shoulder length hair. Perfect. Gets hot fast. Curled my hair one afternoon and 2 days later still had those bouncy curls in place. I did accidentally burn myself with the little stand, but that was my bad. Should have folded it away.</li>
    <li> The barrel is smooth, the clamp holds my hair, the curling iron heats fast and holds its heat, the temperature gauge gives a great range for different hair types, the cord swivel is very smooth in movement, the metal fold-out table top rest works well and overall my hair looks and feels great with this new curling iron...BUT, the on/off switch is very loose, so it will slide into the off position while I&#x27;m fixing my hair and without knowing, so it causes huge delays before I realize the curling iron is off and I need to turn it back on and wait until it gets to temperature. It happens everyday, so it&#x27;s a great curling iron in every way, except for the switch.</li>
    <li> This is a great hot curling iron, but it will only hold a lot of hair.  When I try to curl thin hair, it slips out!! Even if it&#x27;s LONG THIN hair, it will slip out.  It is so irritating!! So I keep having to get a bunch of hair so that it will curl it. This would be perfect if it held on to thin hair.</li>
    <li> This is the curling iron they use at my salon and I had to get one of my own. Great curls, highly recommend this tool.  I have long, thick hair and if I use hair product my curls will last all day.</li>
    <li> Not a single negative thing to say. By far the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owed! Heats up quickly and consistently every time!</li>
    <li> I have curly thick hair and I have to blow dry my hair straight and then use this tool to give me some wave - this works great for me.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron, however, it is about my fifth one as the spring on the clamp tends to loosen with use.  When the clamp is not tight smaller amounts of hair are not held effectively and they just fall off of the barrel.  Hot Tools supplies an extra spring to install when this happens, but then the replacement spring loosens.  Consequently, I just purchase another as I&#x27;ve never found another brand of curling iron that works as well for me (when the clamp is tight).</li>
    <li> I had been used to a lighter weight curling iron and ended up burning my neck several times.  I think I&#x27;ve finally &amp;#34;gotten it&amp;#34; and know how to hold the curling iron where I don&#x27;t lower it.  Just be cautious when you are first using this iron since it is a professional style and much heavier than the local Walgreen&#x27;s brand.</li>
    <li> This is such a huge improvement over my old curling iron!  It heats up very quickly, and has a nice long cord.  Additionally, the spring and the clamp provide a good amount of &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on my hair, so even if I want to curl a small amount, it doesn&#x27;t slip out of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that there are quite a number of different sizes offered.  I may even pick up one of the larger diameter ones at some point to get more of a &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34; than a curl.</li>
    <li> This is my third curling iron exactly like this! I purchased one for me to have at home; my daughter took it. I purchased another one for me at home and now a third for travel!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally very very straight (people sometimes ask if I use a straightener but I don&#x27;t), and doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well.  But the first time I used this curling iron, the curls stayed in my hair for 2 whole days, even with a shower in between!  I like that you can adjust the temperature, and it does get extremely hot in a short amount of time.  So hot in fact that if you accidentally touch the barrel, it hurts A LOT! Despite that, it didn&#x27;t fry my hair but left it very silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls looked so good that I&#x27;m considering buying this in other sizes.  I would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> This curling iron heats up quickly and is great because of the various heat settings.  The cord does tend to tangle but not nearly as often as my old one.  It is also much longer.  Very durable and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This curling iron works in my hair, which says a lot in itself, since my hair does not hold curls well.  My hair is fine and shoulder legnth and the barrel is a little big for me, no fault to the curling iron.  If your hair is this legnth, try a smaller size, maybe 3/4\\&quot; or 1/2\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Love my hot tools curling iron. Had a cheaper brand before this and it broke, and of course didn&#x27;t get as hot to hold a curl in my hair. The hot tools curler works great, maintains the hot heat I need and this is the best size for those loose waves that I love.</li>
    <li> OMG FINALLY I FOUND THE PERFECT CURLER!! I have tried almost every curler there is to Conair and Revlon, I hate them because it never seemed hot enough! My hair has tons of layers in it and no other curler would make my hair look nice. When I tried this it took me 10-15 just to make wave/add curls. Originally it took me like hours before! IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT CURLER GO FOR THIS! PROMISE YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING IT!!!</li>
    <li> Workes really well and the curls hold.  I have very fine/thin hair and I set it just under 330.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly. Good basic curling iron.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife because her old iron didn&#x27;t get hot enough quickly enough to curl her hair effectively. It took quite a long time. New one works great and she seems to like it.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron....this is my second one in different size. Love the adjustable heating. Just wish it had automatic shut off. Cause I&#x27;m bad about leaving it in</li>
    <li> I love ANY hot tools product. I have long, naturally extremely thick wavy hair and this product works wonders. I do use the HIGHEST setting due to my hair, although I know not everyone should so use caution and make sure the heat is appropriate for your hair type! I can wash and dry my hair without using a straightener afterwards and just use the curling iron will make my hair smooth and luscious curls that will last for days as I do not wash my hair every day. What I like about the curler is I don&#x27;t experience any fried smelling hair, nor do I feel it damages my hair. I have tried ionic, and more expensive products guaranteeing better, longer lasting curls and out of three other brands, nothing works better for me than HotTools. The best part about it, the curlers on amazon compared to stores (i.e. Ulta) are extremely inexpensive! I usually have to replace them every two or three years but I have to admit I do not take extremely good care of these tools. For the price, I don&#x27;t mind replacing them every few years.</li>
    <li> I have had the same model for 7 years and just about killed it when I bought this one. I figured I would stay with Hot tools, since my experience was so amazing. I am a hairstylist and use this iron 4-5 times a day. It squeeks, I tried oil and nothing helps. It sometimes heats up, Other times does not. Also I think the clamp isn&#x27;t as tight. The hair falls out of the iron unless you use it like a curling rod. I think I will return this item.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS,AND WHEN I GOT IT I DIDN&#x27;T REALIZE IT WAS A JUMBO CURLING IRON.I TRIED TO USE IT,BUT MY HAIR ISN&#x27;T LONG ENOUGH I GUESS. MY HAIR IS BELOW MY SHOULDERS AND IT REALLY DIN&#x27;T CURL MY HAIR. IT SEEMED TO GET HOT.&lt;br /&gt;I HAD TO CUT THE BOX TO GET IT OUT.SO,NOW I GUESS I&#x27;M STUCK WITH IT.SHOULD HAVE ORDERD THE 3/4 ONE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found another curling iron as good as this one.</li>
    <li> It works really well with my hair. I had a 1 1/2 inch which did not give me enough curl the 1&amp;#34; is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> It has been working great so far...Ladies in my family love it and their word is final ;-)</li>
    <li> Very pleased with delivery time. Excellent product</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron.  It is the best one I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love the heat settings and swivel cord which is nice an long.  Works great.</li>
    <li> My hair is waist length, gray and wavy...this curling iron tames it.  The 1&amp;#34; barrel reaches temp quickly and gets hot enough to control curls or iron it flat.  This is the second Hot Tools Curling Iron I have purchased.  The first one lasted 9 years; with daily use, that is remarkable in terms of quality.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist, and Hot Tools is pretty much all I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m happy with their product, and I love their curling irons. They last forever; I think my previous curling iron lasted me around 5 years, and I used it almost every day. It&#x27;s a great purchase for your money.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. So far I have not heard any complaints.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have too much experience with curling irons, but I can&#x27;t imagine one better than this.  It gets really hot!  My hair is on the fine side, and when I put it on setting 5 (out of 10) I get perfect curls after just a few seconds. I&#x27;m a little afraid to try a setting any higher, but that might be better for someone with thicker hair.  But with the 5 they come out nice and shiny!  I spray a little leave in conditioner after curling it and then loosen the curls up with my fingers and I get a really pretty waves.  You might want to get a slightly larger size for looser waves.  After doing it a few times, it only takes half an hour to do my whole head.  I also like how the cord is long enough and it doesn&#x27;t get tangled because it swivels.    Also, You cannot beat the price.  I saw this same product at target and it was on sale for $40.  I would really recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought two of this item, I loved it! it&#x27;s way better than conair and revlon which I already have. It&#x27;s perfect just make sure you use it in the US cause it will be damaged if you use it somewhere else due to electricity differences.</li>
    <li> Just wow.  I am not a beauty queen but I must say this is a huge improvement over my old curling iron.  I have it set about half way up on heat and do not leave it in more than five seconds and each section comes out beautifully curled (i do select very small sections of hair as i have so much of it).  I have never burnt my finger tips holding the end as some reviewers have complained - plenty of plastic to grab on to and it has a hallow center that you can stick a finger in to guide the hair around the iron (I could not see that from the picture).  I have a LOT of medium coarse hair and I actually find it FUN to use this tool - even more than my heated rollers!!!  I don&#x27;t know how one could burn their hair with this if they simply touched a finger to the rolled up hair, felt it was warm and released it.</li>
    <li> Does not work as advertise watch out. Not what you expect. But I guess one gets what they pay for.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool. I have crappy, thin, pin straight hair and this works amazingly well. Holds a curl so much better when I use this. Anyone who gives this a negative review only did because THEY made the mistake of not turning the temp down.</li>
    <li> Love my curling iron!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 12 year old for Christmas. She loves it! She&#x27;s been raving about the quality of it since she began using it. She loves how quickly it heats up, and that it has a heat setting that can go up to 430 degrees Fahrenheit. She loves the outcome of the curls the curling iron produces. Overall, it&#x27;s a wonderful item and I&#x27;m glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> Excellent curling iron. It does its job. It gets heated in no time and provide perfect curls for a great night.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this company!  I love hot tools curling irons. I received one from this company and it worked for a few days when for some reason it would no longer heat up. I emailed the company and received a new one by the next day at no charge.  The curling iron works perfectly and typically last for years.  I would highly recommend this company as they have superb customer service.</li>
    <li> Excellent, just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> My hair is typically difficult to curl but it curls perfectly with this Hot Tools product. Best curling iron i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best curling iron I have ever owned! It heats up VERY quickly, learned that one the hard way a few more times then I care to admit. The cord is extra long which makes moving while curling a breeze. It has a bunch of different heat settings which is great. All in all, I love this curling iron and will buy more sizes as I need.</li>
    <li> I just received my Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron today (August 7, 2014) and I am very happy with it. Heats up quickly and is easy to handle. Gets the job done. I may decided to order a smaller barrel one later.</li>
    <li> Curling Iron is exactly the same as the ones I have purchased at beauty salons for half the price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Bought this a few short months ago and today it decided that it was done working. Plugged in, full temp, NO HEAT. Waste of money. My cheapo ConAir lasted years.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron delivered quickly</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron!  It gets much hotter than the old kinds I&#x27;ve used so my hair actually stays curled!</li>
    <li> START ON LOWEST SETTING!! This is a GREAT curling iron but you MUST start on the lowest setting when you first get it. It gets incredibly hot and I thought I would be okay starting at Medium/High since I have a Chi and I have never had problems with how hot it gets... no way. I burned a huge chunk of my hair off. This has never happened before and when I talked to my stylist about it she said that this brand is a long-lasting one so it starts off with very high temperatures. WONDERFUL product but I&#x27;ll say it again, START ON THE LOWEST SETTING!!!</li>
    <li> Really like using it. It heats up fast, has a good maount of heating settings and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> i love this curling iron because it takes me only 30 min to have gorgeous curls. I have long hair, they are not that thick so it takes me less time to curl them and make them look voluminous</li>
    <li> I love heading to Amazon to search reviews for good products, and this one was no exception. Everything everyone said it true of this great product -- thanks, community!</li>
    <li> This iron heats up so quickly! It curls my hair in lovely curls, and stays all day. I have found that for best results, curl it on the second day of washing your hair. The curls will stay longer!&lt;br /&gt;I love this curling iron and will be getting more in different sizes. I am recommending this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Works great, just as expected!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite curling irons.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay iron.  It stopped heating after 1 year so now it&#x27;s in the trash!  Will look for something better.  For now i&#x27;m using a very old CHI that still works!</li>
    <li> I love this product but I have to give it just 3 stars because of a defect that hot tools seems to have with the powercord. It turns off on it&#x27;s own if the rotating cord doesn&#x27;t stay in one position, which is impossible well because it&#x27;s a rotating connection. And it&#x27;s not just mine, my sister also has one and she is the one that actually told me it would happen. Other than that it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
    <li> Bigger than the one I had before so it took some getting used to but love the temperature settings. It takes a minute to heat up so be patient with it.</li>
    <li> I like hot tools it lasts, a lot of the other curling irons i have purchased after a few months of use&lt;br /&gt;there is always a problem</li>
    <li> Bought this for my birthday. Love it! Looks great, haven&#x27;t tried it yet. Will see a few tutorials before I begin using it. Really excited!!</li>
    <li> HANDS DOWN THE BEST CURLING IRON EVER! I had to replace my last Hot Tools curling iron that I had for 10 years and was worried/sad to replace it. But this one fit the bill and then some. Heats up really fast and stays hot! Creates a great curl too!</li>
    <li> Great product. The iron heats up quickly and the product can smooth or curl and it holds all day. Nice to use a professional product at home. With the spare spring it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair with just the right amount of wave &amp; lasts all day. Got a good deal on this as well.</li>
    <li> BEST curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have stick straight medium-long hair and this is the first curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had that gives me curls that last ALL DAY with little to no product. I also love the swivel base, which allows you to easily twist it without the cord getting all weird. I had originally ordered the 1 1/4 &#x27;&#x27; iron from Hot Tools, and the curls were so loose that they fell out almost immediately...it&#x27;s surprising how much of a difference a quarter of an inch makes, but the 1 &#x27;&#x27; is really amazing.</li>
    <li> If you want beautiful soft curls you need this curling iron.  Hot Tools is a great brand and his curling iron will last long beyond cheaper brands.</li>
    <li> I had a larger iron like this one and decided to purchase the smaller barrel. Make sure when you order that you measure the width of the barrel, not the circumference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this 1&#x27; curling iron for 2 years now and it still works great! I love the size, it&#x27;s perfect for loose-ish waves in my naturally straight long hair. For the price, the quality can&#x27;t be beat. It does exactly what you need it to, the product lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair (of course there are settings and you need to set it at the correct temp for your own hairtype).</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. I had bought one at Target over a year ago and when it died I went back and Target no longer carried it. I have very straight, coarse hair so I need an iron that gets hot and clamps well and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve owned. I use it every single day and I have very very very thick hair so it gets a work out. I was happy to find a replacement on Amazon and this one is exactly the same as my last one. It works great! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good curling iron with variable heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Now that I&#x27;ve had this curling iron a while, not so crazy about the way it clips the hair, it loosened up a lot, changed pins which they had come with the iron and still does not grab hair and hold it! For what ever reason it is not as good as the one I used to have which was exactly the same? Or at least I thought so!!</li>
    <li> Great curling iron. I love anything hot tools.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only one to keep a curl in my hair for longer than an hour.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is superb!  It works quickly and efficiently.  I love the multi-heat control, especially for my fine hair. I can adjust the heat setting to obtain a solid curl with minimum heat to reduce the risk of damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> The best curling iron I have ever used.  Love the quality and the variable temperature.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. I have really short hair and I like to do a beachy wavy hair and it is perfect for that. It heats up really quickly and it stays hot. Its awesome!!! I would definitely recomment this!!</li>
    <li> Is not easy to use. Got burned. I use a flat iron all the time and never had a problem. Maybe is a good item for a hair dresser.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is a great product! It heats up fast, leaves your hair shinny/glossy, and also works great on African American hair. The one-inch barrel creates the perfect curls for medium-long hair length.  I am very satisfied with this product along with the Hot Tools brand.</li>
    <li> love this little guy! holds curls alllllll day! glad i made this purchase my hair will look perfect on my wedding day</li>
    <li> amazing! best curling iron ever. I want to buy another one because I use it so much its full of hairspray and hair</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. My hair never holds curls, but it does now.</li>
    <li> People rave about this! The one inch is bigger than it should be in my opinion! It dried my hair out very bad! It does not hold curl! Do not buy! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I actually wish it were hotter. Makes nice curls but nothing ridiculously tight or curly. No auto shut-off meant it was left on ALL DAY once. How is there no auto shut-off on all heat products these days?!!!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. It works great, heats up quickly, and the rotating cord makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron, just doesn&#x27;t seem as hot as my last one.</li>
    <li> I heard raging reviews from ladies who work at salons, and amazing feedback online about the hot tools curling irons. I was very excited to receive mine. Everything looked normal, packaging was great.. Heated up quickly. Just when I tried it out, I noticed how it would always leave those crimp marks on my hair. But the worst part, it wouldn&#x27;t even curl my hair! And even if I did get a curl out of it, my hair wouldn&#x27;t hold it. So idk if it&#x27;s just my hair, how I curl my hair the way I do or if it&#x27;s the curling iron. Didn&#x27;t work out for me so I can&#x27;t completely say it would work out for you.</li>
    <li> This works great, I have fine thin hair that never holds a curl and this curls it nicely and the curl last!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve learned through experience that you get what you pay for. DON&#x27;T let the price scare you off! This curling iron will curl your hair as well as the one your stylist uses, even though the price is too good to be true. Listen to the advice about starting on the lowest heat setting, and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The curling iron heats up nicely but the reviews never say what \\&quot;one inch\\&quot; is measuring.  I had no idea so the one inch (diameter) was too big for my short hair.  It might have worked, but the ergonomics are all wrong.  The lever that controls the clamp is short and very high.  One reviewer wrote that it must just be her, but she has to hold the curling iron high on the handle which caused her to accidentally change the heat setting.  One has to hold the iron up at the top of the handle in order to reach the lever - if one can even reach it then.  It took TWO hands for me to hold the curling iron and operate the lever because it&#x27;s just too big of a stretch and the angle seems to be wrong on it.  I do play the piano and can manage octaves on a keyboard, but I do not have \\&quot;large\\&quot; hands by any means.  Perhaps with larger hands it would work for me - but I have this one in my closet ready to donate.  Meanwhile, I purchased a 3/4 inch Remington at Walgreens which did not heat up enough to curl my short hair (!) but it did have a brush that could be slipped on and off - a feature I really liked.  Next I ordered a  3/4 inch Conair  [[ASIN:B000050B6Y Instant Heat Curling Iron, 3/4-Inch]], again from Amazon, which I like very much and,  when desired, the brush from the Remington will stay on the Conair so I can still use it.  If I hadn&#x27;t already invested in two curling irons I probably would have purchased the tourmaline Conair, but did not.  Next time I will know better!</li>
    <li> I have never purchased a non-walmart curling iron before so I was very excited about getting this product. And it did not let me down! The product heats up extremely fast and you can adjust the heat settings according to hair type. Also, the most important thing to me, my curl lasted all day long and it didn&#x27;t appear to be burnt at all. I got the look I wanted without having burnt hair! Its wonderful and I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Works so well I bought one for my sister too! I can curl my hair one day and it looks good the next day... No joke!</li>
    <li> I have only ever owned Hot Tools for myself so when my niece asked for a curling iron, there was no question that I would get her this brand.  I&#x27;m sure she will find it as perfect as I have.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and the 1 inch barrel is perfect for the type of curls I want. Never regret buying this!</li>
    <li> I bought the curling iron for my daughter. She is very happy with the quality and performance. I was very happy with the price and the speed of delivery.</li>
    <li> This iron does a good job for the price. I like that it comes with replacement springs. I used one of the extra springs to repair an older, larger curling iron I have.</li>
    <li> I like the product, because it is warming up very fast, it is curling very nice and i recomend it</li>
    <li> for my daughter she uses it all the time and she says it works very well and still has it at home</li>
    <li> Very fast service and great product.  It does a great job and gives me beautiful curls. It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
    <li> I think it does a good job and the curls stay on for days. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very rarely do beauty products, tools, or implements do exactly as they advertise but this one does.  This iron curls my hair very quickly and the curls hold all day without frizzing.  I do not have to use the highest heat setting, their recommended setting works perfectly well for my hair type, and the results are the best I have ever had with a curling iron.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> It curled really well until 6 months after purchase when it burned my hair off and then just stopped working (wouldn&#x27;t get hot at all when plugged in).</li>
    <li> This is the only curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned, so I don&#x27;t have much comparison. I&#x27;ve only ever owned a flat iron before this. I&#x27;ve had it for a very long time and only use it sparingly. I don&#x27;t like using too much heat on my hair, so when I screw up no heat curls or need to touch them up I&#x27;ll use this. It heats up very quickly and does a good job making the big waves I want. But the curls never last long in my oil prone type 1 hair. an hour or two tops. That&#x27;s with maximum hold hairspray. it&#x27;s about 30 minutes without. I just bought http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C1EMBT6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5 and they work really well. They make the same shape as the damaging heat curler, they just take longer. I still use it sometimes and it&#x27;s a useful thing to have in the beauty arsenal.</li>
    <li> I have had this curling iron for less than a year now, and it&#x27;s just given up the ghost on me - won&#x27;t heat up.  I loved it while I had it, though, except for the fact that I burned the crud out of myself a couple of times.  As others have already stated, it gets very hot!  That worked great for me for the most part, though, because I have very thick hair and wavy, and so many other irons just haven&#x27;t done the trick.  Just wish it had lasted longer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure hot tools irons are normally pretty great, but the one I received from Amazon was awful. First time I used it I turned it on it&#x27;s lowest setting, used heat protectant on my hair, and it completely burned off the section I was trying to curl. My hair is still damaged from it, a year later. Just turned on, it smokes from the tip. It&#x27;s probably a manufacturing problem, as hot tools irons are known to be really great. Just beware, look for smoke, and test it on a very small bottom section in the back first.</li>
    <li> Enfin un fer à boucler qui chauffe très vite, reste bien chaud et fait de magnifiques boucles en un seul passage!&lt;br /&gt;J&#x27;ai dû acheté un mini adaptateur de prise USA-France à moins de 3€ et le tour était joué :)</li>
    <li> I had tried other curling irons, but none of them have worked as well as this one (while still being inexpensive). I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! A friend suggested I try this brand. I am very happy with the results. It curls my hair quickly, even thick pieces at once. Makes curling my hair much less painful. (time wise)</li>
    <li> Perfect look for the loose beauty queen look that is in right now.  We just curl and then finger through our hair.  One inch barrel is perfect for this look.  Love Hot Tools.  Have used them forever!</li>
    <li> I read all the 5 star reviews on this curling iron and I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now regret the purchase, while it does get hot, it does not get hot enough for my hair. I also don&#x27;t recommend this size for loose fat Victorias secret curls. Go with the 1 1/4, and also a different brand. I have heard many good things about Hot tools, but I cannot recommend this curling iron for thick coarse hair. (I can&#x27;t speak for thin hair)</li>
    <li> This was a good curling iron that my 13 year old daughter bought.  Real professional like and solid...and very well priced when my daughter bought it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this brand of styling products. I was impressed after she had used one on my hair, that my hair actually held the curls. So instead of spending a fortune on one in a salon, I found it on Amazon for almost half the price. I use it quite often, and can go all day without touching up my curls. I like that is has the swivel end so the cord doesn&#x27;t get all twisted up. I am very satisfied with this curling iron, I would give it 7 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> This product is wayyy better than the ones sold at drugstore. This curling iron heats up instantly and makes my hair hold the whole day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always heard good things about Hot Tools so when a friend suggested i try one out, i went ahead and bought this. Before this, i used a curling iron from Revlon and this Hot Tools one definitely beats it</li>
    <li> Gets hot quick love it</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron for the price. My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well, but this gets hot enough that my curls will stay in for 2 days (although they are much looser the second day).</li>
    <li> As someone with fragile hair, that has broken off before, I have to be careful about what I use on my hair. Hot tools curling irons are incredible for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;  adjustable temperature&lt;br /&gt;  heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;  curls last all day&lt;br /&gt;  wont damage your hair</li>
    <li> This curling iron heats up amazingly well and fast. I have long, thick hair and it holds it well without pinching and creating creases/dents.</li>
    <li> In love with this curling iron , in the past I have had curling irons that made my hair smell burnt . Not the case with this one</li>
    <li> MY HAIR LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE IT WAS WRAPPED IN A MILLION LITTLE FAIRY CURLERS AND BRUSHED TO PERFECTION. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I will never ever buy another brand of curling iron again.  This one heats up very quickly, has a great temperature control on it, and does a great job curling my hair! Now I understand why my hairdresser has this brand of curler in different sizes right next to her chair.  I highly recommend this curler!</li>
    <li> After all of the rave reviews, I decided to give this one a shot. Not impressed. Heats up fairly quickly, but doesn&#x27;t seem like it gets hot enough nor does it curl very well. If I had more time to spend on my hair, it could possibly be better.</li>
    <li> The curls last! The heating iron heats up quickly. Even when I tie my hair in a loose bun and wake up the next morning my hair has a nice wave with natural looking curls at the end. I have been asked many times if my hair naturally curls.</li>
    <li> this is my second Hot Tools iron and I strongly recommend it.  The product is of exceptional quality and the straight long cord is so much nicer that the typical spiral cords.  Easy to use and makes spectacular curls.  I strongly recommend it~~</li>
    <li> This curling iron works great i love the different settings on it.  My hair is normal thickness and is straight, my only problem is i have a difficult time judging the size barrel that i want for my hair, so for me the curls were slightly smaller than i wanted so i will be getting a bigger barreled curling iron, but still keeping this one.</li>
    <li> Need to get a bigger barrel.</li>
    <li> I had been using a cheapy Conair I had purchased at Target and it worked well, but I heard such great things about the Hot Tools that I figured it would be even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this iron for over 7 months and my hair just wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl with it. Like the bottom layer would be flat before I finished the top.I have thick naturally wavy hair that responds well to heat so I was stumped.  It just didn&#x27;t occur to me it could be the iron since it gets so hot. I thought maybe my hair was getting too long, or it was my shampoo, etc. I started using a ton of product to help hold the curl and nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then all of a sudden a light bulb went off and I pulled out the old cheapy iron and in 10 minutes my entire hair had beautiful waves without any products!  I really can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to figure out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has looked so messy and flat since using this iron. I have no idea why it won&#x27;t work for me since it seems so many people love it, but it just doesn&#x27;t. Going back to the conair.</li>
    <li> Works well on curling my hair</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price. It came late w/shipping so buyer worked w/me on that--much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;It works just as well as the salon one (for $60) I bought 4 years ago that just died on me (expected w/the frequency of use).&lt;br /&gt;Hot tools is simply the best. My hair holds the curl all day and the cord works so you dont get tangled up while curling. Definitely a good purchase!</li>
    <li> Does what it advertises. It works like a professional iron, only doesn&#x27;t cost as much. I love how fast it heats up as well and the super long cord.</li>
    <li> I bought this two, maybe three years ago, and it is honestly the best hair tool I&#x27;ve ever owned. It works incredibly well, heats up super fast (and has a temperature control so you don&#x27;t fry your hair), doesn&#x27;t noticeably damage your hair, it&#x27;s consistently worked for the last three years, and as far as high quality irons go the price is pretty reasonable. As someone who curls her hair pretty much every day and has gone though a lot of curling irons, this is the best one by far. I also do hair and makeup backstage for my school&#x27;s plays, and so I&#x27;ve tested this iron on many different types of hair and it&#x27;s consistently worked on everyone. Other people often bring their irons in, too, and this one works better than all of them, people are constantly coming up to me and asking where I got it and if they can use it. I know people who claim they&#x27;ve never gotten their hair to hold a curl before, and this iron has made their hair curl. It&#x27;s kind of magical. The only annoying thing about it is the cord can get really tangled up, but that&#x27;s not a huge deal. Seriously, buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things to note: I have pretty long hair (about elbow length when wet) so the 1 in barrel works perfectly for me, but I have friends with much shorter hair and it&#x27;s too big for them, it only flips their hair out and doesn&#x27;t curl. If you have a bob or short hair, go for a smaller barrel size.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend not using the clip, too, because you get more natural curls if you don&#x27;t, but if you do want to use it it does come with extra springs if the spring breaks off, although I&#x27;ve never had to use them.</li>
    <li> I read the good reviews and bought it but it burnt my hair. I found it useless and very damaging to hair.</li>
    <li> The problem with this hair curler is in the cord to the curler connection method. This is the second one that has had the same problem, intermittent power when the cord is wiggled. It may be useful for the cord to swivel around, but it is a problematic design. The end of the cord is connected to the iron using two coiled wires that tranmit power. If a break occurs in the cord inside this end then the power is intermittent. Hot Tools refuses to sell a replacement cord which would easily fix the problem since the iron is fine otherwise. Just want you to buy a new one with the same flaw. Look for another brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll caveat this review by saying I&#x27;m not a hair stylist and no nothing as in zip, zilch, nada about the tools used in that profession. However better half has been a stylist for twenty years and serves as Creative Director for one of the top ten Day Spas in the United States - he knows his scissors and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on his feed back Hot Tools are a top choice for professionals for a couple of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* They hold up to commercial use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Have a reliable thermostat which apparently is essential, who knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Solid Warrantee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Comfortable grip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for sizing the one inch is the most popular and any hair stylist worth their salt can make any size curl or wave with the one inch diameter rod. The price on Amazon was the best - beating out even the closed to the general public beauty supply houses that cater only to professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I&#x27;ve found this to be true with virtually all tools of trade and recently bought him a pair of $700 Kamisori shears for $265 with free shipping to boot. As for the curling iron it arrived in it&#x27;s sealed retail packaging and again with a Prime membership you get free two day shipping to boot.</li>
    <li> I normally love hot tools especially as a professional.  My other hot tools have lasted at least two years.  This one however just stopped working on me yesterday.  I plug it in,  switch the on button and it doesn&#x27;t turn on.  It has lasted not even two and half months.  I only use it twice a week to curl my hair. It should of lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works wonderfully</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron and loved it right away. It created great curls that held up very well.  2 weeks after using it, the spring that held the handle in started &amp;#34;sticking&amp;#34; and would only close half way.  I thought maybe it was because it was getting too hot so I did my best to be careful while using it. The problem only got worse until the handle completely jammed and I could not even get it closed.  I was unable to repair it so it&#x27;s just basically sitting useless in my bathroom cabinet. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron.  It heats very quickly, the tip is big enough I don&#x27;t get burned, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  It has a heat control....be sure to watch it.  Too hot might burn your hair and if you drop it it will burn you.  My only wish is that it were smaller because it won&#x27;t leave home without it but it&#x27;s quite large (long) to pack.</li>
    <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t usually use curling irons, she has very straight hair and has only used curling irons a few times in her whole life. She likes the curling iron, but she says it doesn&#x27;t curl as much as she would like, maybe that is because of her lack of experience using a curling iron</li>
    <li> I really like the long cord, and it doesn&#x27;t get tangled. You can choose from different heat settings, so you can save your hair from some damage. The one thing that could use improvement is the on/off switch. I have accidentally bumped it several times and turned it off while curling my hair. It does heat up quickly and I actually own 2 Hot Tools curling irons in different sizes.</li>
    <li> This is a very good choice for a curling iron. It heats up fast and does a wonderful job (:</li>
    <li> Okay. So I&#x27;ve used many hair styling products over the years, especially as my twin is a hair stylist and keeps me up to date on products and such. I&#x27;ve used hot tools in the past and have never had any issues. I even own this same curling iron in a 1.5 inch barrel. The issue I had with this product? The temperature dial was extremely loose. I&#x27;d set it, curl a small section of hair, then when I&#x27;d glance at the temperature, the dial would be all the way in the opposite direction (obviously your hand is going to occasionally lightly nudge the dial when curling). It almost seemed that something was &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; internally. Whatever the case, I cannot fathom keeping a product that I&#x27;d have to apply tape to in order to maintain my desired temperature. Returning. Buying the Paul Mitchell iron with the digital temperature setting. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> After using other irons, I loved that this one had a longer barrel to hold more hair (and long hair) as well as a larger area at the tip to keep you safe from burns. But that&#x27;s where the good review ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for about 2 years, the clip is extremely squeaky (but I think this can be replaced). However, like a few of the reviewers say, the swivel technology of the tangle-free cord eventually causes the power connection to break and render the curling iron useless since the connection becomes very intermittent. At this point, I am just looking for a new iron that will last me longer than 1-2 years.</li>
    <li> Makes very nice curls and seems to be easier on my hair than my last curling iron.  Must be the gold plating?  It also heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I never had a good curling iron, but after hearing that Hot Tools had great irons, I figured I&#x27;d try it out. I had nothing to lose. Now, I can&#x27;t imagine going back to any other curling iron. It heats up fast, and gives me consistant great curls.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. It arrived on time, perfectly packaged, with any damages at all, with the instructions and of course, it left my hair the way I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a video on Youtube of Lauren Conrad using this exact curling iron, that&#x27;s the reason I bought it, and it really worked!&lt;br /&gt;Sooo happy :D</li>
    <li> I really liked this size. I have the bigger one and the curls don&#x27;t last as long. The price was awesome. My sister does hair for a living and she cant get this product for the price I payed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and she loves it, this is compact and easy to carry. Overall a value for money product.</li>
    <li> great iron, get&#x27;s nice and hot and I can do it all in 20 minutes</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever owned!  I love that the heat is adjustable so I can put it at the perfect heat to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fast shipping and it great i love it!</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely straight and curls have never stayed in my hair past an hr or two after curling. But with this the curls stay in my hair up to three days haha. It&#x27;s amazing !! Great product for an amazing price!</li>
    <li> I have had this for less than a year and it just stopped working on me. What I paid...and now to buy another one at full price with warranty (to be safe) I wasted money. Save your money. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> What a HUGE difference this professional curling iron makes!  I never would have believed how much easier the appliance is to use over the discount stores brands (and I&#x27;ve owned most of them!).  This iron is ergonomically perfect!  I have so much control; it provides much more security while gripping and holding the curl.  And my curl:  Holy Mack!  What beautiful, perfect curls it makes.  The price is very reasonable, too.  Didn&#x27;t think I could get excited over a curling iron, but I can&#x27;t say enough about this little darlin&#x27;.  Give it a try - you will NOT be sorry!</li>
    <li> I curl my hair about twice a week. This iron curled my hair in half the time, and lasted twice as long. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy for the money. It&#x27;s gets hot fast and my curls stay all day. I would recommend this to anyone buying a curling tool on a budget.</li>
    <li> My hair usually has trouble holding a curl but this curler does a great job, I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Best in the market happy I bought it. Makes my hair look the way it should fast and easy to handle</li>
    <li> This is the iron my hairstylist used, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since she has more luck with curling my hair than I do...This curler is AMAZING. When it breaks (IF it breaks), I&#x27;m going to keep buying them until I have no more hair left to curl! Love it.</li>
    <li> After recently switching from a flat iron to a curling iron, I have bought and rejected several models based on their designs. So many curling irons have the on/off switch and temp control on the handle, and it was hard to use the irons without accidently turning them off or changing the temps. When I looked at this design, I thought it was a better configuration, and I was right. The settings are placed above the hand grip, and a bonus feature is the swivel cord that moves with you; no more tangled cords to deal with. The heat settings show actual temps, not just a level of heat. All in all, a great iron at a nice price.</li>
    <li> Bought this curling tool because I wanted to make wavy hair for a long time. It is well packaged, clear instructed and easy to use. I have medium to heavy volume of hair in long length. By using this tool, it tooks me about 15-20 mins to finish my look and the result is great! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Still works great, and gets hot really fast. Love the adjustable setting.</li>
    <li> My hair typically does not hold a curl, but it looks amazing when I use this curling iron! My curls typically do fall a little, so I have to make them a little tighter than I actually want. My hair even still looks good the next day!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is the best one i ever bought. It heats up super fast and makes beautiful, celebrity looking curls and stays curly all night. It&#x27;s very cheap and affordable too. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an affordable, good curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best curling iron ever!  It holds my curls all day, even for my stick straight hard to curl hair!  Thinking about buying the 1.25 barrel as well.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> makes nice curly, has a heat setting selection, no complaints, I hate that these require so many words. It just works and great!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t curl my hair using the hot tools.  I tried many times and couldn&#x27;t curl my hair. Only if I choose very tiny tiny hair it works. But if I did that way I would spend more than two hours on my hair before I went outside.</li>
    <li> This curling iron gets very hot and curls my hair great, but during my first use the handle started gradually bending to where i could hardly open the curling iron to get my hair in. So I bent it back up to its original spot, and then could use it normally again. But time after time of bending it back it got weaker to wear the last time i used it I needed to bend it back after every curl and it&#x27;s now starting to crack. I have had it for just over a month. I thought maybe it was just a defective curling iron but then I saw another review that had the same problem.</li>
    <li> I just used this curling iron for the first time and it burned my hair off -- literally. I grabbed one strand of hair, clamped the barrel down and tried to move it down the strand and it stuck. To my horror, it sizzled and melted the hair in the clamp. As I pulled the curling iron away from my hair and it had half the strand melted to it. The entire barrel is now covered with black charred hair that won&#x27;t come off -- think of burning food in a pan on a stove top to the 10th degree. It&#x27;s disgusting. I had the setting on medium - about 380 degrees which is the setting the outside of the box recommends I use given my wavy hair type - and I let it heat up for about 5 minutes before I used it. I have used hair tools for the last 20 years and have never experienced anything like this--I am incredibly disappointed. Now my entire apartment smells horrible, like burnt hair, my hair has two burn marks in it from the barrel and I have a brand new $30 curling iron that is covered in charred hair making it unusable.</li>
    <li> Originally, I loved this iron. However, after a couple of months, it stopped working properly. The light flashes and doesn&#x27;t heat continually, so it was definitely faulty. I contacted the seller and they said they could do nothing about it. So, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> These curling irons are great! Unlike flat irons, they leave my hair bouncy and doesn&#x27;t take away the moisture. Love them!</li>
    <li> This curling iron works really well. It gets hot quickly and is easy to use/maneuver. It is the curling iron that my hair stylist told me to purchase, and I am very happy with it, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Hot Tools is hands down the best brand in hair ironing tools! I always just bought Revelon or Conair or whatever was available at Walmart. But my mother in law is a hair dresser and uses this brand because she buys them at salon stores where only licenced hair dressers can purchase them so she got me a couple different Hot Tools irons and I love them all! I have natural blonde, baby fine hair and i can use it on the highest heat,  which, no kidding, will melt your skin instantly if you accidentally touch your forehead or neck with it. Really you kind of have to let your section of hair cool off before even letting it touch your skin because it comes out soooo hot! The high heat is really made for ethnic hair types, but it makes a good long lasting curl without damage in mine. Wayyyy better than ceramic which always dulled my hair.  Not these tools, they always make hair shiny and smooth. Don&#x27;t be afraid of the highest setting,  one burn and you&#x27;ll quickly learn! But like I said,  I have probably the finest hair type possible and it does not damage. I also use Chi thermal spray 44 iron guard in the red bottle to help protect which does not weigh fine hair down, is not sticky like a setting spray,  and not oily either.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend.  It has heat settings.  Absolutely does the job.  My hair it fabulous.</li>
    <li> Works well I love it! Gets very hot and my hair stays curled for hours!</li>
    <li> Disappointed- did not work as expected . Used only once.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron, I have bought this before. Thanks</li>
    <li> Gets HOT!  Curls last!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this iron because my old one just like this wore out after several years of use.  It is durable, has a nice range of temperature settings to choose from and is easy to handle.  I have never been disappointed with Hot Tools products. It even comes with extra springs. I also like the swivel cord that turns when you maneuver the iron so it doesn&#x27;t get in your way.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended the Hot Tools brand to me. My Mother in law had this awesome curling iron that I used and the name was Helen Of Troy. As reading through other reviews, Helen Of Troy and Hot Tools are the same company. This product works great, heats up very quickly and is easy to handle. I did read some of the negative reviews, I don&#x27;t agree with them. I have not owned the item very long, but it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and the price was WELL worth it. I would certainly recommend this brand to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Great product. I tried different curling irons and this one worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron. Heats up fast and stays hot.</li>
    <li> I have bought three of these over 5 years as I am hard on my hair tools with travel and all&lt;br /&gt;They work awesome but I PREFER THE purple barrel kind to this one, seems to get and stay hotter longer&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo this one works like a charm but I let it heat up for yes, 20 minutes first!&lt;br /&gt;To get it its hottest, this seems to work so keep it away from little hands while its heating up&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for anyone who loves curling hair, with longer lasting curls&lt;br /&gt;The hotter you let it get the better the curls stay-especially if you add noodle head before hand :)</li>
    <li> Amazing! Beautiful curls! I ordered this for my USA holiday and My only wish is that I could use it back in Australia!!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. Really great product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with any Hot Tools brand of curling irons. :)</li>
    <li> Best curling iron I have every owned</li>
    <li> Great and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Everything I wanted without a bag to store it in.</li>
    <li> just gotta learn how to use it correctly but its still awesome anyway!!!! totally worth your money! (why is this making me write more?)</li>
    <li> i bought this for my daughter, who happens to be very picky. since she&#x27;s happy with it, i&#x27;m also happy,</li>
    <li> Price was good and shipping was fast and free.  I was totally satifisied with original unit which lasted many years so I was very pleased that I found it on my favorite shopping site (Amazon).</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron for my wife, she owned one prior to this one. This curling iron lasted just over 5yrs. (with fine medium length hair) It comes with an extra spring. I can speak for my wife on this matter, GREAT BUY! She loves it! How fast it heats up, also many heat settings. We.... Or she, highly recommends this product. She loved it so much when the old one was wearing out, I bought two online. That way she has a backup.</li>
    <li> I keep ordering the Hot Tools curling iron because it&#x27;s a fabulous tool when it works, but I&#x27;ve found it to be a bit temperamental. The first one worked fine, but the black plastic on the clip cracked and fell off, requiring a duct tape fix (until it melted and I had to order a new one). The second one worked fine until, after about nine or ten months of daily use, the thermostat stopped working properly. I had to crank it up to high (not great for my fine hair) to get it to heat at all. But (sigh), I&#x27;ve ordered another one because the design is great and when it works, it works. Let&#x27;s hope the third time&#x27;s the charm!</li>
    <li> I just love this curling irons!! I&#x27;ve been using it for years, just store it carfully, the plastic cover on the handle can broke!</li>
    <li> This is a nice curling iron - light weight, but makes grat holding curls. I like the different heating temperatures, and the way it feels while curling my hair.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I chose this curling iron. When I try to curl a strand of hair it does not glide. I have to hold the handle slightly open to get it through my hair. Big pain. It&#x27;s also easy to turn it off when you&#x27;re using it. Another big pain.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I had planned on buying the Hot Tools iron that didn&#x27;t lock so I could make the &amp;#34;beachy waves&amp;#34; look. So at first I was disappointed in myself. It didn&#x27;t last long. These irons are such a high quality, the same ones you will see most stylists use, and what a great price! The cheap ones from Target that break after a few months are more money and nowhere near the quality of these. I kept it and so glad I did.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron.  I had my last one for over 10 years and loved it so was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t another metal like one that didn&#x27;t torch my fine hair.  It seems salon like so for $26 was a steal!  Great cool tip and spins effortlessly.  heats quickly!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly, curls beautifully and my curls last ALL day! This seriously NEVER happens. Better than the $200 irons for sale in the salon. BUY THIS, YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same curling iron my hair dresser uses, so I wanted to use it replicate her handiwork. I couldn&#x27;t, since I&#x27;m inept with a curling iron, but I hope to get better soon.  It&#x27;s a great hair tool, works exactly as advertised and makes great curls.&lt;br /&gt;I received the package through prime and had no issues.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have purchased this line many times in the past and have always been satisfied. The adjustable heating control makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling iron back in September and the power control switch broke after 3 months of use.  It is a little switch that you push forward and back to turn on or off and when I try to move it to the on part it just won&#x27;t activate the curling iron.  I use it everyday, but hardly would consider this good enough reason for the most important part of the curling iron to stop working.  I would not purchase this item again.  Curling irons I have used in the past lasted way longer than 3 months THEY LASTED YEARS....they shouldn&#x27;t have such a sensitive switch!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother cause she loved mine and was using it. The cord is why I bought this cause it dosn&#x27;t tangle like others, and curls nicely.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this curling iron based on the suggestion by Cara at maskcara.com.  She uses the Hot Tools brand in all her tutorials.  This product arrived quickly and is excellent.  It heats up fast and stays hot.  The black tip at the end of the iron is great to hold onto while curling hair.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had a curling iron of this same brand for about 10 years, it was a wonderful iron, but the spring finally broke. I bought a replacement at Sally&#x27;s, but I would not recommend buying anything there. It was expensive and a piece of junk! I tried to return it, apparantely customer satisfaction is not important to a company that sells low quality junk. I came home and ordered this iron on Amazon for half the price, what a delight this curling iron is. It heats up wonderfully, has a nice long barrel and even came with extra springs. I&#x27;ll bet this one lasts 20 years!!! :) If you are in the market for a curling iron you won&#x27;t be dissappointed, but don&#x27;t shop at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> My old iron was iffy about starting when I pushed the on button so it was time to get a new one - I&#x27;m so glad I picked this one!  I don&#x27;t know what is different about it but the curl holds so much better than my old iron for some reason - i don&#x27;t even need hairspray anymore!</li>
    <li> My old curling iron was dead one morning so I started shopping for a replacement-chose this and it has been a good choice for me</li>
    <li> Granted I had not replaced my curling iron in many years, when I finally did, I went with this one.  I find this to be a great buy.  The various heat settings really help each person determine how much is required to accomplish their curls, without overdoing the heat and causing damage.  The barrel size is nice and the swivel chord is heavy sent as it does not get tangled during use.  Love this!</li>
    <li> My hair is SO hard to curl and I had given up trying to make it curl until I ordered this and tried it today, it is AMAZING, perfect curls that hold really well and take mere seconds to form in this awesome curling iron!</li>
    <li> Have been using a straightener for many years for my curly hair.  Wanted to try a more natural/wavy look so bought this curling iron (after having read about in In Style magazine.) Works like a charm and have not used my straightener since.</li>
    <li> This curling iron heats up quickly and gives me great curls that last all day! I want to get the bigger barrel so I can make bigger curls but this one does great for medium sized curls. It also handles a lot of hair at once. I love it!</li>
    <li> First one I received had a broken switch (stayed ON all the time), but Amazon replaced it free of charge for me, and the second one works great!  I&#x27;ve had this model before and they get really nice and hot.  Can do your whole head very quickly without having to wait for the rod to keep reheating.</li>
    <li> This curler gets REALLY hot, and it handles my generally straight hair really well. I use it all the time, and it wasn&#x27;t even that expensive for how well it works!</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my sister, i haven&#x27;t used it yet, but delivery was fast. and it looks professional. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have owned and discarded many curling irons over the years and this is the best curling iron that I have ever owned. The heat settings are in actual degrees. The size is right and you can do a lot with it once you play around and experiment. My biggest thrill was to see that they include replacement springs for when the iron becomes inoperable due to mechanical wear and tear on the punchy-grabber mechanism which is known to eventually poop out on all curling irons of this type.  Now this is a company that actually wants you to enjoy their product! Nothing says commitment to a customer like addressing a known issue before it occurs. Nice to see that someone cares out there and put in the effort to market a stellar product.</li>
    <li> AWFUL EXPERIENCE!  Used curling iron for the first time on low heat and FRIED my hair right off! The second time I tried to turn it on, it no longer heated up. Must have been a short in the curling iron or it was defective. I&#x27;m out the money I paid since it was opened from the package &amp; still don&#x27;t have a working curling iron...Will never purchase Hot Tools again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thinning hair and the regular curling irons I have been using left my hair flat and whatever curl was there, left immediately.  This curling iron does manage to make a good, lasting curl.  I was very concerned about the heat intensity, but I have it smack, dab in the middle and it works just fine.  I do like the swivel cord--makes maneuvering it around the head nice and easy.  It has a strong spring and I do like the indentation in the tip.  It allows me to put a finger in it for better control.  I know some people remarked about the dial, but I don&#x27;t find it moves--it stays exactly where I put it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my great nephew and I understand that he and his younger sister absolutely love playing with this. He is 5 years old and his sister is 4.</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron...very hot and just the right size!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is the one that my hair stylist uses. I could not be more pleased. I have a $100 one that doesn&#x27;t work as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for years.&lt;br /&gt;It gets hot enough for all hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;It is super easy to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;It heats up super quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super thin hair have not seen any damage.&lt;br /&gt;I also have extensions and this works great with those too.&lt;br /&gt;My best friend has really thick hair and steals it all the time too; she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can not go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> I adore this curling iron. It curls great. I have curly hair texture so I usually straighten before curling . It has great heat settings as well. Great shipping.</li>
    <li> Works great .. good value</li>
    <li> I have had this iron for many years when it finally broke on the clamping mechanism. I searched and found this!!! Same as my old one. I love love this. Its the perfect fit in the hand, does a great curl, quickly heats. i will be buying another so my daughter does not steal!</li>
    <li> the spring is kind of stiff, but that is because it is new. I like the overall look and feel.</li>
    <li> I bought this because its supposed to be the best out there. It heats very quickly and curls nice BUT I was very disappointed to see that while I&#x27;m curling my hair, the clip handle BENDS!  I have to constantly bend it back to its original position or it won&#x27;t open as wide as it should.  I&#x27;ve never had to do this to another curling iron.  I thought I was getting the best...</li>
    <li> Heats fast and is by far the best curing iron I&#x27;ve owned.  The curls stay all day.  The swivel cord keeps the cord from being tangled which is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> the picture has the purple authenticity of hot tools and mine didnt. And every thing about is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My mom had purchase this curling iron back in 2005 and to now it has worked amazing. It has dropped many times, I mean do the math from 2005 to 2013 &amp; we probably use 2-3 times a week and we got a new puppy who unfortunate ripped the cord so here I had to order a new one and this looks nothing like the original it doesnt glide easily like the other one &amp; I know it should because I have a few other and ALL of them slide easily when curling it. So im not to convince this is the real one I will do my research and see if this is a knockoff I hope not or else ill be returning it I will come back and update you guys if it is</li>
    <li> works really well. heats up really fast BUT maybe too fast sometimes.  burned myself couple times, not gonna lie but other than that, its a really good curler.. hopefully i can practice some more and end up with pretty curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY this!</li>
    <li> I have a new short haircut which requires more attention than I&#x27;ve ever given my hair. My stylist walked me through each step and finally added that I needed to get a curling iron with... all of the attributes this iron has. I&#x27;m very pleased. It gets hot and offers lots of heat options.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside... which is my fault is I should have gotten the 3/4&amp;#34; barrel for my short hair. This barrel is a big too jumbo for me but it works.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love these curling irons!  My stylist uses them in her salon, and on her recommendation, I bought two sizes. They are the best I have ever found.  Quality product that works well and does not damage my hair.  Great value at this price, I highly recommend this line of curling irons.</li>
    <li> I am on my third one of these curling irons, and it&#x27;s annoying that they so easily break... I like that it gets hot enough to curl my stubbornly straight hair without damaging it (unlike any other curling iron I&#x27;ve tried), but the spring easily breaks. Even though it comes with spare springs, shouldn&#x27;t the company know that if you have to include spares then the springs need to be fixed and repaired for future models? Also, I lent my second one (bought here on Amazon) to a friend for half an hour and when she gave it back, it no longer heated past 100 degrees. I don&#x27;t know if she dropped it or what, but to break a second one so easily after owning it for 3 months is startling and aggravating. When they wouldn&#x27;t replace it through the Ulta store where I bought it or through the Hot Tools website, I decided to buy a third one simply because I absolutely had to have one for an event that night... but I wish I would have just spent the money the first time for the Chi curling iron and avoided this whole mess.</li>
    <li> This is the iron we use in our salon! Love it great product! Love that the cord doesn&#x27;t really tangle.</li>
    <li> Secure packaging and quick shipping. I was greatly pleased with my purchase. Would buy from this seller again. Curling iron is great for full and soft waves. I use it often and love the length of the cord.</li>
    <li> When my hair was shorter, I used the Hot tools brush curling iron, which was about 12 years old.  I grew my hair out to a chin length bob, and coudn&#x27;t use it anymore.  Too much tangling.  I really didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for a new iron, so I just picked up a Conair.  I used it for a year, with OK results.  It was wearing out, and needed to be replacedd, so I decided to try the Hot Tools again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin, fine, and straight.  The difference was surprising.  With the Conair, the volume and slight curl was gone in a few hours.  Using the same volumizer and hairspray, the volume and curl lasted all day with the Hot Tool iron.  I actually use less hairspray.  I would recommend this product.  It is worth the extra money, and it is a much better quality iron.  I will never waste my money on the cheaper irons.</li>
    <li> Such a good curling iron curls last all day. I love this iron and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it you should definitely try it!</li>
    <li> This curling iron heats up very fast!!!  The curls last all day :))  The added touch is having a longer cool tip to control the wand.  Totally satisfied with the tool and with the super quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast! I love that you can pick the heat setting for your type of hair. It was very easy to use and I got beautiful curls that lasted all day.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this curling iron. Works great love the cord and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how it works with my hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but I have unruly hair</li>
    <li> I have had this iron for 4 years. Multiple times my stupid self has left it on for 24 hours or more at a time and it still works amazing.  gets hot fast and does beautiful smooth curls!!</li>
    <li> Great product and it gets hot in a matter of seconds which is great when your in a hurry or being rushed by someone.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for a friend.  This was the best price on the internet and the delivery was fast.  My friend gave the product rave reviews and seems to be very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Seriously, for my hair that normally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl I can&#x27;t go wrong with Hot Tools! Use it almost daily!</li>
    <li> My hair has to grow before I can use it.</li>
    <li> I liked this curling iron so much that I am in the process of replacing all of my different sized irons with this brand.</li>
    <li> I like this curler, definitely makes pretty, soft curls and the temperature adjustment is a nice option. The curls, however, don&#x27;t last super well, the ends especially seem to fall straight pretty quickly. However, really solid, good curler, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still working good, after 3 years or purchase.</li>
    <li> I have thick, dark, straight, asian hair and I&#x27;ve gone through several brands of curling irons. My curls never stay for longer than a few minutes. Hot Tools is amazing. I can tell as soon as I curl my hair that the curls are intact. I also often smell the faint burnt-hair odor with other curlers, but not this one. It heats up fast. Best part is, it&#x27;s way cheaper than some other brands I tried! I&#x27;ve used this curler about once a week for 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have no complaints about it other than it doesn&#x27;t have auto-shutoff, which most curlers don&#x27;t anyway. I got the 1&amp;#34; for my shoulder-length hair and wish I had gotten the 1-1/4&amp;#34; or 1-1/2&amp;#34; for looser waves but that&#x27;s no complaint about the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;-Fast heat-up&lt;br /&gt;-Temperature setting rather than ambiguous number scale&lt;br /&gt;-No burnt smell&lt;br /&gt;-Good for thick hair&lt;br /&gt;-Curls/waves stay for 3 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-No automatic shut-off</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Nothing more, nothing less. It gets the job done. .</li>
    <li> Totally in love with this curling iron.  The curls are beautiful and last all day!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this iron to supplement my 3/4, which was just a little too small. The 1 inch is great and I use it almost everyday. Heats up really fast and gets super hot. I would recommend starting on a lower temp and working your way up, or start like I did and start on the highest and work you way down! :) Would definatly buy again and it&#x27;s been about a month and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far~</li>
    <li> I like everything about this curling iron except the cord is too long and the stand is too hard to move. I have to use the edge of my counter top to push on the stand to fold it up to curl my hair. Then I have to use a pen to unfold it so I can place the curling iron on the counter. If the stand was coated in something so it wouldn&#x27;t be hot to the touch, then I would be fine with it. The other thing that I would like to comment on is the temperature settings. I find that somewhere in the middle is all you need so why do they offer so many? Another thing that I noticed is that when I try to place a small amount of hair in the iron, it just slides out or when I put the normal amount of hair in, some of it will fall out. All of my curling irons in the past haven&#x27;t had this problem. I have been using curling irons for 32 years!</li>
    <li> I have never had a Hot Tools item before, but it was worth the little extra money. I bought it to replace my old Conair curling iron. This iron heats up much faster, keeps the temperature better and my hair holds the curl longer. So glad I bought a Hot Tools product.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd of this specific curling iron that I&#x27;ve purchased. The first one I had for about 6 years before I dropped it too many times and it finally quit working. I love it though! My hair holds the curl the best when curled with this iron, and I don&#x27;t even use product. It relaxes a little throughout the day, but I like it like that. I use it on the highest heat setting and have no problems. My hair is about average I think, not way thin but not thick either. I hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this curling iron for quite some time and I love it! It heats up very quickly and gives beautiful curls!</li>
    <li> I just got this curling iron and so far am very pleased with it.  It was a great price and the quality is above average.  The clamp is nice and tight so the hair doesn&#x27;t slip out.  I had that issue with my last iron.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly.  My hair does not typically hold a curl well and this iron is one of the few that I&#x27;ve found that works.  Price is much better than other &amp;#34;industry&amp;#34; brands.</li>
    <li> I have unmanageable, frizzy, thick, wavy hair. This is the first curling iron I have ever used that consistently gives me nice clean curls. I use a heat protectant before, and I use hairspray after. These curls always last a long period of time, but they definitely don&#x27;t take long to make. It cut the time to curl my hair down by 50%, and I get better looking, longer lasting curls. I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I have used couple times and I love it. This is the best curling iron that I ever had, thanks.</li>
    <li> Is that too much to say about a product?  Maybe not!  I have long, thick hair that is very unruly.  I was unable to ever get curls to stay in my hair until I bought this product.  Now it takes, seriously, 8 minutes for me to curl my waist-length hair.  The curls stay with a small amount of hairspray.  I was never able to do my hair and now I can.  I get many complements on my new waves!  Maybe not life changing, but definitely great.</li>
    <li> They actually sent me hot curlers instead when I ordered this curling iron expecting to get it. i was a little dissapointed when i recieved the curlers but don&#x27;t want to go the the hassel of shipping it back and i will just keep my wrong item...</li>
    <li> I love all my hot tools products and this is no different. Always a very reliable iron and if I keep up, I will eventually have every size barrel!</li>
    <li> Too hot for my hair! Can&#x27;t imagine who could use this tool though I gave it to my grand daughters who have long hair and lots of it.</li>
    <li> its great!!! It held my curls for three days! it does get reallllllllly hot. I have very fine/thin hair. lowest setting was best for me.  I went on a search to find the best curling with the best reviews and after using several other kind, I highly recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Great curling iron.  Gets hot very fast!  We love the temperture control too.</li>
    <li> The size is good, which I expected.  The manner in which the hair wraps around the cylinder is great.  With short hair it is sometimes difficult to get it where I want it on the curling iron and to keep it there.</li>
    <li> Well, this heats up quickly (sizzle...ouch). This is actually for my girlfriend who has amazingly thick, perfect hair (Japanese). She usually has a hard time doing anything with her hair due to its abundance and thickness, however, she did to her surprise make a curl! Sold! Enjoy this product!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Delivery was fast and it curls my hair perfectly!!</li>
    <li> Love it, the cord doesn&#x27;t twist. It allows you to move the curling iron easily.</li>
    <li> This curling iron curls my fine, thin hair really well! My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut-off if you accidentally leave it on. Not a big deal, but I have left it on all day a couple times...</li>
    <li> WOW. I could literally go on and on about this, but I will keep it brief. I LOVE THIS IRON. Period. My hair is quite long, quite thick and NEVER HOLDS A CURL (even with mounds of hairspray!) I lost hope, until I purchased this. Perfect 1inch voluminous, lasting BEAUTIFUL curls that stay in my hair ALL DAY! I use it everyday and get so many compliments on my hair now! So happy!(:</li>
    <li> My sister also has this, it works great.. Cant think of any issues! Be careful tho i already burned my arm lol (bad technique) love how it works</li>
    <li> This is a great product it you have shoulder length to long hair. It gives a nice soft wave or a nice defended curl. You can style your hair anyway using this great tool that has different temps.</li>
    <li> I just loooove this curling iron! It makes your hair look so sexy! ;)</li>
    <li> The curling iron heats up very quick. Its perfect for my thick hair. It makes really nice waves/curls. I would recomend this (:</li>
    <li> Just had to throw an old one of these away. The springs stopped working properly. However, good news!! The new irons come with replacement springs just in case. This must have been an issue with older models. This iron is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t burn the hair and gets really hot. A super long cord, too.  I have long hair and this 1 inch works fantastic with curls. I would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this brand and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!  Heats quickly and price was very reasonable!  HIghly recommend.</li>
    <li> Hot tools brand is a great bang for your buck. I&#x27;ve used Conair curling irons for years and have tried expensive brands as well but these irons are awesome. It heats up quickly and can be used as  curling wand if you turn the temperature down a little.</li>
    <li> This iron drags through my hair.  It did come with two extra spring clips which blew my mind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a quality curling iron, always the drug store junk.  Worth every dime!  I recommend this to friends and family</li>
    <li> Was looking to replace my old Hot Tools curling iron....Amazon had the best price.  This product works perfectly and I would order it again.  It really holds the curl and have had a great experience using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this curling iron for years. Have to replace it about every 2 years or so but worth it. My hair is very thin and does not hold a curl well so this is the best for my hair type :)</li>
    <li> The quality of this product was above average for me,  but for the price,  it was great. But even on the lowest setting, it felt like it was too hot. Heats up fast and curls great. Great for beginners like me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for people with fine or delicate hair though. Overall,  a great product for styling</li>
    <li> This curling iron was able to put a curl in my hair and make it stay all day without anything but hairspray. I have straight very silky hair and it will not do anything unless I load it up with hair product. Maybe this curling iron gets really hot, or the plating makes a difference, all I know is it works!</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever had!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. But I had to give it 4 stars because the one I bought before this...the springs snapped off after the 4th time using it.</li>
    <li> Girls if you don&#x27;t have it you need it.  I never realized what a difference it could make in your hair by choosing a quality product.</li>
    <li> It works great and the curls stay in!  Also love that they sent extra springs.  I would definitely recommend this curling iron!</li>
    <li> Hot tools has been my favorite brand for a long time now!  I love the curling iron. It gets hot and stays hot ! the 1 inch is a good size for medium size curls. I also have a 1 3/4 inch one and that is more for a body wave. This curling iron will last you a long long time if you keep up with cleaning (alcohol wipe every now and then) and put it away properly. Great great product!</li>
    <li> heats up quickly, does great job on curls.  Easy to use. Definately recommend, met my expectations. Received the new product quick, undamaged.</li>
    <li> I love Hot Tools. I bought it because I saw my hair stylest using it! It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair when I used a heat protectant with it!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product!!! Best curling iron that I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron after getting recommendations from several friends, including professional stylists. With my first (smaller barrel) iron I ignored this advice and purchased one with a tourmaline ceramic barrel, in attempts to protect my hair. I have long, baby-fine hair and maybe ceramic better for my hair, but the curl really didn&#x27;t hold. This hot tools iron still doesn&#x27;t work wonders, but if I&#x27;m really concerned about the curl holding I can crank the heat way up on this bad boy. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months but I&#x27;ve used it probably once a week and I&#x27;ve had no issues so far!</li>
    <li> It works and I like it. I wish it had more heat power but I can&#x27;t complain. Very good curling iron for the price.</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best curling irons I have ever owned, very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> bought as a gift for a grand workkks very well so far</li>
    <li> I needed a curling iron with more heat, which the Hot Tools Professional delivered.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love it.  so do my friends when they come over!!</li>
    <li> love it love so easy to use</li>
    <li> I love Hot Tools Professional brand.  I have this curling iron in several sizes.  I have shoulder length, straight hair and this is the perfect size to give my hair some waves and volume.</li>
    <li> So easy to use, I&#x27;m glad I went with this curling iron. I can see why it&#x27;s so popular.</li>
    <li> Wife wanted a new &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; curling iron. She said a nice one would be expensive so I hesitated buying this one even though it had great reviews. I bought it for her just because. It was a suprise gift and she loves its. She still tells me she loves it. I can understand why, her curls have never looked this good before. She likes the features and how it works. Five stars from me.</li>
    <li> Disappointing in many ways. While the handle grip is strong, it ends of creating these creases that I don&#x27;t like to see on my hair. I don&#x27;t understand how this produce received such high ratings from so many users. This size is definitely for super curly, curly fry styles. If you would like more loose wavy curls, this is NOT the produce you would want to get. I still opt for my super old curler when I want to add some volume and bounce to my hair.</li>
    <li> Item was just what I expected and works great! I love it and everyone who has used mine has loved it.</li>
    <li> I have several of these same products in different sizes. I have paid nearly double for the exact same product in local beauty supply stores. This is a great buy for the price and quality.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s it, I ordered a 1&#x27;&#x27; curling iron but I got a 3/8&#x27;&#x27; and I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s already out of the US so it isn&#x27;t under guarantee anymore.  I didn&#x27;t knew they sent me the wrong size until it was in my hands here, in my country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, the thing works perfectly.  I already bought a 1 1/2&#x27;&#x27; and it is amazing, I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those 2 stars are because now I have to wait for another chance that some acquaintance goes to the US, so as I will buy another curling iron (hoping they send me the right one this time...) and this person will bring it to me when they are back in the country... but only God knows when will that be... ¬¬ Damn you, Hot Tools people and thank you, by the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH!! :S</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. This is the only curling iron I have ever got to curl my hair and hold it. I have long thick hair and this works amazing!</li>
    <li> Works good.  Curls don&#x27;t hold as long as I was hoping. My curling wand holds a lot better and they are supposed to be about the same temp. I would buy again though.  Good price for the product.</li>
    <li> Livraison très rapide trez bon produit</li>
    <li> this curling iron is awesome. i am a low maintenance person and probably only curl my hair about once a week. this curling iron makes the task very quick &amp; easy. maintains very high heat and is easy to maneuver. will buy another hot tools iron if i ever need a different size, etc.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, long slim insulated cord makes it easy to maneuver. My curls stay all day which rarely happened with my old iron,  Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Hot Tools 1\\&quot; Curling Iron to use on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair. I have coarse, wavy hair and she has fine hair. I read many of the reviews before purchasing and thought I knew what to expect. To keep a long story short, of the 5 times the curling iron was used, it burned hair 3 of those times. The first 2 times it did not burn hair because the heat was under 300 degrees - it also did not curl the hair. I never had the heat higher than 380 degrees. Product  to protect hair was used each time. Also there was constant smoke coming out of the \\&quot;cool tip\\&quot; each time it was used. I was told by my hair stylist this is normal for a new curling iron. There were so many positive reviews for this item that I can&#x27;t help but feel this one may be defective. I did read the brief manuel that came with the product and even brought it to my hairstylist to show me what I was doing wrong. I am so disappointed and think I&#x27;m out $30.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is worth every penny! Heats up really fast and provides a curl that lasts all day long. Will definitely purchase again from Hot Tools!</li>
    <li> Had this for about 3 months! Its amazing! Perfect curls every time and it heats up super fast! I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a low cost curling iron! Beats the 100 dollar curling irons out there!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron, it gets super hot quick and the swivel cord makes it really nice and easy to use, shipping was quick.</li>
