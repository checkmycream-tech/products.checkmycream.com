<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great little trimmer. cant beat the price and it has a solid feel to it. unlike those pen sized trimmers.</li>
    <li> It just isn&#x27;t possible to get the blades close enough to my skin. For whatever reason,  hairs have decided to grow on my ears.  I think it&#x27;s an old guy thing,  but I hate it.  This trimmer  is fine for those pesky nose hairs.  A little stubble in my nose isn&#x27;t visible,  but this trimmer just can&#x27;t get close enough on my ears. I suspect it&#x27;s designed that way intentionally to prevent lawsuits from dullards who have de-eared themselves,  and I get that.  But this trimmer is just too safe to be effective at what many men will need it to do.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well, and is a great buy for the money. If you use the timmer for an extended period of time, the tip will become hot and bother the sensitive inside of your nose. However, this is rarely an issue for me.</li>
    <li> a handy object to have and a good price everyone needs one</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for a very fair price. No unnecessary frills that you don&#x27;t need to pat for.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to and is easy to clean. I would recommend this to anybody wanting to trim nose hair. Have not used it on any ear hair, so can&#x27;t say on that. Battery operated, so easy to use. Haven&#x27;t had to recharge/replace batteries yet and have used it 3 or 4 times.</li>
    <li> i have tried once or twice and so far it is good.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price, does its job fine. People should know that this is as important as a toothbrush for everyday personal care...</li>
    <li> Not as good as my last trimmer but it does the job</li>
    <li> Works great, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Not a bad performer, but it quit after about a year. Yet another example of poorly made Chinese crap. I would not buy another.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I don&#x27;t have much to compare to because I haven&#x27;t used an other nose-hair trimming product.  I&#x27;ve always just tried to make due with the beard trimmer on my electric razor.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and it&#x27;s designed so you don&#x27;t have to be careful with it.  Very difficult to cut or hurt yourself.  Even so, it still gives one a close trim.</li>
    <li> Works perfect.  it´s great that you can wash the tip in water.  Very fast and doesn´t hurt your nose.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> Simply does poorly at getting nose hairs. It&#x27;s clear just looking at the tip that it will not work. I would return it, but I&#x27;ve already stuck it up my nose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far, and it tickles, but i THINK it works haha. I don&#x27;t have any of those little hairs sticking out anymore so I guess thats good right?</li>
    <li> The round head trimmer does not trim as closely nor does it work as thoroughly as the old time version with flat trim heads</li>
    <li> Far better than my old trimmer!!</li>
    <li> A much needed replacement!</li>
    <li> Does a very poor job. Back to manually trimming for me. :(</li>
    <li> I bought this because my husband had an older nose trimmer and I admit I use it once in awhile.  His old one works way better than this one does so I was a little disappointed in the performance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought, over the years, over ten nose/ear trimmers and have thrown all of them away except this one.  It works exceptionally well and you can hardly feel it when you are using it.  I am very, very happy with this trimmer and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Trimmer worked really well the first time I used it. Unfortunately that was the only time I used it, since after that it simply stopped working. I thought it may have to do with the battery, but I&#x27;ve tried several types and this thing simply doesn&#x27;t start. Have had to get a Wahl kit instead, which is working fine and had the clipper and nose trimmer for the same price as this Norelco. Really disappointed in Philips for such poor quality.</li>
    <li> I get a trimmer once a year. These work really well, despise the fact cylindrical tip. It gets my nose hair, my eyebrows, and the hair on my ears. I go from a beast to a B rated prince in 10 minutes. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> bought this to replace another brand that died. Small, clean and efficient, works like a charm and easy to use!</li>
    <li> This is really a disappointing purchase for me.... At first, I&#x27;d thought the price was good, and also, made by a reputable manufacturer like Philips Norelco. However, depends on what you buy it for - mine is mainly for nose trimming, the vibrating head is simply way too thick to slide into the inside of your nostrils that you otherwise would need a safety scissors to cut it. I bought it and stopped using after only a few tries due to my frustration. I&#x27;ve since bought a Remington from my local CVS that works way better...</li>
    <li> Eh - this model is not as good or effective as slightly more expensive models in terms of cutting efficiency or comfort.</li>
    <li> it does what it is suppose to do...trim hair.it wont give u a crew cut but it will trim your ears and nose and wont empty your wallet</li>
    <li> This product is made with a cheap/defective blade assembly likely made in China that stops working after a few months. I am on on my 3rd replacement from last year.  This will be the LAST product I ever purchase from Philips, I have no confidence buying their electronics anymore.</li>
    <li> Awesome device. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Worse trimmer I ever bought. Every once in a while I pull it out to give it another chance and it goes right back into the drawer. Save your money and get something else.</li>
    <li> I had a different trimmer long time ago. It was good as well but it did not had a replaceable AA battery but rather had a built in rechargeable battery where you can plug it in and use it or recharge the trimmer and use it. But I love this one a lot. I can wash the head in running water and don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it overnight or to find a electoral outlet to use it. I can just change the AA battery when the battery is drained.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is suppose to do, and what I bought it for. Very happy. Think I will give them out for Christmas to all the old men I know.</li>
    <li> Works great. Does a nice job. The battery lasts a long time. Would order this product again. Bought to replace a very old one that finally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So far it does a great job!</li>
    <li> The tip is too small for much hair to get into it. I would NOT recommend this product - I now have to buy a different one.</li>
    <li> The price is reasonable and is a great way to stay well groomed. I would recommend this product to anyone that appreciated good value for hard earned money.</li>
    <li> My old one gave up the ghost.  Eventually I tried this one, and found it works better than the old one did back when it was new.</li>
    <li> The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I&#x27;m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.</li>
    <li> This item actually came with batteries, but just after installing them &amp; testing the motor, I dropped it. The metal cylinder&#x27;s top teeth were bent &amp; the blade would no longer turn, so I had to throw it away. Norelco makes great electric razors- I&#x27;ve used them for over 40 years, but we can&#x27;t expect high tensle strength steel in something that sells for less than $10!</li>
    <li> This is my first trimmer, and I was hesitant. It is easy to use, efficient, quiet, not painful, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It gets hot if you use it for more than a minute, I&#x27;m also not sure if its trims the hair properly</li>
    <li> Looks like much better quality in person, this trimmer is the best one I&#x27;ve used, I like how you can wash it off with water, it&#x27;s compact with a lid, definitely recommend this to anyone just needing a nose trimmer not very loud either and feels almost like heavy duty</li>
    <li> It works great and is affordble..good brand</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well at all.</li>
    <li> It has more power than my old one. I bought a second one for different location.</li>
    <li> It works just like it is supposed to.  Trims without pulling and does a very neat and precise job.  As far as how long it will last, I will have to update, but it seems well built.</li>
    <li> it was a necessary (must have)  i decided to buy because of the brand and it does a fine job for me anyway i saw many similar cheaper...</li>
    <li> This unit works very well.  It&#x27;s relatively quiet and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important: this device painlessly slices the hairs.  The previous brand I owned from a certain specialty retailer was more of a torture device.</li>
    <li> Hairy noses are no more at our house. This is such a great grooming tool. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> This is just ok! The price was nice, but you definetly get what you pay for. It just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to it. You have to hit the hair just right in order for it to work.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband and it works quite well.</li>
    <li> Had had one of these a few years back, it died so I thought I would replace it with a new model. This unit just doesn&#x27;t have the same trimming ability.You have to attack one hair at a time, it takes a bit with just one hair. I guess I would say the the unit will work, I had more expectations since I had a Philips before</li>
    <li> only used for a few times, seems ok, will leave certain short length.....not cut deep. easy to clean and store.</li>
    <li> I finally reached an age I need to manage my nose hair and was hoping for something to aid in that.  This feels as though it would make a better vibrator than an actual hair manager.</li>
    <li> Great trimer. Trusted Norelco name brand. Works well, but does not trim nasal hairs very close. No matter how hard I press, it still does not trim hairs as short as I&#x27;d expected in another trimmer I had. I have to use a nail scissors with  rounded end tip to cut nasal hairs shorter after using this trimmer. Great item, just not a close cut, as I had expected. Keeping it.Convenient to use and came with batteries!</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself, my sister, and my mom.</li>
    <li> It is not normal that Vietnamese people like me pay attention to the hair in the... nose. I take care of myself very carefully with my hair, my skin, with suit until one day, I saw some long hair from my nose. eww, I was quite disgusted of myself then :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product helps me a lot in dealing with hair from my nose. It save my time, it is safer than using scissors and it is more thorough. I will recommend it to anyone who really care about themselves and who want to appear elegant and have perfect appearance in daily interaction with other people.</li>
    <li> Does a great job...Very satisfied with my purchase... A perfect companion to the Norelco triple-head shaver I purchased !</li>
    <li> Everything I need is in this product!</li>
    <li> Awesome for the price. Who are these people that keep dropping this? Of course if you drop a little piece of cheap plastic it might break..stop dropping it clumsy fools.</li>
    <li> Was a gift. They love it.</li>
    <li> I used it once, it fell out of the medicine cabinet and hit the floor and has not worked again. I threw away the return papers because I never had any trouble with anything I bought on Amazon. So now I have to find another more reliable one.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Nose Trimmer lasted from June to November. Certainly not what I would have expected from a name brand product. While it functioned it worked well but five months could not reasonably be called quality.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, it is so much better than Remington&#x27;s nose and ear trimmer.  Especially I like the rotary cutter.  It&#x27;s awesome the way it cuts small hairs.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Am I the only one who gets completely disgusted by guys who never trim their ear and nose hair?  Some people look like they&#x27;re growing shrubs!  Eeeeeew!!  I had a dentist tell me once that it was one of the more disgusting aspects of her job -- sitting a customer in the chair, tilting their head back, and getting a front row seat of 2 bushy nostrils staring back at her, up close up and personal. *Blah!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby and I decided it would just be gross to share the same nose trimmer.  I mean, we love each other, but there are limits. ;oD  So we were trying to decide on the best combo of performance and cost.  I decided to go with the [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]], which is a wet/dry model and works quite well and has excellent reviews.  I&#x27;m happy with it, and it cuts like a charm.  No more furry ears!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby was considering this fancy-schmancy [[ASIN:B000FYVOJC Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]] because he thought it would be cool to have a little vacuum sucking up all the hairs as they&#x27;re trimmed.  But 20 bucks for a nose hair trimmer just seems ridiculous and excessive, even if it does vacuum!  So he decided on this Philips Norelco. it&#x27;s the perfect combo of economy and effectiveness.  Plus, we both love our [[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250X/42 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor  with Jet Clean System]], so hubby thought he&#x27;d stick with the brand. (Yes, we share a razor, but not nose trimmers -- that&#x27;s just gross -- we all draw our lines somewhere ;oD )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco nose trimmer has exactly 2 things going for it over my [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K]]: Cost and an included battery.  Other than that, they both pretty much perform equally well.  Both can be rinsed under the tap, and both cut nose and ear hair really well.  But hubby had the added bonus of not having to hunt down a battery.  Me; I had to rummage through the house for one.  But managed to find a dead alkaline to recharge in our new [[ASIN:B008467K1E Maximal Power FC999 Universal Rapid Charger for Alkaline, RAM, Ni-MH, Ni-CD, AA, AAA, C, D, N, 9V Batteries]].  (Yup, it really recharges regular alkaline batteries!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line -- this Norelco is on par with my Panasonic, but the Panasonic seems to be much more popular here on Amazon.  But we&#x27;re both quite happy with our respective nose/ear trimmers.  And they both help us from looking like scruffy bears.  Happy! ;oDnaged to find a dead alkaline to recharge in our new [[ASIN:B008467K1E Maximal Power FC999 Universal Rapid Charger for Alkaline, RAM, Ni-MH, Ni-CD, AA, AAA, C, D, N, 9V Batteries]].

    <li> Product as described.  Good results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s does the job but it takes time to do it.  I wish it could cut hair in less repetitions.  I like how safe and painless it is.</li>
    <li> I am not using this much because it doesn&#x27;t give a very close finish and also because you can&#x27;t reach all the places with its rotary blade. I am happy using my scissors again.</li>
    <li> Hate it!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Have used another brand of this for years and never any problems.  This one did not work after 10 days….even with brand new batteries replaced…..contacted Norelco direct and they are sending us a new one.  Happy with Norelco but not with this product!@!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and I like this product. It&#x27;s small, works well and it is very easy to clean. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I never owned a nose trimmer before, and always used barber scissors to cut any hairs from my nose.  Well, those days are finally gone for good.  This nose and ear trimmer removes the nose and ear hair without any cuts or pain, and its a plus that you can wash the trimmer part with running water.  I like it and I think you will also.  It sure beats a sizzor.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and works really well. Easy to clean and a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I love it, it helped me a lot in skating.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. He doesn&#x27;t cut his self anymore.</li>
    <li> A poor product that is virtually useless. Is not even remotely capable of trimming nose hair. Ended up purchasing Remington&#x27;s trimmer, which I am very happy with.</li>
    <li> Made well, easy to use, simple to clean. So far it does not pull at the hair or cause any sort of discomfort. It would be perfect if it could trim closer to the skin. But I am still satisfied with the job it does, considering the price.</li>
    <li> i am extremely pleased with my new Phillips Norelco NT8110 Nose and Ear Trimmer.  It operates simply and efficiently.  Its not a flimsy plastic toy, but the real appliance gadget.  I just love it!  I should have bought extras to &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; to friends who have everything BUT THIS!</li>
    <li> Does not work. Changed battery - still did not work - a waste of money</li>
    <li> It works, easy to use.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is nice, especially for the price. I&#x27;ve been using it once a week for a few months now and it hasn&#x27;t started yet so pull on any hairs. The switch is a bit flimsy, but who really cares? The metal ring on top gets warm-hot after a few minutes though.</li>
    <li> The size is good and the blades are sharp.  Mine seems to have contact issues, but a couple of taps against my palm and it is back up and running.</li>
    <li> This was part of a larger gift.  It seemed right at the time&lt;br /&gt;But now, my husband says that it really doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;So much for that.  I guess you should know this before you buy it.</li>
    <li> My husband hasn&#x27;t looked this good in ages!  He&#x27;s trimmed up and perfectly groomed.  And it&#x27;s very easy to use.  We are very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> :) take care of those nose hairs</li>
    <li> does the job, no pinch, no problem. think I&#x27;ll go use it right now.</li>
    <li> very comfortable and easy to use and effective</li>
    <li> Its design and small size make it a bit too prone to rolling off of a shelf and onto a hard bathroom floor. Also, it&#x27;s narrow head seems to make tasks more time consuming. But it&#x27;s well built and quiet.</li>
    <li> I tried it and it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> My nose loves this thing. Tried it for the first time at my dad&#x27;s house and ordered one immediately. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Unit works fine and is easy to clean under running water.  What else can I say, it trims the hair and does not hurt, what more can you want.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. When you turn it on it should close the head to get into the ears and nose and clip the hair it DOES NOT DO IT.</li>
    <li> I wrote this trimmer for my husband, for the treatment of nose and ears. A few weeks before working fine, but it should be noted that it is not very powerful, so I put 4 stars, well, at this price it perfectly fulfills its function. Does not irritate the skin, the hair does not pull. Overall we are happy. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It works well it is also not cheap looking and easy to handle the part you hold is a nice size i would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good product, but, unlike previous trimmers I have owned, this one clogs easily, after which it becomes temporarily useless unless you clean it with a brush.</li>
    <li> Compact , lightweight and silent, does a good job . Good value for money.</li>
    <li> This excellent nose hair trimmer has changed my life. Prior to this, I had never properly taken care of my nose hairs. I had attempted to use scissors, as well as tweezers, and had even attempted nose hair threading, but to no avail. My nose hairs grew faster and stronger than I could manage, and the pointy end of the scissors was a danger to my probiscis.&lt;br /&gt;With the purchase of this nose hair trimmer, I now trim my whiskers with ease.</li>
    <li> It works great and fast! No catching!! I like that I can rinse it off to clean it. I am definitely recommending this product.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do the job well. just does not cut the nose or ear hair...</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use. Glad I finally got one.</li>
    <li> This product did not work just after opening from the cover. Insult to the injury is the terms that you have to return this product in registered post with insurance (costing 10-15$)  in order get a refund of 9$. So you have to loose more money for the manufacturing defects. Very poor quality and customer service</li>
