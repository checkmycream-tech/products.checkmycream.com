<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this Vitamin C Serum for a few days now, and I have to say it feels great on my skin! I&#x27;ve heard of the number of skin benefits vitamin C has like lightening dark spots and sometimes even under eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days, I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my blemishes and old acne scars already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have some hyper-pigmentation areas on my skin that didn&#x27;t appear until after I turned 21. I&#x27;m excited to see the difference this serum can make on those areas because of the quick difference it made on my dark spots!</li>
    <li> Very lightweight oil that absorbs very quickly. Leaves the skin silky smooth. Has helped minimize fine lines that are starting to appear.  This product was received for the purpose of testing and review.</li>
    <li> This serum is a decent moisturizer.  Non scented and dries very quickly</li>
    <li> I was excited to recieve this product.  I am at the age where it is time to take preventative measures against aging and blemishes.  A little of this Vitamin C serum does the trick.  I love using it, it feels wonderful on my face.  It has a nice refreshing effect.  After just a few days of using this serum, I have noticed that my skin has a more radiant look.  I have less blemish problems and my skin has a more natural, healthy glow.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> It is a formulation that is new to me, but I like the way it absorbs into my skin. I can quickly apply moisturizer and / or make up with out having to wait, I am enjoying the experience, Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and have been to the dermatologist many times to try and find a solution without much luck. Vitamin C serum, in this product and few other products, have helped with my skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent a significant amount of money on lotions , moisturizers and other related products that haven&#x27;t had very effective or long lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has helped reverse sun damage to my skin that has occurred over the years. My skin is more flexible, softer, less wrinkled and less dry. Age, sun, and a harsh climate have damaged by skin over the years, but this item has worked to help rejuvenate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research on vitamin C serum prior to buying a few products that include them. I haven&#x27;t come across any undesirable side effects as a result of taking these. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serums are really popular right now and after hearing all about how amazing they are, I decided I should get my hands on them. I was excited to find them together in a serum (as opposed to a lotion because I have oily skin) and in a bottle that has an attractive label on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened it, I didn&#x27;t notice any smell. The oil dropper application is easy to use. When I first applied the serum to my face, it immediately soaked right in and felt dry within 30 seconds or so. I haven&#x27;t noticed any radical changes in my face but my skin is definitely softer and it works well as a primer for my foundation (unexpectedly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product a four instead of a five because my roommate tipped my jar over and left it sitting on its side overnight. When I found it, quite a bit of product actually leaked out through the secured cap, so make sure you keep your bottle upright!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! it arrived next day,  It&#x27;s very soothing and absorbs quickly into the skin. I wanted something to make my skin glow and this was perfect.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Smells good, very smooth.</li>
    <li> Not greasy.  Absorb fast</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. I feel thankful to use this product. I want to recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Very nice Vitamin C product. I use it under my normal moisturizer as it makes the moisturizer go on easier.</li>
    <li> Using this product for almost a month now. You can really see the effects- improved skin texture, lightens pigmentation and in my case, reduced (if not totally stop) pimples. I use to have pimples all over my face but now i&#x27;d say it has reduced to 95%. One of the best vitamin C serum i have use.</li>
    <li> It contains ingredients I need to maintain the elasticity of my skin. Very ideal for my anti-aging regimen routine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first Vitamin C Serum I have and I absolutely love it. I got a dark spot after pregnancy and this Vitamin C Serum really lightened it after few days used. Highly recommend and I look forward to the results in a few weeks time.</li>
    <li> I realy love this Vitamin C Serum,</li>
    <li> This is a great serum! I love the fact that it is organic and it does not have harsh chemicals or ingredients in it. I am a master aesthetician so I am pretty picky with my facial skincare; this serum does not break me out (I have oily and acne prone skin) and it does its purpose. I put it on all night before I go to bed and in the morning my face feels &#x27;tightened&#x27; and the appearance of my pores are dramatically reduced; remember, it is best to put on serums at night so the product will penetrate in your skin. I give this a five star because it works and the more vitamin c the better.</li>
    <li> Just use 2 nights, I found out this Vitamin C Serum by Elite Labs work nice and it hydrate my skin effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t feel dry and help my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I can&#x27;t testify scientifically, but I had a little cluster of basal cells on my forehead that my doctor said I should get removed. I used this product daily for a month or so and before I could get to my dermatologist, the cluster actually fell off. I can state for certain that this product brightened my complexion and gave me that certain glow that looks healthy and vibrant.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! It is very comfortable on the skin and makes the skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had much time yet to notice a lot, but so far I have not adverse effects....so far so good</li>
    <li> The best quality products</li>
    <li> I got a great deal on this serum, so I decided to try it in place of the one I had been using before. Since it was basically the same kind of serum as the other brand, I didn&#x27;t notice any changes. Which is a good thing since adding a vitamin c serum to my routine has done wonders for my skin. The only draw back for me is that I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of this product. You may not think that should matter, but you are putting it on your face, so if you are sensitive to scents it&#x27;s literally in your face, so to speak. However, if I hadn&#x27;t used a different brand that smelt better, I don&#x27;t think I would have noticed the smell of this product as much. And it&#x27;s not a lingering or foul smell, so it&#x27;s not going to stop me from continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> This cosmetics, have excellent anti-aging. I think that it&#x27;s just come back to the skin of the girl in a clean and paint a few days. With me Let&#x27;s feel this fun.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is such magical stuff, and this is a wonderful product!  It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and I definitely see a difference in the quality of my skin.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice consistency and I&#x27;ve been using for about a week. I have oily skin and was afraid it would just add to the oil but it doesn&#x27;t. Actually think it has cut down on the oiliness a bit!</li>
    <li> I have pretty oily skin and a few slight lines due to sun and age so I was doubtful of this serum making an noticeable impact, but WOW. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my skin tone and &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; since I&#x27;ve began using this, it&#x27;s unbelievable. I apply at night after washing my face before bed and also in the morning after washing my face before I apply my makeup. People think I&#x27;m wearing foundation when I&#x27;m not. And the most surprising to me is that my oily skin seems to be neutralizing and it&#x27;s not nearly as oily. I don&#x27;t know the science behind why this works so well, but I do know it works.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my friend, after she used it for 1 month, and she told me she feel her skin just like 18 again, that really impressive. I&#x27;ll keep follow what will change with her.</li>
    <li> Does see much different on me.</li>
    <li> I just want to give HUGE kuddos to the company for providing me with a free shipment of Elite Labs Vitamin C Serum for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pushing 30 and noticing fine lines, sun damage, and all the other effects of aging. Well, I heard about Elite Labs and thought I&#x27;d take the opportunity to try their product. Well I must say that I made a really great choice. I love that this anti-aging serum is full of Vitamin C and Vitamin E. I truly am excited to see the results from using this product long term. I can already feel the difference in my skin. My face and neck feel so soft and smooth. I didn&#x27;t notice any overwhelming scent or odor from the serum. Also, my skin is highly sensitive and acne prone. Elite Labs Vitamin C Serum did NOT make me break out! Instead, I notice the existing acne I had slowly diminishing. I noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin as I applied it after washing my face. I noticed my skin looked brighter and more radiant. The serum was not sticky or too thick. It wasn&#x27;t super watery like other products. I felt it was perfect consistency for my skin. I noticed that it was quick absorbing, therefore I didn&#x27;t have to wait long before applying my makeup in the morning. I love this product and can&#x27;t wait to try their upcoming eye serum ;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use Vitamin C Serum, and it really works on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It soften my skin, and one dark spot I care the most has fade in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Some wrinkles has been smooth away.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a month, skin feels tighter and does not show signs of irritation.  I love how it gets absorbed quickly and does not feel greasy when applying on skin.</li>
    <li> work nice and it hydrate my skin effectively&lt;br /&gt;Just use 2 nights, I found out this Vitamin C Serum by Elite Labs work nice and it hydrate my skin effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t feel dry and help my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Feels good, because of short period time, did not see any change yet</li>
    <li> I have oily but sensitive skin, so I am very careful on everything applying on my face. It&#x27;s hard to find a good vitamin C serum for me, since my skin is sensitive to it, but I would like to give this product a try. The serum arrived on time and in good condition. On the first day, I put on the serum at night after shower. In the morning, I found some slight redness on my cheeks. I knew I have sensitive skin, so I was not surprise about it. I stopped applying the serum for one day and then tried it again. It turned out good! My skin got used to it gradually; I don&#x27;t have redness or rash on my face. I would recommend it to people with skin type like me.</li>
    <li> First time trying Vitamin C serum on my face and feel the difference after the first couple days. My skins are softer and I would recommend tries organic product.</li>
    <li> The skin becomes moist feel so good&lt;br /&gt; Continue to be used to make a product and want.&lt;br /&gt; I would like to use for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you.</li>
    <li> Elite Labs Organic Vitamin C Serum is a treat for your skin! Containing 20 %Hyaluronic acid base, this serum brightens the skin, evens out the skin tone, reduces lines and wrinkles and best of all, its anti-aging. The product comes in a 1 oz size which is a nice size considering you only need a few drops in your morning and evening regimen. I have noticed the difference in my skins texture and tone within the past 2 weeks since receiving this serum. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent Vitamin C Serum by Elite Labs.  I use at night time by itself and my skin looks smooth and moisturized when I get up in the morning. It is a lightweight serum and you only need a small amount for desired result.  No more dry spots on my face.  I also use it under my regular facial moisturizer. My skin looks more healthy, bright and radiant since using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It is of the right consistency and doesn&#x27;t feel very oily or runny on my face. I love that it is manufactured in the USA and that its made with organic and natural ingredients. However, it may be due to this fact that this product doesn&#x27;t smell so great. It may be a plus for some because I know I can manage the smell if that means I wasn&#x27;t putting unnecessary toxins onto my face. The smell can be easily masked since after I let it absorb, I immediately apply my moisturizer which offsets the smell. I found this to be extremely moisturizing for my face and after daily use every morning and night,, I find myself to have a brightened appearance and a natural glow. I really love this product and highly recommend it. A minor problem I had with this problem was in the packaging. I had such a tough time removing the plastic that was attached to the bottle, there were no dotted lines to easily peel it off and the plastic was so tight, so I had to get a small knife to remove the plastic which might have scratched the bottle cap. Other than that, the quality of this product is superior!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week. I have noticed some amazing results. My fine lines and frowns are a lot less noticeable. I&#x27;ve been told that my skin is glowing. I have been recommending this product to anyone that asks me what I have been doing differently.</li>
    <li> wonderful deal! love vitamin c skincare products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle now and honestly, I can&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This is really a nice product and will purchase again when I run out.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and I generally apply it under my normal moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This serum does not have noticeable odor, which is a plus if you are sensitive to scents. I prefer my products to be scent-free if possible. The serum is easily absorbed and does not leave an oily feeling afterwards. It makes my skin feel quite moisturized in fact. But I still follow with a moisturizer as I believe you should try to help your skin out as much as possible. I do not have visible lines or wrinkles on my face so I cannot comment on how well it reduces wrinkles. I use this as part of my prevention routine on my face, neck, and chest. Most damage and aging start way before they are visible hence the need for prevention now! My skin does have a nice glow though I am an night owl.</li>
    <li> Very good serum.I use it under moisturizer and it is not coming off like most vitamin C creams. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Skin broke out after use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply wonderful, I would recommend it to anyone. It even helped me with acne. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help erase some of the stress and aging lines in my face.  It did not irritate my face like some serums can, but it did not do anything for me either.  I have chronic dry sensitive skin, do this was worth a try.</li>
    <li> As a woman in my early 30&#x27;s, skincare has become an increasingly important part of my life. Wrinkles and fine lines are starting to crop up on my face and I can definitely see a difference in the way I look now as opposed to just a few years ago. I really enjoy natural and organic products, so I was excited to give this serum a try. I really like it! In just a few weeks, I can see a noticeable difference in the overall look of my skin. I also like how this serum makes my face feel. I would definitely recommend it for women looking for anti-aging solutions. *Product provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 days and can already see an improvement in the overall condition of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;At 61 yrs of age I was finally noticing the lines and wrinkles starting to appear, so when I was offered the opportunity to receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review I accepted Elite Lab&#x27;s offer.&lt;br /&gt;I had heard about the benefits of Organic Vitamin C Serum on a talk show, but quite honestly I was apprehensive that using it would produce the results I desired.&lt;br /&gt;After only 5 days I can see a slight diminishing of the smaller lines around my lips and eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the dropper to apply a few drops to my entire face before bedtime and my skin tone looks more even and my skin feels fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more my skin improves after using this Vitamin C Serum for a month and will do my best to remember to come back and update this review.&lt;br /&gt;In the meanwhile I can honestly say that this product seems to be everything it is advertised to be.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for allowing me to give it a try in exchange for my unbiased review, Elite Labs.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and your excellent customer follow up make it easier to honestly give your product a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for use as part of my regular skin care routine.  It really feels soft going on and is immediately absorbed by my skin with no oily feeling.  I noticed an immediate tightening of my skin and then after a while my skin felt more moisturized.  I  didn&#x27;t really need anything else after I used the serum.  The bottle should last a long time since you only need a couple drops.</li>
    <li> I noticed that my face  feel extra soft - I think without even realizing it, I ended up moisturizing my face and cuticles! I will definitely do this on purpose in the future - awesome to have a product on face that can keep my face happy</li>
    <li> Great serum that absorbed fast!</li>
    <li> It is light weight and fast absorbing, no weird fragrance scent which I liked, but I started to get some breakouts on my forehead, I will take a week of break to see if this serum was the cause then decide if I wanna keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once, but when I pop any blemishes or remove blackheads, my skin swells up where I pinched. Usually, it goes away overnight when I sleep or within an hour if I use these green tea wipes. I put this on right after I squeezed the heck out of blemishes all over my face and neck and had to go to dinner. Swollen little welpy bumps before dinner is NOT cute. I was hesitant to put it on before leaving the house since I do have sensitive skin, but I figured with the vitamins in it, it couldn&#x27;t hurt too much since my face was already red and bumpy. Within 5 minutes, it was WAY less red and much smoother. Within 10 minutes, it was as if I had never messed with my face. I like it so far.</li>
    <li> It is good for sensitive skin like me. I&#x27;ve used it on my entire face for about two weeks, it&#x27;s great so far and feeling no more dry in the winter after using it. I think it does a great job on hydrating my skin. Worth giving it a try!</li>
    <li> This is better than I expected</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing.  I have sensitive skin, and also combination skin, meaning areas of my face are a little dry, while others are oily. This takes the redness away and really calms down my skin. Instead of combination skin, this makes my skin appear youthful with a natural glow - it is not oily, and it absorbs right into the skin.  I can even skip foundation if I want to because my skin is so calm!  Buying some for my sister for her Birthday! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This VC serum really works. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Nothing feels better on your skin. It&#x27;s like a little bottle of sun.</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if it could minimalize the crows feet forming on my eyes.  After only using for a few days, the lines seem a little softer.  There has been no strong odor nor irritant in the serum for me.  I&#x27;m only rating product as a 4 star since I&#x27;ve used it for such a short time.</li>
    <li> It make my face very soft .It&#x27;s easy to absorb and not greasy !</li>
    <li> Still to early to tell if it is working</li>
    <li> I have not tried other brands of vitamin C serum so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this too, but it has worked well for me. It&#x27;s not an oil or a lotion and it does not seem to moisturize on it&#x27;s own. Once it dries, I apply my usual moisturizer over it. My skin has appeared smoother, brighter, and with improved texture.</li>
    <li> I apply it every night before bed for a week now and now i can feel the dark spots is faded a little by little. I will definitely continuously using it for sure.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work as well as apple stem cell products. Smells like orange but didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
    <li> I really like&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on the skin and is absorbed&lt;br /&gt;Satisfactory</li>
    <li> got this for a review and have been using it daily and it has really helped my skin and gave it a better complexion</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful things!!! Awesome!!</li>
    <li> This is a great serum for the face! I love the smell and it smooths onto my skin easily and evenly. i have already noticed a difference in my fine lines, they are not as prominent as they were before I started using it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful unit. Better than I expected</li>
    <li> This is very good!! I think it is reasonable price~~</li>
    <li> Love the product and the result.  I would like to try their other product line as well.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I had been using another similar product from another company that had been discontinued and found this on Amazon. After reading the reviews, ordered it, and have been using it since. The company co-founder has been in contact with me about my experience with the Serum, and think that is impressive as well. The result are not dramatic, but my skin does look and feel better. I will be purchasing this again and again!</li>
    <li> Elite Labs Vitamin C Serum works very well.  I noticed a big difference within a week of using.  Also, the first time I used the product, I noticed the lines around my eyes were softened.  I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Like any good husband I try to pamper my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive as that can be sometimes I really enjoy keeping her happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women are super big on their looks and they just want to feel attractive and remain looking their youngest. Even if they don&#x27;t admit it. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just watch how long it takes them to get ready to head out to the grocery store. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought my wife this organic vitamin c serum for face as a surprise because of all the positive reviews I read online about vitamin c facial serum from a trusted doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I love eating organic foods and so I wanted to find the best organic skin care serum available on Amazon which after doing a lot of searching and research I finally found this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her package arrived I waited for my wife to get home and then I surprised her with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She absolutely LOVES this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could hear my wife telling her mom on the phone about how great this stuff made her face feel and that she needed to buy some for herself and I came in the room and she was just grinning from ear to ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I waited until later that night and went in to our bedroom and washed my face and then tried some of her vitamin c serum myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just got done putting it on my face when my wife walks in and scared me...haha...we just started laughing but actually this stuff was pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled nice and felt good on my skin. I was expecting it to be over powering or heavy on my skin but it actually felt really good and brightened up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say she is VERY happy with this vitamin c serum and if she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Elite Labs Organic Vitamin C Serum for Face to anyone!</li>
    <li> THREE MONTH UPDATE:    Okay... maybe I haven&#x27;t updated this as much as I wanted, but I just received my 3rd bottle of this stuff and had to provide an update. The short is this product WORKS! I think when it comes to skincare... you really need to invest in time in using the product. Firstly, this serum is a godsend for anyone living in cold climates... it&#x27;s almost like an insulator for the cold winds. My skin is never dry and consistently hydrated. While they never mentioned it.. I have noticed that some of my sunspots have faded - that&#x27;s pretty damn cool.     But for me the real kicker is the reversal of aging. I tend to frown a lot and this product has definitely reduced my forehead creases.     NOTE: I have been using this product almost religiously! So if you want results from this product... you have to use it consistently and just give it time to work. No skincare product works overnight.... but if you&#x27;re after real and measurable results from a vitamin c serum... than this is the product for you.      TWO WEEK UPDATE:  I have been using this Vitamin C serum, following the instructions to the tea, and I going to report the results. Living in New York City and with winter practically here means I need a very effective hydration solution to product my skin in the chilly winds. Well I can say after years of living in Manhattan that I have finally find my savior! This product definitely helps guard your skin from the dryness in the winter months... so does it hydrate your skin effectively.... ABSOLUTELY!    In terms of anti-aging strength - well while it hasn&#x27;t removed my forehead wrinkles, I have seen a reduction. But, I&#x27;ve only been using the product for 2 weeks.    Looking forward to more results and I will post back here in another 2 weeks. This may form part of the ultimate skin care regimen.    ORIGINAL REVIEW:  So I would consider myself a pretty experienced skin care user. I was seeking out a product that both hydrates and perfects the skin, as well as aproduct that combats signs of aging. After much analysis and deliberation of all the products online, I decided to give this Vitamin C Serum a go.    I ordered this product last week and it arrived on Sunday and I have been religiously following the instructions, which is to apply the vitamin c serum daily. Well... Elite Labs, I&#x27;m impressed. The serum itself has a very mild and pure scent, so it&#x27;s not overpowering and not water-weak either. In terms of the consistency of the serum, it is not watery and not thick - it has the perfect consistency to apply to your face and gently massage in.    What really blew me away is the actual product, after a few hours of putting this product on, I can literally say my skin is much more hydrated and toned, like I can actually feel - and more important - SEE the difference. With winter coming this is something I definitely want to have, a hydrated and toned complexion.    So Elite Labs - I would say that I am very happy with this product and would go as far as saying that it is the best Vitamin C serum for face I have tried. I will continue to use this product daily and report back how the anti-aging side of things come along.</li>
    <li> This vitamin c serum has been great so far. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days and I know it takes a month or so of consistent use before you can start really seeing the benefits. I&#x27;m excited to see some results with my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review after using it for a month or two.</li>
    <li> My wife heard about this vitamin c serum from a friend who recommended that she try this instead of the anti-aging products she has been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using beauty products for years.  She has spent a lot of time researching skin care products and reviews before she settled on one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this organic vitamin c serum for face she says she’ll never buy any other product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is very impressed with the facial serum so far and says there is already a noticeable softening of wrinkles on her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not a strong scent or smell with this topical vitamin c like most you find which is a big plus for her because she can’t stand strong smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is super excited about her results and recommends this product to everyone now!</li>
    <li> The serum is thick in consistency. It did add glow to my skin! I love vitamin c serums. This one does the job pretty well. I would recommend this to others! Do give it a try. After some research, I found that 20% vitamin c is the best to have and this serum has it! Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Perfect serum and works on me very well. I will buy more and give to friends and family in the future!!</li>
    <li> I just have to say that I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now (day and night) and I definitely see and feel the difference. I will definitely be buying more... I love it!</li>
    <li> It was nice and gental, I feel fresh after using it.</li>
    <li> I  think this product is a great buy for the money.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use a lot. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It completely absorbs into my skin without leaving my face feeling greasy.  It has a smooth and silky texture and a pleasant fragrance.  It makes my skin feels smooth while lessening the appearance of the lines in my forehead.  I also notice that my skin appeared a little brighter and even toned.</li>
    <li> Love this vitamin C serum! I have noticed my dark spots lightening since I&#x27;ve started using this twice daily. I will be buying more for sure!</li>
    <li> it smells a bit sweet, absorb fast. Have no idea yet how effect could be to improve the skin, but there is no any bad reaction too.</li>
    <li> Product is as described and skin feels good after using it. Recommended!!</li>
    <li> non  greasy formula that glides right on and goes in your skin really quick.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, no smell and the skin can absorb the Serum really quick and make my dryness went away right away.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum for many reasons. First,it is organic,so I know it is safe to use on my skin. Second, it is the perfect anti aging concoction for healthy skin and best results ,because it has 20%vitamin c, vitamin e and hyaluronic acid. I have only been using it for a few days now,so it might be too soon to give a full review, but I had to honestly say that I&#x27;m already really liking it,because I noticed that my skin is already starting to look brighter and glowing due to the vitamin c,and I noticed that my skin looks a bit more plump,less dry and just healthy overall due to the hyaluronic acid and vitamin e. I can only imagine what it will do in a couple months.  So far so great. I will be updating my review after using it longer. Also it was shipped on time and packaged wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Smooth very soon in to skin!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this serum.  I also like the fact that it is made in the USA.</li>
    <li> just start using this for less than a week. Haven&#x27;t seen any drastic change yet but my skin does feel a bit smoother than before</li>
    <li> This vitamin c Serum hydrates my skin during the cold winter days I have been using it for a while now  and my skin is looking great and smooth and supple the brown spots on my face is disappearing and it looks firmer i like that it is formulated with natural organic ingredients because the ingredients are organic i didn&#x27;t expect it to work  I am surprised  with the results very impressive.</li>
    <li> I also bought it because I thought the vendor put alot of effort into the design of the package which for me is always a must because it tells me they care about their product well enough to make it at least presentable, especially since I consider this a beauty product.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell and texture. Goes on smooth and keeps my skin feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> Good product, goes on nicely.  Good packaging, instructions, etc.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how it works!  Company even followed up to see how it is working!</li>
    <li> This serum goes on quickly and absorbs evenly. I&#x27;ve seen a marked decrease in the fine lines that have developed on my forehead and eyes. Hopefully it keeps them from getting any worse for quite a while!</li>
    <li> seems to lighten my skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week and my skin feels smoother,  and spots seem to be diminishing.  Will continue use for greater results.</li>
    <li> Nice product, would love to buy another one after the first bottle that I am using now. Not feeling sticky nor having unpleasant smells. Skin feels soft and hydrated.  Would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I like the product and it works! My skin becomes better within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> It moisturize and works nicely.</li>
    <li> works wonders. thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using  this product  almost  daily for a couple  of weeks.  I should  start by mentioning  I have pretty  good skin  without  needing  much. If anything  its slightly  dry but no acne and no major discoloration (except  darker under eye circles) so I don&#x27;t notice  any major  differences  using  this serum. I think  for me this is probably  something  to use now to keep my skin healthy and young in the long run. I like that it&#x27;s organic and a tiny drop goes a long way so I know  the bottle  will last. I have not yet decided  if it will stay a part of my skin care regiment yet.</li>
    <li> This serum has made a big difference in my skin&#x27;s clarity. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but after a few weeks, I noticed my face looks brighter and my scars have faded. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> best moisturizing serum</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my dry skin..</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It makes me look brighter and health skin. My skin feel better and it seems to smooth out wrinkles as well!</li>
    <li> I waited until I used it for about three weeks before giving a review. Overall, I think this is a great serum, it keeps my skin moisturized and the consistency is very easy to lather onto the face and neck. I do notice that after daily use in the morning and at night, I wake up to a more brightened look. However, the smell of this serum is not very pleasing to my nose, I cannot stand this smell which is why after I put it on and wait a few minutes, I immediately put on some moisturizer to cover up the nasty smell. Also, after I put it on, I noticed that my skin seems like its very tight so I recommend putting on some moisturizer after you use this serum.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find it to work for me as the fist bottle of vitamin C I ordered - not as strong</li>
    <li> Love this face serum, goes on smoothly, really makes my face feel fresh and shine.  It does not have an overpowering smell and was not harsh on my face but gave it a freshly cleaned look.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Def saw a difference. Nothing hige but enough to see that my dkin does seem brighter &amp; a tad smoother.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple different vitamin c serums to correct some dark spots and blemish scars.  The ones that I used in the past were really runny and I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in the appearance of my skin.  I noticed a difference right away with this serum and that is the fact that it isn&#x27;t runny and when I apply it to my skin I can actually feel it working, its almost a sting but not in an unpleasant or painful way.  More of a tingle.  After using it for a week my skin looks great, its smoother and brighter and my scars and dark spots have noticeably faded.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Love this serum. My face never feel so soft until I used this product. It also give you that morning glow when you put it on too. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Love this Serum; absorbs fast and makes my skin soft and smoother. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried few days and I can see some improvement</li>
    <li> Have been using this for 3 days, so I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. A lil goes a long way and it does dry pretty fast so you don&#x27;t have  to wait to finish your skin regimen.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about one week and love the feel of my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a for a few days and I&#x27;m really loving how bright my skin is looking and how smooth it&#x27;s feeling</li>
    <li> I am 44 years old. I have a few fine lines and wrinkles. I have been looking for a product to help eliminate them. I have been using this product for over a week. My skin has never felt or looked better. My friends have even noticed a change in my skin. I love this product. Give it a try and I know you will love it too.</li>
    <li> Great product and we got it at a special price. My wife loves it as it helps keep her skin looking young and hydrated!  Item came in quick and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving your product..it&#x27;s simple to apply and I love that there&#x27;s not a noticeable smell.it&#x27;s giving me soft smooth and a glow.I have significant sun damage and I&#x27;m always looking for something to minimize my fine lines and wrinkles. I will continue with this product!</li>
    <li> My skin can absorb it quickly. Feel very light after applying. highly recommend for summer using.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It is a 5 star product. Vitamin C Serum reduced fine lines and wrinkles within a week. It goes on smooth and it soaks in really fast. I really like it and I would recommend it to all of my friends. I received this product in exchange for my review. I would have reviewed it anyways because it is so great! A little goes a long ways. Week two: I still like this serum. I see small changes and I still recommend this product. I have sensitive skin and it works fine for me. It dries really fast so you can apply your moisturizer within a minute.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product!!! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin irritate, a problem that I had with other products. The consistency of this serum is perfectly fit for the serum to absorb in my skin quickly. I use this product to eliminate my acne scars and dark spots. After a few week I realize my skin is actually brighter and more energy.</li>
    <li> I like it. it quickly go into your skin and i like the smell, you can tell it is from fresh lemon.</li>
