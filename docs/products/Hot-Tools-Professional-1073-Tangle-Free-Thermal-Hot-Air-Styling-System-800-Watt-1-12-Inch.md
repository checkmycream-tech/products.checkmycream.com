      <li>I do  a much better job but still not as good as her.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
      <li>I thought it said it would rotate, does not do this on its own though.  </li>
      <li>The brush grabs the ends of my hair and makes a nice relaxed curl.  </li>
      <li>This has great air volume but it gets very hot.  </li>
      <li>When styling your hair you can easily burn your fingers and it stopped working after I used it for about a week!</li>
      <li>so was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price!  </li>
      <li>I love the ease of use and the wonderful results on my fine straight hair.  </li>
      <li>Hot air brushes combine the two, and this was a great option.</li>
      <li>and I can hold the hair against the hot tool and get great results.</li>
      <li>but it did not leave my hair very smooth.</li>

      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>and I love that.</li>
      <li>(made a popping sound and started burning all the bristles off!)</li>
      <li>My hair never looked better.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s also a release button that allows the barrel to spin freely unrolling the hair you had on it kind of automatically.  </li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work much better on thinner hair.</li>
      <li>so I would have better control over using a bulky hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>I love the heat that it puts out, but have noticed that it tends to burn the hair if you happen to get any inside of the holes.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>but I am actually able to use this tool no problem and within 5 minutes I have a salon look.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought this tool.</li>
      <li>My wife can&#x27;t love this anymore.  </li>
      <li>I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> But worried it will burn out.  Sadly not many options out there with enough air flow.  This has great air volume but it gets very hot.  So worried it will burn out pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE on FEB. 28, 2014:  Sadly the motor in this is already dying.  It is making a bad sound and stopping alot.  I am now shopping for a new option.</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  It should be used on damp hair not wet.  You have to use a hair dryer first.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is too thick and straight to see much of a curl in the ends.  I have to use lots of hairspray,  which I don&#x27;t like to do.  That defeats the purpose of washing my hair.  The hot tool does make my hair less frizzy.  My hair looks smoother after using it.  When I purchased this hot tool I was under the impression that the barrel rotated automatically.  It does not.  I have to physically turn it myself and lock in in place.  This makes my hands tired.  The easy release tangle free feature does work well though.  Maybe a more expensive model from another brand that automatically rotates would work better for me though.  Or I can just use my curling iron instead with hairspray.</li>
    <li> Total junk-DO NOT BUY!  First one I bought was defective, so I ordered a replacement. this one was defective also. It had a rattling sound when motor/fan was on. Today It nearly exploded-started smoking and inside it was RED HOT. The thing could have caught my hair on fire.There are SERIOUS quality/safely issues here. STAY AWAY from this product. Buy the John F***a air brush instead.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these from my salon a few years ago. It finally broke and I looked in every store I could think of. No one had one--of this brand or any other brand. The great thing about this is the round brush/hair dryer all in one feature. No need to use a dryer and separate round brush requiring three hands to do your hair!  There&#x27;s also a release button that allows the barrel to spin freely unrolling the hair you had on it kind of automatically.  I paid over twice this much at the salon so was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price!  It&#x27;s exactly like the one I had.  Seriously thinking about ordering another as a spare.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly, frizzy hair and need the extra heat against the metal barrell to straighten and smooth my hair. This tool is great. The only problem is that I wish the plastic tip covered a larger area because I sometimes burn the tips of my fingers when I am holding that end and turning the brush with the other hand.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this hot air styling system, and I&#x27;m sad to say it&#x27;s a bit of a letdown.  It&#x27;s the bristles.  The bristles are the nylon type, meant to be more like natural bristles than the rigid or pin-type bristles.  I understand that this would be AWESOME for others, but I have really long, thick coarsish hair that really needs the more rigid bristles.  I bought this to save me a little step and not be so dependent on the hair dryer + rigid-bristle brush combo to get my hair dry and smooth, but it really makes more work for me.</li>
    <li> I received this item as a gift, and was hoping for an awesome product per all of the reviews I had seen. I love the heat that it puts out, but have noticed that it tends to burn the hair if you happen to get any inside of the holes. I was hoping that the bristles would have been a bit stronger (more stiff), but I am comparing to a different one that I have used in the past. It seems to work much better on thinner hair.</li>
    <li> This is my second hot tool, the first one lost it&#x27;s heat after just under a year, but I found out later, after ordering another one, that if I had cleaned the filter, it probably would have been restored.  Anyway, I have very unruly curly hair, and with this hot tool 1 1/2\\&quot; brush, I can actually have a smooth straight hairdo that lasts between washings.  LOVE IT.  jb</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. I thought it said it would rotate, does not do this on its own though.  You have to hold a button down and that&#x27;s difficult to do while working with hair.  It also gets very hot, so hot that hot gloves are necessary to use the styler if it takes you awhile to do your hair.</li>
    <li> I just love this product....works great for the price...and the last one I bought lasted 9 years, I say that&#x27;s pretty good....worth buying one if you need it.....as I did....</li>
    <li> This Hot Air brush is one of the first that I have bought that had enough heat to help with styling.  It does not blow your hair all over like some of the higher wattage styling brushes.  The one bad thing is the tip is so short that you don&#x27;t have much to work with and can easily burn your fingers once the brush is heated up.  Would be eaiser to work with if the tip end was longer.</li>
    <li> not a good very dissatified with this itme i returned for full refund</li>
    <li> I really do like this little hair styling tool and have three -- one for home, one for travel, and one spare. Using it, I can dry my hair, and by the time I&#x27;m finished, so is my hair.  My hair is turned under and fluffy, and all I have to do is brush it into place and spray a little. I don&#x27;t have to use a separate curling tool.  I also like its weight and fit in my hand.  Some others I&#x27;ve tried were too big around and too heavy.  It takes a little practice to use it, but very little.  I wash my hair, dry it with a towel, put the hair products I use in it, comb it back, and it&#x27;s about right to dry/brush after I&#x27;ve got my makeup on.  You don&#x27;t want your hair dripping wet, but you do want it damp.  The next day, I just spray some water on my hair and use the air brush again.</li>
    <li> I use this Hot Air Styler daily and just love it. Makes your hair so much smoother. I use this and then curl or straighten my hair and the results are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipment thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Great hair tool, the price was even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brenda</li>
    <li> Do not buy! I&#x27;ve used this dryer once weekly for almost a year just to dry my bangs. On Christmas Eve it made a funny noise. The dryer went out and the plastic handle on the brush got so hot I thought it was going to catch on fire. My house smelled like burning plastic. I take good care of my things and it still looks like it did the day I took it out of the box. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think this dryer was built to last and had I left it on I fear it would have caught on fire!</li>
    <li> The brush bristles are very short therefore does not hold the hair as you try to blow dry. Heat is acceptable but gets hot at the tip so you have to be very careful are you will get burned.</li>
    <li> This curling brush works great for my hair but I tend to wear one out every year or so. It was difficult/impossible to find a replacement in retail stores. Thanks for solving this problem for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Hot Tools 1073, Hot Air Styling System, 800 Watt.  I used it less then a minute and it was in motion during that time.  I could smell my hair burning.  I turned it off, waited a few minutes and I decreased the switch from high to low.  Once again I could smell my hair burning. I&#x27;m assuming the product is defective.  The Amazon 30 day return policy has just lapsed: win some, loose some.  I also bought a Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron and it is great.</li>
    <li> I love it! Works wonders on my hair and I always get compliments of how I curl the ends. Also its easy to use and I take with me with I travel. I truly love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was a HUGE disappointment. When styling your hair you can easily burn your fingers and it stopped working after I used it for about a week! I returned it to Amazon!</li>
    <li> This was priced right and works just as expected.  I have straight fine, thin hair, so this gives my hair lasting volume very quickly and easily.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> So I came across this product when I was looking for a new curling iron. I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. I have to say I thought it was just a brush that heats at the core but it&#x27;s a mini blow dryer that heats up the brush. Now it does get very hot so you must be careful but I loved the results. I have full long hair so I like to do different styles. I try not to use a hot iron too often but I feel like something like this I can use everyday. It is not as loud as a blow dryer but it&#x27;s not something you wanna use with someone sleeping in the room. This tool has 2 settings (high and low) and will work on any hair. I&#x27;m very happy I purchased this hot air brush.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. The release feature is not that good compared to another old hot air styling brush I had. It is kind of loud but not too bad that you can&#x27;t stand it. It doe its job.</li>
    <li> This dryer does exactly what it says. It&#x27;s definitely hot so be careful. Overall I love it.</li>
    <li> Loved them. Hello all..</li>
    <li> From the description of the air brush, I thought it rotated as it dried; realize now that it only has a &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; button to free hair if it is caught in brush.  Like having a high and low choice.  Bristles are a little short to really grab hair.  I have had good luck with Hot Tools products in the past.  Will use this air brush but it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser, Colin Booker, used this hair dryer on me and I fell in love with it. It&#x27;s my second one, since first one got blown out in European hotel. Not the fault of the hairdryer, rather a faulty adapter. But just the fact that I actually packed it shows I can&#x27;t do without it.  It adds body and wave to my stick straight hair. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This styling brush works very well. I like it very much. 4 stars because on the high setting, it does get very hot.</li>
    <li> I have bought this curler several times over the passed 10 years.  That speaks for itself!!  I have had other brands that I ended up not using and just threw away.</li>
    <li> does not rotate, difficult to use.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the drying power of my previous one--Helen of Troy.  800 watts versus 1000.  It works and may be less damaging to my hair.</li>
    <li> Over dries hair. Be prepared to have brittle hair if you use daily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product at all. It&#x27;s engineered poorly unless you can style one-handed. The tip of the brush that protects your hand is way too short so unless you like styling with a silicone glove, you&#x27;re going to burn your left fingers. It was relegated to my gym bag within a week, and is probably going to a thrift store shortly. It&#x27;s just unusable for this user.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes these but they only last about a year before they die.  I know they&#x27;re not expensive but think they should still last longer.  We always keep a new one on hand so she won&#x27;t be without when the one she&#x27;s using dies.</li>
    <li> This is probably my 5th or 6th one  of these. I have thick very curly hair and this tool allows me to get it smooth and soft without  straightening.  The only complaint I have  is that I have to replace it  about every 12 to 18 months,  but I use it every day!  Love!</li>
    <li> It has great power, and as it says is truly tangle-free.  Would buy again!  Fast and easy!  Great gift for family or friend.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air dryer. It is the perfect tool for drying and curling at the same time. It&#x27;s like salon results at home! The only complaint I have is that it takes forever to dry hair. I have to dry it out mostly with a regular hair dryer first and then use the hot air brush to finish drying and curl. It is really hot so be careful!</li>
    <li> Terrible quality product! When plugged in, made funny noises with electrical sparks (like fireworks) coming out of the center of the tool. Then the smell of burnt plastic from the inside brush! Was afraid to use it in the case I might get electrocuted! Never had a hair brush like this before!</li>
    <li> When I use this tool I am always asked &amp;#34;who does your Hair&amp;#34;.....My answer is always &amp;#34;Me&amp;#34;!!! I Love Hot Tools Products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this item a few times before and it&#x27;s always had a different problem. One burned out, one didn&#x27;t seem to have as much power as the first. Most recently this one gets too hot. There&#x27;s no temperature control, just high and low power and the high setting is needed if you&#x27;re curling damp hair. There needs to be a cold shot button to set the curl before it&#x27;s released and a high and low temp setting for people with fragile colored hair. Otherwise, this is the only curling brush I have found that has a curl release button and I find that it&#x27;s an invaluable feature so that the curl you just created isn&#x27;t pulled out as you remove the hair. It could also have more bristles so that fine hair doesn&#x27;t show roller marks.</li>
    <li> The hair styling system broke after about seven uses.  It seemed to overheat and so I shut it off.  It never would turn on again and yes, I did check my surge protector and fuse box. Needless to say, it was a waste of money .  Unfortunately, I threw out the shipping box and receipt.</li>
    <li> Good item as I have used this branch and type for a number of years.  I like this product very much.</li>
    <li> Bristles too soft to actually style thick hair.</li>
    <li> I can wash my thick hair in the morning before work and dry and style it in 10 minutes.  Bouncy, healthy hair and no worries about harming my hair.  This is the best hair appliance I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  It&#x27;s my third on .  I can&#x27;t live without this product  my daughter also has one and loves it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a month now and so far so good.  It&#x27;s a lot easier than using a round brush with a blow dryer. You do have to be careful  however because the barrell does get pretty hot.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Recommended by my daughter who teaches at a salon academy. Good value for the money. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Perfect solution to a big awkward hair dryer.  My old one burned out in Europe even though I had the adaptor, and I found I could not live without a new one!</li>
    <li> Hair dries quickly leaving smooth locks of hair unlike conventional hair dryer.  There is a quick release button so long hair does not get caught.  I love my new dryer.</li>
    <li> Well, at least I can say I finally found a curling hot air tool that does put out a lot of heat.  In fact, so much heat, that I only use this tool on low setting never high as it would surely burn my hair.  Previously I replaced my old conair hot air curling brush and the old one was great, but the new one, well, I could spit hotter than it got. I sent that one back.  Bought another in the store with a little smaller barrel, because that is all they had, still not worth 10 cents.  Now this one works.  BUT, the annoying thing about this one as opposed to the conair hot air styling iron/brush, is that it has very short (only a little longer than 1/4&amp;#34; soft bristles) to hold your hair.  The conair had plastic rigid teeth about 1/2&amp;#34; long that really held your hair as you ran it through the hair to curl the ends.  I really miss that.  As a result, it takes longer to curl the ends of my hair with the hot tools 1073, because I have to keep running the brush through the ends of the hair and curling it around the brush over and over to get the same result as with my old conair.  But the hot tools 1073 is by far and away the best choice between the new version of the conair hot air brush of the same size.  It has adequate heat to curl and the conair the way it is now is absolutely useless.  So all in all I can live with this purchase.  However, if you do have very thick hair and you are trying to curl the ends, or for that matter any part of your hair, then I suggest you look on amazons selection of PROFESSIONAL salon styling aids, and then read the reviews carefully.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old one which was 7-8 years old.</li>
    <li> I have never liked to blow dry my hair because it always leaves it feelings frizzy and dry and it takes forever. This product is much easier to use than a blow drier and works pretty quickly. My hair is still a little frizzy when I&#x27;m done but if I use some serum or sleep on it, it calms down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because I don&#x27;t like having to use 2 hands to blow dry my hair and this is much faster.</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered this kind of hair tool long ago! I have stick straight hair and get crazy bed head. This airbrush gives my hair shape, smoothness, and body! I use velcro rollers to hold the hair in place to cool as I hot air brush other sections.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, the only problem is going abroad and I have brunt 3 of them in China, Sinapore, England even with a converter. I wish they could have one athat handles 110v-250v.</li>
    <li> It takes forever to dry my hair with this.  But once dry it does a good job.</li>
    <li> This is the (3rd) Hot Tools hot air brush of this same kind that I have owned in the past 10 years. They are long lasting. I love what it does to my hair. It straightens, shines and makes my hair silky and smooth as well as adds body to my hair. I just love it.</li>
    <li> i was sooooo excited about this products and i figures going with Hot Tools instead of other hair product companies id be safe if not have wonderful luck with this! the first one i received was damaged/not in working order and when i got my second one after, i kid you not, 3 trys i broke. (made a popping sound and started burning all the bristles off!) i didnt use this for my whole head of hair either! my plan was to use this only around my face and to volumize the top. its a great concept just a poor execution on the product its self. very disappointed</li>
    <li> One of the best styling tools I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I&#x27;m not a big appliance person when it comes to hair styling and have been disappointed in the past but this is really great.  I use it all the time and it does a great job smoothing my hair along with giving it a little up curl at the ends. It&#x27;s easy to work with too. I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I really like using this hair tool.&lt;br /&gt;only thing is that they burn out pretty quick.  i have purchased a few in the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;but i love the way it leaves my hair...&lt;br /&gt;always get compliments on my hair when i use it.</li>
    <li> I started using this hot air brush years ago when my hairdresser used it to style my hair. I have tried a few different brands, but I keep returning to this one. After washing my hair, I partially dry hair with a blow dryer and complete styling with the hot air brush. (I have not used a curling iron, etc. since.) It leaves my hair full of body and shine. (This brand does burn out after a year and a half or so. I have replaced mine 3 times. I am not thrilled about that, but no other brand does as well!) FYI: Use a thermal spray for better results. I use Framesi Pro form. Love!</li>
    <li> Great for my bangs and for shorter or medium length hair or for thin hair.  For a full head of long, thick hair, partially blow dry first or it will take all day.</li>
    <li> This product is not useful for heavy and thick hair. My hair is always stuck on it. When I finish using it my hair is still heavy and even thicker. I don&#x27;t recommend it to thick and heavy hair.</li>
    <li> I miss my Revo rotating hairbrush :( and found this when I was looking for a replacement. For some reason I thought it rotated. Since the reviews were good on this product, I decided to try it. It&#x27;s okay but I still have to basically dry most of my hair before I use this or I&#x27;d be all day doing my hair. My hair is frizzy and moderately thick and it did not control that at all. It&#x27;s a good supplement but don&#x27;t throw out your regular hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  I bought one just like it several years ago.  Cuts the time I spend on my hair in half.</li>
    <li> This is my third one of these over the past several years. It has a much higher wattage than similar products in other brands. My local beauty supply no longer carried the thermal hot air brush so I tried another one they se sell a lot of. It just didn&#x27;t do the job so I returned it (and I absolutely hate to return things)  I found what I wanted online and ordered it. Now I am set until I wear this one out. I may Just buy a spare.</li>
    <li> I love this. I buy a new one every year or so as gifts.</li>
    <li> I have very thick long hair and this is the greatest tool ever made. It works great. It takes a little bit of practice but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using hot brush dryers for years. They make styling your hair easier much easier and faster then using a brush and dryer. I have fine wavy hair, I can make it look sleek, almost like my hair was done at a Salon. Yeah!!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair tool and is a must have !! I&#x27;m a hair dresser and I use this everyday. Easy to use, light weight, not damaging to your hair and soo much better and easier than using a round brush and a blow dryer to get that salon hair look! Great to have for short to medium hairstyles espically stacked bobs. I have wavy hair hair and I don&#x27;t even have to use my flat iron as much because the hot air brush straightens, smoothes and gives your hair extra body. I love the size and could not find this size barrel in stores or . Sally&#x27;s has them but they were $30 and up and target and Walmart has them but not this brand and did not get hot or the results I wanted. This is the best brand and size and I love the price I paid and got it in just in a couple of days ! Totally recommend this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Verified Purchase</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for the product, but it was ok for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Innovative tool which help you dry and style your hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> Using this for drying and curling hair is nice, but the tip gets pretty hot. I have another brand that does not have this problem. My grand daughter, age 9 loves this brush but I had to get her a different brand because of the brush having hot spots. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, there are others for a little more money that work better and don&#x27;t get too hot to the touch.</li>
    <li> Great results in minimal time, even for someone like me who is not proficient in beauty tools!! My naturally curly hair is straight in no time.</li>
    <li> This one is amazing for my hair. This is much batter then normal drier. After I use it, my hair is shinning. I love it.</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly, works great to smooth out my hair.  I use it after I have mostly dried my hair with a diffuser, blow dryer with a circular brush (on top especially).  My hair is naturally wavy and has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  I only wash my hair every few days (3-4max), and it stays nice the whole time.  I bought the 1-1/2&amp;#34; one, which is perfect for my shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Conair, but didn&#x27;t like the high air output.  It just blew my hair all around, and wouldn&#x27;t stay around the brush, so I returned it.  I also tried the Babyliss hot air (ion) dryer, but the barrel was so big, I had to return it too.  It is really only for very long hair, not shoulder length or shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair that is shorter than shoulder length, this size would still help you, but you might want to check if they also make a 1&amp;#34; or 3/4&amp;#34; barrel(hot tools).  I really like their brand.  It also has a button to push to release the barrel to easily let out the curl, if you like.  I use it both ways sometimes.  Great purchase. Highly recommend. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I love hot air brushes because I&amp;#34;m not coordinated enough to use both a circle brush AND a blowdryer. People would probably get hurt if I even attempted that. Hot air brushes combine the two, and this was a great option. It never overheated, and worked for a very long time before I finally wore it out. I don&#x27;t recall ever burning myself on it, and the soft bristles were great. Normally the ones I got had hard rubber or plastic bristles - these were the first more natural bristles I had ever used. I noticed that they had the effect of making my hair smoother and shinier much faster than when I used the hard plastic/rubber ones. This was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that this hot air brush would suit my needs because it is so hard to find 1.5 inch brush but I am disappointed. The bristles are much too short to hold my long thick hair and it gets extremely hot. I think this would be too dangerous for a child to use or be used on. Its construction is very cheap and I don&#x27;t think it will last long. I will keep it only because I have nothing else at the moment but will be looking for something much better. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my wife, she loves it! she uses it every morning  with no problems. i see nothing bad about it. highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I liked this product, but shortly after purchase the &amp;#34;on-off&amp;#34; switch quit working- that was ok, at least it was &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; when I plugged it in and could use the other temp settings.&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I noticed a loud noise  when I used it- it appeared a small piece of the housing near the intake vents on bottom broke off and had drifted inside- catching the fan.  No was to really fix this,  and today it totally died.&lt;br /&gt;Not an expensive item, but housing is very cheap and didn&#x27;t last a year.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful hair tool....gets hot quick!  Two settings.  The only complaint is the tip of the barrel gets really hot...too hot to touch after a couple minutes! I hold the top as I curl....abd it burns fingertips quick!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hot air styling tools I have ever owned.  Dries hair quickly and is very easy to handle.</li>
    <li> this is nice for blow drying small parts of your hair like your bangs. it doesnt work for anything else though because the bristles are very short</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to hold curls in my hair otherwise seems usesble... may give it to my teen grandchildren</li>
    <li> I have used the Hot Tools curling brush for several years.  I love the ease of use and the wonderful results on my fine straight hair.  My hair never looked better. My only problem with the product is that it does not last more than between 9 months and a year for me.  They lose power and smell hot.  I have tried other brands and haven&#x27;t liked those as much.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Makes fixing hair a one step process.  Woudl recommend this prov&#x3D;duct to any other buyer.  try it yiou will like it</li>
    <li> Really like this styling product.  Was using a curling iron before, but this works so much better, leaving my hair soft and shinny.  Curl is soft and last as long or a little longer then the curling iron, too.  Price was great, since i&#x27;ve spotted this in some stores costing a lot more.  It really does NOT tangle my hair which is a bit shorter then shoulder length.  This is a keeper..</li>
    <li> I already reviewed this from previous orders but in case you missed it, I have gone through about a half dozen of these over the past dozen years or so. They last about two years with daily use on long hair. For the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!!!</li>
    <li> Broke in about two months. I love hot tools curling irons but this one fell very short.</li>
    <li> I was really attached to my old hot air brush but this one exceeds it:  my natural hair goes from an Afro to silky straight in minutes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was a blow dryer and curling brush in one.  I was looking for a curling brush, heat activiated.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and this hot styling tool works really well to smooth out my hair. It does blow a little to hard and makes the shorter ends fly up. I just flip the switch down to the cooler setting and it doesn&#x27;t blow as hard. Glad I bought this tool.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything would not get tangled in my hair but, as advertised, this really is tangle free.  I&#x27;m not a stylist.  In fact, I&#x27;m a real disaster when it comes to styling hair,  Not once have I had to cut this thing out of my hair.  I consider that a success!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, easy to use, with great results. This is probably my third and I will continue to replace it in the event it wears out.</li>
    <li> This is the one my wife said was used on her hair when she got it cut and styled last.  So we got this one for her.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and quality.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first how it would be with my hair because my hair is so thick. But so far I have been happy with the results. Once I used it on my hair after I washed it, I was sold on this item. It is a must have.</li>
    <li> LOVE this item.  So sad that they no longer make it.</li>
    <li> I wanted a hot hair brush that did not have attachments.  It has both a high and low setting.  Works great and gives my fine hair lift and volume.</li>
    <li> This curling brush gets very hot and you must be careful to avoid burning your hand.  I have not had a lot of luck with this brand for curling brushes, but I do favor their curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of curling iron I can use.  The brush grabs the ends of my hair and makes a nice relaxed curl.  When I use curling irons without the brush, I always end up with fish tails in the back.  I don&#x27;t think this would work if you want tight curls, but If you just want a little body and curl this is perfect.</li>
    <li> This hair tool is fantastic for my straight, very fine hair.  The heat is great and the curl release I love!  I have used this product for years now.  The first one I had lasted years and this one that I have now went out on me and is not blowing hot air and I have only had it max 2 years.  So I have gone and bought another one!  I am lost without it!</li>
    <li> Eaxactly what I wanted and needed to style my hair. I have used this product for years and was unable to find it anywhere in town, so was very happy when I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this item - it&#x27;s my second one.  The first one lasted me OVER 15 years.  I love the way it straightens and curls.  Recommend</li>
    <li> great styling tool.  Heats up rapidly and styles hair with little problems. I will order another so I will always have one on hand.</li>
    <li> I used this product one time and the air was hot enough to dry my hair but it did not leave my hair very smooth. I have very thick hair and the bristles were not long enough to hold my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I am hair dryer/round brush - challenged, so there is no way I can blow dry my hair using those two items at ones (the way they do at the salon). So, I use this round brush for blow drying the top layer, concentrating at the roots and creating volume and bounce. Then you could curl the rest of it (when it&#x27;s dry, of course!), apply some product and you&#x27;ll have big, voluminous, supermodel-looking hair.</li>
    <li> Such a low quality ! Definitely the worse hairstyling tool I ever had !!! You have to be very careful when you use it can burn your hands and hair ! After 2 weeks it was nowhere near to be used ever again !!</li>
    <li> No tangles, easy to use.  Two settings are great.  Recommended by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Some ratings complain about a hot tip, but I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case.</li>
    <li> Love this makes blow drying my hair simple.  Adds volume to fine hair. A must have.</li>
    <li> works wonderfully and great value for the price !</li>
    <li> I am not good at doing my own hair at ALL and I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time but I am actually able to use this tool no problem and within 5 minutes I have a salon look. It works wonders! I tend to get frizzy out of control hair after washing. I use this when my hair is dry and it smooths and adds a nice finished look to the ends. So my comments are that it&#x27;s very easy to use and it works beautifully. I feel I get great results and it did not cost me a fortune.</li>
    <li> Love this tool.  I use it every day and it is not only so easy to use, but the effect is always great.  I don&#x27;t think I could live without this product.</li>
    <li> My hair stayed straight as a bone in the hot humidity, im natural and I loved the curl release button</li>
    <li> I had a similar tool in France which was GREAT, but unfortunately i could not bring it to US because of different electric system. So  I bought this tool online, it looked similar to my French brush.  The quality is definitely inferior - gets too hot, doesn&#x27;t have much choice of spead/ heat setting; is noisy, and I have an impression it contributes to hair breakage more than other tools I have used...  I use it on the lowest setting, in the absence of a better tool, but would gladly switch for something better as soon as I find it</li>
    <li> I had an earlier model of this air brush and after many years of use it developed a small crack.  Fearing it was on its last leg I ordered a new one.  I was hoping they had kept it the same as it worked great to tame my thick wavy, frizzy hair, but unfortunately the bristles are shorter now and not as stiff as the original.  they also modified the handle... previous handle was softer, this one is now a hard, thin plastic.  I certainly did not get the same results.  I will continue to use the old one and cross my fingers that it won&#x27;t ever break.</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t love this anymore.  She says this product is the bomb.  She works with make up artists and they told her to get one of these.  She uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> The hot tool is too hot. I don&#x27;t use it that often...the air and the barrel gets too hot and can easily burn your skin if you are not careful!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought many over the years and love it.</li>
    <li> this product isgood and easy to use with multiple fonctions.&lt;br /&gt;The curls made are very natural and it will not hurt the hair</li>
    <li> I wear my hair very short and have a lot of trouble getting it to look as good as my hairdresser does. She recommended one of these so I would have better control over using a bulky hair dryer.  I do  a much better job but still not as good as her.</li>
    <li> out of the box, it worked fine.  after 2 months, if failed to work.  absolutely nothing happens when you plug it in and turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it makes no sense to return it for repair, because the warranty states that a $10 return shipping fee is required.  add this to the postal fee for shipping the unit to be repaired and it is senseless to do so.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this. It gets hot enough to style as well as dry. It is one piece and I love that. Nothing falling off or need to change barrels. Just watch the tip it is small and gets hot.</li>
    <li> This product works so good. But, because it gets so hot, I wear a cotton glove on my left hand and hold the hot tool in my right hand. I never have to worry about burning my fingers and I can hold the hair against the hot tool and get great results. I use it after I shampoo my hair but I also use it on dry hair just to straighten it in between.</li>
    <li> Can not get dressed without it!! Perfect to straighten hair and to keep it looking like you just got out of a salon.</li>
    <li> This is a really bad idea for a curling tool.  Don&#x27;t try it.  The end gets hot and there isn&#x27;t anything to hang on to.  Bad idea from a really good product line.</li>
    <li> my old one broke and i had it for years. this new one is great, heats up and does its job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I already had a similar one, but this one has very small bristles, making the Hair modelling and curling much harder,it is Very weak in power</li>
    <li> This was literally exactly what I wanted but could not find anywhere! I got a great deal and my hair isn&#x27;t so fried!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to replace another hot air brush I was using. I have worked in many salons where professionals have used Hot Tools products so when I read the reviews I didn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this. Upon receiving the product and opening the package, I immediatley thought it felt cheap. It is only 800 watts and it took forever to dry my hair, which is not very long or thick. After using it twice it stopped woking and smelled like it was burning. I wish I could return it, don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I bought a 1000 watt version of this brush about three years ago and loved it.  It worked perfectly the entire time I had it, I used it nearly every day.  It just died.  I bought this one as a replacement.  I could not be more disappointed.  Within three months it started to overheat and burn my skin and my hair.  It is now in the trash.  This product should be recalled as it is defective and dangerous.</li>
    <li> I specifically bought this brush roller/hair dryer because of the tangle-release button.  Straight out of the box, the tangle-release button didn&#x27;t work, not once, not ever.  The amount of trouble it&#x27;s going to take me to re-package it, re-box it, and return it, is not worth it.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> got burned in less than 2 months, It&#x27;s been beryl used. any idea what to do??? is there any warranty on it?</li>
    <li> Maybe it is me, but I could not seem to get this to work on my hair.  I suspect that it would work well on shorter hair however.</li>
