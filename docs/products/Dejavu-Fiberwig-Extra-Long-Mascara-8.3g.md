      <li>the same.&lt;br /&gt;i was really happy with the product</li>
      <li>Great mascara.</li>
      <li>Especially great for lashes that just don&#x27;t seem to grow any more.</li>
      <li>If you have lashes you can probably find products that do a fairly comparable job...</li>
      <li>Fiberwig was delivered in timely manner in good condition.</li>
      <li>Good value</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with looking like a racoon, and that is surprising because I&#x27;m always having to use eye drops for my contacts.</li>
      <li>I love love love this mascara!!!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this mascara!</li>
      <li>I love it and is on my shopping lust whenever I need it !</li>
      <li>I really liked ordering from this company..</li>
      <li>To remove make-up just some warm water.</li>
      <li>It stays on with out flaking and it washes off with warm water.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t add the length I was expecting, altho it gave good coverage, didn&#x27;t smear and was easy to remove.  </li>
      <li>I got it on time, I love this mascara, you have to be used to this kind with fivers</li>
      <li>The first time I ordered this product it was great.  </li>
      <li>and it is very comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>The brush does help curl the lashes, and the stiffness of the &amp;#34;gloves&amp;#34; help hold the curl better than most mascaras.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic mascara!</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I had tried some many brands and it smudges all the time.</li>
      <li>Waterproof mascaras are just a beast to remove and I feel like I am ripping off most of my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve bought mascara from Japan which does a better job.</li>
      <li>but it should be more thicker otherwise</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>this is now my number one favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>It is better than blinc brand mascara, and it also curls and stays in place better than the clinic mascaras that tube your lashes.  </li>
      <li>you have to apply lot more</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say it is a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>It is easy to remove and is very useful for people with NO LASHES at all...which would be me!  </li>
      <li>Clean up is a breeze though!</li>
      <li>It is a great product for short lashes; easy to remove with warm water and doesn&#x27;t flake during the day.</li>
      <li>It does go on and stay on, and comes off easily with soap and water or lotion.</li>
      <li>This stays on all day &amp; when it comes to cleaning, it&#x27;s so easy unlike waterproof mascara that could pull or rip off you lashes.</li>
      <li>Even then, I love the fact that the mascara comes off cleanly -- still no raccoon eyes.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- lasts all day, even after my 12 hour night shift&lt;br /&gt;-waterproof, but easily removed with oil based eye makeup remover</li>
      <li>It washes off easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and keep coming back to this GREAT mascara.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to pinch your lashes in the shower and wiggles them back and forth to get the gloves to come off nice and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Yes, there are certainly brands that are better than others but over the course of the day, I am wiping some smudge from under my eyes.</li>
      <li>After that, it dries &amp; thickens up and is much easier to work with, plus will add more volume.</li>
      <li>I even got a sweet note, origami and candy with my order.</li>
      <li>I still enjoy wearing make-up, but love the natural look.  </li>
      <li>I am purchasing the natural brown color today, as my hair is very light &amp; I am excited to try this.</li>
      <li>It is great for everyday use.  </li>
      <li>it will take lot more of busy morning of my time.</li>
      <li>It is  lovely &amp; so natural.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin, and most mascaras either flake or smudge within an hour or two (to the point that I pretty much never wear the stuff).  </li>
      <li>does come off pretty easily with warm water, like little tubes, and the rest comes right off with my Clarins waterproof eye makeup removed.</li>
      <li>It is very easily removed with just facial oil, but removes even better with actual eye-makeup remover.</li>
      <li>Nice mascara, nice dark black color and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to my friends!!</li>
      <li>It was my first time trying to get it on line.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different mascaras.</li>
      <li>Really extends the length of your lashes but it requires time and patience!</li>
      <li>Was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s latex-y, once it&#x27;s dry, the smudge will pop right off with the flick of an eye-shadow brush, not smear like most mascaras.</li>
      <li>(totally budge-proof through my most intense workouts) and when you&#x27;re ready to take it off, a few seconds in warm water will dissolve it and it peels away.</li>
      <li>Just a little bit of warm water</li>
      <li>Fiberwig really makes lashes longer</li>
      <li>I just wash my face in the morning &amp; I am ready to use again.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery too.  </li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t make my lashes that much longer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Blinc mascara as well, and I did not like it as much as Fiberwig.</li>
      <li>but it really make your eye lashes longer and easy to take off too, just wet eye lash</li>
      <li>the mascara is new and juicy, the ink can be gloppy if there&#x27;s too much on the brush, so you have to almost take some off with some tissue</li>
      <li>OK, but slightly clumpy on the applicator.</li>
      <li>This was actually my very first fiber mascara experience going back some 8 - 9 years.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend trying this mascara.</li>
      <li>the estimated shipping date seemed very far off, but it actually arrived fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>The fibers work beautifully to extend my lashes and combined with my use of latisse, I get asked if I&#x27;m wearing falsies all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: the first two weeks of use, the product is too thin and wet.</li>
      <li>Deja Vu Fiberwig stays on, even through most heavy duty work outs/sweat sessions</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell a major difference to my other mascara, perhaps that it locks on to the lashes a bit more.</li>
      <li>There are far better ones out there over the counter for less money.</li>
      <li>and I was only able to use it 3-4 times before it was empty.  </li>
      <li>As far as making your eyelashes longer, it does decent job.</li>
      <li>Outside of waterproof mascaras, I have not found any regular mascara that does not eventually run, even with a light coat.</li>
      <li>It looks completely natural and is a breeze to take off!</li>
      <li>There are comparable products available on the market for half the</li>
      <li>This one did not wow me more than amy other.</li>
      <li>Extends your eyelashes for a natural look, not clumpy and comes off easy with make up remover or just plain soap and water.</li>
      <li>I have tried other mascaras but always seem to come back to this because it does not run at all, and comes off easily.</li>
      <li>I like the natural look, but you can layer it if you like the thicker voluminous look.  </li>
      <li>Thus far products has been legit as well as timely delivery.</li>
      <li>Its completely waterproof.</li>
      <li>The only downside to this product is that it doesn&#x27;t volumize much, but it does lengthen.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-extend lashes that look natural</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara for a few years now, and I regularly sample every mascara I can (perks of being a pro makeup artist!).</li>
      <li>I have moderately to long lashes, but they are straight and blond.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s difficult and messy to apply and it&#x27;s necessary to have a clean spoolie handy to get it on right/comb out lashes.</li>
      <li>The only mascara that does not smear; no black eyes at the end of the day!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite mascara for a few years now, and I regularly sample every mascara I can (perks of being a pro makeup artist!). I discovered it at sephora but they no longer carry it. I hate regular waterproof formulas since they can be sticky and most are way too difficult to remove (the residue can clog your lash follicles and make them fall out!), but with Miami&#x27;s humidity waterproof is a necessity. This formula is similar to a rubbery latex- it dries to a flexible, waterproof seal (totally budge-proof through my most intense workouts) and when you&#x27;re ready to take it off, a few seconds in warm water will dissolve it and it peels away. The fibers work beautifully to extend my lashes and combined with my use of latisse, I get asked if I&#x27;m wearing falsies all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: the first two weeks of use, the product is too thin and wet. It&#x27;s difficult and messy to apply and it&#x27;s necessary to have a clean spoolie handy to get it on right/comb out lashes. After that, it dries &amp; thickens up and is much easier to work with, plus will add more volume. Clean up is a breeze though! Since it&#x27;s latex-y, once it&#x27;s dry, the smudge will pop right off with the flick of an eye-shadow brush, not smear like most mascaras.</li>
    <li> I love love love this mascara!!! This was actually my very first fiber mascara experience going back some 8 - 9 years. I have since tried other brands, however none came close to Dejavu. Other mascaras claiming to be fiber, still have dyes that smear and are hard to take off. Fiberwig really makes lashes longer but I think its best feature is staying power! Literally I have went to sleep and woke up the next day with my lashes looking completely intact. Its completely waterproof. I wear it on the beach and at the pool. It looks completely natural and is a breeze to take off! Just a little bit of warm water and it comes right off in little rubbery tubes. I think it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other mascaras and probably a little more pricier, but in my humble opinion completely worth it!</li>
    <li> The only mascara that does not smear; no black eyes at the end of the day! Highly recommend trying this mascara.</li>
    <li> This mascara is may fav! This comes off without have to wipe hard. The only downfall is that the brush/wand gets clumpy and caked up. This is still a get product!</li>
    <li> I started using fiberwig about 4 months ago but Sephora stopped carrying it so I bought this version from amazon. It&#x27;s not nearly the same quality, not as thick and long lasting. Imitation!</li>
    <li> There are comparable products available on the market for half the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting more out of the product and was disappointed with the results.</li>
    <li> I purchased on June 24th and received on June 39th. Packed in padded envelope, with &amp;#34;peanuts&amp;#34; and in a blister pack.</li>
    <li> Prompt Shipping . Product as described !</li>
    <li> You can wear contacts with this mascara. Even though it has fibers, they don&#x27;t fall off into your eyes and it never looks clumpy.  I have thin, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking lashes that are super long.</li>
    <li> Great mascara. Lasts all day long!</li>
    <li> Fantastic mascara! I have Asian lashes &amp; this makes my mascara so long. I had tried some many brands and it smudges all the time. This stays on all day &amp; when it comes to cleaning, it&#x27;s so easy unlike waterproof mascara that could pull or rip off you lashes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last three years and is my go to mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-extend lashes that look natural&lt;br /&gt;- lasts all day, even after my 12 hour night shift&lt;br /&gt;-waterproof, but easily removed with oil based eye makeup remover&lt;br /&gt;- Good value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-when the mascara is new and juicy, the ink can be gloppy if there&#x27;s too much on the brush, so you have to almost take some off with some tissue</li>
    <li> I read about it on The Grommet, and figured that they were up on the coolest things, so I tried it. Meh. It&#x27;s ok. It does go on and stay on, and comes off easily with soap and water or lotion. But its like smooth...glossy paint. It doesn&#x27;t extend or thicken lashes, it just paints them. That may be just what you need. I wear it on days when I&#x27;m just running around, and want to color my lashes, not accentuate my eyes.</li>
    <li> This mascara is excellent!  It stays on until you take it off with water. I have always had problems with mascara staying on my lashes.  Usually by the end of the day other mascaras, whether water proof or not, would end up under my eyes not on my lashes.  Dejavu Fiberwig mascara stays put.  You will have extroidnary long lashes too!</li>
    <li> It was a shame that Sephora stopped carrying this a few years ago. I have tried other mascaras but always seem to come back to this because it does not run at all, and comes off easily. I hate having to worry about mascara that gives you raccoon eyes. Outside of waterproof mascaras, I have not found any regular mascara that does not eventually run, even with a light coat. Yes, there are certainly brands that are better than others but over the course of the day, I am wiping some smudge from under my eyes. Waterproof mascaras are just a beast to remove and I feel like I am ripping off most of my eyelashes. Deja Vu Fiberwig stays on, even through most heavy duty work outs/sweat sessions (I work out after I come home from work and don&#x27;t take off my makeup beforehand). I have had some incidents where the mascara has come off during heavy workout sessions, but usually it is due to my rubbing my eyes. Even then, I love the fact that the mascara comes off cleanly -- still no raccoon eyes. I&#x27;ve tried Blinc mascara as well, and I did not like it as much as Fiberwig. The only downside to this product is that it doesn&#x27;t volumize much, but it does lengthen.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara! It used to be sold at Sephora and was discontinued. I was happy to find this seller still has the product. It is easy to remove and is very useful for people with NO LASHES at all...which would be me!  If you have lashes you can probably find products that do a fairly comparable job...but if you have NO lashes this mascara is great, because you do not have to spend all day applying layers to get length. The plus is that it does not feel all tacky and dry like other lash building mascaras. Another plus is that I don&#x27;t have to lose any lashes to get it off and it is very comfortable to wear. I really liked ordering from this company..the estimated shipping date seemed very far off, but it actually arrived fairly quickly. I give this product a 5 star rating!</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for several years.  It was my first time trying to get it on line.  What a disappointment.  The mascara was dried out &amp; unusable.  There was no receipt with a return address or I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> Have used this mascara for years.  Lengthens and thickens.</li>
    <li> This is not the mascara I was hoping for. It is thin and flaked off all day. I would return it if it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle- disappointing.</li>
    <li> It washes off easily.  It is great for everyday use.  I can&#x27;t believe Sephora stopped carrying it.  This is the only mascara I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It stays on with out flaking and it washes off with warm water. I would highly recommend this to my friends!!</li>
    <li> Been using this mascara for yrs. It&#x27;s a must have for me. Love it.. Been purchasing the mascara from Amazon for a year and a half. Thus far products has been legit as well as timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Quality product which never pours. Finished the eyes of panda at the end of the day&lt;br /&gt;top quality ! To remove make-up just some warm water.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t run or smudge for me! I was devastated when sephora stopped carrying it. I only wish it came with prime shipping!</li>
    <li> Everyone noticed my lashes were longer they thought they were false ones ! I love it and is on my shopping lust whenever I need it !</li>
    <li> If you have short eyelashes this works wonders. Extends your eyelashes for a natural look, not clumpy and comes off easy with make up remover or just plain soap and water. When I run out I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! Really extends the length of your lashes but it requires time and patience! It has small fibers that adhere to your lashes and lengthen</li>
    <li> I like it but it should be more thicker otherwise you have to apply lot more&lt;br /&gt;and it will take lot more of busy morning of my time.</li>
    <li> I got it on time, I love this mascara, you have to be used to this kind with fivers but it really make your eye lashes longer and easy to take off too, just wet eye lash and it come out inmediately</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t add the length I was expecting, altho it gave good coverage, didn&#x27;t smear and was easy to remove.  Wouldn&#x27;t order it again</li>
    <li> I like how this mascara doesn&#x27;t EVER run. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with looking like a racoon, and that is surprising because I&#x27;m always having to use eye drops for my contacts. As far as making your eyelashes longer, it does decent job. I have asian eyes and I&#x27;ve bought mascara from Japan which does a better job.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different mascaras. This one did not wow me more than amy other. It is a little fibrous but did not transform my lashes. I use lattise and have a descent lashes to begin with so I expected them to really pop. It is not a wet, thick mascara, it is smooth. I did not mind it, however, i will not re-order it. There are far better ones out there over the counter for less money.</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered this product it was great.  This is the second order and it was not satisfactory.  The tube was nearly empty ( or dried up) and I was only able to use it 3-4 times before it was empty.  The times I did use it, it made my eyes itch.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and keep coming back to this GREAT mascara.  Especially great for lashes that just don&#x27;t seem to grow any more.</li>
    <li> I have moderately to long lashes, but they are straight and blond.  I have very oily skin, and most mascaras either flake or smudge within an hour or two (to the point that I pretty much never wear the stuff).  This mascara is what they call a &amp;#34;tubing&amp;#34; mascara, meaning when the mascara dries, it basically forms little gloves around each lash.  The brush does help curl the lashes, and the stiffness of the &amp;#34;gloves&amp;#34; help hold the curl better than most mascaras.  Be sure to pinch your lashes in the shower and wiggles them back and forth to get the gloves to come off nice and smoothly.  Occasionally, I forget to do this, and just the tips come off, and sometimes then it can flake into your eye (nothing too irritating, just like getting dust in them or whatever).  Sleeping in them also causes this flaking.  BUT it holds up well to crying and sweating (as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes).  The occasional forgetful rub doesn&#x27;t disturb it too much.  I like the natural look, but you can layer it if you like the thicker voluminous look.  It is better than blinc brand mascara, and it also curls and stays in place better than the clinic mascaras that tube your lashes.  I am allergic to EVERYTHING, and I have never had an issue with this mascara.  My oily skin doesn&#x27;t disturb it.  Overall, I&#x27;d say it is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> No clumps, no running, and long lashes (: this is now my number one favorite mascara. No complains here. Yup</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever!!!  If I have a few short lashes I can even brush on fiber specifically on those short ones to lengthen them.  This not only lengthens lashes but thickens them too.  When I was my eyes at the end of the day I see tons of fibers in the sink!  Can&#x27;t imagine using any other mascara now that I discovered this one  Genius!</li>
    <li> OK, but slightly clumpy on the applicator. I couldn&#x27;t tell a major difference to my other mascara, perhaps that it locks on to the lashes a bit more.</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t make my lashes that much longer and I think it takes a bit of time to put on.  But, what I do like is that I only have to put it on once and it last for the day without leaving any smudges under my eyes!  I like that!</li>
    <li> Fiberwig was delivered in timely manner in good condition. It is a great product for short lashes; easy to remove with warm water and doesn&#x27;t flake during the day. It is still on by the end of the day, even when it&#x27;s applied in the morning!</li>
    <li> it was like the product i that i have bought from hong kong the same.&lt;br /&gt;i was really happy with the product</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004H9L95A Dejavu Fiberwig Extra Long Mascara 8.3g]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is so great.  My daughter bought it for me.  (Thank you luv!) I was tired of waking up with the &#x27;raccoon eye&#x27; look every morning, even after using eye make-up remover the previous night! I am 52, I am done with that nonsense!  I still enjoy wearing make-up, but love the natural look.  I never have to remove this mascara!  I just wash my face in the morning &amp; I am ready to use again.  It is  lovely &amp; so natural.  I am purchasing the natural brown color today, as my hair is very light &amp; I am excited to try this.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara, nice dark black color and goes on smooth. The only thing is the fibers don&#x27;t start to stick to the ends and extends until it gets a little tacky and this brand does not add curl (as previously reviewed). My search for a mascara goes on.&lt;br /&gt;This does come off pretty easily with warm water, like little tubes, and the rest comes right off with my Clarins waterproof eye makeup removed.</li>
    <li> This mascara stays put all day, leaving my lashes clump-free! It is very easily removed with just facial oil, but removes even better with actual eye-makeup remover. The only downside to my purchase is that the cap broke a few days after I received it, so now I can&#x27;t properly screw the mascara fully shut. It doesn&#x27;t affect me though, because the mascara hasn&#x27;t dried out or anything because of it.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. I returned it and won&#x27;t be repurchasing ever. I thought it would be similar to the DJV Beautenizer Fiberwig but with extra lengthening, but not so.</li>
    <li> Best Mascare Ever! Fast delivery too.  Keep it in stock!</li>
    <li> Was exactly what i was looking for. I even got a sweet note, origami and candy with my order.</li>
