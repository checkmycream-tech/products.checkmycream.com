      <li>Love the fact that its plastic backed.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
      <li>Well I ordered these plates because I liked how you got many designs on one plate verses the little disks from Konad.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying these plates so far.</li>
      <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>But well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>I will purchase more cheeky plates and new designs in the future! :)</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would order the other plates in the series!</li>
      <li>I would purchase Cheeky plates again, but not without first ensuring they don&#x27;t have the cutouts.</li>
      <li>The only thing that is important is to find out the right nail polish that works well with this product as all nail polish doesn&#x27;t work</li>
      <li>Very high quality plates.</li>
      <li>They came pretyy fast cuZ</li>
      <li>However; I really like the designs on these 3 plates.</li>
      <li>I also purchased the Konda stamper which works really well</li>
      <li>I havent used these in a real mani</li>
      <li>Very clear and crisp</li>
      <li>All of the other designs more than make up for it.</li>
      <li>I love for me there so many different ones that when you put the Polish and do a specific color a lot of people to not see me I love the design from my secret</li>
      <li>And yes, I use regular polishes and not the special Konad stamping polish.</li>
      <li>So far all the images I have tried are etched deep enough and stamp nicely.  </li>
      <li>I should have saved my money and just stuck with the nice small box of cheeky plates</li>
      <li>The lines come out clear, and haven&#x27;t had any real problems.</li>
      <li>I got these to try out because normally the \\&quot;real\\&quot; plates go for 25 bucks EACH.  </li>
      <li>Very clear images.</li>
      <li>The first time it did but the secind third</li>
      <li>Took a little too long receive them but considering that they were coming from Hong Kong is fair enough .</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re really particular, get a set of nail art polishes in different colors as your stamping polish because they have high pigment.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stamp as clearly as shown.</li>
      <li>Images are very deep so get captured very well.</li>
      <li>may have to be patient to receive them since they are coming from so far.</li>
      <li>My nails are long and it&#x27;d be better of there didn&#x27;t come with the half moon.</li>
      <li>There is a lot of variety and the designs are very large, much bigger than Konad and they make stamping on thumbs and long finger nails easier.</li>
      <li>I thought it was strange that I received these so fast after reading all the reviews.  </li>

<li> but the etching is so deep it is  very hard to clean these plates.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is the half moon cutouts on the full sized images.</li>
<li> I only want to change for the pink case of plates</li>
<li> The blue plastic was easy to remove, the plates come with backing which add stability to the plate and keeps you from cutting yourself.  </li>
<li> My only concern is the snake skin print and a couple other \\&quot;animal\\&quot; prints on plate</li>
<li> Not one single template works.  </li>
<li> I have tried EVERY single stamping image</li>
<li> (some are pretty ugly) but they stamp really well.</li>
<li> Also, plate A has some duplicates if you look carefully.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s why I asked for a change for the cheeky pink plates</li>
<li> The designs are too shallow to pick up enough polish to create a nice even stamp, and the flower designs are terrible.</li>
<li> There not very good.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of stamping; so I&#x27;m not not exactly good at it just yet.</li>
<li> Disappointed at not being what I expected</li>
<li> I purchased the ones at target or wallgreens and have never had any luck getting the images onto my nails, so I was skeptical to purchase these..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I decided to get these after watching some reviews on YouTube. I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of stamping; so I&#x27;m not not exactly good at it just yet. However; I really like the designs on these 3 plates. There was a scratch/flaw on plate A but it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the design. For the price I think it&#x27;s a good deal!</li>
    <li> I got these to try out because normally the \\&quot;real\\&quot; plates go for 25 bucks EACH.  The blue plastic was easy to remove, the plates come with backing which add stability to the plate and keeps you from cutting yourself.  So far all the images I have tried are etched deep enough and stamp nicely.  The full nail images are larger than konad and that is very nice. I think the only issue I might have is from plate E.  They should be etched finer if that makes sense.  Granted I havent used these in a real mani yet so they may be fine.  They stamped well on paper it just seems like the detail on that plate could have been finer.  Overall you cant beat the price and they will get used and I will purchase others</li>
    <li> Well I ordered these plates because I liked how you got many designs on one plate verses the little disks from Konad. I have been using them for a while now and all the designs seem to stamp really nicely. My only concern is the snake skin print and a couple other \\&quot;animal\\&quot; prints on plate D. They don&#x27;t stamp as clearly as shown. All of the other designs more than make up for it. There is a lot of variety and the designs are very large, much bigger than Konad and they make stamping on thumbs and long finger nails easier. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would order the other plates in the series!</li>
    <li> Nice set. My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> My plates came with no blue plastic, leading me to think possibly they were returned and then resold. The designs are too shallow to pick up enough polish to create a nice even stamp, and the flower designs are terrible. I should have saved my money and just stuck with the nice small box of cheeky plates I have that I loved.</li>
    <li> I like these plates. The quality is good, but the designs kind of suck. Also, plate A has some duplicates if you look carefully.</li>
    <li> I loved these desdesigns they are great I love for me there so many different ones that when you put the Polish and do a specific color a lot of people to not see me I love the design from my secret I&#x27;ll never tell</li>
    <li> Great product! Way better than the konad stencils.&lt;br /&gt;However the delay for reception was almost a month... Which is not convenient.</li>
    <li> These stamping plates are pretty awesome! I have tried EVERY single stamping image and I get not only a good detailed image, but great coverage over the whole nail. This product pays for itself for those who like to go to the nail salon and get nail art.  I save alot of money by doing my own. And yes, I use regular polishes and not the special Konad stamping polish. If you&#x27;re really particular, get a set of nail art polishes in different colors as your stamping polish because they have high pigment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying these plates so far. The images and details transfer quite nicely. My only complaint is the half moon cutouts on the full sized images. I don&#x27;t understand that aspect of the design.  Now that my nails are growing, the cutout issue is more of a problem. The set is perfectly etched, though, and I&#x27;m waiting for my squishy stamper to arrive so I can find out if stretching the image helps. I would purchase Cheeky plates again, but not without first ensuring they don&#x27;t have the cutouts. For people with shorter nails, this set is perfect, but as mine grow, I find I have to use dotting tools or brushes to fill in the gaps.</li>
    <li> Great, great, great nail stamping plates.  Wonderful quality for a great price.  I have already order a different set.  Do not wait to buy these because once the word is out, they&#x27;re going to sell like hot cakes!!!</li>
    <li> It took awhile to get here but it was worth the wait. I have large nail beds so these are perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Not one single template works.  They were all scratched.  And I only received plates 4, 5, and 6.  Where are the others?  I thought it was strange that I received these so fast after reading all the reviews.  SAVE YOUR MONEY PEOPLE.</li>
    <li> I love this product and everything about it. It was smaller than I had thought but its so cute that it is worth every penny; and I&#x27;m not just saying that becuase it also works great. I have tried one image on each plate and they came out very good.</li>
    <li> These plates are awesome. Very clear images. Not a lot to choose. mostly duplicates. plates stamps just fine. Very clear and crisp but the etching is so deep it is  very hard to clean these plates.  I don&#x27;t think these are better than the shany xxl plates. you get way more for the money and the images are nice</li>
    <li> Disappointed at not being what I expected but the printing is good when cleaning the plate is a disaster that&#x27;s why I asked for a change for the cheeky pink plates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t wanted this items I love if you can change this for me, the plastic protector was removed because I taste it but this don&#x27;t work I only want to change for the pink case of plates cheeky please I think that you have to make happy to all your costumes so please only need to change...</li>
    <li> Thank you Cheeky&lt;br /&gt;The plate is awesome&lt;br /&gt;Great size images and a breeze to work with. Love the fact that its plastic backed.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product to everyone.I will certainly be back for more.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers deb</li>
    <li> I really liked it. The designs are big though, sometimes they overlap my fingernail but that might just be me. Easy to clean and pretty, detailed designs.</li>
    <li> I purchased the ones at target or wallgreens and have never had any luck getting the images onto my nails, so I was skeptical to purchase these.. However, I&#x27;m glad I did purchase them! I like most of the designs (some are pretty ugly) but they stamp really well. The lines come out clear, and haven&#x27;t had any real problems. I also purchased the Konda stamper which works really well too- I will purchase more cheeky plates and new designs in the future! :)</li>
    <li> Very high quality plates. We have purchased many others and these are the best at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;You may have to be patient to receive them since they are coming from so far. But well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I tried this product yesterday and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!!! I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my pretty nails :-). This stamping pad is awesome. Images are very deep so get captured very well. The only thing that is important is to find out the right nail polish that works well with this product as all nail polish doesn&#x27;t work and it &#x27;s not the fault of the stamping pad.</li>
    <li> There not very good. They came pretyy fast cuZ i got them in prime but rhey came scratched and didnt work. The first time it did but the secind third and so om disnt work at all</li>
    <li> I like the selections. I use most of them but some designs are just not my type. But overall, good selection of plates.</li>
    <li> Good stamping plates they all stamp perfect.  My nails are long and it&#x27;d be better of there didn&#x27;t come with the half moon.</li>
    <li> Very pleased !!! The designs were bigger so they cover nails . Good detail in designs ! Would buy an will buy more in future also pleased with price . :)</li>
    <li> Great quality, great design, great size. I cannot complain at all. Took a little too long receive them but considering that they were coming from Hong Kong is fair enough .</li>
