      <li>Still pretty good product in terms of size/design/price</li>

      <li>It has an easy to use mount for the dryer.</li>
      <li>Easy to mount.  </li>
      <li>Easy to mount on the wall.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I like the way it mounts and is so easy to use</li>
      <li>Worked fine for 6 months, then stopped working.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working just fine and meets my needs.</li>
      <li>The power is great and the setting are in a convenient place for switching between high, warm or hot, low warm.  </li>
      <li>so it does a great job and is light enough that drying your hair does not become a chore.</li>
      <li>After a wait of maybe 5 minutes, it makes another ping sound and works again.</li>
      <li>I bought this dryer 2 months ago, and even with light use, it has now quit working.</li>
      <li>That helps to free up counter space.  </li>
      <li>Very convenient, very strong, very hot,</li>
      <li>Cannot turn off heat settings for cool air-</li>
      <li>It needs to be more readily removable for home users.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still not a bad unit, it just has a flaw.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to mount with the included template or just use the metal backplate to mark the wall.  </li>
      <li>It does not heat as well as I think it should, barely adequate and would not purchase again.</li>
      <li>My wife, with shoulder length hair, refuses to use it because it turns off so quickly.  </li>
      <li>But since I prefer the high air/high heat it works ok for me.  </li>
      <li>It did not blow as strong and was much louder.  </li>
      <li>I have had four of these wall mounted hair dryers and love them, they are up and out of the way and stay pretty much un-noticable  </li>
      <li>My husband and I use it on a daily basis and love the convenience of having it on the wall for easy access.</li>
      <li>No big deal, but cosmetically, I would have liked the nozzle to face the mirror.  </li>
      <li>Low air has luke warm heat.  </li>
      <li>It puts out a concentrated stream of air that is not too hot but drys your hair quickly.</li>
      <li>The arrived quickly and at first glance, I was intimidated about installation.</li>
      <li>This one had the problem right off the bat.</li>
      <li>When it arrived - I was very pleased with how easy it was to mount on the wall in my rather small bathroom.  </li>
      <li>When I found this one I was pleased with the price, the wattage and the apparent look of it.</li>

      <li>The first one lasted for about 10 years.  </li>
      <li>So, I finished my hair with another dryer and thought about how much nicer it is to have one on the wall!    </li>
      <li>The first two were great--worked for years.  </li>
      <li>On the 2nd one of these and just love it.  </li>
      <li>I installed the first one 7 months ago.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my third Andis Hangup Pro Turbo Hair Dryer of this model over the past 15 years or so. My husband and I use it on a daily basis and love the convenience of having it on the wall for easy access. Product is very reliable. Must keep dust screen in back of handheld unit clean. It is very easy to clean as it unscrews. Wall mount has a reset button if unit shuts down due to overheating which doesn&#x27;t usually occur if screen is kept clean. Would purchase another of this product when needed.</li>
    <li> I love having the hair dryer off my sink.  It was easy to install, took me maybe 15 minutes.  I like the settings, the heat and speeds.  The only problem is the switch is difficult to get into the highest setting.</li>
    <li> I attached this great dryer to my wall in the master bathroom. It is secure and so nice not to have to dig the dryer out of a drawer or from under the sink. It looks fantastic and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the best we have found yet. It puts out a concentrated stream of air that is not too hot but drys your hair quickly. It has an easy to use mount for the dryer. Only negative is the instructions for mounting on the wall, which are backward, but once mounted it is a joy.</li>
    <li> Cannot turn off heat settings for cool air- that would be nice. Motor lasted exactly three years and then died a slow, stinky death. Otherwise, nicely built, handy and decent product.  Will consider again...</li>
    <li> Used it for about a year now, have had no problems! It was easy to install and works great! Keeps counter clear and is ready to use.</li>
    <li> Having the counter space is a great plus, but Andis dryer has plenty of drying power so it does a great job and is light enough that drying your hair does not become a chore. I love the ability to just put the drying on the wall mount while it is still running and reposition my brush, then remove the dryer and never miss a beat. I have had one in my bathroom for 3 years and I just purchased two more, one for the guest bath and one for my housesitter for christmas because she too love this product.</li>
    <li> When a small electrical appliance lasts 11 years, you look for a new one just like it.  I carefully checked the specs before ordering and didn&#x27;t even have to replace the wall bracket for the old dryer. Just mounted the new dryer in its place good to go for another 11 years!</li>
    <li> Over the years we have had a couple different Andis Wall Mounted units, including the #33700 with the bright green nightlight, and some other manufacturer models.  We like the Andis 33295/33490 the best.  In my wife&#x27;s bath, they typically last 3 years of everyday use on long hair.  I just replaced her Andis 33700 with the nightlight that we purchased in Jan 2007 with the Andis 33490 hardwired unit.  My wife likes it without the nightlight.  It was too bright.  Prior to buying another Andis, I did try the Oster 76932 wall mounted dryer.  My wife did not like it.  It did not blow as strong and was much louder.  After replacing hers, the Jerdon in my bathroom died.  I also decide to purchase the Andis.  Installation/Cosmetic caution - since mine is being installed of the wall to my left, the nozzle faced outward.  No big deal, but cosmetically, I would have liked the nozzle to face the mirror.  With the wall mounted units where the unit fits perpendicular to the wall, handedness is not an issue.    You may decide to drill additional mounting holes in the bracket if you can mount it to a stud.  The three mounting holes are triangular.  So, if you hit a stud with one, you will not with the other two.    Another plus with the Andis units with a plug, is that the GFI (big square control with reset) is inside the unit, not outside on the cord.  Also, the extra cord can be wrapped inside the unit so only the minimal amount is visible.  This makes a much cleaner installation.       I wish I could find an industrial strength luxury wall mounted dryer that is build to last a lifetime.  I have looked and cannot find one.  The field is rather limited.  In my opinion, this is the best of the bunch.</li>
    <li> This model replaces an earlier one that put out a lot of heat, but the replacement  one, while seemingly appearing to have been upgraded, does not put out the level of heat as the one I replaced after several years of use. That one \\&quot;died.\\&quot; Also, the digital clock is not included in the replacement model. That was a feature much appreciated so without it I feel a bit more of disapointment. However, the replacement model does look \\&quot;smart\\&quot; mounted on the bathroom wall.</li>
    <li> This was my 2nd attempt at a wall mounted hair dryer.  The first one was terrible.  The one I got rid of had a short barrel and sucked my hair into the intake in the back and ended up burning up the 3rd time I used it.  I&#x27;ve had this one a little over a month and it is so much better.  Easy to mount.  Easy to use.  I love that it turns off when you set it back in the cradle.  Cord gives enough to stretch down low when I blow dry my daughters hair.  Only negative is that there is no heat control.  High air setting has high heat.  Medium air has medium heat.  Low air has luke warm heat.  But since I prefer the high air/high heat it works ok for me.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE12/2012:  Around the beginning of 2012 the unit&#x27;s high setting stopped working.  Or rather it works intermittently.  Sometimes it will come on but most times it does not.  This makes it hard to dry thick or long hair.  The heat &amp; air volume on the other settings doesn&#x27;t cut it if you want to dry your hair quickly or if you have a lot of hair.  Still pretty good product in terms of size/design/price and maybe I&#x27;m expecting too long a life from a hair dryer, but I do know that most of the others dryers I&#x27;ve owned lasted 6-8 years.  Was hoping at least that much out of this one.</li>
    <li> THIS DRYER IS GREAT! FIRST, IT&#x27;S A LONG BARREL DRYER THAT, NOT TO MENTION, IS IONIZED. I HATE THOSE STUBBY ONES! IT&#x27;S SPEEDS ARE LOW,HIGH LOW/MEDIUM HEAT AND HIGH/HIGH HEAT. I LOVE THE HIGH LOW/MEDIUM HEAT BECAUSE YOU CAN DRY YOUR ROOTS FASTER W/O BURNING THE ALREADY DRY PARTS OF YOUR HAIR (LIKE THE TIPS). OVERALL 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> Mounted unit on wall per instructions and almost every time I used it, it would stop working before i finished drying my hair. I had to run fish my old blow dryer out of the trash to finish, keeping the old one on hand to use each time the Andis quit. And once it quit, I could not make it turn back on, no matter if I pressed the RESET &amp; the TEST buttons.    This unit has [quote from owners manual], \\&quot;an APPLIANCE LEAKAGE CIRCUIT INTERRUPTER (ALCI) safety device which will shut the dryer off (making it inoperable) under abnormal conditions, such as falling or being immersed in water.\\&quot; This ALCI may be a good concept but it turns out that if you move the dryer back and forth too quickly, its hair trigger mechanism senses catastrophe, shuts down and stays that way for who knows how long. The next day it&#x27;ll work again until mere movement back and forth make it inoperable. I never dropped it, immersed it nor did I bump my head with it while drying.    If you turn it on carefully and just hold it in one still position while moving only your head around, you can keep it going but this is not the way I dry my hair and this is not a recommendable hair dryer because of its over-sensitivity to normal hand movement.    Also, it is EXTREMELY &amp; ALMOST PAINFULLY NOISY.</li>
    <li> I have read many of the reviews for this blow dryer and there seems to be some issues with longevity. I can&#x27;t comment on that yet because I don&#x27;t use it very often and have only had it for a couple of months. Other than that, it works well, mounted to the wall without any problems (you need to be use drywall anchors and screws), and looks nice. No complaints.</li>
    <li> It does not heat as well as I think it should, barely adequate and would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer 2 months ago, and even with light use, it has now quit working. Don&#x27;t buy this - it&#x27;s junk.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and my wife loves it.The order was shipped quick and no trouble with payment.Thanks to Amazon it arrive on time for Christmas</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a 10 year old version of the same hairdryer.  The new unit is almost an exact replacement and we hope for the same long term performance.  Product shipped promptly and it fully meets our expectations.</li>
    <li> This is the third Andis hang-up dryer I&#x27;ve had.  The first two were great--worked for years.  I bought this one on June 10, 2011.  It lasted until September 8, 2011. It&#x27;s too late to return it now of course.  So I&#x27;m out the money and out of a hair dryer.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> My wife described what she wanted. Found what she wanted at Amazon. It was an easy install and we&#x27;re both happy!</li>
    <li> I love the wall mount hair dryer because it keeps by bathroom sink counter clutter free.  The unit is compact and neat looking.  It is the second one I have owned.  I liked the first one better because it had brass trim.  That unit lasted almost ten years.  I would highly recommend the purchase of this Turbo product!</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer, nice looking, powerful and easy to use.  However, the mounting system is really bad.  Once mounted, no easy way to take it down.  When this puppy needs replacing you are going to do some serious damage to the dryer itself (which would be ok if you are throwing it out anyway) or possibly to the wall around the edges of the mounting system. It needs to be more readily removable for home users.  I suppose hotels and such would suffer theft if it was really easy, so makes sense for them, but for home use it is just a hassle.</li>
    <li> Used this brand hair dryer at a hotel abd knew I wanted one. I got the wall mounted model and it is great. I might get another one for my upstairs bathroom.</li>
    <li> I have been using wall-mounted hair dryers in hotels for years and always threatened to purchase one.  When I found this one I was pleased with the price, the wattage and the apparent look of it. When it arrived - I was very pleased with how easy it was to mount on the wall in my rather small bathroom.  I don&#x27;t need a hair dryer for styling, just simple use each morning.  Seems to be working just fine and meets my needs.</li>
    <li> This is the second wall mount hair dryer I&#x27;ve purchased, the first one just died of old age. I much prefer the wall mount to the hand held; it saves me the trouble of plugging and unplugging and bathroom looks neater.  It gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I love the look of this Wall Mount Hair Dryer on my bathroom.   It is simple design, clean but powerful dryer.   I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Whenever I buy a house i always install one of these in the master bathroom.  This is my 3rd one.  Very convenient, very strong, very hot,</li>
    <li> This is the third Andis Hangup Hairdryer I have bought and the problem is the same in each one, the switch!  I just bought this last  one less than a month ago and the on/off switch is already giving me trouble. This will definitely be the last one regardless of its convenience.</li>
    <li> This is a great unit. It hangs easily on the wall, keeps the clutter of the top of my vanity and works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste another minute of your life looking at this piece of junk.  I am VERY disappointed.      First, the wall-mount...these screw anchors are the largest I&#x27;ve used on such a small device.  My last mounted hair dry used pilot holes almost half the size.  My son&#x27;s book shelves used smaller holes than these things!  Then, once you get these beasts into the wall, the unit mounts onto the mounting plate with a single turn screw.  So the white plastic unit still wiggles every time you use the hair dryer!     Second, this thing only runs for 15 seconds before overheating (yes, I timed it)!  Sure, you could turn it down so the heating coils are off, and the fan still in high, but what&#x27;s the point?    My wife, with shoulder length hair, refuses to use it because it turns off so quickly.  Do your self a favor and look somewhere else!</li>
    <li> I installed the first one 7 months ago. Worked fine for 6 months, then stopped working. Both the fan and heating coil were not operational. Took it apart and used my multimeter to see whether I could find out where was the problem. Not the GFCI, not the switch. The heating coil was still intact. No easy work around. My daughter likes this dryer. I bought another unit from Amazon. The new one made clicking noise when I was installing it. Took it apart and saw a piece of white plastic inside. It was not broken off from the dryer itself. Seem to be a random piece included as \\&quot;bonus for returning customer\\&quot;. Will see how long this second one last. It is not likely I&#x27;ll bought the third one.</li>
    <li> On the 2nd one of these and just love it.  The first one lasted for about 10 years.  So easy to use and keeps your bathroom counter clear of items just getting in the way.  I mounted mine on the wall over the power outlet near the sink.  Makes hair drying easy and is just what you need to help you get going in the morning after a shower.  I like the way it mounts and is so easy to use, you will just love it once you get one for yourself.</li>
    <li> Dryer arrived with problems with the ground fault interrupter.  Amazon shipped a replacement quickly and gave me 30 days to return the dead one.  Amazon supplied a shipping label and paid for the shipping.</li>
    <li> My husband and I recently used this model of hair dryer at a hotel while on vacation.  We like it so much, I did an internet search for it when we got home.  Purchased it on Amazon because I trust the site and know that there would be no problem if we were unhappy for any reason with the product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This dryer is quick to dry, yet not as noisey as other hair dryers. &lt;br /&gt;The hang up feature is a bonus that I could no longer live without. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A great product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for each upstairs bathroom. The arrived quickly and at first glance, I was intimidated about installation. Then after reading the instructions, and seeing that they actually include a paper guide, you just tape to your wall and drill holes where the dots are... I installed both of these completely by myself! (I am a stay at home mom, so that IS a big deal!) It took no time and they both were up! They brace very solid against the wall. The dryer worked quite well and was very quiet compared to our old dryer. It also has automatic shut off, you can even hang it up while it is on and it will shut off as it is put back into the cradle. VERY NICE! I would buy again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I needed a dryer that was easily accessible to dry my childrens&#x27; hair after bath time.  My only complaint is that the cord isn&#x27;t longer.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great dryer for the money - will see how long it lasts with three little girls in the house...</li>
    <li> This was bought to replace the same unit that had mysteriously stopped working after several years of heavy use. Obviously we like the performance and convienience of a wall mounted blow dryer. Nothing fancy, but handy.</li>
    <li> After using the hair dryer for 8 days at a hotel in Vancouver BC, I had to buy it. It wasn&#x27;t sold in Canada so I had to go through Amazon. My hair came out very smooth and it dried quickly. Yes, the noise is quite loud.  My only comment is that my husband had a hard time mounting it to our wall. I know a few customers here wrote it was easy but we had to use our fist as a &lt;hammer&gt; to really push it in. The product looks great in our bathroom, just like in a hotel&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> had this for at least 4 years and it is convenient and works well</li>
    <li> 5 stars for convenience.  However, 2 stars for quality.    My wife loves this hair-dryer.  It kept the clutter in her bathroom to a minimum.  However, this morning she told me that the thing is broken (electrical/heating element short?).  We got this in May 2007.  She used it once to twice daily.  Having said all this, I will still buy another one.</li>
    <li> I picked this model because it didn&#x27;t have the goofy nightlight and it is the same one they have installed at the local healthclub.  The quality seems on par with ones I&#x27;ve used in hotels, but it is loud on the highest setting.  My wife thought it had too much force with the nozzle on the front but you can take it off with a quarter turn.  Comes with those standard plastic inserts for drywall, but I used they kind that look like a big spiral that you twist right into the drwyall with a screwdriver.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to mount with the included template or just use the metal backplate to mark the wall.  Shipped in a no-frills plain brown box, so I would imagine that it is marketed to hotels and installers that order them in bulk.</li>
    <li> This product makes it so easy to dry my hair. I do not have to dig in my cabinet to find my hairdryer. It drys your hair very quickly. I also found it quieter than I expected. Great product. It was very easy to hang up. The directions were very clear.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  Excellent service. &lt;br /&gt;This seller is at the top of my list.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a sturdy, well-priced and reasonably attractive wall-mount hair drier I&#x27;m not aware of any better choices on the market. Other reviewers have reviewed its key features, so I won&#x27;t repeat those here.    Simply be aware that the product definitely has a limited lifetime. This is the fourth very similar product in the Andis line I&#x27;ve owned. With at most two uses a day (that&#x27;s uses, not abuses...) the life expectancy on these units has been generally about a year, and certainly no more than two. Electrical faults (failure of the speed/heat setting switch, and in one unit a *major* blue-fire producing short where the coiled power cord meets the dryer itself) have been the most common mode of failure.    Having previously installed the mounting bracket on the wall, however, switching-out the defective dryer for a replacement is a relatively simple process.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009XH6WS Andis 33295 Hangup Pro Turbo 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]  Motor would not start. Thus returned.This is my 3rd Andis as I love wall mount type in my bathrooms. Previous 2 did not last very long. Found there are other brands and therefore, changing.</li>
    <li> I have had four of these wall mounted hair dryers and love them, they are up and out of the way and stay pretty much un-noticable  No fiddling with on off buttons and looking for a place to store it.  If one leaves the on switch ON and hangs it up, it goes off and returns to the blowing setting as soon as one lifts it again. This is great. on a scale of 1-10 This item scores 11.</li>
    <li> Easy to mount on the wall.  That helps to free up counter space.  It drys very well and isn&#x27;t too noisey. However the \\&quot;over heating\\&quot; sensor in the hand held part is overly active.  When drying my hair if I hold it close to my head it will shut off and you have to wait for it to cool down before it will let you reset it.</li>
    <li> my wife and I have used this product for at least 10 years every day and it finally wore out so I had to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these and it lasted 1 month. Great customer service sent me another and now three months later the same thing happened. The low speed switch burns out. Unfortunately this time Amazon bails out and makes you deal direct with the manufacturer for return.  I&#x27;m going to Conair.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and handy.</li>
    <li> this model has a plug in verses other models that need to be hard wired. Keeps the bathroom coubter uncluttered and has plenty of power without be too hot.</li>
    <li> I am buying my second Andis wall mount hair dryer and wanted to say that the one I have has certainly done well with daily use since February 2nd, 1999--almost ten years ago. When it quit it quit, though--just stopped and never worked again. So, I finished my hair with another dryer and thought about how much nicer it is to have one on the wall!    Another reviewer commented on the difficulty of removing it from the wall mount plate. On mine there is a plastic screw type device under the dryer that holds the plastic housing firmly to the metal wall mount. That screw is very easy to turn and remove. If you don&#x27;t see that you would have problems. If you buy a replacement to match the original, you can use the same wall mount.      Any extra cord after it is plugged in, wraps inside the plastic casing. So, if you have an electrical outlet close to the dryer, it looks as though it is hard-wired because no cord is showing. I didn&#x27;t find any hard-wired versions when I bought mine, so I had a two receptacle outlet placed close, just for that purpose. It has been handy to have it.     I was very happy with this dryer and am anxious to get a new one and get going on another ten years with it!</li>
    <li> I owned this unit for 8 years before it finally died. As noted by others, the ultimate cause of its demise was a short where the power cord meets the dryer. I just purchased a replacement - I like the dryer a lot, and $40 is not bad at all for 8 years of use! I use a hair dryer every day, and it&#x27;s nice to have it mounted on the wall instead of sitting on the bathroom countertop all the time. Especially with very limited counter space, it&#x27;s been a lifesaver.  Updated review 11/21/11 - I reduced my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars due to an issue. I tend to turn my hair dryer on and off several times during my post-shower routine. With this, I can turn it on and off 3 times. After the 3rd time I turn it off, it makes a \\&quot;ping\\&quot; sound and refuses to work. After a wait of maybe 5 minutes, it makes another ping sound and works again. That&#x27;s really inconvenient if I&#x27;m just about ready to leave, have used up my 3 on/offs, and just need to blow out my bangs real quick before I head out the door. My previous model did the same thing, but the problem didn&#x27;t develop until about 5-6 years after I bought it. This one had the problem right off the bat. Unfortunately, I glued it to the wall with epoxy to increase its stability, so there&#x27;s no returning it. It&#x27;s still not a bad unit, it just has a flaw. Maybe check around a bit before you buy this.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  Years ago when I bought my first one, which finally gave out after years of use, I thought it may be bigger that I wanted for a wall mount but it is ten times better than the smaller versions you find in hotels.  There are no buttons to push to get it out and back into it&#x27;s cradle.  You just lift it.  It comes on as soon as you do, then goes off when it&#x27;s back in the cradle.  You can turn it off manually also.  The power is great and the setting are in a convenient place for switching between high, warm or hot, low warm.  Also, the funnel at the end is removable so you can have a bigger air blowing area and not have to hold it out so far from your hair.  I am thinking of ordering another one in case they stop making this model when I need one again.</li>
    <li> This was great when it worked. I have a small bathroom and it was the perfect solution until it stopped working shortly after purchase. I should have returned it. I do not recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> I love the automatic on/off feature when you use the dryer.  Powerful enough for my short hair.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great power. Lasts forever.</li>
