<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good old fashioned foam rollers... These have existed for years... My daughter likes them.  Good quality!</li>
    <li> NO RIPPED FOAM! Nothing ripped foam, no flimsy plastic, great variety!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my image mind the makeup! I was Pam, in her rotting phase, from TrueBlood! BUT LOVED THOSE CURLS</li>
    <li> Great for curling hair without heat.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this makes my curls look bigger and more beautiful</li>
    <li> I bought these on Amazon because they were the best price for the number and size of the rollers. I used these when in Jr High School because of the ease of use &amp; especially the end result curls for my long hair. Of course back then I used Dippity Do to hold the curls which lasted until I washed my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;Now all I do is pre-wet my hair with a leave  in conditioner (or just water), roll and go to sleep. If the curls are still wet when I remove the rollers, keeping the curl intact, I get dressed and eat my breakfast.  After this I  use a wide toothed comb to gently comb through then spritz a little. The style will last a few days with simple touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;Tried several other types of roller but these are the only ones that gave the results I was looking for. Most importantly,  because they are foam, they rarely (if ever) get tangled in my hair.</li>
    <li> Good rollers, every size you need.</li>
    <li> I love these. Good old fashion pink foam curlers.  Ive had them for over 6 months now and they work great.  I use the green one for my daughter and she just loves this.  Sleeping with it is fine.  None of ours fall off while sleeping. They are great price, durable and you wake up with bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
    <li> It does not damage the hair and it is soft to sleep with. Great shape, good price and quality. Elaine</li>
    <li> I have worn my hair pulled back in a chignon or braided for a decade and decided I wanted curls again. I looked around for my favorite foam rollers and saw this wonderful set. There are enough rollers in it for shoulder length or a little bit longer hair (like mine). There are enough different sizes of rollers to have tight curls or loose curls. The plastic case makes it easy to travel with all your rollers. It is wonderful to see this hair product still around decades later and still working as advertised.</li>
    <li> Wife loves them and they are a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> These give me really good tight curls i want. If you have shorter hair like me (6in.) and you want a lot of curls, you&#x27;ll need to buy another pack because biggest ones will make the curls too big, but this is a really good buy, the rods are really good.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  They&#x27;r hair rollers.  I used them years ago and I&#x27;ve just gotten so tired of having to blow dry my hair every morning to style it, I wanted to stop using heat on it so often.  So these rollers are the answer.  I can actually sleep with them AND it&#x27;s comfortable.  Seller sent them very fast.  All in all I was very pleased with the transaction.</li>
    <li> they didn&#x27;t work for me because my hair is too fine or something, but they&#x27;re perfectly good foam rollers.</li>
    <li> These are the rest rollers I ever purchased. They are very easy to put on and I can sleep in them. A couple of times I lost one or two in my sleep, but I wiggle a lot so if you sleep still it wont be a problem at all.   I love that u get different sizes so I can use smaller ones on the front and bigger ones on the back.</li>
    <li> easy to use, comfortable to sleep in, gives you great and natural looking curls. was a great buy, would recommend putting them in while hair is wet and sleeping in them.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used any kind of hair rollers, so I have nothing else to compare with.  The rollers are very easy to use. Compared to other brands listed in amazon, it seems cheaper and contains many rollers in various sizes, I think.  I found one broken roller in my set, but don&#x27;t mind &#x27;cause I still have several others; it is still cheap.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the case in other brands as well, but I found the rollers leave some marks (caused by the plastic wire) in my hair. I can&#x27;t describe it so well, but you may be able to find out what I mean.</li>
    <li> Too much hastle for me, I will stick with my hair diffuser or braids for curl. They pull my hair out, maybe because it is so long idk. Very uncomfortable to sleep in and couldn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome deal and works great. My daughters like curls and because they are young, I don&#x27;t want to use curling irons. So, these curlers are a great option. They work just as they did when I was a little girl. I like that the set came with different sizes.</li>
    <li> 4 stars because I wish they&#x27;d have bigger sizes and I would like these to stay up better. They&#x27;re a little weak but I have fine hair and use these to add volume to my roots. Good product.</li>
    <li> Guaranteed delivery was true to statement. Highly satisfied.</li>
    <li> Worked great for curling my 3 yr olds hair like she wanted since I refuse to use heat on such a young child. Curls held without product all day. Only fell out with washing.</li>
    <li> (Ordered under fiance&#x27;s account) - I used to use sponge curlers all the time when I was a younger girl and loved them. These seemed to work very well, my only complaint was that they did not seem to anchor in my hair very well, and weren&#x27;t overly tight when fastened. The results were what I was looking for though, so I am happy with them.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair on my head but it is all very fine. I have tried everything to get some body into it and nothing has worked. I&#x27;ve even tried using heat. That never held up very long and I was very worried about the damage I was doing. These foam rollers work so well on my hair. I am able to get curls that last all day! The way I use them is to roll my hair up when it is still wet. I apply some finishing spray and cover it with a satin cap and sleep in it. When I wake up, I use the finishing spray again and take the rollers out. This has worked so well for me and I would definitely recommend it to others. The only downside so far is that it tends to pull small bits of hair out. I&#x27;m hoping that as I get better at this, that won&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> Just like when I was a kid. Now I have these for my two girls who love getting their hair curled! They sleep on them no problem. One is 6 (she has ASD and these don&#x27;t even bother her) and one is 5.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a friend who is visiting me in Afghanistan. There is no store where we can buy things like this for her hair and she did not like the first rollers I made her out of small plastic water pipe. I recommend these rollers.</li>
    <li> soft &amp; comfortable.  My hair is not very long and occasionally the rollers come out of my hair while I am sleeping.</li>
    <li> got here early everything was good on it i have no complaints. works great and comfortable enough to sleep in at night.</li>
    <li> This foamrollers are the best I have had. Now I have so much that it is good for my whole live.</li>
    <li> These rollers are perfect? They are just like the rollers I used when I was a kid. It is very difficult to find these decent rollers in any regular store nowadays. These are comfortable when sleeping and great when you want to achieve a really curly look for the day.</li>
    <li> They work well, but my hair has a hard time being fully dry by the time I take them out. My best friend had the same problem and her hair is way thinner than mine. Also leave kinks but I&#x27;m told these can be blow dryed out. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> Contain a large number of each size.  Do not use the smallest one that often, but it will come in handy at some point.</li>
    <li> Both of my girls have fairly long hair and for school photos and holidays we like the ends curled...however, b/c their hair is so thin, it always falls before we leave the house and my hard work is pointless leaving them w/small kinks in their hair. So I picked these up, my mom still swears by them, been using them FOREVER! I love the diff sizes as I like to make smaller curls on the top layers and bigger ones on the bottom. I didn&#x27;t have much luck at first, seemed so hard to roll and I was getting weird kinks in them ...but then a friend told me the solution.. Perm Paper!!!!!! Duh. I can&#x27;t believe I never thought of that before! You wet the hair/paper and they easily roll up in the curlers w/o making that weird kink and w/o all the hair falling out! I have them in my 7 yr olds hair right now and after just 2 hoursI checked and the curl is so cute, but I&#x27;m gonna leave them in a bit longer.  You can buy perm paper at Sallys or on Amazon for just a couple bucks ;)</li>
    <li> The package has every possible imagined size. and besides it comes with the clips to use with the rollers. Good for the prize. would recommend it</li>
    <li> These rollers are fantastic!! My hair is a little longer than shoulder length, and these produce the most beautiful curls! These are comfortable enough to sleep in at night. I wake up in the morning, take them out, spray my hair, and it looks like I spent hours on my hair! It helps me achieve that vintage look that I love so much.</li>
    <li> I had curlers just like these for a long time, but they were black and only came in two sizes. Soon, they began to deteriorate so I ordered these...they&#x27;re great! The curl lasts all day; it takes a while for my hair to go flat. What I love is that if I go two nights with the curlers in, and then wrap my hair on the third night, that next day my hair is still curly, just a little neater. I love the variety of colors and sizes!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my 91 year old mother because she says hers are bad and can&#x27;t find any.  Shipped to her and she is very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Our girls have a lot of baby fine hair that will not hold a curl (if we curl it with a curling iron and use hairspray the curl is gone before the end of day).  These rollers (I bought these to add to my old rollers from when I was a kid, they work just as well) are magic.  Our baby fine hair is curly for multiple days.  We put them in wet and sleep in them overnight.  A warning, I tried using the some of yellow rollers and her hair came out crazy curly, she said she was ready for a disco, her dad said she looked like the bride of Frankenstein (needless to say we pulled the sides back before she left for school and it looked just fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product for folks who struggle with keeping their hair curled!</li>
    <li> These were awful. I returned them</li>
    <li> I bought these because I wanted curls, but didn&#x27;t want to mess with chemicals or worrying about damaging my hair. I have very thick hair and I had trouble getting all of my hair in the roller without it falling out of place or getting tangled. I also had trouble with the clasps popping off while I was rolling my hair, resulting in knots and tangles and a bit of swearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sleeping with them in I wake up to find no curl; just a very slight wave that fell out after an hour or two. It&#x27;s probably mostly due to my stubborn hair, but I was disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Its the cheap old school curlers, it is as it looks, you get what you pay for, nothing negative to say...</li>
    <li> They are too small to work in long hair.  And the  rods that are inserted into the sponge come out when you unroll the hair.  Very disappointing.  Too much trouble to send this back.  Left hair a frizzy mess.  Throwing out.</li>
    <li> I have used these curlers for years and it makes hair very soft and is easy to sleep in.  Also if you put them in early in the morning and every hour use a hair dryer on them for a short time your hair&#x27;s curl will last all evening and part of the next day.  Even stubborn hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American with 4b hair, natural but keratin treated.  I started using these rollers a week ago and my hair became so dry.  I put on coconut oil, mango butter, and Marguerite&#x27;s Magic by Carol&#x27;s daughter.  My hair would be greasy but so dry.  I had a lot of breakage at the ends.  I just cut inches off my hair so it wasn&#x27;t old damaged ends that were breaking but rather the middle of my hair that should have been strong.  I searched online about sponge rollers and found out that they are known for drying hair.  Think about it-- you are wrapping your hair around a sponge and leaving it overnight.  The sponge is going to absorb all the moisture.  There were several strands of hair about 1-3 centimeters long left in the foam when I took the rollers out in the morning.  I should have stopped using them when I saw this but I didn&#x27;t because I really liked the curl.  The night I finally stopped using them, my hair instantly felt better the next morning though it was still breaking.  My ends were looking so good after I cut my hair and after using these rollers for a week I have several new split ends and they look frayed.  I&#x27;m so sad.  I&#x27;ll have to get another half-inch taken off.  Its not worth it.  I&#x27;ll try hard rollers instead.  Update-- I came up with a great solution.  I washed the rollers and wrapped them with duct tape.  My hair was soft and moist the next morning and there was no hair breakage in the foam since the foam was covered!  Now I give these rollers 4 stars instead of 1.  2/10/11 Update  Wow, these rollers really wreaked havoc on my hair which I realize even more now after not using them for about 4 days.  I don&#x27;t have any breakage anymore (maybe 3-4 strands) but nothing like the 30 or so strands I had with the sponge rollers each morning.  I am now using Diane magnetic rollers, which are hard plastic rollers.  I thought they would be uncomfortable to sleep in but they weren&#x27;t and I&#x27;m a light sleeper!  I tried wrapping duct tape around the spongerollers and though it helped my hair stay moist, over time they became constricted in the middle and no longer expanded and I didn&#x27;t get good curls.</li>
    <li> This work well, but can get a little tangled in your hair, so don&#x27;t try to use too much hair at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it was a lot more effective than I thought it would, so experiment with these a bit. I suggest starting out bigger than you think you would need.</li>
    <li> Some are broken after the first usage. They work Ok but probably they won&#x27;t last long. The price is good though.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for these rollers in local store and could not find packages that contained more than 10-12 rollers.  This package has worked well for me. Although our granddaughters fight over who gets to use the yellow and blue rollers.  Their hair is super straight and those are the ones that give them the most curls.  Quality is lacking but for no more often than I use them they work fine and the price was ok.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a lot smaller than anticipated, and I can hardly get enough hair curled with them. It was a struggle.</li>
    <li> Hair rollers. Although many women prefer to use curling irons (i did too) but decided to change what I do with my hair.</li>
    <li> I had purchased other, similar curlers 3 months ago, and they are now in the garbage! These Conair rollers are soft, roll easily  and are comfortable. They leave your hair style exactly as you like it with no frizz or pulling.</li>
    <li> I watched quite a few youtube tutorials that used these and they looked way easy so I figured I would try them. I have chin length hair and am growing my hair out(from a pixie cut); So I am trying to avoid using heat on my hair. And I happen to be really lazy and don&#x27;t like to spend lots of time on my hair in the morning. These work fantastic! Although the first few times I put them in it took a while, but after a week of practice it takes me like 10 minutes to put them in. I shower in the evening, wait for my hair to dry out a bit. I put these in while my hair is still damp and then I put a scarf on my head (this does 2 things keeps them all from falling out and keeps the frizz under control) and then go to bed. In the morning I spend like 5 minutes on my hair. I take them out, play with the curls a bit, add some hairspray and a headband and I am good to go! I am also a college student so this product is awesome because I can sleep a bit longer and spend 5 minutes on my hair that looks like it took me 25 minutes! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I thought they were bigger than actual</li>
    <li> I like the variety and how sturdy the curlers are. I don&#x27;t recommend winding your hair too tightly around them, because they do go flat in the middle.</li>
    <li> Every little girl with long hair needs to sleep in pink foam rollers at least once, it is a rite of passage.  I remember sleeping in curlers more often than not when I was in elementary school.  My 3 year old loves having curly hair in the morning and they don&#x27;t seem to impact her ability to sleep comfortably.  The fact that they are pink (or at least some of them) is an added bonus!</li>
    <li> I wanted some curlers, and decided to go with a big multi-pack in hopes that there would be enough. I have thick, hip-length hair, and it doesn&#x27;t like to cooperate very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more than enough curlers in this set for even my hair, fortunately. I find that the blue and yellow are harder to unsnap to put in or take out, and more prone to come apart while you&#x27;re using them. The pink and green unfasten quite easily and stay together well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep curls in my hair all day, I start with the blue at the base of my head, and this gets up to just past my ears. I then use up the yellow, and finally most of the green. Due to the length of my hair, I have to go in very small sections, which takes a LOT of curlers! They&#x27;re comfy to sleep on, as long as you don&#x27;t position them oddly. I have very tight spirals when I first take them out, though they soften up throughout the day, giving me big, bouncy curls after a few hours, and soft waves by the end of the day. Better than using a curling iron - by the time I get to the other side of my head with one, the other side is straight again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Garnier Fructis frizz serum (the clear stuff) when putting the rollers in - I just rub a dab into each section of wet hair before curling - and again when I take them out to control any frizz that popped up over night, or that wants to surface through the day. I don&#x27;t use gel, hairspray, etc. because they don&#x27;t really make a difference, so I just target the front of my head with the serum, fluff a bit more through the curls, throw on a headband to keep it all from flopping forward into my face like it wants to, and go. I end up with shiny, bouncy curls when doing this.</li>
    <li> I really love these. I used to curl my hair in the morning with a curling iron, but I really think that overnight curls suit me better because I am NOT a morning person at ALL. So I bought these...well, first I bought individual packs of the pink and green ones (sold separately, obviously) and then I bought this because I wanted to mess around with the other two sizes (the yellow and blue). These don&#x27;t take a long time to get the hang of and are easy to use. It does feel a little funny sleeping on them, but I didn&#x27;t have any problems sleeping and it really didn&#x27;t notice any discomfort. It just felt odd, that&#x27;s all. When you take them out, even the large size gives you little ringlets that fall into a nice big curl throughout the course of the day - I end up brushing my hair a little to speed this process because I usually have to go right out the door. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use in my daughter&#x27;s hair instead of trying a hot curling iron on a wiggly little girl, and they work great!  Amazon was much more convenient than going to the store too!</li>
    <li> Although it comes with 48 rollers there aren&#x27;t enough of one size to cover the whole head if you want all the same sized curls. I ordered 2 packs and that worked well to cover my head with all the largest size rollers since I have very long hair, although the largest size were quite a bit smaller than I was picturing.&lt;br /&gt;I put them in my damp hair and slept on them and when i took them out in the morning i looked disastrous and like a poodle and had to brush them out/wet them down, and pin them back but by the evening when i let my hair out they were nice loose curls. I would suggest putting them in dry hair so the curl isn&#x27;t so crazy and making sure the ends aren&#x27;t bent by the rest of your hair cause it can create kinks. One last tip is make sure there all secured right to the head because if they hang a bit loose there&#x27;s barely a wave and it just looks bad. seems like a product you just need to get a handle on and test out a few times. a bit difficult to fall asleep with though but its better than damaging your hair with heat!</li>
    <li> I ended up using the medium curlers because the large one ran out.</li>
    <li> As described and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I have really straight hair so it&#x27;s really hard for me to find something that can curl my hair and have it last. I&#x27;ve tried curling irons with tons of hairspray and velcro rollers don&#x27;t work very well either. it&#x27;s uncomfortable to sleep in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Well, this works wonders! Seriously, my curls lasted for 2 days without hairspray(probably more if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair). Really happy with this.</li>
    <li> These are useless.  I followed the directions and they were in my hair for hours, but the curl they left lasted more like minutes.  A lot to spend for a single (unsuccessful) use.</li>
    <li> I like the different sizes, great for layered hair and different size curls or waves I feel like wearing and gives my hair a break from all the hot tools I use on my hair</li>
    <li> I bought these because my daughter is always wanting her hair to be curled, but there is no time for that in the morning before school.  I set her hair the night before and the curls were well-formed in the morning.  She said they didn&#x27;t bother her sleep.  As she has quite a lot of hair, I bought a second set to have more of the larger rollers.</li>
    <li> Buying these brought me back to my childhood.  They have worked great for my daughter and I!  Thank you!  :)</li>
    <li> We bought these for our 7 year old for Christmas and so far, they&#x27;ve been great. The sponges have maintained their shape and they are easy to clip and unclip.</li>
    <li> Just gross covered in nasty hair and dandruff and no where did it say used. Hair products I thought was a Vinnie that they came new not covered in some one else&#x27;s dna. YUCK returning immediately and buyer be wear for sure!!!</li>
    <li> These are great curlers as far as staying in your hair over night and they do give your hair a bit of a curl and bounce depending on the length and thickness of your hair. Mine is very long (Past my waist long) and semi thick, so I think I will need to order the bigger curlers to go with these just because my hair was not completely dry the next morning when I took them out and still had to use blow dryer and curling iron on some curls to just get ready for Church. They are, however, quite easy to sleep on and not so very uncomfortable. Besides, I remember these from when my mother used to curl my hair many years ago. They do bring back memories. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Theses rollers worked really well with my hair. Keep in mind that I have a short pixie cut and pretty thick hair, my sister also tried them out and they worked well for her too! She has shoulder length hair and it&#x27;s pretty thin.</li>
    <li> I used to sleep in these a ton when I was a little girl, and as an adult I was looking for an easier way to curl my hair without the effort and heat of curling irons and curlers. So, I decided to find out if these timeless foam curlers would still be just as awesome as when I was six, and I was not disappointed. These are comfortable enough  to sleep in and they really curl your hair. In fact, the first time I used them, I forgot how well they worked and boy did I have curls! It wasn&#x27;t the look I was going for, but I have since adjusted how long I wear them and how I out them in. These are great!</li>
    <li> A little hard to put in and take out. But after much practice I got the hang of its leaves u with the most stunning curls.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. 10-year old granddaughter loves the many colors and gets a quick out of how she looks with them. So funny.</li>
    <li> They work well and they are as described. Came very quickly and packaged well. I used them last night and they do a great job. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Not liking this product at all. I really have difficulty with it, putting it in and out. Plus it really is time consuming.</li>
    <li> Easy to put in your hair, find no trouble sleeping in them. Only downside is I find it hard to keep them organized and pulls out some of my hair on occasion.  But great for large curls and Shirley temple curls.</li>
    <li> Love these! No more heat damage to my hair and I achieve the same results that I do with a curling iron.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased these curlers at Wal-Mart a few months ago, I was looking for my hair to produce movie star-like curls, and these ones did just great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam curlers also gave my hair lots of volume and shine!</li>
    <li> I have tried all the top rated rollers on Amazon and these are my favorite. I am terrible with hair and everything has to be very simple or I just don&#x27;t use it. I have lots of unused hair stuff. These rollers are easy to use, does not get trapped in my hair are comfortable enough to sleep in.</li>
    <li> My hair is stick straight. recently the car broke down and I had lots of home time. I discovered these curlers on Amazon that had been part of my past groming. I wonder of these curlers is the end result. I was able to create an afro look, a flip look, ready for business look, free spirit, ect. friends started commenting and I got to enjoy the encouragement. Do not know what my hairdresser will have to say.</li>
    <li> If you go to any store  you will see that the price is double for smaller amount of Conair rollers.. great buy, worth every penny</li>
    <li> I am enjoying these very much, they are perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the bigger curlers in the pack. She has no use for the smaller ones. Five stars if you could buy the bigger ones only.</li>
    <li> My daughters love to put curlers in there hair and these work great they go to bed and in the morning there hair is very curly.</li>
    <li> Thank you for exactly date</li>
    <li> I like these. The only thing is I wish there were more &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; ones in this pack as it&#x27;s the only ones I use. They are about 1.5&amp;#34; and the green are 1&amp;#34; and the yellow ate .5&amp;#34; and blue are maybe 1/4&amp;#34; or so. If I could just buy a pack of pink, I would.</li>
    <li> These curlers work very well but only if your hair is damp when you put them in or if you straighten your hair and put them in while your hair is still hot. Otherwise nothing will happen and your hair won&#x27;t curl at all.</li>
    <li> Used when my hair had already air dried for 20 min. Left these rollers in for 1 hour, still wet. Too time consuming.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t stay in when my hair is wet. Pointless.</li>
    <li> These are really easy to use for someone that has never used them before. There are super comfortable and for the price, they are just what I expected....not the best quality but good enough!</li>
    <li> My daughter needed ringlet curls for a stage production she was in.  We put these in mid-morning and by evening she had perfect ringlets that lasted for hours-even on stage with hot lights and even wearing a hat over them for half of the show.  We had to leave them in for at least 3 hours, longer is better.</li>
    <li> Nice set of the foam rollers. Just like they were back in the day. This is a nice, versatile assortment for a reasonable low price.</li>
    <li> I only tried to use these one time. I think they will be ok, but i need to let my hair dry completly. I took them out to soon. I also need to work with them more to get the look I want.</li>
    <li> Are not as expected, dd not curl hair very well!</li>
    <li> For the value these foam rollers work great.  Full head of cures when you wake up after using them through the night.</li>
    <li> I paid $3.82 for these, and I obviously got a great deal. I had no clue how much these things cost, so when I saw these at my local store I was surprised to see them for $10. They arrived quickly and I&#x27;ve used them on my daughter&#x27;s hair once, at Halloween. They worked great! Her curls turned out much smaller that I intended (like ringlets) but it looked beautiful. I really like the plastic zipper container they come in for storage. I also figured out why both ends pop off... when removing the curlers, it really helps prevent the hair from getting tangled around the clip.</li>
    <li> I have only used the big pink ones, but they work great.  I put them on when my hair is damp and leave them on until it&#x27;s dry.  The curls last for days.</li>
    <li> I loved these rollers. They have a bunch of sizes so you can vary the size of your curls and they&#x27;re super comfortable to sleep in. The only con was that the fasteners were snapping off as I was trying to roll my hair on some of them, but I just snapped them back on and they were good to go. For the price, I&#x27;d buy these again.</li>
    <li> These work great. I have really thick hair and I have been using these for about a year now. I started out with extra short hair and now have medium length hair. They are way easy to put in and are soo comfortable to sleep on. I use a silk bonnet to keep them in place and to cut down on the frizz.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT.  Comfortable to wear at night.  Lots of size options.  Nice case to hold them in.  Makes wonderful curls.  I love this product.  So does my pre-teen daughter.  Highly recommend.  We have tried other products for curling hair overnight and this is the best product out there.</li>
    <li> The clasps don&#x27;t even hold.  You can&#x27;t roll your hair and then keep the clasp on long enough to clip it tight.  Worthless.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> flimsy ..... hard to use as the the locking part of the curler keeps coming unsnapped from the center spindle of the curler. that requires that you either stop what you&#x27;re doing and try to push the arm of the curler back into the spindle, or remove the curler entirely, put the arm back, then attempt to replace the curler in your hair.  The other problem is trying to get the curler tight enough to stay in place without unrolling a turn and a half before stopping.  all in all, these may be good for children, or elderly people with thin hair and probably the best when you have someone else around to curl your hair for you.  If shipping and handling wouldn&#x27;t cost as much as the item to return these, i would. Going into the donation pile.</li>
    <li> Sturdy rollers. Clasp works ok but could be much more stronger. But I like them so they are a keeper.</li>
    <li> I am a novice to hair rollers but I absolutely love curls and was looking for a no heat way to get them when I wanted them. I have long thick hair so I knew I would have to sleep in them. Its  never really  comfortable to sleep with things on your head but I managed eventually. I did have curls in the morning. Not exactly the tight spirals I hoped for but there were curls with no heat or chemicals!</li>
    <li> Love these foam rollers, I remember them from the 80&#x27;s. I can do up my hair at night, sleep on them, take them out, brush and go. I don&#x27;t like fussing with my hair. I just want some nice curl, without waiting for a perm to grow out to the &#x27;right&#x27; amount of curl. Rollers I can do myself. Wish the foam would retain its shape better. For the money, its a steal (I got them for $3.82 add on item)</li>
    <li> Great for putting curls in your hair.  I do not like using the curling iron because it does not get the curls up tight by my head.  They are soft and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> These are a Christmas gift for my daughter. They come in a nice little case to keep them in. They are exactly what she wanted so she can sleep in them. These are the same kind I had many years ago and kind of hard to find. Especially in a different sizes all together.</li>
    <li> great buy-  easy to use- lots of sizes-  good gift for seniors &amp; younger girls- easy to seep in-nice zip re pack bx-</li>
    <li> These were super cheap to buy, but they were also made out of cheap material. If you sleep on them your hair will get tangled. However, I did like the variety of sizes that came in this pack and the carrying case is convenient.</li>
    <li> I try to avoid heat appliances on my hair, and these are a great way to do it.  I brought these on a vacation to Italy where I didn&#x27;t want to be bothered with an adapter and a converter, and these rollers did a great job.  I have short, chin length hair, and have used a variety of size combos for a great wavy or curly effect.  I find setting hair in foam rollers, overnight, allows for a sturdier, longer lasting curl.  They stay put overnight, are fine to sleep in.</li>
    <li> These rollers worked fine.  I just placed some silk fabric over them so that they don&#x27;t break my hair.</li>
    <li> variety of sizes works wonders when wanting to curl different!!!! love it!</li>
    <li> A couple of them broke the first time I used them. They are probably fine, but don&#x27;t work for the length and thickness of my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like them they don&#x27;t work. I tried keeping them in for a night and they didn&#x27;t curl my hair.</li>
    <li> Great (sleep on) curlers. Nice strong clasps. I ordered another pkg. These a easier to use than most. Try them, you will like them.</li>
    <li> I am Lance&#x27;s wife and am enjoying using these rollers.  They are so much more comfortable to sleep in than my old plastic ones.  (I still use some of those on top of my head but the con air are great for the back of my head when sleeping!). Maryalyce Johnsen</li>
    <li> I bought these after reading the raving reviews, but was sorely disappointed! Putting them in was easy enough, but when I went to take them out, every one was tangled and I had to rip my hair out just to remove them! My hair type is long (mid back), pin straight no matter what I do, and average thickness.  Of course, Amazon customer support was more than helpful; issuing me a refund immediately with no problem.  These rollers might work for some, but not for me! I guess my hair was meant to be permanently straight.</li>
    <li> These are the best rollers to sleep in. More comfortable than any others I&#x27;ve tried. Great sizes, and plenty to do even my thick head of hair!</li>
    <li> I used these when I was younger and loved them. But they will work differently for everyone depending on the hair type. It may even work differently for me since I used them last. My hair is super hard to curl  now and it wasn&#x27;t when I was younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I had when I was younger was the foam will eventually break down so you can not wrap the hair too tight around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to trying these out tonight to see if they still work as well as they did when I was little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped very fast. Delivered on January 2nd instead of the estimated Jan 4.</li>
    <li> I have a 12 year old granddaughter that will in fact love these rollers, the colors are really nice for her age group... The rainbow is always nice..</li>
    <li> For the price I thought I would give these a shot. Terrible decision. I don&#x27;t know if I wrapped my hair around them too tightly or just maybe don&#x27;t have the right type of hair but when I took these out after leaving them in overnight, my hair was a frizzy mess and I ended up having to wash it out before leaving the house. Tried it again the next night, wrapping them looser this time and they hardly would stay in long enough for the curls to form.</li>
    <li> Good foam rollers!! Easy to use. Very comfortable But all the sizes are tiny... Even the large pink rollers are not big. The blue color are Like the size of perm rollers...</li>
    <li> My little girl has very thin yet frizzy wavy hair. So we got this for her to see if we could put them in her hair while wet and have her wake up with a nice polished look. They worked well but only the larger ones. The little ones are a little too little for nice curls. They turn out more like friz. Having said that as long as I stick to the larger curls my 8 year old loves it.</li>
    <li> Wow! Lots of little curls everywhere but you must roll hair properly into this little rollers or you wind up with funny kinks.</li>
    <li> These left my hair frizzy and awkwardly crimped in some spots.</li>
    <li> have not used yet.. letting my hair grow out. nice quality... just as i remembered.  very fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great for a quick-fix curl.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair. Even on my wedding day, with extensions, my hair was flat within an hour. I have tried curling irons and they never provide lasting results either. I tried these and they worked! Sure, the curls were flat in 4 hours, but that is longer than I have ever gotten. They made my hair super frizzy. I washed my hair at night, waited until it was 75% dry, rolled it up, and slept with them in.</li>
    <li> The first time I used these, I didn&#x27;t use any hair products, just put them in after a shower and slept in them. When I took them out, I got the cutest curls - that were flat in about 3 minutes. I use mousse now and curl them up and they stay ok. They take a while to put in your hair if your hair is thick (30 minutes about) but nice for something that won&#x27;t damage your hair. It was a little hard for me to sleep in them at first but I got used to it, they are pretty soft.</li>
    <li> dont get the cheaper version&lt;br /&gt;these work great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or better yet, slightly dampen hair after wash leave some conditioner in and use some fructose glossing stuff, section hair, loosly twist, then pin curl and boby pin&lt;br /&gt;much more comfy to sleep in</li>
    <li> There are plenty empty curlers even for long hair. The only thing I found was the difficulty in snapping them after rolling your hair. But if your looking for curls this product is for you. I overslept while I had them on.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for your money. I am able to use this product for different styles for my hair.</li>
    <li> These are awfully small, but I got my hair cut very short and wanted to be able to curl it if I wanted. The rollers are comfy. Just don&#x27;t leave them in too long!</li>
    <li> These rollers work as advertised, although, in hindsight, I will not leave them in overnight.  Comfortable enough as they were, they just gave way too much curl for my hair, even with the large rollers.  The curls were nice and it did take a little time for them to fall out, I just was not a fan of them.  I did find that 12 same-size rollers are not enough for me, but I have really thick hair that reaches almost to my hips (the kind that needs to be thinned whenever I go in for a trim).  My only complaint is the tendency of the locking clips to completely disconnect from the roller, so I have a roller in one hand, and the plastic lock bar in the other.  Not a fan of having to unroll the hair, reattach the plastic, and then roll back up.</li>
    <li> These are okay once you get how to roll your hair without the roller slipping and you hair slipping off.  I may just be awkward though lol.  They do the job though it just takes me forever to get the darn things in my hair properly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this pack. I wanted to try curling my hair without using a curling iron, but I wasn&#x27;t sure what size to get, so I got this pack with all the sizes. I found out that for my personal style I only go with the two larger sizes, so next time I&#x27;ll just order those. I love these foam rollers, and sleep with them all night for curls and, later in the day, waves that don&#x27;t require heat.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my natural hair to do a roller set. Felt like I needed a ton of rollers for a good price. Bought these and the variety in the sizes really helped me finish my hair off and it made it look stunning as well. I love that these rollers don&#x27;t break that easily and there&#x27;s a lot of them and the bounce back which makes them last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> The rollers worked well, but if you have really long hair it wont snap shut. I have to use 2 rollers per bunch of hair. The case it comes in is handy. I would have given it 5 stars, but the rollers keep snapping off of my head or I have to use double the amount. My hair is down to my waist, but is pretty thin.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase thsese again. While beong used they fell aprty right in my hands</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know quite what I was expecting, but I have used them several times and I am not happy with the results. Unsure whether that is because of my hair -- I have thin,fine, shoulder-length hair -- or the product. The pink ones are too big and fall out within seconds, the green ones are good though, but there are not enough. Was very good for volume though :)</li>
    <li> Amazing. It came in the mail today and it looked better than the picture. The colors are deep and vibrant. The only thing is the smaller the roller, the harder it is to click on. But it&#x27;s worth the effort. I have beautiful curls in my hair.</li>
    <li> Neither good or bad, I guess I just haven&#x27;t found a way to use these so they are useless. I feel like if I put them on, they would fall right off.</li>
    <li> They break and fall apart very easily. You would be better off going to Sallys. These are really small and dont work good at all.</li>
    <li> too this far as material used in making these</li>
    <li> My hair kept getting caught and tangled on the rolls. They were fairly easy to put on and were comfortable to sleep in but taking them out heavily damaged my hair. I would not recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to rip their hair out.</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I bought sponge rollers.  They were sturdy, but now, the only kind I can find in any brand are these flimsy type.  They fall apart as I roll up my hair and the sponge is not sturdy either.  They compact quickly so that I have to throw them away.  Surely, SOME company must still be out there that still makes the sturdy plastic fasteners and quality sponge.  When they tried to cut costs, they created a worthless product.  DO NOT BUY THESE!  You are wasting your money &amp; they don&#x27;t care to change their quality!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to sleep in. Did the job well. I&#x27;m still learning how to use them but I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, makes nice curls, plenty of rollers for even a really full head of hair. These haven&#x27;t changed in years for a reason - they&#x27;re great as-is.</li>
    <li> they reason I did not give 5 stars was because they break to easy, I like them but I wish they would hold up a little better, other wise they would be great.</li>
    <li> These rollers were smaller than I thought and very cheaply made (especially the fasteners). I much prefer the cloth type rollers that I can sleep in all night. They are much better made than these and able to hold much more hair.</li>
    <li> I love these foam rollers. They are just like the ones I had as a young girl. I use these often and Im so glad they were in stock for me to purchase.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. They are foam so they seem to all want to shrink down when you wrap your hair around them. It seemed like a good thing to buy to sleep in, but it is rather uncomfortable to do. I still use my hot rollers and supplement with these.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and a great value!</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t hold very well, didn&#x27;t work as I would have expected.  But I don&#x27;t usually use curlers... so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> These rollers are as easy to use as I remember from the 1980&#x27;s.  The kit comes with a variety of 4 sizes which allows the user to choose the best size for shorter or longer length hair.  I am able to roll both my 6 y.o. daughter&#x27;s shoulder length thick hair and 3 y.o. daughter&#x27;s mid-back length thinner hair up with the yellow and green rollers and still have over half to spare.  My 6 y.o. has stick straight hair and the yellow rollers giver her very tight Shirley Temple style curls for the day.  My 3 y.o. has a little natural wave and a few ringlets, when I use the green rollers in her hair, she gets ringlets all over.  The best way that I&#x27;ve been able to obtain curls that last through the day is by washing hair the night before and partially towel drying and adding some mousse.  Roll hair and sleep in rollers overnight.  Remove in morning for all day curls!  Both of my girls sleep easily in these rollers and have not complained of being uncomfortable.  The only reason I dinged a star is because the foam does not spring back as easily and quickly as my set from the &#x27;80s did.  I found there were still dents in the foam 12 hours after removing the rollers.</li>
    <li> They work very well on my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. She loves waking up with curls!</li>
    <li> They do the job---would be nice if they were easier to open and close.</li>
    <li> Not very useful rollers. Hair gets caught in the foam, and the plastic handles snap out of place all the time.</li>
    <li> Not really a hair person. They are pretty easy to figure out if you know what you are doing but I never do my hair EVER so I couldn&#x27;t figure out the right way to do it so it looks right on me. If you know something about doing your own hair they they will probably work better for you.</li>
    <li> Excellent, except they seem to fall apart more than my other package of them that I got somewhere else. Just a little strange on that matter... I put them back together and use them just fine. Creates a lot of curls, or just a few wavy curls, just whatever you want. I have very long hair, to my waist and am 5&#x27;9-1/2&amp;#34; tall.. thin hair, age 62. There are a variety of ways to curl it so as to make it look like I have more hair than I do, ha.</li>
    <li> It is no fault of Conair, I just don&#x27;t look good with that tight of a curl. I like to use these so I don&#x27;t have to rush in the morning for work and they leave a really nice curl/wave. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is the fact that the two plastic peices separate really easily on it&#x27;s pivoting point. The clasp will stay shut well, but the bottom comes undone easily on the larger rollers.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but they came fast. I will use them for curling my hair. But I will probebly just end up using a curling wand.</li>
    <li> I love the wonderful assortment of rollers. The colors are fun too.</li>
    <li> My daughter saved her own money to buy these. Good thing she bought when she did as the price has since tripled but she loves the product. She&#x27;s 7 years and and will curl her hair after the bath and the curls turn out amazing. So easy a kid can do it without any specific training.</li>
    <li> I was not able to find hair rollers locally and I am happy to be able to get them online.  The only minor complaint I have is that they are a little hard to snap and unsnap.</li>
    <li> I like these foam rollers. I always use them with perm papers for smooth ends.&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have is the inside plastic stick and connected clip always slips out of the roller. I did not read of anyone else having this problem.  I might be holding it wrong or my hair is long so all the wrapping may cause it to come out easier.  I would buy all large sized pink rollers next time. My hair is too long for the blue and yellow rollers.</li>
    <li> I am a light and finicky sleeper and these curlers (for me) were horrible to sleep in. But the curlers made pretty curls.</li>
    <li> Because of the quality, I chose 2 stars. I&#x27;d probably pick 2.5 if it were an option. I have very thick, just past shoulder length hair, and it took most of the rollers to get it all up. First thing I notice is there aren&#x27;t enough large, pink rollers and the blue ones are superfluous unless you want a really tight perm-y curl. I managed to avoid using those, but did have to use quite a few yellows, and those came out looking kinda ratty and caused tangles because of the little curls being underneath and random. So, that&#x27;s not what you want. But the curls from the larger sized rollers came out very nicely, and created some nice lift. My hair has always taken and held curl well, so if your hair is more resistant to curl then maybe don&#x27;t take my word for it. The rollers also kept breaking while I was putting it up, so it took probably twice as long as it should have. I have never had that issue with even cheaper rollers in the past. So, to sum up, poor quality rollers, pretty good hair.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price.  Old fashion but does the job.... I would recommend them as you will not damage your hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been years since I purchased new rollers and this looked like the perfect pack. I expected them to be the same quality as my old \\&quot;Goody\\&quot; rollers.  Wrong!  These rulers are extremely hard to open.  Once the hair is rolled and you attempt to snap the roller closed, the back part of the closing mechanism pops out!  That means, unrolling that length of hair to remove the roller, pop the back part back in and re-roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also do not stay in the hair the way the older ones did.  I think the foam is too smooth to grip the hair. Even with the hair very damp, they keep coming unrolled. Unfortunately, I had already discarded my very old Goody rollers so will have to use these until I can find replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT buy this brand again.  They look nice but are much too flimsy.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased these Conair Foam Rollers thinking that for a cheap price they might not work that great, but it turns out they worked pretty good! I am very pleased with the results. Long lasting curls and very tight curls too &amp;lt;3 I would recommend that instead of damaging your hair with heat, buy these and you&#x27;ll have awesome heatless curls that look fabulous! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I used them in my hair over night and some curls came out brilliantly and some failed big time. It was a little bothersome.</li>
    <li> Old school and just as effective as ever</li>
    <li> I have medium-long hair, and after curling them around the curlers, the foam is so soft that they didn&#x27;t hold my hair into actual circles .. my hair didn&#x27;t get curls. It got really weird shapes that looked awful and tangled. It was easy to use, but had awful results.</li>
    <li> I actually had enough for my whole head!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughter to sleep in before her dance competitions!! I highly recommend for any dance mom who doesn&#x27;t want to curl hair</li>
    <li> there is a nice selection of sizes and these are quite comfortable to sleep on.  they work great.  I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Some of them ripped easily but gave me a very curly fro. It was beautiful. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Curlers were just ok.  Being foam I figured I could sleep in them.  I did but it was uncomfortable.  And when I took them out next morning I had an afro that I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers through much less a comb. Was a mess.  Took lots of conditioning to get hair manageable.  Believe rollers being foam absorbed all the moisture from my hair.  Don&#x27;t use for long lengths of time for this reason.</li>
    <li> These remind me of the ones I borrowed from my mom when I was a little girl.  They are comfortable, and don&#x27;t snag my hair.</li>
    <li> could not be used on wet hair</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s what it is...  Simple cheap rollers.  I found I was struggling a lot with opening and closing the clasps.  The kid was not a fan of sleeping on them.  For a single Dad such as myself, they were a lot of fun overall.  I later discovered the Snail curlers and have not touched these again.  Snail ones are sooo much easier.</li>
    <li> For my shorter, layered hair. longest length 4&amp;#34;, a styling product on the damp hair is necessary to keep the hair on the&lt;br /&gt;rollers.  Unsurprisingly, there are 48 for 4 bucks @ wallymart..</li>
    <li> these things curl your hair like nobodies business. Not terrible to sleep in, but you may have a few sore parts on your scalp where the curler pulled your hair a little while you slept. Perfect is you want small ringlets, but not so much for soft waves unless you leave them in for a really short amount of time</li>
    <li> These worked very effectively, weren&#x27;t hard to sleep on at all. Might get two sets because the small ones frizzed my hair out and it&#x27;s difficult to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> Great curlers, rec&#x27;d quickly.  I only needed the smallest and 6 of the next larger size. Anyone need some larger ones? They work fine.</li>
    <li> I love these!  I only needed about 8-10 to do my whole head and my hair is long.  I rolled them up, put on a silky sash so they would slide easily on my pillow, and woke up to the most amazing, bouncy, shiny curls that I have ever had.  Perfect for pin up girl styles.  They also hold their shape all day!</li>
    <li> I saw these at my local CVS and I was in need of rollers, so I don&#x27;t always have to use my curling iron.  My mother used them in my hair when I was younger, so I gave them another try.  I loved how they had assorted sizes, so I was optimistic.  The moment I put one in and tried to close it the back popped off.  Then they didn&#x27;t even stay in and I rolled them tight!  It is not the same as when I was a child.  I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> This product worked great. They were really simple and comfortable to sleep in. I recommend these for curly/ textured hair it make curls more defined. Also the assorted sizes are great. Initially i thought their were to many large size rollers but since it is a sponge material you can make the curls as tight as you can roll them.</li>
    <li> I offer these two apt slogans for Conair Foam Rollers, Pro Bono: \\&quot;Gambling Your Precious Time on These Idiotically-Designed Curlers Is Dangerous to Your Mental Health\\&quot; \\&quot;Set of Hair-Rollers Looks Good, Works Bad\\&quot;--Go ahead, spend time creating sections of hair and roll &#x27;em up, at which point the clasps disconnect from the rollers and you will have to start all over again. It is so frustrating that I, after owning these things for over a year and giving them another try every few months, became enraged and threw them away. Out of sight, out of mind--warning, the insane design of these pretty foam rollers may drive you out of your mind, too!</li>
    <li> Pricey for what it is and a little uncomfortable to sleep in. Wish there were more of the biggest size ones. But they do work great and give my hair awesome soft waves and curls.</li>
    <li> These come in a very compact case with 14 of the blue ones (about 1/4 inch), 12 of the yellow ones (about 1/2 inch), 10 of the green ones (maybe 7/8 of an inch) and 12 of the pink ones (1.25 to 1.5 inches. I have 3 dozen 1 inch foam rollers from another purchase and the biggest ones in this set ARE larger than an inch). The foam on these appear to be of better quality than other foam rollers I have tried, and the clasps are easy to use. I have medium-thickness hair that&#x27;s maybe halfway down my butt, and I can easily put all my hair into these with maybe a half dozen to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for foam rollers in general, they&#x27;re longer lasting and less damaging than curling wand curls or velcro/self-grip rollers and WAY easier to use and easier to sleep in than plastic rollers with clips. In my experience, any way. Some people complain of dents. However, the ones down the shaft of the hair can usually be avoided by making sure you don&#x27;t put too much hair per clip, and the ones at the top can be fixed by smoothing them with a brush (or straightener/other heat tool for faster results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProTip: I was having trouble with my other set of foam rollers of getting the hair to dry, it is WAY faster to roll all your hair up, then spray with a spray bottle. You may be thinking that the hair won&#x27;t get wet all the way through, but it WILL. The curls I got from using these that way are very tight, well-formed, long-lasting (day 3), and have taken a lot of brushing. I never put products in my hair, and I didn&#x27;t have to with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take them out and look like Shirley Temple, it&#x27;s okay, just comb with a wide tooth comb and then smooth with a boar bristle brush (I&#x27;ve found that regularly bristled brushes like paddles brushes don&#x27;t work as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For blondes: I&#x27;ve found that letting my hair dry from a wash whilst in the curls makes the color look dingy, I don&#x27;t know why. I recommend letting your hair dry, then dampening it and rolling the hair OR, my preferred method, rolling your whole head, then spraying it with a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: If you want this look, these are perfect.my preferred method, rolling your whole head, then spraying it with a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: If you want this look, these are perfect.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers for a no heat style but whoever said you can sleep in them is a liar! Worst night of life!!!  Don&#x27;t. Even try it!! Trust me!!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I needed something simple and fast to work with. I used these after getting out of the shower and even slept with them comfortably. The next morning I had tight curls that lasted me for the rest of the day. My hair&#x27;s thick, wavy and shoulder length, so if you have the same kind of hair I do, this may work out for you too.</li>
    <li> These curlers are just how I remembered them when I was a little girl. I got them for myself and my daughter. They are great. I have learned to not curl them so tight on my hair..only need to roll them about half way up. My hair is naturally wavy. My daughter&#x27;s hair is very straight, so the curls take better when I roll her hair all the way up!</li>
    <li> Item as described, exactly what I want, come it fast and package is good</li>
    <li> I remember these from when a child but I bought them from my niece&#x27;s WishList.  She is&lt;br /&gt;a &#x27;retro&#x27; girl and likes things from &#x27;back then&#x27; (ha ha).  I&#x27;m giving to her for her birthday next&lt;br /&gt;month, so  hoping she will Love Them. The pkg arrived timely and good condition and being&lt;br /&gt;new is impressive!</li>
    <li> The quality is not what it shows in listing. You can buy better in a dollar store. It was very disappointing coming from a well known company such as Conair.</li>
    <li> Work great really make my hair curly.</li>
    <li> Kinda wish there were more of the larger size and less of the smaller, but I guess a variety of curl sizes is nice. Easy to sleep in and they don&#x27;t fall out like my other ones did.</li>
    <li> Daughter uses these several times a week.  They make great curls.</li>
    <li> Just like the curlers I grew up with! Easy enough for my girls to do themselves, and the price and time effort is right! :-) They&#x27;re really thin and not as solid as I would have guessed they would be (the plastic parts, that is)--but I guess that makes them super light and more comfortable, anyways. They are great!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t hold and took over 24 hours for my hair to dry. Many broke apart after one use. I threw these away.</li>
    <li> Blisters from the polyethelene foam as well as the plyable plastic-it too is made from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I took off the rollers from the wet set, light Herbal Essence brand gel used on hair pre-roll, white blisters with red circles around them throbbed and began itching like something horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;forgive mis-spelled words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientists Needed for \\&quot;Branchworm Study\\&quot; ~ If you know of anyone that would like to help further my study of Branchworm, send me a note here, I will check weekly.&lt;br /&gt;  ***&lt;br /&gt;(below, I explain the issue of &#x27;Spider Silk&#x27; in genetically enhanced, reflects the first product being a Goat that has been ingected with the genes of a Venom Spider Type for the &#x27;Web/Silk&#x27; that will be producing a large number of a &#x27;Silk&#x27; that will come out of the Female Goat&#x27;s body during &#x27;Milking&#x27;.

I come from the medical world, but what I found out was shocking, but at least I was getting answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please place a note here if you can help or can contribute scientific assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy these foam rollers, buy the long 10\\&quot; Diane or Similar Conair Rubber Spiral rollers-they fold over...no heat needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.
