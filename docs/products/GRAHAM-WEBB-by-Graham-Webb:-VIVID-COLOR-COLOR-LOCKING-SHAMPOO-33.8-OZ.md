<li> Also, like others have said, the packaging sucks.</li>
<li> Probably at least 3 ounces had spilled.  </li>
<li> Granted, my hair is crazy unnatural mermaid red, but when compared to other shampoos, this one failed.</li>
<li> However, I was very disappointed that it had leaked out everywhere in the shipping package, even though it was wrapped in plastic.  </li>

    <li> This is one of the best &#x27;volumizing&#x27; products I&#x27;ve used even tho that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s advertised. I&#x27;m 60+ and have silver-gray hair that&#x27;s starting to thin. This shampoo plus the matching conditioner make me look like I have a full head of hair again.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much.  However, I was very disappointed that it had leaked out everywhere in the shipping package, even though it was wrapped in plastic.  It&#x27;s obvious this problem is a re-occuring one; it&#x27;s also obvious that the solution is not an acceptable one!</li>
    <li> Since I started coloring my hair I find this is a great product to keep color in and hair looking healthy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and continue to enjoy the results. I will order it again as soon as I can.</li>
    <li> When I received the box looked fine, but when I opened it, there was shampoo all over the inside.  Probably at least 3 ounces had spilled.  The top of the bottle was crushed.  It seemed to be packed well and the box didn&#x27;t look damaged, but it definitely had been crushed at some point.</li>
    <li> Vivid Color Color Locking Shampoo keeps my color looking good until the next time I color.  I have used it for years, and can only find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love the Graham Webb products</li>

    <li> I have purple highlights in my hair and those can fade very fast. This shampoo feels very luxurious on my hair and my color stays a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED OTHER SHAMPOO&#x27;S BUT THIS IS THE BEST.  I WILL ORDER AGAIN!!  I AM SO GLAD YOU HAVE IT AVAILABLE.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> The primary reason for this purpose was the product&#x27;s advertised &amp;#34;color locking&amp;#34; power... This offered no color protection. My cheap Garnier Fructis shampoo caused less color loss than this. Granted, my hair is crazy unnatural mermaid red, but when compared to other shampoos, this one failed. Also, like others have said, the packaging sucks.</li>
