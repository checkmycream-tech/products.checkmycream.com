### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are perfect for that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a GREAT find!</li>
      <li>I ordered these for my wife and she&#x27;s been very happy with them.  </li>
      <li>Great theory</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this item, seems to be well made and the price was great.</li>
      <li>So, if you don&#x27;t want to apply heat to a good portion of your face in addition to your eye sockets, this may not be the product for you.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for one of the two pack catching fire in the microwave after approx 4 seconds.</li>
      <li>Made better by supplying two masks.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It is a surprisingly effective and comfortable light-blocking mask as well.</li>
      <li>Using this product along with my eye drops once a day has helped  my eyes to feel better.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>and my eyes feel much better when I stick to this regimen. :-)</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Using this mask at night has greatly alleviated the pain and scratchiness.  </li>
      <li>It is very comfortable and easily adjustable</li>
      <li>Works pretty good.</li>
      <li>Recipient very happy with this product versus her dry eye problem.</li>
      <li>I believe I have a smallish head and face and they fit me fine and very comfortable.</li>
      <li>The mask is easy to heat and apply, and it holds the heat about 8-10 minutes.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and does not require a lot of time.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use and not expensive.</li>
      <li>The nose bridge is comfortable.</li>
      <li>So quick and easy</li>
      <li>For people with dry eye, these are great...</li>
      <li>It is good to be able to change them up every other night.  </li>
      <li>This is a very good product and provides fast relief from dry eyes.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if they made a smaller size.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re doing this for MGD, you&#x27;ll probably end up re-heating it in the middle of your warm compress to reach over 10 minutes to ensure the warmth travels through your eyelids to the Meibomian glands below.</li>
      <li>My only wish is that longevity was more than six months.</li>
      <li>It covers my lower forehead, both eyes, upper cheeks, and most of both temples.</li>
      <li>The quality is consistent from batch to batch.</li>
      <li>Really does the trick!</li>
      <li>I just wish I was disciplined enough to use it more often.</li>
      <li>These do exactly what is advertised.</li>
      <li>NOTE to Thermalon ;-)</li>
      <li>So, if you need to do warm compresses twice a day, you&#x27;ll need a spare to use when the other one is drying.</li>
      <li>As you can see from the product photo, the mask is large.</li>
      <li>I put this on for 5 minutes and it really helps the situation.</li>
      <li>Very soothing.</li>
      <li>So much easier to use than messy, wet washcloths--and MUCH more effective.</li>
      <li>These work really well.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t fit great on small persons with narrow set eyes.  </li>
      <li>the construction seems fine and it does a decent job of heating and staying warm, it just isn&#x27;t very convenient to use due to the poor quality control.</li>
      <li>and I have a new pair of eyes.</li>
      <li>bought this for my wife, she feels just a little to hot right out of the micro oven</li>
      <li>I pop it in the microwave for the 20-30 seconds, put some soft music on, set timer and relax.</li>
      <li>but it does not stay hot very long, not even 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t messy, like a wet washcloth, and it is very comfortable.</li>
      <li>After 20 seconds in the microwave it really relieves my dry eyes.</li>
      <li>living in a very dry climate I have found them to be very helpful</li>
      <li>Much easier than having to wet a washcloth.</li>
      <li>They leave your eyes feeling refreshed and not dry or itching.  </li>
      <li>It is too early in my use of it to know if the Compress will solve my dry eye problem.</li>
      <li>I am an optometrist and prescribe these for my patients with meibomian gland dysfunction related dry eye frequently.  </li>
      <li>I think the mask helps because of a combination of the warmth - which releases the eye&#x27;s natural oils - and also, since I keep the mask on all night (after it cools down), the gentle pressure probably helps keep my lids closed.  </li>

    <li> You will need two of these. They must be washed weekly, and cannot be used again until they dry 24 hours. So, if you need to do warm compresses twice a day, you&#x27;ll need a spare to use when the other one is drying. As you can see from the product photo, the mask is large. It covers my lower forehead, both eyes, upper cheeks, and most of both temples. So, if you don&#x27;t want to apply heat to a good portion of your face in addition to your eye sockets, this may not be the product for you. The nose bridge is comfortable. The mask is easy to heat and apply, and it holds the heat about 8-10 minutes. If you&#x27;re doing this for MGD, you&#x27;ll probably end up re-heating it in the middle of your warm compress to reach over 10 minutes to ensure the warmth travels through your eyelids to the Meibomian glands below. I replace these every six months. The quality is consistent from batch to batch.</li>

    <li> These do exactly what is advertised. living in a very dry climate I have found them to be very helpful</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. I pop it in the microwave for the 20-30 seconds, put some soft music on, set timer and relax. The velcro straps work well for my big cranium.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for one of the two pack catching fire in the microwave after approx 4 seconds. Discovered a small wire upon further inspection after the flame was out. Pay CLOSE attention when heating.</li>
    <li> Got these for a friend with dry eye. He loves them. Dr told him to put heat on his eyes for 10 mins 2x a day. These are perfect for that.</li>
    <li> The Dry Eye Compress works as advertised.  It is easy to use and does not require a lot of time.  It is too early in my use of it to know if the Compress will solve my dry eye problem.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s vaugely what it is supposed to be.  The problem I have with both of them (I got a 2-pack) is that they&#x27;re filled very unevenly making it difficult to wear and keep in contact with both eyes.  The point of a product like this with a headband should be hands-free use but unfortunately that is not the case.  Other than that problem the construction seems fine and it does a decent job of heating and staying warm, it just isn&#x27;t very convenient to use due to the poor quality control.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Made better by supplying two masks.  It is good to be able to change them up every other night.  Using this product along with my eye drops once a day has helped  my eyes to feel better.</li>
    <li> For people with dry eye, these are great...30 sec in the micro and you have something that lasts 10 minutes or so and stimulates your eyes to secrete the oils they need.</li>
    <li> Great theory but it does not stay hot very long, not even 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> The two I bought from Amazon supplement the one I bought at WalMart that is nearing its use by date.  Thermalon works well a couple times a day instead of artificial tears for my dry eye.  My eye doctor seconded my choice.  My only wish is that longevity was more than six months.</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife, she feels just a little to hot right out of the micro oven</li>
    <li> Love this product. After 20 seconds in the microwave it really relieves my dry eyes.</li>
    <li> I have to use this morning and night per my eye doctor and I love it. So quick and easy and my eyes feel much better when I stick to this regimen. :-)</li>
    <li> Second purchase of this item for treatment of dry eyes. So much easier to use than messy, wet washcloths--and MUCH more effective. The warmth and light-blocking effects of using this at bedtime even helps me fall asleep faster and easier--very soothing. **Now, if I could find a teeny, inexpensive microwave to use upstairs instead of traipsing up and down the steps to the kitchen every night! NOTE to Thermalon ;-)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  When my eyes are uncomfortable, 5 or so minutes with Thermalon Dry  Eye Compress and I have a new pair of eyes.</li>
    <li> Recipient very happy with this product versus her dry eye problem.</li>
    <li> I try to use this once or twice a day. It helps with my dry eyes.</li>
    <li> This is moist heat which can be conveniently heated in the microwave oven.  It helps to relieve my dry eye symptoms.</li>
    <li> This does help my dry eyes. Very easy to use and not expensive. Much easier than having to wet a washcloth.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and provides fast relief from dry eyes. It isn&#x27;t messy, like a wet washcloth, and it is very comfortable. I don&#x27;t use the Velcro tabs ~ just lay it across my eyes. I&#x27;m actually giving this item as a Christmas gift to a family member who has dry eyes. It&#x27;s a GREAT find!</li>
    <li> My eye doctor told me that my oil glands in my lower lid were clogged and that I should apply heat and express them. I put this on for 5 minutes and it really helps the situation. It is very comfortable and easily adjustable</li>
    <li> Really does the trick! Very soothing. I just wish I was disciplined enough to use it more often.</li>
    <li> I am an optometrist and prescribe these for my patients with meibomian gland dysfunction related dry eye frequently.  I ordered these for my wife and she&#x27;s been very happy with them.  The price here was cheaper than at the pharmacy.  They don&#x27;t fit great on small persons with narrow set eyes.  It would be nice if they made a smaller size.</li>
    <li> Too bad this doesn&#x27;t come in two sizes. It&#x27;s big enough for the largest man&#x27;s eyes but overflows my average woman&#x27;s face. Keeps its heat for about 5 minutes but not the 8-10 my ophthalmologist recommends.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this item, seems to be well made and the price was great.</li>
    <li> These work really well.  They leave your eyes feeling refreshed and not dry or itching.  I believe I have a smallish head and face and they fit me fine and very comfortable.</li>
