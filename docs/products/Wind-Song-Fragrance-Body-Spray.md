    <li> Wind Song has been around my whole life and I had never used it before, but the body spray is wonderful.  Just enough lingering fragrance, not overpowering.  And the delivery (standard) time was exceptional, almost overnight.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling body spray I have ever used. It is not to heavy but stays smelling great all day so i don&#x27;t have to reapply.</li>

    <li> I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My mother, who is 94, has worn Wind Song for a long time.  I am unable to get it here.  Amazon had what I was looking for and I was able to give my mother Wind Song Body Spray for Christmas.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great smell, not too over powering, and just gives a hint of it&#x27;s earthy scent. Reasonably priced and the smell lasts for quite some time</li>

    <li> This is the only body spray that I use.  It&#x27;s so light and it smells good.  Everywhere I go people (especially women) ask me what is that fragrance I&#x27;m wearing?  The product was packaged well, and it arrived within the stated time.</li>

    <li> We get this every Christmas for Mom and she uses it, and reminds us at the end of summer &amp;#34;don&#x27;t forget my Windsong&amp;#34;. Amazon makes it very easy to purchase this for her...</li>

    <li> This was a gift from my husband and he was under the impression when he ordered it that it was a fragrance spray (perfume).  It is actually a deodorant spray not a perfume spray.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> This does what it is supposed to do, but not sure if I will use it as much as I thought I would.  Works well, and the fragrance is very light.  Nice in the closet and in a lingerie drawer.</li>

    <li> Not a pleasant smell! Also sticky when first sprayed, please bring back impulse spray deoderant:)</li>
    <li> Wind Song is one of the most delightful smelling body sprays that I own but a 5 oz can cost only 99 cents in retail stores</li>
    <li> My wife loves Wing Song and has been unable to find it in stores.</li>
    <li> Bought for a gift for my wife.  She loves it.  I love the way she smells</li>
    <li> I like it, but the propellant smell over rides the fragrance.</li>
