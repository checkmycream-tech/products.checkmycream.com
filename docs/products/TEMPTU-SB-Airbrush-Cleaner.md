      <li>It works excellant on cleaning your airbrush and doesn&#x27;t clog it up however I have found it gives the airbrush a a little boost in cleaning out well better than water.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to the airbrush makeup world, but I highly recommend this product for cleaning your air gun if you happen to be using silicon based products.</li>
      <li>Oily in the machine, and you have to rinse thoroughly before putting in new makeup</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t clear the clog in my tempts w this oil.</li>
      <li>I rinse the cup with water and then add about 1 teaspoon of solution and spray until the mist is clear.</li>
      <li>Because the makeup was so shoddy and wouldn&#x27;t go through the machine, I tried this product, and it didn&#x27;t clean out any of the makeup!</li>
      <li>A little expensive considering I run this through a few times but as far as how it works....works GREAT!</li>
      <li>and it cleans very fast with using only a small amount of product</li>

    <li> I use this to clean my airbrush aftermath use. Simply put, it works well and does,the job.  It is designed for Temptu products and may not clean other products as well, but used with Temptu makeup. It&#x27;s the ticket!  Though the price is far higher from this seller than Temptu. With their occasional sales, you would be better to wait and stock up.</li>
