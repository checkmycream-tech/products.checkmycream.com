      <li>It smells great and works great too.  </li>
      <li>It works well and smells amazing!  </li>
      <li>But I suppose there&#x27;s a tradeoff between washability and good hold, so I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Hairspray smells good and does a good job of holding hair without sticky residue.  </li>
      <li>Great product for kids (and sometimes parents too :)  </li>
      <li>I love this hairspray!  </li>
      <li>Just love this stuff, won&#x27;t buy anything else for me or my daughters...and smells delish!  </li>
      <li>We love this hair spray and use it almost every day on our toddler&#x27;s hair!  </li>
      <li>Hold is great, hair looks and feels nice, and the vanilla smell is strong but nice.</li>
      <li>This is a nice item for kids and adults.</li>
      <li>, it has good hold and it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave residue (washes out easily).  </li>
      <li>The vanilla fragrance is light and pleasant, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>This hairspray is great for kids due to the very pleasant vanilla scent.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>What more can you ask for.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray for my daughter.  </li>
      <li>someone make an extra-strong-hold non-aerosol hairspray with this scent!! :-)</li>
      <li>Even though this is for kids I bought this for myself because I love vanilla scent</li>
      <li>Then I apply Valerie&#x27;s Vanilla Freeze to make my hair smell better.</li>
      <li>The hair spray offers really great hold that lasts for many hours at a time.</li>
      <li>We really like both the smell and the hold on this product, and I feel good about using it in my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
      <li>I love the smell of vanilla and this French Vanilla hairspray smells great.</li>
      <li>but this one gives body to my fine hair without sacrificing softness.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff tremendously.</li>
      <li>and I have not been able to find a hairspray that smells nice without competing with my perfume, with this soft vanilla scent any perfume would blend with this.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for school and everyday activities.</li>
      <li>Smells very vanilla nice and works well.  </li>
      <li>However, it is a light hold, pretty much just good to help prevent fly-aways.</li>
      <li>Nice light scent and not heavy or sticky.  </li>
      <li>Although this product is marketed at children, there is no reason at all why adults should imagine that it won&#x27;t be good enough for their needs.  </li>
      <li>And, because Amazon did not honor my request to cancel the auto-ship, I now have two full bottles I will never use up.</li>
      <li>I, as an adult, absolutely love using this as a finishing spray all over my hair.</li>
      <li>At first I thought the scent was really light, but later I was pleased to find I could still smell vanilla in my hair.</li>
      <li>If you have a child that is prone to frizzy hair, or who&#x27;s hairstyle you worked so hard to get just right, barely stays put, then this is the perfect spray for them.</li>
      <li>Alas, the holding power of this spray is also light -- so light, in fact, that it didn&#x27;t work at all on my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Will buy here again since the price is reasonable as well.</li>
      <li>So I use a stronger-hold nasty-smelling spray (as they all seem to be) to really hold the style &amp; reduce frizz from humidity.</li>
      <li>The smell is very heavenly.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that my cap broke, so I had to throw away almost a full bottle of this spray.</li>
      <li>There are no flakes or residues left like most hair sprays, and the smell is easy on the sinuses and definitely not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This has quickly become my favourite hairspray, and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it for as long as it exists.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about \\&quot;hold\\&quot; because I&#x27;m only interested in creating the appearance of thicker..</li>
      <li>We &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; her hair first - pulled back with a bow, put it in pigtails, etc - and use the hairspray to set that part of the style.  </li>
      <li>It is soft to medium hold and adds shine!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an older adult and this hairspray leaves my hair soft, shiny, and with just a hint of vanilla.</li>
      <li>As long as this product is available it is the only hairspray I will use.  </li>
      <li>Not drying like adult hair sprays.</li>
      <li>(Using the hairspray on her entire head is too crunchy and we need the moisture of the mousse to help form the curls; if we just sprayed her whole head with hairspray it would be a frizzy</li>
      <li>It is not going to make their hair so stiff that the wind won&#x27;t mess it up, but it will provide a gentle and light hold.</li>
      <li>The price is a premium over regular spray, but at this age we don&#x27;t use much and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>My daughter is 3 years old and has a lot of baby hair that i need to pull back into her ponytail.</li>
      <li>I Amanda adult, and this is the only hairspray I use.</li>
      <li>We would never want to spray our kids with chemical filled hair sprays, or use harsh gels or other products.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product on my kids since they were babies. Not drying like adult hair sprays.</li>
    <li> Although this product is marketed at children, there is no reason at all why adults should imagine that it won&#x27;t be good enough for their needs.  This has quickly become my favourite hairspray, and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it for as long as it exists.  It never leaves any dusty residue in my hair and it has a mild and fruity smell that reminds me of scratch n&#x27; sniff stickers from the eighties.  The French-Canadian theme of the product is also delightful.</li>
    <li> This is the best product- I love it.  We have gone through at least a dozen bottles on my 2 daughters and myself. It smells great and works great too.  What more can you ask for. As long as this product is available it is the only hairspray I will use.  I am never with out one on hand.</li>
    <li> We really like both the smell and the hold on this product, and I feel good about using it in my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray!  I&#x27;m an older adult and this hairspray leaves my hair soft, shiny, and with just a hint of vanilla. I haven&#x27;t used hairspray in years but this one gives body to my fine hair without sacrificing softness. I don&#x27;t know about \\&quot;hold\\&quot; because I&#x27;m only interested in creating the appearance of thicker..\\&quot;fluffy\\&quot;..hair.  In my opinion, this product is as good as hairspray gets!</li>
    <li> Even though this is for kids I bought this for myself because I love vanilla scent and I have not been able to find a hairspray that smells nice without competing with my perfume, with this soft vanilla scent any perfume would blend with this.  It is soft to medium hold and adds shine!</li>
    <li> Smells very vanilla nice and works well.  My daughter is 3 years old and has a lot of baby hair that i need to pull back into her ponytail. This does the trick.  The only problem is that my cap broke, so I had to throw away almost a full bottle of this spray.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a keeper!  Bought for kids but keeping for myself.  Yum</li>
    <li> I love the smell of vanilla and this French Vanilla hairspray smells great. I use it to control the frizziness in my hair and after I&#x27;ve flattened my bob. At first I thought the scent was really light, but later I was pleased to find I could still smell vanilla in my hair. This is a nice item for kids and adults. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> We love this hair spray and use it almost every day on our toddler&#x27;s hair!  She has curly hair (1/2&amp;#34; to 1&amp;#34; diameter) and we actually use two different products (this hairspray and Suave Kids Cherry Vanilla Mousse).  We &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; her hair first - pulled back with a bow, put it in pigtails, etc - and use the hairspray to set that part of the style.  Then we use the mousse on the loose curls in the back.  (Using the hairspray on her entire head is too crunchy and we need the moisture of the mousse to help form the curls; if we just sprayed her whole head with hairspray it would be a frizzy mess.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairspray smells wonderful (girly, that is) and my daughter doesn&#x27;t mind it at all.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to wash out; the sections of her hair where we spray this always feel pretty crunchy when I&#x27;m washing it (and even a little stiff after washing), and I feel like I have to give her hair a &amp;#34;day off&amp;#34; from hair product occasionally to get it really clean.  But I suppose there&#x27;s a tradeoff between washability and good hold, so I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Oh boy. I love this stuff tremendously. I Amanda adult, and this is the only hairspray I use. It holds well, smells wonderful. It is a little pricey, but it lasts a very long time for me. My husband occasionally is disappointed if he comes one after I&#x27;ve used it. He smelled and expected baked goods. It just my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray for my daughter.  She always smells a little like cookies when you hug (even her 1st grade teacher commented!), it has good hold and it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave residue (washes out easily).  The price is a premium over regular spray, but at this age we don&#x27;t use much and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Nice light scent and not heavy or sticky.  Great product for kids (and sometimes parents too :)  Will buy here again since the price is reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> The smell is very heavenly. The hair spray offers really great hold that lasts for many hours at a time.</li>
    <li> Hairspray smells good and does a good job of holding hair without sticky residue.  My daughter and I both use it.</li>
    <li> Hold is great, hair looks and feels nice, and the vanilla smell is strong but nice. It works on both my 4-year-old and myself. (My only concern was that the smell might attract bees.)</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using this on my 2 year old daughter, too bad the smell is horrible. I wanted to return it by just found out I cant.  : (</li>
    <li> I use this for myself and for my girls when they need to keep flyaways under control(photo time). I don&#x27;t like heavy holds or chemicals so this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Just love this stuff, won&#x27;t buy anything else for me or my daughters...and smells delish!  Buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have two small girls with very curly hair.  This hairspray is great for kids.  It works well and smells amazing!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>

There are no flakes or residues left like most hair sprays, and the smell is easy on the sinuses and definitely not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Freeze spray my ass. This is the weakest hair spray I have ever seen. I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is great for kids due to the very pleasant vanilla scent. I, as an adult, absolutely love using this as a finishing spray all over my hair. However, it is a light hold, pretty much just good to help prevent fly-aways. So I use a stronger-hold nasty-smelling spray (as they all seem to be) to really hold the style &amp; reduce frizz from humidity. Then I apply Valerie&#x27;s Vanilla Freeze to make my hair smell better. PLEASE OH PLEASE... someone make an extra-strong-hold non-aerosol hairspray with this scent!! :-)</li>
    <li> After trying this hairspray, I decided it&#x27;s rather obsolete. The vanilla fragrance is light and pleasant, not overpowering. Alas, the holding power of this spray is also light -- so light, in fact, that it didn&#x27;t work at all on my fine hair. And, because Amazon did not honor my request to cancel the auto-ship, I now have two full bottles I will never use up.</li>
